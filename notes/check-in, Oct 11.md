—Testimony trends in relation to other environmental and/or industry groups (for fundraising purposes)

—Who is most likely to be on opposite sides of a bill (how to use directionality), likely to agree or less likely to agree. Construct a matrix of org to org connections and then normalize that so just the stronger connections are shown. No need for NetworkX or anything like that. Most of that analysis is a correlation matrix and then dumped into NetworkX as an adjacency matrix to visualize.

—Volunteer vs. staff testimony

—AI agent to look up other information or metadata

—Can probably spin up a small semi-supervised dataset for for or against

—Annotation tool — would be nice if someone could look at this and select text where it says I support. Use one for work that has a free plan and could crowdsource that for labels. SuperAnnotate — currently one of the things we’re planning to use. Give it a data source and tell it how you want it to sample and then raw text and PDF display allows you to select the part that is most compelling or is the author’s name or title.
