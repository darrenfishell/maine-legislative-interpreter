38 of a request, the department shall conduct a review of the person's criminal history to ensure 
39 the person is eligible under subsection 2. Upon a determination that the person is eligible, 
40 the department shall notify the court having jurisdiction over the crime on which the

4 section 393, subsection 1, paragraph A-1 or C. Restoration of civil rights under this section 
5 is within the meaning of civil rights restored under the federal Firearms Owners' Protection 
6 Act, 18 United States Code, Section 921(a)(20).
75. Subsequent conviction. If a person who has had the person's civil rights restored 
8 under this section is subsequently convicted of any felony crime in this State or in another 
9 jurisdiction, the person's right to own, possess and have under that person's control a 
10 firearm is revoked, the person is ineligible from qualifying for a restoration of civil rights 
11 under this section and the court that issued the order restoring the person's rights under 
12 subsection 3 shall revoke the order.
13SUMMARY
14 Currently, persons who have been convicted of committing or found not criminally 
15 responsible by reason of insanity of committing a crime in this State, a crime under the 
16 laws of the United States and certain crimes in other jurisdictions that are punishable by a 
17 term of imprisonment of one year or more are prohibited from owning, possessing or 
18 having under their control a firearm. This bill restores the right for some of these convicted 
19 persons to own, possess and have a firearm under their control, setting certain eligibility 
20 requirements a person must meet to have their civil rights relating to firearms restored, 
21 including a requirement that 10 years have passed since the completion of any sentence 
22 imposed on them. Eligibility for restoration of firearm rights is excluded for certain 
23 enumerated categories of crimes, including murder; any Class A crime; any Class B or C 
24 crime in violation of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, chapter 9, 11, 12, 13, 33 or 
25 45; robbery; assault on an officer; assault on an emergency medical care provider; assault 
26 on a firefighter; aggravated sex trafficking; and sex trafficking. 
27 The bill also outlines the procedure for applying for a restoration of civil rights. A 
28 person meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a request to the Department of 
29 Public Safety to have that person's firearm rights restored. Upon receipt of a request, the 
30 department must conduct a review of the person's criminal history to ensure the person is 
31 eligible. Upon a determination that the person is eligible, the department must notify the 
32 court having jurisdiction over the crime for which the person's firearm prohibition is based, 
33 and that court must issue an order restoring the person's rights.
34 The bill also stipulates that, in the event a person who has had the person's civil rights 
35 restored is subsequently convicted of any felony crime, defined as a crime punishable by a 
36 sentence of imprisonment of one year or more in Maine or any other jurisdiction, that 
37 person's restored rights are revoked and the person is ineligible from qualifying for a 
38 restoration of that person's rights in the future. In this occurrence, the court that issued the 
39 order restoring the person's civil rights to own, possess and have under the person's control 
40 a firearm must revoke that order.14
