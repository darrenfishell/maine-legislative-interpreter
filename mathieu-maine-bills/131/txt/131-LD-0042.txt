401.  Required.  As a condition to the continued employment of any person as a

42 employment, a basic training course as approved by the board.  For a corrections officer 
Page 3 - 131LR0129(01)43 who is responsible for the custody or supervision of persons confined in a juvenile facility, 
44 the board may approve a separate basic training course.  Thereafter, as a condition of

46 basic certification.  The board, under extenuating and emergency circumstances in 
47 individual cases, may extend the 12-month period for not more than 180 days.  The board,

49 equivalent course has been successfully completed in another state or federal jurisdiction.  
50 A full-time correctional trade instructor must meet the training requirements established 
51 under this subsection for corrections officers.  Beginning January 1, 2018, the basic training

53 of mental illnesses and substance use disorder that is provided by a trainer who is certified 
54 by a nationally recognized organization that provides evidence-based mental health first 
55 aid training.
14SUMMARY
15 This bill defines "Department of Corrections law enforcement officer" and gives the 
16 Commissioner of Corrections, rather than the Chief of the State Police, the authority over 
17 death benefits for Department of Corrections law enforcement officers.
18 The bill allows the Board of Trustees of the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to 
19 approve a separate training course for corrections officers working in juvenile facilities.  
20 The bill also removes a reference to "first aid" in the law requiring training for corrections 
21 officers related to identifying mental illness and substance use disorder.1
