Page 1 - 131LR1944(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA §2002, sub-§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2021, c. 296, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 B.  "Critical investigation expense" means a necessary expense incurred by a 
5 government or by a victim while investigating or prosecuting suspected criminal 
6 conduct.  "Critical investigation expense" is limited to the cost of an audit or other 
7 financial analysis when that analysis is necessary to determine whether and to what 
8 extent a victim has suffered financial harm from criminal conduct by an employee or 
9 other person in a position of trust and the cost of analysis of suspected illegal drugs if 
10 the defendant is convicted of trafficking a scheduled drug under chapter 45 and the 
11 court in sentencing the defendant makes a finding that the conduct underlying the 
12 conviction was motivated by profit.
13SUMMARY
14 This bill amends provisions of the Maine Criminal Code regarding restitution paid by 
15 defendants by removing the current requirement that a defendant may be ordered to pay 
16 restitution for the cost of analysis of suspected illegal drugs only if the defendant is 
17 convicted of trafficking a scheduled drug and the court in sentencing finds that the 
18 defendant's conduct was motivated by profit.14
