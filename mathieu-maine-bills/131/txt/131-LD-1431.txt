Page 1 - 131LR1711(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §2112 is enacted to read:
3§2112.  Energy transformation projects
41. Definition. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, "energy 
5 transformation project" means an undertaking that provides energy-related goods or 
6 services but does not include the generation of electricity and that results in a net reduction 
7 in fossil fuel consumption by the customers of a retail electricity provider and in the 
8 emission of greenhouse gases attributable to that consumption. 
92. Energy transformation projects.  The commission shall adopt rules to incentivize 
10 participation by competitive electricity providers and others in energy transformation 
11 projects, including projects that support:
12 A. Home weatherization or other thermal energy efficiency measures; 
13 B. Air source or geothermal heat pumps; 
14 C. High-efficiency heating systems; 
15 D. Increased use of biofuels; 
16 E. Biomass heating systems; 
17 F. Transportation demand management strategies; 
18 G. Electric vehicles or related infrastructure; or
19 H. Infrastructure for the storage of renewable energy on the electric grid.
20Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3110 is enacted to read:
21§3110.  Social cost of carbon
221. Definition. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, "social 
23 cost of carbon" means an estimate, in dollars, of the economic damages that would result 
24 from emitting one additional ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
252. Commission rules or rate-making decisions. In adopting a rule regarding electric 
26 rates or a rate-making decision, the commission shall consider the social cost of carbon.
27Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3196 is enacted to read:
28§3196.  Commission authority to promote distributed energy resources
29 The commission shall promote the use of distributed energy resources. As used in this 
30 section, "distributed energy resources" means a nonemitting electric generation or 
31 renewable resource or program that reduces electric demand, manages the level or timing 
32 of electricity consumption or provides storage, electric energy, capacity or ancillary 
33 services to an electric utility and that is located on the distribution system, any subsystem 
34 of the distribution system or on the consumer's side of the meter.
35Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3210, sub-§8, as amended by PL 2019, c. 477, §1, is further 
36 amended to read:
378.  Credit trading.  The commission shall allow competitive electricity providers to 
38 satisfy the portfolio requirements of subsections 3, 3‑A, 3‑B and 3‑C through the use of 
Page 2 - 131LR1711(01)39 renewable energy credits if the commission determines that a reliable system of electrical 
40 attribute trading exists.  The commission  shall adopt rules to implement a reliable system 
41 of electrical attribute trading. When renewable energy credits are used to satisfy the 
42 portfolio requirements of subsections 3 and 3‑A, the value of a renewable energy credit for 
43 electricity generated by a community-based renewable energy project, as defined in section 
44 3602, that is participating in the community-based renewable energy pilot program 
45 established in section 3603 and elects the renewable energy credit multiplier under section 
46 3605 is 150% of the amount of the electricity. A competitive electricity provider that does 
47 not satisfy the portfolio requirements as required in this section is subject to an 
48 administrative penalty in the amount of $100 per ton of carbon emitted annually from 
49 sources that do not satisfy the portfolio requirements.  Rules adopted pursuant to this 
50 subsection are routine technical rules as defined by Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
13SUMMARY
14 This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules to incentivize 
15 participation by competitive electricity providers and others in energy transformation 
16 projects, to adopt rules implementing a reliable system of electrical attribute trading, to 
17 promote the use of distributed energy resources and to consider the social cost of carbon in 
18 ratemaking and adopting rules.1
