Page 1 - 131LR1878(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §201, sub-§3-A, ¶B, as amended by PL 2021, c. 629, §2, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 B.  The employee is a law enforcement officer, corrections officer, E-9-1-1 dispatcher, 
5 firefighter or , emergency medical services person or line worker for a consumer-owned 
6 transmission and distribution utility or an investor-owned transmission and distribution 
7 utility and is diagnosed by an allopathic physician or an osteopathic physician licensed 
8 under Title 32, chapter 48 or chapter 36, respectively, with a specialization in 
9 psychiatry or a psychologist licensed under Title 32, chapter 56 as having post-
10 traumatic stress disorder that resulted from work stress, that the work stress was 
11 extraordinary and unusual compared with that experienced by the average employee 
12 and the work stress and not some other source of stress was the predominant cause of 
13 the post-traumatic stress disorder, in which case the post-traumatic stress disorder is 
14 presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the worker's employment.  This 
15 presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.  For 
16 purposes of this paragraph, "law enforcement officer," "corrections officer," 
17 "firefighter" and "emergency medical services person" have the same meaning as in 
18 section 328‑A, subsection 1.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "E-9-1-1 dispatcher" 
19 means a person who receives calls made to the E-9-1-1 system and dispatches 
20 emergency services.  "E-9-1-1 dispatcher" includes an emergency medical dispatcher 
21 as defined in Title 32, chapter 2‑B, section 85‑A, subsection 1, paragraph D.  For the 
22 purposes of this paragraph, "consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility" has 
23 the same meaning as in Title 35-A, section 3201, subsection 6 and "investor-owned 
24 transmission and distribution utility" has the same meaning as in Title 35-A, section 
25 3104, subsection 1, paragraph A.
26 Each time the Legislature amends this paragraph to provide for a rebuttable 
27 presumption for a new category of employees, the board shall submit a report to the 
28 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters no 
29 later than the January 1st after the 5th year of the addition of the category of employees 
30 and no later than the January 1st after the 10th year of the addition of the category of 
31 employees. The reports must include an analysis of the number of claims brought under 
32 this paragraph, the portion of those claims that resulted in a settlement or award of 
33 benefits and the effect of the provisions of this paragraph on costs to the State and its 
34 subdivisions.  The Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 
35 Human Resources and the Department of Public Safety shall assist the board in 
36 developing the reports, and the board shall seek the input of an association the 
37 membership whose consists exclusively of counties, municipalities and other political 
38 or administrative subdivisions in the development of the report.
39 This paragraph is repealed October 1, 2025.
