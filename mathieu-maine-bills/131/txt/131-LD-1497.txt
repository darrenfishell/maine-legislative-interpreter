Page 1 - 131LR2386(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, currently Maine does not have a law that prohibits health care providers 
4 from adding excess charges to a Medicare beneficiary’s bill; and
5Whereas, 8 states have enacted such a law, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, 
6 Rhode Island and Vermont; and
7Whereas, such additional charges can be financially devastating for Medicare 
8 beneficiaries on fixed incomes; and
9Whereas, for the benefit of Medicare beneficiaries in this State, this bill prohibits 
10 health care providers from adding these excess charges; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §1718-H is enacted to read:
17§1718-H.  Balance billing of Medicare beneficiaries prohibited
181.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
19 following terms have the following meanings. 
20 A.  "Balance bill" means to charge to or collect from a Medicare beneficiary any 
21 amount in excess of the reasonable charge for a service, procedure or treatment paid to 
22 a provider under the Medicare program.
23 B.  "Medicare" means the "Health Insurance for the Aged Act," Title XVIII of the 
24 federal Social Security Amendments of 1965, Public Law 89-97, as amended.
25 C.  "Medicare beneficiary" means a person who is a beneficiary of health insurance 
26 under Medicare.
27 D.  "Provider" has the same meaning as in Title 24‑A, section 4301‑A, subsection 16.  
282.  Balance billing prohibited.  A provider may not balance bill a Medicare 
29 beneficiary for any service, procedure or treatment provided to the Medicare beneficiary. 
303.  Reimbursement for excess charges.  If a provider receives payment from a 
31 Medicare beneficiary for which the Medicare beneficiary is not responsible pursuant to this 
32 section, the provider shall reimburse the Medicare beneficiary within 30 calendar days after 
33 the earlier of the date that the provider received notice of the overpayment and the date the 
34 provider became aware of the overpayment.  A provider that fails to reimburse a Medicare 
35 beneficiary for any overpayment as required by this subsection shall pay interest on the 
36 overpayment at the rate of 10% per annum beginning on the earlier of the date the provider 
37 received notice of the overpayment and the date the provider became aware of the 
38 overpayment. A Medicare beneficiary is not required to request the accrued interest from 
39 the provider in order to receive interest with the reimbursement amount.  
Page 2 - 131LR2386(01)14.  Notice.  A provider who treats Medicare beneficiaries shall post a summary of the 
2 provisions of this section in a conspicuous place in the provider's office.
3Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
4 takes effect when approved.

8 paid to that entity under the Medicare program.6
