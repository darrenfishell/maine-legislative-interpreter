Page 1 - 131LR1271(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  25 MRSA §2452, first ¶, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 691, Pt. 
3 A, §25, is amended to read:
4 The Commissioner of Public Safety shall adopt and may amend rules governing the 
5 safety to life from fire in or around all buildings or other structures and mass outdoor 
6 gatherings, as defined in Title 22, section 1601, subsection 2, within the commissioner's 
7 jurisdiction. Automatic sprinkler systems may not be required in existing noncommercial 
8 places of assembly. Noncommercial places of assembly include those facilities used for 
9 such purposes as deliberation, worship, entertainment, amusement or awaiting 
10 transportation that have a capacity of 100 to 300 persons.  Automatic sprinkler systems 
11 may not be required in existing commercial places of assembly that are open for no more 
12 than 50 days per calendar year.  "Commercial places of assembly" includes bars with live 
13 entertainment, dance halls, nightclubs, assembly halls with large open areas in which 
14 patrons stand or sit, commonly referred to as "festival seating," and restaurants. Once 
15 installed, an automatic sprinkler system in a building that is within 25 feet of another 
16 building may not be shut off for a reason other than short-term maintenance or a repair 
17 requiring the system to be shut off. Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine 
18 technical rules, except that rules pertaining to fire sprinklers are major substantive rules, 
19 both of which are defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
20SUMMARY
21 This bill amends the provisions of law giving the Commissioner of Public Safety 
22 authority to adopt or amend rules governing safety to life by prohibiting shutting off an 
23 automatic sprinkler system in a building that is within 25 feet of another building except 
24 for short-term maintenance or a repair requiring the system to be shut off.21
