4 region that requests and receives a financial assistance grant shall develop and implement 
5 its growth management program in cooperation with the department and in a manner 
6 consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter.

13Sec. 17.  30-A MRSA §4346, as amended by PL 2021, c. 590, Pt. A, §10, is further 
14 amended to read:
15§4346.  Technical and financial assistance program
16 The technical and financial assistance program for municipalities, regional councils 
17 and multimunicipal regions is established to encourage and facilitate the adoption and 
18 implementation of local, regional and statewide growth management programs.
19 The department may enter into financial assistance grants only to the extent that funds 
20 are available.  In making grants, the department shall consider the need for planning in a 
21 municipality or multimunicipal region, the proximity of the municipality or multimunicipal 
22 region to other areas that are conducting or have completed the planning process and the 
23 economic and geographic role of the municipality or multimunicipal region within a 
24 regional context.  The department shall give priority in making grants to any municipality 
25 or multimunicipal region that has adopted a local climate action plan and, if the 
26 municipality or multimunicipal region has adopted a comprehensive plan or growth 
27 management program, prepared a climate vulnerability assessment pursuant to section 
28 4326, subsection 1, paragraph L.  The department may consider other criteria in making 
29 grants, as long as the criteria support the goal of encouraging and facilitating the adoption 
30 and implementation of local and multimunicipal regional growth management programs 
31 consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter.  In order 
32 to maximize the availability of the technical and financial assistance program to all 
33 municipalities, multimunicipal regions and regional councils, financial assistance programs 
34 administered competitively under this article are exempt from rules adopted by the 
35 Department of Administrative and Financial Services pursuant to Title 5, section 1825‑C 
36 for use in the purchase of services and the awarding of grants and contracts.  The 
37 department shall publish a program statement describing its grant program and advertising 
38 its availability to eligible applicants.
392-A.  Financial assistance grants.  A contract for a financial assistance grant must:
40 A.  Provide for the payment of a specific amount for the purposes of planning and 
41 preparing a comprehensive plan;
42 B.  Provide for the payment of a specific amount for the purposes of implementing that 
43 plan; and
Page 21 - 131LR1377(01)1 C.  Include specific timetables governing the preparation and submission of products 
2 by the municipality or multimunicipal region.
3 The department may not require a municipality or multimunicipal region to provide 
4 matching funds in excess of 25% of the value of that municipality's or multimunicipal 
5 region's financial assistance contract for its first planning assistance grant and 
6 implementation assistance grant.  The department may require a higher match for other 
7 grants, including, but not limited to, grants for the purpose of updating comprehensive 
8 plans.  This match limitation does not apply to distribution of federal funds that the 
9 department may administer.
102-B.  Use of funds.  A municipality or multimunicipal region may expend financial 
11 assistance grants for:
12 A.  The conduct of surveys, inventories and other data-gathering activities;
13 B.  The hiring of planning and other technical staff;
14 C.  The retention of planning consultants;
15 D.  Contracts with regional councils for planning and related services;
16 E.  Assistance in the development of ordinances;
17 F.  Retention of technical and legal expertise;
18 G.  The updating of growth management programs or components of a program;
19 G-1.  Evaluation of growth management programs; and
20 H.  Any other purpose agreed to by the department and the municipality or 
21 multimunicipal region that is directly related to the preparation of a comprehensive 
22 plan or the implementation of a comprehensive plan adopted in accordance with the 
23 procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter.
242-C.  Program evaluation.  Any recipient of a financial assistance grant shall 
25 cooperate with the department in performing program evaluations required under section 
26 4331.
272-D.  Encumbered balances at year-end.  Notwithstanding Title 5, section 1589, at 
28 the end of each fiscal year, all encumbered balances accounts for financial assistance and 
29 regional planning grants may be carried forward for 2 years beyond the year in which those 
30 balances are encumbered.
313.  Technical assistance.  Using its own staff, the staff of other state agencies, 
32 contractors and the resources of the regional councils, the department shall provide 
33 technical assistance to municipalities or multimunicipal regions in the development, 
34 administration and enforcement of growth management programs.  The technical assistance 
35 component of the program must include a set of model land use ordinances or other 
36 implementation strategies developed by the department that are consistent with this 
37 subchapter.
384.  Regional council assistance.  As part of the technical and financial assistance 
39 program, the department may develop and administer a program to develop regional 
40 education and training programs, regional policies to address state goals and regional 
41 assessments.  Regional assessments may include, but are not limited to, public 
42 infrastructure, inventories of agricultural and commercial forest lands, housing needs, 
Page 22 - 131LR1377(01)43 recreation and open space needs, and projections of regional growth and economic 
44 development.  The program may include guidelines to ensure methodological consistency 
45 among the State's regional councils.  To implement this program, the department may 
46 contract with regional councils to assist the department in reviewing growth management 
47 programs, to develop necessary planning information at a regional level or to provide 
48 support for local planning efforts.
75.  Coordination.  State agencies with regulatory or other authority affecting the goals 
8 established in this subchapter shall conduct their respective activities in a manner consistent 
9 with the goals established under this subchapter, including, but not limited to, coordinating 
10 with municipalities, regional councils and other state agencies in meeting the state goals; 
11 providing available information to regions and municipalities as described in section 4326, 
12 subsection 1; cooperating with efforts to integrate and provide access to geographic 
13 information system data; making state investments and awarding grant money as described 
14 in section 4349‑A; and conducting reviews of growth management programs as provided 
15 in section 4347‑A, subsection 3, paragraph A.  Without limiting the application of this

27 affected by §41, is further amended to read:
28§4347-A.  Review of programs by department
291.  Comprehensive plans.  A municipality or multimunicipal region that chooses to 
30 prepare a growth management program and receives a planning grant under this article 
31 shall submit its comprehensive plan to the department for review.  A municipality or 
32 multimunicipal region that chooses to prepare a growth management program without 
33 receiving a planning grant under this article may submit its comprehensive plan to the 
34 department for review.  The department shall review plans for consistency with the 
35 procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter.  A contract for a planning 
36 assistance grant must include specific timetables governing the review of the 
37 comprehensive plan by the department.  A comprehensive plan submitted for review more 
38 than 12 months following a contract end date may be required to contain data, projections 
39 and other time-sensitive portions of the plan or program that are in compliance with the 
40 department's most current review standards.
412.  Growth management programs.  A municipality or multimunicipal region may at 
42 any time request a certificate of consistency for its growth management program.1

Page 23 - 131LR1377(01)1 A.  Upon a request for review under this section, the department shall review the 
2 program and determine whether the program is consistent with the procedures, goals 
3 and guidelines established in this subchapter.
4 B.  Certification by the former State Planning Office or the department of a 
5 municipality's or multimunicipal region's growth management program under this 
6 article is valid for 10 years.  To maintain certification, a municipality or multimunicipal 
7 region shall periodically review its growth management program and submit to the 
8 department in a timely manner any revisions necessary to account for changes, 
9 including changes caused by growth and development. Certification does not lapse in 
10 any year in which the Legislature does not appropriate funds to the department for the 
11 purposes of reviewing programs for recertification.
12 C.  Upon a request for review under this section, the department may review rate of 
13 growth, impact fee and zoning ordinances to determine whether the ordinances are 
14 consistent with a comprehensive plan that has been found consistent under this section 
15 without requiring submission of all elements of a growth management program.  An 
16 affirmative finding of consistency by the department is required for a municipality or 
17 multimunicipal region to assert jurisdiction as provided in section 4349‑A.
183.  Review of growth management program.  In reviewing a growth management 
19 program, the department shall:
20 A.  Solicit written comments on any proposed growth management program from 
21 regional councils, state agencies, all municipalities contiguous to the municipality or 
22 multimunicipal region submitting a growth management program and any interested 
23 residents of the municipality or multimunicipal region or of contiguous municipalities.  
24 The comment period extends for 45 days after the department receives the growth 
25 management program.
26 (1)  Each state agency reviewing the proposal shall designate a person or persons 
27 responsible for coordinating the agency's review of the growth management 
28 program.
29 (2)  Any regional council commenting on a growth management program shall 
30 determine whether the program is compatible with the programs of other 
31 municipalities that may be affected by the program and with regional policies or 
32 needs identified by the regional council;
33 B.  Prepare all written comments from all sources in a form to be forwarded to the 
34 municipality or multimunicipal region;
35 C.  Within 90 days after receiving the growth management program, send all written 
36 comments on the growth management program to the municipality or multimunicipal 
37 region and any applicable regional council.  If warranted, the department shall issue 
38 findings specifically describing how the submitted growth management program is not 
39 consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter and 
40 the recommended measures for remedying the deficiencies.
41 (1)  In its findings, the department shall clearly indicate its position on any point 
42 on which there are significant conflicts among the written comments submitted to 
43 the department.
Page 24 - 131LR1377(01)1 (2)  If the department finds that the growth management program was adopted in 
2 accordance with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this 
3 subchapter, the department shall issue a certificate of consistency for the growth 
4 management program.
5 (3)  Notwithstanding paragraph D, if a municipality or multimunicipal region 
6 requests a certificate of consistency for its growth management program, any 
7 unmodified component of that program that has previously been reviewed by the 
8 former State Planning Office or the department and has received a finding of 
9 consistency will retain that finding during program certification review by the 
10 department as long as the finding of consistency is current as defined in rules 
11 adopted by the department;
12 D.  Provide ample opportunity for the municipality or multimunicipal region 
13 submitting a growth management program to respond to and correct any identified 
14 deficiencies in the program.  A finding of inconsistency for a growth management 
15 program may be addressed within 24 months of the date of the finding without 
16 addressing any new review standards that are created during that time interval. After 
17 24 months, the program must be resubmitted in its entirety for state review under the 
18 department's most current review standards; and
19 E.  Provide an expedited review and certification procedure for those submissions that 
20 represent minor amendments to certified growth management programs.
21 The department's decision on consistency of a growth management program constitutes 
22 final agency action.
233-A.  Review of comprehensive plan.  In reviewing a comprehensive plan, the 
24 department shall:
25 A.  Solicit written comments on any proposed comprehensive plan from regional 
26 councils, state agencies, all municipalities contiguous to the municipality or 
27 multimunicipal region submitting a comprehensive plan and any interested residents 
28 of the municipality or multimunicipal region or of contiguous municipalities. The 
29 comment period extends for 25 business days after the department receives the 
30 comprehensive plan.  Each state agency reviewing the proposal shall designate a person 
31 or persons responsible for coordinating the agency's review of the comprehensive plan;
32 B.  Prepare all written comments from all sources in a form to be forwarded to the 
33 municipality or multimunicipal region;
34 C.  Within 35 business days after receiving the comprehensive plan, notify the 
35 municipality or multimunicipal region if the plan is complete for purposes of review.  
36 If the department notifies the municipality or multimunicipal region that the plan is not 
37 complete for purposes of review, the department shall indicate in its notice necessary 
38 additional data or information  the department shall issue findings based on a review of 
39 the requirements of this subchapter.  Comments unrelated to the required elements of 
40 this subchapter are advisory.  The written comments prepared under this section must 
41 distinguish between advisory and substantive comments;
42 D.  Within 10 business days of issuing notification that a comprehensive plan is 
43 complete for purposes of review, issue findings specifically describing whether the 
44 submitted plan is consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in 
Page 25 - 131LR1377(01)45 this subchapter and identify which inconsistencies in the plan, if any, may directly 
46 affect rate of growth, zoning or impact fee ordinances.
3 ( 1)  In its findings, the department shall clearly indicate its position on any point 
4 on which there are significant conflicts among the written comments submitted to 
5 the department.
6 ( 2)  If the department finds that the comprehensive plan was developed in 
7 accordance with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this 
8 subchapter, the department shall issue a finding of consistency for the 
9 comprehensive plan.
10 ( 3)  A finding of inconsistency must identify the goals under this subchapter not 
11 adequately addressed, specific sections of the rules relating to comprehensive plan 
12 review adopted by the department not adequately addressed and recommendations 
13 for resolving the inconsistency;
14 D-1.  If the department finds that the comprehensive plan was developed in accordance 
15 with the mandatory procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter, the 
16 department shall issue a finding of consistency for the comprehensive plan.  If the 
17 department finds that the comprehensive plan does not meet the requirements 
18 established in this subchapter, the department shall issue a finding of inconsistency and 
19 recommendations for resolving the inconsistency;
20 E.  Send all written findings and comments on the comprehensive plan to the 
21 municipality or multimunicipal region and any applicable regional council; and
22 F.  Provide ample opportunity for the municipality or multimunicipal region submitting 
23 a comprehensive plan to respond to and correct any identified deficiencies in the plan  
24 revise the plan to be consistent with the requirements of this subchapter. A finding of 
25 inconsistency for a comprehensive plan may be addressed within 24 months of the date 
26 of the finding without addressing any new review standards that are created during that 
27 time interval. After 24 months, the plan must be resubmitted in its entirety for state 
28 review under the department's most current review standards.
29 If the department finds that a plan is not consistent with the procedures, goals and 
30 guidelines requirements established in this subchapter, the municipality or multimunicipal 
31 district region that submitted the plan may appeal that finding to the department within 20 
32 business days of receipt of the finding in accordance with rules adopted by the department, 
33 which are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
34 The department's decision on consistency of a comprehensive plan constitutes final agency 
35 action.
36 A finding by the department pursuant to paragraph D D-1 that a comprehensive plan is 
37 consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines  requirements established in this 
38 subchapter is valid for 12 years from the date of its issuance.  A finding by the former State 
39 Planning Office issued pursuant to this subchapter prior to December 31, 2000 that a 
40 comprehensive plan is consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines  requirements 
41 established in this subchapter is valid until December 31, 2012.  For purposes of section 
42 4314, subsection 3 and section 4352, subsection 2, expiration of a finding of consistency 
43 pursuant to this subsection does not itself make a comprehensive plan inconsistent with the 
44 procedures, goals and guidelines requirements established in this subchapter.1

4 programs.  Subsequent to voluntary certification under this subsection, the municipality or 
5 multimunicipal region shall file a copy of an amendment to a growth management program 
6 with the department within 30 days after adopting the amendment and at least 60 days prior 
7 to applying for any state grant program that offers a preference for consistency or 
8 certification.
95.  Regional councils.  Subject to the availability of funding and pursuant to the 
10 conditions of a contract, each regional council shall review and submit written comments 
11 on the comprehensive plan or growth management program of any municipality or 
12 multimunicipal region within its planning region.  The comments must be submitted to the 
13 department and contain an analysis of:
14 A.  Whether the comprehensive plan or growth management program is compatible 
15 with identified regional policies and needs; and
16 B.  Whether the comprehensive plan or growth management program is compatible 
17 with plans or programs of municipalities or multimunicipal regions that may be 
18 affected by the proposal.
19Sec. 19.  30-A MRSA §5403, sub-§14, as amended by PL 2019, c. 108, §4, is

22 including cluster developments, construct, maintain and operate a sewer system that is 
23 composed of one or more subsurface wastewater collection, treatment and disposal 
24 systems.  The municipality may construct such a sewer system in anticipation of the 
25 establishment of a community sanitary district under Title 38, chapter 11‑A, to which the 
26 municipality will transfer the system pursuant to Title 38, section 1232.  For purposes of 
27 this subsection, "cluster development" has the same meaning as in section 4301, subsection 
28 1‑A; and
29Sec. 20.  38 MRSA §1231, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 556, §4, is repealed.
