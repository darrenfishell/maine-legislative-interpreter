This bill repeals the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Resource Fund (fund) admmistered by the Efficiency Mame 
Trust (EMT) Under current statute, the fund receives revenue fiom alternative compliance payments to the Public 
Utilities Comm1ss10n (PUC) that get transferred to the EMT to be used for vanous energy efficiency projects Instead, 
the bill directs the first $500,000 m revenues from alternative compliance payments to be credited to the Mame 
Energy Resources Development Program (MERD) admimstered by the Governor's Energy Office (GEO) The GEO 
may also request the transfer of addit10nal revenue from alternative compliance payments m excess of the first 
$500,000 if sufficient funds are available Smee revenues from alternative compliance payments have been declmmg, 
it is unlikely that sigmficant revenues will be available for MERD This bill mcludes an Other Special Revenue Funds 
allocation to MERD of $500 startmg m the fiscal year 2023-24 to establish the fund and to allow expenditure of any 
revenue received
