5 2231, subsection 1‑A, paragraph D; or
6Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §2157, sub-§16, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 455, §1 and

9 As used in this subsection, "poultry," "poultry product," "meat" and "meat product" have 
10 the same meanings as in section 2511. ; or
11Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §2157, sub-§17 is enacted to read:
1217.  Grass-fed claims.  If a person sells, offers for sale or distributes within the State 
13 or sells, offers for sale or serves in any retail food establishment or eating establishment as 
14 defined in section 2491, subsection 7 any meat or meat product as defined in section 2511 
15 labeled or advertised as "grass-fed" or by similar designation unless the ruminant animal 
16 was grass-fed.
17 For purposes of this subsection, "grass-fed" means, with respect to meat or a meat product, 
18 that the ruminant animal from which the meat was derived consumed only grass and forage 
19 during its lifetime with the exception of milk consumed prior to its weaning. For purposes 
20 of this subsection, "forage" means the edible parts of plants, other than separated grain, that 
21 provide feed for grazing animals or that can be harvested for feeding.
22 A determination that meat or a meat product is misbranded may be waived by the 
23 commissioner upon application if the commissioner finds a waiver warranted due to 
24 inadvertent exposure of the animal to nonforage feedstuffs or because incidental 
25 supplementation with nonforage feedstuffs was necessary to ensure the well-being of the 
26 animal during adverse environmental or physical conditions.
