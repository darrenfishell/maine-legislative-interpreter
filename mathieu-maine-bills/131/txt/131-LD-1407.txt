Page 1 - 131LR1864(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §2436, sub-§2, as amended by PL 1999, c. 256, Pt. I, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
42.   An insurer may dispute a claim by furnishing to the insured or beneficiary, or a 
5 representative of the insured or beneficiary, a written statement that the claim is disputed 
6 with a statement of the grounds upon which it is disputed.  The statement must be based 
7 upon a reasonable investigation of the claim and must include sufficient detail to permit 
8 the insured or beneficiary to understand and respond to the insurer's position.  For purposes 
9 of this subsection, a claim for payments under a policy or certificate providing health care 
10 coverage is disputed if the insurer, or an administrator that furnishes a provider network to 
11 an insurer, has denied the claim or has requested further information  not previously 
12 submitted that is consistent with Bureau of Insurance Rule Chapter 850.
13Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §2436, sub-§2-A, as repealed and replaced by PL 2009, c. 
14 613, §9, is amended to read:
152-A.   For a claim submitted by a health care provider or health care facility with respect 
16 to a health plan as defined in section 4301‑A, subsection 7, for purposes of this section, 
17 "undisputed claim" means a timely claim for payment of covered health care expenses that 
18 is submitted to a carrier, or an administrator that furnishes a provider network to a carrier, 
19 in conformity with the following requirements.
20 A.  The claim must be submitted on one of the following claims forms:
21 (1)  For a health care facility claim submitted on paper, the standard claim form, 
22 using standards approved by a national uniform billing committee;
23 (2)  For a health care provider claim submitted on paper, the standard claim form, 
24 using standards approved by a national uniform claim committee; and
25 (3)  For health care facility and health care provider claims submitted 
26 electronically, an electronic form using standards approved by an accredited 
27 standards committee of the American National Standards Institute.
28Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §4303, sub-§9, as amended by PL 2021, c. 311, §1, is further 
29 amended to read:
309.  Notice of amendments to provider agreements.  A carrier offering or renewing a 
31 health plan in this State shall notify a participating provider of a proposed amendment to a 
32 provider agreement at least 60 days prior to the amendment's proposed effective date.  If 
33 an amendment that has substantial impact on the rights and obligations of providers is made 
34 to a manual, policy or procedure document referenced in the provider agreement, such as 
35 material changes to fee schedules or material changes to procedural coding rules specified 
36 in the manual, policy or procedure document, the carrier shall provide 60 days' notice to 
37 the provider and an opportunity to object to the amendment.   The notice must include the 
38 carrier's good faith estimate of the total annual financial impact of the amendment on the 
39 aggregate amount of payments made by the carrier to all providers within the State with 
40 whom the carrier has a provider agreement.  After the 60-day notice period has expired  and 
41 in the absence of any objection to the amendment from an affected provider, the 
42 amendment to a manual, policy or procedure document becomes effective and binding on 
43 both the carrier and the provider subject to any applicable termination provisions in the 
Page 2 - 131LR1864(01)44 provider agreement, except that the carrier and provider may mutually agree to waive the 
45 60-day notice requirement.  If a provider objects to an amendment before the expiration of 
46 the 60-day notice period, the amendment to the provider agreement or manual, policy or 
47 procedure document takes effect 18 months from the date the carrier notified the provider, 
48 except that, if there are less than 18 months remaining on the current term and the provider 
49 agreement is not renewable, the amendment may not take effect during the current term of 
50 the provider agreement.  This subsection may not be construed to limit the ability of a 
51 carrier and provider to mutually agree to the proposed change at any time after the provider 
52 has received notice of the proposed amendment.  If the notice required by this subsection 
53 is provided by electronic communication, the subject line of the electronic communication 
54 must indicate that notice of an amendment to a provider agreement or manual, policy or 
55 procedure document is included in the communication and the notice of the amendment 
56 must be provided as an attachment to the communication, as a separate document.  If a 
57 carrier does not comply with this subsection, the superintendent may use any enforcement 
58 authority granted to the superintendent pursuant to this Title.
16Sec. 4.  24-A MRSA §4303, sub-§10, as amended by PL 2007, c. 106, §1, is further 
17 amended to read:
1810.  Limits on retrospective denials.  A carrier offering a health plan in this State may 
19 not impose on any provider any retrospective denial of a previously paid claim or any part 
20 of that previously paid claim unless:
21 A.  The carrier has provided the reason for the retrospective denial in writing to the 
22 provider; and
23 B.  The time that has elapsed since the date of payment of the previously paid claim 
24 does not exceed 12 months.  The retrospective denial of a previously paid claim may 
25 be permitted beyond 12 months but no later than 24 months from the date of payment 
26 only for the following reasons:
27 (1)  The claim was submitted fraudulently;
28 (2)  The claim payment was incorrect incorrectly made because the provider or the 
29 insured was already paid in full for the health care services identified in the claim;
30 (3)  The health care services identified in the claim were not delivered by the 
31 provider;
32 (4)  The claim payment was for services covered by Title XVIII, Title XIX or Title 
33 XXI of the Social Security Act;
34 (5)  The claim payment is the subject of adjustment with another insurer, 
35 administrator or payor; or
36 (6)  The claim payment is the subject of legal action.
37 For purposes of this subsection, "retrospective denial of a previously paid claim" means 
38 any attempt by a carrier to retroactively collect payments already made to a provider with 
39 respect to a claim by requiring repayment of such payments, reducing other payments 
40 currently owed to the provider, withholding or setting off against future payments or 
41 reducing or affecting the reimbursement rates for future claim payments to the provider in 
42 any other manner.  The provider has 6 months from the date of notification under this 
43 subsection to determine whether the insured has other appropriate insurance that was in 1

Page 3 - 131LR1864(01)44 effect on the date of service. Notwithstanding the terms of the provider agreement, the 
45 carrier shall allow for the submission of a claim that was previously denied by another 
46 insurer because of the insured's transfer or termination of coverage.
4SUMMARY
5 This bill amends the Maine Insurance Code in the following ways. 
6 1.  It allows a health care provider to object to a health insurance carrier's material 
7 change to a provider agreement within 60 days of receiving notice of the change and 
8 extends the date on which a change to a provider agreement takes effect based on that 
9 objection.  
10 2.  It requires a health insurance carrier to include an estimate of any adverse financial 
11 impact on a provider as part of a notice of an amendment to a provider agreement. 
12 3.  It clarifies that the requirement for interest to be paid on overdue insurance claims 
13 payments also applies to 3rd-party administrators that furnish provider networks to carriers. 
14 4.  It restricts the authority of a health insurance carrier to retroactively deny a 
15 previously paid claim to no later than 24 months from the date of the claims payment.1
