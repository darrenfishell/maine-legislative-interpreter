36 subdivision of the State, that sustained damages as a result of a violation of subsection 1, 
37 may sue for injury in a civil action under this chapter, including as a class action.  The State

2
Page 3 - 131LR0261(01)39 of subsection 1.  If the court finds for the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to recover 3 times 
40 the amount of the damages sustained and cost of suit and any reasonable attorney's fees.
33. Commencement of action; notice required.  A plaintiff other than the Attorney 
4 General shall provide notice of the commencement of a civil action under this chapter to 
5 the Attorney General at or before the commencement of the action, except that, if the 
6 plaintiff is a political subdivision of the State, notice must be provided to the Attorney 
7 General at least 10 days prior to the commencement of the action.
84. Direct or indirect evidence of dominant position.  In any action brought under this 
9 section, a person's dominant position may be established by:
10 A. Direct evidence, including, but not limited to:
11 (1) The unilateral power of a person to set prices, terms, conditions or standards;
12 (2) The unilateral power of a person to dictate nonprice contractual terms without 
13 compensation;
14 (3) Other evidence that a person is not constrained by meaningful competitive 
15 pressures, such as the ability to degrade quality without suffering reduction in 
16 profitability; or
17 (4) In labor markets, the use of noncompete clauses or so-called no-poach 
18 agreements or the unilateral power to set wages;
19 B. Indirect evidence, including, but not limited to, a person's share of a relevant market; 
20 or
21 C. A combination of direct and indirect evidence.
22 If direct evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that a person has a dominant position or has 
23 abused the dominant position, a court may not require definition of a relevant market in 
24 order to evaluate the evidence, find liability or find that a claim has been stated under this 
25 chapter.
265. Presumption; dominant position.  A person that has a share of 60% or more of a 
27 relevant market as a seller is presumed to have a dominant position in that market.  A person 
28 that has a share of 50% or more of a relevant market as a buyer is presumed to have a 
29 dominant position in that market.
306. Presumption; evidence of abuse of a dominant position.  This subsection governs 
31 evidence establishing an abuse of a dominant position.  
32 A. In any action brought under this section, a person's abuse of a dominant position 
33 may be established by conduct that tends to foreclose or limit the ability or incentive 
34 of one or more actual or potential competitors to compete, such as leveraging a 
35 dominant position in one market to limit competition in a separate market or refusing 
36 to deal with another person with the effect of unnecessarily excluding or handicapping 
37 actual or potential competitors.  In labor markets, abuse of a dominant position may be 
38 established by imposing contracts by which any person is restrained from engaging in 
39 a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind or by restricting the freedom of 
40 workers and independent contractors to disclose wage and benefit information.
41 B. A person with 50 or more employees and $25 million in annual revenues is 
42 presumed to abuse a dominant position if the person:1
2
Page 4 - 131LR0261(01)1 (1)  Engages in conduct that tends to foreclose or limit the ability or incentive of 
2 one or more actual or potential competitors to compete, such as leveraging a 
3 dominant position in one market to limit competition in a separate market, 
4 including bundling, tying, self-preferencing or refusing to interoperate;
5 (2) Refuses to deal with another person with the effect of unnecessarily excluding 
6 or handicapping actual or potential competitors;
7 (3) In labor markets, imposes contracts restraining a person from engaging in a 
8 lawful profession, trade or business or restricting the freedom of workers and 
9 independent contractors to disclose wage and benefit information, including, but 
10 not limited to, noncompete provisions imposed on workers and so-called no-poach 
11 provisions imposed on franchisees or any other would-be competitors in labor 
12 markets;
13 (4) Refuses access to competitors or potential competitors to an essential facility 
14 or resource that is necessary to compete effectively;
15 (5) Buys up a scarce supply of intermediate goods or services required by a 
16 competitor;
17 (6) Refuses to supply scarce goods or services to a competitor or consumer;
18 (7) Imposes antisteering provisions or most favored nation provisions on input 
19 providers with the goal of preventing suppliers from offering their consumers a 
20 lower price at a rival distributor;
21 (8) Imposes exclusivity on suppliers or consumers as a condition of doing business; 
22 or
23 (9) Engages in predatory tactics, such as pricing a good or service below 
24 incremental costs.
257. Defenses.  Evidence of procompetitive effects is not a defense to abuse of dominance 
26 and does not offset or cure competitive harm.
278. Duplicate liability.  In any action in which claims are asserted against a defendant 
28 by both direct and indirect purchasers, the court shall take all steps necessary to avoid 
29 duplicate liability, including, but not limited to, the transfer and consolidation of all related 
30 actions.
319. Rules.  The Attorney General may adopt rules to implement this chapter, including, 
32 but not limited to, the Attorney General's interpretation of market share and other relevant 
33 market conditions while taking into account the role of small and medium-sized businesses 
34 in the State's economy.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical 
35 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
3610. Construction.  This chapter may not be construed to:
37 A. Limit the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission; or
38 B. Limit the rights of employees or independent contractors to combine in unions, 
39 organizations or associations, to establish or maintain union apprenticeship or training 
40 programs or to bargain collectively concerning wages and the terms and conditions of 
41 employment.
42§1120-L.  Exceptions
Page 5 - 131LR0261(01)1 This section governs exceptions to the abuse of dominance right of action.
21. Exceptions.  Nothing in this chapter applies to the following:

4 livestock farmers and fruit growers;
5 B. Contracts, agreements or arrangements made by the industries described in

9 copyrighted, including, but not limited to, a streaming series, television program or 
10 motion picture.

13 conduct of any business, trade or commerce, in any labor market or in the furnishing of any 
14 service in this State that abuses that dominant position.  The bill requires any person 
15 conducting certain types of business in this State that is required to file a notification and 
16 report form prior to a merger pursuant to federal law to provide the same notification and 
17 report to the Attorney General.  It establishes a penalty for failing to file the required notice.  
18 The bill increases the cap on monetary penalties from $10,000 to $50,000 for violations of 
19 provisions of law relating to the acquisition of gasoline and heating oil assets and increases

23 relief in proceedings related to antitrust violations.12
