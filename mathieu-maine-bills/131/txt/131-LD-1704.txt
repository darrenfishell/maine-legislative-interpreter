8 must be counted for apportionment under this chapter as follows.
9 A.  If the records of the Department of Corrections show the person has a residence 
10 address in this State immediately prior to incarceration, that address must be considered

12 B.  If the records of the Department of Corrections do not show the person's residence 
13 address immediately prior to incarceration, or show a residence address immediately 
14 prior to incarceration that is not within this State, that person may not be counted for

163.  Department of Corrections to provide data.  Notwithstanding any provision of 
17 law respecting confidentiality to the contrary, the Department of Corrections shall provide 
18 to the Legislative Apportionment Commission the preincarceration residence address and 
19 other demographic data of persons who are incarcerated as of 12:01 a.m. on the date of the

26 safekeeping upon conclusion of the commission's work.
274.  Construction.  This section may not be construed to affect the population count in 
28 any geographical area for any purposes other than apportionment.
