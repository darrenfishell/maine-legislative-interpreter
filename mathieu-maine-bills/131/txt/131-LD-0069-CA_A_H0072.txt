undertake to better educate electric consumers on their electric energy supply and the 
factors that cause fluctuations in the cost of that supply. It also requires the commission to 
identify and examine methods to calculate the levelized cost of electricity for each power 
source that may be used in supplying energy to residential and small nonresidential 
consumers. It requires, by February 10, 2024, the commission to submit a report, and it 
allows the committee to report out a bill to the 131st Legislature in 2024.
