Page 1 - 131LR2046(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA c. 38 is enacted to read:
3CHAPTER 38
4BENEFICIAL ELECTRIFICATION POLICY ACT
5§3801. Short title
6 This chapter may be known and cited as "the Beneficial Electrification Policy Act."
7§3802. Policy of beneficial electrification
8 The policy of beneficial electrification is the use or adoption of technologies and 
9 processes to power consumer end uses with electricity in a manner that will lower overall 
10 energy costs for consumers and lower emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, 
11 without negatively impacting grid reliability, as determined by the commission. If a policy 
12 or decision has the effect of increasing electricity rates over the life of measures enacted 
13 by the policy or decision that would otherwise be considered beneficial electrification, that 
14 policy or decision is presumed to be not consistent with the policy of beneficial 
15 electrification unless the commission determines that the policy or decision is necessary 
16 and prudent with respect to the beneficial electrification and the State's economy.
17§3803. Support for the policy of beneficial electrification
18 The State shall support the policy of beneficial electrification pursuant to this section.
191.  Consideration of policy.  The commission shall consider the policy of beneficial 
20 electrification in regulating utilities subject to this Title and in meeting greenhouse gas 
21 reduction goals under Title 38, section 576-A.
222.  Beneficial electrification.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 
23 the commission shall develop and implement a multi-year plan to promote beneficial 
24 electrification.  The plan may include phasing in procurement of renewable generation of 
25 energy to accommodate growth in the electric load.  The Efficiency Maine Trust shall 
26 develop a 3-year beneficial electrification plan as part of the trust's triennial plan or a 
27 standalone plan to facilitate the implementation of the policy of beneficial electrification.  
28 The commission shall incorporate the trust's plan into the multi-year plan.  The commission 
29 may use money from any source to implement the plan established under this subsection.  
30 The commission shall propose and approve surcharges on energy production, distribution 
31 or consumption that the commission determines are necessary for the cost-effective 
32 implementation of beneficial electrification consistent with the plans.  The commission 
33 may transfer money or order money to be paid directly to the trust or other state agencies 
34 to implement the plans and shall require annual reporting of money requests, transfers and 
35 expenditures.
363.  Monitoring beneficial electrification trends and opportunities.  To the extent 
37 possible through readily available information, the commission and the Efficiency Maine 
38 Trust shall coordinate to monitor:
39 A.  The level of beneficial electrification activity in relation to the cost-effective 
40 developments, policies and programs in section 3804;
Page 2 - 131LR2046(01)1 B.  Basic trends in beneficial electrification; and 
2 C.  The likely relative costs and benefits for ratepayers from implementation of various 
3 beneficial electrification programs and opportunities.
44.  Coordination between agencies.  Within existing programs and resources, the 
5 Small Enterprise Growth Program, as established in Title 10, chapter 13; the Maine 
6 Technology Institute, as established in Title 5, section 12004-G, subsection 33-D; the 
7 Maine Rural Development Authority, as established in Title 5, section 12004-F, subsection 
8 18; the Finance Authority of Maine, as established in Title 10, chapter 110; and the 
9 Department of Economic and Community Development shall coordinate with the 
10 commission and the Efficiency Maine Trust to seek opportunities to promote investment 
11 in the adoption and development of beneficial electrification.
125.  Supplier consolidated billing.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the 
13 contrary, the commission shall adopt rules that require the standard-offer service providers 
14 under section 3212 and competitive electricity providers to offer and allow residential 
15 electricity consumers to elect supplier consolidated billing for retail electricity service. The 
16 commission shall adopt rules to encourage providers to provide electricity supply options 
17 to allow consumers choice in time of use rates for electricity supply and otherwise 
18 personalize consumer energy consumption. For purposes of this subsection, "supplier 
19 consolidated billing" means a practice through which a competitive electricity provider 
20 calculates and issues bills for transmission and distribution service and electric supply upon 
21 request of a consumer and with the agreement of the competitive electricity provider.  
22§3804. Cost-effective developments, policies and programs
23 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the commission shall pursue 
24 cost-effective developments, policies and programs that implement the policy of beneficial 
25 electrification to meaningfully contribute to reducing the State's dependence on imported 
26 energy sources, provide economic and climate benefits for all ratepayers regardless of 
27 income level, adapt the procurement of energy generation consistent with the policy of 
28 beneficial electrification and implement consumer financing systems that support greater 
29 consumer choice for beneficial electrification applications while ensuring consumer 
30 protections and empowering energy consumers.  To the extent practicable, the commission 
31 shall balance the acquisition of renewable electricity with the reasonably expected 
32 increased use of renewable electricity by retail electricity consumers.
33§3805. Reporting
34 The commission shall include a summary of its activities with regard to beneficial 
35 electrification in its annual report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
36 jurisdiction over energy matters.
37§3806. Rules
38 The commission shall adopt rules to implement this chapter. Rules adopted pursuant 
39 to this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.

12 the lawful purposes of the trust.  The trust shall perform any action assigned to the trust by 
13 the commission to implement the policy of beneficial electrification described by chapter 
14 38.
15Sec. 6.  Study; report required.  The Public Utilities Commission shall conduct a 
16 study on how to most cost-effectively provide consumer financing of beneficial 
17 electrification products, including items for energy efficiency, home or business energy 
18 storage, electric vehicle charging equipment and other distributed energy products through 
19 the Efficiency Maine Trust or through on-bill financing by standard-offer service providers 
20 or competitive electricity providers.  No later than December 6, 2023, the Public Utilities 
21 Commission shall submit to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and 
22 Technology a report on implementing supplier consolidated billing to support beneficial 
23 electrification as required by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3803, 
24 subsection 5 and the study on consumer financing required by this section.
25SUMMARY
