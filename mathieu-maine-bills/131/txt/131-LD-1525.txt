3SUBCHAPTER 5
4ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSION
5ยง10621.  Administrative suspension without criminal conviction or civil adjudication
6 The commissioner may suspend a license or certificate issued under this Part for a 
7 violation of the inland fisheries and wildlife laws.
81.  Initiation and notice.  If the Game Warden Colonel delivers to the commissioner 
9 a written statement under oath that the Game Warden Colonel has probable cause to suspect 
10 that a violation of the inland fisheries and wildlife laws has been committed, the 
11 commissioner shall immediately examine the affidavit and determine if a suspension is 
12 necessary.  If the commissioner determines based on a preponderance of the evidence that 
13 a suspension is necessary, the commissioner shall immediately notify in writing the person 
14 who violated the law or engaged in the conduct.  The notice must state that there is an 
15 opportunity for a hearing, if the person requests the hearing in writing within 10 days of 
16 the notice.  The notice is deemed received 3 days after the mailing.  The commissioner may 
17 suspend the license or certificate of a person who has been notified pursuant to this 
18 subsection but who does not request a hearing within the allowed time.
192.  Hearing.  A hearing requested under subsection 1 must be held within 30 business 
20 days after receipt by the commissioner of a request for hearing except that a hearing may 
21 be held more than 30 business days after the request if the delay is requested by the person 
22 requesting the hearing.  If the hearing is continued, it must be held no later than 60 days 
23 after the original notice, and any further continuance must be with the consent of both 
24 parties.  The hearing must be held in accordance with the Maine Administrative Procedure 
25 Act, except that:
26 A.  Notwithstanding Title 5, section 9057, issues of the hearing are limited to whether 
27 the person requesting the hearing had a license or certificate and whether that person 
28 committed a violation of the inland fisheries and wildlife laws; and
29 B.  Notwithstanding Title 5, section 9061, the decision of the presiding officer under 
30 Title 5, section 9062 must be made not more than 10 business days after completion of 
31 the hearing.
32 If the presiding officer of the hearing finds that a violation of the inland fisheries and 
33 wildlife laws has been committed, the presiding officer shall immediately notify the 
34 commissioner of the finding.
353.  Finding of violation and suspension.  The commissioner may suspend the license 
36 or certificate of the person requesting the hearing under subsection 2 if the presiding officer 
37 of the hearing finds that a violation of the inland fisheries and wildlife laws has been 
38 committed.  The commissioner may suspend any license or certificate for a period of time 
39 not to exceed the maximum amount of time allowable for a criminal conviction or civil 
40 adjudication of the same violation.
Page 2 - 131LR2025(01)14.  Prohibition against multiple suspensions.  If the commissioner suspends a license 
2 or certificate under this section, the commissioner may not suspend the license or certificate 
3 because of a criminal conviction or civil adjudication for the same violation.
45.  Appeal.  A decision of the commissioner to suspend a license or certificate pursuant 
5 to this section may be appealed to the Superior Court if it is filed with the court within 30 
6 days of the decision.
76.  Request for hearing on suspension length; place of hearing.  The license or 
8 certificate holder may request a hearing regarding the length of suspension under this 
9 section.  A hearing must be requested in writing within 10 days from the effective date of 
10 the suspension.  The hearing must be held within 10 days of the request unless a longer 
11 period of time is mutually agreed to in writing.  The hearing must be conducted in the 
12 Augusta area.
13SUMMARY
14 This bill creates an administrative license suspension process for the Department of 
15 Inland Fisheries and Wildlife similar to what exists for the Department of Marine 
16 Resources.
17 The process allows the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to determine if 
18 license suspension is necessary without criminal conviction or civil adjudication upon 
19 recommendation of the Game Warden Colonel when a violation of inland fisheries and 
20 wildlife laws has been committed. This determination is to be based on a preponderance of 
21 the evidence.
22 The commissioner must notify the individual in writing of the pending suspension and 
23 include instructions for requesting a hearing. If requested, a hearing must be held within 30 
24 days of the commissioner receiving the request, except if a delay is requested by the 
25 individual, in which case the hearing must be held no later than 60 days from receiving the 
26 request, except by mutual agreement between the individual and the commissioner. 
27 The commissioner may suspend any license or certificate for a period of time not to 
28 exceed the maximum amount of time allowable for a criminal conviction or civil 
29 adjudication of the same violation.  A decision of the commissioner to suspend a license or 
30 certificate pursuant to this section may be appealed to the Superior Court within 30 days of 
31 the decision.  If the commissioner suspends a license under this section, the commissioner 
32 may not suspend or extend the suspension of the license because of a criminal conviction 
33 or civil adjudication for the same violation.14
