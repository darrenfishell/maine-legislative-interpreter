Page 1 - 131LR1822(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §6602, sub-§12, as amended by PL 2021, c. 426, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
412.  Local Foods Fund.  The Local Foods Fund is established within the department.  
5 The fund is authorized to receive revenue from public and private sources.  The fund must 
6 be held separate and apart from all other money, funds and accounts.  Any balance 
7 remaining in the fund at the end of the fiscal year must be carried forward to the next fiscal 
8 year.  The fund must be used to match $1 for every $3 a school administrative unit pays for 
9 produce, value-added dairy, protein or minimally processed foods purchased directly from 
10 a farmer, farmers' cooperative, local food hub, local food processor or food service 
11 distributor in the State, to a maximum state contribution of $5,000 per school administrative 
12 unit in fiscal year 2021‑22 and subsequent years or $5,500 per school administrative unit 
13 if funding is received and the school administrative unit sends a food service employee to 
14 local foods training administered by the department under subsection 13.  All foods 
15 purchased using the fund must be grown or produced in the State, with the exception of 
16 processed and value-added food products produced in the State, which must meet standards 
17 set by the department.  The department shall create standards for allowable processed and 
18 value-added food products produced in the State and provide guidance to school 
19 administrative units regarding which of those products are allowable for reimbursement 
20 under this subsection and subsection 12-A.  At the end of the fiscal year, the school 
21 administrative unit may provide the department with receipts documenting purchases 
22 pursuant to this subsection during that year.  For purposes of this subsection, "minimally 
23 processed" means only the washing, cleaning, trimming, peeling, slicing, drying, sorting, 
24 refrigerating, freezing and packaging of food items or a combination of those activities.  
25 Reimbursement or partial reimbursement to school administrative units may only be made 
26 up to the amount available in the fund.  Failure to reimburse does not constitute an 
27 obligation on behalf of the State to a school administrative unit.  The department shall apply 
28 for federal grant funding to provide state contributions in excess of $5,000 per school 
29 administrative unit in fiscal year 2021-22 and subsequent years pursuant to this subsection 
30 if applicable grant funding is available.  The department may accept grant funding from 
31 hospitals and other sources to provide state contributions in excess of $5,000 per school 
32 administrative unit in fiscal year 2021-22 and subsequent years pursuant to this subsection.
33SUMMARY
34 Current law provides that all foods purchased using the Local Foods Fund established 
35 within the Department of Education must be grown or produced in the State. It provides 
36 that other than produce, value-added dairy or protein, food purchased must be minimally 
37 processed and defines what "minimally processed" means. This bill removes reference to 
38 minimally processed foods and the definition. It allows the fund to be used to purchase 
39 processed and value-added food products produced in the State, which must meet standards 
40 set by the Department of Education. The department is directed to create standards for 
41 allowable processed and value-added Maine foods and provide guidance to school 
42 administrative units regarding which of those products are allowable for reimbursement.34
