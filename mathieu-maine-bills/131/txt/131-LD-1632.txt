3 read:
4§3821.  Transportation and storage of forensic examination kits
5 For the purposes of this section, "sexual assault" means any crime enumerated in Title 
6 17‑A, chapter 11 and "strangulation" has the same meaning as in Title 17-A, section 208, 
7 subsection 1, paragraph C.
8 If an alleged victim of sexual assault or strangulation has a forensic examination and 
9 has not reported the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency when the examination is 
10 complete, the licensed hospital or licensed health care practitioner that completed the 
11 forensic examination shall notify the nearest law enforcement agency.  That law 
12 enforcement agency shall transport the completed forensic examination kit, identified only 
13 by a tracking number assigned by the kit manufacturer, to its evidence storage facility.  The 
14 law enforcement agency shall store the forensic examination kit  kits involving sexual 
15 assault for  8 12 years  and forensic examination kits involving only strangulation for 6 years.  
16 If during that storage period the alleged victim reports the offense to a law enforcement 
17 agency, the investigating agency shall take possession of the forensic examination kit.
18 In the case of a forensic examination performed under Title 24, section 2986, 
19 subsection 5, the law enforcement agency must immediately notify the district attorney for 
20 the district in which the hospital or health care practitioner is located that such a forensic 
21 examination has been performed and a forensic examination kit has been completed under 
22 Title 24, section 2986, subsection 5.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill directs a law enforcement agency to collect and transport anonymously 
25 collected forensic evidence from strangulation exams. The bill changes the required time 
26 that a law enforcement agency must store a forensic examination kit for sexual assault from 
27 8 years to 12 years and requires that a law enforcement agency store a forensic examination 
28 kit involving only strangulation for 6 years. 24
