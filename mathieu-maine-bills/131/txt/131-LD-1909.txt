28 program.  
29 B.  By July 15, 2024, the cooperative shall submit a plan for the operation of the 
30 program to the department for review and approval. The plan must include, but is not 
31 limited to:
32 (1)  The method by which the program will facilitate the transition from beverage 
33 container sorting at redemption centers by brand to sorting by material type and, 
34 for redemption centers that manually sort containers, by size within each material 
35 type.  The program may facilitate the negotiation of agreements with redemption 
36 centers to gather brand data through use of reverse vending machines, account-
37 based bulk processing programs or similar technology as long as the cost of such 
38 data collection is paid by the program; 
39 (2)  Standards to provide for fair apportionment of costs among the commingling 
40 groups included in the program, which may be based on:
41 (a)  The combined beverage container sales by the initiators of deposit that are 
42 members of each commingling group; or
Page 9 - 131LR1418(01)1 (b)  The unit or brand counts generated by reverse vending machines or 
2 account-based bulk processing programs as long as the reverse vending 
3 machines or account-based bulk processing programs are subject to periodic 
4 3rd-party audits on a schedule approved by the department and with the costs 
5 of those audits paid by the program;  
6 (3)  A method for determining the rate of redemption for beverage containers, 
7 expressed as a percentage of the beverage containers redeemed that are available 
8 for redemption; the variation in the rate of redemption between beverage type or 
9 beverage container type; and the difference in the rate of redemption by county or 
10 other geographic division of the State.  The method for determining the redemption 
11 rate may not include in its calculation any unredeemed beverage containers 
12 collected or processed by municipal or other recycling programs.  The program 
13 must ensure that a single redemption rate, determined by the method specified in 
14 the plan, is used by all commingling groups and initiators of deposit to determine 
15 cost apportionment pursuant to subparagraph (2);
16 (4)  A budget for the program that includes, but is not limited to, identification of 
17 any start-up costs for the program that will not be ongoing, including, but not 
18 limited to, the costs of the study described in paragraph F, and a description of the 
19 method by which the cooperative will determine and collect payments from 
20 commingling groups to cover the program's start-up costs;
21 (5)  The method by which the cooperative will collect deposits from initiators of 
22 deposit for nonrefillable beverage containers and handling fees for redeemed 
23 containers, whether directly from the initiator of deposit or through the 
24 commingling group of which the initiator of deposit is a member.  The program 
25 must ensure that an initiator of deposit is not required to pay any handling fees for 
26 its beverage containers that exceeds the applicable redemption rate for those 
27 containers as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (3);
28 (6)  A description of how the cooperative intends to maintain and expend 
29 unclaimed beverage container deposits in accordance with section 3108-A;
30 (7)  A description of how the cooperative will provide the department with a 
31 proposed beverage container pick-up schedule for each redemption center that is 
32 designed to ensure that the pick-up requirements of section 3106, subsection 8 are 
33 met and will notify the department of any contractual agreements regarding 
34 container pickup between the cooperative and a redemption center as provided in 
35 section 3106, subsection 8.  
36 (a)  The program must ensure that pick-up schedules are designed to reduce 
37 transportation distances and minimize costs but must allow each commingling 
38 group to contract with a pick-up agent to provide for beverage container pickup 
39 of the commingling group's equivalent container material.
40 (b)  The program must ensure that, if the cooperative is informed by a 
41 commingling group that a pick-up schedule for a redemption center cannot be 
42 met, which would result in a violation of section 3106, subsection 8, the 
43 cooperative notifies the department in writing prior to the occurrence of such 
44 a violation;
Page 10 - 131LR1418(01)1 (8)  Information on how the cooperative will be responsible for and ensure payment

13 beverage containers redeemed, collected and processed for recycling under the 
14 program;
15 (10)  Information on how the cooperative will calculate the base rates offered for

17 program or pick-up agents;
18 (11)  A certification that the cooperative will not share, except with the department 
19 as necessary, information provided by a commingling group or initiator of deposit 
20 that is proprietary information and that is identified by the commingling group or 
21 initiator of deposit as proprietary information.  The certification must include a 
22 description of the methods by which the cooperative intends to ensure the 
23 confidentiality of that information;
24 (12)  Information on how the cooperative will maintain a publicly accessible 
25 website regarding the program that includes, at a minimum, the following:

20 of deposit that are members of each of the commingling groups included in the 
21 cooperative are deemed to be in violation of this chapter and are subject to penalties 
22 pursuant to section 3111.
23 D.  If the department determines that the program implemented by the cooperative 
24 pursuant to a plan approved under paragraph C has failed to make adequate progress 
25 toward fulfilling the requirements of the plan, the department shall notify the 
26 cooperative in writing of its determination and may direct the cooperative to implement
