16 When an appointing authority selects an individual for membership on the commission, the 
17 appointing authority shall make reasonable efforts to appoint members that reflect the 
18 diversity of the State's racial and gender demographics and qualified members of a 
19 protected class as defined in Title 5, section 4553, subsection 8-F. For purposes of this 
20 subsection, "restorative justice" means the rehabilitation of a criminal offender through 
21 reconciliation with victims and the community at large.
223.  Chair; terms; vacancy; reappointment; other officers; quorum; 
23reimbursement.  The commission shall select one of its members to serve as chair of the 
24 commission. Members of the commission are appointed for 3-year terms. Each member 
25 continues in office until a successor is duly appointed. A vacancy on the commission must 
26 be filled in the same manner as the original appointment was made under subsection 2. 
27 Members are eligible for reappointment. The commission may elect any additional officers 
28 necessary for the efficient discharge of the commission's duties. A quorum of the

355.  Sentencing guidelines advisory; do not create right; public policy.  The

37 guidelines when sentencing a defendant, but a court shall follow the procedures of the 
38 sentencing guidelines when pronouncing a sentence in a proceeding to which the 
39 sentencing guidelines apply by operation of statute. Sentencing pursuant to the sentencing 
40 guidelines is not a right that accrues to a defendant. The sentencing guidelines are a 
41 procedure based on state public policy to maintain uniformity, proportionality, rationality 
42 and predictability in sentencing similarly situated persons for similar crimes.
Page 3 - 131LR0040(01)16.  Development and modification of sentencing guidelines.  The commission shall 
2 develop sentencing guidelines to provide guidance to a court. In establishing and modifying 
3 the sentencing guidelines, the primary considerations of the commission are public safety 
4 and equal application of sentences under the law. The commission shall also consider 
5 current sentencing and release practices, correctional resources, including the capacities of 
6 state and local correctional facilities, and the long-term negative impact of the crime on the 
7 community. The sentencing guidelines must be based on reasonable offense and offender 
8 characteristics for murder and Class A, B and C crimes. The sentencing guidelines adopted 
9 by the commission must establish:
10 A.  The circumstances under which imprisonment of an offender is proper; and
11 B.  Appropriate sanctions for offenders for whom imprisonment is not proper, making 
12 specific reference to noninstitutional sanctions, including payment of fines, restitution, 
13 community service, work release programs, community-based residential and 
14 nonresidential programs, incarceration in a local correctional facility and probation.
157.  Clearinghouse and information center.  The commission shall serve as a 
16 clearinghouse and information center for the collection, preparation, analysis and 
17 dissemination of information on state and local sentencing practices and conduct ongoing 
18 research regarding sentencing guidelines, use of imprisonment and alternatives to 
19 imprisonment, plea bargaining and other matters relating to the improvement of the 
20 criminal justice system. The commission shall from time to time make recommendations 
21 to the Legislature regarding changes in the Maine Criminal Code, criminal procedures and 
22 other aspects of sentencing, including information regarding the impact of statutory 
23 changes to the State's criminal laws related to controlled substances.
248.  Study.  After the implementation of the sentencing guidelines, the commission shall 
25 periodically study at least every 2 years the impact of the sentencing guidelines and review 
26 the powers and duties of the Commissioner of Corrections.
279.  Administrative support; voluntary and uncompensated services; ability to 
28enter contracts; request information.  The judiciary shall provide adequate office space, 
29 resources and administrative support for the commission. The commission may also utilize 
30 the services, equipment, personnel, information and resources of another state agency with 
31 the consent of the agency and may accept voluntary and uncompensated services, contract 
32 with individuals and public and private agencies and request information, reports and data 
33 from any agency of the State or any of its political subdivisions to the extent authorized by 
34 law.
3510.  Funds acceptance; borrowing prohibited.  If the Federal Government or a 
36 person, corporation or any other entity offers funds to the commission to carry out the 
37 commission's purposes and duties, the commission may accept the offer by majority vote 
38 of its membership and upon acceptance the chair shall receive the funds subject to the terms 
39 of the offer. Funds may not be accepted or received as a loan and the commission may not 
40 incur any indebtedness except in the manner and under the limitations otherwise provided 
41 by law.
4211.  Research director; other staffing.  The commission may select and employ a 
43 research director to perform the duties the commission directs, including the hiring of any 
44 clerical help and other employees who the commission approves. The research director 
45 position and compensation is in the unclassified service of the State under Title 5, chapter 
Page 4 - 131LR0040(01)46 71. The position and compensation of another staff member is pursuant to Title 5, chapter 
47 372.
312.  Modification.  The commission shall meet as necessary, but at least 2 times per 
4 year, for the purpose of modifying and improving the sentencing guidelines. Any 
5 modification of the sentencing guidelines regarding severity levels and offender 
6 characteristics or that results in the reduction of any sentence or in the early release of any 
7 inmate, with the exception of a modification mandated or authorized by the Legislature or 
8 relating to a crime created or amended by the Legislature in the preceding session, must be 
9 submitted to the Legislature by January 15th of the year in which the commission wishes 
10 to make the change. All other modifications take effect according to the procedures of the 
11 commission under subsection 4. On or before January 15th of each year, the commission 
12 shall submit a written report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
13 jurisdiction over judicial matters that identifies and explains all modifications made during 
14 the preceding 12 months and all proposed modifications that are being submitted to the 
15 Legislature that year.
1613.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to implement the sentencing guidelines. 
17 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules under Title 5, chapter 
18 375, subchapter 2-A.
19Sec. 4.  Submission of sentencing guidelines.  By November 6, 2024, the Maine 
20 Sentencing Guidelines Commission, established by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, 
21 section 12004-I, subsection 52-D, shall submit the sentencing guidelines, developed 
22 pursuant to Title 17-A, section 1505, subsection 6, to the joint standing committee of the 
23 Legislature having jurisdiction over judicial matters. 
24SUMMARY
25 This bill establishes the Maine Sentencing Guidelines Commission to develop, adopt 
26 and modify sentencing guidelines for murder and Class A, B and C crimes to maintain 
27 uniformity, proportionality, rationality and predictability in sentencing similarly situated 
28 persons for similar crimes. The commission consists of 19 members including the Chief 
29 Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court or the Chief Justice's designee and other members of 
30 the judiciary, the Commissioner of Corrections or the commissioner's designee, the 
31 Commissioner of Public Safety or the commissioner's designee, prosecuting and defense 
32 attorneys, a probation and parole officer, 3 members of the public, one of whom is a victim 
33 of a Class A, B or C crime, experts in mental health issues and substance use disorder, 
34 formerly incarcerated persons and representatives of statewide organizations focusing on 
35 legal aid, restorative justice and civil rights.  The sentencing guidelines are advisory and 
36 do not create a right for the defendant.  If the commission determines it is necessary to 
37 modify a guideline that results in the reduction of any sentence or in the early release of 
38 any inmate, the commission is required to notify the Legislature. The commission also 
39 serves as a clearinghouse and information center for the collection, preparation, analysis 
40 and dissemination of information on state and local sentencing practices and conducts 
41 ongoing research regarding sentencing guidelines, use of imprisonment and alternatives to 
42 imprisonment, plea bargaining and other matters relating to the improvement of the 
43 criminal justice system.1
