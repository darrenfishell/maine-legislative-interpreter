8 or carbon dioxide equivalents per kilogram of hydrogen generated, as determined by 
9 the commission in accordance with IRS production tax credit regulations.
10 B. "Clean hydrogen facility" means a facility that produces clean hydrogen, has a peak 
11 electricity demand that is no more than 20 megawatts and meets applicable 
12 requirements for a federal production tax credit under the federal act and IRS 
13 production tax credit regulations.
14 C. "Federal act" means the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Public Law 117-169, 136
