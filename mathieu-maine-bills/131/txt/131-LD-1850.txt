Page 1 - 131LR0400(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3145, as amended by PL 2021, c. 676, Pt. A, §49, is further 
3 amended to read:
4§3145.  State energy storage policy goals
5 The state goal for energy storage system development is at least 300 megawatts of 
6 installed capacity located within the State by December 31, 2025 and at least 400 
7 megawatts of installed capacity located within the State by December 31, 2030.  Beginning 
8 January 1, 2031  2024, and every 2 years thereafter, the Governor's Energy Office 
9 established in Title 2, section 9 shall set may reevaluate and increase the state goal for 
10 energy storage system development and report that goal to the joint standing committee of 
11 the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and utilities matters.  For the purposes of 
12 this section, "energy storage system" has the same meaning as in section 3481, subsection 
13 6.
14Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3204, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 316, §3, is amended 
15 to read:
166.  Generation assets permitted.  On or after March 1, 2000, notwithstanding any 
17 other provision in this chapter, the commission may allow an investor-owned transmission 
18 and distribution utility to own, have a financial interest in or otherwise control generation 
19 and generation-related assets to the extent that the commission finds that ownership, 
20 interest or control is necessary for the utility to perform its obligations as a transmission 
21 and distribution utility in an efficient manner.
22 The commission shall by rule establish conditions under which an investor-owned 
23 transmission and distribution utility may own, have a financial interest in or otherwise 
24 control energy storage systems, as defined in section 3481, subsection 6, in order to perform 
25 its obligations as a transmission and distribution utility in an efficient manner.  Rules 
26 adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, 
27 subchapter 2-A.
28Sec. 3.  Maine energy storage program development.  The Governor's Energy 
29 Office, established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 2, section 9, referred to in this 
30 section as "the office," shall, in consultation with the Public Utilities Commission, evaluate 
31 designs for a program to procure commercially available utility-scale energy storage 
32 systems connected to the transmission and distribution systems, including, but not limited 
33 to, through the use of an index storage credit mechanism. 
34 1. In evaluating programs for the procurement of energy storage systems, the office 
35 shall consider programs that are likely to be cost-effective for ratepayers and that are likely 
36 to achieve the following objectives:
37 A. Advance both the State's climate and clean energy goals and the state energy storage 
38 policy goals established in Title 35-A, section 3145 through the development of up to 
39 200 megawatts of incremental energy storage capacity located in the State;
40 B. Provide one or more net benefits to the electric grid and to ratepayers, including, but 
41 not limited to, improved reliability, improved resiliency and incremental delivery of 
42 renewable electricity to customers;
43 C. Maximize the value of federal incentives; and
Page 2 - 131LR0400(01)1 D. Enable the highest value energy storage projects, specifically energy storage 
2 systems in preferred locations, projects that can serve as an alternative to upgrades of 
3 the existing transmission system and projects of optimal duration.
4 For purposes of this subsection, "index storage credit mechanism" means a mechanism for 
5 setting contract prices for energy storage capacity using the difference between a 
6 competitively bid price, or strike price, and daily reference prices calculated using an index 
7 designed to approximate wholesale market revenues available for each megawatt-hour of 
8 capacity and including a mechanism to provide for a net payment from the operator of the 
9 storage capacity project to ratepayers in the event the reference price exceeds the strike 
10 price. 
11 2. The office shall encourage interested parties to submit relevant information to inform 
12 the evaluation under subsection 1.
13 3. No later than March 31, 2024, the office shall complete the evaluation required under 
14 subsection 1 and provide its recommendations to the Public Utilities Commission for a 
15 program to procure up to 200 megawatts of energy storage capacity. 
16 4. No later than December 31, 2024, the Public Utilities Commission shall review the 
17 recommendations of the report and determine whether the program recommended by the 
18 office is reasonably likely to achieve the objectives established in subsection 1.  Upon 
19 finding the proposed program reasonably likely to achieve the objectives established in 
20 subsection 1, the Public Utilities Commission shall take steps to implement the program in 
21 accordance with any applicable authority the commission may have under law and may 
22 submit to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy 
23 matters recommendations for any changes to law needed to allow the commission to fully 
24 implement the program. The joint standing committee may report out legislation related to 
25 energy storage to the 132nd Legislature in 2025.
26Sec. 4.  Governor's Energy Office; long-duration energy storage report. The 
27 Governor's Energy Office shall study long-duration energy storage, including opportunities 
28 for new and emerging long-duration energy storage technology that would support the 
29 State's need for clean, firm power generation in support of the State's climate and clean 
30 energy goals.  The office shall submit a report, along with any recommendations, to the 
31 Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology no later than February 1, 
32 2024. The joint standing committee may report out a bill related to the report to the Second 
33 Regular Session of the 131st Legislature. The report must include, but is not limited to:
34 1.  A discussion of technology options for long-duration energy storage, including 
35 emerging technologies and a description of their technical operation and commercial 
36 viability, that may be feasible within the State and New England between 2023 and 2040;
37 2.  An overview of known cost and performance characteristics, as well as development 
38 considerations by technology, such as development timelines, siting requirements or safety 
39 considerations; and
40 3.  A discussion of scenarios for long-duration energy storage technologies, such as 
41 serving as peaking capacity, providing winter reliability or providing benefits through 
42 colocation with renewable resources.
Page 3 - 131LR0400(01)1Sec. 5.  Funding. Upon written request of the Governor's Energy Office, for the 
2 purposes of allowing the office to fulfill its responsibilities under sections 2 and 3, the

7 staff and consultants in an amount not to exceed $300,000 from the Public Utilities 
8 Commission Regulatory Fund established under Title 35-A, section 116.
9Sec. 6.  Public Utilities Commission; utility ownership or control of energy 
10storage. The Public Utilities Commission shall conduct a rule-making proceeding under 
11 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3204, subsection 6 to establish the 
12 conditions under which an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility may own, 
13 have a financial interest in or otherwise control energy storage systems in order to perform 
14 its obligations as a transmission and distribution utility in an efficient manner.
15 1.  In the rule-making process, the commission shall consider at a minimum the effect 
16 that investor-owned transmission and distribution utility ownership of, financial interest in 
17 or control of energy storage systems may have in:
18 A.  The achievement of the state energy storage goals established in Title 35-A, section 
19 3145, including current and future state programs to encourage investment in energy 
20 storage;
21 B.  The achievement of the objectives of Title 35-A, chapter 32;
