2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA ยง6030-H is enacted to read:
3ยง6030-H.  Screening services
41.  Definition.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A.  "Screening service" means a service that assesses the eligibility of potential tenants 
7 for a rental property by allowing an owner of rental property or a rental property 
8 manager to check the background of the applying tenant, including a credit check.
92.  Screening service report.  Except as provided by subsection 4, a prospective tenant 
10 may use a screening service report in applying for the rental of a residence.  The report 
11 must include the date the report is issued. The prospective tenant may use the report for 
12 multiple applications within 30 days from the date the report is issued.  A report is not valid 
13 for use in an application for the rental of a residence after the 30th day after the date the 
14 report is issued.
153.  Costs.  The prospective tenant shall pay the cost of the screening service report.  A 
16 screening service may not impose a charge based on the number of applications in which 
17 the report is used. 
184.  Application fee.  If an owner of residential rental property or a residential rental 
19 property manager does not allow a prospective tenant to use a screening service report in 
20 an application for the rental of a residence, the owner or manager may not charge an 
21 application fee greater than $25.
22SUMMARY

26 report in an application for the rental of a residence, but the owner or manager is then 
27 limited to charging an application fee no greater than $25.23
