Page 1 - 131LR0246(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §104, first ¶, as amended by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. C, §109 and 
3 affected by PL 2019, c. 417, Pt. B, §14, is further amended to read:
4 An employer who that has secured the payment of compensation in conformity with 
5 sections 401 to 407 is exempt from civil actions, either at common law or under sections 
6 901 to 908; Title 14, sections 8101 to 8118; and Title 18‑C, section 2‑807, involving 
7 personal injuries sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of employment, 
8 or for death resulting from those injuries.  An employer that uses a private employment 
9 agency for temporary help services is entitled to the same immunity from civil actions by 
10 employees of the temporary help service as is granted with respect to the employer's own 
11 employees as long as the temporary help service has secured the payment of compensation 
12 in conformity with sections 401 to 407.  "Temporary help services" means a service where 
13 an agency assigns its own employees to a 3rd party to work under the direction and control 
14 of the 3rd party to support or supplement the 3rd party's work force in work situations such 
15 as employee absences, temporary skill shortages, seasonal work load conditions and special 
16 assignments and projects.  These exemptions from liability apply to all employees, 
17 supervisors, officers and directors of the employer for any personal injuries arising out of 
18 and in the course of employment, or for death resulting from those injuries.  These 
19 exemptions also apply to occupational diseases sustained by an employee or for death 
20 resulting from those diseases.  These exemptions do not apply to an illegally employed 
21 minor as described in section 408, subsection 2. These exemptions do not apply to an 
22 intentional act or omission.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill removes intentional acts and omissions from the exemptions from civil action 
25 related to damages sustained by an employee when an employer has secured payment of 
26 workers' compensation.24
