3SUMMARY
4 Public Law 2019, chapter 274 enacted the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 
5 3196, which requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide coverage 
6 to a MaineCare member for abortion services.  Abortion services that are not approved 
7 Medicaid services must be funded by the State.
8 The so-called federal Hyde Amendment prohibits federal Medicaid funding for 
9 abortions except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest.  This bill repeals Title 22, 
10 section 3196, removing the requirement that the department provide abortion services to 
11 MaineCare members and removing the requirement that the State pay when the abortion 
12 services are not covered by Medicaid.4
