37 subsection that is due as a result of the insured employer's failure to give timely notice or 
38 information to its insurer.

Page 4 - 131LR0344(01)46 manner that would not make the contractor an employee of the landowner or the landowner 
47 requests and receives a certificate of insurance, issued by the contractor's insurance carrier, 
48 certifying that the contractor has obtained the required coverage and indicating the effective 
49 dates of the policy, and if the landowner requests and receives at least annually similar 
50 certificates indicating continuing coverage during the performance of the work.  A 
51 landowner who receives a predetermination of the contractor's status as independent 
52 contractor or a certificate of independent status is only relieved of liability under this 
53 paragraph if the contract for wood harvesting expressly states that the independent 
54 contractor will not hire any employees to assist in the wood harvesting without first 
55 providing the required certificate of insurance to the landowner.
11Sec. 9.  39-A MRSA §401, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2011, c. 643, §12 and 
12 affected by §14, is further amended by amending the 2nd blocked paragraph to read:
13 Notwithstanding section 105, subsection 1, paragraph A, a  A predetermination under 
14 section 105  subsection 4-A related only to a person engaged in harvesting forest products 
15 is a conclusive presumption that the determination is correct and section 105, subsection 2 
16 does not apply to that determination.  Each party involved in or affected by the 
17 predetermination must be provided information on the workers' compensation laws and the 
18 effect of independent contractor status in relation to those laws.  A predetermination under 
19 section 105  subsection 4-A related to a person engaged in harvesting forest products is 
20 effective for one calendar year or the duration of the contract, whichever is shorter.
21Sec. 10.  39-A MRSA §401, sub-§4-A is enacted to read:
224-A.  Predetermination of independent contractor status.  A landowner and a 
23 contractor may submit to the board, on forms approved by the board, a request for 
24 predetermination of the status of the contractor as an independent contractor. 
25 A.  A request under this subsection is deemed to have been approved if the board does 
26 not deny or take other appropriate action on the submission within 30 days. 
27 B.  A hearing, if requested by a party within 10 days of the board's decision on a 
28 petition, must be conducted under the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.  A ruling 
29 by the board or administrative law judge under this paragraph is final and not subject 
30 to review by the Superior Court. 
31 C.  The board shall provide to each party a certified copy of the decision regarding 
32 predetermination that is to be used as evidence at a later hearing on benefits. 
33 D.  The board is authorized to adopt rules to implement this subsection.  Rules adopted 
34 pursuant to this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
35 subchapter 2-A.

Page 5 - 131LR0344(01)1 3.  It establishes that, if the board fails to adjust rates or update the medical fee schedule, 
2 the reimbursement rates for medical services will be the amount established by the medical 
3 fee schedule in effect on the date the update is due.
4 4.  It eliminates the requirement that the board adopt treatment protocols for specific 
5 injuries as part of a utilization review program.
6 5.  It simplifies the calculation of the after-tax benefit owed during an incapacity period 
7 when an employee also receives certain pension and disability benefits.
8 6.  It eliminates the provision stating that the insurer may seek reimbursement from an 
9 employer of a fine for a tardy filing of a first report of injury when the report was late 
10 because the employer did not give the insurer timely notice of the injury.
11 7.  It clarifies that an insurer may seek reimbursement from its insured employer whose 
12 failure to provide information to the insurer is the cause of the insurer’s failure to file or 
13 complete a form as required by law.
14 8.  It consolidates the predetermination of independent contractor process for 
15 landowners and wood harvesters.
