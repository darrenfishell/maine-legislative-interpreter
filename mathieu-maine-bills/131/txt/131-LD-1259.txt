30 recovery through judgment or settlement, a party that obtains a judgment or settlement 
31 awarding the party any nonmonetary relief sought in the action or proceeding, a party that

7 records for the prior 3 consecutive years.
8§1625.  Financial statement required

16 certain income requirements to recover costs and attorney's fees from any type of business 
17 or nonprofit entity recognized under the laws of the State if the individual is the prevailing
