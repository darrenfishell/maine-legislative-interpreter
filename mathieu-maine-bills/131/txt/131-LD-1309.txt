Page 1 - 131LR1003(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, Maine has committed to safeguarding and expanding the number of 
4 available slots for early childhood education across the State; and
5Whereas, certain special purpose private schools and private general purpose 
6 agencies that provide both educational services and medically necessary behavioral health 
7 services to children with disabilities who have not attained 6 years of age do not have access 
8 to tuition payments for educational services and are receiving only MaineCare payments 
9 for medically necessary behavioral health services; and
10Whereas, the ongoing lack of tuition payments for educational services threatens the 
11 continued economic viability of schools and agencies that provide both educational 
12 services and medically necessary behavioral health services to children with disabilities 
13 who have not attained 6 years of age and the ability of those schools and agencies to 
14 continue to provide needed special education services; and
15Whereas, a shortage of high-quality, affordable early childhood education and care is 
16 a crisis for affected families and for organizations who support them, and the young 
17 children with special education needs served by these agencies are not appropriately served 
18 by other available community child care providers; and
19Whereas, without these special purpose private preschools, hundreds of children 
20 would lose access to professional, specialized prekindergarten education and care and 
21 would likely become dependent upon their families for that education and care; and
22Whereas, specialized, early intervention is particularly vital for these children and 
23 families, since it gives these children the best chance to develop cognitive, physical, social 
24 and emotional skills to prepare them for future education and life challenges; and
25Whereas, tuition payments for educational services are provided to special purpose 
26 private schools and agencies serving children in elementary and secondary school, but are 
27 not provided when the child has not attained 6 years of age; and
28Whereas, restoration and full payment of tuition payments for educational services 
29 for children with disabilities who have not attained 6 years of age will improve the 
30 economic viability of schools and agencies and foster their ability to continue to provide 
31 these important services; and
32Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
33 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
34 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
35 therefore,
36Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
37Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §7302, sub-§2, ¶G is enacted to read:
38 G.  A special purpose private school or private general purpose agency that provides 
39 both educational and medically necessary behavioral health services to children with 
40 disabilities who have not attained 6 years of age is entitled to receive payment for the 
41 educational services they provide from the Child Development Services System.  
Page 2 - 131LR1003(01)42 Before the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year, the Child Development Services 
43 System shall cooperate with special purpose private schools and private general 
44 purpose agencies to establish appropriate daily rates for the educational component of 
45 services provided by special purpose private schools and private general purpose 
46 agencies, relying on the methodology currently being used for the establishment of 
47 daily rates for public schools and special purpose private schools serving children in 
48 elementary and secondary school.  Following the establishment of the daily rates, the 
49 Child Development Services System shall make payments required by this paragraph 
50 to special purpose private schools and private general purpose agencies at the 
51 established daily rates for the educational services they provide.
11Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
12 takes effect when approved.
13SUMMARY
14 This bill requires special purpose private schools and private general purpose agencies 
15 that provide both educational and behavioral health services to children with disabilities 
16 who have not attained 6 years of age receive payments for the educational services they 
17 provide from the Child Development Services System within the Department of Education.  
18 The bill requires that the Child Development Services System work with these private 
19 schools and general purpose agencies to establish, prior to the beginning of the 2023-2024 
20 school year, appropriate daily rates for payments for the educational component of their 
21 services.  These daily rates rely on the daily rate methodology now used. These daily rates 
22 must then be used to calculate payments for educational services.1
