7SUMMARY
8 This bill amends the State's freedom of access laws to increase the fee for a public 
9 records request from $25 per hour spent retrieving the public record to $40 per hour.  It 
10 provides that an agency or official may charge a fee for the first 2 hours of staff time per 
11 request when the person making the public records request of that agency or official has 
12 previously made a request during the same calendar year.
13 It requires that school personnel who are the subject of public records requests be 
14 notified and allows them opportunity to inspect the records before they are released.  If a 
15 school district believes a request is frivolous or designed to intimidate or harass, the school 
16 district is authorized to seek the opinion of the Public Access Ombudsman within the 
17 Department of the Attorney General regarding the request.
18 It provides that, if the Public Access Ombudsman determines that the request is part of 
19 a series of contemporaneous requests, or a pattern of requests, that are frivolous or designed 
20 to intimidate or harass and that the requests are not intended for the broad dissemination of 
21 information to the public about actual or alleged government activity, the Public Access 
22 Ombudsman is authorized to relieve the agency or official of the obligation to provide the 
23 records sought.  If the requestor disagrees with the denial of a request based on these 
24 standards, the requestor may appeal to the Superior Court.
25 It also directs the Public Access Ombudsman to create a simple, short form for public 
26 records requests.  A school district may require the use of this form for any public records
