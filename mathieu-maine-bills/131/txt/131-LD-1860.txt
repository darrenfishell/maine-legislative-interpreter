9 B. Agree not to refund, rebate or share money paid to the education service provider 
10 under the program with a parent or legal guardian of a participating student or a 
11 participating student, except that money may be remitted or refunded to an educational 
12 opportunity account in accordance with procedures established by the department.

26 A. Intentionally and substantially misrepresented information about the education 
27 services provided or failed to refund an overpayment in a timely manner; or
28 B. Routinely failed to provide students with promised educational goods or services.
29 The department shall create a fair process to determine whether an education service 
30 provider may be prohibited from participating in the program.
31 If the department prohibits an education service provider from participating in the program, 
32 the department shall notify parents and legal guardians of participating students served by 
33 the education service provider no later than 5 days after the prohibition is determined.

35 subsection.

39 department on:
40 A.  Whether money withdrawn from an educational opportunity account was used for 
41 a purpose described by section 17202, subsection 2. The commission may by majority 
Page 7 - 131LR0835(01)42 vote recommend to the department that a questionable expenditure be denied or 
43 approved;
3 B. Whether an education service provider should be allowed to receive or continue

7 or legal guardians of participating students, appointed by the commissioner for 2-year

9 year in which the participating student of the parent or legal guardian ceases participation 
10 in the program. The members must represent at least 4 counties in the State.  Members may 
11 be reappointed. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, serves as the nonvoting 
12 chair of the commission.  The commission may meet virtually.
13§17209.  Miscellaneous provisions
141. Records.  A public school or public charter school that previously enrolled a 
15 participating student shall provide a private school that is an education service provider and 
16 that has enrolled the participating student with a complete copy of the participating 
17 student's school records, while complying with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy 
18 Act of 1974, 20 United States Code, Section 1232g.
192. Intervention.  If any part of this chapter is challenged in a state court as violating 
20 either the Constitution of Maine or the United States Constitution, a parent or legal guardian 
21 of an eligible student or participating student may intervene in the lawsuit for the purposes 
22 of defending the program's constitutionality. A court may require that all parents or legal 
23 guardians file a joint brief, as long as they are not required to join any brief filed on behalf 
24 of any named state defendant.
253. Burden of proof.  In a legal proceeding challenging an action taken by the 
26 department under a rule adopted by the department toward an education service provider, 
27 the State has the burden of establishing that the rule is necessary and does not impose an 
28 undue burden on the education service provider.
294. Enrollment not required.  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require that 
30 a participating student must be enrolled, full-time or part-time, in either a private school or 
31 nonpublic online school.
32§17210.  Rules
33 The department shall adopt rules to implement this chapter.  Rules adopted pursuant to
