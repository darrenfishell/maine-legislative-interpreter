17 care community or the continuing care retirement community admits to its skilled nursing 
18 facility only persons who have been bona fide residents of the community prior to 
19 admission to the skilled nursing facility, then the community is exempt from the provisions 
20 of Title 22, chapter 103‑A, but is subject to the licensing provisions of Title 22, chapter 
21 405, and is entitled to only one skilled nursing facility bed for every 4 residential units in 
22 the community.  Any community exempted under Title 22, chapter 103‑A  rules adopted by 
23 the department may admit nonresidents of the community to its skilled nursing facility only 
24 during the first 3 years of operation.  For purposes of this subsection, a "bona fide resident" 
25 means a person who has been a resident of the community for a period of not less than 180 
26 consecutive days immediately preceding admission to the nursing facility or has been a 
27 resident of the community for less than 180 consecutive days but who has been medically 
28 admitted to the nursing facility resulting from an illness or accident that occurred 
29 subsequent to residence in the community.  Any community exempted under Title 22, 
30 chapter 103‑A  rules adopted by the department is not entitled to and may not seek any 
31 reimbursement or financial assistance under the MaineCare program from any state or 
32 federal agency and, as a consequence, that community must continue to provide nursing 
33 facility services to any person who has been admitted to the facility.
34 Notwithstanding this subsection, a life-care community that holds a final certificate of 
35 authority from the superintendent and that was operational on November 18, 2002 and that 
36 is barred from seeking reimbursement or financial assistance under the MaineCare program 
37 from a state or federal agency may continue to admit nonresidents of the community to its 
38 skilled nursing facility after its first 3 years of operation with the approval of the 
39 superintendent.  A life-care community that admits nonresidents to its skilled nursing 
40 facility as permitted under this subsection may continue to admit nonresidents after its first 
41 3 years of operation only for such period as approved by the superintendent after the 
42 superintendent's consideration of the financial impact on the life-care community and the 
43 impact on the contractual rights of subscribers of the community.

5 recommendations to the certificate of need program under Title 22, chapter 103‑A.

9 The trust shall develop and implement a process to review projects undertaken by 
10 health care facilities that are directed solely at reducing energy costs through energy 
11 efficiency, renewable energy technology or smart grid technology and to certify those 
12 projects that are likely to be cost-effective.  If a project is certified as likely to be cost-
13 effective by the trust, the review process serves as an alternative to the certificate of need 
14 process established pursuant to Title 22, section 329, subsection 3.
15Sec. 18.  38 MRSA §1310-X, sub-§4, ¶A, as amended by PL 2003, c. 551, §17, is 
16 further amended to read:
17 A.  A commercial biomedical waste disposal or treatment facility, if at least 51% of the 
18 facility is owned by a licensed hospital or hospitals as defined in Title 22, section 328, 
19 subsection 14 or a group of hospitals that are licensed under Title 22 acting through a 
20 statewide association of Maine hospitals or a wholly owned affiliate of the association; 
21 and
22SUMMARY
23 Under current law, before introducing additional health care services and procedures 
24 in a market area, a person must apply for and receive a certificate of need from the 
25 Department of Health and Human Services. This bill eliminates that requirement.23
