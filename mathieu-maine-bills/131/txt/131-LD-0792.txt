3ยง5213-B.  Turnpike motor fuel fairness credit
4 For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, a Maine resident individual is 
5 allowed a turnpike motor fuel fairness credit as computed under this section against the 
6 taxes imposed under this Part.
71.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
8 following terms have the following meanings.
9 A.  "Turnpike" has the same meaning as in Title 23, section 1964, subsection 9.
10 B.  "Turnpike gallons of motor fuel used" means the turnpike miles driven attributable 
11 to motor vehicles owned by a resident individual divided by 40.
12 C.  "Turnpike miles driven" means the number of miles that motor vehicles owned by 
13 a resident individual are driven on the turnpike during the tax year.
142.  Credit calculation.  The credit under this section is equal to the per gallon fuel tax 
15 rate applicable to the type of motor fuel used by the resident individual multiplied by the 
16 number of turnpike gallons of motor fuel used by motor vehicles owned by the resident 
17 individual.
183.  Refundability of credit.  The tax credit under this section is refundable after the 
19 application of nonrefundable credits.
204.  Transfer from Highway Fund.  At the end of each fiscal year, the State Tax 
21 Assessor shall notify the Treasurer of State of the amount of income tax revenue forgone 
22 as a result of the tax credit provided under this section.  The Treasurer of State shall transfer 
23 that amount of money from the Highway Fund to the General Fund.  For the purposes of 
24 Title 30-A, section 5681, transfers under this subsection are considered to be receipts from 
25 the tax imposed under this Part.
265.  Exclusion.  Electric vehicles do not qualify for a credit under this section.
27SUMMARY
28 This bill provides a refundable income tax credit based on the type of fuel used by 
29 motor vehicles owned by a Maine resident and the number of miles the vehicles traveled 
30 on the Maine Turnpike.28
