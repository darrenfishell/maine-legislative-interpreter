2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §403, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
34.  Prohibition.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the clerk of court may not issue a 
4 subpoena pursuant to this section if the foreign subpoena is based on a violation of another 
5 state's laws that interfere with a person's right to allow a child to receive gender-affirming 
6 health care or gender-affirming mental health care.  For the purposes of this subsection, 
7 "gender-affirming health care" and "gender-affirming mental health care" have the same 
8 meanings as in Title 19-A, section 1732.
9Sec. 2.  15 MRSA §230 is enacted to read:

13 following terms have the following meanings.

15 the gender identity of the patient, as experienced and defined by the patient, including, 
16 but not limited to, the following:
17 (1)  Interventions to suppress the development of endogenous secondary sex

25 health care that respects the gender identity of the patient, as experienced and defined 
26 by the patient, including, but not limited to, developmentally appropriate exploration 
27 and integration of identity, reduction of distress, adaptive coping and strategies to 
28 increase family acceptance.
292.  Public policy.  It is the public policy of this State that an out-of-state arrest warrant 
30 for an individual based on violating another state's law against providing, receiving or 
31 allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health 
32 care is the lowest law enforcement priority.
333.  Prohibitions.  A law enforcement agency may not knowingly make or participate 
34 in the arrest or participate in any extradition of an individual pursuant to an out-of-state 
35 arrest warrant for violation of another state's law against providing, receiving or allowing 
36 a child to receive gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care in 
37 this State, if that care is lawful under the laws of this State, to the fullest extent permitted 
38 by federal law. A state or local law enforcement agency may not cooperate with or provide 
39 information to any individual or out-of-state agency or department regarding the provision 
40 of lawful gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care performed 
41 in this State.
Page 2 - 131LR0848(01)14.  Investigation; sharing of information.  Nothing in this section prohibits the

35 the child is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or because the child has

37Sec. 7.  19-A MRSA §1751, sub-§2-A is enacted to read:

6 purposes of obtaining gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care 
7 for the child and the law or policy of the other state limits the ability of a parent to obtain 
8 gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care for the parent's child.

23SUMMARY
24 This bill prohibits the enforcement of an order based on another state's law authorizing 
25 a child to be removed from the child's parent or guardian based on that parent or guardian 
26 allowing the child to receive gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental 
27 health care. The bill prohibits a court from finding that it is an inconvenient forum if the 
28 law or policy of another state that may take jurisdiction limits the ability of a parent to 
29 obtain gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care for a child and 
30 the provision of that care is at issue in the case before the court. The bill authorizes a court 
31 to take temporary jurisdiction because a child has been unable to obtain gender-affirming 
32 health care or gender-affirming mental health care. The bill prohibits a court from 
33 considering the taking or retention of a child from a person who has legal custody of the 
34 child if the taking or retention was for obtaining gender-affirming health care or 
35 gender-affirming mental health care for the child. The bill prohibits a health care 
36 practitioner, health care facility or state-designated statewide health information exchange 
37 from releasing medical information related to a person or entity allowing a child to receive 
38 gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care in response to a 
39 criminal or civil action, including a foreign subpoena, based on another state's law that 
40 authorizes a person to bring a civil or criminal action against a person or entity that allows 
41 a child to receive gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care. The 
42 bill prohibits law enforcement agencies from knowingly making or participating in the 
43 arrest or extradition of an individual pursuant to an out-of-state arrest warrant based on 24
