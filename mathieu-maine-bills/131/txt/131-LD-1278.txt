6 of the family of the employer and salaried employees.  Each payment must include all 
7 wages earned to within 8 days of the payment date.  Payments that fall on a day when the 
8 business is regularly closed must be paid no later than the following business day.  An 
9 employee who is absent from work at a time fixed for payment must be paid as if the 
10 employee was not absent. For purposes of this subsection, "members of the family of the 
11 employer" and "salaried employees" have the same meanings as described in section 663, 
12 subsection 3, paragraphs J and K, respectively.

21 requirements of chapter 15; the federal Davis-Bacon Act, 40 United States Code, Section 
22 276a et seq.; or other applicable federal or state law, an employer need not provide advance 
23 notice prior to returning the employee to the employee's regular wage rate, as long as the

31 employee pursuant to section 621‑A.  Every employer shall keep a daily record of the time 
32 worked by each such employee unless the employee is paid a salary that is fixed without 
33 regard for the number of hours worked , except salaried employees as described in section 
34 663, subsection 3, paragraph K.  Records required to be kept by this section must be 
35 accessible to any representative of the department at any reasonable hour.  Sections 621‑A 
36 to 623 and 622 do not excuse any employer subject to section 774 from keeping the records 
37 required by that section.
38Sec. 4.  26 MRSA §623, as amended by PL 2005, c. 18, §2, is further amended to

47 Except as provided in section 621‑A, subsections 3, 4 and 5, a corporation, contractor,
