Page 1 - 131LR0945(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §265 is enacted to read:
3§265.  Budget neutrality prohibited
4 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the department may not 
5 implement policies or practices or adopt or enforce rules that provide that costs must be 
6 fully offset by reductions in MaineCare costs relating to nursing facilities, residential care 
7 facilities or private nonmedical institutions.
8Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §329, sub-§6, ¶A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 424, Pt. B, §1 and 
9 affected by Pt. E, §1, is further amended to read:
10 A.  A nursing facility converting beds used for the provision of nursing services to beds 
11 to be used for the provision of residential care services. If such a conversion occurs, 
12 MaineCare and other public funds may not be obligated for payment of services 
13 provided in the converted beds unless approved by the department pursuant to the 
14 provisions of sections 333‑A and 334‑A.  In order to approve a conversion under this 
15 paragraph, the department must determine that any increased MaineCare residential 
16 care costs associated with the converted beds are fully offset by reductions in the 
17 MaineCare costs from the reduction in MaineCare nursing facility costs associated with 
18 the converted beds;
19Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §333-A, sub-§3-A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 648, §4, is further 
20 amended to read:
213-A.  Transfers between nursing facility and residential care facility.  A nursing 
22 facility may delicense and sell or transfer beds to a residential care facility for the purpose 
23 of permitting the residential care facility to add MaineCare-funded beds to meet identified 
24 needs for such beds.  Such a transfer does not require a certificate of need but is subject to 
25 prior approval of the department on an expedited basis.  The divisions within the 
26 department that are responsible for licensing and MaineCare reimbursement for nursing 
27 facilities and residential care facilities shall work cooperatively to review and consider 
28 whether to approve such transfers on an expedited basis.  When the average then current 
29 occupancy rate for existing state-funded residential care beds within 30 miles of the 
30 applicant facility is 80% or less, the department in its review under section 335 shall 
31 evaluate the impact that the proposed additional state-funded residential care beds would 
32 have on these existing state-funded residential care beds and facilities.  Beds and 
33 MaineCare resources transferred pursuant to this subsection are not subject to the nursing 
34 facility MaineCare funding pool.  In order for the department to approve delicensing, 
35 selling or transferring under this subsection, the department must determine that any 
36 increased MaineCare residential care costs associated with the converted beds are fully 
37 offset by reductions in the MaineCare costs from the reduction in MaineCare nursing 
38 facility costs associated with the converted beds.
39Sec. 4.  22 MRSA §334-A, sub-§1-A, ¶B, as amended by PL 2011, c. 648, §5, is 
40 further amended by repealing subparagraph (1).
41Sec. 5.  Department of Health and Human Services to amend rules to 
42remove so-called budget neutrality for nursing facilities, private nonmedical 
43institutions and residential care facilities.  No later than January 1, 2024, the 
Page 2 - 131LR0945(01)44 Department of Health and Human Services shall amend its rules to remove all requirements 
45 of and references to provisions that costs must be fully offset by reductions in MaineCare 
46 costs, or so-called budget neutrality, in all rules affecting the nursing facilities, residential 
47 care facilities or private nonmedical institutions or in the certificate of need process related 
48 to nursing facilities, including but not limited to:
6 1. 10-149 C.M.R. Chapter 5: Office of Aging and Disability Services Policy Manual, 
7 Section 71, Certificate of Need for Nursing Facility Level of Care Projects;
8 2. 10-144 C.M.R. Chapter 110: Regulations Governing the Licensing and Functioning 
9 of Skilled Nursing Facilities and Nursing Facilities;
10 3. 10-144 C.M.R. Chapter 115: Principles of Reimbursement for Residential Care 
11 Facilities - Room and Board Costs;
12 4. Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 67, Principles of 
13 Reimbursement for Nursing Facilities; and
14 5. Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 97, Private Non-
15 Medical Institution Services, including Appendices B, C, D, E and F.  
16SUMMARY
17 This bill eliminates the so-called budget neutrality provisions relating to transferring 
18 and selling beds between nursing facilities and residential care facilities, converting beds 
19 from nursing services to residential care services and delicensing nursing facility beds.  It 
20 directs the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules regarding nursing 
21 facilities, residential care facilities and private nonmedical institutions to remove all 
22 requirements of and references to provisions that costs must be fully offset by reductions 
23 in MaineCare costs, or so-called budget neutrality, in all rules affecting nursing facilities, 
24 residential care facilities or private nonmedical institutions or the certificate of need process 
25 for nursing facilities.  It prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from 
26 implementing so-called budget neutrality in its policies or practices or by adopting or 
27 enforcing rules relating to nursing facilities, residential care facilities and private 
28 nonmedical institutions.1
