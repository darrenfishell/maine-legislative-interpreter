19 A.  As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following 
20 terms have the following meanings.
21 (1)  "Constitutional right" means any right guaranteed under the United States 
22 Constitution or the Constitution of Maine, including, but not limited to, the right 
23 to:
24 (a) Travel, work, assemble and speak;

3 orders pursuant to this subsection.  The court shall expedite consideration of a case

5 applicability of the impact of emergency orders on analogous groups, situations and 
6 circumstances may constitute one ground among others for a court to invalidate or 
7 enjoin an emergency order, or some of its applications, on the basis that it is not 
8 narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose.

18 terminate a state of emergency at anytime  any time.  Thereupon, the The Governor shall 
19 then issue an executive proclamation ending the state of emergency.
20SUMMARY
21 This bill:
22 1. Requires the emergency powers exercised by the Governor, a person within the 
23 executive branch or a municipal official that bind, curtail or infringe on the rights of private 
24 parties to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose and to 
25 be limited in duration, applicability and scope to reduce any infringement of individual 
26 liberty.  Only the Governor may issue an order that infringes on a right guaranteed under 
27 the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Maine, including, but not limited to, 
28 freedom of travel, assembly, work, speech and religion and freedom to purchase and 
29 possess firearms and ammunition.  That order must be narrowly tailored to serve a 
30 compelling public health or safety purpose limited in duration, applicability and scope to 
31 reduce any infringement of a constitutional right;
32 2. Gives a state court jurisdiction to hear a case challenging the legality of the exercise 
33 of emergency powers and requires the court to expedite consideration of the case to the 
34 extent practicable.  Inequality in the applicability of the impact of emergency orders on 
35 analogous groups, situations and circumstances may constitute one ground among others 
36 for a court to invalidate or enjoin an emergency order, or some of its applications, on the 
37 basis that it is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose;
38 3. Requires the Governor to convene the Legislature if a declared state of emergency 
39 is to be in effect for longer than 30 days.  If the Legislature does not, by a 2/3 vote in each

41 declare a similar, subsequent state of emergency;

43 that is substantially similar to one that expired or reissue an emergency proclamation 
44 terminated by the Legislature without approval of the Legislature; and21
