Page 1 - 131LR0105(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the federal FAFSA Simplification Act, Public Law 116-260, Sections 701 
4 to 706 (2020) made significant changes to the underlying processes and methodologies for 
5 determining federal student aid eligibility; and
6Whereas, most of these provisions are scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2023; and
7Whereas,  the Maine State Grant Program, set forth in the Maine Revised Statutes, 
8 Title 20-A, sections 11611 to 11619-A, relies in part on submission of the free application 
9 for federal student aid and uses the outdated term "expected family contribution" in 
10 determining awards; and
11Whereas,  if this legislation is not enacted on an emergency basis, the Maine State 
12 Grant Program will use an outdated term and risk confusing participants; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore,
17Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §11611, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2001, c. 70, §3, is 
19 repealed.
20Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §11611, sub-§7 is enacted to read:
217.  Student aid index.  "Student aid index" means a calculation that reflects an

23 postsecondary education for an academic year.
24Sec. 3.  20-A MRSA §11613, first ¶, as amended by PL 2003, c. 103, §1, is further 
25 amended to read:
26 The authority shall establish the need of a student for a Maine State Grant for an 
27 academic year for which the student applies.  A student is considered to have a need to 
28 qualify for a grant if the total of the cost of attendance of the student, minus the expected 
29 family contribution for the student, minus estimated student financial assistance not 
30 received under this program, is greater than zero.  The total of the expected family 
31 contribution, together with any other student financial assistance received by the student, 
32 In doing so, the authority shall consider the cost of attendance of the student, the student 
33 aid index and estimated student financial assistance not received under this program. The 
34 total cost determined by these factors may not exceed the cost of attendance at the 
35 institution the student attends.
36Sec. 4.  20-A MRSA §11613, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1989, c. 559, §10, is 
37 repealed.
38Sec. 5.  20-A MRSA §11614, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2001, c. 70, §8, is further 
39 amended to read:
Page 2 - 131LR0105(01)11.  Priority for awards of grants.  Students with the lowest expected family 
2 contributions student aid index must be given priority over all other eligible students for 
3 the awards of grants.
4Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
5 takes effect when approved.
