3 amended to read:
4 A.  To provide for the balance of the reasonable expenses incurred to fulfill the bureau's 
5 duty pursuant to this Title, including general regulatory costs, overhead, transportation 
6 and general office and administrative expenses, except as otherwise provided in this 
7 paragraph, the superintendent shall assess each financial institution under the 
8 superintendent's supervision at the annual rate of at least 6¢ for each $1,000 of the total 
9 of average assets, as defined by the superintendent.  The frequency of assessment may 
10 coincide with the frequency of filing periodic financial reports with the bureau but may 
11 not be more frequent than quarterly.  The superintendent may raise the minimum 
12 assessment rate of 6¢ for each $1,000 of the total of average assets by promulgating  
13 adopting rules pursuant to section 251 at such time as economic conditions warrant 
14 such an increase. In Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, in no event may 
15 the assessment be less than $25.  The superintendent may lower or suspend by rule or 
16 order any assessment specified in this paragraph or established by rule pursuant to this 
17 paragraph.  Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph are routine technical rules as 
18 defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.

24 or an amount determined by the superintendent of at least 6¢ for every $10,000 of fiduciary 
25 assets under its management, custody or care.  The superintendent may further define by

27 assessment whenever economic conditions warrant such a change.  The superintendent may 
28 lower or suspend by rule or order any assessment specified in this subsection or established 
29 by rule pursuant to this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine 
30 technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.  These assessments must

37 a judgment by the superintendent that the bureau lacks the present capacity to 
38 adequately ensure the safety and soundness of the proposed institution or activity. The 
39 superintendent shall promptly provide notice of any suspension or postponement in the 
40 same manner and in the same publications in which the original notice of application 
41 was provided. If and when action is resumed on the application, the superintendent 
42 shall again provide notice in the same manner and in the same publications in which 
43 the preceding notices were provided.
Page 2 - 131LR0144(01)1Sec. 4.  9-B MRSA §367-A, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 83, §10, is amended

36.  Mergers.  The conservator or receiver, with the approval of the superintendent, may 
4 order the merger or consolidation of any financial institution that is described in section 
5 363‑A or 365 with any other financial institution, state-chartered or federally chartered, 
6 with the consent of the other financial institution and may prescribe the mode or procedure 
7 for the merger or consolidation and the terms and conditions of the merger or consolidation.  
8 Unless limited by the conservator or receiver, the effect of the merger on various property 
9 interests and fiduciary designations of the resulting institution is the same as described for 
10 mergers subject to section 357, subsection 1.  
11Sec. 5.  9-B MRSA §367-A, sub-§7 is enacted to read:
127.  Fiduciary accounts.  A conservator or receiver may terminate fiduciary positions 
13 of the financial institution, surrender property held by the financial institution as a fiduciary 
14 and settle fiduciary accounts. The conservator or receiver may release fiduciary property 
15 to one or more successor fiduciaries, and may sell one or more fiduciary accounts to one 
16 or more successor fiduciaries. Upon a sale or transfer of a financial institution's fiduciary 
17 property or a fiduciary account by a conservator or receiver, the successor fiduciary is 
18 automatically substituted without further action and without any order of any court.  The 
19 conservator or receiver shall provide notice of the substitution, as far as practicable, to each 
20 person to whom the financial institution provides periodic reports of fiduciary activity.  The 
21 notice must include the name of the financial institution, the name of the successor 
22 fiduciary and the effective date of the substitution.  The successor fiduciary has all of the 
23 rights, powers, duties and obligations of the transferring financial institution and is deemed 
24 to be named, nominated or appointed as fiduciary in any will, trust, court order or similar 
25 written document or instrument that names, nominates or appoints the transferring financial 
26 institution as fiduciary, whether executed before or after the substitution.  The successor 
27 fiduciary has no obligations or liabilities under this chapter for any acts, actions, inactions 
28 or events occurring prior to the effective date of the substitution.
29Sec. 6.  9-B MRSA §1231, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 398, Pt. J, §2, is amended to 
30 read:
31§1231.  General authority and purpose
32 A financial institution engaged in the business of banking that does not accept retail 
33 deposits and for which insurance of deposits by the FDIC is not required may be organized 
34 pursuant to chapter 31.  Unless otherwise indicated in this chapter, an uninsured bank has 
35 all the powers, rights, duties and obligations as a financial institution under this Title.  An 
36 uninsured bank is not a nondepository trust company or a merchant bank.
37SUMMARY
38 This bill provides the Superintendent of Financial Institutions with the authority to 
39 reduce assessments by rule or order.  Current law only allows the Bureau of Financial 
40 Institutions to raise assessments.
41 The bill clarifies that the superintendent may suspend or postpone action on an 
42 application submitted to the bureau in the event that the bureau has no present capacity to 
43 supervise the applicant based on a lack of personnel or tools to adequately supervise certain 38

45 soundness of the institution.
3 The bill amends the processes for liquidations of financial institutions to provide that, 
4 like standard mergers, fiduciary accounts are automatically transferred to the surviving 
5 institution in the event of a merger conducted as part of a liquidation, thus removing the 
6 need for such accounts to be transferred by court processes or obtaining consent of account 
7 beneficiaries.
8 The bill clarifies that an uninsured bank must be engaged in the business of banking in 
9 order to be organized under the laws governing investor-owned institutions.1
