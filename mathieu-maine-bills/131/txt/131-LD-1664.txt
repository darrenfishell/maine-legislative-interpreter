15 recent state valuation relative to the state fiscal year for which reimbursement is being 
16 issued, as determined by the State Tax Assessor in the statement filed as provided in Title 
17 36, section 381, the Department of Health and Human Services shall reimburse the 
18 municipality for 90% of the amount in excess of these expenditures when the department 
19 finds that the municipality has been in compliance with all requirements of this chapter.  If 
20 a municipality elects to determine need without consideration of funds distributed from any 
21 municipally-controlled trust fund that must otherwise be considered for purposes of this
