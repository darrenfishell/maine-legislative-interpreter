Page 1 - 131LR0922(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation is needed to immediately remove the requirements for prior 
4 authorization and step therapy for medications used to treat serious mental illness, 
5 requirements that create unnecessary and potentially devastating interruptions in patient 
6 care and unnecessary burdens for health care providers and that have the unintentional 
7 effect of more costly and catastrophic outcomes; and
8Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
11 therefore,
12Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
13Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง3174-KKK is enacted to read:
