Page 1 - 131LR0730(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, Maine is experiencing an unprecedented, severe and persistent shortage of 
4 essential support workers needed to care for and support older people, people with physical 
5 and intellectual disabilities and people with behavioral health challenges; and
6Whereas, Maine people in all settings who are entitled to care and support are unable 
7 to secure the care and support they need due to this workforce shortage; and
8Whereas, older people, people with physical and intellectual disabilities and people 
9 with behavioral health challenges are being harmed by being unable to receive the care and 
10 support they need; and
11Whereas, hundreds of people each week are living in hospitals because of this 
12 workforce shortage, taking beds that are critically needed for other patients; and
13Whereas, this workforce shortage continues to grow despite state agencies and the 
14 Legislature taking many critical steps to increase wages and attract workers to these jobs; 
15 and
16Whereas, it is essential to create additional incentives for workers to choose these 
17 jobs and remain in them before the date that nonemergency legislation becomes effective 
18 for this Legislature; and
19Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
20 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
21 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
22 therefore,
23Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
