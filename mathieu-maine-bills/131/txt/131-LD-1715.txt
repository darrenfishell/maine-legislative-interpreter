7 correctional facility to supervised community confinement status without meeting the 
8 eligibility requirements of subsection 2, paragraphs B and C and without meeting the 
9 criteria or fulfilling the process provided for under subsection 2-A if the department's 
10 director of medical care has determined that the prisoner resident of a correctional facility 
11 has a terminal or severely incapacitating medical condition and that care outside a 
12 correctional facility is medically appropriate.  A resident of a correctional facility

24 inapplicable.  The prisoner client shall provide any information pertaining to the prisoner's 
25 client's medical condition or care that is requested by the commissioner at any time while 
26 the prisoner client is on supervised community confinement.   If the commissioner 
27 determines that the prisoner client has failed to fully comply with a request or if at any time 
28 the department's director of medical care determines that the prisoner client does not have 
29 a terminal or severely incapacitating medical condition or that care outside a correctional 
30 facility is not medically appropriate, the commissioner shall revoke the transfer to 
31 supervised community confinement.
3211.  Revocation of transfer.  The commissioner may revoke a transfer to supervised 
33 community confinement at any time for any reason in the commissioner's discretion.

38 of a correctional facility eligible for transfer to supervised community confinement may be 
39 approved for transfer.
