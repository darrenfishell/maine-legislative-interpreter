9 treatment as described in Title 34-A, section 3052, subsection 1-B.  The department shall 
10 provide individuals served under this section with weekly screening for a period of 3 years

13 assisted treatment.  
142.  Costs.  Recovery residence placement for individuals released from Department of 
15 Corrections custody must be provided at a cost that is no greater than the cost of providing

17Sec. 2.  34-A MRSA §3052, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 706, §1 and

25 substance use disorder, including alcohol use disorder, including at least one of each 
26 formulation of all United States Food and Drug Administration-approved medication-
27 assisted treatments for those disorders.
28Sec. 3.  34-A MRSA §3052, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:

39 30% of individuals in the program no longer requiring medication-assisted treatment or 
40 alternative treatment as determined by correctional facility medical staff after participating

43 in other program activities, including, but not limited to, individual or group counseling,

45 must demonstrate that those individuals are identified as no longer requiring medication-
46 assisted treatment or alternative treatment after one year and 2 years following the 
47 discontinuation of medication-assisted treatment or alternative treatment.  The program 
48 must ensure that those individuals who are identified as no longer requiring medication-
49 assisted treatment or alternative treatment undertake weekly screening that demonstrates 
50 no evidence of substance use, medication-assisted treatment or alternative treatment.  The 
51 30% of individuals in the program who are identified as no longer requiring medication-
52 assisted treatment or alternative treatment may include individuals who reside in 
53 correctional facilities or individuals who have been released but continue to receive 
54 services after release as established in subsection 3 and Title 5, section 20056.

15 department shall contract with another organization for a comprehensive substance use 
16 disorder treatment program within 6 months of the failure or at the end of the contracted 
17 period if less than 6 months.
18SUMMARY
19 This bill makes changes to the comprehensive substance use disorder treatment 
20 program maintained by the Commissioner of Corrections for individuals residing in 
21 correctional facilities and for individuals released from Department of Corrections custody.
22 1. It requires correctional facilities to offer alternative treatment that is plant-based, 
23 including traditional herbal medications or cannabis products, to residents receiving 
24 treatment for substance use disorder. If requested, the alternative treatment must be 
25 provided.  Such treatments must be legal in this State but do not need to be approved by 
26 the United States Food and Drug Administration.
27 2. It requires the program to adopt a standard that requires 30% of participants in the 
28 program to no longer require medication-assisted treatment or alternative treatment after 6 
29 months.  The program must continue to show that participants no longer require such 
30 medications or alternative treatment after one year and 2 years.  The 30% may include 
31 individuals who continue to reside in correctional facilities or have been released and are 
32 receiving services in the community.
33 3. If the contracted organization providing services to the correctional facilities does 
34 not maintain the standard of 30% of participants no longer requiring medical or alternative 
35 treatment, the contract must be cancelled and the Department of Corrections must seek a 
36 new provider.
37 4. It requires those individuals identified as no longer requiring medical or alternative 
38 treatment to undertake weekly screening for 3 years.  
39 5. It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide recovery 
40 residence placements to individuals who were receiving services in correctional facilities 
41 and have been identified as no longer requiring medication-assisted treatment or alternative 
42 treatment.  The cost of each placement must be no more than the cost of providing a hotel 
43 room in the area to the individual.1
