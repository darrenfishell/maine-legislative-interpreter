22SUMMARY
23 This bill implements the recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory Committee 
24 related to records of disciplinary actions against public employees. 
25 The bill provides that, notwithstanding any collective bargaining agreement or other 
26 employment contract entered into on or after January 1, 2024 to the contrary, local 
27 government records may not be disposed of except in accordance with record retention 
28 schedules established by the State Archivist. 
29 The bill amends the statutes governing state, municipal and county employee personnel 
30 records to require that, in response to Freedom of Access Act requests for final written 
31 decisions, the responding public body provide the records in its possession or custody 
32 regardless of the specific file location in which the final written decision is located.  The 
33 bill also requires the final written decisions applicable to state and county employees to 
34 state the conduct or other facts on the basis of which the disciplinary action is being 
35 imposed and the conclusions of the state or county employer as to the reasons for that 
36 action.  Similar language is already included in the statute governing municipal employee 
37 personnel records.
38 The bill directs the State Archivist to revise the record retention schedules applicable 
39 to state and local government personnel records to require that final written decisions 
40 relating to disciplinary action be maintained for a period of 20 years or a lesser period 
41 depending on the severity of the conduct or disciplinary action.  The State Archivist may 
42 increase the retention period beyond 20 years for final written decisions relating to law 
43 enforcement employee disciplinary actions that could be used to impeach the credibility of 23
24
Page 4 - 131LR2477(01)44 the law enforcement officer if the law enforcement officer is a witness in a criminal case.  
45 It also requires that the schedules use consistent terminology and define terms related to 
46 the disposition of records.1
