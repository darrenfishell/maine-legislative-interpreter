24§4317-A.  Use of available resources
251.  Definition.  For the purposes of this section, "available resource" means any 
26 resource that is immediately available or can be secured without delay, including but not 
27 limited to cash on hand or in bank accounts, support from relatives, any state, federal or

37 pursuant to subsection 4.
383.  Forfeiture of benefits.  An applicant who forfeits receipt of or causes a reduction

41 a rule governing an available resource without just cause is not eligible to receive general 
42 assistance to replace the forfeited benefits for the duration of a sanction imposed on the 
Page 2 - 131LR0626(01)43 applicant for violation of a rule governing an available resource or 120 days, whichever is

7 the provider of the available resource that interferes with any right secured by the 
8 United States Constitution or the Constitution of Maine;
9 B.  Discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, sex, sexual 
10 orientation, gender identity, physical or mental disability, religion, ancestry or national 
11 origin, age or familial status;
12 C.  The use of the available resource jeopardizing the health or safety of an applicant 
13 or applicant's household;
14 D.  A natural disaster that makes the available resource uninhabitable or unavailable;
15 E.  Abandonment of shelter housing in order to obtain permanent housing;

17 transportation or medical illness or injury;
18 G.  Just cause as defined in section 4316-A, subsection 5; or
19 H.  Any other evidence that is reasonable and appropriate.

24 to use an available resource without just cause ineligible to receive general assistance to 
25 replace the abandoned resource for a period of 120 days from the date the applicant 
26 abandons the resource.  The bill defines "available resource" as a resource that is 
27 immediately available or can be secured without delay.  The bill also makes an applicant 
28 who forfeits receipt of or causes a reduction in benefits from an available resource due to 
29 fraud, misrepresentation or intentional violation or refusal to comply with rules without 
30 just cause ineligible to receive general assistance to replace the forfeited or reduced benefits
