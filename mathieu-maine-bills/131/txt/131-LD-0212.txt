6 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an 
7 amount not exceeding $50,000,000 for the purposes described in section 5 of this Act.  The 
8 bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may not run for a 
9 period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
10Sec. 2.  Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer of State

15 may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may be 
16 loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 
17 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 
18 upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set 
19 forth in this Act.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project 
20 in this Act lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of 
21 general obligation bonds.

31 upgrade of municipal culverts at stream crossings in order to improve fish and wildlife 
32 habitats and increase community safety.  Eligible project sponsors include local 
33 governments, municipal conservation commissions, soil and water conservation districts 
34 and private nonprofit organizations.  A proposal for funding from an eligible project 
35 sponsor must include a map and summary of the proposed project, describing: 
361.  Contribution to competitive grant program goals.  The extent to which the 
37 proposed project allows communities to more effectively prepare for storm and flood

39 brook trout, and wildlife, including:
40 A.  The priority status of the culvert to be upgraded or replaced for native brook trout 
41 and sea run fish restoration, based on available stream survey data, statewide 
42 prioritization for aquatic connectivity and presence in priority watersheds of salmon, 
43 alewives and other diadromous fishes;
Page 2 - 131LR0612(01)1 B.  The extent to which the proposed project meets the Department of Environmental 
2 Protection's design standard of at least 1.2 times the stream's bankfull width, with a 
3 natural stream bottom or embedded structure, and meets or exceeds the Department of 
4 Transportation's 50-year flood standard;
5 C.  The degree of urgency of the proposed project, including whether a culvert is at 
6 high risk of failure due to age or location within a watershed or reach with high flood 
7 risk or severe flood history; and
8 D.  The expected contribution to reducing the frequency or severity of flooding to 
9 upstream and downstream communities and improving storm water management 
10 within the proposed project area.
11 The description must include confirmation that the culvert proposed for upgrade or 
12 replacement is on a municipal road, not a state road or private road; and
132.  Cost-effectiveness.  The extent to which the proposed project represents an efficient 
14 and cost-effective investment, including the proportion of total project funding that will be 
15 provided from other sources and the potential avoided costs associated with the proposed 
16 project.  Funds may not be used to cover all of the costs associated with a proposed project.
