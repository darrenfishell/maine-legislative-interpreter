39 This bill implements the recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory Committee 
40 to amend provisions in the Freedom of Access Act concerning time estimates for 
41 responding to public records requests by:39

Page 2 - 131LR2474(01)1 1.  Clarifying that an agency or official must specify the estimated time frame within 
2 which an agency or official will comply with a request for public records; and 
3 2.  Clarifying statutory language to better describe the scope of the fee charged by an 
4 agency or official for searching for, retrieving and compiling a requested public record. 
5 The bill also increases the cost threshold for when an agency or official must inform a 
6 requester of the estimate of the total cost before proceeding with a request for public 
7 records.  Under current law, an estimate of the total cost is required when the cost is 
8 estimated to be greater than $30. The bill requires an estimate of the total cost to be 
9 provided when the cost is estimated to be greater than $50, to be consistent with Public 
10 Law 2021, chapter 375, which increased the hourly fee for staff time that may be charged 
11 by an agency or official from $15 to $25.
