19 insurer's total liability under the provision required under subsection 2 may not exceed

27 to the extinguishment of a fire at a residential property owned or rented by the resident. 
28 Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit the indemnification of a municipality 
29 in accordance with Title 24-A, section 3044.
30SUMMARY
31 This bill requires a property insurance policy delivered or issued for delivery in this 
32 State to include a provision for the indemnification of a municipality for the actual costs 
33 for water service, not to exceed $3,000, incurred by the municipality for the water used in 
34 connection with extinguishing a fire at an insured's noncommercial property. The bill 
35 requires the Superintendent of Insurance to adopt rules governing priority of payment when 
36 more than one municipality incurs costs for water service used in connection with 
37 extinguishing a fire at an insured's property. The bill also prohibits a municipality from 
38 seeking reimbursement from a resident for costs for water service incurred by the 
39 municipality for the water used in connection with extinguishing a fire at a property owned 
40 or rented by the resident.31
