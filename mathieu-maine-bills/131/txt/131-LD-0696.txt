3 to read:
4 The State Auditor is the head of the Office of the State Auditor.  The State Auditor 
5 must be a certified public accountant or a college graduate with not less than 6 years of 
6 experience as a professional accountant or auditor, including not less than 5 years of 
7 auditing experience, of which not less than 4 years must have been in a supervisory 
8 capacity.  The Until 2024, the State Auditor must be elected by the Legislature by a joint 
9 ballot of the Senators and Representatives in convention and holds office for a term of 4 
10 years or until a successor is elected and qualified.  Beginning in 2024, the State Auditor is 
11 elected every 4 years in the same manner as is the Governor.  If a vacancy occurs, the 
12 Governor shall appoint a successor who is subject to confirmation in the same manner as 
13 Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court.  The State Auditor shall exercise such the powers 
14 and perform such the duties as are set forth in this chapter.  In case the office of State 
15 Auditor becomes vacant during a period when the Legislature is not in session, the 
16 appointment of a person to fill such vacancy must be made immediately by the President 
17 of the Senate or if that office is vacant, by the Speaker of the House, and the person 
18 appointed holds that office until such time as the Legislature meets in regular or special 
19 session, and either confirm the appointment of the person or chooses another person to fill 
20 the office during the unexpired term.
21Sec. 2.  5 MRSA §241, 2nd ¶, as amended by PL 2015, c. 44, §3, is further amended 
22 to read:

25 certified information systems auditor or certified internal auditor at the time of election and 
26 fails to become so qualified within 9 months of being sworn into office, as required by 
27 section 242, that person may no longer serve as State Auditor and is ineligible for reelection 
28 by the same Legislature and the office of State Auditor is deemed vacant.
