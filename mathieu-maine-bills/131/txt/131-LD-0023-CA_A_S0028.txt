SUMMARY 
The bill provides that personally identifying information that is located within the 
electronic citation database maintained, administered or contributed to by the Department 
of Public Safety, Bureau of State Police is confidential. This amendment, which is the 
majority report of the committee, provides similar protection to information in the bureau's 
electronic warnings database. It also clarifies that the bil1 does not prevent a law 
enforcement officer from sharing this information with another criminal justice agency, 
serving the Violation Summons and Complaint on the person charged with having 
committed the traffic infraction or transmitting the electronic Violation Summons and 
Complaint to the violations bureau of the District Court. Public access to violations bureau 
court records, including personally identifying information contained in a Violation 
Summons and Complaint, is governed by the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80F. 
The amendment also adds a definition of "personally identifying information."
