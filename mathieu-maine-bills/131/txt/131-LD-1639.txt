28 nurse in the calculation unless the nurse has the principal responsibility of providing direct

37 electronic monitoring, including, but not limited to, video monitoring or other remote

40 number of patients being treated in the facility resulting from circumstances such as

10 assign a direct-care registered nurse to relieve the originally assigned direct-care registered 
11 nurse for breaks, meals or other routine, expected absences only if the relieving nurse has 
12 demonstrated to the facility competency in providing care to patients in the patient care 
13 unit and received orientation to the unit sufficient to provide care to patients.

28 care registered nurse from acting as a patient advocate in the exclusive interests of the 
29 patient; or

12 (3)  Determine using the nurse's professional judgment whether acceptance of a 
13 patient assignment would expose the patient or direct-care registered nurse to the

17§1817.  Issuance of licenses
18 The department is authorized to issue licenses to operate hospitals, sanatoriums, 
19 convalescent homes, rest homes, nursing homes, ambulatory surgical facilities and other 
20 related institutions that, after inspection, are found to comply with this chapter, chapter 
21 404-A and any rules adopted by the department.  An initial license may be issued for up to 
22 12 months. A license may be renewed for up to 24 months.  The fee for this temporary or 
23 conditional license is $15 and is payable at the time of issuance of the license regardless of 
24 the term.  When an institution, upon inspection by the department, is found not to meet all 
25 requirements of this chapter or department rules, the department is authorized to issue 
26 either:
271.  Temporary license.  A temporary license for a specified period not to exceed 90 
28 days, during which time corrections specified by the department must be made by the 
29 institution for compliance with this chapter, chapter 404-A and departmental rules, if in the 
30 judgment of the commissioner the best interests of the public will be so served; or
312.  Conditional license.  A conditional license setting forth conditions that must be 
32 met by the institution to the satisfaction of the department.
33 Failure of the institution to meet any of the department's conditions immediately voids 
34 the temporary or conditional license by written notice by the department to the licensee or, 
35 if the licensee cannot be reached for personal service, by notice left at the licensed premises. 
36 A new application for a regular license may be considered by the department if, when and 
37 after the conditions set forth by the department at the time of the issuance of this temporary 
38 or conditional license have been met and satisfactory evidence of this fact has been 
39 furnished to the department. The department may amend, modify or refuse to renew a 
40 license in conformity with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, or file a complaint 
41 with the District Court requesting suspension or revocation of any license on any of the 
42 following grounds: violation of this chapter or the rules issued adopted pursuant to this 
43 chapter; violation of chapter 404-A or the rules adopted by the department pursuant to 1
2
Page 12 - 131LR0765(01)44 chapter 404-A; permitting, aiding or abetting the commission of any illegal act in that 
45 institution; or conduct of practices detrimental to the welfare of a patient. Whenever, on 
46 inspection by the department, conditions are found to exist that violate this chapter or 
47 department rules issued adopted pursuant to this chapter  or violate chapter 404-A or the 
48 rules adopted by the department pursuant to chapter 404-A that, in the opinion of the 
49 commissioner, immediately endanger the health or safety of patients in an institution or 
50 create an emergency, the department by its duly authorized agents may, under the 
51 emergency provisions of Title 4, section 184, subsection 6, request that the District Court 
52 suspend or revoke the license.  Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical 
53 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
11SUMMARY

13 registered nurse staffing assignments in health care facilities, including hospitals,

15 effective patient care.  It establishes minimum direct-care registered nurse staffing 
16 requirements based on patient care unit and patient needs, specifies the method to calculate 
17 a health care facility's compliance with the staffing requirements, protects direct-care 
18 registered nurses from retaliation and includes notice, record-keeping and enforcement 
19 requirements.1
