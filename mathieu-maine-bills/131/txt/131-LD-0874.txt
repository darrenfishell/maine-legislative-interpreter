Page 1 - 131LR0668(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not

3Whereas, a shortage of direct care workers has resulted in individuals, including 
4 children, who are eligible for in-home personal care services but are not receiving critical 
5 services; and
6Whereas, parents of children eligible for in-home personal care services are leaving 
7 paid employment to provide care in the absence of available direct care workers, resulting 
8 in economic hardship; and
9Whereas, this legislation requires the Department of Health and Human Services to 
10 submit a request for the necessary state plan amendment or Medicaid waiver from the 
11 Federal Government as soon after enactment as possible; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,

14SUMMARY

18 has passed a background check. The child must be eligible for the MaineCare program. An 
19 individual who is not a parent of the child must be designated as the employer and must be 
20 approved as the employer by both the parent and the Department of Health and Human 
21 Services. The department is required to request the necessary state plan amendments or
