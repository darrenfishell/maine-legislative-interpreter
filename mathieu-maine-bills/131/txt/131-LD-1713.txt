30SUMMARY
31 This bill amends the laws governing the licensing of electricians to eliminate 
32 unintended barriers for applicants seeking to complete the requisite electrical education 
33 needed to qualify to take an examination and requires the Electricians' Examining Board to 
34 establish in rule the minimum curriculum requirements for a program of study.  The board 
35 is not required to approve any individual program of study or accredited institution as long 
36 as the offered course of study meets the coursework requirements set forth in rule.
37 The bill reorganizes the current structure of the law regarding what is required in order 
38 for an applicant to qualify to take an examination and what is required at the stage the 
39 individual applies for a license after passage of an examination.
40 The bill clarifies that the board may require a person to first pass an examination 
41 approved by the board in order to obtain a limited electrician license.31
