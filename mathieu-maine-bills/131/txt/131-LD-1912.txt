24SUMMARY
25 This bill establishes the Maine Small Dollar Consumer Protection Act. It outlines the 
26 process for supervised lenders to offer small dollar loans, which are defined as loans not 
27 exceeding $2,500 that are unsecured and paid in substantially equal installments and that 
28 mature not less than 90 days or more than 365 days after the date of the agreement, and the 
29 rights that consumers have when entering into small dollar loan agreements.
30 It also repeals the provision that provides that a person is a lender subject to the 
31 requirements of the Maine Consumer Credit Code governing finance charges and related 
32 provisions notwithstanding the fact that the person purports to act as an agent or service 
33 provider or in another capacity for another entity that is exempt from the requirements of 
34 the Maine Consumer Credit Code governing finance charges and related provision if 
35 certain conditions are met.
36 It provides that the requirements of the Maine Consumer Credit Code governing 
37 finance charges and related provisions do not apply to a person doing business pursuant to 
38 any law of this State or of the United States relating to banks, national banking associations, 
39 savings banks, trust companies, savings and loan associations, credit unions or mortgage 
40 companies, including without limitation any affiliate, subsidiary or service provider of such 
41 a person, irrespective of whether or not such an affiliate, subsidiary or service provider is 
42 a bank.25
