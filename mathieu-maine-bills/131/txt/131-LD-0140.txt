Page 1 - 131LR0174(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA §3003, sub-§14, as amended by PL 2021, c. 326, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
414.  Juvenile.  "Juvenile" means a person who has not attained 18 years of age and a 
5 person 18 years of age or older during the period of a disposition that includes probation or 
6 commitment to a Department of Corrections juvenile facility who was adjudicated before 
7 18 years of age.  This definition does not apply to a person whose disposition includes 
8 probation or commitment to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facility 
9 when that person engages in new criminal conduct and is 18 years of age or older at the 
10 time of the new criminal conduct.
11Sec. 2.  15 MRSA §3203-A, sub-§4, ¶G, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 326, §2, is 
12 repealed.
13Sec. 3.  15 MRSA §3203-A, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2021, c. 326, §3, is further 
14 amended to read:
155.  Detention hearing.  Upon petition by a juvenile community corrections officer who 
16 ordered the detention or an attorney for the State who ordered the detention, the Juvenile 
17 Court shall review the decision to detain a juvenile within 48 hours following the detention, 
18 excluding Saturday, Sunday and legal holidays, except that if a juvenile is detained 
19 pursuant to subsection 7, paragraph B‑5, the Juvenile Court shall review the decision to 
20 detain the juvenile within 24 hours following the detention, excluding Saturday, Sunday 
21 and legal holidays.  When a petition to review detention is filed, the Juvenile Court shall 
22 assign counsel to represent the juvenile.  The assignment must be reviewed at the juvenile's 
23 first appearance before the Juvenile Court.  If a juvenile petition with charges based on the 
24 conduct at issue in the detention hearing is filed, the assignment continues with respect to 
25 the petition to review detention but must be reviewed at the juvenile's first appearance on 
26 the juvenile petition.
27 A.  A detention hearing must precede and must be separate from a bind-over or 
28 adjudicatory hearing.  Evidence presented at a detention hearing may include 
29 testimony, affidavits and other reliable hearsay evidence as permitted by the Juvenile 
30 Court and may be considered in making any determination in that hearing.
31 B.  Following a detention hearing, the Juvenile Court shall order a juvenile's release, 
32 in accordance with subsection 4, unless it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, 
33 that continued detention is necessary to meet one of the purposes of detention provided 
34 in that subsection.  The Juvenile Court shall ensure, by appropriate order, that any such 
35 continued detention is otherwise in accordance with the requirements of subsection 4.  
36 The Juvenile Court may order that detention be continued pending further appearances 
37 before the Juvenile Court or pending conditional release to a setting satisfactory to the 
38 juvenile community corrections officer.
39 C.  Continued detention or conditional release may not be ordered unless a Juvenile 
40 Court Judge or justice of the peace has determined pursuant to subsection 4‑A or the 
41 Juvenile Court determines at the detention hearing that there is probable cause to 
42 believe that the juvenile has committed a juvenile crime.
Page 2 - 131LR0174(01)1 D.  When the Juvenile Court orders detention or a conditional release that authorizes, 
2 even temporarily, the juvenile's removal from the juvenile's home, the Juvenile Court 
3 shall determine whether reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the 
4 need for removal of the juvenile from the juvenile's home or that no reasonable efforts 
5 are necessary because of the existence of an aggravating factor as defined in Title 22, 
6 section 4002, subsection 1‑B, and whether continuation in the juvenile's home would 
7 be contrary to the welfare of the juvenile.  This determination does not affect whether 
8 the Juvenile Court orders detention or a conditional release, which continues to be 
9 governed by the other provisions of this section.
10Sec. 4.  15 MRSA §3301, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2021, c. 326, §4, is further 
11 amended by repealing the 3rd blocked paragraph.

13 repealed.

15 amended by repealing the first blocked paragraph.
16Sec. 7.  15 MRSA §3313, sub-§2, ¶J, as amended by PL 2021, c. 326, §7, is further 
17 amended to read:
18 J.  The juvenile is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probation; and
19Sec. 8.  15 MRSA §3313, sub-§2, ¶K, as amended by PL 2021, c. 326, §8, is further 
20 amended to read:
21 K.  The confinement of the juvenile would entail excessive hardship to the juvenile or 
22 the juvenile's dependents; .
23Sec. 9.  15 MRSA §3313, sub-§2, ¶L, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 326, §9, is 
24 repealed.
25Sec. 10.  15 MRSA §3313, sub-§2, ¶M, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 326, §10, is 
26 repealed.
27Sec. 11.  15 MRSA §3314, sub-§1, ¶F, as amended by PL 2021, c. 326, §11, is 
28 further amended to read:
29 F.  The court may commit the juvenile to a Department of Corrections juvenile 
30 correctional facility, except that, beginning October 1, 2021, the juvenile must be at 
31 least 12 years of age at the time of commitment to be committed to such a facility.  
32 Whenever a juvenile is committed to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional 
33 facility, the court shall determine whether reasonable efforts have been made to prevent 
34 or eliminate the need for removal of the juvenile from the juvenile's home or that no 
35 reasonable efforts are necessary because of the existence of an aggravating factor as 
36 defined in Title 22, section 4002, subsection 1‑B and whether continuation in the 
37 juvenile's home would be contrary to the welfare of the juvenile.  This determination 
38 does not affect whether the court orders a commitment to a Department of Corrections 
39 juvenile correctional facility, which continues to be governed by section 3313.
40Sec. 12.  15 MRSA §3315, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2021, c. 326, §12, is further 
41 amended to read:
Page 3 - 131LR0174(01)13.  Court review of determination.  Whenever a court makes a determination pursuant 
2 to section 3314, subsection 1, paragraph F or section 3314, subsection 2 that reasonable 
3 efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the juvenile from 
4 the juvenile's home or that no reasonable efforts are necessary because of the existence of 
5 an aggravating factor as defined in Title 22, section 4002, subsection 1‑B and that 
6 continuation in the juvenile's home would be contrary to the welfare of the juvenile, that 
7 determination must be reviewed by the court not less than once every 12 months until the 
8 juvenile is discharged or , no longer residing resides outside the juvenile's home  or attains 
9 18 years of age.  This review does not affect a juvenile's commitment to a Department of 
10 Corrections juvenile correctional facility.
11 A.  A juvenile who has not attained 21 years of age must be represented by counsel at 
12 this review.
13 B.  If an appropriate treatment or appropriate and less restrictive placement is not being 
14 provided or offered to the juvenile, the court may order the Department of Corrections 
15 or the Department of Health and Human Services, or both, to demonstrate the 
16 reasonableness of the current treatment or placement provided or offered.
17Sec. 13.  15 MRSA §3316, sub-§2, ¶A, as amended by PL 2021, c. 326, §13, is 
18 further amended to read:
19 A.  A commitment of a juvenile to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional 
20 facility pursuant to section 3314 must be for an indeterminate period not to extend 
21 beyond the juvenile's 18th birthday unless the court expressly further limits or extends 
22 the indeterminate commitment, as long as the court does not limit the commitment to 
23 less than one year or extend the commitment beyond a juvenile's 21st birthday  and as 
24 long as an order does not result in a commitment of less than one year, unless the 
25 commitment is for an indeterminate period not to extend beyond the juvenile's 21st 
26 birthday.  Nothing in this Part may be construed to prohibit the provision to a juvenile 
27 following the expiration of the juvenile's term of commitment of services voluntarily 
28 accepted by the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or parents, guardian or legal custodian 
29 if the juvenile is not emancipated; except that these services may not be extended 
30 beyond the juvenile's 21st birthday.

32 to read:

38 designee, or the juvenile following the disposition may for good cause petition the Juvenile 
39 Court having original jurisdiction in the case for a judicial review of the disposition, 
40 including extension of the period of commitment or period of probation.  For a petition 
41 initiated by the juvenile, the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department 
42 of Corrections shall provide information including, but not limited to, the information in 
43 reports required for periodic review pursuant to section 3315.  In all cases in which the 
44 juvenile is returned to a Juvenile Court, the Juvenile Court may make any of the 
45 dispositions otherwise provided in section 3314 and Title 34‑A, section 3805, subsection 
Page 4 - 131LR0174(01)46 2.  When reviewing a commitment to the Department of Health and Human Services, the 
47 court shall consider efforts made by the Department of Corrections and the Department of 
48 Health and Human Services to reunify the juvenile with the juvenile's parents or custodians, 
49 shall make a finding regarding those efforts and shall return custody of the juvenile to a 
50 parent or legal custodian if the return of the juvenile is not contrary to the welfare of the 
51 juvenile.  A petition for judicial review of a disposition committing the juvenile to the 
52 Department of Health and Human Services must be served on the parents at least 7 days 
53 prior to the hearing.  Absent extraordinary circumstances, the juvenile may file a petition
