Page 1 - 131LR1754(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this Act needs to take effect prior to the expiration of the 90-day period 
4 because there is a shortage of housing available in the State, which makes it difficult to find 
5 alternative housing for occupants of residential dwelling units that are undergoing lead 
6 abatement activities that require the occupants to be displaced from their units; and
7Whereas, this Act authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to clear 
8 for occupancy one unit at a time in an owner-occupied residential building of 3 dwelling 
9 units or less that has been ordered to be cleared of harmful lead-based substances and from 
10 which the occupants have been displaced; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง1331 is enacted to read:
