12 for a motor vehicle other than a bicycle with motor attached, $2.50 for a bicycle with 
13 motor attached, $15 for a camper trailer other than a tent trailer and $5 for a tent trailer.  
14 The excise tax on a stock race car is $5.
15 (1)  On new registrations of automobiles, trucks and truck tractors, the excise tax 
16 payment must be made prior to registration and is for a one-year period from the 
17 date of registration.
18 (2)  Vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan are subject to an 
19 excise tax determined on a monthly proration basis if their registration period is 
20 less than 12 months.
21 (3)  For commercial vehicles manufactured in model year 1996 and after, the

23 pounds and for Class A special mobile equipment, as defined in Title 29‑A, section 
24 101, subsection 70, is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather 
25 than on the list price.  Verification of purchase price for the application of excise 
26 tax is determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided 
27 at point of purchase.  The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial 
28 purchaser of a new vehicle.
29 (4)  For buses manufactured in model year 2006 and after, the amount of excise

34 purchaser of a new vehicle.
35 (5)  For trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 26,000 pounds that have 
36 been reconstructed using a prepackaged kit that may include a frame, front axle or 
37 body but does not include a power train or engine and for which a new certificate 
38 of title is required to be issued, the amount of excise tax due is based on the maker's 
39 list price of the prepackaged kit.
40 For motor vehicles being registered pursuant to Title 29‑A, section 405, subsection 1, 
41 paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the 
42 registration.
