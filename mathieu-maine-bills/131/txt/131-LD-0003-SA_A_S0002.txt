This amendment changes the distribution of heating assistance from checks to fuel vouchers and changes the name of 
the program to the Winter Energy Relief Fuel Voucher Program. The vouchers will be for eligible households instead 
of individuals. The amount of allocation and the transfer from the General Fund remain at $398,000,000. The cost of 
the vouchers is anticipated to be approximately $315,000,000. The costs to design and implement a voucher system, 
including internal controls and verification, are expected to be significant and implementation by Maine Revenue 
Services in a short period of time may be difficult. As in the original bill, any balance remaining at the end of fiscal 
year 2023-24 will be transferred to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund.
