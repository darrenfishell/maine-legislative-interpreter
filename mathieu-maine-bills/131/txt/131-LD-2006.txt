Page 1 - 131LR2534(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §5681, sub-§2, ¶B, as amended by PL 2007, c. 662, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 B.  "Property tax burden" means the total real and personal property taxes assessed in 
5 the municipal fiscal year pertaining to the latest state valuation, except the taxes 
6 assessed on captured value within a tax increment financing district, divided by the 
7 latest state valuation certified to the Secretary of State. In the case of a municipality 
8 that qualifies for an adjustment for sudden and severe disruption of valuation under 
9 Title 36, section 208-A, the amount of money that municipality uses from undesignated 
10 fund balances in the municipal fiscal year must be added to the total real and personal 
11 property taxes assessed in each fiscal year that municipality qualifies for an adjustment 
12 in the determination of the property tax burden.
13Sec. 2.  30-A MRSA §5681, sub-§2, ¶E, as amended by PL 2011, c. 656, §1, is 
14 further amended to read:
15 E.  "Disproportionate tax burden" means the total real and personal property taxes 
16 assessed in the municipal fiscal year pertaining to the latest state valuation, except the 
17 taxes assessed on captured value within a tax increment financing district, divided by 
18 the latest state valuation certified to the Secretary of State and reduced by .01. In the 
19 case of a municipality that qualifies for an adjustment for sudden and severe disruption 
20 of valuation under Title 36, section 208-A, the amount of money that municipality uses 
21 from undesignated fund balances in the municipal fiscal year must be added to the total 
22 real and personal property taxes assessed in each fiscal year that municipality qualifies 
23 for an adjustment in the determination of the property tax burden. Beginning on July 
24 1, 2013 and each July 1st thereafter, if the total revenue-sharing distribution as 
25 calculated by subsection 5 is distributed to the municipalities without transfer or 
26 reduction, the reduction factor must be increased by either .0005 or the percentage 
27 increase necessary to equal the statewide average property tax rate, whichever increase 
28 is smaller, until the fiscal year when the percentage reduction factor reaches the 
29 statewide average property tax rate.
30SUMMARY
31 This bill provides that the amount of money that a municipality that qualifies for an 
32 adjustment for sudden and severe disruption of valuation uses from undesignated fund 
33 balances does not reduce the amount of money that municipality receives in state-municipal 
34 revenue sharing.31
