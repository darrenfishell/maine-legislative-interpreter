2 This bill provides for a tax credit for employers who employ persons recovering from 
3 substance use disorder who are completing or have successfully completed a substance use 
4 disorder treatment program certified by the Department of Health and Human Services.  
5 The Department of Health and Human Services is required to establish a certification 
6 process for employers.  A certified employer, in order to receive the tax credit, is required 
7 to apply to the State Tax Assessor for the tax credit.
8 The tax credit is available with respect to an employee who has been employed with 
9 the employer for at least 500 hours.  The credit is calculated by multiplying the number of 
10 hours, above the 500 hours from date of hire, worked by the employee by $1, except that 
11 the credit may not exceed $2,000 for each eligible employee.  The credit may be claimed 
12 only once per employee. The credit is further limited by a total allocation of credit of
