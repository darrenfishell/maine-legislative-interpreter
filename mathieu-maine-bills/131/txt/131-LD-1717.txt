14SUMMARY
15 Current law provides a $6,000 exemption from property taxes to veterans who served 
16 in the Armed Forces of the United States during a federally recognized war period once 
17 they reach the age of 62 years or are receiving a pension or compensation from the Federal 
18 Government for total disability as a veteran. Current law also provides that a veteran who 
19 is disabled by injury or disease incurred during active military service is eligible for the 
20 $6,000 exemption, regardless of when that service was performed.
21 This bill removes the requirement that the military service be performed during a 
22 federally recognized war period, allowing a veteran who is at least 62 years of age, 
23 regardless of when the military service was performed, to be eligible for the $6,000 
24 exemption.  A veteran who is receiving a pension or compensation from the Federal 
25 Government for a service-connected disability continues to be eligible for the $6,000 
26 exemption, regardless of age or time of service.15
