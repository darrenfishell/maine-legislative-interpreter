13 rail and airline services across time zones; residents who engage in work, education, 
14 recreation, health care or religious worship outside of the State's time zone; major elements 
15 of the State's economy; and any current federal, state or local plans for economic 
16 development.
17 Funding for the study must be through private donations to the University of Maine 
18 System, and the University of Maine System is not required under this resolve to undertake 
19 work for which it does not have or has not received sufficient resources.
