8 gubernatorial election, an election must be held to determine the recall of an elected 
9 member of a school board within that municipality.
102.  Notice of intention.  In order to initiate a recall election under subsection 1, the 
11 initiator of the petition shall file a notice of intention of recall with the municipal clerk of 
12 the municipality. A notice of intention of recall under this subsection must include the 
13 name, address and contact information of the person filing the notice and the name of the 
14 school board member subject to recall under this section. Only a person registered to vote 
15 in the municipality in which the school board member was elected may file a notice of 
16 intention of recall under this subsection.
173.  Petition forms.  Within 3 business days of receipt of a notice of intention of recall 
18 under subsection 2, the municipal clerk shall prepare petition forms for the collection of 
19 signatures under subsection 4 and send notice to the initiator of the petition under 
20 subsection 2 that the petition forms are available. The municipality may charge the initiator 
21 of the petition a reasonable fee for preparing and providing the petition forms under this 
22 subsection. A petition form under this subsection must include:
23 A.  At the top of the form, the name of the school board member subject to recall, the 
24 name and contact information of the initiator of the petition and the date by which the 
25 signatures must be submitted to the municipal clerk under subsection 4;
26 B.  Spaces for each voter's signature, actual street address and printed name; and
27 C.  Space at the bottom of the form for the name, address and signature of the person 
28 circulating the petition form.
294.  Collection and submission of signatures.  A petition form under subsection 3 may

32 required under subsection 3, paragraph C and sign the form prior to submission of the form 
33 to the municipal clerk. The initiator of the petition under subsection 2 shall collect the 
34 petition forms from all circulators and submit the signed petition forms to the municipal 
35 clerk within 14 days of receipt of notice from the clerk that the petition forms are available 
36 under subsection 3. A municipal clerk may not accept a petition form submitted more than 
37 14 days after sending notice of availability to the initiator under subsection 3, and any voter 
38 signatures on that form are invalid.
395.  Petition certification and notification.  Within 7 business days of receiving 
40 petition forms under subsection 4, the municipal clerk shall determine whether the petition

45 officers, the initiator of the petition and the school board member subject to the recall. If

47 not meet the requirements for a petition under subsection 1, the municipal clerk shall file 
48 the petition and the petition forms in the clerk's office and notify the initiator of the petition.
66.  Scheduling recall election.  Within 10 business days of certification of the petition 
7 under subsection 5, the municipal officers shall schedule a recall election to determine 
8 whether the school board member subject to the recall petition should be recalled.  The 
9 election must be held no less than 45 days nor more than 75 days after certification of the 
10 petition under subsection 5 unless a regular municipal election is scheduled to be held 
11 within 90 days of the certification of the petition under subsection 5, in which case the 
12 recall election must be held on the date of the regular municipal election. If the municipal 
13 officers fail to schedule a recall election within 10 days of certification of the recall petition 
14 under subsection 5, the municipal clerk shall schedule the recall election pursuant to the 
15 date requirements of this subsection.
167.  Ballots for recall election.  If the school board member subject to the recall does 
17 not resign from the member's position within 10 business days of certification of the recall 
18 petition under subsection 5, the ballots for the recall election under subsection 6 must be 
19 printed. A ballot for a recall election under this section must read: 
20 "Do you authorize the recall of (name of school board member) from the (school unit) 
21 school board?
22 Yes        No"
238.  Results of recall election.  Within 2 business days of a recall election under 
24 subsection 6, the municipal clerk shall certify and record the election results and notify the 
25 municipal officers of those results. If a majority of voters vote to remove the school board 
26 member, the recall takes effect on the date the election results are recorded pursuant to this 
27 subsection.
