2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §7402, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 398, Pt. AAAA, §1, is 
3 amended to read:
41.  At least 125% of the minimum wage.  An amount equal to at least 125% of the 
5 minimum wage established in Title 26, section 664, subsection 1 for the labor portion of 
6 the reimbursement rate.  An increase to the minimum wage must be applied to the 
7 reimbursement rate at the time the increase takes place; and
8Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §7402, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 398, Pt. AAAA, §1, is 
9 amended to read:
102.  Taxes and benefits.  An amount necessary to reimburse the provider for taxes and 
11 benefits paid or costs incurred by the provider that are directly related to the reimbursed 
12 wage increase in subsection 1.  This amount must be adjusted whenever an increase to the 
13 minimum wage is applied to the reimbursement rate under subsection 1.
14Sec. 3.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§1, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, §1, is further 
15 amended to read:
161.  Minimum wage.  The minimum hourly wage is $7.50 per hour.  Starting January 
17 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2018, the 
18 minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, the minimum hourly 
19 wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum hourly wage is $12.00  
20 $13.80 per hour.  On January 1, 2021 and each January 1st thereafter, the minimum hourly 
21 wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost of living. The 
22 increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, if any, as of 
23 August of the previous year over the level as of August of the year preceding that year in 
24 the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for the 
25 Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the United States Department of 
26 Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount of the minimum 
27 wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.   If the highest federal minimum wage 
28 is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect under this section, the minimum wage 
29 under this section is increased to the same amount, effective on the same date as the 
30 increase in the federal minimum wage, and must be increased in accordance with this 
31 section thereafter.
32Sec. 4.  36 MRSA §5217-E, sub-§1, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 635, Pt. H, §15,

35 as set out in Title 26, section 664, subsection 1, as adjusted for cost-of-living 
36 increases, as determined on January 1st of the taxable year, multiplied by 936 
37 hours.  The assessor may adopt rules reducing this amount if a portion of the 
38 taxable year falls within a disaster period. Rules adopted pursuant to this 
39 subparagraph are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, 
40 subchapter 2‑A.
Page 2 - 131LR0602(01)1SUMMARY
