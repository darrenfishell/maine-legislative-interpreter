This bill changes the defimt10n of "metallic mineral" to exclude certam activities from the defimt10n of "mmmg" m 
the Mame Metallic Mineral Mmmg Act (MMMMA), allowmg them to continue to be conducted unde1 site location 
or quarry rules issued by the Department of Env1ronmental Protection (DEP) The bill creates a process for 
mdividuals to request a detenmnat10n from DEP that certam activities related to the defimt10n of "metallic mmeral" 
01 "mmmg" are exempt from prov1S1ons of the MMMMA, but are subJ ect to the prov1S1ons of rules govemmg site

This bill will mcrease Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the DEP from new site location or quarry penmts 
issued If applicants are approved, mmmg excise tax revenues would be received Under current statute, the revenue 
will reunburse mumcipahties and unorgamzed temtones for at least 50%, and 1f sufficiently available 100%, of the 
p1 operty tax revenue loss suffered by that mumc1pahty or unorgamzed temtory as a result of property tax exempt10ns 
created undei the mmmg excise tax statute 25% of any remammg revenues would be paid to DEP for oversight of 
mmmg activity and 75% would be credited to the General Fund
