12 requires the written consent of all owners of an interest in a parcel except for the State.  For 
13 applications submitted on or after August 1, 2012, the size of the exclusion from 
14 classification under this subchapter for each structure located on the parcel and for each 
15 residential structure located on the parcel in shoreland areas is determined pursuant to 
16 section 574‑C.

303.  Transfer of ownership.  When land taxed under this subchapter is transferred to a 
31 new owner, within one year of the date of transfer, the new landowner must file with the
