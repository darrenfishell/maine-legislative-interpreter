33§1164.  Special Administrative Expense Fund
34 The Special Administrative Expense Fund is created as a special fund in the State 
35 Treasury.  All interest, fines and penalties collected under this chapter and all voluntary 
36 contributions tendered as a contribution to this fund must be paid into this fund.  The money 
37 may not be expended or available for expenditure in any manner that would permit its 
38 substitution for, or a corresponding reduction in, federal funds that would in the absence of 
39 that money be available to finance expenditures for the administration of the Employment 
40 Security Law  Reemployment Assistance Program.  Nothing in this section prevents the 
41 money from being used as a revolving fund to cover expenditures, necessary and proper 
Page 2 - 131LR2393(01)42 under the law, for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, 
43 subject to the charging of those expenditures against those funds when received.  The 
44 money in this fund must be used by the commissioner either for the payment of costs of 
45 administration that are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against 
46 federal grants or other funds received for or in the Employment Security Administration 
47 Fund on or after January 1, 1943, to finance the Maine Wage Assurance Fund established 
48 in section 632; for the payment of costs of administering chapter 26, for which federal 
49 funds are not available; or to fund activities that will improve the solvency of the 
50 Unemployment Compensation Fund.  The money must be available either to satisfy the 
51 obligations incurred by the bureau directly or by requesting the Treasurer of State to 
52 transfer the required amount from the Special Administrative Expense Fund to the 
53 Employment Security Administration Fund or the Maine Wage Assurance Fund.  The 
54 Treasurer of State shall upon receipt of a written request of the commissioner make any 
55 such transfer.  The commissioner shall give notice to the commission prior to any 
56 expenditures from this fund.  The commissioner shall order the transfer of the funds or the 
57 payment of any such obligation and the funds must be paid by the Treasurer of State on 
58 requisitions drawn by the commissioner directing the State Controller to issue the State 
59 Controller's warrant for them.  The warrant must be drawn by the State Controller based 
60 upon bills of particulars and vouchers certified by an officer or employee designated by the 
61 commissioner.  The money in this fund is specifically made available to replace, within a 
62 reasonable time, any money received by this State pursuant to section Section 302 of the 
63 Federal Social Security Act as amended that, because of any action or contingency, has 
64 been lost or has been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those 
65 necessary for the proper administration of the Employment Security Law  Reemployment 
66 Assistance Program.  The money in this fund must be continuously available to the 
67 commissioner for expenditure in accordance with this section and may not lapse at any time 
68 or be transferred to any other fund except as provided.  Any money in the Special 
69 Administrative Expense Fund may be used to make refunds of interest, penalties or fines 
70 erroneously collected and deposited in the Special Administrative Expense Fund.  On June 
71 30th of each year all money in excess of $100,000 in this fund must be transferred to the 
72 Unemployment Compensation Fund.

28 or rights to the amounts paid by the employer into the fund. Benefits paid to an eligible 
29 individual under the Employment Security Law Reemployment Assistance Program
