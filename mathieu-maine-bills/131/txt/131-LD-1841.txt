29 accounts under section 6997 are established for children within that school administrative 
30 unit.  The amount of the reduction must equal the total state subsidy that is attributable to

33SUMMARY
34 This bill establishes the Hope and Inclusion Scholarship Program administered by the 
35 Hope and Inclusion Scholarship Board.  The board is directed to establish hope accounts 
36 that may be used by the parents or legal guardians of qualified students to pay for the 
37 education of those students enrolled in private schools.  The funding for these hope 
38 accounts comes from shifting 90% of the essential programs and services funding that 
39 would otherwise be provided by the State and by the school administrative unit for each 
40 qualified student into a hope account.  The bill specifies which educational expenditures 
41 are permitted and provides for review of spending from the accounts.34
