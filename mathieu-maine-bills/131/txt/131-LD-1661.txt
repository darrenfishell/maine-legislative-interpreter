2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §1861, as amended by PL 2019, c. 299, §1, is further amended 
3 to read:
4§1861.  Holding vehicle and its accessories
5 A person holding or storing an abandoned vehicle, holding or storing a vehicle towed 
6 at the request of the vehicle's operator, owner or owner's agent or holding or storing a 
7 vehicle stored at the request of a law enforcement officer may hold the vehicle and all its 
8 accessories, contents and equipment, not including the personal effects of the registered 
9 owner, until reasonable towing and storage charges of the person holding or storing the 
10 vehicle are paid, except that a person may not hold the perishable cargo of a commercial 
11 motor vehicle, as defined in 49 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 390.5, as amended, when 
12 the perishable cargo being transported in interstate or intrastate commerce is not owned by 
13 the motor carrier or driver of the commercial motor vehicle being held and the person 
14 holding or storing the towed vehicle is presented with evidence of insurance, as defined in 
15 section 1551, covering the commercial motor vehicle and the vehicle's cargo.  For purposes 
16 of this paragraph, "perishable cargo" means cargo of a commercial motor vehicle that is 
17 subject to spoilage or decay or is marked with an expiration date. The reasonable towing 
18 and storage charges of the person holding or storing the vehicle must be covered by the 
19 liability automobile insurance policy of the owner of the vehicle.
20 For purposes of this section, "personal effects" includes medications, medical 
21 equipment, clothing, mail, child restraint systems and similar items.  Except for child 
22 restraint systems, items attached to the vehicle and business equipment, machinery and 
23 tools are not considered personal effects.  For the purposes of this section, "child restraint 
24 system" has the same meaning as in section 2081, subsection 1, paragraph A‑2.
25SUMMARY
26 This bill provides that the reasonable towing and storage charges of a person holding 
27 or storing a vehicle must be covered by the liability automobile insurance policy of the 
28 owner of the vehicle.26
