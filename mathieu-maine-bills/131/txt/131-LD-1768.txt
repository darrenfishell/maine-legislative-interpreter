Page 1 - 131LR0925(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, Public Law 2021, chapter 747 provides that an alternative payment method 
4 may be used for MaineCare reimbursement of services delivered by federally qualified 
5 health centers, which is based on 2018 and 2019 costs of providing services, instead of the 
6 federal system, which is based on 1999 and 2000 costs; and
7Whereas, the rebased alternative payment rates described above will not continue to 
8 fairly reflect the costs of services paid for under this method unless the base year for the 
9 rates is updated regularly; and
10Whereas, federally qualified health centers in the State have identified potential 
11 inadequacies in the extent to which rebased rates will fully recognize increased costs 
12 associated with workforce shortages and prevailing wage rates; and
13Whereas, the inadequacy of MaineCare reimbursement rates for services delivered 
14 by federally qualified health centers will not be fully addressed unless the Department of 
15 Health and Human Services is directed to address them and any contrary provisions of 
16 existing law are revised accordingly; and
17Whereas, to preserve and improve the advanced primary care model pioneered by 
18 federally qualified health centers in Maine, MaineCare payments for those services must 
19 be increased in order to reflect the current costs of providing services, as a foundation for 
20 developing a value-based payment model for federally qualified health centers; and
21Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
22 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
23 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
24 therefore,
25Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
26Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3174-V, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 747, §2, is amended 
27 to read:
283.  Updated base year option.  No later than March 1, 2023, the department shall 
29 provide an alternative, updated prospective payment method for each federally qualified 
30 health center that is the same as the prospective payment system set forth in 42 United 
31 States Code, Section 1396a(bb)(3), except that the base year for determining the costs of 
32 providing services must be the average of the reasonable costs incurred in the center's fiscal 
33 years ending in 2018 and 2019, adjusted for any change changes in scope  adjustments 
34 approved since the base year and for inflation measured by the federally qualified health 
35 center market basket percentage published by the United States Department of Health and 
36 Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  Each federally qualified 
37 health center must be given the option to be reimbursed under the method provided by this 
38 subsection or under the method provided by federal law. After December 31, 2023  No later 
39 than June 30, 2026, and no less frequently than every 3 years thereafter, the department 
40 may shall update the base year described in this subsection to a more recent base year.  In 
41 selecting the fiscal years to be averaged to update the base year, the department shall 
42 exclude years affected by a declared public health emergency or shall adjust the actual costs 
Page 2 - 131LR0925(01)43 and volume in a year affected by a public health emergency to correct for the impact of the 
44 emergency on cost and volume of services.
3Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §3174-V, sub-§3-A is enacted to read:
43-A.  Wage costs and workforce conditions.  The department may increase rates 
5 established in accordance with subsection 3 to reflect prevailing wage rates to the extent 
6 that prevailing wage rates are not adequately included in rates established in accordance 
7 with subsection 3, through inflation adjustments or updated base years or both, and to 
8 reflect additional expenditures needed to address workforce shortages.
9Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
10 takes effect when approved.
11SUMMARY
12 This bill provides that:
13 1.  After implementing the alternative payment method for federally qualified health 
14 centers similar to the prospective payment system required by federal law but using an 
15 updated base year, the Department of Health and Human Services must further update the 
16 base year of that alternative system no later than June 30, 2026, and no less frequently than 
17 every 3 years thereafter; and
18 2.  The department may also adjust rates determined under the alternative payment 
19 method as needed to reflect prevailing wage rates and workforce shortages.1
