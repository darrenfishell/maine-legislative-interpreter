Page 1 - 131LR0584(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current law requires, beginning July 1, 2023, all municipalities to allow a 
4 certain number of dwelling units under certain circumstances and the construction of 
5 accessory dwelling units on the same lot as a single-family dwelling unit and to comply 
6 with certain other zoning requirements; and
7Whereas, this legislation proposes to limit those requirements to municipalities with 
8 a population over 10,000; and
9Whereas, it is the intent of this legislation to exempt municipalities with a population 
10 of 10,000 or less from these requirements entirely;
11Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect prior to the end of the 90-day period so 
12 that municipalities with a population of 10,000 or less will not be subject to those 
13 requirements between July 1, 2023 and the end of the 90-day period; and
