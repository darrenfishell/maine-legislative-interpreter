16 A.  "Absentee voting period" means the time period beginning on the first date that 
17 absentee ballots are issued by the municipality and ending at 8 p.m. on election day.
18 B.  "Secured drop box" means a device containing a slot or chute through which an 
19 absentee voter may deposit an absentee ballot into a secure, locked collection box in 
20 accordance with the requirements of this section.
212.  Secured drop boxes authorized  prohibited.  A municipality may obtain and install 
22 not use a secured drop box  that meets the requirements of this section.  The secured drop 
23 box may be used by voters who are authorized to return absentee ballots in a secured drop 
24 box pursuant to section 754‑A, subsection 1, paragraph D.
253.  Location and number of secured drop boxes.  The secured drop box must be 
26 located outside the municipal office building or the building where in-person absentee 
27 voting takes place before an election.  If the secured drop box is positioned within or against 
28 an outside wall of the municipal office building, it must be bolted or otherwise securely 
29 fastened to the wall or to the deck or landing to prevent its removal by an unauthorized 
30 person.  Otherwise, the secured drop box must be securely affixed to a post that is sunk into 
31 the ground, affixed to a post that is set into a concrete pad or bolted or otherwise securely 
32 affixed to a platform or other structure in a manner that prevents removal of the drop box 
33 by an unauthorized person.
34 A municipality may seek approval from the Secretary of State to obtain and install an 
35 additional secured drop box or boxes at other locations within the municipality by 
36 certifying to the Secretary of State at least 90 days before the election that the additional 
37 secured drop box or boxes meet all of the requirements of this section, other than the 
38 requirement that the secured drop box be located outside of the municipal office building 
39 or the building where in-person absentee voting takes place before an election.
404.  Secured drop box design; accessibility.  The slot or chute of a secured drop box

42 the contents of the secure collection box and to protect the contents of the secure collection 
Page 2 - 131LR2301(01)43 box from the elements.  The secured drop box must include a mechanism to close and lock 
44 the slot or chute in a manner that prevents the deposit of additional absentee ballots at 8 
45 p.m. on election day as provided in subsection 8.  A secured drop box must comply with 
46 guidelines issued by the Secretary of State to ensure accessibility to individuals with 
47 disabilities.
65.   Monitoring of secured drop box.  During the absentee voting period, each secured 
7 drop box must be monitored periodically by law enforcement personnel, municipal staff or 
8 a surveillance camera.
96.  Labeling of secured drop box.  A secured drop box must be labeled, or a sign must 
10 be posted on or near the secured drop box, to indicate that it is an official secured drop box 
11 for the return of absentee ballots.  Unless the secured drop box is affixed to the outside wall 
12 of the municipal office building, the label or sign must include the name of the 
13 municipality.  A municipality may include on the label or sign instructions for voters 
14 regarding absentee voting requirements and warnings against use of the secured drop box 
15 by voters of other municipalities.
167.  Use and access during absentee voting period.  The secured drop box must be 
17 used only for the return of absentee ballots and not for the deposit of other municipal office 
18 filings during the absentee voting period.  During the absentee voting period, only the 
19 municipal clerk or designees under subsection 8 may possess the key to the secured drop 
20 box or have access to the contents of the secured collection box.  If items other than returned 
21 absentee ballots are deposited in the secured drop box during the absentee voting period, 
22 the municipal clerk or designees shall deliver those items to the appropriate municipal 
23 official.
248.  Periodic retrieval of ballots.  During the absentee voting period, the municipal 
25 clerk or a team of 2 people designated by the clerk shall periodically remove absentee 
26 ballots from each secured drop box and deliver the absentee ballots to the clerk's office to 
27 be stored in a secure manner.  At a minimum, absentee ballots must be removed from each 
28 secured drop box by the clerk or team of 2 designees:
29 A.  At least once on each day that the clerk's office is open during the absentee voting 
30 period;
31 B.  At all additional times necessary to ensure that additional absentee ballots deposited 
32 in the secured drop box fit within the secured collection box and are not accessible to 
33 unauthorized persons; and
34 C.  At 8 p.m. on election day.  
35 The identity of the persons who remove the absentee ballots from each secured drop box 
36 and the date and time that the absentee ballots are removed must be recorded on a form 
37 designed by the Secretary of State and initialed or signed by the clerk or team of 2 designees 
38 who removed the absentee ballots.
399.   Locking of secured drop boxes when polls close.  The municipal clerk or team of 
40 2 designees under subsection 8 shall lock the secured drop box at 8 p.m. on election day to 
41 prevent the deposit of additional absentee ballots in the secured drop box.
