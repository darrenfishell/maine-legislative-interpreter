21 to provide that, unless the intent of a transferor is to avoid the objectives of those laws, the 
22 division of a tract or parcel of land accomplished by the transfer of any interest in the land 
23 to a holder does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of that definition if:

26 conservation purposes: retaining or protecting the natural, scenic or open space values of 
27 the land; ensuring the availability of the land for agricultural, forest, recreational or open 
28 space use; protecting natural resources; or maintaining or enhancing air quality or water 
29 quality; and
