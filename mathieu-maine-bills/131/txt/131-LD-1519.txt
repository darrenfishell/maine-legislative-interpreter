28SUMMARY
29 This bill amends provisions in the motor vehicle laws regarding operating under the 
30 influence, or OUI, as follows.
31 1.  Under the current motor vehicle laws, a person commits criminal OUI if the person 
32 operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants or while having an alcohol 
33 level of 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters of breath.  
34 This bill provides that, if that alcohol level is established using a self-contained breath-
35 alcohol apparatus test and not through chemical analysis, the threshold for criminal OUI is 
36 an alcohol level of 0.09 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters 
37 of breath.  The threshold remains at 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of 
38 blood or 210 liters of breath if established through chemical analysis.  The bill incorporates 
39 this distinction in other motor vehicle laws relating to criminal OUI.
40 2.  Under current law, the license of a person with 2 OUI offenses may be reinstated 
41 after 9 months of a suspension period has been served if the person installs an ignition 
42 interlock device approved by the Secretary of State in the motor vehicle the person operates 29
30
Page 4 - 131LR1835(01)43 for the length of suspension time remaining.  This bill allows for such a person's license to 
44 be reinstated after 2 months of a suspension period has been served subject to the 
45 installation of an ignition interlock device.
4 3.  The bill provides that a person whose license has been reinstated subject to the 
5 installation of an ignition interlock device may petition the Secretary of State for and the 
6 secretary may approve a modification of imposed conditions due to special circumstances 
7 involving the health care needs of the person or the geographic location of the person's 
8 place of residence.1
