18 (2) Suing the patient or patient guarantor or enforcing an arbitration or mediation

24 section 11002, subsection 6.
25 C.  "Consumer reporting agency" means any person that, for monetary fees, dues, or 
26 on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages, in whole or in part, in the practice

28 consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to 3rd parties. "Consumer

42 and the hospital initiates a collection action against the patient or patient guarantor, the 
43 patient or patient guarantor may file an action in Superior Court or District Court for relief 
44 in accordance with subsection 3. The hospital may not further pursue a collection action 
45 against the patient or patient guarantor while the action is pending.
