4§711.  Joint use of equipment
51.  Joint use permitted.  The commission  authority may order that joint use be 
6 permitted and prescribe reasonable compensation and reasonable terms and conditions for 
7 the joint use when, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint of a joint 
8 use entity affected, it finds the following:
9 A.  That public convenience and necessity require a joint use entity to provide 
10 nondiscriminatory access to any poles, ducts, conduits or rights-of-way owned or 
11 controlled by another joint use entity;
12 B.  That joint use will not result in irreparable injury to the owner or other users of the 
13 poles, ducts, conduits or rights-of-way or in any substantial detriment to the service;
14 C.  That the joint use entities have failed to agree upon the use or the terms and 
15 conditions or compensation for the use; and
16 D.  That the joint use entity seeking access to the poles, ducts, conduits or rights-of-
17 way owned or controlled by another joint use entity has the technical and financial 
18 capabilities to fulfill its obligations related to such joint use.
192.  Liability of user.  If joint use is ordered, the joint use entity to whom the use is 
20 permitted is liable to the owner or other users of the poles, ducts, conduits or rights-of-way 
21 for damage that may result from its use to the property of the owner or other users.
223.  Interests of customers.  Any actions taken or orders issued by the commission  
23 authority under this section must take into account the interests of the customers of the

18Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §2311, as amended by PL 2001, c. 608, §1, is further amended 
19 to read:
20§2311.  Lines along railroads; application to Public Utilities Commission when 
21disagreement
22 A person maintaining or operating a telephone or electric line may construct a line 
23 across, upon or along any railroad with the written permit of the person owning or operating 
24 the railroad.  If the person maintaining or operating a telephone or electric line and the 
25 person owning or operating the railroad can not agree as to the construction or manner of 
26 construction of lines upon, along or across the railroad or as to the continued operation of 
27 lines constructed upon, along or across the railroad, either party may apply to the 
28 commission, who, after notice to those interested, shall hear and determine the matter.  The 
29 commission's decision is binding upon the parties.  The commission may grant the person 
30 seeking to construct or operate a line a permit with appropriate terms and conditions to 
31 construct or operate the line along, upon or across the railroad or, in the case of a line across 
32 the railroad, authorize, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, the person to take by 
33 eminent domain an easement across the railroad.  The taking of an easement authorized by 
34 the commission pursuant to this section must be in accordance with the procedures 
35 established in chapter 65.  This section does not permit the commission to authorize the 
36 taking of an easement over lands owned by the State.  The person seeking to construct lines 
37 on the railroad shall pay the expenses of the hearing, except that if the commission finds 
38 that parties owning or operating the railroad have unreasonably refused their consent, those 
39 parties shall pay the expenses.  Without limiting the commission's jurisdiction under this 
40 section, if a railroad company and a telephone or transmission and distribution utility enter 
41 into an agreement involving a utility crossing of railroad property and that agreement or 
42 some other agreement provides that the commission shall resolve disputes arising under 
43 the original agreement, the commission may resolve those disputes.  As used in this section, 
44 the term "railroad" includes, but is not limited to, a railroad whose abandonment has been 
Page 3 - 131LR0914(01)45 approved pursuant to 49 United States Code, Chapter 109. This section does not apply to a 
46 broadband service provider under section 9411.

5§2523.  Street lights; use of poles
6 This section governs street lights that are attached to utility poles in the public way. 
7 For purposes of this section, "authority" means the ConnectMaine Authority under section 
8 9203.
91.  Ownership and maintenance options.  On or after October 1, 2014, a transmission 
10 and distribution utility shall provide the following options to municipalities for street and 
11 area lighting provided by light fixtures attached to poles owned by the transmission and 
12 distribution utility or on shared-use poles in the electrical space under the contractual 
13 management of the transmission and distribution utility located in the public way:
14 A.  The transmission and distribution utility provides all of the components of the street 
15 lighting system, including installation on the utility poles and maintenance, and 
16 provides electricity delivery to the street lighting system from a power vendor selected 
17 by the municipality. The transmission and distribution utility shall apply a monthly 
18 charge for these services as approved by the commission that reflects the total cost to 
19 provide street lighting equipment for each light and a separate charge for power 
20 delivery consistent with subsection 3;
21 B.  The transmission and distribution utility installs all of the components of the street 
22 lighting hardware as selected, purchased and owned by the municipality on utility poles 
23 owned by the transmission and distribution utility or in the electrical space under 
24 contractual management of the transmission and distribution utility on shared-use poles 
25 and connects the light to the power source on the pole. The transmission and 
26 distribution utility may apply a one-time charge per light fixture for installation as 
27 established by the commission  authority.
28 Any repairs made by the transmission and distribution utility to the mounting hardware 
29 or the power supply wire connection following installation must be billed at a rate 
30 established by the commission  authority.  Maintenance of all components of the light 
31 fixture is the responsibility of the municipality or its contractor.  Any person 
32 performing maintenance work on behalf of the municipality pursuant to this provision 
33 must be qualified pursuant to applicable federal or state standards or any standards 
34 established by the commission  authority for such work and must have liability 
35 insurance in an amount and with terms determined by the commission  authority.  Light 
36 locations, the street lighting hardware installed and delivery charges are governed by 
37 subsections 2 and 3; and
38 C.  The transmission and distribution utility connects to the power lines a light fixture 
39 either owned by or owned and installed by the municipality or its contractor on a pole 
40 owned by the transmission and distribution utility or on a shared-use pole in the 
41 electrical space under the contractual management of the transmission and distribution 
42 utility.  Light locations, the street lighting hardware installed and delivery charges are 
43 governed by subsections 2 and 3.  Maintenance of the light fixture and mounting 
44 hardware is the responsibility of the municipality or its contractor.  Any person 1
2
Page 4 - 131LR0914(01)45 installing or working on municipally owned street lighting equipment pursuant to this 
46 paragraph on behalf of the municipality must be qualified pursuant to applicable federal 
47 and state standards or any standards established by the commission  authority for such 
48 work and must have liability insurance in an amount and with terms determined by the 
49 commission  authority.  The transmission and distribution utility may apply a one-time 
50 power connection charge per light fixture as established by the commission  authority.
72.  Lighting location and installation.  For municipally owned street lighting 
8 hardware located on poles owned by the transmission and distribution utility or in the 
9 electrical space under the contractual management of the transmission and distribution 
10 utility on shared-use poles in the public way, the location on the pole and the street lighting 
11 hardware installed, as well as any associated charges, are governed by the following 
12 provisions.
13 A.  The commission  authority shall establish criteria, based on standard utility industry 
14 practice, for determining possible locations on the utility pole for the street lighting 
15 hardware, determining any changes that may be needed, including, but not limited to, 
16 relocating equipment already on the pole, installing a taller pole or bracing an existing 
17 pole, as well as determining any one-time fees the transmission and distribution utility 
18 may charge the municipality for making the determinations and undertaking the work 
19 necessitated by the determinations.  The criteria must also specify the conditions under 
20 which a request from a municipality to locate a light fixture on a pole may reasonably 
21 be denied by the transmission and distribution utility.
22 B.  The commission  authority shall establish basic criteria, consistent with standard 
23 utility industry practice, for municipally owned street lighting hardware installed on 
24 utility poles that address any reasonable safety and compatibility issues with other 
25 equipment on or uses of the pole.  The criteria must provide a basis for determining 
26 when no additional assessment work, and related fees pursuant to paragraph A, would 
27 be warranted for a replacement light fixture because the new light fixture places 
28 comparable or lower demands on the utility pole and related utility equipment than the 
29 light fixture being replaced.
303.  Delivery rates and associated charges.  The commission shall establish through 
31 appropriate proceedings the charges for the transmission and distribution utility to deliver 
32 electricity to the municipal street lighting systems as provided in subsection 1.  For 
33 municipal street lighting system options described in subsection 1, paragraphs B and C, the 
34 commission shall determine what, if any, ongoing fees beyond the power-only delivery 
35 charge may be assessed, including  except a pole attachment fee , which is determined by 
36 the authority under section 711, subsection 4.  In making this determination, the 
37 commission shall weigh, among other factors, the municipal interest to serve the general 
38 public and the location of the poles in municipal rights-of-way.
394.  Transfer of ownership.  A transmission and distribution utility shall allow a 
40 municipality to transfer utility-owned street and area lighting for which the municipality is 
41 billed to either form of municipal ownership in subsection 1, paragraphs B and C in a time 
42 frame and under terms established by the commission  authority.  The  commission  authority 
43 shall also determine a fair and equitable cost for all aspects of the transfer and establish 
44 guidelines to best enable the contiguous ownership of lighting fixtures.

27SUMMARY
28 This bill directs that the ConnectMaine Authority be responsible for the management 
29 and administration of attachments to and joint use of utility poles. The bill also establishes 
30 a procedure by which broadband service providers that need to cross a railroad track with 
31 broadband infrastructure may apply to a railroad company, provides for responsibility of 
32 costs in the crossing by the broadband service provider and provides for payment of a 
33 license fee and reimbursement of expenses to the railroad company. The bill also 
34 establishes procedures for either the railroad company or the broadband service provider to 
35 petition the Public Utilities Commission if the railroad company and broadband service 
36 provider cannot agree on the terms of the crossing of the railroad track.28
