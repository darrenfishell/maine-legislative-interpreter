Page 1 - 131LR2332(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA ยง487-A, sub-ยง5 is enacted to read:
35.  Nonessential transmission lines; reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.  
4 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a permit issued under this article for 
5 a nonessential transmission line is conditioned on the owner of the transmission line, no 
6 later than one year after the transmission line achieves commercial operation, submitting 
7 to the department documentation, analysis or other information, prepared by an 
8 independent 3rd party, that demonstrates to the department's satisfaction that the 
9 transmission line and the electricity it transports contributes to the reduction of global 
10 greenhouse gas emissions.  As used in this subsection, "nonessential transmission line" 
11 means a permanently installed transmission line carrying 100 kilovolts or more that is 
12 constructed primarily to transport electricity generated outside of the State and that 
13 achieves commercial operation after January 1, 2024.
14 A.  Failure of the owner of a nonessential transmission line to submit the 
15 documentation, analysis or other information that demonstrates to the department's 
16 satisfaction that the transmission line and the electricity it transports contributes to the 
17 reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions constitutes a violation of the permit 
18 issued under this article and the department shall take appropriate action in accordance 
19 with section 347-A, which may include, but is not limited to, entry of an administrative 
20 consent agreement requiring the owner to pay to the department penalties calculated in 
21 proportion to the amount of electricity transported using the transmission line that, in 
22 the department's determination, does not contribute to the reduction of global 
23 greenhouse gas emissions.
24 B.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if pursuant to a violation 
25 under paragraph A, the department requires the owner of a nonessential transmission 
26 line to pay penalties in accordance with section 347-A or 349, the department shall 
27 transfer those penalty amounts to the Efficiency Maine Trust established in Title 35-A, 
28 section 10103 for deposit in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund 
29 established in Title 35-A, section 10109 or another fund as determined by the 
30 department.
31 C.  The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.  Rules adopted 
32 pursuant to this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
33 subchapter 2-A.
34SUMMARY
35 This bill amends the site location of development laws to provide additional 
36 requirements applicable to permanently installed transmission lines carrying 100 kilovolts 
37 or more of electricity that are constructed primarily to transport electricity generated 
38 outside of the State and that achieve commercial operation after January 1, 2024.  Those 
39 lines are defined in the bill as "nonessential transmission lines."  The bill provides that a 
40 permit issued under the site location of development laws for a nonessential transmission 
41 line is conditioned on the owner of the nonessential transmission line, no later than one 
42 year after the transmission line achieves commercial operation, submitting to the 
43 Department of Environmental Protection documentation, analysis or other information, 
44 prepared by an independent 3rd party, that demonstrates to the department's satisfaction 35

46 global greenhouse gas emissions.  Failure to demonstrate that the transmission line and the 
47 electricity it transports contributes to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions 
48 constitutes a violation of the permit for which the department shall take appropriate action, 
49 which may include entry of an administrative consent agreement requiring the owner to 
50 pay penalty amounts calculated in proportion to the amount of electricity transported using 
51 the transmission line that does not contribute to the reduction of global greenhouse gas 
52 emissions.1
