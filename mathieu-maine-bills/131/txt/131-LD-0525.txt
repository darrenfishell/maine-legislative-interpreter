13§3905.  Obligation to bargain
141.  Negotiations.  It is the obligation of the agricultural employer and the bargaining 
15 agent to bargain collectively.  "Collective bargaining" means, for the purposes of this 
16 chapter, the mutual obligation of the agricultural employer and the bargaining agent:
17 A.  To meet at reasonable times;
18 B.  To meet within 10 days after receipt of written notice from the other party 
19 requesting a meeting for collective bargaining purposes, as long as the parties have not 
20 otherwise agreed in a prior written contract;
21 C.  To confer and negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms 
22 and conditions of employment, except that, by the mutual obligation, neither party may

24 D.  To execute in writing any agreements arrived at, the terms of which are subject to 
25 negotiation; and
26 E.  To participate in good faith in the mediation and arbitration procedures required by 
27 this section.
28 Upon the filing by any person of a petition not earlier than the 90th day nor later than the 
29 60th day preceding the expiration of the 12-month period following initial certification 
30 under section 3907, subsection 4, the board shall determine whether an employer has 
31 bargained in good faith with the currently certified labor organization. If the board finds 
32 that the employer has not bargained in good faith, it may extend the certification for up to 
33 one additional year, effective immediately upon the expiration of the previous 12-month 
34 period following initial certification.
352.  Mediation.  This subsection governs the mediation of disputes between agricultural 
36 employers and agricultural employees.
37 A.  It is the declared policy of the State to provide full and adequate facilities for the 
38 settlement of disputes between employers and employees or their representatives and 
39 other disputes subject to settlement through mediation.
40 B.  Mediation procedures, as provided by section 965, subsection 2, must be followed 
41 when either party to a controversy requests mediation services prior to arbitration or 
42 upon motion of the board or the executive director.
Page 4 - 131LR0168(01)1 C.  The employer, labor organization or employees involved in collective bargaining 
2 shall notify the executive director, in writing, at least 30 days prior to the expiration of 
3 a contract, or at least 30 days prior to entering into negotiations for a first contract 
4 between the employer and the employees, or when a dispute arises between the parties 
5 threatening interruption of work.
6 D.  Any information disclosed by either party to a dispute to the Panel of Mediators, 
7 established pursuant to section 965, subsection 2, paragraph C, or any of its members 
8 in the performance of this subsection is privileged.
93.  Arbitration.  When the parties are unable to reach an agreement on a contract, 
10 within 90 days from and including the date of their first meeting, either party may petition 
11 the board to initiate final and binding arbitration regarding all unresolved issues.
12 A.  Upon receipt of the petition, the executive director shall issue an order requiring 
13 arbitration and requesting the parties to select one or more arbitrators.  If the parties 
14 have not selected an arbitrator or an arbitration panel within 5 days after the issuance 
15 of the order, the board shall order each party to select one arbitrator within 5 days and, 
16 if the 2 arbitrators cannot select a 3rd neutral arbitrator within 5 days, the board shall 
17 submit a list within 5 days from which the parties may alternately strike names until a 
18 single name is left, who the board shall appoint as arbitrator.  The arbitration panel 
19 shall call a hearing to be held within 10 days after the date of appointment.  In reaching 
20 a decision under this paragraph, the arbitration panel shall consider the following 
21 factors:
22 (1)  A comparison between the wages, hours and working conditions of the 
23 employees involved in the arbitration proceeding with those of other employees 
24 who perform similar services in private employment in other jurisdictions 
25 competing in the same labor market and who are covered by a collective bargaining 
26 agreement with their employer;
27 (2)  The overall compensation presently received by the employees, including 
28 direct wage compensation, vacation, holidays and excused time, insurance and 
29 pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and stability of 
30 employment and any other benefits received;
31 (3)  The overall compensation presently received by the nonbargaining unit 
32 employees of the employer and the employer's overall financial condition, 
33 including but not limited to sales, income and assets;
34 (4)  Any other factors not included in subparagraphs (1) to (3) that are normally 
35 and traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours and 
36 working conditions through voluntary collective bargaining, mediation-arbitration 
37 or otherwise between the parties, or in private employment, including the average 
38 Consumer Price Index; and
39 (5)  The need to establish fair and reasonable conditions in relation to job 
40 qualifications and responsibilities and the goal of promoting stability in the labor 
41 force and farm labor relations.
42 B.  The determination by the arbitration panel on all issues is final and binding on the 
43 parties.
Page 5 - 131LR0168(01)1 C.  A hearing held pursuant to this subsection must be informal and the rules of 
2 evidence for judicial proceedings are not binding.  Any documentary evidence and 
3 other information determined to be relevant by the arbitration panel may be received 
4 in evidence.  The arbitration panel may administer oaths and require by subpoena 
5 attendance and testimony of witnesses and production of books, records and other 
6 evidence relating to the issues presented.  The hearing must be concluded within 20 
7 days of the date of commencement.
8 D.  The arbitration panel shall submit the panel's report to the parties and the board 
9 within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, unless that time limitation is 
10 extended by the executive director.
114.  Costs.  The costs for the services of the mediator and of the neutral arbitrator 
12 including per diem expenses, actual and necessary travel and subsistence expenses and the 
13 costs of hiring the premises where any mediation or arbitration proceedings are conducted 
14 must be shared equally by the parties to the proceedings except that any party that 
15 intentionally and unreasonably prolongs the proceedings or causes excessive costs or 
16 expenses is responsible for the excessive costs or expenses. All other costs are assumed by 
17 the party incurring them.
185.  Arbitration administration.  The cost for services rendered and expenses incurred 
19 by the State Board of Arbitration and Conciliation, as described in section 931, and any 
20 state cost allocation program charges are shared equally by the parties to the proceedings 
21 and must be deposited into a nonlapsing special fund administered by the board.  
22 Authorization for services rendered and expenditures incurred by members of the State 
23 Board of Arbitration and Conciliation is the responsibility of the executive director.  All 
24 costs are paid from the special fund administered by the board.  The executive director may 
25 estimate costs upon receipt of a request for services and collect the estimated costs before 
26 providing the services.  The executive director shall bill or reimburse the parties for any 
27 difference between the estimated costs that were collected and the actual costs of providing 
28 the services.  When one party has paid its share of the estimated cost of providing the 
29 services, the matter is scheduled for hearing.  A party that has not paid the estimated or 
30 actual cost of providing services within 60 days of the date the invoice for those costs was 
31 issued is, in the absence of good cause shown, liable for the amount of the invoice and a 
32 penalty of 25% of the amount of the invoice.  Any penalty amount collected pursuant to 
33 this subsection remains in the special fund administered by the board.  The executive 
34 director is authorized to collect any sums due and payable pursuant to this subsection 
35 through civil action.  In such an action, the court shall allow litigation costs, including court 
36 costs and reasonable attorney's fees, to be deposited into the General Fund if the executive 
37 director is the prevailing party in the action.
386.  Termination and modification.  This subsection governs termination and 
39 modification of collective bargaining contracts between agricultural employers and 
40 agricultural employees.
41 A.  When a collective bargaining contract is in effect covering agricultural employees, 
42 a party to the contract may not terminate or modify the contract unless the party 
43 desiring termination or modification:
44 (1)  Serves written notice upon the other party to the contract of the proposed 
45 termination or modification not less than 60 days before the expiration date of the 
Page 6 - 131LR0168(01)46 contract or, if the contract contains no expiration date, 60 days before the proposed 
47 termination or modification time;
3 (2)  Offers to meet and confer with the other party for the purpose of negotiating a 
4 new contract or a contract containing the proposed modification;
5 (3)  Notifies the board within 30 days after the notice under subparagraph (1) is 
6 given, if no agreement has been reached by that time; and
7 (4)  Continues in effect, without resorting to strike or lockout, all the terms and 
8 conditions of the existing contract for a period of 60 days after the notice under 
9 subparagraph (1) is given or until the expiration of the contract, whichever occurs 
10 later.
11 B.  The duties imposed upon agricultural employers and labor organizations by 
12 paragraph A, subparagraphs (2) to (4) become inapplicable upon an intervening 
13 certification of the board that the labor organization or individual that is a party to the 
14 contract has been superseded as, or has ceased to be, the representative of the 
15 employees, subject to sections 3906 and 3907, and the duties so imposed may not be 
16 construed to require either party to discuss or agree to any modification of the terms 
17 and conditions contained in a contract for a fixed period if the modification is to 
18 become effective before the terms and conditions can be renegotiated under the 
19 provisions of the contract.  Any agricultural employee who engages in a strike within 
20 the 60-day period specified in this section is deemed to no longer meet the definition 
21 of an agricultural employee under section 3902, subsection 1 of the agricultural 
22 employer engaged in the particular labor dispute, for the purposes of sections 3904 and 
23 3906 to 3907, but the change in definition for that employee terminates if that employee 
24 is reemployed by the employer.
25§3906.  Bargaining unit; how determined
261.  Unit determination.  If there is a dispute between the agricultural employer and an 
27 employee or employees over the appropriateness of a bargaining unit for purposes of 
28 collective bargaining or between the agricultural employer and an employee or employees 
29 over whether a supervisory or other position is included in the bargaining unit, the 
30 executive director or the executive director's designee shall conduct a proceeding to make 
31 the determination, except that anyone excepted from the definition of "agricultural 
32 employee" under section 3902, subsection 1 may not be included in a bargaining unit.  The 
33 executive director or the executive director's designee conducting bargaining unit 
34 determination proceedings may administer oaths and require by subpoena the attendance 
35 and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records and other evidence relative 
36 or pertinent to the issues represented.
372.  Determination of exclusion of supervisory position; criteria.  In determining, 
38 pursuant to subsection 1, whether a supervisory position should be excluded from the 
39 proposed bargaining unit, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall 
40 consider, among other criteria, if the principal functions of the position are characterized 
41 by performing management control duties such as scheduling, assigning, overseeing and 
42 reviewing the work of subordinate employees; performing duties that are distinct and 
43 dissimilar from those performed by the employees supervised; exercising judgment in 
44 adjusting grievances, applying other established personnel policies and procedures and 
45 enforcing a collective bargaining agreement; or establishing or participating in the 1
2
Page 7 - 131LR0168(01)46 establishment of performance standards for employees and taking corrective measures to 
47 implement those standards.
33.  Determination of bargaining unit appropriateness.  In determining the 
4 bargaining unit that is appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining, the executive 
5 director or the executive director's designee shall ensure that employees have the fullest 
6 freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this chapter, ensure a clear and identifiable 
7 community of interest among employees and avoid excessive fragmentation among 
8 bargaining units.
94.  Bargaining unit clarification.  If there is a certified or currently recognized 
10 bargaining agent and the circumstances surrounding the formation of an existing bargaining 
11 unit are alleged to have changed sufficiently to warrant modification in the composition of 
12 that bargaining unit, the agricultural employer or any certified or recognized bargaining 
13 agent may file with the executive director a petition for a unit clarification when the parties 
14 are unable to agree on appropriate modifications and there is no question concerning 
15 representation.
16§3907.  Determination of bargaining agent
171.  Voluntary recognition.  An agricultural employee organization may file a request 
18 with an agricultural employer alleging that a majority of the agricultural employees in an 
19 appropriate bargaining unit wish to be represented for the purposes of collective bargaining 
20 between the agricultural employer and the employees' organization.  The request must 
21 describe the grouping of jobs or positions that constitute the unit considered appropriate 
22 and include a demonstration of majority support. The request for recognition must be 
23 granted by the agricultural employer.
242.  Majority sign-up.  If a request by an agricultural employee organization for 
25 recognition pursuant to subsection 1 is not granted by the agricultural employer, the 
26 executive director or the executive director's designee shall examine the demonstration of 
27 support. If the executive director or the executive director's designee finds that a majority 
28 of the employees in a unit appropriate for bargaining have signed valid authorizations 
29 designating the employees' organization specified in the petition as their bargaining 
30 representative and that no other individual or labor organization is currently certified or 
31 recognized as the exclusive representative of any of the employees in the unit, the board 
32 may not direct an election but shall certify the employees' organization as the 
33 representative. However, if the majority status of the employees in the appropriate unit is 
34 in question, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall call an election 
35 to determine whether the organization represents a majority of the members in the 
36 bargaining unit.
373.  Elections.  The executive director, or the executive director's designee, pursuant to 
38 subsection 2 or upon receiving a signed petition of at least 30% of a bargaining unit of 
39 agricultural employees stating that they desire to be represented by an agricultural 
40 employee organization, shall conduct a secret ballot election to determine whether the 
41 organization represents a majority of the members in the bargaining unit.
42 A.  The election may be conducted at suitable work locations or through the United 
43 States mail and the procedures adopted and employed must ensure that neither the 
44 employee organizations nor the management representatives involved in the election 
45 have access to information that identifies a voter.1
2
Page 8 - 131LR0168(01)1 B.  The ballot must contain the name of the employee organization and that of any 
2 other employee organization showing written proof of at least 10% representation of 
3 the agricultural employees within the unit, together with a choice for an agricultural 
4 employee to designate that the employee does not desire to be represented by a 
5 bargaining agent.
6 If more than one organization is on the ballot and none of the 3 or more choices receives 
7 a majority vote of the agricultural employees voting, a run-off election must be held.  
8 The run-off ballot must contain the 2 choices that received the largest and next largest 
9 number of votes.
104.  Bargaining agent certified.  When an organization receives the majority of votes 
11 of those voting, the executive director shall certify that organization as the bargaining 
12 agent.  The agricultural employer shall recognize the bargaining agent certified as 
13 representing a bargaining unit as the exclusive bargaining agent for all of the employees in 
14 the bargaining unit unless a decertification election by secret ballot is held and the 
15 bargaining agent is declared by the executive director as not representing a majority of the 
16 unit.
175.  Decertification.  When 30% of the employees in a certified bargaining unit petition 
18 for a bargaining agent to be decertified, the procedures for conducting an election on the 
19 question are the same as for representation as a bargaining agent set forth in this section.
206.  Questions concerning representation.  A question concerning representation may 
21 not be raised within one year of a certification or attempted certification.  When a valid 
22 collective bargaining agreement is in effect, a question concerning unit or representation 
23 may not be raised except during the period neither more than 90 days nor less than 60 days 
24 prior to either the expiration date of the agreement or its anniversary date if the agreement 
25 contains no expiration date.  Matters of unit clarification may be raised at any time.
267.  Representation of employees within unit regardless of membership.  The 
27 bargaining agent certified by the executive director as the exclusive bargaining agent is 
28 required to represent all the agricultural employees within the unit without regard to 
29 membership in the organization certified as bargaining agent. An agricultural employee at 
30 any time may present the employee's grievance to the agricultural employer and have the 
31 grievance adjusted without the intervention of the bargaining agent if the adjustment is not 
32 inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement then in effect and if the 
33 bargaining agent's representative has been given reasonable opportunity to be present at 
34 any meeting of the parties called for the resolution of the grievance.
35§3908.  Maine Labor Relations Board; procedure and review
361.  Proceedings subject to rules.  Proceedings conducted under this chapter are subject 
37 to the rules and procedures of the board adopted under section 968, subsection 3.
382.  Review of representation proceedings.  Any person aggrieved by any ruling or 
39 determination of the executive director under section 3906 or 3907 may appeal to the board 
40 within 15 days of the announcement of the ruling or determination, except that in the 
41 instance of objections to the conduct of an election or challenged ballots the time period is 
42 5 working days.  Upon receipt of an appeal, the board shall within a reasonable time give 
43 notice in writing 7 days in advance of the time and place of a hearing to the aggrieved party, 
44 the labor organizations or the bargaining agent and the agricultural employer and the board 
Page 9 - 131LR0168(01)45 shall hold the hearing.  The hearing must be in accordance with section 968. Decisions of 
46 the board made pursuant to this subsection are subject to review by the Superior Court 
47 under the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80C, in accordance with the standards 
48 specified in section 1292, if the complaint is filed within 15 days of the date of issuance of 
49 the decision.  The complaint must be served upon the board and all parties to the board 
50 proceedings by certified mail, return receipt requested.
7§3909.  Prevention of prohibited acts
81.  Prevention of prohibited acts; board powers.  The board may prevent a person, 
9 an agricultural employer, an agricultural employee, an agricultural employee organization 
10 or a bargaining agent from engaging in a prohibited act under section 3904.  This subsection 
11 is not affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be 
12 established by agreement, law or otherwise.
132.  Complaints.  An agricultural employer, an agricultural employee, an agricultural 
14 employee organization or a bargaining agent that believes that a person, an agricultural 
15 employer, an agricultural employee, an agricultural employee organization or a bargaining 
16 agent has engaged in or is engaging in a prohibited practice may file a complaint with the 
17 executive director stating the charges.  The complaint may not be filed with the executive 
18 director until the complaining party has served a copy of it upon the party named in the 
19 complaint.  Upon receipt of a complaint, the executive director or the executive director's 
20 designee shall review the charge to determine whether the facts as alleged constitute a 
21 prohibited act. If it is determined that the facts do not, as a matter of law, constitute a 
22 violation, the charge must be dismissed by the executive director, subject to review by the 
23 board.  If the executive director or the board determines that a formal hearing is necessary, 
24 the executive director must serve upon the parties to the complaint a notice of the 
25 prehearing conference and of the hearing before the board.  The notice must include the 
26 time and place of hearing for the prehearing conference or the hearing, as appropriate.  A 
27 hearing may not be held based upon an alleged prohibited practice occurring more than 6 
28 months before the filing of the complaint with the executive director.  The party named in 
29 the complaint has the right to file a written answer to the complaint and to appear in person 
30 or otherwise and give testimony at the place and time fixed for the hearing.  Through the 
31 discretion of the board, any other person or organization may be allowed to intervene in 
32 the proceeding and to present testimony.  This subsection does not restrict the right of the 
33 board to require the executive director or the executive director's designee to hold a 
34 prehearing conference on any prohibited practice complaint prior to the hearing before the 
35 board and to take an action, including dismissal, to attempt to resolve disagreements 
36 between the parties or to recommend an order to the board, when the executive director 
37 determines appropriate, subject to review by the board.
383.  Cease and desist order.  If after hearing and argument, upon a preponderance of 
39 the evidence received, the board is of the opinion that a party named in the complaint has 
40 engaged in or is engaging in a prohibited practice, the board shall state in writing its 
41 findings of fact and the reasons for its conclusions and issue and cause to be served upon 
42 that party an order requiring the party to cease and desist from the prohibited practice and 
43 to take affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay 
44 and making employees whole, when the board considers relief appropriate, for the loss of 
45 pay resulting from the employer's refusal to bargain, and to provide other relief, including 
46 payment of attorney's fees and costs.  An order of the board may not require the 1

6
Page 10 - 131LR0168(01)47 reinstatement of an individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged or 
48 the payment to the employee of any back pay if the individual was suspended or discharged 
49 for cause.
44.  Dismissal of complaint.  If after hearing and argument, upon a preponderance of 
5 the evidence received, the board is not of the opinion that the party named in the complaint 
6 has engaged in or is engaging in any prohibited practice, the board shall state in writing its 
7 findings of fact and the reasons for its conclusions and issue an order dismissing the 
8 complaint.
95.  Enforcement action; scope of review; consolidation of actions.  If after the 
10 issuance of an order by the board requiring a party to cease and desist or to take any other 
11 affirmative action the party fails to comply with the order of the board, the party in whose 
12 favor the order operates or the board may file a civil action in Superior Court to compel 
13 compliance with the order of the board.  Upon application of a party in interest or the board, 
14 the court may grant temporary relief or a restraining order and may impose terms and 
15 conditions as determined just and proper. The board's decision may not be stayed except 
16 when it is clearly shown to the satisfaction of the court that substantial and irreparable 
17 injury will be sustained or that there is a substantial risk of danger to the public health or 
18 safety.  In an action to compel compliance, the Superior Court may not review the action 
19 of the board other than to determine whether the board has acted in excess of its jurisdiction.  
20 If an action to review the decision of the board is pending at the time of the commencement 
21 of an action for enforcement pursuant to this subsection or is filed later, the 2 actions must 
22 be consolidated.
236.  Review.  Either party may seek a review by the Superior Court of a decision or 
24 order of the board by filing a complaint in accordance with the Maine Rules of Civil 
25 Procedure, Rule 80C, if the complaint is filed within 15 days of the date of issuance of the 
26 decision. The complaint must be served upon the board and all parties to the board 
27 proceeding by certified mail, return receipt requested.  Upon the filing of the complaint, 
28 the court shall schedule the hearing at the earliest possible time and notify all interested 
29 parties and the board. Pending review and upon application of an interested party, the court 
30 may grant temporary relief or a restraining order and impose terms and conditions that the 
31 court determines just and proper, except that the board's decision or order is not stayed 
32 unless it is clearly shown to the satisfaction of the court that substantial and irreparable 
33 injury will be sustained or that there is a substantial risk of danger to the public health or 
34 safety.  The executive director shall immediately file in the court the record in the 
35 proceeding certified by the executive director or a member of the board. The record must 
36 include all documents filed in the proceeding and the transcript, if any.  A hearing must be 
37 held not less than 7 days after notice, and after the hearing the court may enforce, modify, 
38 enforce as modified or set aside in whole or in part the decision or order of the board, except 
39 that the findings of the board on questions of fact are final unless shown to be clearly 
40 erroneous.  An appeal to the Law Court must be the same as an appeal from an interlocutory 
41 order under section 6.
427.  Privileges seeking injunctive relief.  In a judicial proceeding authorized by this 
43 section in which injunctive relief is sought, sections 5 and 6 apply, except that neither an 
44 allegation nor proof of unavoidable substantial and irreparable injury to the complainant's 
45 property is required to obtain a temporary restraining order or injunction.

6 and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the presentation of 
7 books, records and other evidence relative or pertinent to the issues presented to the board 
8 for determination.  Witnesses subpoenaed by the board are allowed the same fees paid to 
9 witnesses in the Superior Court.  These fees, together with all necessary expenses of the 
10 board, must be paid by the Treasurer of State on warrants drawn by the State Controller.
11§3911.  Binding contract arbitration
12 A collective bargaining agreement between an agricultural employer and a bargaining 
13 agent may provide for binding arbitration as the final step of a grievance procedure.  An 
14 arbitrator with the power to make binding decisions pursuant to any such provision has no 
15 authority to add to, subtract from or modify the collective bargaining agreement.
16§3912.  Suits by and against unincorporated employee organizations
17 In any judicial proceeding brought under this chapter or to enforce the rights guaranteed 
18 by this chapter, an unincorporated employee organization may sue or be sued in the name 
19 by which it is known.
20§3913.  Review
21 Either party may seek a review of a binding determination by an arbitration panel or 
22 arbitrator pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act.
