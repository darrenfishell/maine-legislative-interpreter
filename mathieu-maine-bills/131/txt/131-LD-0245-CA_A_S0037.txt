FIRST SPECIAL SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "ft " to S.P. 111, L.D. 245, "An Act to Require a 
Person Receiving Unemployment Benefits to Attend Scheduled Interviews to Fulfill the 
Work Search Requirement" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 26 MRSA ยง1192, sub-ยง2, as amended by PL 2021, c. 456, ยง 18, is further 
amended to read: 
2. Has registered for work; appears for scheduled interview. The individual has 
registered for work at, and continued to report at, an employment office in accordance with 
rules the commissioner adopts, except that the commissioner may, by rule, waive or alter 
either or both of the requirements of this subsection as to individuals attached to regular 
jobs and as to such other types of cases or situations with respect to which the commissioner 
finds that compliance with the requirements would be oppressive, or would be inconsistent 
with the purposes of this chapter. A rule under this subsection may not conflict with section 
1191, subsection 1. 
The individual must actively seek work each week in which a claim for benefits is filed 
unless the individual is participating in approved training under subsection 6 or work search 
has been waived in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner and provide 
evidence of work search efforts in a manner and form as prescribed by the Department of 
Labor. The individual must appear at an interview scheduled with reasonable notice in 
writing by mail or electronically by a prospective employer. Failure to provide required 
work search documentation or to appear at an interview scheduled with reasonable notice 
in writing by mail or electronically by a prospective employer results in a denial of benefits 
in accordance with section 1194, subsection 2 for the week or weeks for which no 
documentation was provided or for which the individual failed to appear at a scheduled 
interview unless the department detem1ines there is good cause for the individual's failure 
to comply with this requirement or the totality of the work search activities performed 
otherwise satisfies the work search requirement;'
