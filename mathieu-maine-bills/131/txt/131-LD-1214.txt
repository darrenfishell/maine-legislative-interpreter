14SUMMARY
15 This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing products containing 
16 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
17 1.  It changes the definitions of "intentionally added PFAS" and "perfluoroalkyl and 
18 polyfluoroalkyl substances."
19 2.  It changes the date for the requirement that a manufacturer of a product for sale in 
20 the State that contains intentionally added PFAS submit a written notification to the 
21 Department of Environmental Protection from January 1, 2023 to January 1, 2024.  With 
22 respect to this notification, it requires a manufacturer to designate confidential business 
23 information claims in accordance with the laws of the State and the Uniform Trade Secrets 
24 Act.
25 3.  It removes the provision of law that provides that, effective January 1, 2030, a 
26 person may not sell, offer for sale or distribute for sale in this State any product that contains 
27 intentionally added PFAS, unless the department has determined by rule that the use of 
28 PFAS in the product is a currently unavoidable use.  Current law provides that the 
29 department may by rule identify products by category or use that may not be sold, offered 
30 for sale or distributed for sale in this State if they contain intentionally added PFAS and 
31 that products in which the use of PFAS is a currently unavoidable use as determined by the 
32 department may be exempted by the department by rule.15
