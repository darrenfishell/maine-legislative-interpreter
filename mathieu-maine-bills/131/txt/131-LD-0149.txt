2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง681, sub-ยง2, as amended by PL 2005, c. 647, ยง2 and affected 
3 by ยง5, is further amended to read:
42.  Homestead.  "Homestead" means any residential property, including cooperative 
5 property, in this State assessed as real property owned by an applicant or held in a revocable 
6 living trust for the benefit of the applicant and occupied by the applicant as the applicant's 
7 permanent residence or owned by a cooperative housing corporation and occupied as a 
8 permanent residence by a resident who is a qualifying shareholder.  A "homestead" does 
9 not include any real property used solely for commercial purposes.
10SUMMARY
11 Current law provides that one of the qualifications of a homestead for the homestead 
12 property tax exemption is that real property held in trust must be in a revocable living trust.  
13 This bill removes the requirement that the living trust be revocable.11
