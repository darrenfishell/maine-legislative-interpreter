Page 1 - 131LR0480(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, Public Law 2021, chapter 641 authorized the Department of Environmental 
4 Protection to require a person licensed to discharge wastewater to sample effluent 
5 discharged for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS; and
6Whereas, pursuant to that law, the department may require that the costs of such 
7 sampling and testing, which can be substantial, are to be paid by the person licensed to 
8 discharge wastewater; and
9Whereas, to reduce the economic burden on these licensees while continuing to 
10 prevent further contamination of the soils and waters of the State from PFAS, it is necessary 
11 for the State to pay for the cost of such testing when the department requires it; and
12Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period 
13 to immediately protect these licensees from that economic burden; and
14Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
15 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
17 therefore,
18Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
19Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §413, sub-§12, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 641, §1, is amended to 
20 read:
2112.  Sampling for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.  Notwithstanding 
22 section 414‑A or any other provision of law to the contrary, the department by written 
23 notification may require a person licensed by the department to discharge wastewater to 
24 groundwater or any waters of the State to sample the effluent discharged for perfluoroalkyl 
25 and polyfluoroalkyl substances and to report the sample data to the department.  Upon 
26 receipt of the written notification and as directed by the department, the person shall 
27 conduct the required sampling of the effluent for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
28 substances and report the sample data to the department.  If the department requires a 
29 person to conduct effluent sampling in accordance with this subsection, all costs associated 
30 with the sampling and testing of samples must be paid by the department.
31 As used in this subsection, "perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances" has the same 
32 meaning as in Title 32, section 1732, subsection 5‑A.
33Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
34 takes effect when approved.
35SUMMARY
