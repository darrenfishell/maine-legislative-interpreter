28Sec. 4.  36 MRSA §684, as amended by PL 2009, c. 418, §2 and affected by §3, is

30§684.  Forms; application
311.  Generally.  The bureau shall furnish to the assessor of each municipality a sufficient 
32 number of printed forms to be filed by applicants for an exemption under this subchapter 
33 and shall determine the content of the forms.  A municipality shall provide to its inhabitants 
34 reasonable notice of the availability of application forms.  An individual claiming an

37 1st of the year on which the taxes are based.

10 to be a permanent resident of another state for the tax year for which an application for a 
11 homestead exemption is made commits a Class E crime.
123.  Continuation of eligibility.  The assessor shall evaluate annually the ongoing 
13 eligibility of property for which a homestead exemption has been approved under this 
14 subchapter.  The evaluation must be based on the status of the property on April 1st of the 
15 year on which the homestead exemption is based and the status as a permanent senior 
16 resident in the notice provided to the municipality as required in section 682-A.  The 
17 evaluation must include, but is not limited to, a review of whether the ownership of the 
18 property has changed in any manner that would disqualify the property for an exemption 
19 under this subchapter or whether the owner has ceased to use the property as a homestead.  
20 Unless the assessor determines that the property is no longer entitled to an exemption under 
21 this subchapter, the owner is entitled to receive the exemption without having to reapply.  
22 If the assessor determines that the property is no longer entitled to an exemption under this 
23 subchapter, the assessor shall notify the owner as provided in section 686 that the property 
24 is no longer entitled to an exemption under this subchapter.
254.  Owner notification.  An owner of property receiving an exemption under this 
26 subchapter shall notify the assessor promptly when the ownership or use of the property

28 qualification of the property for an exemption under this subchapter.
