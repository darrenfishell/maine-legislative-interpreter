Page 1 - 131LR0813(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3173-H, sub-§5, ¶B, as amended by PL 2019, c. 649, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 B.  Except as provided in paragraph E, must include qualifying criteria for a patient's 
5 eligibility for telemonitoring services that include documentation in a patient's medical 
6 record that the patient is at risk of hospitalization or admission to an emergency room 
7 or that the patient may be hospitalized or admitted or readmitted to an emergency room 
8 at the discretion of a provider. These rules must allow a provider to offer telemonitoring 
9 services if medically necessary given the patient's health status. These rules must allow 
10 any provider to determine the frequency of telemonitoring services to achieve care plan 
11 goals for the patient;
12Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §3173-H, sub-§7 is enacted to read:
137.  Telemonitoring requirements.  A patient must receive MaineCare coverage for 
14 telemonitoring services if:
15 A.  The telemonitoring services are intended to collect the patient's health-related data, 
16 including, but not limited to, pulse and blood pressure readings, that assist a provider 
17 in monitoring and assessing the patient's health status;
18 B.  The telemonitoring is medically necessary for the patient;
19 C.  The patient is cognitively and physically capable of operating the telemonitoring 
20 device or the patient has a caregiver willing and able to assist with the telemonitoring 
21 device; and
22 D.  The patient's residence is suitable for telemonitoring.  If the residence appears 
23 unable to support telemonitoring, telemonitoring may not be provided unless necessary 
24 adaptations are made.
25SUMMARY
26 This bill amends the law governing MaineCare services delivered through telehealth to 
27 change the rule-making authority of the Department of Health and Human Services, 
28 providing that qualifying criteria for telemonitoring services include documentation in a 
29 patient's medical record that the patient may be hospitalized or admitted or readmitted to 
30 an emergency room at the discretion of the patient's health care provider.  It also conditions 
31 MaineCare coverage for telemonitoring services on the intention to collect a patient's 
32 health-related data to assist in monitoring and assessing the patient's health status, 
33 telemonitoring's being medically necessary, the patient's capacity to participate in 
34 telemonitoring and the patient's having a suitable residence for telemonitoring.26
