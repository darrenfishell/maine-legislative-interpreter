12ยง9603.  Consumer rights
131.  Consumer rights.  A consumer is entitled to:
14 A.  Confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and 
15 to access that personal data, unless confirmation or access would require the controller 
16 to reveal a trade secret;
17 B.  Correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature 
18 of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data;
19 C.  Delete personal data provided by, or obtained about, the consumer; and
20 D.  Obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data processed by the controller, in a 
21 portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the 
22 consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, when the 
23 processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the controller is not required 
24 to reveal a trade secret.
252.  Opt-in. A controller may not process the personal data of a consumer for the 
26 purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data or profiling in furtherance of 
27 solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning 
28 the consumer unless the consumer opts in to the processing.
293.  Exercise of consumer rights.  A consumer may communicate and access the 
30 information necessary to exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable means 
31 established by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller's privacy 
32 notice. A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with section 9604 to 
33 exercise the rights of the consumer to opt in to the processing of the consumer's personal 
34 data for purposes of subsection 2 on behalf of the consumer. In the case of processing 
35 personal data of a child, the parent or legal guardian may exercise consumer rights on the 
36 child's behalf. In the case of processing personal data concerning a consumer subject to a 
37 guardianship, conservatorship or other protective arrangement, the guardian or the 
38 conservator of the consumer may exercise rights on the consumer's behalf.
394.  Responding to exercise of consumer rights.  Except as otherwise provided in this 
40 chapter, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer's 
41 rights authorized pursuant to this chapter as follows.
42 A.  A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 
43 the 45th day after receipt of the request. 
Page 7 - 131LR0947(01)1 B.  If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the 
2 controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but not later than the 45th 
3 day after receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and 
4 instructions for how to appeal the decision. 
5 C.  The controller shall provide information in response to a consumer's request, free 
6 of charge, one per consumer during a 12-month period. If requests from a consumer 
7 are manifestly unfounded, technically infeasible, excessive or repetitive, the controller 
8 may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of 
9 complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the 
10 burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, technically infeasible, excessive or 
11 repetitive nature of the request. 
12 D.  If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise a right afforded under 
13 subsection 1, using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller is not required to 
14 comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide 
15 notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to 
16 exercise the right until the consumer provides additional information reasonably 
17 necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request to exercise the right. 
18 E.  A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other 
19 than the consumer is in compliance with a consumer's request to delete that data 
20 pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph C by retaining a record of the deletion request and 
21 the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the consumer's personal 
22 data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using the retained data for 
23 any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
245.  Appeals.  A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the 
25 controller's inaction on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's 
26 receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be conspicuously available and similar to 
27 the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later than 
28 the 60th day after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of 
29 action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the 
30 reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the 
31 consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the 
32 consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.
33ยง9604.  Authorized agent
34 A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent, 
35 and act on the consumer's behalf, to opt in to the processing of the consumer's personal data 
36 for the purposes specified in section 9603, subsection 2. A controller shall comply with an 
37 opt-in request received from an authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, using 
38 commercially reasonable efforts, the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent's 
39 authority to act on the consumer's behalf.
40ยง9605.  Actions of controllers
411.  Duties.  A controller shall:
42 A.  Limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably 
43 necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data is processed, as disclosed to the 
44 consumer;
Page 8 - 131LR0947(01)1 B.  Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and 
2 physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility 
3 of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data;
4 C.  In the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a child, process the data 
5 in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 
6 United States Code, Section 6501 et seq., and the regulations, rules, guidance and 
7 exemptions adopted pursuant to that Act; and
8 D.  Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent 
9 under this section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer 
10 provided the consumer's consent and, upon revocation of the consent, cease to process 
11 the data as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the receipt of the request.
122.  Prohibitions.  A controller may not: 
13 A.  Process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's 
14 consent; 
15 B.  Process personal data in violation of the laws of this State and federal laws that 
16 prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers; 
17 C.  Process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of targeted advertising or sell 
18 the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent under circumstances 
19 when a controller has actual knowledge and willfully disregards that the consumer is 
20 at least 13 years of age but has not attained 16 years of age;
21 D.  Discriminate against a consumer for exercising a consumer right in this chapter, 
22 including by denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or 
23 services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer; 
24 or
25 E.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, process personal data for purposes 
26 that are neither reasonably necessary to, nor compatible with, the disclosed purposes 
27 for which the personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the 
28 controller obtains the consumer's consent.
29 A controller is not required to provide a product or service that requires the personal data 
30 of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain.
313.  Loyalty and rewards programs.  A controller may offer a different price, rate, 
32 level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or 
33 services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation 
34 in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program. 
354.  Transparency.   A controller shall provide consumers with an accessible, clear and 
36 meaningful privacy notice that includes:
37 A.  The categories of personal data processed by the controller;
38 B.  The purpose for processing personal data;
39 C.  How consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer 
40 may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;
41 D.  The categories of personal data that the controller shares with 3rd parties, if any;
Page 9 - 131LR0947(01)1 E.  The categories of 3rd parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data; 
2 and
3 F.  An active e-mail address or other mechanism that the consumer may use to contact 
4 the controller. 
55.  Sale and targeted advertising transparency.   A controller may not sell personal 
6 data to 3rd parties or process personal data for targeted advertising unless the individual to 
7 whom the personal data pertains opts in to the sale. 
86.  Consumer rights request mechanism. A controller shall establish, and shall 
9 describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit 
10 a request to exercise a consumer right pursuant to this chapter. The design of the secure 
11 and reliable means must take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact 
12 with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of requests and the 
13 ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A 
14 controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise a 
15 consumer right, but may require a consumer to use an existing account. 
167.  Deletion.  No later than July 1, 2025, a controller shall delete a consumer's personal 
17 data for the purposes of targeted advertising or sale of the personal data if the consumer 
18 has not opted in to the targeted advertising or sale. The platform, technology or mechanism 
19 for opting in may not unfairly disadvantage another controller or make use of a default 
20 setting but rather require the consumer to make an affirmative, freely given and 
21 unambiguous choice to opt in to processing of the consumer's personal data pursuant to this 
22 chapter.  The platform, technology or mechanism must:
23 A.  Be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
24 B.  Be as consistent as possible with another similar platform, technology or 
25 mechanism required by federal or state law; and
26 C.  Enable the controller to accurately determine whether the consumer is a resident of 
27 this State and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt in to the sale 
28 of the consumer's personal data or targeted advertising.  
298.  Opt-in preference signal.  A controller that recognizes an opt-in preference signal 
30 that has been approved by the laws of other states is in compliance with this subsection.
31ยง9606.  Responsibilities of processors and controllers
321.  Processor responsibilities.  A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a 
33 controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this 
34 chapter. Assistance provided under this section must include:
35 A.  Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the 
36 processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, so far as is reasonably 
37 practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to a consumer rights request;
38 B.  Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the 
39 processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation 
40 to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a 
41 breach of security, as defined in chapter 210-B, of the system of the processor, in order 
42 to meet the controller's obligations; and

2 data protection assessments.  
32.  Contractual requirements.  A contract between a controller and a processor must 
4 govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on 
5 behalf of the controller. The contract must clearly set forth instructions for processing data, 
6 the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of 
7 processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract must require that the 
8 processor:
9 A.  Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of 
10 confidentiality with respect to the data;
11 B.  At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as 
12 requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data 
13 is required by law;
14 C.  On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all 
15 information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's 
16 compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
17 D.  Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the 
18 controller's designated assessor. The processor may arrange for a qualified and 
19 independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical 
20 and organizational measures in support of the obligations in this chapter, using an 
21 appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for 
22 the assessment. The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller 
23 upon request; and
24 E.  Engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor 
25 to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.
263.  Processing relationship liability.  Nothing in this section may be construed to 
27 relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor 
28 by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship as described 
29 in this chapter. 
304.  Fact-based determination.   Determining whether a person is acting as a controller 
31 or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that 
32 depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not 
33 limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or 
34 who fails to adhere to the instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a 
35 specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's 
36 instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a 
37 processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the 
38 processing of personal data, the processor acts as a controller with respect to the processing 
39 and may be subject to an enforcement action under section 9610.
40ยง9607.  Data protection assessments
411.  Documentation.  A controller shall conduct and document a data protection 
42 assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that presents a heightened risk 
43 of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a 
44 heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes:
Page 11 - 131LR0947(01)1 A.  The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
2 B.  The sale of personal data;
3 C.  The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, when profiling 
4 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
5 (1)  Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;
6 (2)  Financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers;
7 (3)  A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private 
8 affairs or concerns, of consumers, when the intrusion would be offensive to a 
9 reasonable person; or 
10 (4)  Other substantial injury to consumers; and
11 D.  The processing of sensitive data. 
122.  Required elements.  Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection 
13 1 must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the 
14 processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the 
15 potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by 
16 safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks. The controller shall 
17 factor into the data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable 
18 expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship 
19 between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed. 
203.  Attorney General disclosure; exemption from public records.  The Attorney 
21 General may require that a controller disclose a data protection assessment that is relevant 
22 to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the 
23 data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may 
24 evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in 
25 this chapter. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from disclosure under 
26 Title 1, chapter 13. To the extent information contained in a data protection assessment 
27 disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client privilege 
28 or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of privilege or 
29 protection. 
304.  Processing activity.  A single data protection assessment may address a comparable 
31 set of processing operations that include similar activities. 
325.  Reciprocity.  If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose 
33 of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment 
34 satisfies the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is 
35 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would 
36 otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section. 
37ยง9608.  De-identified and pseudonymous data
381.  De-identified data requirements.  A controller in possession of de-identified data 
39 shall:
40 A.  Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an 
41 individual;
Page 12 - 131LR0947(01)1 B.  Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to 
2 re-identify the data; and
3 C.  Contractually obligate recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all 
4 provisions of this chapter. 
52.  De-identified data and pseudonymous re-identification of data.    Nothing in this 
6 chapter may be construed to require a controller or processor to:
7 A.  Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or
8 B.  Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access data or 
9 technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request 
10 with personal data. 
113.  Consumer requests.  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a 
12 controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the 
13 controller:
14 A.  Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data, or it 
15 would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the 
16 personal data;
17 B.  Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the 
18 subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data 
19 about the same consumer; and
20 C.  Does not sell the personal data to a 3rd party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the 
21 personal data to a 3rd party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in 
22 this section. 
234.  Pseudonymous data requirements.  The rights afforded under section 9603, 
24 subsection 1 do not apply to pseudonymous data in cases when the controller is able to 
25 demonstrate that information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is 
26 subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from 
27 accessing the information. 
285.  Contractual oversight.  A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or 
29 de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with 
30 contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject 
31 and shall take appropriate steps to address breaches of those contractual commitments.
32ยง9609.  Limitations
331.  Limitations on use.  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to restrict a 
34 controller's or processor's ability to:
35 A.  Comply with federal, state or municipal ordinances;
36 B.  Comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or 
37 summons by federal, state, municipal or other governmental authorities;
38 C.  Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;
39 D.  Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;
40 E.  Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the 
41 terms of a written warranty;
Page 13 - 131LR0947(01)1 F.  Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;
2 G.  Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical 
3 safety of the consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be 
4 manifestly based on another legal basis;
5 H.  Prevent, detect, protect against or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, 
6 harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or illegal activity or preserve the integrity 
7 or security of systems or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for an action 
8 described in this paragraph;
9 I.  Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public 
10 interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, 
11 monitored and governed by an institutional review board that determines, or similar 
12 independent oversight entities that determine:
13 (1)  Whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits 
14 that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;
15 (2)  Whether the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and 
16 (3)  Whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate 
17 privacy risks associated with research, including risks associated with 
18 re-identification;
19 J.  Assist another controller, processor or 3rd party with obligations under this chapter; 
20 or
21 K.  Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, but 
22 solely to the extent that the processing is:
23 (1)  Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the 
24 consumer whose personal data is being processed; and
25 (2)  Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations 
26 under federal or state laws or local ordinances. 
272.  Internal use.  The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this 
28 chapter do not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use or retain data for 
29 internal use to:
30 A.  Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or 
31 technology;
32 B.  Effectuate a product recall;
33 C.  Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; 
34 or
35 D.  Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the 
36 consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with 
37 the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the 
38 provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the 
39 performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party. 
403.  Evidentiary privilege. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under 
41 this chapter do not apply when compliance by the controller or processor with this chapter 
Page 14 - 131LR0947(01)42 would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State. Nothing in this chapter 
43 may be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data 
44 concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of 
45 this State as part of a privileged communication. 
54.  Liability.  A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a 3rd-party 
6 processor or 3rd-party controller in accordance with this chapter has not violated this 
7 chapter if the 3rd-party processor or 3rd-party controller that receives and processes the 
8 personal data violates this chapter, as long as, at the time the disclosing controller or 
9 processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have 
10 actual knowledge that the receiving 3rd-party processor or 3rd-party controller would 
11 violate this chapter. A 3rd-party controller or 3rd-party processor receiving personal data 
12 from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise not in violation 
13 of this chapter for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which the 3rd-party 
14 controller or 3rd-party processor receives the personal data.  
155.  Exemptions.  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to:
16 A.  Impose an obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights 
17 or freedoms of a person, including, but not limited to, the rights of a person:
18 (1)  To freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the United States 
19 Constitution, Amendment I; or
20 (2)  Under Title 16, section 61; or
21 B.  Apply to a person's processing of personal data in the course of the person's purely 
22 personal or household activities.
236.  Limitations.  Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may 
24 be processed to the extent that the processing is:
25 A.  Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
26 B.  Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific 
27 purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or retained pursuant to 
28 subsection 2 must, when applicable, take into account the nature and purpose of the 
29 collection, use or retention. The data is subject to reasonable administrative, technical 
30 and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the 
31 personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating 
32 to the collection, use or retention of personal data. 
337.  Controller burden.  If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an 
34 exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the 
35 processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the limitations in subsection 6. 
368.  Clarification of roles.  Processing personal data for the purposes expressly 
37 identified in this section does not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect to the 
38 processing.
39ยง9610.  Enforcement
401.  Exclusive Attorney General enforcement.  The Attorney General has the 
41 exclusive authority to enforce violations of this chapter. The provisions of Title 5, section 
42 207, subsection 2 do not apply to this chapter. 1

Page 15 - 131LR0947(01)12.  Right to cure.  Before initiating an action for a violation of a provision of this 
2 chapter, the Attorney General shall issue a notice of violation to the controller identifying 
3 the specific provisions of this chapter the Attorney General alleges have been or are being 
4 violated. If the controller or processor cures the violation before the 30th day after the date 
5 of the notice and provides the Attorney General an express written statement that the 
6 alleged violations have been cured and that no further violations will occur, the Attorney 
7 General may not initiate an action against the controller or processor for the violation listed 
8 in the notice.
93.  Violation of statute. A violation of this chapter constitutes an unfair trade practice 
10 under Title 5, chapter 10 and may be enforced solely by the Attorney General. The 
11 provisions of Title 5, section 213 do not apply to a violation of this chapter.
12Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA ยง9301, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 216, ยง1 and affected by ยง2, 
13 is repealed.
