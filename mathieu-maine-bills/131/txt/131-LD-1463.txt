Page 1 - 131LR2239(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §101, sub-§23, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 683, Pt. A, §2 and 
3 affected by Pt. B, §5, is amended to read:
423.  Farming.  "Farming" means engaging in farming in all its branches and the 
5 cultivation and tillage of the soil as a livelihood and includes dairying; raising livestock, 
6 equines, freshwater fish, fur-bearing animals or poultry; producing, cultivating, growing 
7 and harvesting fruit, produce or floricultural or horticultural commodities; or any practices 
8 on a farm that are incident to or in conjunction with these farming operations.  For the 
9 purposes of this Title, "farming" does not include forestry,  or the growing of timber  or the 
10 operation of a farm for recreational activity.
11Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §2013, sub-§1, ¶A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 7, §1, is further 
12 amended to read:
13 A.  "Commercial agricultural production" means commercial production of crops, 
14 maple syrup, honey, plants, trees,  and compost and the raising and keeping of livestock , 
15 including equines.
16SUMMARY
17 This bill amends the definition of "farming" in the motor vehicle statutes to include 
18 raising equines and strikes the provision that specifies that farming does not include the 
19 operation of a farm for recreational activity.  By including equines in the definition of 
20 "farming," certain motor vehicle laws, including registration, licensing and overwidth 
21 vehicle requirements for tractors and trailers used in farming, will apply to tractors and 
22 trailers used in raising equines.
23 The bill also amends the definition of "commercial agricultural production" in the laws 
24 governing sales and use tax to include the raising and keeping of livestock, including 
25 equines.  By including the raising and keeping of livestock in the definition of commercial 
26 agricultural production, certain sales tax exemptions and refunds will apply to the raising 
27 and keeping of livestock.17
