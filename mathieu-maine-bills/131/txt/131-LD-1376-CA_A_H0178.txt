This leg1slat1on mcreases the mmtmum hourly wage from $13 80 per hour to $15 00 per hour effective January 1, 
2024 The prov1S1on m current law that requ1res the mm1mum wage to be increased annually by a cost-of-hving 
adJustinent remains in place Increasing the m1mmum wage to $15. 00 per hour 1s not expected to have a fiscal impact

$15 00 per hour 
The mcreased wages may mc1ease costs to mumc1palit1es dependmg on the existing iates of pay for the lowest paid 
employees in each mumcipahty at the tJ.me a higher wage would be imposed and cannot be detennmed at this time
