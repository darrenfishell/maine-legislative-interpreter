Page 1 - 131LR1068(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA §2002, sub-§3, ¶H-1 is enacted to read:
3 H-1.  "Shoplifting" means the intentional concealment of retail merchandise with the 
4 intent to deprive the retail store of the merchandise.  For purposes of this paragraph, 
5 "intent to deprive" has the same meaning as in section 352, subsection 3.
6Sec. 2.  17-A MRSA §2002, sub-§3, ¶I, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, 
7 is amended to read:
8 I.  "Work loss" means loss of income from work the injured person would have 
9 performed if the injured person had not been injured and expenses reasonably incurred 
10 by the injured person in obtaining services in lieu of those the injured person would 
11 have performed for income, reduced by any income for substitute work actually 
12 performed by the injured person or by income the injured person would have earned in 
13 available appropriate substitute work the injured person was capable of performing but 
14 unreasonably failed to undertake.  For a victim of a human trafficking offense as 
15 defined in Title 5, section 4701, subsection 1, paragraph C, "work loss" includes pay 
16 or benefits unfairly or illegally withheld from the victim by the offender or any unfair 
17 labor agreement under Title 26, section 629, as defined by rules adopted by the 
18 Department of Labor.  For a victim of shoplifting, "work loss" includes the time spent 
19 by the victim, an employee of the victim or an agent of the victim dealing with the 
20 offense, including time investigating the offense, pursuing the offender, engaging with 
21 law enforcement, engaging with attorneys and appearing in court.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill allows restitution to be paid to a victim of shoplifting for the time spent by the 
24 victim dealing with the offense.23
