2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง265 is enacted to read:
3ยง265.  Electronic health record; sexual orientation and gender identity data
4 A health care facility shall ensure that data related to sexual orientation and gender 
5 identity is collected from an individual as part of the health care information collected upon 
6 intake at a health care facility or during a visit to a health care facility.  This data is part of 
7 the individual's electronic health record.  For the purposes of this section, "health care 
8 facility" has the same meaning as in section 1711-C, subsection 1, paragraph D, "health 
9 care information" has the same meaning as in section 1711-C, subsection 1, paragraph E 
10 and "individual" has the same meaning as in section 1711-C, subsection 1, paragraph G.  
11 Data collected pursuant to this section is health care information that is subject to the 
12 confidentiality requirements of section 1711-C.  The sexual orientation and gender identity 
13 data required to be collected pursuant to this section is the same as the sexual and gender 
14 identity data elements added by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, 
15 Health Resources and Services Administration to the uniform data system administered by 
16 the Health Resources and Services Administration in 2016 or included in any subsequent 
17 standards.
18SUMMARY
