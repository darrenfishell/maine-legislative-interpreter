41.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A. "Deferred property taxes" means the amount of property taxes assessed on an 
7 eligible homestead, the collection of which is deferred by the municipality under a 
8 program.
9 B. "Eligible homestead" means a homestead owned and occupied by an eligible 
10 individual who is eligible for a homestead exemption under chapter 105, subchapter 
11 4-B for the property tax year during which an application for stabilization is made.
12 C. "Federal poverty level" means the nonfarm income official poverty line for a family 
13 of the size involved, as defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget and 
14 revised annually in accordance with the United States Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
15 Act of 1981.
16 D. "Homestead" has the same meaning as under section 681, subsection 2 and may 
17 include mobile homes if expressly included in a municipal ordinance adopted under 
18 this section.
19 E. "Household income" has the meaning set out in section 6201, subsection 7.
20 F. "Partial property tax deferral" means the deferral of the payment of property taxes 
21 assessed on an eligible homestead in excess of the stabilized taxes assessed on that 
22 eligible homestead.
23 G. "Program" means a stabilization and tax deferral program adopted by a municipality 
24 pursuant to subsection 2.
25 H. "Stabilize" means to set the amount of property tax required to be paid by a taxpayer 
26 on an eligible homestead in the property tax year during which the taxpayer first 
27 qualifies for the program and to maintain that amount each year thereafter.
28 I. "Stabilized taxes" means the amount of property tax to be billed to and due from the 
29 taxpayer on the taxpayer's eligible homestead in each year of the program.
30 J. "Tax-deferred property" means the property upon which taxes are partially deferred

33 entered on the assessment and tax roll.
34 L. "Taxpayer" means an individual who is responsible for payment of property taxes 
35 and has applied to participate or is currently participating in a program.
362.  Authority.  The legislative body of a municipality may by ordinance adopt a 
37 stabilization and partial property tax deferral program to provide benefits to seniors with 
38 homesteads in the municipality.  The ordinance must:
39 A. Require that the taxpayer be a permanent resident of the State as defined in section 
40 681, subsection 4;
Page 2 - 131LR0812(01)1 B. Require that the taxpayer have owned and occupied a homestead as a permanent 
2 residence in the municipality for a minimum number of years, either consecutive or 
3 cumulative, prior to application for the program;
4 C.  Specify the minimum age that qualifies a taxpayer as a senior as of April 1st 
5 preceding the date of the taxpayer's application for the program; and
6 D. Establish the minimum household income in relation to the federal poverty level for 
7 purposes of eligibility for the program.
8 A program may impose additional standards of eligibility and procedures, as long as those 
9 standards are established by the municipality by ordinance, except that a taxpayer who has 
10 been determined eligible to defer or is deferring property taxes under any other property 
11 tax deferral program administered by the State, including, but not limited to, the programs 
12 set forth in chapters 908 and 908-B, may not be eligible to participate in a program adopted 
13 by a municipality pursuant to this section.
143.  Application.  A municipality that adopts a program shall develop an application for 
15 the program and establish a due date for a taxpayer to submit an application.  A taxpayer 
16 may apply to the municipality in which the taxpayer's homestead is located requesting that 
17 the municipality stabilize the amount of property tax assessed on that individual's 
18 homestead and defer the payment and collection of property taxes on the homestead in 
19 excess of the stabilized taxes in the subsequent year.  A new application is required for 
20 each year for which stabilization is requested, subject to conditions set forth in the 
21 municipal ordinance that adopts the program, which may include a grace period for 
22 reapplication each year or automatic disqualification from the program for failure to file an 
23 application as required by ordinance.  The municipality shall determine by ordinance 
24 whether taxpayers may be eligible to participate in the program with a new application 
25 following disqualification.
26 An application, information submitted in support of an application and files and 
27 communications relating to an application for stabilization and partial deferral of property 
28 taxes under the program are confidential. Hearings and proceedings held by a municipality 
29 on an application must be held in executive session unless otherwise requested by the 
30 applicant.  Nothing in this paragraph applies to the recording of liens or lists under 
31 subsection 6 or any enforcement proceedings undertaken by the municipality pursuant to 
32 this section or other applicable law.
334. Stabilization and deferral.  If a taxpayer satisfies the eligibility criteria set forth in 
34 the municipal ordinance establishing the program and satisfies the municipal application 
35 criteria, the municipality shall stabilize the amount of property tax assessed on the 
36 taxpayer's homestead as of the most recent April 1st assessment prior to application for the 
37 program.  The municipality shall then defer the payment and collection of property tax 
38 assessed on the eligible homestead in excess of the stabilized taxes in subsequent years, as 
39 long as the taxpayer remains eligible for the program as set forth in this section and the 
40 municipal ordinance authorizing the program.
41 The taxpayer must remain responsible for the payment of stabilized taxes to remain eligible 
42 for the program.  Notwithstanding the partial deferral of the payment and collection of 
43 property tax in excess of the stabilized taxes under the program, the lien established on the 
44 eligible homestead under section 552 continues for the purpose of protecting the municipal 
45 interest in the eligible homestead. Interest on the amount of deferred property taxes accrues 
Page 3 - 131LR0812(01)46 at the rate of 0.5 percentage points above the otherwise applicable rate for delinquent taxes 
47 unless the municipality adopts a lower interest rate by ordinance. In order to preserve the 
48 right to enforce the lien, the municipality must record in the county registry of deeds a list 
49 of properties within the municipality that have become eligible for stabilization and partial 
50 property tax deferral. The list must contain a description of each property as listed in the 
51 municipal valuation together with the name of the taxpayer listed on the valuation. The list 
52 must be updated annually to reflect the addition or deletion of properties, the amount of 
53 deferred taxes accrued for each property and payments received.
9 The municipality shall make available upon request the most recent list of tax-deferred 
10 properties of that municipality required to be filed with the county registry of deeds under 
11 this subsection. The municipality may publish and release as public information statistical 
12 summaries concerning the program as long as the release of the information does not 
13 jeopardize the confidentiality of individually identifiable information.
14 The recording of the properties under this subsection is notice that the municipality claims 
15 a lien against those properties in the amount of the deferred taxes plus interest together with 
16 any fees paid to the county registry of deeds in connection with the recording. For a 
17 property deleted from the list, the recording serves as notice of release or satisfaction of the 
18 lien, even though the amount of taxes, interest or fees is not listed.
195.  Events requiring the payment of deferred tax and interest.  Subject to subsection 
20 7, all deferred property taxes and accrued interest must be paid pursuant to subsection 6 
21 when:
22 A. The taxpayer dies;
23 B. Some person other than the taxpayer becomes the owner of the property;
24 C. The tax-deferred property is no longer occupied by the taxpayer as a permanent 
25 residence, except that this paragraph does not apply if the taxpayer is required to be 
26 absent from the eligible homestead for health reasons;
27 D.  The tax-deferred property is a mobile home and is moved out of the State, if mobile 
28 homes are identified as eligible homesteads by municipal ordinance adopted under this 
29 section; or
30 E. The taxpayer fails to pay the stabilized taxes in any tax year.
316.  Lien.  When it is determined that one of the events set out in subsection 5 has 
32 occurred and that a property is no longer eligible for partial property tax deferral under this 
33 section, the municipality shall send notice by certified mail to the taxpayer, or the taxpayer's 
34 heirs or devisees, listing the total amount of deferred property taxes, including accrued 
35 interest and costs of all the years and establishing a due and payable date. For events listed 
36 in subsection 5, paragraphs A, B, C and E, payment is due within 45 days of the date of the 
37 notice. When the event listed in subsection 5, paragraph D occurs, the total amount of 
38 deferred property taxes is due and payable 5 days before the date of removal of the property 
39 from the State. The municipality shall include in the notice a statement that the lien 
40 enforcement procedures pursuant to chapter 105, subchapter 9 apply.  If the deferred 
41 property tax liability of a property has not been satisfied by the date established pursuant 
42 to this subsection, the municipality may enforce the lien according to procedures in chapter 
43 105, subchapter 9.1

Page 4 - 131LR0812(01)1 Partial payments accepted during the 18-month redemption period provided for in section 
2 943 may not interrupt or extend the redemption period or in any way affect foreclosure 
3 procedures.
47.  Transfer of eligibility.  If one of the events listed in subsection 5 occurs, and the 
5 ownership of the eligible homestead is transferred to another member of the same 
6 household, the transferee may apply to the municipality for continuation of the stabilization 
7 and partial property tax deferral if the transferee meets the conditions of this section and 
8 the municipal ordinance authorizing the program.
98.  Repeal of program.  A municipality that has adopted a program may discontinue 
10 it through the same procedure by which the program was adopted except that any property 
11 taxes deferred under the program continue to be deferred under the conditions of the 
12 program on the date it was ended.
13SUMMARY
14 This bill permits municipalities to establish a program by ordinance for seniors that 
15 provides for partial stabilization of property taxes accompanied by deferral of the amount 
16 of taxes due in excess of the stabilized amount.  Residents of a municipality that adopts 
17 such a program may not participate in the State's property tax deferral or stabilization 
18 programs.14
