2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง3110 is enacted to read:
3ยง3110.  Limitation on charges
4 A transmission and distribution utility may not charge a customer or demand, collect 
5 or receive from a customer for any transmission and distribution utility service performed 
6 by it within the State, or for any service in connection with that performance, a 
7 compensation that is not reviewed and approved by the commission.   The commission may 
8 not approve any charge or fee related to metering that is not uniform for all persons taking 
9 service in the same rate class.
10SUMMARY
11 This bill clarifies that all charges and fees collected by a transmission and distribution 
12 utility from its customers must be reviewed and approved by the Public Utilities 
13 Commission.   It also provides that the commission may not approve any charge related to 
14 metering that is not uniform for all persons taking service in the same rate class, thereby 
15 prohibiting customer-specific metering charges, such as a maintenance fee for a customer 
16 who has an older meter.11
