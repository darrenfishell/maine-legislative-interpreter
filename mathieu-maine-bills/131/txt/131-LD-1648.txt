29§1106-B.  Valuation of open space land
30 For purposes of this subchapter, open space land is valued according to and subject to 
31 the provisions of this section. 
321.  Open space valuation determined.  The State Tax Assessor shall determine the 
33 100% open space valuation for each county by adding the 100% valuation per acre for each 
34 forest type for each county obtained pursuant to section 576 and multiplying the sum by 
35 2/3.
362.  Additional reduction.  A landowner may apply for up to 2 of the following 
37 additional reductions in valuation specified in this subsection except that, notwithstanding 
38 any provision of law to the contrary, the value of forested open space land may not be 
39 reduced to less than the value it would have if enrolled in the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law 
40 and the open space valuation may not exceed just value as determined pursuant to section 
41 701-A.
Page 2 - 131LR1490(01)1 A.  Public access open space is eligible for a 25% reduction in the open space valuation 
2 if the landowner agrees to refrain from taking action to discourage or prohibit daytime, 
3 nonmotorized and nondestructive public use of that land. The landowner may permit, 
4 but is not obligated to permit as a condition of qualification under this paragraph, 
5 hunting, snowmobiling, overnight use or other more intensive outdoor recreational 
6 uses. The landowner, without disqualifying land under this paragraph, may impose 
7 temporary or localized public access restrictions to:
8 (1) Protect active habitat of endangered species listed under Title 12, chapter 925, 
9 subchapter 3;
10 (2) Prevent destruction or harm to fragile protected natural resources under Title 
11 38, chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 5‑A; or
12 (3) Protect a recreational user from any hazardous area.
13 B.  Permanently protected open space is eligible for a 25% reduction in the open space 
14 valuation.  For purposes of this paragraph, "permanently protected open space" is an 
15 area of open space land that is subject to restrictions prohibiting building development 
16 under a perpetual conservation easement pursuant to Title 33, chapter 7, subchapter 8-
17 A or as an open space preserve owned and operated by a state or federal natural 
18 resource agency or a nonprofit entity in accordance with section 1109, subsection 3, 
19 paragraph H.
20 C.  Open space that is the subject of a wildlife habitat management plan is eligible for 
21 a 25% reduction in the open space valuation as long as the requirements of subsection 
22 3 are met.
23 D.  Open space that is the subject of a carbon conservation management plan is eligible 
24 for a 25% reduction in the open space valuation as long as the requirements of 
25 subsection 3 are met.
263.  Management plans.  A landowner seeking an additional reduction in the open space 
27 valuation for a parcel pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph C or D shall comply with this 
28 subsection.
29 A. The landowner shall have prepared a carbon conservation management plan or a 
30 wildlife habitat management plan for the parcel for which the landowner is seeking an 
31 additional reduction pursuant to subsection 2 that complies with the following.
32 (1) For a carbon conservation management plan, the plan must describe strategies 
33 to be used on a parcel of land at least 10 acres in size to increase carbon storage or 
34 improve carbon conservation. The plan must be signed by a licensed forester or 
35 soil scientist and submitted to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
36 Forestry for approval.  A carbon conservation management plan may be revised or 
37 updated by mutual agreement between the landowner and the department.  A 
38 carbon conservation management plan must be renewed by the landowner at least 
39 once every 10 years.
40 (2) For a wildlife habitat management plan, the plan must describe strategies to 
41 ensure that the habitat benefits provided by the land are not lost.  The plan must be 
42 submitted to either the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry or 
43 the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife for approval.  Wildlife habitat 
44 management agreements may be revised or updated by mutual consent of both 
Page 3 - 131LR1490(01)45 parties at any time.  A wildlife habitat management agreement must be renewed at 
46 least once every 10 years.
3 B.  The landowner shall file a sworn statement with the municipal assessor for a parcel 
4 in a municipality or with the State Tax Assessor for a parcel in the unorganized territory 
5 that a carbon conservation management plan, if seeking an additional reduction under 
6 subsection 2, paragraph D, or a wildlife habitat management plan, if seeking an 
7 additional reduction under subsection 2, paragraph C, has been prepared for the parcel.
8 C.  The landowner shall comply with the relevant management plan prepared pursuant 
9 to paragraph A and shall submit every 10 years to the municipal assessor in a 
10 municipality or the State Tax Assessor for parcels in the unorganized territory a 
11 statement from the state agency with which the agreement was made that the landowner 
12 is managing the parcel according to schedules in the plan prepared pursuant to 
13 paragraph A.
14 D.  When a parcel of land taxed under this subchapter is transferred to a new owner, 
15 within one year of the date of transfer, the new landowner must file with the municipal 
16 assessor or the State Tax Assessor for land in the unorganized territory one of the 
17 following:
18 (1) A sworn statement indicating that a new management plan has been prepared 
19 and approved pursuant to paragraph A; or
20 (2) A sworn statement that the land is being managed in accordance with the 
21 management plan prepared for the previous landowner.
224.  Municipal reimbursement.  The State Tax Assessor shall distribute reimbursement 
23 under this subsection to each municipality in proportion to the product of the reduced open 
24 space valuation of the municipality multiplied by the property tax burden of the 
25 municipality. 
26 As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms have 
27 the following meanings.
28 A.  "Average value of undeveloped land" means the current regional per acre 
29 undeveloped land value as determined for state valuation purposes, or the current local 
30 per acre undeveloped land value as determined for state valuation purposes, whichever 
31 is less.
32 B.  "Property tax burden" means the total real and personal property taxes assessed in 
33 the most recently completed municipal fiscal year, except the taxes assessed on 
34 captured value within a tax increment financing district, divided by the latest state 
35 valuation certified to the Secretary of State.
36 C.  "Reduced open space valuation" means the difference between the average value 
37 of undeveloped land and the average value of classified open space land multiplied by 
38 the total number of acres of classified open space lands.
39 D.  "Undeveloped land" means rear acreage and unimproved nonwaterfront acreage 
40 that is not:

3 Pt. W, §5, is further amended to read:
43.  Open space land qualification.  The owner or owners of land who believe that land 
5 is open space land as defined in section 1102, subsection 6 shall submit a signed schedule 
6 on or before April 1st of the year in which that land first becomes subject to taxation under 
7 this subchapter to the assessor on a form prescribed by the State Tax Assessor that must 
8 contain a description of the land, a general description of the use to which the land is being 
9 put and other information required by the assessor to aid the assessor in determining 
10 whether the land qualifies for classification as open space land and for which of the 
11 valuation categories additional reductions set forth in section 1106‑A 1106-B the land is 
12 eligible.  The assessor shall determine whether the land is open space land as defined in 
13 section 1102, subsection 6 and, if so, that land must be classified as open space land and 
14 subject to taxation under this subchapter.  In determining whether the restriction of the use 
15 or preservation of the land provides a public benefit in one of the areas set forth in section 
16 1102, subsection 6, the assessor shall consider all facts and circumstances pertinent to the 
17 land and its vicinity.  A factor that is pertinent to one application may be irrelevant in 
18 determining the public benefit of another application. A single factor, whether listed below 
19 or not, may be determinative of public benefit.  Among the factors to be considered are:
20 A.  The importance of the land by virtue of its size or uniqueness in the vicinity or 
21 proximity to extensive development or comprising an entire landscape feature;
22 B.  The likelihood that development of the land would contribute to degradation of the 
23 scenic, natural, historic or archeological character of the area;
24 C.  The opportunity of the general public to appreciate significant scenic values of the 
25 land;
26 D.  The opportunity for regular and substantial use of the land by the general public for 
27 recreational or educational use;
28 E.  The importance of the land in preserving a local or regional landscape or resource 
29 that attracts tourism or commerce to the area;
30 F.  The likelihood that the preservation of the land as undeveloped open space will 
31 provide economic benefit to the town by limiting municipal expenditures required to 
32 service development;
33 G.  Whether the land is included in an area designated as open space land or resource 
34 protection land on a comprehensive plan or in a zoning ordinance or on a zoning map 
35 as finally adopted;
36 H.  The existence of a conservation easement, other legally enforceable restriction, or 
37 ownership by a nonprofit entity committed to conservation of the property that will 
38 permanently preserve the land in its natural, scenic or open character;
39 I.  The proximity of other private or public conservation lands protected by permanent 
40 easement or ownership by governmental or nonprofit entities committed to 
41 conservation of the property;
Page 5 - 131LR1490(01)1 J.  The likelihood that protection of the land will contribute to the ecological viability 
2 of a local, state or national park, nature preserve, wildlife refuge, wilderness area or 
3 similar protected area;
4 K.  The existence on the land of habitat for rare, endangered or threatened species of 
5 animals, fish or plants, or of a high quality example of a terrestrial or aquatic 
6 community;
7 L.  The consistency of the proposed open space use with public programs for scenic 
8 preservation, wildlife preservation, historic preservation, game management or 
9 recreation in the region;
10 M.  The identification of the land or of outstanding natural resources on the land by a 
11 legislatively mandated program, on the state, local or federal level, as particular areas, 
12 parcels, land types or natural resources for protection, including, but not limited to, the 
13 register of critical areas under Title 12, section 544‑B; the laws governing wildlife 
14 sanctuaries and management areas under Title 12, section 10109, subsection 1 and 
15 sections 12706 and 12708; the laws governing the State's rivers under Title 12, chapter 
16 200; the natural resource protection laws under Title 38, chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 
17 5‑A; and the Maine Coastal Barrier Resources Systems under Title 38, chapter 21;
18 N.  Whether the land contains historic or archeological resources listed in the National 
19 Register of Historic Places or is determined eligible for such a listing by the Maine 
20 Historic Preservation Commission, either in its own right or as contributing to the 
21 significance of an adjacent historic or archeological resource listed, or eligible to be 
22 listed, in the National Register of Historic Places; or
23 O.  Whether there is a written management agreement between the landowner and the 
24 Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or the Department of Agriculture, 
25 Conservation and Forestry as described in section 1102, subsection 10.  1106-B, 
26 subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (1) or (2); or
27 P.  Whether the land is currently enrolled in the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law.
28 If a parcel of land for which the owner or owners are seeking classification as open space 
29 contains any principal or accessory structures or any substantial improvements that are 
30 inconsistent with the preservation of the land as open space, the owner or owners in their 
31 schedule shall exclude from their application for classification as open space a parcel of 
32 land containing those buildings or improvements at least equivalent in size to the state 
33 minimum lot size as prescribed by Title 12, section 4807‑A or by the zoning ordinances or 
34 zoning map pertaining to the area in which the land is located, whichever is larger.  For the 
35 purposes of this section, if any of the buildings or improvements are located within 
36 shoreland areas as defined in Title 38, chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 2‑B, the excluded 
37 parcel must include the minimum shoreland frontage required by the applicable minimum 
38 lot standards under the minimum guidelines established pursuant to Title 38, chapter 3, 
39 subchapter 1, article 2‑B or by the zoning ordinance for the area in which the land is located, 
40 whichever is larger.  The shoreland frontage requirement is waived to the extent that the 
41 affected frontage is part of a contiguous shore path or a beach for which there is or will be, 
42 once classified, regular and substantial use by the public.  The shoreland frontage 
43 requirement may be waived at the discretion of the legislative body of the municipality if 
44 it determines that a public benefit will be served by preventing future development near the 
Page 6 - 131LR1490(01)45 shore or by securing access for the public on the particular shoreland area that would 
46 otherwise be excluded from classification.
3Sec. 6.  36 MRSA §1114, as enacted by PL 1975, c. 726, §2, is amended to read:
4§1114.  Application
5 No person can apply for classification for more than an aggregate total of 15,000 acres 
6 under this subchapter. The classification of farmland or open space land hereunder shall 
7 continue under this chapter continues until the municipal assessor, or State Tax Assessor 
8 in the unorganized territory, determine determines that the land no longer meets the 
9 requirements of such classification.
10Sec. 7.  36 MRSA §1118, as amended by PL 1993, c. 452, §14, is further amended 
11 to read:
12§1118.  Appeals and abatements
13 The denial of an application or an assessment made under this subchapter is subject to 
14 the abatement procedures provided by section 841.  Appeal from a decision rendered under 
15 section 841 or a recommended current use value valuation or additional reduction 
16 established under section 1106‑A 1106-B must be to the State Board of Property Tax 
17 Review.
18Sec. 8.  Application. This Act applies to property tax years beginning on or after 
19 April 1, 2024.
20SUMMARY
21 This bill establishes a new method for the valuation of land under the farm and open 
22 space tax law.  It extends eligibility for a reduced valuation to land managed under a carbon 
23 conservation management plan, which is a written agreement between the landowner and 
24 the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry that describes strategies to be 
25 used on a parcel of land at least 10 acres in size to increase carbon storage or improve 
26 carbon conservation.
27 It removes the requirement that wildlife habitat land meet specific criteria to be eligible 
28 for a reduced valuation, such as being designated by the Department of Inland Fisheries 
29 and Wildlife as supporting important wildlife habitat or identified by the Department of 
30 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry as supporting a natural vegetation community.  
31 Instead, such land is eligible for a reduced valuation if the landowner establishes and 
32 complies with a written management agreement between the landowner and either the 
33 Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or the Department of Agriculture, 
34 Conservation and Forestry to ensure that the habitat benefits provided by the land are not 
35 lost.
36 This bill establishes specific criteria for management plans, including requiring them 
37 to contain specific strategies for compliance, be sworn to and complied with by the 
38 landowner and renewed at least once every 10 years.
39 This bill requires the State Tax Assessor to reimburse municipalities for revenue lost 
40 as a result of being enrolled under the farm and open space tax law in a manner similar to 
41 the method of reimbursement under the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law.1
