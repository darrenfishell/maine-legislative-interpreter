This bill provides complimentary lifetime hunting and fishing licenses to a dependent of a veteran who is 100% 
pennanently and totally disabled. The Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife estimates that issuing these 
complimentary lifetime licenses will reduce Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the department by $863,085 
annually, starting in fiscal year 2023-24. The bill includes an accompanying deallocation of the same amount to reflect 
the revenue loss. This estimate incorporates certain assumptions about the number of veterans in the state, the number 
of veterans with 100% permanent and disabled status and the demographic composition of veterans in the state.
