Page 1 - 131LR0448(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  4 MRSA §307, first ¶, as corrected by RR 2021, c. 1, Pt. B, §11, is amended 
3 to read:
4 When a judge or register of probate is interested in that judge's or register of probate's 
5 own right, trust, or in any other manner, or is within the degree of kindred, by which in law 
6 that judge or register of probate may, by possibility, be heir to any part of the estate of the 
7 person deceased, or is named as executor, trustee or guardian of minor children in the will 
8 of any deceased resident of the county, such estate must be settled in the probate court of 
9 any adjoining county, which has as full jurisdiction thereof as if the deceased had died in 
10 that adjoining county. If the judge's or register of probate's interest arises after jurisdiction 
11 of such estate has been regularly assumed or existed at the time of the judge's or register of 
12 probate's appointment to office, and in all cases where an executor, administrator, guardian 
13 or trustee, whose trust is not fully executed, becomes judge or register of probate for the 
14 county in which that judge's or register of probate's letters were granted, further 
15 proceedings in that county must be transferred to the probate court in any adjoining county 
16 and there remain until completed, as if such court had had original jurisdiction thereof, 
17 unless said disability is removed before that time. Whenever in any case within under this 
18 section the disability of the judge or register is removed before the proceedings have been 
19 fully completed, the proceedings must then be transferred to the probate court in the county 
20 of original jurisdiction or to the probate court that otherwise would have had jurisdiction. 
21 In all such cases the register in such adjoining county shall transmit copies of all records 
22 relating to such estate to the probate office of the county where such estate belongs, to be 
23 there recorded. If there are fewer than 4 counties adjoining the county of a probate court 
24 that is required to transfer proceedings to an adjoining county under this section, the 
25 proceedings must be transferred to a probate court in one of the 4 counties nearest to the 
26 transferring probate court, as measured by the shortest distance along paved roads between 
27 the building in which the registry of probate is located in the transferring county and the 
28 building in which the registry of probate is located in the other county.
29Sec. 2.  18-C MRSA §1-504, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 and 
30 affected by PL 2019, c. 417, Pt. B, §14, is amended to read:
312.  Certification.  When required by subsection 1, the register shall certify to the 
32 register of deeds in the county where any affected real estate is situated a true copy of the 
33 portion of the will that devises the real estate, an abstract of the appointment of the personal 
34 representative or a true copy or an abstract of the petition for an elective share.  Each 
35 certification must also include:
36 A.  A description of the real estate derived from the probated will or the petition upon 
37 which the appointment of the personal representative was made;
38 B.  The name of the decedent;
39 C.  The name or names of the devisees or heirs; and
40 D.  In the case of a will, the date of allowance of the will and an indication whether the 
41 will was probated formally or informally.
42Sec. 3.  18-C MRSA §1-505, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 and affected 
43 by PL 2019, c. 417, Pt. B, §14, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:
Page 2 - 131LR0448(01)1§1-505.  Notices to devisees and heirs; furnishing of copies
21. Notice to devisees and heirs.  A register shall, within 30 days after the filing of an 
3 application for the appointment of a personal representative, notify by mail all of the 
4 decedent’s devisees and heirs of the right of a surviving spouse to demand an elective share 
5 and the time limit for making such an election and of the rights of a surviving spouse and 
6 children to the homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance.
72. Notice to devisees of probated will.  A register shall, within 30 days after a will is 
8 probated, notify by mail all devisees under the will that devises have been made to them, 
9 stating the name of the testator and the name of the personal representative, if a personal 
10 representative has been appointed at the time this notification is sent.
113. Furnishing of copies.  Devisees in a will may, upon application to the register, be 
12 furnished with a copy of the probated will upon payment of a fee of $1 per page.
13Sec. 4.  18-C MRSA §2-402, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 and affected 
14 by PL 2019, c. 417, Pt. B, §14, is amended to read:
15§2-402.  Homestead allowance

18 entitled to a homestead allowance amounting to $22,500 divided by the number of minor 
19 and dependent children of the decedent.  The homestead allowance is exempt from and has 
20 priority over all claims against the estate other than costs and expenses of administration 
21 and reasonable funeral expenses.  Homestead The homestead allowance is in addition to 
22 any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent child by intestate 
23 succession or by way of elective share and is in addition to any benefit or share passing to 
24 the surviving spouse or minor or dependent child by the decedent's will unless otherwise 
25 provided by intestate succession or by way of elective share  the decedent's will expressly 
26 provides that the benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent 
27 child is intended to be made in lieu of the homestead allowance.  The personal 
28 representative shall promptly satisfy the homestead allowance from available assets.
29Sec. 5.  18-C MRSA §2-403, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 and affected

31§2-403.  Exempt property
32 In addition to the homestead allowance, the decedent's surviving spouse is entitled from 
33 the estate to a value, not exceeding $15,000 in excess of any security interests in the estate 
34 of tangible personal property, including, but not limited to, in household furniture, 
35 automobiles, furnishings, appliances and personal effects.  If Except as otherwise provided 
36 in this section, if there is no surviving spouse, children of the decedent are entitled jointly 
37 to the same value; however, the decedent, by will, may exclude one or more adult children 
38 from the receipt of exempt property.  If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in 
39 excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than $15,000, or if 
40 there is not $15,000 worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or children are 
41 entitled to other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the $15,000 
42 value.  Rights The rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of 
43 exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate other than costs and 
44 expenses of administration and reasonable funeral expenses, except that the right to any 
Page 3 - 131LR0448(01)45 assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier 
46 payment of homestead allowance and family allowance.  These rights are The right to 
47 exempt property is in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or 
48 children by intestate succession or by way of elective share and is in addition to any benefit 
49 or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the decedent's will unless otherwise 
50 provided by intestate succession or by way of elective share  the decedent's will expressly 
51 provides that the benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children is intended to 
52 be made in lieu of the exempt property right and unless the decedent's will expressly 
53 excludes one or more adult children from the receipt of exempt property without providing 
54 a benefit or share in lieu thereof.  The personal representative shall promptly satisfy the 
55 exempt property from available assets.
12Sec. 6.  18-C MRSA §2-404, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 and affected 
13 by PL 2019, c. 417, Pt. B, §14, is amended to read:
14§2-404.  Family allowance
151.  Family allowance during administration.  In addition to the right to homestead 
16 allowance and exempt property, the decedent's surviving spouse and minor children whom 
17 the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by 
18 the decedent are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the estate for their 
19 maintenance during the period of administration, which allowance may not continue for 
20 longer than one year if the estate is inadequate to discharge allowed claims.  The allowance 
21 may be paid as a lump sum or in periodic installments.  It is payable to the surviving spouse, 
22 if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children; otherwise 
23 to the children, or persons having their care and custody.  If a minor child or dependent 
24 child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be made partially to the 
25 child or the child's guardian or other person having the child's care and custody, and 
26 partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear.  The family allowance is exempt from 
27 and has priority over all claims but not over except costs and expenses of administration, 
28 reasonable funeral expenses and the homestead allowance.  The personal representative 
29 shall promptly satisfy the family allowance from available assets.
302.  Not chargeable against Additional benefit or share; right terminates on death.  
31 The family allowance is not chargeable against in addition to any benefit or share passing 
32 to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent children by intestate succession or by way 
33 of elective share and is in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse 
34 or minor or dependent children by the decedent's will unless  otherwise provided by intestate 
35 succession or by way of elective share  the decedent's will expressly provides that the 
36 benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent children is intended 
37 to be made in lieu of the allowance.  The death of any person entitled to family allowance 
38 terminates that person's right to allowance not yet paid.

40 further amended to read:

42 Code, an informal testacy or appointment proceeding or a formal testacy or 
43 appointment proceeding may be commenced more than 3 years after the decedent's

37 Statutes, Title 18-C, section 5-308, subsection 4; section 5-409, subsection 4; and section 
38 5-511, subsection 4 apply retroactively to January 1, 2023.
Page 9 - 131LR0448(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill, which amends the Maine Uniform Probate Code and related provisions of 
3 law, is proposed by the Probate and Trust Law Advisory Commission pursuant to the Maine 
4 Revised Statutes, Title 18-C, section 1-803, subsection 2.
5 Under current law, if a judge of probate or register of probate has an interest in an 
6 estate, the estate must be transferred to and settled in the probate court in an adjoining 
7 county.  This bill provides that, if there are fewer than 4 counties adjoining the county of 
8 the probate court in which the conflict of interest arises, the estate must be transferred to 
9 any one of the 4 county probate courts that are nearest to the probate court of the 
10 transferring county. 
11 The bill provides that, when a petition for an elective share indicating that the decedent 
12 owned real estate has been filed, the register of probate must record in the registry of deeds 
13 an abstract of the petition for an elective share and not the entire petition.
14 The bill requires the register of probate to notify the decedent's devisees and heirs, 
15 within 30 days after the filing of an application for the appointment of a personal 
16 representative, of the right of a surviving spouse to demand an elective share and the time 
17 limit for making such an election and of the rights of a surviving spouse and children to the 
18 homestead allowance, to exempt property and to the family allowance.
19 The bill provides that the homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance 
20 have priority over all claims against an estate except for reasonable funeral expenses and 
21 administrative expenses; that a testator may expressly provide that the benefit or share 
22 passing to a surviving spouse or children through a will is intended to be made in lieu of 
23 the homestead allowance, exempt property or family allowance; and that the personal 
24 representative has the duty to promptly pay the homestead allowance, exempt property and 
25 family allowance from available assets, without requiring any demand by the surviving 
26 spouse or children.
27 The bill authorizes the filing of informal testacy proceedings more than 3 years after a 
28 decedent's death in the same circumstances in which formal testacy proceedings may be 
29 filed more than 3 years after the decedent's death under current law.
30 The bill further delays until January 1, 2025 the effective date of the statutes governing 
31 the confidentiality of proceedings for guardianships of adults, conservatorships and other 
32 protective arrangements.  These statutes currently have an effective date of January 1, 2023.  
33 The January 1, 2023 effective date was established by Public Law 2021, chapter 4 and was 
34 designed to give the Supreme Judicial Court time to address the confidentiality of all court 
35 records and then give the commission an opportunity to propose amendments to these 
36 statutes to ensure consistency with provisions adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court.   The 
37 Supreme Judicial Court adopted the Maine Rules of Electronic Court Systems with an 
38 effective date of August 21, 2020, and these rules contain extensive provisions governing 
39 the confidentiality of records filed with the Supreme Judicial Court, the Superior Court and 
40 the District Court. The Supreme Judicial Court has not yet had an opportunity to consider 
41 rules governing confidentiality of records filed with the probate courts. This bill further 
42 delays the effective date of these confidentiality statutes to January 1, 2025 to provide 
43 additional time for the Supreme Judicial Court, in conjunction with the commission and
