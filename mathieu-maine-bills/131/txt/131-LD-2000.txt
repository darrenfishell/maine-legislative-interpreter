6SUMMARY
7 In the current system of taxation for the rental or lease of tangible personal property, 
8 the rental or leasing company property is taxed at acquisition or when brought into Maine 
9 from out of state, but rental and lease receipts are exempt from sales and use tax.  This bill 
10 amends Maine sales and use tax law to make it more consistent with the predominant 
11 method of taxation in other states by allowing rental and leasing companies to purchase 
12 exempt from taxation all rental fleet and tangible personal property for resale and requiring 
13 the rental and leasing companies to collect sales tax from the customer. The bill includes a 
14 limited refund opportunity for use tax paid on the purchase of rental fleet and tangible 
15 personal property by rental and leasing companies prior to January 1, 2024.  The bill does 
16 not affect the lease or rental of trucks and truck tractors from a person primarily engaged 
17 in the business of leasing or renting trucks and truck tractors.7
