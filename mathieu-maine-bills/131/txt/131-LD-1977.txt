15 provides a detailed and accurate representation of the data collection, processing and 
16 transfer activities of the covered entity.  The policy must be provided in a manner that is 
17 reasonably accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.  The covered entity or 
18 service provider shall make the policy available to the public in each covered language in 
19 which the covered entity or service provider provides a product or service that is subject to 
20 the privacy policy or carries out activities related to that product or service. The policy must 
21 include, at a minimum, the following:
22 A.  The identity and the contact information of:
23 (1)  The covered entity or service provider to which the privacy policy applies, 
24 including the covered entity's or service provider's points of contact and general e-
25 mail addresses, as applicable, for privacy and data security inquiries; and
26 (2)  Another entity within the same corporate structure as the covered entity or 
27 service provider to which covered data is transferred by the covered entity;
28 B.  The categories of covered data that the covered entity or service provider collects 
29 or processes;

31 service provider collects or processes;
32 D.  Whether the covered entity or service provider transfers covered data and, if so, 
33 each category of service provider and 3rd party to which the covered entity or service 
34 provider transfers covered data; the name of each data broker to which the covered 
35 entity or service provider transfers covered data; and the purposes for which the data 
36 is transferred to the categories of service providers and 3rd parties except for a transfer 
37 to a governmental entity pursuant to a court order or law that prohibits the covered 
38 entity or service provider from disclosing the transfer;
39 E.  The length of time the covered entity or service provider intends to retain each 
40 category of covered data, including sensitive covered data, or, if it is not possible to 
41 identify the length of time, the criteria used to determine the length of time the covered 
42 entity or service provider intends to retain categories of covered data;
Page 11 - 131LR2156(01)1 F.  A prominent description of how an individual can exercise the rights described in 
2 this chapter;
3 G.  A general description of the covered entity's or service provider's data security 
4 practices; and
5 H.  The effective date of the privacy policy.
62. Changes to privacy policies.  If a covered entity makes a material change to its 
7 privacy policy, the covered entity shall notify each individual affected by the material 
8 change before implementing the material change with respect to prospectively collected 
9 covered data and, except as provided in subsection 9604, subsection 2, provide a reasonable 
10 opportunity for each individual to withdraw consent to further materially different 
11 collection, processing or transfer of previously collected covered data under the changed 
12 policy.  The covered entity shall take all reasonable electronic measures to provide direct 
13 notification regarding material changes to the privacy policy to each affected individual, in 
14 each covered language in which the privacy policy is made available, and taking into 
15 account available technology and the nature of the relationship.
163. Large data holders.  A large data holder shall retain copies of previous versions of 
17 its privacy policy for at least 10 years beginning after the effective date of this chapter and 
18 publish them on the large data holder's publicly accessible website.  A large data holder 
19 shall make publicly available, in a clear, conspicuous and readily accessible manner, a log 
20 describing the date and nature of each material change to its privacy policy over the past 
21 10 years.  The descriptions must be sufficient for a reasonable individual to understand the 
22 effect of each material change.  The obligations in this subsection do not apply to a previous 
23 version of a large data holder's privacy policy or a material change to a privacy policy that 
24 precede the effective date of this chapter.
25 In addition to the privacy policy required under subsection 1, a large data holder that is a 
26 covered entity shall provide a short-form notice of its covered data practices in a manner 
27 that is:
28 A.  Concise, clear, conspicuous and not misleading;
29 B.  Readily accessible to the individual, based on what is reasonably anticipated within 
30 the context of the relationship between the individual and the large data holder;
31 C.  Inclusive of an overview of individual rights and disclosures to draw attention to 
32 data practices that may be unexpected to a reasonable person or that involve sensitive 
33 covered data; and
34 D.  Not more than 500 words in length.
35ยง9609.  Affirmative consent
361. Valid consent.  An expression of consent in response to a request from a covered 
37 entity or service provider is not affirmative consent for purposes of this chapter unless the 
38 individual gives consent under the following conditions:
39 A.  The request is provided to the individual in a clear and conspicuous stand-alone 
40 disclosure made through the primary medium used to offer the covered entity's product 
41 or service, or, if the product or service is not offered in a medium that permits the 
42 making of the request under this paragraph, another medium regularly used in 
43 conjunction with the covered entity's product or service;
Page 12 - 131LR2156(01)1 B.  The request includes a description of the processing purpose for which the 
2 individual's consent is sought and:
3 (1)  Clearly states the specific categories of covered data that the covered entity 
4 intends to collect, process or transfer necessary to achieve the processing purpose; 
5 and
6 (2)  Includes a prominent heading and is written in language that would enable a 
7 reasonable individual to identify and understand the processing purpose for which 
8 consent is sought and the covered data to be collected, processed or transferred by 
9 the covered entity for the processing purpose;
10 C.  The request clearly explains the individual's rights related to consent;
11 D.  The request is made in a manner reasonably accessible to and usable by individuals 
12 with disabilities;
13 E.  The request is made available to the individual in each covered language in which 
14 the covered entity provides a product or service for which authorization is sought;
15 F.  The option to refuse to give consent is at least as prominent as the option to give 
16 consent and the option to refuse to give consent takes the same number of steps or 
17 fewer as the option to give consent; and
18 G.  Affirmative consent to an act or practice is not inferred from the inaction of the 
19 individual or the individual's continued use of a service or product provided by the 
20 covered entity.
212. Prohibitions.  A covered entity or service provider may not obtain or attempt to 
22 obtain affirmative consent through:
23 A.  The use of a false, fraudulent or materially misleading statement or representation; 
24 or
25 B.  The design, modification or manipulation of a user interface with the purpose or 
26 substantial effect of obscuring, subverting or impairing a reasonable individual's choice 
27 to provide consent or covered data.
283.  Different processing purpose.  Processing or transferring of covered data collected 
29 pursuant to affirmative consent for a different processing purpose than that for which 
30 affirmative consent was obtained requires affirmative consent for the subsequent 
31 processing purpose.
324. Withdrawal of consent.  A covered entity shall provide an individual with a clear 
33 and conspicuous means to withdraw affirmative consent previously provided by the 
34 individual that is as easy to execute by a reasonable individual as the means to provide 
35 consent.
365. Opt out.  A covered entity may not transfer or direct the transfer of the covered data 
37 of an individual to a 3rd party unless the individual provides affirmative consent and shall 
38 provide an opportunity for an individual to object to a transfer through an opt-out 
39 mechanism.  A covered entity is not required to provide an individual an opportunity to opt 
40 out of the collection, processing or transfer of covered data made pursuant to section 9604, 
41 subsection 2.
42ยง9610.  Targeted advertising
Page 13 - 131LR2156(01)11. Affirmative consent required.  Before engaging in targeted advertising to an 
2 individual or device, a covered entity or service provider that directly delivers a targeted 
3 advertisement shall obtain the individual's affirmative consent for targeted advertising.  The 
4 covered entity or service provider shall provide an opportunity for an individual to make 
5 an opt-out designation with respect to targeted advertising.  The covered entity or service 
6 provider shall abide by an opt-out designation made by the individual with respect to 
7 targeted advertising.  A covered entity or service provider that receives an opt-out 
8 designation made by an individual shall notify any other person that directed the covered 
9 entity or service provider to serve, deliver or otherwise handle the advertisement of the opt-
10 out designation.
112. Prohibitions.  A covered entity may not engage in targeted advertising to an 
12 individual if the covered entity:
13 A.  Is a covered high-impact social media company and knew or should have known 
14 the individual was a minor at the time of the advertising; 
15 B.  Is a large data holder and not a covered high-impact social media company and 
16 knew or acted in willful disregard of the fact that the individual was a minor at the time 
17 of the advertising; or
18 C.  Has knowledge that the individual was a minor at the time of the advertising.
19ยง9611.  Individual rights regarding covered data
201. Access.  Except as provided by this section, after receiving a request from an 
21 individual, a covered entity shall:
22 A.  Provide that individual with access to:
23 (1)  The individual's covered data, except covered data in a backup or archival 
24 system, that is collected, processed or transferred by the covered entity or a service 
25 provider of the covered entity within the 24 months preceding the request, in a 
26 format that a reasonable individual can understand and download from the Internet; 
27 and
28 (2)  If applicable:
29 (a)  The categories of 3rd parties to which the covered entity has transferred 
30 for consideration the covered data of the individual; 
31 (b)  An option for consumers to obtain the names of 3rd parties or service 
32 providers to which the covered entity has transferred for consideration the 
33 covered data of the individual;
34 (c)  The categories of sources from which the covered data was collected; and 
35 (d)  A description of the purpose for which the covered entity transferred the 
36 covered data of the individual to a 3rd party or service provider;
37 B.  Correct a verifiable substantial inaccuracy or substantially incomplete information 
38 with respect to the covered data of the individual that is processed by the covered entity 
39 and make reasonable efforts to notify all 3rd parties or service providers to which the 
40 covered entity transferred the covered data of the corrected information.  A small 
41 business may delete the relevant information instead of making a correction;
Page 14 - 131LR2156(01)1 C.  Delete covered data of the individual that is processed by the covered entity and 
2 make reasonable efforts to notify all 3rd parties or service providers to which the 
3 covered entity transferred the covered data of the individual's deletion request; and
4 D.  To the extent technically feasible, export to the individual or directly to another 
5 entity the covered data of the individual that is processed by the covered entity, 
6 including inferences linked or reasonably linkable to the individual but not including 
7 derived data:
8 (1)  Without licensing restrictions that limit transfers;
9 (2)  In a format that a reasonable individual can understand and download from the 
10 Internet; and
11 (3)  In a portable, structured, interoperable and machine-readable format.
12 A small business is not required to comply with subparagraph (2) or (3). 
132. Conditions.  A covered entity may not condition, effectively condition, attempt to 
14 condition or attempt to effectively condition an action required in subsection 1 through:
15 A.  The use of a false, fraudulent or materially misleading statement or representation; 
16 or
17 B.  The design, modification or manipulation of a user interface with the purpose or 
18 substantial effect of obscuring, subverting or impairing a reasonable individual's 
19 choice.
203. Response periods.  A covered entity or service provider shall comply with a request 
21 to perform an action under subsection 1 within the following response periods:
22 A.  For a large data holder, no later than the 45th day after the date of the request by an 
23 individual, unless it is demonstrably impracticable or impracticably costly to verify the 
24 identity of the individual; or
25 B.  For a covered entity that is not a large data holder, no later than the 60th day after 
26 the date of the request by an individual, unless it is demonstrably impracticable or 
27 impracticably costly to verify the identity of the individual.
28 A response period described in this subsection may be extended once by 45 additional days 
29 when reasonably necessary, considering the complexity and number of the individual's 
30 requests, as long as the covered entity informs the individual of the extension within the 
31 initial 45-day or 60-day response period, together with the reason for the extension.
324. Multiple requests from one individual.  A covered entity shall perform the actions 
33 described in subsection 1 free of charge with respect to the first 2 times that an individual 
34 makes a request in a 12-month period.  Beyond the first 2 requests in a 12-month period, 
35 the covered entity or service provider may charge a reasonable fee for each request.
365. Verification.  If a covered entity cannot reasonably verify that a request to take an 
37 action under subsection 1 is made by the individual whose covered data is the subject of 
38 the request, or an individual authorized to make a request on the individual's behalf, the 
39 covered entity:
40 A.  May request that the individual making the request provide additional information 
41 necessary for the sole purpose of verifying the identity of the individual; and
Page 15 - 131LR2156(01)1 B.  May not process or transfer additional information provided under paragraph A for 
2 any other purpose.
36. Exceptions.  A covered entity is not required to take an action described by 
4 subsection 1 if:
5 A.  The covered entity cannot reasonably verify that the individual making the request 
6 is the individual whose covered data is the subject of the request or an individual 
7 authorized to make a request on the individual's behalf;
8 B.  The covered entity reasonably believes that:
9 (1)  The request is made to interfere with a contract between the covered entity and 
10 another individual;
11 (2)  The action would require the covered entity to engage in an unfair or deceptive 
12 practice under 15 United States Code, Section 45 or state law; or
13 (3)  The request is made to further fraud or support criminal activity or the action 
14 presents a data security threat;
15 C.  The covered entity determines that the action would require access to or correction 
16 of another individual's sensitive data; or
17 D.  The action:
18 (1)  Requires the covered entity to retain covered data collected for a single, one-
19 time transaction, if that covered data is not processed or transferred by the covered 
20 entity for any purpose other than completing the transaction;
21 (2)  Is demonstrably impracticable or prohibitively costly to take, in which case the 
22 covered entity shall provide a description to the requestor detailing the inability to 
23 comply with the request.  The receipt of a large number of verified requests, on its 
24 own, may not be considered to render compliance with a request demonstrably 
25 impracticable;
26 (3)  Requires the covered entity to attempt to re-identify de-identified data;
27 (4)  Requires the covered entity to maintain covered data in an identifiable form or 
28 collect, retain or access data in order to be capable of associating a request with the 
29 covered data of the individual who made the request;
30 (5)  Would result in the release of privileged or confidential business information;
31 (6)  Requires the covered entity to correct covered data that cannot be reasonably 
32 verified as being inaccurate or incomplete;
33 (7) Violates federal or state law or the rights of another individual, including the 
34 rights under the United States Constitution;
35 (8)  Prevents a covered entity from being able to maintain a confidential record of 
36 deletion requests, maintained solely for the purpose of preventing covered data of 
37 an individual from being recollected after the individual submitted a deletion 
38 request and requested that the covered entity no longer collect, process or transfer 
39 the data; or
40 (9)  With respect to a request for deletion:
Page 16 - 131LR2156(01)1 (a)  Would unreasonably interfere with the provision of products or services 
2 by the covered entity to another person it currently serves;
3 (b)  Would require the deletion of covered data that relates to a public figure, 
4 public official or limited-purpose public feature and for which the requesting 
5 individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to that 
6 covered data;
7 (c)  Would require the deletion of covered data reasonably necessary to 
8 perform a contract between the covered entity and the individual;
9 (d)  Would require the deletion of covered data that the covered entity needs 
10 to retain in order to comply with professional ethical obligations;
11 (e)  Would require the deletion of covered data that the covered entity 
12 reasonably believes may be evidence of unlawful activity or an abuse of the 
13 covered entity's products or services; or
14 (f)  For private elementary and secondary schools and private institutions of 
15 higher education as defined by Title I of the federal Higher Education Act of 
16 1965, would require the deletion of covered data that would unreasonably 
17 interfere with the provision of education services by or the ordinary operation 
18 of the school or institution.
19 With respect to a request that is subject to an exception described by this subsection, a 
20 covered entity shall partially comply with the remainder of the request if it is possible and 
21 not unduly burdensome to do so.
227. Languages.  A covered entity shall provide an opportunity to make a request under 
23 this section in a covered language in which the covered entity provides a product or service.  
24 The mechanisms by which a covered entity enables individuals to make requests under this 
25 section must be readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities.
268. Transfer of certain covered data.  A covered entity may not transfer or direct the 
27 transfer of the covered data of a minor to a 3rd party if the covered entity has knowledge 
28 that the individual is a minor and has not obtained affirmative consent from the minor or 
29 the minor's parent or guardian.  A covered entity or service provider may collect, process 
30 or transfer covered data of an individual the covered entity or service provider knows is a 
31 minor in order to submit information relating to child victimization to law enforcement 
32 agencies or to the nonprofit, national resource center and clearinghouse designated by the 
33 United States Congress to assist victims, families, child-serving professionals and the 
34 general public on issues pertaining to missing and exploited children.
35ยง9612.  Requirements for large data holders

5 B.  Disclose by July 1st of each applicable calendar year the information compiled in 
6 paragraph A within the large data holder's privacy policy or on the publicly accessible 
7 website of the large data holder that is accessible from a hyperlink included in the 
8 privacy policy.
92. Certification.  An executive officer of a large data holder shall certify annually, in 
10 good faith, to the Attorney General that the entity maintains:
11 A.  Internal controls reasonably designed to comply with this chapter; and
12 B.  Internal reporting structures to ensure that the certifying executive officer is 
13 involved in and responsible for the decisions that impact the compliance by the large 
14 data holder with this chapter.
15 A certification submitted under this subsection must be based on a review of the 
16 effectiveness of the internal controls and reporting structures of the large data holder that 
17 is conducted by the certifying executive officer not earlier than the 90th day before the date 
18 of the submission of the certification.  A certification is made in good faith if the certifying 
19 executive officer, after a reasonable investigation, had reasonable grounds to believe and 
20 did believe, at the time that certification was submitted, that the statements in the 
21 certification were true and that there was no omission of a material fact or a fact necessary 
22 to make the statements in the certification not misleading.
23ยง9613.  Data brokers
241. Notice required.  A data broker shall place a clear, conspicuous, not misleading and 
25 readily accessible notice on the publicly accessible website or mobile application of the

30 a calendar year during which a covered entity acted as a data broker and processed covered 
31 data pertaining to more than 5,000 individuals or devices that identify or are linked or 
32 reasonably linkable to an individual, the covered entity shall register with the Attorney 
33 General in accordance with this subsection. In registering with the Attorney General, a data

5 searchable central registry of data brokers that are registered with the Attorney General.
6 A data broker that fails to register or provide the notice as required under this subsection is 
7 liable for a civil penalty of $100 for each day the data broker fails to register or provide 
8 notice as required under this subsection, not to exceed a total of $10,000 per year, and an 
9 amount equal to the registration fees due under this section for each year that the data broker 
10 failed to register as required pursuant to this section.
11ยง9614.  Discrimination prohibited
121. Discrimination prohibited.  A covered entity or a service provider may not collect, 
13 process or transfer covered data in a manner that discriminates against individuals, or 
14 otherwise makes unavailable the equal enjoyment of goods or services, on the basis of race, 
15 color, religion, national origin, sex or disability.
162. Exceptions.  This section does not apply to:
17 A.  The collection, processing or transfer of covered data for the purpose of:

19 unlawful discrimination; or
20 (2)  Diversifying an applicant, participant or customer pool; or
21 B.  A private establishment, as described in 42 United States Code, Section 2000a(e).
22ยง9615.  Algorithms
231. Assessment required.  A covered entity that is not a small business and that uses a 
24 covered algorithm in a manner that poses a consequential risk of harm to an individual or 
25 group of individuals and uses the covered algorithm solely or in part to collect, process or 
26 transfer covered data or publicly available data annually shall conduct an impact 
27 assessment of the algorithm. The impact assessment must include the following 
28 information:
29 A.  A detailed description of the design process and methodologies of the covered 
30 algorithm;
31 B.  A statement of the purpose and reasonably foreseeable uses of the covered

7 individuals, including race, color, religion, national origin, sex or disability;
8 (4)  Disparate impact on the basis of individuals' race, color, religion, national 
9 origin, sex or disability status; or
10 (5)  Disparate impact on the basis of individuals' political party registration status; 
11 and
12 G.  Any other information as required by the Attorney General.
132. Design evaluation.  A covered entity or service provider that develops a covered 
14 algorithm that is designed to collect, process or transfer covered data shall perform, before 
15 deploying the covered algorithm, an algorithmic design evaluation to evaluate the design, 
16 structure and inputs of the covered algorithm, including training data used to develop the 
17 covered algorithm, to reduce the risk of the potential harms identified under this section.
183. Focus.  In complying with this section, a covered entity and a service provider may 
19 focus the impact assessment or evaluation on a covered algorithm, or portions of a covered 
20 algorithm, that will be put to use and may reasonably contribute to the risk of the potential 
21 harms identified under this section.
224. Report.  No later than 30 days after completing an impact assessment or evaluation 
23 under this section, a covered entity or a service provider shall submit a report of the impact 
24 assessment or evaluation to the Attorney General.  The report must include a summary of

26 the summary publicly available in a place that is easily accessible to consumers. Covered 
27 entities and service providers may redact a trade secret, as defined in 18 United States Code, 
28 Section 1839(3), or other confidential or proprietary information, from the report.
29ยง9616.  Data security
301. Practices and procedures.  A covered entity or service provider shall establish, 
31 implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical data security 
32 practices and procedures to protect covered data against unauthorized access.  The practices 
33 must be appropriate to:
34 A.  The size and complexity of the covered entity or service provider;
35 B.  The nature and scope of the covered entity or the service provider's collecting, 
36 processing or transferring of covered data;

18 implementing administrative, technical or physical safeguards or changes to data 
19 security practices or the architecture, installation or implementation of network or 
20 operating software;
21 D.  Disposing of covered data in accordance with a retention schedule that requires the 
22 deletion of covered data when the data is required to be deleted by law or is no longer 
23 necessary for the purpose for which the data was collected, processed or transferred, 
24 unless an individual has provided affirmative consent to that retention.  Disposal may 
25 include destroying, permanently erasing or otherwise modifying the covered data to 
26 make the data permanently unreadable or indecipherable and unrecoverable to ensure 
27 ongoing compliance with this section.  A service provider shall establish practices to 
28 delete or return covered data to a covered entity as requested at the end of the provision 
29 of services unless retention of the covered data is required by law;
30 E.  Training each employee with access to covered data on how to safeguard covered 
31 data and updating the training as necessary;
32 F.  Designating an officer or employee to maintain and implement the practices

7 described in subsection 1 to report directly to the highest official at the large data holder as 
8 a privacy protection officer who, in addition to the requirements in subsection 2, either 
9 directly or through a supervised designee, shall:
10 A.  Establish processes to periodically review and update the privacy and security 
11 policies, practices and procedures of the large data holder, as necessary;
12 B.  Conduct biennial and comprehensive audits to ensure that the policies, practices 
13 and procedures of the large data holder ensure the large data holder is in compliance 
14 with this chapter and ensure the audits are accessible to the Attorney General upon 
15 request;

23 conduct a privacy impact assessment every other year.  The assessment must weigh the 
24 benefits of the covered entity's covered data collecting, processing and transfer practices 
25 that may cause a substantial privacy risk against the potential material adverse 
26 consequences of the practices to individual privacy.  The covered entity shall make a 
27 summary of the privacy impact assessment publicly available in a place that is easily 
28 accessible and available to the Attorney General on request.  The privacy impact 
29 assessment must:

31 (1)  The nature of the covered data collected, processed and transferred by the 
32 covered entity;
33 (2)  The volume of the covered data collected, processed and transferred by the 
34 covered entity; and
35 (3)  The potential risks posed to the privacy of individuals by the collecting,

37 B.  Be in written form and maintained by the covered entity unless rendered out of date 
38 by a subsequent assessment;
39 C.  Include additional information required by the Attorney General; and
40 D.  If the covered entity is a large data holder, be approved by the privacy protection 
41 officer.
Page 22 - 131LR2156(01)1ยง9618.  Service providers
21. Contract.  A service provider shall follow the instructions of a covered entity and 
3 may only collect, process and transfer service provider data to the extent necessary and 
4 proportionate to provide a service requested by the covered entity, as set out in the contract 
5 between the covered entity and the service provider.  A service provider is not required to 
6 collect, process or transfer covered data if the service provider would not otherwise do so.  
7 A person may only act as a service provider pursuant to a written contract between the 
8 covered entity and the service provider, or a written contract between one service provider 
9 and a second service provider if the contract:
10 A.  Clearly sets forth:
11 (1)  The data processing procedures of the service provider with respect to 
12 collection, processing or transfer performed on behalf of the covered entity or 
13 service provider;
14 (2)  Instructions for collecting, processing or transferring data;
15 (3)  The nature and purpose of collecting, processing or transferring data;
16 (4)  The type of data subject to collecting, processing or transferring;
17 (5)  The duration of processing; and

19 service provider shall notify the covered entity of material changes to its privacy 
20 practices;
21 B.  Does not relieve a covered entity or a service provider of a requirement or liability 
22 imposed on a covered entity or service provider under this chapter; and
23 C.  Prohibits:
24 (1)  Collecting, processing or transferring covered data in contravention to the 
25 requirements set forth under paragraph A; and
26 (2)  Combining service provider data with covered data which the service provider 
27 receives from or on behalf of another person or collects from the interaction of the 
28 service provider with an individual, provided that the combining is not necessary 
29 to achieve a purpose described in subsection 9604, subsection 2 and is otherwise 
30 permitted under a required contract.
31 A service provider shall retain copies of previous contracts entered into in compliance with 
32 this subsection with each covered entity to which it provides requested products or services.
332. Prohibition on certain actions.  A service provider may not collect, process or 
34 transfer service provider data if the service provider has actual knowledge that a covered 
35 entity violated this chapter with respect to that data.
363. Assisting covered entity. A service provider shall assist a covered entity in 
37 responding to a request made by an individual regarding service provider data, by either:
38 A.  Providing appropriate technical and organizational measures, taking into account 
39 the nature of the processing and the information reasonably available to the service 
40 provider, for the covered entity to comply with the request for service provider data; or
Page 23 - 131LR2156(01)1 B.  Fulfilling a request by a covered entity by either complying with the request 
2 pursuant to the covered entity's instructions or providing written verification to the 
3 covered entity that:
4 (1)  The service provider does not hold covered data related to the request; 
5 (2)  Complying with the request would be inconsistent with its legal obligations; 
6 or
7 (3)  The request falls within an exception to section 9611.
84. Engagement of other service providers.  A service provider may engage another 
9 service provider for purposes of processing service provider data on behalf of a covered 
10 entity only after providing that covered entity with notice and pursuant to a written contract 
11 that requires the other service provider to satisfy the obligations of the original service 
12 provider with respect to the service provider data, including that the other service provider 
13 be treated as a service provider under this chapter.
145. Compliance information.  In response to a reasonable request by a covered entity, 
15 a service provider shall make available to the covered entity information necessary to 
16 demonstrate the compliance of the service provider with the requirements of this chapter, 
17 including a report of an independent assessment arranged by the service provider on terms 
18 agreed to by the service provider and the covered entity, provide information necessary to 
19 enable the covered entity to conduct and document a privacy impact assessment required 
20 under this chapter and make available the algorithmic design evaluation required under 
21 section 9615.
226. Deletion or return of covered data.  At the covered entity's direction, a service 
23 provider shall delete or return all covered data to the covered entity at the end of the 
24 provision of services, unless retention of the covered data is required by law.
257. Safeguards.  A service provider shall develop, implement and maintain reasonable 
26 administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are designed to protect the security 
27 and confidentiality of covered data the service provider processes consistent with section 
28 9616.
298. Assessments.  A service provider shall allow and cooperate with reasonable 
30 assessments by the covered entity or the covered entity's designated assessor.  The service 
31 provider may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of 
32 the service provider's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the 
33 obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or 
34 framework and assessment procedure for the assessments.  The service provider shall 
35 provide a report of the assessment to the covered entity on request.
369. Service provider relationship determination.  Determining whether a person is 
37 acting as a covered entity or service provider with respect to a specific processing of 
38 covered data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which that data 
39 is processed.  A person that is not limited in the person's processing of covered data 
40 pursuant to the instructions of a covered entity, or that fails to adhere to those instructions, 
41 is a covered entity and not a service provider with respect to a specific processing of 
42 covered data.  A service provider that continues to adhere to the instructions of a covered 
43 entity with respect to a specific processing of covered data remains a service provider.  If 
44 a service provider begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means 
Page 24 - 131LR2156(01)45 of the processing of covered data, it is a covered entity and not a service provider with 
46 respect to the processing of that data.
310. Liability.  A covered entity that transfers covered data to a service provider or a 
4 service provider that transfers covered data to a covered entity or another service provider, 
5 in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, is not liable for a violation of this 
6 chapter by the service provider or covered entity to which the covered data was transferred, 
7 if at the time of transferring the covered data, the covered entity or service provider did not 
8 have knowledge that the service provider or covered entity would violate this chapter.  A 
9 covered entity or service provider that receives covered data in compliance with the 
10 requirements of this chapter is not in violation of this Act as a result of a violation by a 
11 covered entity or service provider from which that data was received.
1211. Due diligence required.  A covered entity or service provider shall exercise 
13 reasonable due diligence in selecting a service provider.
1412. Service provided to government entities.  Solely for the purposes of this section, 
15 the requirements for service providers to contract with, assist and follow the instructions of 
16 covered entities must include requirements to contract with, assist and follow the 
17 instructions of a government entity if the service provider is providing a service to a 
18 government entity.
19ยง9619.  Third parties
201. Processing.  A 3rd party may not process 3rd-party data for a processing purpose 
21 other than, in the case of sensitive data and covered data, the processing purpose for which 
22 the individual gave affirmative consent or to effect a purpose enumerated in section 9604, 
23 subsection 2, paragraph A, C or E and, in the case of nonsensitive data, the processing 
24 purpose for which the covered entity made a disclosure pursuant to section 9608, subsection 
25 1, paragraph D.  A 3rd party may reasonably rely on representations made by the covered 
26 entity that transferred the 3rd-party data if the 3rd party conducts reasonable due diligence 
27 on the representations of the covered entity and finds those representations to be credible.
282. Contract required.  A covered entity that transfers covered data to a 3rd party shall 
29 enter into a written contract with the 3rd party that:
30 A.  Identifies the specific purposes for which the covered data is being made available 
31 to the 3rd party;
32 B.  Specifies that the covered entity is transferring the covered data to the 3rd party 
33 solely for the specific purposes set forth in the contract and that the 3rd party may only 
34 use the covered data for those specific purposes; and
35 C.  Requires the 3rd party to comply with all applicable provisions of and rules adopted 
36 under this chapter with respect to the covered data that the covered entity transfers to 
37 the 3rd party and to provide the same level of privacy and security protection for the 
38 covered data as required by covered entities under this chapter.
393. Due diligence required.  A covered entity or service provider shall exercise 
40 reasonable due diligence in deciding to transfer covered data to a 3rd party.
41ยง9620.  Enforcement1
2
Page 25 - 131LR2156(01)11. By government official.  The Attorney General, a district attorney or a counsel for 
2 a municipality may bring a civil action in the name of the State or on behalf of the residents 
3 of the State against a covered entity or service provider that violates this chapter to:
4 A. Enjoin the act or practice that is in violation of this chapter;
5 B. Enforce compliance with this chapter or a rule adopted under this chapter;
6 C. Obtain damages, civil penalties, restitution or other compensation on behalf of the 
7 residents of the State; or
8 D. Obtain reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred.
92. By individual.  A violation of this chapter or a rule adopted under this chapter with 
10 respect to the covered data of an individual constitutes an injury to that individual.  The 
11 injured individual may bring a civil action against the party that commits the violation, 
12 except that an individual may not bring a civil action against a small business. In a civil 
13 action brought under this subsection in which a plaintiff prevails, the court may award the 
14 plaintiff:
15 A.  Damages in an amount not less than $5,000 per individual per violation, as adjusted 
16 annually to reflect an increase in the Consumer Price Index, or actual damages, 
17 whichever is greater;
18 B.  Punitive damages;
19 C.  Injunctive relief;
20 D.  Declaratory relief; and
21 E.  Reasonable attorney's fees and litigation costs.
223. Arbitration agreement or waiver.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the 
23 contrary, no predispute arbitration agreement or predispute joint-action waiver is valid or 
24 enforceable with respect to a dispute arising under this chapter.  A determination as to 
25 whether this subsection applies to a dispute must be made by a court, rather than an 
26 arbitrator, without regard to whether an applicable agreement purports to delegate that 
27 determination to an arbitrator.  For purposes of this subsection, "predispute arbitration 
28 agreement" means an agreement to arbitrate a dispute that has not arisen at the time of the 
29 making of the agreement and "predispute joint-action waiver" means an agreement that 
30 would prohibit a party from participating in a joint, class or collective action in a judicial, 
31 arbitral, administrative or other forum, concerning a dispute that has not yet arisen at the 
32 time of the making of the agreement.
33Sec. 2.  Deadlines for certain actions. The first algorithm assessment or design 
34 evaluation required by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 9615 is required to be 
35 completed not later than the 2nd anniversary of the effective date of this Act.  The first 
36 certification required by Title 10, section 9612, subsection 2 and the first privacy impact 
37 assessment required by Title 10, section 9617, subsection 4 are required to be completed 
38 not later than the first anniversary of the effective date of this Act.
39Sec. 3.  Effective date.  This Act takes effect 180 days after the adjournment of the  
40 First Special Session of the 131st Legislature.
