Page 1 - 131LR0698(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current law requires that by April 1, 2023 a covered employer with 25 or 
4 more covered employees must offer the Maine Retirement Savings Program to its covered 
5 employees; and
6Whereas, current law requires that by October 1, 2023 a covered employer with 15 
7 to 24 covered employees must offer the Maine Retirement Savings Program to its covered 
8 employees; and
9Whereas, current law sets forth penalties for covered employers that fail to comply 
10 with the law; and
11Whereas, the Maine Retirement Savings Program will not be implemented in time 
12 for employers to offer the program on April 1, 2023 or October 1, 2023; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore,
17Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §172, first ¶, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 356, §1, is amended to 
19 read:
20 The Maine Retirement Savings Board is established as a body corporate and politic and 
21 a public instrumentality of the State pursuant to section 12004‑G, subsection 33‑G to 
22 develop and maintain the Maine Retirement Savings Program for individuals employed or 
23 self-employed for wages or other compensation in this State.
24Sec. 2.  5 MRSA §172, sub-§8, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 356, §1, is amended to 
25 read:
268.  Meetings.  The board shall meet monthly  at such times as established by policy of 
27 the board, but at least quarterly, beginning no later than May 2022 and may also meet at 
28 other times at the call of the chair. All meetings of the board are public proceedings within 
29 the meaning of Title 1, chapter 13, subchapter 1.
30Sec. 3.  5 MRSA §173, sub-§1, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 356, §1, is amended 
31 to read:
32 A.  Develop, establish, implement and maintain the program and, to that end, may 
33 conduct market, legal and feasibility analyses if the board considers them advisable 
34 and may determine a name for the program;
35Sec. 4.  5 MRSA §173, sub-§1, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 356, §1, is amended 
36 to read:
37 E.  Develop and implement an investment policy that defines the program's investment 
38 objectives consistent with the objectives of the program and that provides for policies 
39 and procedures consistent with those investment objectives. The board shall strive to 
40 select and offer investment options available to participants and other program features 
41 that are intended to achieve maximum possible income replacement balanced with an 
Page 2 - 131LR0698(01)42 appropriate level of risk in an IRA-based environment consistent with the investment 
43 objectives under the policy. The investment options may encompass a range of risk and 
44 return opportunities and allow for a rate of return commensurate with an appropriate 
45 level of risk in view of the investment objectives under the policy. The menu of 
46 investment options must be determined by considering the nature and objectives of the 
47 program, the desirability based on behavioral research findings of limiting investment 
48 options under the program to a reasonable number and the extensive investment options 
49 available to participants in the event that they roll over funds in an IRA established 
50 under the program to an IRA outside the program.  In accordance with paragraphs K 
51 and O, the board, in carrying out its responsibilities and exercising its powers under 
52 this chapter, shall employ or retain appropriate entities or personnel to assist or advise 
53 it and to whom to delegate the carrying out of such responsibilities and exercise of such 
54 powers;
14Sec. 5.  5 MRSA §173, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 356, §1, is amended to 
15 read:
162.  Required elements of program.  In accordance with the implementation dates  
17 schedule set forth in subsection 3, the program must:
18 A.  Allow an eligible individual in this State to choose whether or not to contribute to 
19 an IRA under the program, including allowing a covered employee in the State the 
20 choice to contribute to an IRA under the program through a payroll deduction IRA 
21 arrangement;
22 B.  Notwithstanding any provision of state law related to payroll deduction to the 
23 contrary, require each covered employer to offer its covered employees the choice 
24 whether or not to contribute to a payroll deduction IRA by automatically enrolling them 
25 in the payroll deduction IRA with the opportunity to opt out.  A covered employee who 
26 is not a participant because that employee has opted out will be automatically 
27 reenrolled with the opportunity to opt out again at regular or ad hoc intervals 
28 determined by the board in its discretion, but not more frequently than annually;
29 C.  Provide that the IRA to which contributions are made is a Roth IRA, except that 
30 the board has the authority at any time, in its discretion, to add an option for all 
31 participants to affirmatively elect to contribute to a traditional IRA as an alternative to 
32 the Roth IRA;
33 D.  Provide that, unless otherwise specified by the covered employee, a covered 
34 employee must automatically initially contribute 5% of the covered employee's salary 
35 or wages to the program and may elect to opt out of the program at any time or 
36 contribute at any higher or lower rate, expressed as a percentage of salary or wages, or, 
37 if the board in its discretion permits, expressed as a flat dollar amount, subject in all 
38 cases to the IRA contribution and income eligibility limits applicable under the Internal 
39 Revenue Code at no additional charge. The board is authorized to change, from time 
40 to time, the 5% automatic initial default contribution rate for all covered employees in 
41 its discretion;
42 E.  Provide on a uniform basis, if and when the board so determines in its discretion, 
43 for an annual increase of each participant's contribution rate, by not more than 1% of 
44 salary or wages per year up to a maximum of 8%  10%.  Any such increases must apply 
45 to participants, as determined by the board in its discretion, either by default or only if 1

Page 3 - 131LR0698(01)46 initiated by affirmative participant election and are in either case subject to the IRA 
47 contribution and income eligibility limits applicable under the Internal Revenue Code;
3 F.  Provide for direct deposit of contributions into investments under the program, 
4 including, but not limited to, a default investment such as a series of target date funds 
5 and a limited number of investment alternatives including a principal preservation 
6 option determined by the board. In addition, the board may provide that each 
7 participant's initial contributions, up to a specified dollar amount or for a specified 
8 period of time, are required to be invested in a principal  capital preservation investment 
9 or, in the board's discretion, must be defaulted into such an investment unless the 
10 participant affirmatively opts for a different investment for those contributions. The 
11 board shall determine how often participants will have the opportunity to change their 
12 selections of investments for future contributions or existing balances or both;
13 G.  Provide that employer contributions by a covered employer are not required or 
14 permitted;
15 H.  Be professionally managed;
16 I.  When possible and practicable, use existing employer and public infrastructure to 
17 facilitate contributions, record keeping and outreach and use pooled or collective 
18 investment arrangements for amounts contributed to the program;
19 J.  Require the maintenance of separate records and accounting for each account under 
20 the program and allow for participants to maintain their accounts regardless of place of 
21 employment and to roll over funds into other IRAs or other retirement accounts;
22 K.  Provide for reports on the status of each participant's account to be provided to each 
23 participant at least annually and make best efforts to provide each participant frequent 
24 or continual online access to information on the status of that participant's account;
25 L.  Provide that each participant owns the contributions to and earnings on amounts 
26 contributed to the participant's account under the program and that the State and 
27 covered employers have no proprietary interest in those contributions or earnings;
28 M.  Be designed and implemented in a manner consistent with federal law to the extent 
29 that it applies and consistent with the program not being preempted by, and the payroll 
30 deduction IRAs and covered employers not being subject to, ERISA;
31 N.  Promote expanded retirement saving by encouraging employers in the State that 
32 would otherwise be covered employers to instead adopt a specified tax-favored 
33 retirement plan;
34 O.  Make provision for participation in the program by individuals who are not 
35 employees, such as self-employed individuals and independent contractors, as 
36 provided in rules adopted pursuant to section 174, subsection 2;
37 P.  Seek to keep fees, costs and expenses of the program as low as practicable, except 
38 that any administrative fee imposed on a covered employee for participating in the 
39 program may not exceed a reasonable amount relative to fees charged by similar 
40 established programs in other states.  The fee may be an asset-based or investment 
41 return fee, flat fee or hybrid of the permissible fee structures identified in this 
42 paragraph;1
2
Page 4 - 131LR0698(01)1 Q.  Adopt rules and establish procedures governing the distribution of funds from the 
2 program, including such distributions as may be permitted or required by the program 
3 and any applicable provisions of tax laws, with the objectives of maximizing financial 
4 security in retirement, helping to protect spousal rights and assisting participants with 
5 the challenges of decumulation of savings. The board has the authority to provide for 
6 one or more reasonably priced distribution options to provide a source of regular 
7 retirement income, including income for life or for the participant's life expectancy or 
8 for joint lives and life expectancies, as applicable;
9 R.  Adopt rules and establish procedures promoting portability of benefits, including 
10 the ability to make tax-free rollovers or transfers from IRAs under the program to other 
11 IRAs or to tax-qualified plans that accept such rollovers or transfers;
12 S.  Establish penalties in accordance with subsection 4 for a covered employer that fails 
13 without reasonable cause to enroll a covered employee in the program as required or 
14 that fails to transmit a payroll deduction IRA contribution to the program as required. 
15 A lack of reasonable cause is established by the failure to enroll after the program 
16 communicates with the employer 3 times;
17 T.  In accordance with subsection 1, paragraph C, use private sector entities to 
18 administer the program and invest the contributions to the program under the 
19 supervision and guidance of the board; and
20 U.  Allow the board to provide for the establishment, maintenance, administration, 
21 operation and implementation of the program to be carried out jointly with, or in 
22 partnership, collaboration, coordination or alliance with one or more other states, the 
23 Federal Government or any federal, state or local agencies or instrumentalities.

25 the following enacted in its place:

28 factors.  A covered employer shall offer the program to its covered employees no later than 
29 December 31, 2024.
30 A covered employer with fewer than 5 employees is not required to offer the program to 
31 its covered employees but may offer the program to its employees at the option of the 
32 employer and in accordance with rules established by the board.
33Sec. 7.  5 MRSA §173, sub-§4, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 356, §1, is amended 
34 to read:
35 A.  If a covered employer fails to enroll a covered employee without reasonable cause,

38 enrolled in the program or had not opted out of participation in the program and, for 
39 each calendar year beginning after the date on which a penalty has been assessed with 
40 respect to a covered employee, is subject to a penalty for any portion of that calendar 
41 year during which the covered employee continues to be unenrolled without opting out 
42 of participation in the program. The amount of any penalty imposed on a covered 
43 employer for the failure to enroll a covered employee without reasonable cause is 
44 determined as follows:
Page 5 - 131LR0698(01)1 (1)  Prior to April 1, 2024  From July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026, the maximum

11 C.  A penalty may not be imposed on a covered employer for any failure to enroll a 
12 covered employee if the covered employer exercised reasonable diligence to meet the 
13 requirements of this chapter and the covered employer complies with those 
14 requirements with respect to each covered employee by the end of the 90-day period 
15 beginning on the first date the covered employer knew, or exercising reasonable
