41.  Small modular nuclear reactor or modular reactor defined.  As used in this 
5 section, unless the context otherwise indicates, "small modular nuclear reactor" or 
6 "modular reactor" means a nuclear reactor that:
7 A. Has a rated generating capacity of no more than 350 megawatts;
8 B.  Is capable of being constructed and operated at a single site on its own or in 
9 combination with one or more nuclear reactors; and
10 C.  Is required to be licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
112.  Requests for proposals for information.  By October 1st of each year, the 
12 commission shall issue a request for proposals soliciting informational bids regarding the 
13 operation in this State of a small modular nuclear reactor.  The informational bids must 
14 include the costs of establishing a modular reactor in the State, either through manufacture 
15 on-site or transport into the State, the proposed location of a modular reactor, the time 
16 needed to establish a modular reactor in the State, the annual operational costs of a modular 
17 reactor and any other information the commission determines necessary.  The bids are not 
18 binding on the State or the person submitting the bid but may be used to inform and develop 
19 a contract for the establishment in the State of a modular reactor. 
203.  Annual report.  Beginning in 2024, by January 15th annually, the commission shall 
21 submit to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy 
22 and utility matters a report regarding the informational bids received by the commission 
23 pursuant to its requests for proposals made pursuant to subsection 2.  The joint standing 
24 committee may report out legislation based on the report.
254.  Termination.  This section is repealed January 1, 2034 or when the State accepts a 
26 bid for the placement of a small modular nuclear reactor, whichever occurs first.
27SUMMARY

31 megawatts, is capable of being constructed and operated at a single site on its own or in 
32 combination with one or more nuclear reactors and is required to be licensed by the United 
33 States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The requests are for information only, including 
34 the timing for establishing a modular reactor and the cost, location and annual operating 
35 costs of a modular reactor, and are not binding on the State or the person submitting the 
36 information, but may be used in developing a contract.  The commission is required to 
37 make an annual report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
38 over energy and utility matters detailing the informational bids received.28
