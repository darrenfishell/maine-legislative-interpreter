182.  Uninsured patients.  Upon the request of an uninsured patient, a health care entity 
19 shall provide within a reasonable time of the request an estimate of the total price of medical 
20 services to be rendered directly by that health care entity during a single medical encounter.  
21 If the health care entity is unable to provide an accurate estimate of the total price of a 
22 specific medical service because the amount of the medical service to be consumed during 
23 the medical encounter is unknown in advance, the health care entity shall provide a brief 
24 description of the basis for determining the total price of that particular medical service.  If 
25 a single medical encounter will involve medical services to be rendered by one or more 
26 3rd-party health care entities, the health care entity shall identify each 3rd-party health care 
27 entity to enable the uninsured patient to seek an estimate of the total price of medical 
28 services to be rendered directly by each health care entity to that patient. When providing 
29 an estimate as required by this subsection, a health care entity shall also notify the uninsured 
30 patient of any charity care policy adopted by the health care entity.
313. All patients; medical offices and laboratories.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, 
32 prior to the provision of health care, including laboratory services, in a medical office or 
33 by a laboratory, a health care practitioner or laboratory shall inform a patient of the cost of 
34 such care or services.  Health care and laboratory costs include but are not limited to 
35 professional service fees, facility fees and any other fees or costs associated with the 
36 provision of the health care or laboratory service to the patient.

6 one year earlier is not obligated to pay the bill.  The health care entity may not initiate a
