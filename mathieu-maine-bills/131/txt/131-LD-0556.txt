3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to establish a program that allows nonpayment of fees and fines in 
6 certain circumstances. An individual would not pay certain fees and fines upon request if 
7 the Secretary of State determines that the amount of fees or fines creates an excessive 
8 financial hardship on the individual. In making this determination, all relevant factors 
9 would be considered, including but not limited to: the number of the individual's 
10 dependents; the minimum living expenses of the individual and the individual's 
11 dependents; the special needs of the individual and the individual's dependents, including 
12 necessary travel expenses to and from work; the individual's present income and potential 
13 future earning capacity; and the individual's resources, from whatever source.4
