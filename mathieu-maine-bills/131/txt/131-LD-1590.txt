13 covered committee in an election cycle.
14 C. "Election cycle" means the 2-year period beginning the day after a general election 
15 and ending the day of the next general election.
16 D. "Original funds" means an asset over which a covered contributor has legal control 
17 and to which the person holds title that the person received from:
18 (1) Salary, wages or other earned income from employment;
19 (2) Investment income, sale of assets or bequests;
20 (3) Distributions from a partnership, limited liability company or trust in which the

26 E. "Pass-through funds" means funds over which a covered contributor has legal 
27 control and to which the person holds title that are not original funds.
282. Notice to disclose or opt out.  Upon receipt of a contribution from a covered 
29 contributor, a covered committee shall notify the covered contributor in writing that the 
30 funds may be used to make expenditures to influence a campaign in this State and that 
31 information about the sources of pass-through funds may be required and reported under 
32 this section. The notice must provide that the covered contributor has 21 days in which the 
33 covered contributor may state that those funds are original funds; the funds are pass-
34 through funds or the covered contributor opts out of transferring the funds out to influence 
35 a campaign in this State.  If a covered contributor states that the funds include pass-through 
36 funds, the covered contributor shall provide the covered committee with the sources of the 
37 original funds totaling at least as much as the contribution as well as the identity of all 3rd 
38 parties that transferred the original funds from the origin of the funds until the funds were

44 maintain records of this information for at least 5 years and provide the records to the 
45 commission upon request. Any covered contributor that has not confirmed the source of 
46 original funds within 21 days is presumed to have opted out of allowing the contribution to 
47 be used to influence a campaign in this State.  Notice provided pursuant to this subsection 
48 must be on a form prescribed by the commission.  The covered committee shall submit a 
49 copy of the notice sent to the covered contributor to the commission.
93. Restrictions.  A contribution from a covered contributor may be used or transferred 
10 by the covered committee immediately upon the covered committee's receipt of 
11 information required under subsection 2.  A covered committee may not use or transfer 
12 funds received from a covered contributor for the purpose of influencing a campaign in this 
13 State if the covered contributor has opted out or is presumed to have opted out pursuant to 
14 subsection 2.  Funds for which the covered contributor has opted out pursuant to subsection 
15 2 must be segregated from funds in the covered committee's campaign account described 
16 in section 1054.  This subsection may not be construed to prohibit the use or transfer of

20 appropriate report required under section 1017-A or 1059:

26 described in paragraph A; and
27 C.  The identity of all 3rd parties that transferred the original funds from the origin of 
28 the original funds until the funds were received by the covered committee.
29 A covered committee is not responsible for reporting the information required by this 
30 subsection for any funds for which a covered contributor has opted out pursuant to 
31 subsection 2. In making the required reports under this subsection, a covered committee 
32 may rely upon the information it received pursuant to subsection 2, unless the covered 
33 committee knows or has reason to know that the information is false or incomplete.
345. Top 3 funders; original sources.  For a communication made by a covered 
35 committee that is an independent expenditure, as defined in section 1019-B, subsection 1,

6 A.  When determining the amount of any penalty, the commission shall consider the amount 
7 of the original funds not disclosed, the harm suffered by the public from the lack of 
8 disclosure and the covered committee's compliance record.  If the commission determines 
9 that adjusting the statutory maximum penalty amount would serve the purposes of this 
10 section, it may recommend adjustments in a report to the joint standing committee of the 
11 Legislature having jurisdiction over campaign finance reporting matters.
