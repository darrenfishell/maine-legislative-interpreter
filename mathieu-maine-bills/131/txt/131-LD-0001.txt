Page 1 - 131LR0367(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, on March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a nationwide 
4 emergency pursuant to Section 501(b) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
5 Emergency Assistance Act and, on April 4, 2020, the President of the United States 
6 approved a major disaster declaration for the State of Maine for periods beginning on 
7 January 20, 2020 and continuing; and
8Whereas, on March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a national 
9 emergency concerning the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic pursuant to 
10 Sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act and, on February 18, 2022, the 
11 President of the United States continued the national emergency pursuant to Section 202(d) 
12 of the National Emergencies Act; and
13Whereas, on January 31, 2020, the United States Secretary of Health and Human 
14 Services determined that a public health emergency exists and has existed since January 
15 27, 2020 nationwide and, on October 13, 2022, the United States Secretary of Health and 
16 Human Services renewed that determination; and
17Whereas, Maine consumers are experiencing increased energy prices across all fuel 
18 types and experiencing volatility; and
19Whereas, with nearly 60% of homes reliant on heating oil, Maine is the most heating 
20 oil dependent state in the country. Also, the New England electric grid, which supplies 
21 power to a majority of Maine, is over-reliant on natural gas to generate electricity. This 
22 makes Maine distinctly vulnerable to price increases; and
23Whereas, residential energy prices have increased significantly throughout the 
24 pandemic and high winter energy prices will exacerbate the ongoing effects of the 
25 pandemic and pose a threat to Maine's recovery from the pandemic; and
26Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
27 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
28 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
29 therefore,
30Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
