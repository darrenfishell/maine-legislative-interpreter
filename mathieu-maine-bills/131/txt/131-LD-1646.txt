11 B.  A prosecutor receiving a petition pursuant to paragraph A has 14 days from receipt 
12 of the petition to object to the petition and request a hearing pursuant to paragraph D.
13 C.  If a prosecutor fails to object within 14 days of receipt of the petition, the court shall 
14 grant the petition and resentence the individual who is the subject of the petition to the 
15 portion of the sentence the individual has already served.
16 D.  If the prosecutor objects to the petition within 14 days of receipt of the petition, the 
17 court shall schedule a hearing on the petition.  At that hearing, the prosecutor is required 
18 to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that:
19 (1) The crime that is the subject of the petition is not a cannabis-related offense;
20 (2) Resentencing would not be in the interests of justice; or
21 (3) If resentencing is appropriate, the appropriate sentence is something other than 
22 the portion of the sentence the individual who is the subject of the petition has 
23 already served.
24 E. There is a rebuttable presumption that resentencing is in the interests of justice due 
25 to the legalization of the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale, use and possession 
26 of cannabis for adult use pursuant to Title 28-B.  This presumption is rebutted if:
27 (1) Additional, more serious charges unrelated to activities permitted pursuant to 
28 Title 28-B were dismissed as part of a plea deal; or
29 (2) The cannabis-related offense involved distribution of cannabis to a minor or 
30 using a minor to distribute cannabis.
31 F. Unless the prosecutor proves by clear and convincing evidence the requirements of 
32 paragraph D, subparagraph (1) or (2), the court shall resentence the individual as 
33 specified in this paragraph.
34 (1)  Unless the prosecutor proves by clear and convincing evidence that a different 
35 sentence is required pursuant to paragraph D, subparagraph (3), the court shall 
36 sentence the individual to the portion of the sentence the individual has already 
37 served.  
38 (2) If the prosecutor proves by clear and convincing evidence that resentencing to 
39 a sentence other than the portion of the sentence already served is appropriate, the 
40 court shall resentence the individual to the most minimum sentence that is in the 
41 interests of justice.
Page 4 - 131LR1615(01)1 A court may not increase a sentence or impose an additional sentence in response to a 
2 petition.
3 G.  An individual who files a petition that is objected to by a prosecutor is entitled to 
4 court-appointed legal representation at no cost to the individual and without being 
5 required to prove indigency.
6 H.  A fee may not be imposed for the filing of a petition.
74.  Costs to Department of Corrections, county jails, courts and prosecutors.  The 
8 Department of Corrections, the jail administrator, the Administrative Office of the Courts 
9 and the district attorneys for the prosecutorial districts in this State shall annually determine 
10 the costs to the department, the jails, the courts, including the cost of providing legal 
11 representation to individuals filing a petition pursuant to this section, and the district 
12 attorneys, respectively, of complying with this section and shall request payment of those 
13 costs from the State Controller.  Upon receipt of a request for payment, the State Controller 
14 shall reimburse the requesting entity for those costs using funds in the Adult Use Cannabis 
15 Public Health and Safety and Municipal Opt-in Fund established in Title 28-B, section 
16 1101.
17Sec. 2.  28-B MRSA §1101, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
184.  Use of fund for vacating certain sentences, expungement of records and 
19resentencing for crimes and civil violations related to cannabis.  Money credited to the 
20 fund must be used to pay the costs of implementing the vacating of a conviction or 
21 adjudication of a crime or civil violation for possession of cannabis and the expungement 
22 of records of arrest, conviction or adjudication for a crime or civil violation for possession 
23 of cannabis pursuant to Title 15, section 2332 and the costs incurred for determining 
24 individuals eligible for resentencing and implementing the petition and resentencing 
25 process pursuant to Title 15, section 2333.
26SUMMARY
27 This bill provides that all arrests, convictions and adjudications for crimes or civil 
28 violations for possession of cannabis are vacated and requires the records of those arrests, 
29 convictions and adjudications to be expunged in accordance with a process established in 
30 the bill.  This bill also allows for an individual who has been convicted of a cannabis-related 
31 offense and who is still serving a sentence, including incarceration or supervised release, 
32 probation or administrative release, for that crime to petition the original sentencing court 
33 to resentence that individual.  The bill defines "cannabis-related offense" as a conviction 
34 or adjudication for a crime or civil violation involving the sale, use or possession of 
35 cannabis or paraphernalia related to cannabis or that, but for the presence of cannabis, 
36 would not have been a crime or civil violation.
37 Under the bill, the sentencing court must notify the prosecutor who prosecuted the 
38 cannabis-related offense of the petition, who must object to the petition within 14 days or 
39 the court is required to grant the petition and resentence the individual to time served.  If 
40 the prosecutor objects, the prosecutor must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that 
41 the crime for which the individual was sentenced is not a cannabis-related offense, that 
42 resentencing is not in the interests of justice or that if resentencing is appropriate, 
43 resentencing to something other than the portion of the sentence the individual has already 
44 served is appropriate.  The bill establishes a rebuttable presumption that resentencing is in 27
