Page 1 - 131LR1698(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §4612, sub-§2-A, as amended by PL 2021, c. 366, §20, is further 
3 amended by amending the first blocked paragraph to read:
4 An administrative dismissal operates as an order of dismissal and has the same effect as a 
5 finding by the commission that no reasonable grounds exist to believe that unlawful 
6 discrimination has occurred, except that an administrative dismissal does not trigger the 
7 prohibitions in subsection 4, paragraph C and except that an administrative dismissal 
8 pursuant to paragraph C does not entitle the complainant to an award of attorney's fees, 
9 civil penal damages or compensatory and punitive damages.
10Sec. 2.  5 MRSA §4612, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2019, c. 465, §6, is further 
11 amended to read:
124.  Civil action by commission.  The commission may file a civil action only in 
13 accordance with this subsection.
14 A.  If the commission finds reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination 
15 has occurred, and further believes that irreparable injury or great inconvenience will be 
16 caused the victim of such discrimination or to members of a protected class group if 
17 relief is not immediately granted, or if conciliation efforts under subsection 3 have not 
18 succeeded, the commission may file in the Superior Court a civil action seeking such 
19 relief as is appropriate, including temporary restraining orders.  In a complaint 
20 investigated pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the commission and 
21 the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that results in a 
22 reasonable grounds determination, the commission shall file a civil action for the use 
23 of complainant if conciliation efforts under subsection 3 are unsuccessful.
24 B.  Grounds for the filing of such an action before attempting conciliation include, but 
25 are not limited to:
26 (1)  In unlawful housing discrimination, that the housing accommodation sought is 
27 likely to be sold or rented to another during the pendency of proceedings, or that 
28 an unlawful eviction is about to occur;
29 (2)  In unlawful employment discrimination, that the victim of the discrimination 
30 has lost or is threatened with the loss of job and income as a result of such 
31 discrimination;
32 (3)  In unlawful public accommodations discrimination, that such discrimination 
33 is causing inconvenience to many persons; and
34 (4)  In any unlawful discrimination, that the victim of the discrimination is 
35 suffering or is in danger of suffering severe financial loss in relation to 
36 circumstances, severe hardship or personal danger as a result of such 
37 discrimination.
38 C.  If, after investigation, the commission finds that no reasonable grounds exist to 
39 believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred, neither the commission nor 
40 commission staff may:
Page 2 - 131LR1698(01)1 (1)  File a civil action on behalf of the commission or on behalf of the complainant 
2 arising out of the facts and circumstances alleged in the complaint that was 
3 dismissed;
4 (2)  Provide assistance, including legal, financial or administrative assistance, to a 
5 complainant who files a civil action under section 4621 arising out of the facts and 
6 circumstances alleged in the complaint that was dismissed; or
7 (3)  Expend any commission resources to assist a complainant who files a civil 
8 action under section 4621 arising out of the facts and circumstances alleged in the 
9 complaint that was dismissed.
10Sec. 3.  5 MRSA §4614, as amended by PL 2019, c. 465, §7, is further amended to 
11 read:
12§4614.  Attorney's fees and costs
13 In any civil action under this Act, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing 
14 party reasonable attorney's fees and costs, except that the commission may not be awarded 
15 attorney's fees and costs and is not liable to pay any party's attorney's fees and costs unless 
16 the court finds that the commission violated section 4612, subsection 4, paragraph C, in 
17 which case the court shall order the commission to pay the defendant's reasonable attorney's 
18 fees and costs.
19Sec. 4.  Application.  Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 1, section 
20 302, this Act applies to any case that is pending on the effective date of this Act.
21SUMMARY
22 This bill prohibits the Maine Human Rights Commission and commission staff from 
23 filing a civil action arising out of the facts and circumstances alleged in a complaint if the 
24 commission dismissed that complaint based on a finding that no reasonable grounds exist 
25 to believe that unlawful discrimination occurred.  The bill also prohibits the commission 
26 and commission staff from providing assistance, including legal, financial or administrative 
27 assistance, to a complainant who files a civil action arising out of the facts and 
28 circumstances alleged in such a complaint.  If a court finds that the commission or 
29 commission staff have violated these prohibitions, the court is directed to order the 
30 commission to pay the defendant's reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
31 Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 1, section 302, these prohibitions 
32 apply to any case that is pending on the effective date of this legislation.22
