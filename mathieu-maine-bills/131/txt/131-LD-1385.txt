Page 1 - 131LR0461(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §104, first ¶, as amended by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. C, §109 and 
3 affected by PL 2019, c. 417, Pt. B, §14, is further amended to read:
4 An employer who has secured the payment of compensation in conformity with 
5 sections 401 to 407 is exempt from civil actions, either at common law or under sections 
6 901 to 908; Title 14, sections 8101 to 8118; and Title 18‑C, section 2‑807, involving 
7 personal injuries sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of employment, 
8 or for death resulting from those injuries.  An employer that uses a private employment 
9 agency for temporary help services is entitled to the same immunity from civil actions by 
10 employees of the temporary help service as is granted with respect to the employer's own 
11 employees as long as the temporary help service has secured the payment of compensation 
12 in conformity with sections 401 to 407.  "Temporary help services" means a service where 
13 an agency assigns its own employees to a 3rd party to work under the direction and control 
14 of the 3rd party to support or supplement the 3rd party's work force in work situations such 
15 as employee absences, temporary skill shortages, seasonal work load conditions and special 
16 assignments and projects.  These Except as provided in section 104-A, these exemptions 
17 from liability apply to all employees, supervisors, officers and directors of the employer 
18 for any personal injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, or for death 
19 resulting from those injuries.  These exemptions also apply to occupational diseases 
20 sustained by an employee or for death resulting from those diseases.  These exemptions do 
21 not apply to an illegally employed minor as described in section 408, subsection 2.
22Sec. 2.  39-A MRSA §104-A is enacted to read:
23§104-A.  Liability of an employee
24 Notwithstanding section 104, an employee is not exempt from civil actions, either at 
25 common law or under Title 14, sections 8101 to 8118 or Title 18‑C, section 2‑807, if the 
26 employee intentionally or with gross negligence or while committing a criminal act causes 
27 another employee's injury or death for which compensation or medical benefits are payable 
28 under this Act.  The injured employee, or the legal representatives of the employee, may, 
29 at the employee's option, either claim the compensation and benefits payable under this Act 
30 or obtain damages from or proceed at law against the liable employee to recover damages.
31 If the injured employee elects to claim compensation and benefits under this Act, any 
32 employer having paid the compensation or benefits or having become liable for 
33 compensation or benefits under any compensation payment scheme has a lien for the value 
34 of compensation paid on any damages subsequently recovered against the liable employee.  
35 If the injured employee or the employee's beneficiary fails to pursue the remedy against the 
36 liable employee within 30 days after written demand by the employer, the employer is 
37 subrogated to the rights of the injured employee and is entitled to enforce liability in the 
38 employer's own name or in the name of the injured party, the accounting for the proceeds 
39 to be made on the basis provided in this section.
40 If the injured employee or the employee's beneficiary recovers damages from a liable 
41 employee, the injured employee shall repay to the employer, out of the recovery against 
42 the liable employee, the benefits paid by the employer under this Act, less the employer's 
43 proportionate share of cost of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees.
Page 2 - 131LR0461(01)1 If the employer recovers from the liable employee damages in excess of the 
2 compensation and benefits paid or for which the employer has become liable, then any 
3 excess must be paid to the injured employee, less a proportionate share of the expenses and 
4 cost of actions or collection, including reasonable attorney's fees.  Settlement of any such 
5 subrogation claims and the distribution of the proceeds therefrom must be approved by the 
6 court in which the subrogation action is pending or to which it is returnable; or if not in 
7 suit, by the board.  When the court in which the subrogation action is pending or to which 
8 it is returnable is in vacation, the judge of the court or, if the action is pending in or 
9 returnable to the Superior Court, any Justice of the Superior Court may approve the 
10 settlement of the action and the distribution of the proceeds.  The beneficiary is entitled to 
11 reasonable notice and the opportunity to be present in person or by counsel at the approval 
12 proceeding.
13 For purposes of this section, "gross negligence" means willful, wanton and reckless 
14 conduct affecting the life or property of another.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill amends the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992 to provide that an 
17 employee who intentionally or with gross negligence or while committing a criminal act 
18 causes another employee's injury or death is not exempt from civil actions, either at 
19 common law or under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 14, sections 8101 to 8118 or Title 
20 18‑C, section 2‑807.  This bill allows the injured employee, or the legal representative of 
21 that employee, to either claim the compensation and benefits payable under the workers' 
22 compensation laws or obtain damages from or proceed at law against the offending 
23 employee to recover damages.  
24 If the injured employee or the employee's beneficiary recovers damages from an 
25 offending  employee, the injured employee shall repay to the employer, out of the recovery 
26 against the offending employee, the benefits paid by the employer under the workers' 
27 compensation laws, less the employer's proportionate share of cost of collection, including 
28 reasonable attorney's fees.
29 If the injured employee elects to claim compensation and benefits under the workers' 
30 compensation laws, any employer having paid the compensation or benefits or having 
31 become liable for compensation or benefits under any compensation payment scheme has 
32 a lien for the value of compensation paid on any damages subsequently recovered against 
33 the offending employee. If the employee or the employee's beneficiary fails to pursue the 
34 remedy against the offending employee within 30 days after written demand by the 
35 employer, the employer is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee and is entitled 
36 to enforce liability in the employer's own name or in the name of the injured party.
37 If the employer recovers from the offending employee damages in excess of the 
38 compensation and benefits paid or for which the employer has become liable, then any 
39 excess must be paid to the injured employee less a proportionate share of the expenses and 
40 cost of actions or collection, including reasonable attorney's fees.16
