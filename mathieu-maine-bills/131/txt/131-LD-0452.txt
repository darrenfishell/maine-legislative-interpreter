7 modification to avoid a default  or for the termination of the fine.  The convicted person has 
8 the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a default or potential default

10 failure by the person to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment 
11 of the fine.  The court may modify its prior order to allow additional time for payment  or, 
12 to reduce the amount of each installment or to otherwise modify or terminate the fine.

16 time for payment, may reduce the amount of each installment or , may permit the person 
17 to perform community service work at the rate authorized by paragraph A, 
18 subparagraph (2), supervised by the sheriff of the county in which the court that 
19 assessed the fine is located or by a community confinement monitoring agency with 
20 which that sheriff has contracted under Title 30‑A, section 1659‑A or may otherwise 
21 modify or terminate the fine.
22SUMMARY

25 fine and allows the court to modify the fine, including an additional remedy of terminating 
26 the fine. The bill also allows the court to make certain modifications to or terminate a fine 
27 upon a default.23
