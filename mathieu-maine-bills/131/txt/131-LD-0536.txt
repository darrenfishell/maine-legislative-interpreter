14 authority for the body to be subjected to natural organic reduction, and the natural organic 
15 reduction facility in charge of the disposition may not refuse to subject the body to natural 
16 organic reduction solely because these documents are presented by such an authorized 
17 person.  The certificate must be retained by the natural organic reduction facility in charge 
18 of subjecting the body to natural organic reduction for a period of 15 years.  For the 
19 certificate, the medical examiner must receive a fee of $25 payable by the person requesting 
20 the certificate.  This fee may be waived at the discretion of the Chief Medical Examiner.
217. Privacy of human remains.  A natural organic reduction facility shall adopt policies 
22 to ensure that the privacy of human remains is respected.  The facility shall restrict access 
23 to the storage area where human remains are stored or being subjected to natural organic 
24 reduction, except to an authorized person.  For the purposes of this subsection, "authorized 
25 person" means:
26 A. A licensed funeral director;
27 B. A student of the practice of funeral services;
28 C. Officers or trustees of the cemetery corporation operating the natural organic

37 battery, battery pack, power cell, radioactive implant or radioactive device.
389. Container requirements.  Upon delivery to the natural organic reduction facility, 
39 the body of a deceased person must be in a container or wrapped in a manner sufficient to 
40 contain the body and fully decompose through natural organic reduction.  If the container 
41 or wrappings are not able to be naturally organically reduced, the natural organic reduction 
42 facility shall timely notify the person making the funeral arrangements that the body of the 
43 deceased person will be transferred to an alternative container and the person making the 
Page 10 - 131LR0540(01)44 funeral arrangements shall sign an acknowledgement that this timely notification was 
45 made.  This record must be maintained by the natural organic reduction facility.  The body 
46 of the deceased person may then be transferred to an alternative container by a licensed

510. Opening container prohibited; exceptions. The container or wrappings required 
6 in subsection 9 may not be opened or removed unless by a licensed funeral director in the 
7 presence of a witness if good cause exists to confirm the identity of the deceased person, 
8 to ensure that devices identified in subsection 8 are not present or upon reasonable demand 
9 by the person's next of kin or agent.  If the container or wrappings are opened or removed, 
10 the natural organic reduction facility must document in its records the reason, the name of 
11 the person who authorized the opening of the container or removal of the wrappings, the 
12 name of the person who opened the container or removed the wrappings and the name of 
13 the witness.
1411. Multiple deceased persons.  A natural organic reduction facility may not subject 
15 more than one deceased person's body to natural organic reduction in the same container at 
16 one time unless the facility receives explicit, signed authorization by the person making 
17 funeral arrangements.  This record must be maintained by the natural organic reduction 
18 facility.
1912. Treatment of remains after natural organic reduction.  Following the natural 
20 organic reduction of the body of a deceased person, a natural organic reduction facility:
21 A. Shall thoroughly clean the interior of the container used for natural organic 
22 reduction;
23 B. Shall place the remains of the body in an individual container that is sufficient to 
24 hold the remains and does not contain other remains unless authorized pursuant to 
25 subsection 11;
26 C. Shall label the container of the remains of the body with the name of the deceased 
27 person whose body was subjected to natural organic reduction;
28 D. May use a magnet and sieve or other appropriate method to separate the human
