36 of "certified" by the private certification organization.

32 A county or municipality in this State may not regulate the issuance of occupational 
33 licenses or government certifications under this chapter.
34SUMMARY
35 This bill prohibits licensing entities from using good character to evaluate applicants 
36 for licensure and makes a conforming change.  The bill creates a framework for the various 
37 government agencies, boards, departments and other governmental entities that regulate 
38 and issue occupational licenses within the State to offer a path to certification or licensure 
39 in the State to persons who hold occupational credentials from other states in order to allow 35
