40 the laws governing preliminary injunctions in judicial separation and divorce proceedings.1

Page 7 - 131LR0460(01)1 The bill amends the statutes that provide for the mandatory issuance of a preliminary 
2 injunction in judicial separation and divorce proceedings filed in the District Court by:
3 1.  Clarifying the statutory language to help unrepresented individuals understand its 
4 provisions, including by clarifying that the preliminary injunction is an order of the District 
5 Court and by providing greater guidance to the parties about the actions that the parties are 
6 and are not prohibited from engaging in while the preliminary injunction is in effect;
7 2.  Retaining the provision prohibiting each party from disposing of the property of the 
8 parties while the preliminary injunction is in effect, adding additional prohibitions against 
9 damaging or destroying the property of the parties and providing examples of the types of 
10 activities that constitute a violation of this prohibition; 
11 3.  Expanding the provision that prohibits each party from causing the other party or 
12 the parties' children to lose their health insurance coverage while the preliminary injunction 
13 is in effect to include prohibitions against a party causing the loss of dental, disability, 
14 casualty, life and motor vehicle insurance coverage;
15 4.  Newly specifying that each party is prohibited from interfering with mail, e-mail, 
16 text messages and other forms of communication addressed to the other party and that each 
17 party is prohibited from signing the other party's name to a negotiable instrument while the 
18 preliminary injunction is in effect;
19 5.  Clarifying the provision of current law specifying that the preliminary injunction 
20 does not prohibit the parties from encumbering or disposing of property in the usual course 
21 of business or for the necessities of life and further providing that the preliminary injunction 
22 does not prohibit the parties from accessing funds or incurring debt to retain an attorney 
23 for the legal separation or divorce proceeding or to make regular withdrawals in the normal 
24 course of retirement.  In practice, parties typically use marital funds for these purposes and 
25 the commission determined that it would be helpful to clarify within statute that the parties 
26 have a right to do so; and
27 6.  Removing the provision of current law that prohibits the parties from imposing 
28 restraint on the personal liberty of the other party or of a biological or adopted child of 
29 either or both of the parties while the preliminary injunction is in effect because the 
30 commission believes both that this language is unclear and that protections for the personal 
31 liberty of the parties and of the parties' children are more appropriately addressed through 
32 the protection from abuse process.
