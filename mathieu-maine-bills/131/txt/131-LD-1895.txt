34SUMMARY
35 This bill does the following.
36 1. It establishes the Maine Offshore Wind Renewable Energy and Economic 
37 Development Program within the Public Utilities Commission to further the development 
38 and use of offshore wind energy resources in the Gulf of Maine. Under the program the 
39 commission is directed to: 35
Page 11 - 131LR0741(01)1 A. Encourage the development of extraterritorial wind power projects in the Gulf of 
2 Maine that are responsibly sited and advance the renewable energy and climate policies 
3 and economic development goals of the State;
4 B. Establish standards for local hiring, workforce development and safety and promote 
5 diversity, equity and inclusion;
6 C. Monitor impacts of offshore wind power projects on the marine environment; and
7 D. Develop the transmission infrastructure necessary for the State to expeditiously 
8 meet its renewable energy and climate goals using offshore wind power projects 
9 located in the Gulf of Maine. 
10 2. It directs the commission to conduct a series of competitive solicitations in order to 
11 select floating extraterritorial wind projects for contracts with transmission and distribution 
12 utilities.  
13 A. The first competitive solicitation must occur no later than June 1, 2025.
14 B. Each subsequent solicitation must occur within 24 months of a previous solicitation.
15 C. Each solicitation must seek proposals for not less than 600 megawatts of aggregate 
16 nameplate capacity of floating extraterritorial wind projects.
17 D. The procurement must result in contracts for projects totaling at least:   
18 (1) One thousand megawatts of aggregate nameplate capacity, no later than 
19 February 1, 2030; and
20 (2) Two thousand, eight-hundred megawatts of aggregate nameplate capacity, no 
21 later than February 1, 2035.
22 E. In conducting a solicitation and selecting floating extraterritorial wind projects for 
23 contracts, the commission is required to attach specific weight to benefits to ratepayers, 
24 benefits to the State's economy and benefits for natural resources.
25 F. Proposals must include mitigation plans for impacts on wildlife, fisheries and the 
26 marine environment;  a diversity, equity and inclusion plan; a project labor agreement; 
27 a preconstruction stakeholder engagement plan; a plan for consultation with federally 
28 recognized Indian tribes who may be affected; payment of an amount per megawatt of 
29 capacity to the Renewable Ocean Energy Trust established within the Department of 
30 Marine Resources; and payment of an amount per megawatt of capacity to the newly 
31 created Justice Fund.  
32 3. It provides that an application for a submerged lands lease or easement in connection 
33 with an offshore wind power project selected for a contract must be charged an annual 
34 operating fee based on the electricity generated using a certain federal formula. It also 
35 requires the applicant to demonstrate that it has fully executed or will execute a labor peace 
36 agreement with a bona fide labor organization that actively represents or seeks to represent 
37 employees working for and providing services in connection with the offshore wind power 
38 project. 
39 4. It provides that when the Shore and Harbor Management Fund expends money for 
40 the purpose of constructing improvements in connection with an offshore wind power 
41 project selected for a contract, the grant of any such funds must be conditioned upon the 
42 recipient's agreement to conform to the requirements applicable to assisted projects under 
Page 12 - 131LR0741(01)43 Title 26, chapter 15.  It also amends Title 26, chapter 15 to clarify that such projects are 
44 considered assisted projects for purposes of that chapter.
3 5. It authorizes the commission to enter into contracts for transmission service to serve 
4 offshore wind power projects; the commission must conduct a competitive solicitation 
5 procurement process in order to select entities to provide the transmission service.1
