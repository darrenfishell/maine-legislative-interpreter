Page 1 - 131LR2461(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, an existing public safety answering point has indicated that as of July 1, 
4 2023, it will no longer provide E-9-1-1 call answering to municipalities in Kennebec 
5 County; and 
6Whereas, it is not sufficiently clear that the Public Utilities Commission has authority 
7 to create a new public safety answering point; and
8Whereas, it may be necessary to create as soon as possible a new public safety 
9 answering point in order to ensure all people in the State have efficient and reliable access 
10 to E-9-1-1 services; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  25 MRSA §2923-B is enacted to read:
17§2923-B.  Notice of service discontinuation
181. Notice. A public safety answering point shall provide the bureau with notice at least 
19 one year prior to discontinuing service to a municipality, unless the bureau authorizes a 
20 shorter period of time for notification. If appropriate, the bureau shall notify the department 
21 of the notice of discontinuing service received by the bureau from a public safety answering 
22 point. 
232. Penalty. A violation of subsection 1 is a civil violation for which a fine of up to 
24 $500 may be adjudged.
25Sec. 2.  25 MRSA §2926, sub-§2-B is enacted to read:
262-B.  Exceptions.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the bureau 
27 may authorize the establishment of a public safety answering point on a determination that 
28 a public safety answering point is necessary to ensure public safety and access to E-9-1-1 
29 services.
30Sec. 3. Study; oversight of public safety answering points.  The Public Utilities 
31 Commission, Emergency Services Communication Bureau shall conduct a study assessing 
32 whether public safety answering points can be more efficiently managed to ensure stability 
33 of the system. The study must include but is not limited to the following:
34 1. The use of incentives or subsidies provided from the E-9-1-1 surcharge set out in the 
35 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 25, section 2927 that are tied to performance metrics for 
36 public safety answering point services in order to stabilize the relationships between public 
37 safety answering points and municipalities;
38 2. The current level of state oversight of public safety answering points and whether 
39 this level is sufficient to ensure the efficient management of public safety answering points;
Page 2 - 131LR2461(01)1 3. The effectiveness of making the Department of Public Safety the default entity 
2 responsible for providing E-9-1-1 services when there is a change in a public safety 
3 answering point’s service area; and
4 4. The challenges faced by public safety answering points with hiring and retaining 
5 employees and what methods could be employed to assist public safety answering points 
6 with staffing obstacles.
7 No later than February 1, 2024, the Public Utilities Commission shall report the results 
8 of the study, along with any recommended legislation, to the joint standing committee of 
9 the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy, utilities and technology matters. The joint 
10 standing committee may report out related legislation to the 131st Legislature in 2024.

12 takes effect when approved.
