Page 1 - 131LR0852(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, one in 4 children in Maine are at risk of hunger; and
4Whereas, recent amendments to the school food service program laws do not 
5 specifically address the provision of milk to a student who does not receive a lunch through 
6 a program; and
7Whereas, schools have interpreted the amendments to those laws as not including the 
8 provision of free milk to such students; and
9Whereas, some schools have accordingly begun providing free milk to all students 
10 out of their own budgets while others require these students to purchase milk; and
11Whereas, the immediate resolution of this statutory ambiguity is necessary to ensure 
12 equal treatment of students within Maine schools; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore,
17Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §6602, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:
191-A.  Milk.  A public school that participates in the National School Lunch Program 
20 must provide free milk to a student during the student’s lunch regardless of whether that 
21 student receives a lunch through that program.  The State shall provide to the public school 
22 funding equal to the cost of milk for students who do not receive a meal through the 
23 National School Lunch Program.
24Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §6662, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2011, c. 224, §1, is further 
25 amended to read:
262.  Food and beverages outside school lunch programs.  The department shall adopt 
27 rules to establish standards for food and beverages sold or distributed on school grounds 
28 but outside of school meal programs.  These standards must include maximum portion 
29 sizes, except for portion sizes for milk, that are consistent with federal school nutrition 
30 standards.  The rules and standards must also require schools that participate in a school 
31 lunch program to provide free milk to a student, regardless of whether the student receives 
32 a lunch through the program or brings a lunch.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection 
33 are major substantive rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
34 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection do not apply to food and beverages sold or 
35 offered at community events or fund-raisers held outside the hours of the normal school 
36 day and to products prepared in culinary arts programs provided by career and technical 
37 schools and programs.
38Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
39 takes effect when approved.

2 This bill changes the school food service program laws to require participating public 
3 schools to provide free milk to all students, regardless of whether they receive a lunch 
4 through the program or bring their own lunch.  The bill also requires the Department of

6 to reflect the requirement for free milk.2
