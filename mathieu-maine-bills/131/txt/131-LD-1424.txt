13 Under current law, an employee of the Department of Corrections or the Department

15 and whose duties involve contact with prisoners, probationers, parolees or juvenile 
16 offenders or supervising such an employee qualifies for the 1998 Special Plan and may 
17 receive a service retirement benefit after completing 25 years of service.

21 the 1998 Special Plan and may receive a service retirement benefit after completing at least 
22 25 years of service.13
