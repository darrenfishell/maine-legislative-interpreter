17SUMMARY
18 This bill is submitted by the Family Law Advisory Commission pursuant to the Maine 
19 Revised Statutes, Title 19-A, section 354, subsection 2.
20 The bill makes several changes to Title 4, section 152, subsection 5-A, which governs 
21 the jurisdiction of the District Court. The bill clarifies the respective jurisdictions of the 
22 District Court and the probate courts of the State of actions brought under Title 18-C, the 
23 Maine Uniform Probate Code, concerning minors. The bill adds proceedings pursuant to 
24 the Maine Juvenile Code brought against a minor child to the list of pending District Court 
25 actions involving a minor child that will give the District Court exclusive, continuing 
26 jurisdiction over Title 18-C actions involving that child and it removes actions for 
27 protection from abuse and harassment from that list. The bill also provides that the District 
28 Court has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over current and future Title 18-C actions 
29 involving the child if the child has been the subject of an order terminating parental rights, 
30 appointing a guardian including a permanency, emergency or interim guardian, awarding 
31 parental rights to a 3rd party or granting an adoption. The bill clarifies when a proceeding 
32 is pending.
33 The bill also establishes an exception to the grant of exclusive, continuing jurisdiction 
34 to the District Court if the action that would otherwise provide the grounds for the District 
35 Court's jurisdiction is initiated when the action is under advisement with the Probate Court 
36 after a testimonial hearing unless the Probate Court determines that the District Court is the 
37 more appropriate forum for the action.
38 The bill includes changes to Title 4, section 251-A, which governs the jurisdiction of 
39 the probate courts of the State, consistent with changes to Title 4, section 152.18
