8 amended to read:
9 A-1.  "Closing" means the permanent shutdown of industrial or commercial operations 
10 at a covered establishment.  A closing may occur due to relocation, termination or 
11 consolidation of the employer's business.
12Sec. 3.  26 MRSA §625-B, sub-§1, ¶F, as enacted by PL 1979, c. 663, §157, is

17Sec. 4.  26 MRSA §625-B, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2015, c. 417, §1, is further 
18 amended to read:
193.  Mitigation of severance pay liability.  There is no liability under this section for

21 A.  Closing of or a mass layoff at a covered establishment is necessitated by a physical 
22 calamity or the final order of a federal, state or local government agency; or
23 B.  The employee is covered by, and has actually been paid under the terms of, an 
24 express contract providing for severance pay that is in an amount that is greater than 
25 the severance pay required by this section.  An employer must demonstrate, to the 
26 satisfaction of the director, that the severance pay provided under the terms of an 
27 express contract provides a greater benefit to the employee than provided in this 
28 section; or .
29 D.  The employee has been employed by the employer for less than 3 years.
30SUMMARY
31 Current law regarding employee severance pay due to the closing, substantial shutdown 
32 or relocation of a covered establishment applies only to industrial and commercial facilities.  
33 This bill removes that limitation, making the law applicable to sectors that are not within 
34 the industrial or commercial category.  It also removes the exclusion from eligibility for 
35 severance pay of employees who have not been employed by the employer for at least 3 
36 years.31
