Page 1 - 131LR0567(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง6681, sub-ยง6 is enacted to read:
36.  Lunch period of at least 30 minutes; unconsumed food.  A school administrative 
4 unit shall provide a lunch period of at least 30 minutes to every student under the 
5 jurisdiction of the school administrative unit unless the governing body of the school 
6 administrative unit determines by vote after notice and public hearing that a lunch period 
7 of at least 30 minutes would be impracticable. A lunch period under this subsection may 
8 not include recess, which must be allocated adequate time separate from the lunch period 
9 and, to the extent possible, be scheduled immediately before the lunch period. To the extent 
10 possible, the school administrative unit shall provide a table, container or other area where 
11 a student may return unconsumed whole food or beverage items that may be provided to 
12 another student pursuant to guidelines issued by the United States Department of 
13 Agriculture.
14SUMMARY
15 This bill requires school administrative units to provide students with a lunch period of 
16 at least 30 minutes unless determined impracticable by the school administrative unit's 
17 governing body after notice and public hearing. The lunch period must be separate from 
18 recess, which the school administrative unit is encouraged to provide directly before the 
19 lunch break. This bill also requires to the extent possible for the school administrative unit 
20 to provide a table, container or other area where a student may return unconsumed whole 
21 food or beverage items that may be provided to other students.15
