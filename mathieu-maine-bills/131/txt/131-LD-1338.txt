3 repealed and the following enacted in its place:

13 additional exclusion amount allowed under section 4120.
14Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §4119, as amended by PL 2019, c. 607, Pt. D, §5, is further 
15 amended to read:
16§4119.  Annual adjustments for inflation
17 Beginning in 2018 and each year thereafter  ending in 2021, annually, on or about 
18 September 15th, for the estates of decedents who die during the succeeding calendar year, 
19 the assessor shall multiply the cost-of-living adjustment by the dollar amount contained in 
20 section 4102, subsection 5, paragraph C applicable to estates of decedents dying  on or after 
21 January 1, 2018  before January 1, 2024.  Beginning in 2025 and each year thereafter, on or 
22 about September 15th, for the estates of decedents who die during the succeeding calendar
