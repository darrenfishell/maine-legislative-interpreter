22SUMMARY
23 This bill amends the Cannabis Legalization Act.  It defines "cartoon" and "matrix," 
24 removes the prohibition against a label or packaging that depicts a human, animal or fruit 
25 and adds a prohibition against a label or packaging that includes a cartoon.  It removes the 
26 0.6 to 5 milligram limitation on the allowable variance rate of 10% on the amount or 
27 potency of cannabinoids for a serving or package of edible cannabis products. It also 
28 amends testing requirements to account for matrices, including adding specific testing 
29 requirements for cannabis flower, cannabis trim, cannabis concentrate and cannabis 
30 products. It also provides for audit testing and amends the provisions regarding notification 
31 of testing results to address retesting and remediation.23
