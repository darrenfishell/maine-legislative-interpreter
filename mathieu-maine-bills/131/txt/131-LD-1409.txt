17 training costs, the 2nd municipality shall reimburse the first municipality according to the 
18 following formula, unless a mutual agreement is reached.
19 A.  If the first responder is hired by the 2nd municipality during the first year after the

36 obligated to reimburse the first municipality.
37 If the first responder is subsequently hired by additional municipalities within 5 years of 
38 the first municipality's initial incurrence of any training costs, each of those governmental 
39 entities is liable to the municipality immediately preceding it for the training costs paid by 
40 that municipality under this subsection.  The extent of financial liability must be determined 
41 according to the formula established in this subsection.
