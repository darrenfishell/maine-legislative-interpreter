19SUMMARY
20 This bill is proposed by the Family Law Advisory Commission pursuant to the Maine 
21 Revised Statutes, Title 19-A, section 354, subsection 2.  It amends 2 provisions of the 
22 Maine Parentage Act.
23 The bill clarifies within Title 19-A, section 1836 that a child is not required to be joined 
24 as a party in a proceeding to determine that child’s parentage.
25 Under Title 19-A, section 1844, if a court in a proceeding to dissolve a marriage acts 
26 under the jurisdictional requirements of Maine law and the final order identifies a child as 
27 a "child of the marriage" or "issue of the marriage" or by similar words indicates that the 
28 parties are the parents of the child, the court is deemed to have made an adjudication of that 
29 child's parentage and that adjudication is binding on the parties to the proceeding.  The bill 
30 clarifies that section 1844 applies not only to divorce proceedings but also to proceedings 
31 to annul a marriage or for legal separation.  It also expands the scope of section 1844 to 
32 apply to proceedings to determine the parental rights and responsibilities with respect to a 
33 child's unmarried parents.  20
