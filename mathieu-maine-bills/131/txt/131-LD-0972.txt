Page 1 - 131LR2430(01)1Whereas, the number of brands of beverages in returnable containers required to be 
2 individually sorted by redemption centers has increased exponentially since redemption 
3 centers were first authorized, increasing the labor necessary for handling beverage 
4 containers; and
5Whereas, labor, rent, utilities and other operating costs for redemption centers, 
6 pick-up agents and other stakeholders have increased significantly; and
7Whereas, new technological advances and diverse systems of cost and responsibility 
8 distribution between stakeholders have been successfully deployed in other states and 
9 countries that authorize bottle redemption and some of these systems will provide 
10 efficiencies if adapted to the State; and
11Whereas, the redemption rate for beverage containers in Maine ranges from 67% to 
12 85% depending on the type of container and the initiator of deposit; and
13Whereas, the redemption centers have been successful in removing the blight of litter 
14 from Maineâ€™s landscape and providing a system for collection of these materials for 
15 recycling; now, therefore, be it
16Sec. 1. Department of Environment Protection to review returnable 
17beverage container laws. Resolved: That the Department of Environmental Protection 
18 shall consult with stakeholders and provide recommendations for any necessary changes to 
19 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, chapter 33 to maximize recycling of returnable 
20 beverage containers, ensure convenience and equity and reduce costs for collection and 
21 handling. The department shall include any recommendations in the report required by the 
22 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 1772 to the Joint Standing Committee on 
23 Environment and Natural Resources by February 15, 2024. The committee may report out 
24 legislation to the Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature relating to the 
25 department's recommendations.
