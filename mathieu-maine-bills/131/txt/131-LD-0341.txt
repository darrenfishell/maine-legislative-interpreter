3 amended to read:
43.  Penalty.  If Except as provided in subsection 3-A, if land is withdrawn from taxation 
5 under this subchapter, the assessor shall impose a penalty upon the owner. The penalty is 
6 the greater of:
7 A.  An amount equal to the taxes that would have been assessed on the land on the first 
8 day of April for the 5 tax years, or any lesser number of tax years starting with the year 
9 in which the land was first classified, preceding the withdrawal had that land been 
10 assessed in each of those years at its just value on the date of withdrawal less all taxes 
11 paid on that land over the preceding 5 years, or any lesser number of tax years starting 
12 with the year in which the land was first classified, and increased by interest at the 
13 prevailing municipal rate from the date or dates on which those amounts would have 
14 been payable; and
15 B.  An amount computed by multiplying the amount, if any, by which the just value of 
16 the land on the date of withdrawal exceeds the 100% valuation of the land pursuant to 
17 this subchapter on the preceding April 1st by the following rates.
18 (1)  If the land was subject to valuation under this subchapter for 10 years or fewer 
19 prior to the date of withdrawal, the rate is 30%.
20 (2)  If the land was subject to valuation under this subchapter for more than 10 
21 years prior to the date of withdrawal, the rate is 30% reduced by one percentage 
22 point for each full year beyond 10 years that the land was subject to valuation under 
23 this subchapter prior to the date of withdrawal, except that the minimum rate is 
24 20%.
25 For purposes of this subsection and subsection 3-A, just value at the time of withdrawal is 
26 the assessed just value of comparable property in the municipality adjusted by the 
27 municipality's certified assessment ratio.
28Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §581, sub-§3-A is enacted to read:
293-A.  Penalty; use of land for single-family housing construction.  If land is 
30 withdrawn from taxation under this subchapter and a portion of the land will be used for 
31 construction of single-family residential housing and the conditions required for building 
32 construction are met within 2 years of withdrawal, the assessor shall impose a penalty upon 
33 the owner that is the lesser of the amounts calculated under subsection 3, paragraphs A and 
34 B.  If single-family residential housing on the land is not completed within 2 years of 
35 withdrawal or the conditions required for building construction are not met, the penalty 
36 must be calculated under subsection 3 and a supplemental penalty may be assessed.
37SUMMARY
