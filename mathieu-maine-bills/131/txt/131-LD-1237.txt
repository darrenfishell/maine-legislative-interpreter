2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §4015 is enacted to read:
3§4015.  Minimum hourly wage for school support staff
41. Definition.  For the purposes of this section, "school support staff" means a public 
5 school employee who is not an administrator, as defined in section 13001-A, subsection 1, 
6 and is not a certified teacher or career and technical education teacher subject to the 
7 minimum salary requirement pursuant to section 13407. 
82. Minimum hourly wage.  For the school year starting after June 30, 2024, and for 
9 each subsequent school year, the minimum hourly wage for school support staff is as 
10 follows:
11 A. For the school year starting after June 30, 2024, the minimum hourly wage is $17 
12 per hour;
13 B. For the school year starting after June 30, 2025, the minimum hourly wage is $18 
14 per hour;
15 C. For the school year starting after June 30, 2026, the minimum hourly wage is $19 
16 per hour; 
17 D. For the school year starting after June 30, 2027, the minimum hourly wage is $20 
18 per hour; and
19 E. For the school year starting after June 30, 2028, and for each subsequent school year, 
20 the minimum hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in 
21 the cost of living.
223.  Cost-of-living increases.  The increase in the cost of living must be measured by 
23 the percentage increase, if any, as of August of the previous year over the level as of August 
24 of the year preceding that year in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and 
25 Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by 
26 the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, 
27 with the amount of the minimum hourly wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 
28 5¢. If the highest federal minimum hourly wage is increased in excess of the minimum 
29 hourly wage in effect under this section, the minimum hourly wage under this section is 
30 increased to the same amount, effective on the same date as the increase in the federal 
31 minimum hourly wage, and must be increased in accordance with this section thereafter.
32Sec. 2.  State contribution.  Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
33 20-A, chapter 606-B, for the school years starting after June 30, 2024, June 30, 2025 and 
34 June 30, 2026 only, the State shall provide 50% of the additional funding necessary to 
35 achieve the minimum hourly wage for school support staff established under Title 20-A, 
36 section 4015. The Department of Education shall determine the additional funding 
37 necessary to achieve the minimum hourly wage for school support staff for each school 
38 administrative unit through the collection of data from school administrative units. A 
39 school administrative unit shall provide to the department on or before October 1, 2023 the 
40 current wage per hour paid to school support staff eligible for the minimum hourly wage 
41 in Title 20-A, section 4015.
