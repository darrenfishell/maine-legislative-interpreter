7 students in science, technology, engineering and math and that:
8 A.  Maintains a formal affiliation with a national program to provide opportunities for 
9 students to present Maine-based research to a national audience and facilitates 
10 participation in the national program by students who meet qualification standards, at 
11 no cost to the students;
12 B. Demonstrates a plan to broaden participation in student-led experiential science and 
13 engineering projects by creating professional development opportunities for educators 
14 and learning opportunities for students who have not historically participated in 
15 student-led experiential science and engineering projects;

17 school students increased access to college-level courses and consideration for

25 section shall:
26 A. Provide matching funds in the amount of the grant to be used for the same purpose
