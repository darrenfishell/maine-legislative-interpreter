2Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §1518-B is enacted to read:
3§1518-B.  Maine Residents Income Tax Relief Fund
41.  Maine Residents Income Tax Relief Fund established; purpose.  The Maine 
5 Residents Income Tax Relief Fund, referred to in this section as "the fund," is established 
6 to provide relief from income taxes imposed on residents of this State, as described in this 
7 subsection.
8 A.  Beginning in fiscal year 2024-25, all resources appropriated to the fund must be 
9 used to increase the personal exemption amount authorized pursuant to Title 36, section 
10 5126-A.  The State Tax Assessor shall annually determine the amount of the increase 
11 rounded down to the nearest $50 and as limited by paragraph B.  If any increase is 
12 made, it is effective for the current taxable year and must be incorporated into the 
13 income tax forms and instructions of the State Tax Assessor for that taxable year.  Any 
14 increase pursuant to this section must be determined before the adjustments authorized 
15 in Title 36, section 5403, subsections 7 and 8.
16 B.  The adjustment required pursuant to paragraph A may not be made if it would result 
17 in a personal exemption amount higher than that allowed for federal tax purposes.
18 C.  If the amount of an increase in the personal exemption pursuant to paragraph A 
19 would result in a personal exemption amount higher than that allowed for federal tax 
20 purposes, the State Tax Assessor shall report that fact to the joint standing committee 
21 of the Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation matters.  The joint standing 
22 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation matters may report out 
23 legislation that provides a method different than that specified in paragraph A of 
24 providing tax relief to residents of the State using the resources transferred to the fund.
252.  Transfers to the Maine Residents Income Tax Relief Fund.  Notwithstanding 
26 any provision of law to the contrary, the State Controller shall transfer to the Maine 
27 Residents Income Tax Relief Fund all revenue generated by the seasonal sales tax imposed 
28 pursuant to Title 36, section 1811, subsection 3.
293.  Nonlapsing fund.  Any unexpended balance in the Maine Residents Income Tax 
30 Relief Fund may not lapse, but must be carried forward to be used pursuant to subsection 
31 1.
32Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §1811, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
333.  Seasonal sales tax.  Beginning in 2024, in addition to the 5.5% tax imposed 
34 pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph D, for sales occurring during the period starting with 
35 the last Monday in May until the 2nd Monday in October, an additional tax at the rate of 
36 2% is imposed on the value of all tangible personal property and taxable services.  The tax 
37 imposed pursuant to this subsection applies only to those sales of personal property and 
38 services subject to the 5.5% tax.
39 Notwithstanding Title 30-A, section 5681 or any other provision of law to the contrary, all 
40 revenue from the tax imposed pursuant to this subsection must be deposited in the Maine 
41 Residents Income Tax Relief Fund established in Title 5, section 1518-B to be used for the 
42 purposes stated in Title 5, section 1518-B, subsection 1.

12SUMMARY
13 This bill makes the following changes to the laws regarding the sales tax.
14 1.  It enacts an additional seasonal sales tax of 2%, imposed annually between 
15 Memorial Day and Indigenous Peoples Day beginning in 2024.  The tax is imposed only 
16 on those items or services that are subject to the current 5.5% sales tax.
17 2.  Revenue from the seasonal sales tax is deposited, without any subtractions, into the 
18 new Maine Residents Income Tax Relief Fund.  The purpose of the fund is to reduce Maine 
19 residents' income taxes by increasing the amount of the personal exemption.  The State Tax 
20 Assessor is required to annually determine whether there are sufficient funds in the fund to 
21 increase the personal exemption by $50 increments and if there are, then make that change 
22 for the tax year in which that determination of sufficiency is made.  If the change would 
23 increase the personal exemption beyond the amount allowed under federal law, then the 
24 joint standing committee having jurisdiction over taxation matters may report out 
25 legislation that uses the funds to reduce the income tax by other means.
26 3.  It amends the refundable sales tax fairness credit to increase the maximum credit to 
27 $300 and increase the income levels at which the credit is phased out, beginning in 2024.13
