2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §533-A, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 646, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 A.  Between July 1st and October 31st, the Secretary of State shall disburse to a 
5 participating municipality a sum equal to the difference in the amount of excise tax that 
6 would have been collected by that municipality in the prior fiscal year on each 
7 commercial motor vehicle or bus under Title 36, section 1482, subsection 1, paragraph 
8 C, subparagraph (3) or (4) using the manufacturer's suggested retail price from the 
9 amount of that excise tax actually collected by that municipality in the prior fiscal year 
10 based on the actual purchase price.  The Secretary of State shall provide supporting 
11 documentation to a municipality regarding the disbursement that municipality receives 
12 under this section.
13Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §1482, sub-§1, ¶C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 263, §1, is further 
14 amended to read:
15 C.  For the privilege of operating a motor vehicle, including a commercial motor 
16 vehicle as defined in Title 29-A, section 101, subsection 17, paragraphs A and B and 
17 special mobile equipment as defined in Title 29-A, section 101, subsection 70, or 
18 camper trailer on the public ways, each motor vehicle, other than a stock race car, or 
19 each camper trailer to be so operated is subject to excise tax as follows, except as 
20 specified in subparagraph (3), (4) or (5):  a sum equal to 24 mills on each dollar of the 
21 maker's list purchase price for the first or current year of model, 17 1/2 mills for the 
22 2nd year, 13 1/2 mills for the 3rd year, 10 mills for the 4th year, 6 1/2 mills for the 5th 
23 year and 4 mills for the 6th and succeeding years.  The minimum tax is $5 for a motor 
24 vehicle other than a bicycle with motor attached, $2.50 for a bicycle with motor 
25 attached, $15 for a camper trailer other than a tent trailer and $5 for a tent trailer.  The 
26 excise tax on a stock race car is $5.
27 (1)  On new registrations of automobiles, trucks and truck tractors, the excise tax 
28 payment must be made prior to registration and is for a one-year period from the 
29 date of registration.
30 (2)  Vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan are subject to an 
31 excise tax determined on a monthly proration basis if their registration period is 
32 less than 12 months.
33 (3)  For commercial vehicles manufactured in model year 1996 and after, the 
34 amount of excise tax due for trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 26,000 
35 pounds and for Class A special mobile equipment, as defined in Title 29-A, section 
36 101, subsection 70, is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather 
37 than on the list price.  Verification of purchase price for the application of excise 
38 tax is determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided 
39 at point of purchase.  The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial 
40 purchaser of a new vehicle.
41  ( 4)  For buses manufactured in model year 2006 and after, the amount of excise 
42 tax due is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather than on the 
43 list price.  Verification of purchase price for the application of excise tax is 
44 determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided at 
Page 2 - 131LR0697(01)45 point of purchase.  The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial 
46 purchaser of a new vehicle.
3 ( 5)  For trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 26,000 pounds that have 
4 been reconstructed using a prepackaged kit that may include a frame, front axle or 
5 body but does not include a power train or engine and for which a new certificate 
6 of title is required to be issued, the amount of excise tax due is based on the maker's 
7 list price of the prepackaged kit.
8 For motor vehicles being registered pursuant to Title 29-A, section 405, subsection 1, 
9 paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the 
10 registration.
11Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §1482, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2013, c. 263, §2, is further 
12 amended to read:
134.  Maker's list price.  The maker's list price of a vehicle to be used must be obtained 
14 from sources approved by the State Tax Assessor, except for a truck or truck tractor 
15 described under subsection 1, paragraph C, subparagraph (5).  When the maker's list price 
16 of a vehicle is not readily obtainable the State Tax Assessor shall prescribe the maker's list 
17 price to be used or the manner in which the maker's list price is determined.
18 A.  At the time of payment of the excise tax prior to a new registration for a new 
19 passenger vehicle purchased from a motor vehicle dealer licensed in any state for the 
20 sale of new passenger vehicles, the owner shall submit the manufacturer's suggested 
21 retail price sticker, or a copy of the sticker, to the excise tax collector.  In the case of 
22 rental and fleet vehicles, other documentation may be provided at the discretion of the 
23 municipal excise tax collector.
24 This paragraph applies only to those vehicles for which a manufacturer's suggested 
25 retail price sticker is required by the Federal Government.
26SUMMARY
27 This bill changes the method of computing the excise tax that is levied on motor 
28 vehicles, special mobile equipment and camper trailers registered in the State.
29 With the exception of certain commercial motor vehicles, buses and special mobile 
30 equipment, current law requires that the excise tax be based upon the maker's list price for 
31 the motor vehicle; the excise tax on certain commercial motor vehicles, buses and special 
32 mobile equipment is based on the purchase price. This bill requires that the excise tax for 
33 all motor vehicles, special mobile equipment and camper trailers be based upon the 
34 purchase price of the vehicle, equipment or trailer.  Either the original bill of sale or the 
35 state sales tax document may be used to verify the purchase price.
36 Current law also requires the State to reimburse a municipality for the difference in the 
37 amount of excise tax that would have been collected by the municipality on each 
38 commercial motor vehicle or bus using the manufacturer's suggested retail price instead of 
39 the actual purchase price. This bill applies that requirement to all vehicles registered and 
40 taxed by the municipality using the actual purchase price.1
