2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3210-G, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2021, c. 705, §14, is 
3 further amended to read:
41.  Competitive procurement.  The commission shall conduct 2 competitive 
5 solicitations in order to select Class IA resources for contracts under this section  subsection.
6 A.  Through the competitive solicitations under this  section  subsection, the commission 
7 shall procure an amount of energy or renewable energy credits from Class IA resources 
8 that is equal to 14% of the retail electricity sales in this State for the period from January 
9 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, as determined by the commission.
10 (1)  The commission shall initiate a first competitive solicitation and ensure that 
11 the solicitation results in the approval of contracts by December 31, 2020 for 
12 energy or renewable energy credits equal to at least 7% of retail electricity sales 
13 for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, as determined by the 
14 commission. If the commission determines that contracts for an amount greater 
15 than 7% of retail electricity sales will provide financial benefits to ratepayers, it 
16 may approve contracts by December 31, 2020 for up to 10% of retail electricity 
17 sales.
18 (2)  No later than January 15, 2021, the commission shall initiate a 2nd competitive 
19 solicitation for an amount of energy or renewable energy credits equal to the 
20 difference between 14% of retail electricity sales and the amount approved in 
21 contracts by December 31, 2020.
22 B.  To the extent sufficient resources are available, 75% of the energy or renewable 
23 energy credits contracted under this section  subsection must come from Class IA 
24 resources that begin commercial operations after June 30, 2019 and 25% must come 
25 from Class IA resources that began commercial operations on or prior to June 30, 2019.
26 C.  In conducting a solicitation and selecting Class IA resources for contracts under 
27 this section  subsection, the commission shall weigh the benefits to ratepayers and the 
28 benefits to the State's economy as follows:
29 (1)  A weight of 70% must be given to the benefits to ratepayers; and
30 (2)  A weight of 30% must be given to benefits to the economy, which may include, 
31 but are not limited to:
32 (a)  Capital investments by the Class IA resource to improve long-term 
33 viability of an existing facility;
34 (b)  Payments by the Class IA resource for the harvest of wood fuel;

38 (e)  Excise, income, property and sales taxes paid by the Class IA resource;
39 (f)  Purchases of goods and services by the Class IA resource;
40 (g)  Avoided emissions resulting from the operation of the Class IA resource; 
41 and
Page 2 - 131LR1019(01)1 (h)  With respect to requests for bids or proposals for assisted projects, as 
2 defined in Title 26, section 1304, subsection 1‑A:
3 (i)  Whether the Class IA resource has entered into a project labor 
4 agreement with a labor organization to supply construction workers in all 
5 crafts needed for the assisted project where the assisted project is located. 
6 For purposes of this subdivision, a project labor agreement must conform 
7 to the requirements of section 3210‑H, subsection 2; and
8 (ii)  Whether an entity is employee-owned, including but not limited to an 
9 entity that offers employee stock ownership plans or is structured as a 
10 worker cooperative.
11 D.  The commission shall, in accordance with this paragraph, allow energy storage 
12 systems to participate in solicitations or be awarded contracts under this section  
13 subsection.
14 (1)  The commission shall permit an energy storage system to bid on solicitations 
15 or to be contracted under this section  subsection only if the energy storage system 
16 is connected to the State's electricity grid, paired as a complementary resource with 
17 a Class IA resource and either:
18 (a)  Colocated with the Class IA resource, whether metered jointly with or 
19 separately from the Class IA resource; or
20 (b)  Located at a different location from the Class IA resource and the 
21 commission finds that inclusion of the energy storage system would result in a 
22 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
23 (2)  A bid under this section  subsection that includes an energy storage system must 
24 include 2 separate bid proposals, one with the energy storage system and one 
25 without.   The commission shall assess the bid proposals based on the benefits to 
26 ratepayers, which may include, but are not limited to:
27 (a)  Reduction in costs;
28 (b)  Decrease in peak electricity demand;
29 (c)  Deferral of investments in the transmission and distribution system;

31 (e)  Increase in the electricity grid's overall flexibility, reliability and resiliency; 
32 and
33 (f)  Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
34 (3)  An energy storage system that is not colocated with a Class IA resource may 
35 receive renewable energy credits only for stored energy generated from a Class IA 
36 resource.
37 (4)  If chosen for a contract under this section  subsection, an energy storage system 
38 must remain stationary and under the same ownership throughout the contract 
39 term.
40 (5)  The commission may permit an energy storage system to be paired with and 
41 added to a Class IA resource after that resource has been awarded a contract.
Page 3 - 131LR1019(01)1 For the purposes of this paragraph  section, "energy storage system" means a 
2 commercially available technology that uses mechanical, chemical or thermal 
3 processes for absorbing energy and storing it for a period of time for use at a later time.

20SUMMARY
21 This bill establishes an additional competitive solicitation for energy or renewable 
22 energy credits from qualified Class IA resources equal to 5% of retail electricity sales in

27 contaminated by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances that may no longer be used 
28 for agricultural purposes as determined by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
29 and Forestry or in accordance with applicable state and federal food safety laws and rules. 
30 Energy storage systems are eligible to receive a contract award if the energy storage system 
31 is colocated with the qualified Class IA resource on land that was previously developed or 
32 impacted land or agricultural land contaminated by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
33 substances that may no longer be used for agricultural purposes as determined by the
