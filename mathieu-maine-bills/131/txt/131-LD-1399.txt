13 delivery of health care services within the geographic region that will be served by 
14 a health care entity formed as a result of the material change transaction;
15 (8) The degree to which a health care entity involved in the material change 
16 transaction serves at-risk, underserved and government payer patient populations;

19 geographic region that will be served by a health care entity formed as a result of 
20 the material change transaction;
21 (10) Consumer concerns including, but not limited to, complaints or other 
22 allegations that a party involved in the material change transaction has engaged in 
23 unfair methods of competition or committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices; 
24 and
25 (11) Any other factors that the Attorney General determines to be in the public 
26 interest.
