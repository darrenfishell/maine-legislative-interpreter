91. Affected business entity.  "Affected business entity" means a partnership or an S 
10 corporation, but does not include a publicly traded partnership, as defined in the Code, 
11 Section 7704(b), that has agreed to file an annual return pursuant to section 5187 reporting 
12 the name, address, social security number or federal employer identification number and 
13 such other information required by the assessor of each member whose distributive share 
14 of partnership income derived from or connected with sources within this State is more 
15 than $500.
162.  Electing pass-through entity.  "Electing pass-through entity" means a pass-through 
17 entity that elects to pay taxes pursuant to section 5187.

19 A. A shareholder of an S corporation;

21 (1) A general partnership;

23 (3) A limited liability partnership; or
24 C.  A member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership or an S 
25 corporation for federal income tax purposes.
264.  Partnership.  "Partnership" has the same meaning as in the Code, Section 
27 7701(a)(2) and regulations adopted thereunder. "Partnership" includes a limited liability 
28 company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
295.  Pass-through entity.  "Pass-through entity" has the same meaning as in section 
30 5195, subsection 18.
316.  S corporation.  "S corporation" means a corporation or a limited liability company

35§5187.  Pass-through entity taxation election
Page 2 - 131LR2189(01)11.  Election.  A partnership or S corporation may elect to become an electing pass-
2 through entity in a tax year.  A separate election must be made for each tax year.
32.  Imposition and calculation of tax.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the 
4 contrary, a tax is imposed on an electing pass-through entity. The tax is the sum of each 
5 member's distributive share of Maine taxable income as calculated under this Part, 
6 multiplied by the highest rate of tax applicable to the individual under section 5111.  
73.  Carry-forward.  If the tax calculated pursuant to subsection 2 results in a net loss 
8 for the electing pass-through entity, the net loss may not be carried forward to subsequent 
9 tax years.
104.  Filing of return.  A nonresident individual who is a member of an electing pass-
11 through entity may not be required to file an income tax return pursuant to this chapter for 
12 a tax year if the member's only source of Maine income for that tax year is from an electing 
13 pass-through entity and the electing pass-through entity files and pays the tax due under 
14 this chapter.
155.  Report of pro rata share.  Each electing pass-through entity shall report to each of 
16 its members, for each tax year, the member's pro rata share of the tax imposed pursuant to 
17 this chapter.  
186.  Report of credit.  A subsidiary pass-through entity shall report to a parent electing 
19 pass-through entity the amount of the credit the subsidiary allocates to the parent electing 
20 pass-through entity. 
217.  Treatment of indirect credit.  A parent electing pass-through entity cannot claim 
22 the credit against the pass-through entity tax reported on its own return but shall flow 
23 through the indirect credit to its members.
248.  Amount of credit.  Each member of an electing pass-through entity is entitled to a 
25 credit equal to 90% of the member's share of the tax paid pursuant to this chapter.  If the 
26 amount of the credit authorized by this subsection exceeds the member's tax liability 
27 imposed pursuant to this chapter, the excess amount is refundable to the member.  A 
28 member claiming a credit pursuant to this subsection is not entitled to deduct from that 
29 member's Maine taxable income those amounts of Maine income taxes paid by the member 
30 on that member's distributive share of income from the electing pass-through entity.  
319.  Effect of taxes paid in and credit from other jurisdictions.  Each member that is 
32 subject to the tax imposed by this chapter as a resident or part-year resident of the State is 
33 entitled to a credit for the direct member's or indirect member's pro rata share of taxes paid 
34 to another state or to the District of Columbia on income of any partnership or S corporation 
35 of which the person is a member if the taxes paid to another state or to the District of 
36 Columbia result from a tax that the director of taxation for that state or the District of 
37 Columbia determines is substantially similar to the tax imposed pursuant to this chapter.  
38 A credit must be calculated in a form and manner prescribed by that director of taxation 
39 consistent with the provisions of this section.  If the amount of the credit authorized by this 
40 subsection exceeds the member's tax liability for the tax imposed pursuant to this chapter, 
41 the excess amount is not refundable and may not carry forward.  
4210.  Timing. Each affected business entity that is required to file a return under this 
43 chapter shall pay, on or before the 15th day of the 3rd month following the close of each 
44 tax year, to the assessor the tax as determined under this chapter.

6 return.
