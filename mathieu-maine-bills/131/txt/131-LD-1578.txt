4PROVISIONS REGARDING THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE FOR 
5PRESIDENT ACT
6§1310.  Duty of Secretary of State to provide notice of effect and discontinuation of 
7National Popular Vote for President Act
8 Upon receipt of notice that the states participating in the interstate compact to elect the 
9 President of the United States described in subchapter 1 hold a majority of the total electoral 
10 votes, the Secretary of State immediately shall inform the Governor, the President of the 
11 Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk 
12 of the House of Representatives and the Revisor of Statutes that the National Popular Vote 
13 for President Act governs the appointment of presidential electors.
14 If the Secretary of State is subsequently notified or learns that the National Popular 
15 Vote for President Act does not govern the appointment of presidential electors due to the 
16 number of electoral votes held by the states participating in the interstate compact to elect 
17 the President of the United States being less than a majority of the total electoral votes, the 
18 Secretary of State shall immediately inform the Governor, the President of the Senate, the 
19 Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the 
20 House of Representatives and the Revisor of Statutes of that fact.
21Sec. 12.  Legislative intent.  The text and numbering of the Interstate Compact:  
22 Agreement Among the States to Elect the President of the United States by National 
23 Popular Vote have been changed to conform to Maine statutory conventions.  The changes 
24 are technical in nature, and it is the intent of the Legislature that this Act be interpreted as 
25 substantively the same as the original interstate compact.
26SUMMARY
27 This bill adopts the Interstate Compact: Agreement Among the States to Elect the 
28 President of the United States by National Popular Vote, referred to as the National Popular 
29 Vote for President Act.   Under the compact, all of a participating state's electoral votes are 
30 awarded to the presidential slate that receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and 
31 the District of Columbia.  Since the compact takes effect only when the number of electoral 
32 votes held by the participating states equals a majority of the overall total number of 
33 electoral votes, currently at least 270 of the 538 electoral votes, the presidential slate that 
34 receives the most popular votes is declared the winning slate.
35 The bill also adjusts the use of ranked-choice voting to determine the electors in this 
36 State when the National Popular Vote for President Act governs the appointment of 
37 electors.  Under the bill, if no presidential slate receives a majority of the initial votes cast 
38 for president in the State, the count is determined by ranked-choice voting under the 
39 supervision of the Secretary of State.  Only the vote counts of the 2 slates in the final round 
40 of ranked-choice voting are forwarded by the Governor to the Archivist of the United States 
41 for determination of the national popular vote count.27

Page 7 - 131LR0183(01)1 To clarify the process under ranked-choice voting regarding candidates, the bill 
2 replaces the word "defeated" with the term "removed from consideration."
3 The National Popular Vote for President Act is only in effect when the number of 
4 electoral votes held by the participating states equals a majority of the overall total number 
5 of electoral votes, so that if that number falls below a majority, due to a state withdrawing 
6 as a member of the compact, the National Popular Vote for President Act will not govern 
7 subsequent presidential elections.  The Secretary of State is required to provide notice of 
8 both when the Act is in effect and when it has been discontinued.
