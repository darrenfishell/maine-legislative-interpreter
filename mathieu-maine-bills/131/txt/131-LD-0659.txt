Page 1 - 131LR0151(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  Home and community-based lifespan program.  The Department of 
3 Health and Human Services shall adopt routine technical rules pursuant to the Maine 
4 Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A establishing a MaineCare home and 
5 community-based lifespan program for individuals with intellectual and developmental 
6 disabilities, autism or other related conditions, referred to in this Act as "the lifespan 
7 program." On or after January 1, 2025, the department may begin enrollment in the lifespan 
8 program.  The department may seek waivers or other approvals from the federal 
9 Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
10 to implement the lifespan program.  The goals of the lifespan program are to:
111. Flexibility across the lifespan.  Provide home and community-based supports that 
12 can change over the member's lifespan as a member as described in this section and the 
13 persons who provide support to that member get older, without needing to move from one 
14 waiver program to another;
152. Seamless transitions. Expand upon the department's current childhood-to-
16 adulthood transition initiatives by including children beginning at 14 years of age and 
17 enable smooth transitions at later life stages;  
183. Early planning for independence.  Emphasize in-home supports, independent 
19 living skills and employment services for youth to prepare them for as much independence 
20 as possible in adulthood;
214. Innovation. Include service innovations currently under development, such as tiered 
22 shared living, standardized assessment of need, enhanced medical and behavioral health 
23 supports, self-direction, innovative employment supports, independent living options and 
24 remote support technology, including models of support that can be successfully 
25 implemented with a smaller workforce; and
265. Simplified and effective payment methods. Include alternative payment methods 
27 to promote quality and efficiency and reduce the administrative burden for service 
28 providers and the department.
29Sec. 2.  Relationship to existing programs.  The Department of Health and 
30 Human Services shall implement the lifespan program in 2 phases.  The target group for 
31 phase 1 of the lifespan program includes adults who would qualify for home and 
32 community-based services programs under rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, 
33 Chapter II, Section 21 or 29 and children beginning at 14 years of age who would meet all 
34 other eligibility criteria for Section 21 or 29 except age.  The target group for phase 2 of 
35 the lifespan program may include adults who would qualify for home and community-
36 based services programs under rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter II, 
37 Section 20 and children beginning at 14 years of age who would meet all other eligibility 
38 criteria for Section 20 except age.  When the lifespan program opens for phase 1 
39 enrollment, new enrollment under Sections 21 and 29 will be closed.  Members who are 
40 enrolled under Section 21 or 29 when enrollment is closed have the option of continuing in 
41 their current program or applying for enrollment in the lifespan program during phase 2.  
42 Individuals who are on a waiting list for enrollment under Section 21 or 29 when the 
43 lifespan program opens will be transferred to the lifespan program waiting list.
Page 2 - 131LR0151(01)1Sec. 3.  Appropriations.  Any appropriations made for the lifespan program may be 
2 used for purposes of the Department of Health and Human Services rule Chapter 101: 
3 MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter II, Section 29 until the lifespan program opens for 
4 enrollment.  When the lifespan program opens for enrollment, any unused appropriations 
5 for reserve slots in rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter II, Section 21 
6 must be used for the lifespan program for the same purpose.  When the lifespan program 
7 opens for enrollment, any appropriations for Section 21 or 29 that become available as a 
8 result of attrition of enrollment under Section 21 or 29 must be used for the lifespan 
9 program to expand access in that program.
10Sec. 4.  Lifespan stakeholder advisory group.  The Department of Health and 
11 Human Services shall create a lifespan stakeholder advisory group to advise the department 
12 on development and implementation of the lifespan program.  The stakeholder advisory 
13 group must include self-advocates; family members and other persons who provide 
14 support; advocates; service providers; and experts from higher education or research 
15 organizations.  The stakeholder advisory group shall meet at least 4 times per year until 
16 phase 2 implementation of the lifespan program is complete.
17SUMMARY
18 This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt rules to 
19 implement a MaineCare home and community-based lifespan program.  Initially, the 
20 program will enroll individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities or autism 
21 and, during a 2nd phase, individuals with other related conditions will be added.  Compared 
22 to the existing rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter II, Sections 21 and 
23 29 waiver programs, the lifespan program will enable supports to change over time within 
24 one program as an individual's needs change or the needs of persons who provide support 
25 to that individual change.  Also, eligibility for the lifespan program will begin at a younger 
26 age, enabling a smoother transition from childrenâ€™s services to adult services.  Once the 
27 lifespan program becomes operational, new enrollment under Sections 21 and 29 will be 
28 closed, but existing participants of those programs will have the option of continuing in 
29 their current waiver programs or transitioning to the lifespan program during the 2nd phase.18
