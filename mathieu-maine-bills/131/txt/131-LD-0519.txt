Page 1 - 131LR1064(01)1Sec. 1.  Vehicle-to-grid pilot project.  Resolved: That, beginning in 2024, the 
2 Efficiency Maine Trust shall design and operate a pilot project during the summer months 
3 to charge electric school buses at times when there are lower demands on the electric grid, 
4 and lower usage rates, in the State and discharge stored electricity to the electric grid when 
5 there are greater demands on the grid and higher usage rates.  The pilot project must be 
6 established at the Wells-Ogunquit Community School District for a period of 2 years and 
7 use the electric school buses purchased using the grant from the United States 
8 Environmental Protection Agency. The Efficiency Maine Trust shall work with interested

12 Maine Trust, no later than 90 days following completion of the vehicle-to-grid pilot project 
13 described in section 1, shall report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
14 jurisdiction over utility matters regarding the pilot project. The report must include an 
15 evaluation by the Efficiency Maine Trust of the pilot project, including the benefits to the 
16 climate and the potential revenue from expanding the pilot project to other school 
17 administrative units in the State. 
18SUMMARY
19 This resolve requires the Efficiency Maine Trust to design and operate a 2-year vehicle-
20 to-grid pilot project to use electric school buses to store energy from the electric grid during 
21 times of low demand and low usage rates and discharge the stored energy to the grid during 
22 times of high demand and high usage rates.  The pilot project must be operated at the Wells-
23 Ogunquit Community School District and use the electric school buses acquired by the 
24 district through a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The 
25 Efficiency Maine Trust is required to report on the results, including benefits to the climate 
26 and the potential for revenue.19
