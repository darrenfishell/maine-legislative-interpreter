2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §5205, sub-§6, ¶C, as enacted by PL 1981, c. 693, §§5 and

4Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §5205, sub-§6, ¶C-1 is enacted to read:
5 C-1.  A transfer approved under this subsection must continue to be considered in the 
6 best interest of the student and must be automatically renewed on an annual basis unless 
7 the superintendent of the school administrative unit to which the student transferred 
8 determines that:
9 (1)  The student's attendance is irregular;
10 (2)  The student is disruptive in class, at school or at school activities;
11 (3)  The student does not use best efforts to succeed in class; or
12 (4)  Based on the available facts, data and evidence, the transfer is no longer in the 
13 best interest of the student.
14 If a superintendent makes a determination under this paragraph, the superintendents 
15 shall review the transfer and the transfer may be discontinued. If a determination is 
16 made to discontinue the transfer, the superintendent of the school administrative unit 
17 to which the student was transferred shall notify the student and the student's parent of 
18 the determination and the facts, evidence and data used to make the determination. At

21SUMMARY
22 This bill repeals the provision in current law requiring superintendents to annually 
23 review transfers of students to a school administrative unit other than the one in which the 
24 student has permanent residence. The bill provides that such transfers must be 
25 automatically renewed on an annual basis unless a superintendent determines that the 
26 student's attendance is irregular, the student is disruptive, the student does not use best 
27 efforts to succeed in class or the transfer is no longer in the best interest of the student.22
