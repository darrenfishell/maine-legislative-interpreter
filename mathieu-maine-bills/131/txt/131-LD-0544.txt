Page 1 - 131LR1367(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA ยง11154, sub-ยง8, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 370, 
3 ยง8, is amended by amending the first blocked paragraph to read:
4 Each point entitles an applicant to one chance in the public chance drawing, except that, if 
5 a person is a resident of the State and is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States 
6 or Maine National Guard on active duty or is a veteran of either, that person accumulates 
7 points at a rate that is 2 times what is provided in paragraphs A to D. A person's 
8 accumulated points are eliminated and that person begins to accumulate points anew if in 
9 any year that person is selected to receive a moose hunting permit or if that person fails to 
10 purchase a new chance in any 2 consecutive years.
11SUMMARY
12 This bill increases the number of points that a person accumulates each year that person 
13 applies for a moose hunting permit but is not successful if that person is a Maine resident 
14 and a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or Maine National Guard on active 
15 duty or is a veteran of either.12
