17SUMMARY
18 This bill repeals a provision requiring the Director of the Maine Bureau of Veterans' 
19 Services to establish a process for a veteran who separated from service without an 
20 honorable discharge due solely to the veteran's sexual orientation or gender identity to have 
21 that discharge treated as an honorable discharge for purposes of determining the veteran's 
22 eligibility for rights, privileges and benefits granted to veterans under state law and replaces 
23 it with a provision establishing the Qualifying Review Board to review applications 
24 submitted by veterans who receive an other than honorable discharge for eligibility for 
25 rights, privileges and benefits granted to veterans under state law if the veteran believes the 
26 discharge characterization was based on the veteran's sexual orientation, gender identity or 
27 gender expression; conduct associated with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or 
28 acquired brain injury; or conduct or circumstances relating to being a victim of military 
29 sexual assault.  On approval of an application, the veteran is eligible for rights, privileges 
30 and benefits granted to veterans under state law.1
