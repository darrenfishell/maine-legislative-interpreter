5ยง9001.  Firearm industry member liability
61. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
7 following terms have the following meanings.
8 A. "Firearm industry member" means a person, firm, corporation, company, 
9 partnership, society, joint stock company or any other entity or association engaged in 
10 the sale, manufacturing, distribution, importing or marketing of a firearm-related 
11 product and any officer, agent, employee or other person authorized to act on behalf of 
12 the person, firm, corporation, company, partnership, society, joint stock company or 
13 other entity or association or who acts in concert or participation with one or more such 
14 persons, firms, corporations, companies, partnerships, societies, joint stock companies 
15 or other entities or associations. 
16 B. "Firearm-related product" means any firearm, ammunition, ammunition magazine, 
17 firearm component or part, including a firearm frame, firearm receiver or firearm 
18 accessory, that is or is intended to be sold, manufactured, distributed, imported or 
19 marketed in the State or that is possessed in the State and is reasonably foreseeable to 
20 be possessed or used in the State.
21 C. "Firearm trafficker" means a person who acquires, transfers or attempts to acquire 
22 or transfer a firearm for purposes of unlawful commerce.
23 D. "Reasonable controls" means reasonable procedures, acts or practices that are 
24 designed, implemented and enforced to:
25 (1) Prevent the sale or distribution of a firearm-related product to a straw purchaser, 
26 a firearm trafficker, a person prohibited from possessing a firearm under state or 
27 federal law or a person who the firearm industry member has reasonable cause to 
28 believe is at substantial risk of using a firearm-related product to harm the person 
29 or another person or of possessing or using a firearm-related product unlawfully;
30 (2) Prevent the loss or theft of a firearm-related product from the firearm industry 
31 member; or
32 (3) Ensure that the firearm industry member complies with all provisions of state 
33 and federal law and does not otherwise promote the unlawful manufacture, sale, 
34 possession, marketing or use of a firearm-related product.
35 E. "Straw purchaser" means a person who conceals or intends to conceal from a person 
36 that the purchase of a firearm-related product is being made on behalf of a 3rd party. 
37 "Straw purchaser" does not include a bona fide gift to a person who is not prohibited 
38 by law from possessing or receiving a firearm-related product. A gift to a person is not 
39 a bona fide gift if the person has offered or given the purchaser a service or thing of 
40 value to acquire the firearm-related product for the person. 
Page 2 - 131LR0010(01)12. Requirements for firearm industry members.  A firearm industry member shall:
2 A. Establish, implement and enforce reasonable controls; and 
3 B. Take reasonable precautions to ensure that the firearm industry member does not 
4 knowingly sell, distribute or provide a firearm-related product to a downstream 
5 distributor or retailer of firearm-related products that fails to establish, implement or 
6 enforce reasonable controls.
73. Prohibited conduct.  A firearm industry member may not knowingly manufacture, 
8 market, import, offer for wholesale sale or offer for retail sale a firearm-related product that 
9 is abnormally dangerous and likely to create an unreasonable risk of harm under this 
10 subsection to public health and safety in the State. For the purposes of this subsection:
11 A. There is a rebuttable presumption that a firearm-related product is abnormally 
12 dangerous and likely to create an unreasonable risk of harm to public health and safety 
13 if:
14 (1) The firearm-related product's features render the product most suitable for 
15 assaultive purposes instead of lawful self-defense, hunting or other legitimate sport 
16 and recreational activities;
17 (2) The firearm-related product is designed, sold or marketed in a manner that 
18 foreseeably promotes conversion of legal firearm-related products into illegal 
19 firearm-related products; or
20 (3) The firearm-related product is designed, sold or marketed in a manner that is 
21 targeted at minors or other individuals who are legally prohibited from accessing 
22 firearms; and
23 B. A firearm-related product may not be considered abnormally dangerous and likely 
24 to create an unreasonable risk of harm to public health and safety based on a firearm's 
25 inherent capacity to cause injury or lethal harm.
264. Violation and enforcement.  A person who has suffered harm in the State 
27 proximately caused by a firearm industry member's intentional or knowing violation of the 
28 requirements in subsection 2 or 3 may bring an action for the recovery of damages or 
29 injunctive relief in the courts of the State or federal district court.
305. Unfair trade practice.  A violation of subsection 2 or 3 is prima facie evidence of 
31 a violation of Title 5, chapter 10.
326. Prohibited defenses.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the 
33 following are not defenses to an action brought under this chapter:
34 A. Nonmutual issue preclusion or nonmutual claim preclusion; 
35 B. A defendant's ignorance or mistake of law; or
36 C. A defendant's belief that the requirements of this chapter are unconstitutional or 
37 were unconstitutional. 
387. Attorney's fees and costs.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 
39 including Title 5, section 213, subsection 2, a court may not award attorney's fees or costs 
40 to a defendant in an action brought under this chapter. 
418.  Exemptions.  Under this chapter:
Page 3 - 131LR0010(01)1 A. An action may not be brought by a person injured by a firearm-related product while 
2 that person was committing a crime;
3 B. The scope of any cause of action available to a person injured by a firearm-related 
4 product is not limited, other than as provided by this section; and
5 C. Recovery is not allowed for a self-inflicted injury that results from a reckless, 
6 wanton or willful discharge of a firearm-related product.
7SUMMARY
8 This bill creates a cause of action against a firearm industry member's intentional or 
9 knowing manufacturing, marketing, importing, offering for wholesale sale or offering for 
10 retail sale a firearm-related product that is abnormally dangerous and likely to create an 
11 unreasonable risk of harm to public health and safety in the State. A firearm-related product 
12 is not considered abnormally dangerous and likely to create an unreasonable risk of harm 
13 to public health and safety based on a firearm's inherent capacity to cause injury or lethal 
14 harm. A violation is prima facie evidence of an unfair trade practice, but attorney's fees and 
15 costs may not be awarded.  Exempted from the action are actions brought by persons 
16 injured with a firearm while committing a crime or self-inflicted injury from a reckless, 
17 wanton or willful discharge of the firearm.8
