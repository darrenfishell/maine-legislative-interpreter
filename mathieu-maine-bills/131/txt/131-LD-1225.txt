Page 1 - 131LR2275(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §5219-KK, sub-§2-D, as amended by PL 2021, c. 635, Pt. F, 
3 §1, is further amended to read:
42-D.  Credit in 2022 and after.  For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022 
5 and before January 1, 2023, a resident individual is allowed a credit against the taxes 
6 imposed under this Part equal to the amount by which the benefit base for the resident 
7 individual exceeds 4% of the resident individual's income. The credit may not exceed 
8 $1,000 for resident individuals under 65 years of age as of the last day of the taxable year 
9 or $1,500 for resident individuals 65 years of age and older as of the last day of the taxable 
10 year. In the case of married individuals filing a joint return, only one spouse is required to 
11 be 65 years of age or older to qualify for the $1,500 credit limitation. Married taxpayers 
12 filing separate returns do not qualify for the credit under this section.
13Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §5219-KK, sub-§2-E, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 703, §1, is 
14 amended to read:
152-E.  Permanently and totally disabled veterans; additional credit.  For tax years 
16 beginning on or after January 1, 2023, in addition to the credit under subsection 2‑D or 2-F, 
17 a resident individual who is a veteran who is 100% permanently and totally disabled is 
18 allowed an additional credit against the taxes imposed under this Part in an amount equal 
19 to the amount calculated under subsection 2‑D or 2-F. The combined credit under 
20 subsection 2‑D or 2-F and this subsection may not exceed the property taxes paid by the 
21 resident individual during the tax year on the resident individual's homestead in this State 
22 and rent constituting property taxes paid by the resident individual during the tax year on a 
23 homestead in the State, combined. In the case of married individuals filing a joint return, 
24 only one spouse is required to be a veteran who is 100% permanently and totally disabled 
25 to qualify for the additional credit allowed under this subsection. For the purposes of this 
26 subsection, "100% permanently and totally disabled" means having a rating by the United 
27 States Department of Veterans Affairs at 100% for one or more service-connected 
28 disabilities that are rated permanent and "veteran" has the same meaning as in section 653, 
29 subsection 1, paragraph E.

312-F.  Credit in 2023 and after.  For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, a 
32 resident individual is allowed a credit against the taxes imposed under this Part equal to the 
33 amount by which the benefit base for the resident individual exceeds 4% of the resident 
34 individual's income. The credit may not exceed $1,500 for resident individuals under 65 
35 years of age as of the last day of the taxable year or $2,000 for resident individuals 65 years 
36 of age and older as of the last day of the taxable year. In the case of married individuals 
37 filing a joint return, only one spouse is required to be 65 years of age or older to qualify for 
38 the $2,000 credit limitation. Married taxpayers filing separate returns do not qualify for the 
39 credit under this section.
