17 Amend the bill in section 8 in §568-B in subsection 1-A in the first 3 lines (page 3, 
18 lines 5 to 7 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "Appointed members of the review board

20 3-year terms." 
21 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
22 number to read consecutively. 
23 SUMMARY 
24 This amendment clarifies that, if the Board of Environmental Protection overturns an 
25 insurance claims-related decision on appeal, it is the Department of Environmental 
26 Protection and not the board that must pay reasonable costs incurred by the aggrieved 
27 applicant from the Maine Ground and Surface Waters Clean-up and Response Fund. The 
28 amendment also strikes language from the bill requiring the terms of members appointed 
29 to the Clean-up and Response Fund Review Board to be staggered.
