41.  Definition.  For the purposes of this section, "publisher" means an organization that

72.  Content rating requirements.  A publisher may not sell or distribute to a school

10 provided by this subsection. The publisher shall affix to the front cover of the book or 
11 written material a label indicating its assigned content rating.
12 A.  The publisher shall assign the content rating "BK-G" to a book or written material 
13 that is intended for all ages. Content with this rating may contain little or no profanity 
14 or violent or sexual themes.
15 B.  The publisher shall assign the content rating "BK-PG" to a book or written material 
16 that is intended to be read by young children only with the guidance of an adult. Content 
17 with this rating may contain sexual dialogue or situations, infrequent profanity and 
18 moderate violence.

21 may contain intensely sexual dialogue or situations, profanity and intense violence.
22 D.  The publisher shall assign the content rating "BK-MA" to a book or written material 
23 that is intended for persons 18 years of age or older. Content with this rating may 
24 contain explicit depictions of sexuality, strong profanity and graphic violence.

36 which must include the content rating the department determines appropriate for the book

9SUMMARY
10 This bill establishes a content rating system for books or written materials in school 
11 libraries.  The bill  requires that publishers that distribute books or written materials to a 
12 school administrative unit or public charter school for placement in their libraries assign 
13 such ratings to each book or material.  The Department of Education may disagree with the 
14 content rating assigned by the publisher and recommend a rating determined by the 
15 department to be appropriate.  In such case, the department must provide written notice to 
16 the publisher about the rating and the publisher must either change the rating according to 
17 the department's recommendation or cease all sales and distribution of the affected book or 
18 materials and issue a recall of all copies sold or distributed to a school administrative unit 
19 or public charter school.10
