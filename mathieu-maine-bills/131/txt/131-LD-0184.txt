Page 1 - 131LR0104(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 363 and Private and Special 
4 Law 2021, chapter 14 make a partial allocation of the state ceiling on private activity bonds 
5 to some issuers for calendar year 2023 but leave a portion of the state ceiling unallocated 
6 and do not provide sufficient allocations for certain types of private activity bonds that may 
7 require an allocation prior to the effective date of this Act if it is not enacted on an 
8 emergency basis; and
9Whereas, if these bond issues must be delayed due to the lack of available state
