11 amended to read:
123.  Family child care provider licensure; exception.  A family child care provider

15 commissioner under section 8302‑A and the fire safety requirements of section 8304‑A.  
16 The department shall make at least one unannounced inspection of a family child care 
17 provider licensed under this chapter during the term of the license.  The inspection must 
18 take place between 6 and 18 months after the issuance of the license.  If a family child care 
19 provider is caring for children living in that provider's home and is caring for no more than 
20 4 other children, or a group of more than 4 other children who are siblings, the provider is 
21 not required to be licensed as a family child care provider.
22SUMMARY

28 to be licensed by the department.23
