35SUMMARY
36 This bill prohibits licensing entities from using good character to evaluate applicants

38 government agencies, boards, departments and other governmental entities that regulate 
39 and issue occupational licenses within the State to offer a path to certification or licensure 
40 in the State to persons who hold occupational credentials from other states in order to allow 36
