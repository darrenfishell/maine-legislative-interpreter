3Whereas, the Constitution of Maine, Article IV, Part Third, Section 18 provides that 
4 the electors may propose to the Legislature, for its consideration, any bill, resolve or

8 Regular Session of the 131st Legislature; and
9Whereas, the effective date of any direct initiative enacted during the First Regular 
10 Session of the 131st Legislature, which is 90 days after adjournment, may occur during the

12 of an election; and
13Whereas, this Act seeks to delay the effective date of any direct initiative enacted 
14 during the First Regular Session until after the November 2023 election; and
