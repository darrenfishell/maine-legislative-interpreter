22 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, adds "independent" to 
23 the options a candidate may select for the candidate's political designation on a nomination 
24 petition and removes the provision from current law that requires a candidate intending to 
25 form a new party about that person's candidacy to use the proposed party's designation.
