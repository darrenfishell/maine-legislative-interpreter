Page 1 - 131LR0763(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the MaineCare program's hospital readmission protocol does not target the 
4 reduction of avoidable readmissions; and
5Whereas, the protocol penalizes hospitals for readmissions outside of the control of 
6 the hospitals and the exceptions to the protocol should reflect clinically appropriate care; 
7 and
8Whereas, it is essential that the issues with readmission be addressed as soon as 
9 possible due to the financial burden on the hospitals and for the proper care of the patients; 
10 and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore, be it
15Sec. 1.  Department of Health and Human Services to amend MaineCare 
16rules regarding hospital readmission. Resolved:  That, no later than 30 days after 
17 the effective date of this resolve, the Department of Health and Human Services shall 
18 amend the MaineCare benefits rules regarding exceptions to the 14-day hospital 
19 readmission protocol to:
20 1. Add to the exceptions readmission of an individual who previously left the hospital 
21 against medical advice;
22 2. Add to the exceptions readmission of an individual with substance use disorder 
23 whose primary or secondary diagnosis is a result of the individual's substance use disorder; 
24 and 
25 3. Remove from the exceptions readmission of an individual whose symptoms met the 
26 American Society of Addiction Medicine Level 4 Criteria, as defined in the most recent 
27 edition of the society's treatment criteria for addictive, substance-related and co-occurring 
28 conditions.
29Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
30 takes effect when approved.
31SUMMARY

33 MaineCare benefits rules by excepting from its readmission protocol individuals who 
34 previously left the hospital against medical advice or were previously discharged with 
35 substance use disorder when the individual's primary or secondary diagnosis is a result of 
36 the individual's substance use disorder.  It removes from the exceptions to the readmission 
37 protocol individuals who were previously discharged whose symptoms meet the American
