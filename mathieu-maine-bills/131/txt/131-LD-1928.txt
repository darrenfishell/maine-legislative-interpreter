3CHAPTER 39
4REGULATION OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL FEDERAL EXPENDITURES
5§1051.  Process for determining unconstitutional federal expenditures
61.  Request for opinion of justices.  Upon the belief that the Federal Government has 
7 made an expenditure of federal funds that is not authorized by the United States 
8 Constitution, either body of the Legislature may request the Supreme Judicial Court, 
9 pursuant to the Constitution of Maine, Article VI, Section 3, for a determination of whether 
10 the expenditure is an unconstitutional expenditure.  For purposes of this section, 
11 "unconstitutional expenditure" means an expenditure of federal funds that is not authorized 
12 under the provisions of the United States Constitution.  
132. Action based on affirmative answer.  If, pursuant to subsection 1, the Supreme 
14 Judicial Court answers that an expenditure is an unconstitutional expenditure, the 
15 Legislature by resolve may:
16 A.  Require for a limited duration, as specified in the resolve, employers to submit 
17 federal income taxes withheld from their employees to the Department of 
18 Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue Services pursuant to Title 
19 36, section 5250, subsection 1-A; and
20 B.  Require the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 
21 Revenue Services to:
22 (1)  Determine the amount of the unconstitutional expenditure borne by residents 
23 of this State; and  
24 (2)  Withhold from federal income taxes payable to the United States Internal 
25 Revenue Service the amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (1).
26Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §185-B is enacted to read:
27§185-B.  Setoff of federal income taxes against unconstitutional federal expenditures
28 Upon direction by the Legislature pursuant to Title 3, section 1051, subsection 2, the 
29 bureau shall set off an unconstitutional federal expenditure as provided in this section.  For 
30 purposes of this section, "unconstitutional federal expenditure" means an expenditure of 
31 federal funds that is not authorized under the provisions of the United States Constitution 
32 and is found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Judicial Court pursuant to Title 3, 
33 section 1051, subsection 1.
341.  Determination of set-off amount.  In order to determine the amount of the setoff, 
35 the bureau shall:
36 A. Determine the cost of the unconstitutional federal expenditure;
37 B. Determine the total federal appropriation for the federal fiscal year in which the 
38 unconstitutional federal expenditure is made;
Page 2 - 131LR1747(01)1 C. Divide the amount determined under paragraph A by the amount determined under 
2 paragraph B; and
3 D. Multiply the result obtained in paragraph C by the total amount of federal income 
4 taxes paid by resident and nonresident individuals who filed Maine income tax returns 
5 for the tax year during which the unconstitutional federal expenditure was made.
6 The assessor shall inform the Governor, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the 
7 House of the amounts determined pursuant to this subsection.
82.  Withhold federal income taxes.  The bureau shall establish within the Department 
9 of Administrative and Financial Services a segregated account, referred to in this section 
10 as "the segregated account."  The bureau shall transfer into the segregated account the 
11 amount of federal income taxes collected pursuant to section 5250, subsection 1-A equal 
12 to the portion of the unconstitutional federal expenditure attributable to Maine taxpayer 
13 funds as determined pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph D.
143.  Disbursement of set-off amount.  Funds withheld and transferred to the segregated 
15 account pursuant to subsection 2 must be disbursed as provided in this subsection.
16 A.  The Treasurer of State shall inform the State Controller and the assessor if the State 
17 receives an amount of federal funds less than the amount anticipated.  Upon such 
18 notice, the State Controller shall transfer from the segregated account to the General 
19 Fund an amount equal to the deficit of federal funds determined by the Treasurer of 
20 State.
21 B.  At the close of each state fiscal year, if funds remain in the segregated account, the 
22 assessor shall refund the funds to Maine taxpayers on a pro rata basis in direct 
23 proportion to the amount of federal taxes paid by the taxpayer for the prior tax year.
24Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §5250, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:
251-A.  Federal tax withholding.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 
26 when directed by law pursuant to Title 3, section 1051, subsection 2, paragraph A, an 
27 employer maintaining an office or transacting business in this State that makes payment to 
28 a resident individual or a nonresident individual of wages subject to tax under this Part, if 
29 required to withhold federal income tax from those wages, shall transmit to the assessor 
30 any federal income taxes withheld by that employer at the same time and in the same 
31 manner as the taxes due under this Part are transmitted to the assessor.  Except as provided 
32 in section 185-B, the bureau shall transmit the federal income taxes collected pursuant to 
33 this subsection to the United States Internal Revenue Service no later than 5 business days 
34 following transmission from an employer.
35SUMMARY
36 This bill establishes a procedure for the State to avoid paying for federal expenditures 
37 that are determined by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to be in violation of the United 
38 States Constitution.  
39 Upon a determination by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court that a federal expenditure 
40 is unconstitutional, the Legislature may require an employer in this State that withholds 
41 federal income taxes from its employees to remit temporarily, for a time determined by the 
42 Legislature, those withheld federal income taxes to the Department of Administrative and 36

44 Revenue Service.  The Legislature may also direct the bureau to determine the portion of 
45 the unconstitutional federal expenditure paid for with income taxes from Maine taxpayers 
46 and transfer that amount to a segregated account.  The funds in the segregated account are 
47 used to either make up a shortage in federal funding that the State is due, as determined by 
48 the Treasurer of State, or to provide a refund to Maine taxpayers on a pro rata basis in direct 
49 proportion to the amount of federal taxes paid by the taxpayer for the prior tax year.1
