26 attorneys and the Attorney General adopt policies and procedures by January 1, 2024 to

28 be followed in the event that there is a breach of attorney-client confidentiality. It also 
29 requires the Commissioner of Corrections to establish by January 1, 2024 mandatory 
30 standards for all county jails, holding facilities, short-term detention areas and correctional 
31 facilities protecting and ensuring the confidentiality of attorney-client communications and 
32 processes to be followed in the event that there is a breach of attorney-client confidentiality;
33 2. Directs the Attorney General to develop a training program by January 1, 2024 for

37 the board of trustees of the Maine Criminal Justice Academy and directs the board to

20 to each correctional facility and jail beginning on the Monday following the transmission;

42 processes for protecting and ensuring the confidentiality of attorney-client
