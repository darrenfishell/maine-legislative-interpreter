Page 1 - 131LR1234(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  16 MRSA ยง62 is enacted to read:
3ยง62.  Exception to rule against hearsay; forfeiture by wrongdoing
41.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings. 
6 A.  "Declarant" means the person who made the statement.
7 B.  "Hearsay" means a statement that:
8 (1)  The declarant does not make while testifying at the trial or hearing; and
9 (2)  A party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the 
10 statement.
11 C.  "Statement" means a person's oral assertion, written assertion or nonverbal conduct 
12 if the person intended the nonverbal conduct as an assertion.
13 D.  "Unavailable" means the declarant is considered to be unavailable as a witness 
14 because the declarant:
15 (1)  Is exempted from testifying about the subject matter of the declarant's 
16 statement because the court rules that a privilege applies;
17 (2)  Refuses to testify about the subject matter despite a court order to do so;
18 (3)  Testifies to not remembering the subject matter;
19 (4)  Cannot be present or testify at the trial or hearing because of death or a 
20 then-existing infirmity, physical illness or mental illness; or
21 (5)  Is absent from the trial or hearing and the statement's proponent has not been 
22 able, by process or other reasonable means, to procure the declarant's attendance.
232.  Statement offered against party that wrongfully caused declarant's 
24unavailability.  A statement offered against a party that wrongfully caused or acquiesced 
25 in wrongfully causing the declarant to be unavailable as a witness, when the party causing 
26 the declarant to be unavailable intended that result, is admissible as evidence in a criminal 
27 proceeding as an exception to the rule against hearsay. A party seeking to have the 
28 statement admitted under this exception must prove by a preponderance of the evidence 
29 that the opposing party wrongfully caused or acquiesced in wrongfully causing the 
30 declarant to be unavailable.
31SUMMARY
32 This bill codifies the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to the rule against hearsay, 
33 making an out-of-court statement made by an unavailable witness admissible when that 
34 statement is offered against a party that wrongfully caused or acquiesced in wrongfully 
35 causing the declarant's unavailability. The party seeking to have this type of statement 
36 admitted under this exception must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
37 opposing party wrongfully caused or acquiesced in wrongfully causing the declarant's 
38 unavailability. 32
