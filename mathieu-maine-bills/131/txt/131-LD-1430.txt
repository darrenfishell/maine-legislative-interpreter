2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, rural nursing facilities primarily serving MaineCare members are closing 
4 due to low reimbursement rates; and
5Whereas, adjusting the MaineCare program nursing facility reimbursement rate 
6 immediately is essential to prevent more nursing facilities from closing; and

15 1. For nursing facilities located on islands in the State that are not connected to the 
16 mainland, the department shall reimburse 100% of the actual costs of providing nursing 
17 services for MaineCare members; and
18 2. For all other nursing facilities in the State, the department shall reimburse the costs 
19 of providing nursing services for MaineCare members by multiplying the rate of 
20 reimbursement under subsection 1 by the percentage of MaineCare beds, except that 
21 reimbursement under this subsection may not be less than 30%.  The department shall 
22 determine the ratio under this subsection on a biannual basis.
