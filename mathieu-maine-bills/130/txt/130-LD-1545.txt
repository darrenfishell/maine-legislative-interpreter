Page 1 - 130LR0745(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, major developments in the State can result in greenhouse gas emissions; 
4 and
5Whereas, the State has set greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals and there is a 
6 need to immediately incorporate the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions in 
7 permitting decisions in order to meet those goals; and
8Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
11 therefore,
12Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
13Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §481, as amended by PL 1999, c. 468, §5, is further amended by 
14 adding after the 2nd paragraph a new paragraph to read:
15 The Legislature further finds that many developments because of their size and nature 
16 are capable of causing significant greenhouse gas emissions and that measures must be 
17 taken to minimize such emissions if the State is to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions 
18 reduction goals under section 576-A.
19Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §484, sub-§11 is enacted to read:
2011.  Greenhouse gas emissions.  If required pursuant to section 484-C, the developer will 
21 implement the measures necessary to minimize the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the 
22 development.
23Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §484-C is enacted to read:
24§484-C.  Greenhouse gas emissions reductions
251. Developer requirements.  If a proposed development is within a category of 
26 development types that are subject to the requirements of this article and that the 
27 department has determined by rule adopted pursuant to subsection 3 are likely to result in 
28 greenhouse gas emissions, the developer must submit a report to the department that:
29 A. Identifies all sources of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the proposed 
30 development; and
31 B.  In accordance with the rules adopted by the department pursuant to subsection 3, 
32 describes the measures that the developer proposes to implement to minimize the 
33 greenhouse gas emissions associated with the proposed development.
342. Requirement to demonstrate stated greenhouse gas emissions reductions 
35associated with proposed development.  If a proposed development is within a category 
36 of development types that are subject to the requirements of this article and the developer 
37 as part of the developer's development proposal states the development will result in 
38 greenhouse gas emissions reductions, the developer must demonstrate to the department's 
39 satisfaction and with quantifiable data how the proposed development will reduce 
40 greenhouse emissions. If the department finds the developer has not demonstrated that the 
41 proposed development will result in greenhouse gas emissions reductions, the department 
Page 2 - 130LR0745(01)42 may not consider the benefits of greenhouse gas emissions reductions in evaluating the 
43 impact of the proposed development.
33. Rules.  The department shall adopt rules that identify the categories of development 
4 types that are subject to the requirements of this article and that are likely to result in 
5 greenhouse gas emissions.  The rules must also specify the measures a developer must 
6 implement to minimize the greenhouse gas emissions associated with a proposed 
7 development as well as any additional standards for development determined necessary by 
8 the department to assist the State in achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reductions 
9 levels established in section 576-A.  The rules must also specify how the department will 
10 evaluate proposed developments in which the developer states the project will result in 
11 greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are major 
12 substantive rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
13Sec. 4.  38 MRSA §489-E, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 359, §4, is 
14 amended to read:
15§489-E.  Rulemaking
16 Rules adopted by the department pursuant to this article are routine technical rules 
17 except that rules adopted by the department after January 1, 2010 pursuant to section 484, 
18 subsections 1, 3, 4, 4-A, 5, 6 and 7 and rules adopted pursuant to section 484-C are major 
19 substantive rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
20Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
21 takes effect when approved.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill requires the Department of Environmental Protection to provisionally adopt 
24 major substantive rules that:
25 1.  Identify the types of development under the site location of development laws that 
26 would require a developer to submit a report to the department if the proposed development 
27 would result in greenhouse gas emissions;
28 2.  Specify measures a developer must take in order to minimize greenhouse gas 
29 emissions; 
30 3.  Consider additional standards that are necessary for developments that result in 
31 greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals; and
32 4. Specify how the department will evaluate proposed developments in which the 
33 developer states the project will result in greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
34 This bill also requires a developer of a proposed development identified in rules to 
35 submit a report to the department if the proposed development would result in greenhouse 
36 gas emissions. The report must include the source of the greenhouse gas emissions and the 
37 measures the developer would take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
38 Lastly, this bill requires a developer to demonstrate to the department’s satisfaction and 
39 with quantifiable data how a proposed development will result in the reduction of 
40 greenhouse gas emissions, if the developer of that project states as part of its development 
41 proposal that the project will result in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It 
42 specifies that if the department finds the developer has not demonstrated that the proposed 1
