3 Department of Education diplomas as follows.

5 have been identified as such by the United States Department of Education's migrant 
6 education program and immigrant students who have not been attending one or more 
7 schools in any one or more states or territories for more than 3 full academic years in the 
8 aggregate.
9 2. It amends the process for applying for a Department of Education diploma by 
10 requiring that the responsible school provide support for the completion and submission of 
11 an application for a Department of Education diploma for students who have experienced 
12 education disruption, provides that community providers may assist in the application 
13 process and specifies that a diploma may be issued to a student who completes the 
14 minimum requirements for a high school diploma and that, while the Commissioner of 
15 Education's review team may seek clarification on evidence submitted, the commissioner 
16 may not require additional information.
17 3. It amends the definition of "school work recognition plan" for students experiencing 
18 education disruption to specify that a school work recognition plan is developed and 
19 updated in collaboration among the responsible school, the student, the parent or guardian, 
20 previous schools, interim programs and other agencies. It also specifies that a school work

33 new responsible school, the new responsible school shall provide the student with an adult 
34 staff or mentor to facilitate the student's transition.
35 5. It requires a responsible school to assist a student experiencing education disruption 
36 in completing an application for the Department of Education diploma if the student will 
37 not be able to graduate by the end of the student's 4th year of secondary school.
38 6. It creates credit accrual options for a student experiencing education disruption who 
39 changes schools after the student's 2nd year of high school, requiring schools to either 
40 award credit for a similar course taken elsewhere, waive a specific graduation requirement 
41 or provide an alternative means by which the student can earn the needed credit in time to 
42 graduate.  It allows a student to receive a diploma from a previously attended school if the 
43 student can meet the graduation requirements of that school but cannot complete the new 
44 school's requirements.2
