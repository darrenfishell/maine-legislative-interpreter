26Sec. 2.  Purpose; legislative findings.  The purpose of this Act is to protect the 
27 safety, health and economic well-being of the people of this State by safeguarding them 
28 from the negative and harmful effects of excessive and unconscionable prices for 
29 prescription drugs. In enacting this section, the Legislature finds that:
30 1.  Access to prescription drugs is necessary for the people of this State to maintain or 
31 acquire good health;
32 2.  Excessive prices negatively affect the ability of the people of this State to obtain 
33 prescription drugs, and price increases that exceed reasonable levels endanger the health 
34 and safety of the people of this State;
35 3.  Excessive prices for prescription drugs threaten the economic well-being of the 
36 people of this State and endanger their ability to pay for other necessary and essential goods 
37 and services, including housing, food and utilities;
38 4.  Excessive prices for prescription drugs contribute significantly to a dramatic and 
39 unsustainable rise in health care costs and health insurance that threaten the overall ability 
40 of the people of this State to obtain health coverage and maintain or acquire good health;
41 5.  Excessive prices for prescription drugs contribute significantly to rising state costs 
42 for health care provided and paid for through health insurance programs for public 
43 employees, including employees of the State, municipalities and counties, school districts, 
Page 4 - 130LR1575(01)44 institutions of higher education and retirees whose health care costs are funded by public 
45 programs, thereby threatening the ability of the State to fund those programs adequately 
46 and further threatening the ability of the State to fund other programs necessary for the 
47 public good and safety, such as public education and public safety;
5 6.  Because the costs of prescription drugs and health insurance are tax-deductible, 
6 excessive costs for prescription drugs result in a reduction in the tax base and a consequent 
7 reduction in state revenue;
8 7.  The costs to consumers, health plans and the State for prescription drug coverage is 
9 higher than the costs in other countries because the prices charged by manufacturers and 
10 distributors of drugs in this State are higher; and
11 8.  Based on findings in subsections 1 to 7, the Legislature finds that excessive prices 
12 for prescription drugs threaten the safety and well-being of the people of this State and 
13 finds it is necessary to act in order to protect the people of this State from the negative 
14 effects of excessive costs.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill requires the Superintendent of Insurance to create a list of 250 referenced 
17 drugs that are subject to a referenced rate.  The referenced rate must be calculated as the 
18 lowest cost from official publications of certain Canadian provincial government agencies 
19 and the wholesale acquisition cost.  A state entity, health plan or participating plan qualified 
20 under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 must purchase 
21 referenced drugs to be dispensed or delivered to a consumer of this State at a cost equal to 
22 or lower than the referenced rate.  Any savings generated as a result must be used to reduce 
23 costs to consumers.1
