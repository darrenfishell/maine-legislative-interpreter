3§8.  Restructuring public schools  Public school innovation
4 The In order to support a culture of research and development and elevate the 
5 professionalism of the State's education practitioners, the commissioner shall encourage 
6 school administrative units to pursue an ongoing process of school restructuring continuous 
7 improvement processes to identify opportunities to innovate school structures and policies 
8 as a means of more effectively meeting the learning needs and improving the academic 
9 performance of all students.  The public and private postsecondary institutions of higher 
10 education in the State are urged to cooperate partner with the department, the state board 
11 and school administrative units to provide appropriate and timely professional development 
12 programs and other support services to educators employed in public schools engaged in 
13 school restructuring innovation efforts.
141.  School restructuring  innovation.  For the purposes of this section, the term "school 
15 restructuring  innovation" means the process by which schools and communities  use pilot 
16 programs and make significant changes in the existing school structure, including the 
17 policies, roles, relationships, pathways and schedules that influence teaching and learning 
18 in the school.  School restructuring innovation recognizes the critical educational role of 
19 technology and integrates technology and technological systems in the classroom, in school 
20 governance and in school record keeping.  School restructuring innovation is based on:
21 A.  The development of comprehensive educational goals establishing community 
22 expectations for what all students should know, the skills they should possess, the 
23 attitude toward work and learning they should hold upon completing school and the 
24 role of the school in the community;
25 B.  A formal appraisal of the basic structures that govern operation of the school; and
26 C.  A commitment to revise the basic school structure to achieve the comprehensive 
27 educational goals.
28 School restructuring  innovation, which is most effectively carried out at the local level, 
29 depends on community and educator involvement and approval and student participation.  
30 School restructuring innovation includes consideration of changing roles for empathetic 
31 understanding of the various roles of stakeholders, including parents, students, teachers, 
32 administrators, support staff, postsecondary education institutions and officials, and 
33 various segments of the community.  It focuses on understanding and defining the root 
34 cause of challenges and innovates and tests solutions. School innovation may include a 
35 significantly broadened role for schools and school administrative units that engage in 
36 education research and development.  The commissioner may designate a school 
37 administrative unit that engages in education research and development as a demonstration 
38 site.
39 School restructuring may include schools and school administrative units combining efforts 
40 to cooperatively pursue restructuring activities.  When that occurs, one or more schools or 
41 units may be designated as demonstration sites.
422.  Waiver of rules for local schools.  A school administrative unit undergoing school 
43 restructuring innovation may request that the commissioner waive the application of 
Page 2 - 130LR2310(01)44 specific rules to that unit, or to certain schools in that unit, if such action the waiver is 
45 necessary to achieve school restructuring  the proposed innovation.  The commissioner shall 
46 grant a waiver if the requesting unit, as determined by the commissioner, has:
4 A.  Demonstrated that one or more state rules prevent or seriously handicap the unit's 
5 pursuit of its restructuring innovation goals;
6 B.  Demonstrated that reasonable steps have been taken to provide the safeguards 
7 offered by the rules in question to allow continued educational progress by students 
8 and protect the continuity and integrity of the unit and employees of that unit;
9 C.  Provided evidence that the necessary resources and community and staff support 
10 are present to ensure that the restructuring innovative changes requiring the waiver 
11 stand a reasonable chance of succeeding; and
12 D.  Informed any bargaining agent or agents representing affected school employees 
13 of the waiver request; and .
14 E.  Established a working relationship regarding professional development with an 
15 institution of higher education or a professional development service provider.
16 The request for the waiver must include documentation to substantiate the conditions of 
17 this subsection.  If the request is denied, the commissioner shall provide the reasons for 
18 denying the request to the school unit.
193.  Waiver of rules for educator preparation programs.  In order to prepare 
20 educators to work in restructuring innovative schools, an educator preparation program 
21 may request that the state board waive the application of specific rules governing approval 
22 of that program.  The state board shall grant waiver requests if, in the board's opinion, the 
23 program has:
24 A.  Demonstrated that the rules for which a waiver is requested prevent or seriously 
25 handicap the program in its pursuit of a plan to meet the educational needs of its 
26 students and the staffing needs of restructuring innovative schools;
27 B.  Demonstrated that reasonable steps have been taken to provide the safeguards 
28 offered by the rules in question to allow continued educational progress by students 
29 and protect the continuity and integrity of the program and employees of that program;
30 C.  Provided evidence that the necessary resources and support from the governing 
31 body and staff of an institution of higher education are present to ensure that the 
32 changes requiring the waiver stand a reasonable chance of succeeding;
33 D.  Informed any bargaining agent or agents representing affected program employees 
34 of the waiver request; and
35 E.  Developed service, research and teaching relationships with one or more 
36 restructuring  innovative public schools.
37 The request for the waiver must include documentation to substantiate the conditions of 
38 this subsection.  If the request is denied, the state board shall communicate the reasons for 
39 denying the request to the petitioning program.

33 administrative unit by a private school is the rate established under subsection 1 or the state

35 value factor.  The insured value factor is computed by dividing 5% of the insured value of
