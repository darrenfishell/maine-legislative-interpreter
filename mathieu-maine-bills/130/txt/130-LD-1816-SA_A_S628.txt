This amendment reduces the ongoing General Fund cost of the bill by $200,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2022-

labor history and customized educational programs for the organized and unorganized labor force in the State. 
As amended, the bill still includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $500,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 
2022-23 to the University of Maine System for the establishment of a labor and community education center at the 
University of Southern Maine to provide labor education and outreach.
