2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill would amend the current law regarding electricity restructuring and retail 
6 electricity sales, replacing the State's default service, called standard-offer service, with full 
7 retail choice and competition to benefit consumers and help to deliver the jobs, economic 
8 development and other benefits of a fully competitive market.  The bill would ensure that 
9 all retail customers have adequate and efficient billing for electric service, increase the use 
10 of renewable and carbon-free resources in electricity generation, allow consumers to 
11 choose a rate that works for them from a mix of time-of-use rates and encourage innovative 
12 and broad on-bill financing programs to assist consumers with implementing beneficial 
13 electrification to help Maine achieve its climate goals.
