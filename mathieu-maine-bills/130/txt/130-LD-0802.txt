3CHAPTER 34-D
4SOLAR ENERGY DEVELOPMENT DECOMMISSIONING
5§3491. Definitions
6 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
7 have the following meanings.
81.  Decommissioning.  "Decommissioning" means the physical removal of all 
9 components of a solar energy development, including but not limited to solar panels and 
10 associated anchoring systems and foundations to a depth of at least 24 inches and other 
11 structures, buildings, roads, cables, electrical components or associated facilities and 
12 foundations to a depth of at least 24 inches, to the extent the components of the 
13 development are not otherwise in or proposed to be placed in productive use. 
14 "Decommissioning" includes the grading and revegetation of all earth disturbed during 
15 construction and decommissioning, except for areas already restored.
162.  Environmental permitting entity.  "Environmental permitting entity" means:
17 A.  The Department of Environmental Protection in the case of a solar energy 
18 development:
19 (1)  Located wholly or partly outside of the unorganized and deorganized areas; or
20 (2)  Subject to the department's jurisdiction pursuant to Title 38, chapter 3, 
21 subchapter 1, article 6; or
22 B.  The Maine Land Use Planning Commission in the case of a solar energy 
23 development located wholly in the unorganized and deorganized areas and not subject 
24 to the jurisdiction of the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to Title 38, 
25 chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 6.
263.  Farmland.  "Farmland" has the same meaning as in Title 36, section 1102, 
27 subsection 4.
284.  Transfer of ownership.  "Transfer of ownership" means a change in the legal entity 
29 that owns or operates a solar energy development.  A sale or exchange of stock or 
30 membership interests or a merger is not a transfer of ownership as long as the legal entity 
31 that owns or operates the solar energy development remains the same.
325.  Unorganized and deorganized areas.  "Unorganized and deorganized areas" has 
33 the same meaning as in Title 12, section 682, subsection 1.
34§3492. Prohibition
35 A person may not construct, cause to be constructed or operate a solar energy 
36 development with ground-mounted solar panels occupying 3 or more acres without first 
37 obtaining approval of a decommissioning plan from the environmental permitting entity 
38 under section 3495.
Page 2 - 130LR0139(01)1§3493.  Transfer of ownership
2 Upon a transfer of ownership of a solar energy development subject to a 
3 decommissioning plan approved under section 3495, a person that transfers ownership of 
4 the development remains jointly and severally liable for implementation of the plan until 
5 the environmental permitting entity approves transfer of the decommissioning plan to the 
6 new owner or operator.
7§3494.  Decommissioning plan
8 A decommissioning plan must:
91.  Decommissioning.  Provide for the decommissioning of a solar energy development 
10 to a depth of at least 24 inches;
112.  Farmland.  For any portion of a solar energy development located on land classified 
12 as farmland any time within 5 years preceding the start of construction of the development, 
13 provide for the decommissioning of that portion of the solar energy development to a depth 
14 of at least 48 inches and for the restoration of the farmland sufficient to support resumption 
15 of farming or agricultural activities;
163.  Grading and revegetation of earth.  Provide for the grading and revegetation of 
17 all earth disturbed during construction and decommissioning, except for areas already 
18 restored; and
194.  Financial capacity.  Include demonstration of current and future financial capacity, 
20 which must be unaffected by the owner's or operator's future financial condition, to fully 
21 fund decommissioning in accordance with an approved decommissioning plan under this 
22 chapter.
23§3495.  Standards
24 An environmental permitting entity shall approve a decommissioning plan whenever it 
25 finds the following:
261.  Successful decommissioning.  The plan, if implemented, will result in successful 
27decommissioning of the solar energy development, including the restoration of farmland 
28sufficient to support resumption of farming or agricultural activities;
292.  Financial assurance.  The person identified in the plan as responsible for 
30 decommissioning demonstrates financial assurance, in the form of a performance bond, 
31 surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit or other form of financial assurance acceptable to 
32 the environmental permitting entity, for the total cost of decommissioning; and
333.  Update.  The plan requires the financial assurance be updated no less frequently 
34 than every 5 years.
35Sec. 2.  Application.  This Act applies to a solar energy development on which 
36 construction begins on or after October 1, 2021 and to any other solar energy development 
37 that undergoes a transfer of ownership on or after October 1, 2021.
38SUMMARY
39 This bill requires a person to obtain approval of a decommissioning plan from the 
40 Department of Environmental Protection or from the Maine Land Use Planning 
41 Commission in the case of a solar energy development located in the unorganized and 
Page 3 - 130LR0139(01)42 deorganized areas before constructing or operating a solar energy development with 
43 ground-mounted solar panels occupying 3 or more acres.1
