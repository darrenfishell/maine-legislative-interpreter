13 An action for unpaid wages under this section may be brought by the affected employee

22 amended to read:

34 or established practice includes provisions for paid vacations, vacation pay has the same 
35 status as wages earned.  This bill provides that on cessation of employment all accrued 
36 vacation pay must be paid to the employee.
