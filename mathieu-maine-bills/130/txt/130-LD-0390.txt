19 available datasets, specifically for modeling in a geographic information system and for 
20 enforcement purposes by municipal officials; the addition of defined terms "contiguous," 
21 "adjacent," "surficially connected" and other similar operational terms; the selection 
22 distances for use in geographic information systems and field surveys; and the exclusion 
23 from the resource protection zone lots where less than 2,500 square feet of the lot would 
24 be zoned as resource protection.
