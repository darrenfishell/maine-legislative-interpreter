SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "#" to H.P. 608, L.D. 840, "An Act To Prevent 
Power Line Electrocutions" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §760, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 348, §1, is amended to read: 
§760. llldemnifieation Liability 
A person is liable to the owner or operator of the overhead high-voltage line and 3rd 
parties, if any, for all or part of the damages to facilities, and injuries to persons and all or 
part of the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred by the owner or operator of the overhead 
high-voltage lines and 3rd parties, if any, as a result of any contact with an overhead high­
voltage line if the person causes, permits or allows any work or activity in violation of a 
provision of this chapter and, as a result, a physical or electrical contact with an overhead 
high-voltage line occurs. The allocation of damages must be based on the comparative 
negligence of the parties as set forth in Title 14, section 156, except that employers of 
injured persons are immune from payment of damages to the extent provided under the 
Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill but retains the intent to limit the indemnification of 
the owner or operator of an overhead high-voltage line when the owner's or operator's 
negligence contributes to damages to facilities or injuries to persons. The amendment 
provides that, to the extent employers are liable under workers' compensation laws when 
employees are injured, employers are immune from the payment of damages under the 
Overhead High-voltage Line Safety Act.
