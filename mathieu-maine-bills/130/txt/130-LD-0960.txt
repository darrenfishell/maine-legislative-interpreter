21 further amended to read:
222.  Hazardous waste information and information on mercury-added products 
23and electronic devices; chemicals; recyclables Information designated as confidential.  
24 Information relating to hazardous waste submitted to the department under this subchapter, 
25 information relating to mercury-added products submitted to the department under chapter 
26 16-B, information relating to electronic devices submitted to the department under section 
27 1610, subsection 6-A, information related to products containing PFAS, as defined in 
28 section 1612, subsection 1, paragraph D, submitted to the department under section 1612, 
29 information related to priority toxic chemicals submitted to the department under chapter 
30 27, information related to products that contain the "deca" mixture of polybrominated 
31 diphenyl ethers submitted to the department under section 1609 or information related to 
32 reporting on reportable recyclable materials submitted to the department under section 
33 2145 may be designated by the person submitting it as being only for the confidential use

56 department to the municipality under this subsection is confidential and not a public record 
57 under Title 1, chapter 13.  In the event a request for such information is submitted to the 
58 municipality, the municipality shall submit that request to the commissioner to be 
59 processed by the department as provided in this subsection.

29 B.  The following products are exempt from this section:
30 (1)  A final product for which federal law governs notice of the presence of PFAS 
31 in the product in a manner that preempts state authority; and
32 (2)  A product subject to Title 32, chapter 26-A or 26-B.
335.  Fees.  The department may assess a fee payable by a manufacturer upon submission 
34 of the notification required under subsection 2 to cover the department's reasonable costs 
35 in managing the information collected. Fees must be established in department rules as set 
36 forth in subsection 9.
376.  Failure to provide notice.  A final product containing PFAS may not be sold, 
38 offered for sale or distributed for sale in this State if the manufacturer has failed to provide

40 from this prohibition if, in the department's judgment, the lack of availability of the final 
41 product could pose an unreasonable risk to public health, safety or welfare.1
