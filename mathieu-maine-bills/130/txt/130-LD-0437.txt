6 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
7 have the following meanings.
81. Commissioner.  "Commissioner" means the Commissioner of Agriculture, 
9 Conservation and Forestry.
102.  Department.  "Department" means the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
11 and Forestry.
123.  Greenhouse gas.  "Greenhouse gas" has the same meaning as in Title 38, section 
13 574, subsection 1.
144.  Greenhouse gas emissions benefits.  "Greenhouse gas emissions benefits" means 
15 greenhouse gas emissions source reduction or sequestration.
165.  Healthy soils best practices.  "Healthy soils best practices" means agricultural and 
17 land management practices that:
18 A.  Enhance the continuing capacity of soils to function as a vital, living biological 
19 system, increase soil organic matter, improve soil structure, strengthen water holding 
20 and nutrient holding capacity, improve nutrient cycling and result in net long-term 
21 greenhouse gas emissions benefits;
22 B.  Continuously improve the capacity of soils to host a diversity of beneficial 
23 organisms, grow vigorous crops, enhance agricultural resilience, including, but not 
24 limited to, the ability of crops and livestock to tolerate and recover from drought, 
25 temperature extremes, pests and other stressors, and help regulate the global climate 
26 by converting organic residue into stable soil organic matter and retaining nutrients, 
27 including, but not limited to, nitrogen and phosphorus;
28 C.  Continuously improve the health of soils by considering all relevant factors, 
29 including, but not limited to, depth of topsoil horizons, water infiltration rate, water 
30 holding capacity, organic carbon content, biologically accessible nutrient content, bulk 
31 density, biological activity and biological and microbiological diversity; and
32 D.  Follow the principles of minimizing soil disturbance and external inputs: keeping 
33 soil covered, maximizing biodiversity, maximizing the presence of living roots and 
34 integrating animals into land management, including grazing animals, birds, beneficial 
35 insects and keystone species, such as earthworms.

25 practitioners and technical experts and highlighting related services and 
26 programming; and
27 (3)  Aggregate and highlight opportunities for grant funding, loan programs and 
28 other forms of financial assistance to support the use of healthy soils best practices 
29 by farmers and farmland owners;

31 incentivize healthy soils best practices;

33 technical assistance, financial assistance and research support, to implement healthy 
34 soils best practices;
35 D.  Design the program to equitably distribute incentives to beginning and socially
