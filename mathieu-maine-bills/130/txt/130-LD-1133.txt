13 needs, the department shall include the following goals as part of its capital improvement 
14 plans and program delivery  asset management and work plan preparation.  The goals are

14 entity for the dismantling or changing of state-owned track  for a nonrail use.  When the 
15 department, in consultation with a regional economic planning entity and a regional 
16 transportation advisory committee established in accordance with rules adopted under 
17 section 73, subsection 4, determines that removal of a specific length of rail owned by the 
18 State will not have a negative impact on a region or on future economic opportunities for 
19 that region, the Commissioner of Transportation shall seek review by the joint standing 
20 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters prior to 
21 removal.
22 The Department of Transportation may not convert a state-owned rail corridor in which 
23 the department controls the right-of-way to a nonrail recreational or nonrecreational 
24 transportation use without following the rail corridor use advisory council process 
25 established under section 75 and without legislative approval.  If the Commissioner of 
26 Transportation receives a report from a rail corridor use advisory council established under 
27 section 75 that includes a recommendation of track removal or other change for nonrail use 
28 and the commissioner concurs with that recommendation, the commissioner shall seek 
29 legislative approval of the recommendation by submitting legislation to the joint standing 
30 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters prior to track 
31 removal or the other change for nonrail use. Legislation submitted under this section must 
32 include language stating that any track removal or other change for nonrail use is 
33 considered interim in nature and that the rail corridor will be preserved for future rail use 
34 as provided under this chapter.
