6 certified candidate who wins a general or special election, from engaging in fund-raising 
7 or decision making for a caucus political action committee, an unenrolled political action 
8 committee, a ballot question committee or a political action committee formed for the

11 action committee was established.
12SUMMARY
13 This bill allows the unenrolled members of the Senate and the unenrolled members of 
14 the House of Representatives to elect a leader who may designate an unenrolled political 
15 action committee to promote the election of unenrolled candidates to that body of the 
16 Legislature.  Like a caucus political action committee, an unenrolled political action 
17 committee may make unlimited donations to a candidate to fund a recount.  In addition, 
18 although Maine Clean Election Act candidates are generally prohibited from serving as the 
19 treasurer, principal officer, primary fund-raiser or primary decision maker for a political 
20 action committee, the bill authorizes Maine Clean Election Act candidates to engage in 
21 fund-raising or decision making for an unenrolled political action committee to the same 
22 extent that Maine Clean Election Act candidates may engage in such activities for a caucus 
23 political action committee.
