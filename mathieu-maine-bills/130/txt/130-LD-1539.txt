Page 1 - 130LR0884(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA ยง4320-Q is enacted to read:
3ยง4320-Q.  Coverage for fertility services
41.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings. 
6 A. "Experimental fertility procedure" means a procedure for which the published 
7 medical evidence is not sufficient for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 
8 its successor organization or a comparable organization to regard the procedure as 
9 established medical practice.
10 B. "Fertility diagnostic care" means procedures, products, medications and services 
11 intended to provide information about an individual's fertility, including laboratory 
12 assessments and imaging studies.
13 C. "Fertility patient" means an individual or couple with infertility or an individual 
14 unable to conceive as an individual or with a partner because the individual or couple 
15 does not have the necessary gametes for conception.
16 D.  "Fertility preservation services" means procedures, products, medications and 
17 services, intended to preserve fertility, consistent with established medical practice and 
18 professional guidelines published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 
19 its successor organization or a comparable organization for an individual who has a 
20 medical or genetic condition or who is expected to undergo treatment that may directly 
21 or indirectly cause a risk of impairment of fertility.  "Fertility preservation services" 
22 includes the procurement and cryopreservation of gametes, embryos and reproductive 
23 material and storage from the time of cryopreservation for a period of 5 years.  Storage 
24 may be offered for a longer period of time.
25 E. "Fertility treatment" means procedures, products, medications and services intended 
26 to achieve pregnancy consistent with established medical practice and professional 
27 guidelines published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, its successor 
28 organization or a comparable organization. 
29 F. "Gamete" means a cell containing a haploid complement of deoxyribonucleic acid 
30 that has the potential to form an embryo when combined with another gamete.  
31 "Gamete" includes sperm and eggs.
32 G. "Infertility" means the presence of a demonstrated condition recognized by a 
33 provider as a cause of loss or impairment of fertility or a couple's inability to achieve 
34 pregnancy after 12 months of unprotected intercourse when the couple has the 
35 necessary gametes for conception, including the loss of a pregnancy occurring within 
36 that 12-month period, or after a period of less than 12 months due to a person's age or 
37 other factors.  Pregnancy resulting in a loss does not cause the time period of trying to 
38 achieve a pregnancy to be restarted.
392.  Required coverage.  A carrier offering a health plan in this State shall provide 
40 coverage as provided in this subsection to an enrollee: 
41 A.  For fertility diagnostic care; 
42 B.  For fertility treatment if the enrollee is a fertility patient; and 
Page 2 - 130LR0884(01)1 C.  For fertility preservation services.
2 Coverage under this subsection must include evaluations, laboratory assessments, 
3 medications and procedures intended to achieve pregnancy, including but not limited to the 
4 procurement of donor gametes.  Coverage must be provided to the same extent that 
5 coverage is provided for other medical services or prescription drugs.  Coverage under this 
6 subsection may not be denied to any enrollee who foregoes a particular fertility treatment 
7 or fertility preservation service if a provider determines that such fertility treatment or 
8 fertility preservation service is likely to be unsuccessful.
93.  Limitations on coverage.  A health plan that provides coverage for the services 
10 required by this section may include reasonable limitations to the extent that these 
11 provisions are not inconsistent with the following requirements.
12 A. A carrier may not impose deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, maximum benefits, 
13 waiting periods or other limitations that are different from those that are imposed on 
14 coverage for other services under the health plan or any limitations on coverage for 
15 prescribed fertility medication that are different from those that are imposed on other 
16 prescription medication. 
17 B. A carrier may not use any prior diagnosis or prior fertility treatment as a basis for 
18 excluding, limiting or otherwise restricting the availability of coverage required by this 
19 section. 
20 C. A carrier may not impose any limitations on coverage for any fertility services based 
21 on an enrollee's use of donor gametes, donor embryos or surrogacy.
22 D. A carrier may not impose any limitations on coverage solely based on arbitrary 
23 factors, such as number of conception attempts, dollar amounts or age of an enrollee, 
24 or provide different benefits to or impose different requirements on a class of persons 
25 protected under Title 5, chapter 337 than those limitations placed on other enrollees. 
26 E. Any limitations imposed by a carrier must be based on an enrollee's medical history 
27 and clinical guidelines.  Any clinical guidelines used by a carrier must be maintained 
28 in written form and must be made available to an enrollee in writing upon request.  
29 Clinical guidelines developed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, its 
30 successor organization or a comparable organization may serve as a basis for a carrier's 
31 clinical guidelines.  Making, issuing, circulating or causing to be made, issued or 
32 circulated any clinical guidelines that are based on data that are not reasonably current 
33 or that do not cite with any specificity any reference relied upon constitutes an unfair 
34 or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance pursuant to section 2152.
354.  Certain services not required.  This section does not require a carrier to provide 
36 coverage for: 
37 A. Any experimental fertility procedure; or 
38 B. Any nonmedical costs related to donor gametes, donor embryos or surrogacy. 
395.  Rules.  The superintendent shall adopt rules as necessary to implement the 
40 requirements of this section. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical 
41 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
42Sec. 2.  Application.  This Act applies to all policies, contracts and certificates 
43 executed, delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after 
Page 3 - 130LR0884(01)44 January 1, 2023. For purposes of this Act, all contracts are deemed to be renewed no later 
45 than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.
