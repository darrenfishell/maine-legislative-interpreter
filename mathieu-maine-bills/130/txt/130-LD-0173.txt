4 subsection, shall establish a process for a veteran who separated from service without an

11 treated as an honorable discharge for purposes of state law, the director shall record 
12 this information in the records management system maintained pursuant to subsection 
13 8 and shall provide the veteran with a written certificate verifying the upgraded 
14 discharge status for state law purposes. The director shall assist a veteran to whom a 
15 certificate is issued under this paragraph in applying for an upgrade of that veteran's 
16 discharge status under federal law, if such an upgrade would entitle the veteran to 
17 receive federal benefits.
18 B.  All state and municipal departments and agencies shall accept a certificate issued 
19 by the director under paragraph A as evidence that the veteran who is the subject of the 
20 certificate qualifies as a veteran with an honorable discharge for purposes of

24 municipal departments and agencies under this paragraph.
25 C.  The director shall implement an outreach program to inform veterans of the process 
26 established under this subsection and to inform veterans that, through this process, they 
27 may be able to receive privileges and benefits that were previously denied under state 
28 law.
29 D.  For purposes of this subsection, "gender identity" has the same meaning as in Title 
30 5, section 4553, subsection 5-C; "sexual orientation" has the same meaning as in Title 
31 5, section 4553, subsection 9-C; and "veteran" means a person who served in the United

33 Maine National Guard or the Active Guard Reserve.

38Sec. 3.  Report.  The Director of the Maine Bureau of Veterans' Services within the

40 states have established processes for reviewing and potentially upgrading the discharge 
41 status, for state law purposes, of veterans who have been diagnosed with post-traumatic 
42 stress disorder or traumatic brain injury or who have been diagnosed with psychological 
43 trauma resulting from sexual assault or sexual harassment during military service as
