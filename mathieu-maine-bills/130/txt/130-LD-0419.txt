Page 1 - 130LR0501(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA ยง1606, sub-ยง1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 506, ยง1, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Participation in public works projects authorized.  The sheriff in charge of a 
5 county jail, or the sheriff of a county that shares a regional jail with other counties, may 
6 permit certain inmates of that jail, including inmates charged with a crime or awaiting 
7 sentence, to participate in public works-related projects or in the improvement of property 
8 owned by charitable organizations in that county or another county.  A project or 
9 improvement must be supervised by the sheriff of the county in which the project or 
10 improvement is being conducted.  The sheriff may request payment from charitable 
11 organizations for the transportation of the prisoners and for the transportation and per diem 
12 compensation for any guards who accompany the prisoners.  For the purposes of this 
13 section, "charitable organization" means any nonprofit organization organized or 
14 incorporated in this State or having a principal place of business in this State that is exempt 
15 from federal income taxation under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
16 Section 501(a), because the nonprofit organization is described in the United States Internal 
17 Revenue Code of 1986, Section 501(c)(3).
18SUMMARY
19 This bill allows inmates in a jail who are charged with a crime or awaiting sentence to 
20 participate in public works projects.
