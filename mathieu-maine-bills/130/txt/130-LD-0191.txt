Page 1 - 130LR0395(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง6234 is enacted to read:
3ยง6234.  Municipal authority; veterans
4 The legislative body of a municipality may by ordinance adopt a program to provide 
5 benefits to veterans with homesteads in the municipality.
61.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following 
7 meanings.
8 A.  "Homestead" has the same meaning as in section 6201, subsection 5.
9 B.  "Veteran" has the same meaning as in section 653, subsection 1, paragraph E and 
10 includes any family members eligible for an exemption under that subsection.
112.  Conditions of program.  A program adopted under this section must:
12 A.  Require that the claimant has maintained a homestead in the municipality for a 
13 certain period of time, as determined by the municipality;
14 B.  Provide benefits for both owners and renters of homesteads; and
15 C. Calculate benefits in a way that provides that:
16 (1)  If the claimant is the owner of the property, the benefit is equal to the difference 
17 between the reduction in property tax due to the exemptions provided in section 
18 653 and the amount of property tax reduction that would have applied if the 
19 assessed value of the property was the same as the just value; and
20 (2)  If the claimant is a renter, the benefit is equal to $100.
213.  Repeal of program.  A municipality that has adopted a program under this section 
22 may repeal it through the same procedure by which the program was adopted.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill authorizes municipalities to adopt a program that provides benefits to veterans 
25 and their eligible family members who own or rent a homestead in the municipality.  The 
26 benefit for owners is based on the impact of property tax equalization on the amount 
27 received as a property tax exemption compared to the amount that would have applied if 
28 no equalization was applied.  The benefit for renters is $100.
