2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §8301-A, sub-§1-A, ¶C, as amended by PL 2005, c. 530, §7, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 C.  "Family child care provider" means a person who provides day care in that person's 
5 home on a regular basis, for consideration, for 3 to 12 children under 13 years of age 
6 who are not the children of the provider or who are not residing in the provider's home.  
7 If a provider is caring for children living in that provider's home and is caring for no 
8 more than 2  3 other children, the provider is not required to be certified as a family 
9 child care provider.
10Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §8301-A, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2005, c. 640, §3, is further 
11 amended to read:
123.  Family child care provider certification.  A family child care provider shall pay 
13 the certification fee required under section 8303‑A.  A family child care provider must be 
14 certified under this chapter and shall comply with the rules adopted by the commissioner 
15 under section 8302‑A and the fire safety requirements of section 8304‑A.  The department 
16 shall make at least one unannounced inspection of a family child care provider certified 
17 under this chapter during the term of the certificate.  The inspection must take place 
18 between 6 and 18 months after the issuance of the certificate.  Notwithstanding the limit of 
19 3 other children a provider may care for in the provider's home without being required to 
20 be certified as a family care provider as permitted in subsection 1-A, paragraph C, a 
21 provider who is not certified as a family care provider may care for a 4th child if at least 2 
22 of the children being cared for are siblings. 
23SUMMARY
24 This bill increases from 2 to 3 the number of children a family care provider may care 
25 for in the provider's home, not including the provider's children, before the provider is 
26 required to be certified as a family care provider.  This bill also specifies that the sibling of 
27 one of the children under the care of a provider, not a child of the provider, does not count 
28 toward the limit of 3.
29 These provisions were part of the Governor's Executive Order No. 20 FY 19/20
