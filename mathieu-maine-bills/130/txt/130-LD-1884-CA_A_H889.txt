24 This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment removes 
25 from the bill the provisions that prohibit a municipality from requiring: 
26 1. A condition of residential construction in an agricultural zone that is more restrictive 
27 than any condition on farmland under the State's farm tax law; and 
28 2. A minimum lot size for zones primarily used for agriculture that is more than twice 
29 the minimum lot size of the most restrictive residential zone in that municipality. 
30 The amendment retains the provision that provides that a municipality may not 
31 establish an income requirement as a condition for residential construction in any zone 
32 regardless of the zone's primary use. The amendment also removes the emergency 
33 preamble and emergency clause.
