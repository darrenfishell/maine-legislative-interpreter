7 A.  Through the competitive solicitations  under this section  described in subparagraphs 
8 (1) and (2), the commission shall procure an amount of energy or renewable energy 
9 credits from Class IA resources that is equal to 14% of retail electricity sales in this 
10 State for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, as determined by the 
11 commission.
12 (1)  The commission shall initiate a first competitive solicitation under this 
13 paragraph and ensure that solicitation results in the approval of contracts by 
14 December 31, 2020 for energy or renewable energy credits equal to at least 7% of 
15 retail electricity sales for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, 
16 as determined by the commission. If the commission determines that contracts for 
17 an amount greater than 7% of retail electricity sales will provide financial benefits

19 retail electricity sales.
20 (2)  No later than January 15, 2021, the commission shall initiate a 2nd competitive 
21 solicitation under this paragraph for an amount of energy or renewable energy 
22 credits equal to the difference between 14% of retail electricity sales and the 
23 amount approved in contracts by December 31, 2020.
24 B.  To the extent sufficient resources are available, with respect to the competitive 
25 solicitations described in paragraph A, subparagraphs (1) and (2), 75% of the energy

13 receive renewable energy credits only for stored energy generated from a Class IA 
14 resource.
15 (4)  If chosen for a contract under this section, an energy storage system must 
16 remain stationary and under the same ownership throughout the contract term.
17 (5)  The commission may permit an energy storage system to be paired with and 
18 added to a Class IA resource after that resource has been awarded a contract.
19 For the purposes of this paragraph, "energy storage system" means a commercially 
20 available technology that uses mechanical, chemical or thermal processes for absorbing 
21 energy and storing it for a period of time for use at a later time.
22Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3210-G, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
234.  Rules.  The commission may adopt rules necessary for the implementation of this 
24 section.  Rules adopted by the commission may include, but are not limited to, provisions 
25 stipulating the financial security mechanisms that will be required as a condition of the 
26 selection of Class IA resources for contracts under this section.  Rules adopted pursuant to 
27 this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 
28 2-A.
29SUMMARY
30 This bill amends the State's renewable portfolio standard procurement law to authorize

33 equal to 15% of retail electricity sales in the State during calendar year 2019.  It requires 
34 100% of the energy or renewable energy credits contracted following those additional 
35 competitive solicitations to come from Class IA resources that begin commercial 
36 operations after June 30, 2021.
37 The bill also amends the renewable portfolio standard procurement law to require the 
38 Public Utilities Commission, in conducting the solicitation and selection of Class IA
