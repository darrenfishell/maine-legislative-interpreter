Page 1 - 130LR0486(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §2513, first ¶, as amended by PL 2011, c. 331, §12 and affected 
3 by §§16 and 17, is further amended to read:
4 Every Except as provided in section 2513-C, every insurance company or association 
5 that does business or collects premiums or assessments including annuity considerations in 
6 the State, including surety companies and companies engaged in the business of credit 
7 insurance or title insurance, shall, for the privilege of doing business in this State and in 
8 addition to any other taxes imposed for that privilege, pay a tax upon all gross direct 
9 premiums including annuity considerations, whether in cash or otherwise, on contracts 
10 written on risks located or resident in the State for insurance of life, annuity, fire, casualty 
11 and other risks at the rate of 2% a year.  Every nonadmitted insurer that does business or 
12 collects premiums in the State shall, for the privilege of doing business in this State and in 
13 addition to any other taxes imposed for that privilege, pay a tax upon all gross direct 
14 premiums, whether in cash or otherwise, as provided in section 2531.  For purposes of this 
15 section  chapter, the term "annuity considerations" includes amounts paid to an insurance 
16 company for the purchase of a contract that may result in an annuity, even if the 
17 annuitization never occurs or does not occur until some time in the future and the amounts 
18 are in the meantime applied to an investment vehicle other than an annuity.  This section 
19 does not apply to mutual fire insurance companies subject to tax under section 2517 or to 
20 captive insurance companies formed or licensed under Title 24-A, chapter 83 or under the 
21 laws of another state.
22Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §2513-C is enacted to read:
23§2513-C.  Tax on annuity considerations
241.  Phase-out of tax.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the rate of 
25 tax under this chapter for annuity considerations is 1.8% in calendar year 2022, 1.6% in 
26 calendar year 2023, 1.4% in calendar year 2024, 1.2% in calendar year 2025, 1% in 
27 calendar year 2026, 0.8% in calendar year 2027, 0.6% in calendar year 2028, 0.4% in 
28 calendar year 2029 and 0.2% in calendar year 2030. Beginning in calendar year 2031, 
29 annuity considerations are not subject to tax under this chapter, but taxes due for previous 
30 years may be collected.
312.  Application of reduced rate on annuities.  The reduced rates specified in 
32 subsection 1 for calendar years 2022 to 2030 apply to premiums on an annuity paid by 
33 annuity holders in this State only if the tax savings from the reduced rate are credited to the 
34 annuity holders. Upon request of the bureau, an insurer shall submit evidence that 
35 establishes that the tax savings derived from the reduced rate under this section have been 
36 credited to the annuity holders.
373.  Foreign insurance companies.  Section 2519 does not apply to annuity 
38 considerations subject to tax under this section.
39Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §2515, as amended by PL 2013, c. 331, Pt. C, §11, is further 
40 amended to read:
41§2515.  Amount of tax
42 In determining the amount of tax due under sections 2513 and 2531, each company 
43 shall deduct from the full amount of gross direct premiums the amount of all direct return 
Page 2 - 130LR0486(01)44 premiums on the gross direct premiums and all dividends paid to policyholders on direct 
45 premiums, and the tax must be computed by those companies or their agents.  Except when 
46 direct return premiums are returned in the same tax year that the premium was paid, the 
47 deduction allowed in this section may be taken only if the tax under this Part has been paid.  
48 For tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the deductions under this section 
49 related to annuity considerations may be deducted only from annuity considerations.
7SUMMARY
8 This bill phases out the insurance premium tax on annuity considerations over 10 years 
9 beginning in 2022 and provides that during the phase-out period the retaliatory tax on non-
10 Maine insurance companies does not apply.  The bill also specifies that certain deductions 
11 related to annuities may be deducted from annuity considerations for tax periods beginning 
12 on or after January 1, 2022.1
