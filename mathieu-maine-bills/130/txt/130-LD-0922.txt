41.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings. 
6 A.  "Fertility preservation services" means fertility preservation procedures consistent 
7 with established medical practice and professional guidelines published by the 
8 American Society for Reproductive Medicine or the American Society of Clinical 
9 Oncology or their successor organizations. 
10 B.  "Iatrogenic infertility" means an impairment of fertility caused by surgery for the 
11 treatment of cancer, radiation, chemotherapy or any other cancer treatment affecting 
12 reproductive organs or processes. 
132.  Required coverage.  Except as provided in subsection 4, a carrier offering a health 
14 plan in this State shall provide coverage for fertility preservation services for an enrollee 
15 who is at least 18 years of age and has been diagnosed with cancer for which necessary 
16 cancer treatment may directly or indirectly cause iatrogenic infertility. 
173.  Limits; deductible; copayment; coinsurance.  A health plan that provides 
18 coverage required by this section may contain provisions for maximum benefits and 
19 coinsurance and reasonable limitations, deductibles and exclusions to the extent that these 
20 provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements of this section.
214.  Exclusion for religious employer.  A religious employer may request and a carrier 
22 shall grant an exclusion under the policy or contract for the coverage required by this 
23 section if the required coverage conflicts with the religious employer's bona fide religious 
24 beliefs and practices.  A religious employer that obtains an exclusion under this subsection 
25 shall provide prospective enrollees and enrollees under its policy written notice of the 
26 exclusion.  For the purposes of this section, "religious employer" means an employer that

28 that is controlled, operated or principally supported by a church or by a convention or 
29 association of churches as defined in 26 United States Code, Section 3121(w)(3)(A) and
