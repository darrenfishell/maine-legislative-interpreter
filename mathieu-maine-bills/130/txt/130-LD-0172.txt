2Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §13794, first ¶, as amended by PL 2019, c. 34, §5, is further 
3 amended to read:
4 Every drug dispensed pursuant to prescription, whether for a legend drug or not, must 
5 carry on the label the following information: the prescription number; the date of filling; 
6 the patient's name; directions for use; the name and strength of the drug and the amount 
7 dispensed, including either the brand name of the drug or, if a generic and therapeutically 
8 equivalent drug or interchangeable biological product is dispensed the label must be , 
9 information in accordance with section 13781; the beyond use date of the drug; the name 
10 of the practitioner prescribing the drug; and the name, address and telephone number of the 
11 pharmacy where the prescription was compounded and dispensed; and a barcode that 
12 allows the patient to digitally access the information on the label.  For purposes of this 
13 section, "barcode" means a 2-dimensional machine-scannable barcode that can be read by 
14 a camera in a mobile device, such as a smartphone, and is used for storing information or 
15 directing or leading a user to additional information.  For purposes of this section, "beyond 
16 use date" means a date beyond which the contents of the prescription are not recommended 
17 to be used.
18Sec. 2.  Maine Board of Pharmacy rulemaking.  By January 1, 2022, the 
19 Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Maine Board of Pharmacy shall 
20 adopt rules to implement the requirement in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 32, section 
21 13794 that a barcode that allows a patient to digitally access prescription information 
22 appear on a prescription label.  Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical 
23 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
24SUMMARY
25 This bill requires a 2-dimensional machine-scannable barcode that allows a patient to 
26 digitally access prescription information to appear on the prescription label.  It also makes 
27 a clarifying technical correction.
