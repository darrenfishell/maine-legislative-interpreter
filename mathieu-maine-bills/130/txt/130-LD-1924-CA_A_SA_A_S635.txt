This amendment eliminates the ongoing General Fund appropriations in the bill of $340,000 per year beginning in 
fiscal year 2022-23 to the University of Maine System to establish a rural practice clinic in Aroostook County as part 
of a 3-year pilot program. 
As amended, this bill still requires the University of Maine System to establish a rural practice clinic in Aroostook 
County as a 3-year pilot project of the existing legal aid clinic at the University of Maine School of Law. Funding for 
the first 2 years of the pilot project will be provided by a payment of $680,000 to the University of Maine System 
from the funds received by the Office of the Attorney General for antitrust enforcement and enforcement of the Unfair 
Trade Practices Act.
