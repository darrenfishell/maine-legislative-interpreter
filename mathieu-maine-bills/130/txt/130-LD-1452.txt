38Sec. 6.  28-B MRSA §702, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
393.  Certificate of approval.  A licensee shall obtain a certificate of approval from the

Page 2 - 130LR1241(01)42 to appeal particularly to persons under 21 years of age, through an administrative review 
43 of data identifying the proposed target audience of the advertising or behavioral data of 
44 potential customers, compiled by the licensee, indicating that the content, design, 
45 dissemination or publication of the advertising is not knowingly intended to or designed to 
46 solicit persons under 21 years of age.  The standard of review by the department is a 
47 preponderance of the evidence and, in the case of denial, the department shall provide the 
48 licensee with a written finding of facts to support the denial.  A denial of a certificate of 
49 approval is subject to appeal under Title 5, section 11001 or appeal to Superior Court under

14 the denial or violation to Superior Court.  If a licensee appeals a violation by the department 
15 that an advertisement of the licensee is in violation of this section, the department may not 
16 suspend or revoke the licensee's license or take any action to interfere with or prevent the 
17 operation of the licensee's business while the appeal is pending.  If the court upholds the 
18 order of the department, the licensee has 15 days from the date of the decision to remedy 
19 the violation without any sanction, fine or penalty.
20SUMMARY
21 This bill amends the laws regarding the advertising and marketing of adult use 
22 marijuana or marijuana product by requiring marijuana establishment licensees to seek a 
23 certificate of approval for any advertisement of the licensees.  The Department of 
24 Administrative and Financial Services is required to determine by a preponderance of the 
25 evidence that the advertising is intended for the appropriate audience and not to appeal to 
26 persons under 21 years of age.  If a licensee is denied a certificate of approval, the licensee 
27 may appeal the decision administratively or to Superior Court.  If the department issues a 
28 notice to a licensee that an advertisement of the licensee is in violation of the laws and rules 
29 regarding adult use marijuana or marijuana product advertising, the licensee may appeal 
30 that decision to Superior Court and be allowed to operate without interference or license 
31 suspension while the appeal is pending.  If the court upholds the order of the department, 
32 the licensee has 15 days from the date of the decision to remedy the violation without any 
33 sanction, fine or penalty.  This bill also clarifies that advertising regulation may not 
34 unreasonably interfere with a licensee's rights under the First Amendment of the United 
35 States Constitution.1
