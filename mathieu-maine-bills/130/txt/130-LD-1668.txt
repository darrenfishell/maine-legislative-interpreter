Page 1 - 130LR1527(01)1Sec. 1.  Closure of Long Creek Youth Development Center.  Resolved:  That 
2 the Department of Corrections shall:
3 1.  Review and evaluate current state and national reports regarding the efficacy of the 
4 use of incarceration of youth in the State and nationally.  The department shall inform its 
5 work with information published and recommendations made to date around the efficacy 
6 of the youth prison model, conditions at the Long Creek Youth Development Center and 
7 the steps needed to successfully create a continuum of community-based alternatives for 
8 youth in the State involved in the juvenile justice system that improves outcomes for youth 
9 and public safety;
10 2.  Seek input from juvenile justice system stakeholders, including judges, defense 
11 attorneys, prosecutors, agency staff, residential and community-based service providers, 
12 youth advocates and youth and families affected by the juvenile justice system.  The 
13 department shall prioritize input from youth and families who have experienced the 
14 juvenile justice system and youth and families who have been harmed by the juvenile 
15 justice system;
16 3.  Develop a plan to close the Long Creek Youth Development Center by June 30, 
17 2023, divest the center's budget from the Department of Corrections and reinvest the funds 
18 from the center's budget into community-based support for youth and repurpose the facility 
19 for use as a community center with supportive housing.  This plan must include:
20 A.  Individual transition plans for remaining youth committed to the Long Creek Youth 
21 Development Center;
22 B.  A workforce development plan for Long Creek Youth Development Center staff 
23 developed in coordination with the Department of Labor;
24 C.  A process for establishing a community reinvestment fund; and
25 D.  Options for moving juvenile services out of the Department of Corrections and to 
26 another agency serving youth; and
27 4.  Develop recommendations for reinvestment of corrections funds currently 
28 designated for youth incarceration into a continuum of community-based alternatives.  The 
29 department shall conduct an analysis to determine the potential reinvestment of current 
30 youth incarceration funds into community-based programming focused on those 
31 communities most affected by youth incarceration, including a review of residential 
32 placement options to ensure those out-of-home placements are appropriate and demonstrate 
33 positive outcomes for youth.  The department shall review funding streams and costs to 
34 inform a reinvestment plan that ensures resources match the needs of youth and their 
35 communities and are not diverted to the adult justice system or used for other purposes.  
36 Current youth incarceration funds must be used for community-based integration services 
37 for youth that are not administered by the department.  These services include but are not 
38 limited to supportive housing, jobs programs, educational programs and health care, 
39 including mental health and substance use disorder treatment.  Compensation for these new 
40 positions to provide these services must be commensurate with the compensation 
41 employees earned while working at the Long Creek Youth Development Center.
42 The department may solicit data from public and private sources to inform its work, 
43 including but not limited to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department 
44 of Education and the Department of Labor.
Page 2 - 130LR1527(01)1Sec. 2.  Report.  Resolved:  That, no later than December 1, 2021, the Department 
2 of Corrections shall submit its plan to close the Long Creek Youth Development Center 
3 and a report that includes its findings and recommendations, including suggested 
4 legislation, to the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, which 
5 may report out legislation regarding the report to the Second Regular Session of the 130th 
6 Legislature.
7Sec. 3.  Selection of entity to manage and distribute funds.  Resolved:  That 
8 the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety shall study the 
9 selection of an entity to manage and distribute corrections funds currently designated for 
10 youth incarceration.  The entity must include:
11 1.  A formerly incarcerated person or an organization that represents formerly 
12 incarcerated persons;
13 2.  A representative of an organization that advocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
14 transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual community;
15 3.  A person with expertise in racial justice issues; and
16 4.  A person with expertise in mental and behavioral health treatment.
17 The entity may not be the Department of Corrections.  The Joint Standing Committee 
18 on Criminal Justice and Public Safety may report out legislation regarding its selection of 
19 an entity to the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature.
20SUMMARY
21 This resolve directs the Department of Corrections to create a plan to close the Long 
22 Creek Youth Development Center by June 30, 2023.  Current youth incarceration funds 
23 must be used for community-based integration services for youth that are not administered 
24 by the department.  These services include, but are not limited to, supportive housing, jobs 
25 programs, educational programs and health care, including mental health and substance use 
26 disorder treatment.  The plan created by the department must include individual transition 
27 plans for remaining youth committed to the Long Creek Youth Development Center; a 
28 workforce development plan for Long Creek Youth Development Center staff developed 
29 in coordination with the Department of Labor; a process for establishing a community 
30 reinvestment fund; and options for moving juvenile services out of the Department of 
31 Corrections and to another agency serving youth.
32 The resolve requires the current facility at the Long Creek Youth Development Center 
33 to be repurposed for use as a community center with supportive housing.
34 No later than December 1, 2021, the Department of Corrections must submit a report 
35 that includes its findings and recommendations, including suggested legislation, to the Joint 
36 Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, which may report out 
37 legislation regarding the report to the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature.
38 The Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety must study the 
39 selection of an entity to manage and distribute corrections funds currently designated for 
40 youth incarceration and may report out legislation regarding its selection of an entity to the 
41 Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature.21
