Page 7 - 130LR0043(01)46 the counteroffer, within 30 days of the date of receipt of the rejection the investor-
47 owned transmission and distribution utility may petition the Superior Court of

14 referees, who shall submit a recommended purchase price to the court; and
15 (3)  Render a decision and, based upon the recommended purchase price submitted 
16 under subparagraph (2) and any other information available to the court, order a 
17 purchase price to be paid by the company to the petitioner for possession and 
18 ownership of the subject utility facilities and utility property.

20 as in any civil action.
21 C.  The taking of utility facilities and utility property by the company is governed by 
22 this paragraph.
23 (1)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a petition is filed under paragraph 
24 B, the company may, after any appeals are resolved, take the subject utility 
25 facilities and utility property identified in paragraph A by eminent domain at the 
26 final price rendered by the court, in the same manner and under the same conditions 
27 as set forth in chapter 65. 
28 (2)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a petition is not filed under 
29 paragraph B, the company may take the subject utility facilities and utility property 
30 identified in paragraph A by eminent domain at the purchase price offer, in the 
31 same manner and under the same conditions as set forth in chapter 65.
32 Within 45 days of the date upon which the purchase price is either mutually agreed upon 
33 by the company and the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility or is finally

35 transmission and distribution utility shall prepare and submit any regulatory filings 
36 necessary to the transfer of subject utility facilities and utility property, including but not

41 the company, the commission shall, in a timely manner, investigate the utility's failure to 
42 prepare and submit the filings.  If the commission finds the investor-owned transmission 
43 and distribution utility unreasonably delayed or failed to prepare and submit the filings, or

35SUMMARY
36 This bill creates the Pine Tree Power Company, a privately operated, nonprofit, 
37 consumer-owned utility controlled by an elected board.  The company's purposes are to 
38 provide for its customer-owners in this State reliable, affordable electric transmission and 
39 distribution services and to help the State meet its climate, energy and connectivity goals 
40 in the most rapid and affordable manner possible.
41 The Pine Tree Power Company is not permitted to use general obligation bonds or tax 
42 dollars of the State.  The company finances itself by issuing debt against its future revenues 
43 to purchase the facilities of investor-owned electric transmission and distribution utilities 36

Page 13 - 130LR0043(01)44 in the State.  The fair market value of the acquisition is either negotiated or determined by 
45 a refereed process.  The Pine Tree Power Company Board contracts a nongovernmental 
46 team to operate the facilities, and the operations team is required to retain all workers of 
47 the purchased utilities.
5 The company is required to make payments equivalent to property taxes to 
6 municipalities.  The company is subject to ratemaking and other oversight by the Public 
7 Utilities Commission and is required to administer programs for net energy billing, 
8 nonwires alternatives, supply procurement and low-income assistance programs.
9 The company is governed by a board of 7 voting members, each elected to represent 5 
10 State Senate districts, as well as 4 expert advisory members.  The board is subject to 
11 freedom of access laws and to laws preventing conflicts of interest.
12 The bill also directs the Public Utilities Commission by January 1, 2024 to find a 
13 transmission and distribution utility unfit to serve and to direct the sale of the utility if 
14 within the previous 5 years the utility has been found to have been rated the lowest for 
15 customer satisfaction, has reported reliability in the lowest decile of utilities of a similar 
16 size in the country or has charged its customers residential delivery rates in the highest 
17 decile among utilities of a similar size in the country.
18 This bill requires that, before the Act becomes effective, the Act must be submitted to 
19 the legal voters of the State at a statewide election held in the month of November following 
20 passage of this Act in order to allow the legal voters of the State to vote on the creation of 
21 the Pine Tree Power Company.1
