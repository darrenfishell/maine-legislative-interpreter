44 the same as an animal that is currently inspected, and it includes amenable species under 
45 the laws governing voluntary inspections.  It removes the requirement that funds

47 human consumption be deposited in the General Fund as undedicated revenue.  It also 
48 prohibits a person from selling, transporting, offering for sale or transportation or receiving
