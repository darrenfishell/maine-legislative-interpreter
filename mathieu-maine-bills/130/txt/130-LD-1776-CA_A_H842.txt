Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment allows a pharmacist to dispense an 
emergency supply of a chronic maintenance drug to a patient without a prescription if the 
pharmacist is unable to obtain authorization to refill the prescription from a health care 
provider and the pharmacist has a record of the prescription in the name of the patient, 
including the amount of the drug dispensed in the most recent prescription or the standard 
unit of dispensing the drug, and that record does not indicate that no emergency supply is 
permitted. The amendment prohibits the dispensing of controlled substances included in 
Schedules I and II under the federal Controlled Substances Act. 
The amendment limits the amount dispensed to up to a 30-day supply or, if the standard 
unit of dispensing exceeds a 30-day supply, to the smallest standard unit of dispensing and 
further prohibits a pharmacist from dispensing the chronic maintenance drug in an 
emergency supply to the same patient more than twice in a 12-month period except that, if 
the drug is included on Schedule Ill or IV of the federal Controlled Substances Act, the 
amount dispensed may not exceed a 7-day supply. The amendment requires the pharmacist 
to make a professional judgment that the prescription is essential to sustain the life of the 
patient or to continue therapy for a chronic condition of the patient and that failure to 
dispense the drug could reasonably produce undesirable health consequences or cause 
physical or mental discomfort. 
The amendment adds a requirement that the pharmacist notify the practitioner who 
issued the prescription or another practitioner responsible for the patient's care no later than 
72 hours after the emergency supply is dispensed. 
The amendment requires health insurance plans to make available coverage for an 
emergency supply of a chronic maintenance drug dispensed in this manner. Any cost­
sharing requirement applicable to that chronic maintenance drug may be imposed by a 
health insurer on an emergency supply. 
The amendment removes the emergency preamble and emergency clause from the bill.
