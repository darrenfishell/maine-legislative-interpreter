The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $4,185,382 in 
fiscal year 2021-22 and $8,433,546 in fiscal year 2022-23 for the Department of Health and Human Services to 
amend its rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter ill, Section 67, Principles of Reimbursement for 
Nursing Facilities no later than January 1, 2022 to move health insurance costs for personnel from direct care and 
routine cost components to fixed costs components. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are also included for the 
FMAP match and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations for the Health Care Provider Tax, 
The Upper Payment Limit (UPL) analysis for Nursing Facilities (NF) indicates that currently the NF payments in 
MaineCare are lower than Medicare by $25 .1 million. The inclusion of Health Insurance as a fixed cost is estimated 
to increase the payments by $27.9 million. The impact of this change on the UPL will be limited by an increase to the 
Medicare rates to which the MaineCare rates are compared, but with this change the NF costs will likely go over the 
UPL threshold. However, based on the language in statute (Title 22 ยง1708 sub-ยง3, ,re) the DHHS must establish 
reimbursement rates that "are consistent with federal requirements relative to limits on reimbursement under the 
federal Social Security Act, Title XIX." Thus, the estimate of costs above includes all increases associated with the 
health insurance moving to fixed costs, with a federal match. If this does create a UPL issue, the DHHS will limit the 
pavments to NF's to remain below the federallv reauired limits.
