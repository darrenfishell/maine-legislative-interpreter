2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 363 and Public Law 2019, 
4 chapter 572 make a partial allocation of the state ceiling on private activity bonds to some 
5 issuers for calendar year 2021 but leave a portion of the state ceiling unallocated and do 
6 not provide sufficient allocations for certain types of private activity bonds that may require 
7 an allocation prior to the effective date of this Act if not enacted on an emergency basis; 
8 and
9Whereas, if these bond issues must be delayed due to the lack of available state

12 certain projects; and
