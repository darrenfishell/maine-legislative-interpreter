3ยง17768.  Service credit for teachers
4 A member who is a teacher and who experiences a reduction in income from an 
5 extracurricular or cocurricular position due to circumstances related to coronavirus disease 
6 2019, referred to in this section as "COVID-19," may purchase service credit for the period 
7 during which the extracurricular or cocurricular position was eliminated or otherwise 
8 unavailable under the following conditions. 
91.  Eligibility requirements.  A teacher may purchase service credit under this section 
10 only if: 
11 A.  During the 12 months preceding the start of the period of the service credit, the 
12 teacher received income from employment in an extracurricular or cocurricular 
13 position that was eliminated or otherwise unavailable during the period between 
14 January 1, 2020 to July 1, 2022 due to circumstances related to COVID-19; and
15 B.  The teacher is in the final 3 years of service during the period between January 1, 
16 2020 to July 1, 2022.
172.  Limit on service credit.  The additional service credit under this section may be 
18 purchased only for the period between January 1, 2020 to July 1, 2022. 
193.  Payment.  A member purchasing service credit under this section must, before any 
20 retirement benefit becomes effective, pay into the Members' Contribution Fund by a single 
21 payment or annual direct payments to the State Employee and Teacher Retirement Program 
22 an amount that, together with regular interest on that amount, is the actuarial equivalent, at 
23 the effective date of the retirement benefit, of the portion of the retirement benefit based on 
24 the additional service credit purchased under this section.  Payments must be made as 
25 provided in section 17701, subsection 4.
26 If any retirement benefit becomes effective before the completion of the payment under 
27 this subsection, the member is entitled to the additional creditable service that the total 
28 amount of payments actually made, plus regular interest on those payments to the date the 
29 retirement benefit becomes effective, bears to the actuarial equivalent of the total portion 
30 of the retirement benefit based on the additional creditable service.
314.  Limitation on use of purchased service credit.  Notwithstanding any provision of 
32 law to the contrary, service credit purchased under this section may be used only for the 
33 purpose of increasing the amount of a member's service retirement benefit by inclusion of 
34 the purchased service credit and may not be used to establish a member's qualification for 
35 a service retirement benefit.
