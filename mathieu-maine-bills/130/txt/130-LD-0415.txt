Page 1 - 130LR0959(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, due to extensive waiting lists for both children's services and adult services, 
4 targeted case management services are necessary to meet the essential health needs of 
5 people with disabilities; and
6Whereas, for more than 250 families on the waiting list for Section 29 services, 
7 targeted case management services are the only connection to essential support; and
8Whereas, the reimbursement rate for targeted case management services has not been 
9 adjusted since 2009 despite rising costs of wages, health insurance, technology and travel 
10 and other costs; and
11Whereas, case managers' duties and mandates have increased over the past decade 
12 including required activities that are unreimbursed; and
13Whereas, the State discontinued its own case management services in 2017 and 
14 increased the case load for targeted case management services delivered by community 
15 providers by more than 1,200 adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities; and
16Whereas, without an immediate increase in reimbursement to offset a decade of 
17 inflation, providers will be unable to maintain the capacity needed to ensure individuals 
18 with intellectual and developmental disabilities have access to targeted case management 
19 services; and
20Whereas, it is therefore essential that the Department of Health and Human Services 
21 amend its reimbursement rules to increase rates for targeted case management services no 
22 later than April 1, 2021; and
23Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
24 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
25 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
26 therefore, be it
27Sec. 1.  Department of Health and Human Services to amend rules. 
28Resolved:  That, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no later than April 
29 1, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services shall amend its rules in Chapter 
30 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 13, Targeted Case Management 
31 Services to increase reimbursement rates for targeted case management services by a 
32 percentage equivalent to the cumulative increase in costs measured by the United States 
33 Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index medical care 
34 services index in each year from 2010 to 2020.
35Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
36 takes effect when approved.
37SUMMARY
38 This resolve requires the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules 
39 governing MaineCare reimbursement for targeted case management services to provide an 
40 increase reflecting cost increases from 2010 to 2020.
