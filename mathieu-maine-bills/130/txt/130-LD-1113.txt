Page 1 - 130LR1705(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the study required by this resolve must be initiated before the 90-day period 
4 expires so that the Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous and Maine 
5 Tribal Populations can submit legislation to create equity in access to prenatal care in the 
6 State to the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature; and
7Whereas, the State has significant disparities in access to prenatal care: for example, 
8 90% of all women have a prenatal visit in the first trimester, while less than 75% of African-
9 American women have a visit in the first trimester; and 4% of all women have no visit until 
10 the last trimester as compared to 15% of African-American women; and
11Whereas, delayed access to prenatal care increases the risk of maternal morbidity and 
12 mortality and poor birth outcomes; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore, be it
17Sec. 1.  Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous and 
18Maine Tribal Populations to study and propose solutions to disparities in 
19access to prenatal care in the State.  Resolved:  That the Permanent Commission on 
20 the Status of Racial, Indigenous and Maine Tribal Populations, established under the Maine 
21 Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 12004-I, subsection 74-J and referred to in this resolve as 
22 "the commission," shall study the extent of disparities in access to prenatal care for the 
23 State's racial, indigenous and tribal populations through data and other information; study 
24 the causes of the disparities in access to prenatal care, including through interviews with 
25 those women who had no prenatal visit until the last trimester or had no prenatal care at all; 
26 and recommend solutions to disparities in access to prenatal care in the State.  The 
27 commission may submit legislation that serves to create equity in access to prenatal care in 
28 the State to the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature in accordance with Title 
29 5, section 25007, subsection 2, paragraph D.  Notwithstanding Title 5, section 12004-I, 
30 subsection 74-J, for their expenses incurred in the work of the commission pursuant to this 
31 section, members of the commission receive reimbursement pursuant to Title 5, section 
32 12002-A.
33Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
34 takes effect when approved.
