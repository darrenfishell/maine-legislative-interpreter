24 suspend the authorized term of imprisonment in whole or in part and accompany the 
25 suspension with a period of probation, which may not exceed the maximum period of 
26 probation authorized for the crime pursuant to section 1804, or a period of administrative 
27 release, which may not exceed one year.
282.  Probation presumed.  A sentencing alternative of probation is presumed to be the

16 on probation has inexcusably failed to comply with a requirement imposed as a condition 
17 of probation, it may revoke probation  impose a term of imprisonment of up to 60 days for 
18 the first violation considered by the court that does not constitute a crime and up to 120
