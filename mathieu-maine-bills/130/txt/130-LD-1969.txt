3 (1)  The commission shall initiate a first competitive solicitation and ensure that 
4 solicitation results in the approval of contracts by December 31, 2020 for energy 
5 or renewable energy credits equal to at least 7% of retail electricity sales for the 
6 period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, as determined by the 
7 commission. If the commission determines that contracts for an amount greater 
8 than 7% of retail electricity sales will provide financial benefits to ratepayers, it

31 (e)  Excise, income, property and sales taxes paid by the Class IA resource;
32 (f)  Purchases of goods and services by the Class IA resource; and
33 (g)  Avoided emissions resulting from the operation of the Class IA resource. ;
34 (h)  For an assisted project, with respect to additional requests for bids or 
35 proposals initiated by the commission pursuant to this section for energy or 
36 renewable energy credits after January 1, 2023, including bids or proposals 
37 that supplement a process started on or before January 1, 2023, whether the 
38 Class IA resource has entered into a project labor agreement with a labor 
39 organization to supply construction workers in all crafts needed for the assisted 
40 project where the assisted project is located. For purposes of this division, a 
41 project labor agreement must contain provisions that:1
2
Page 7 - 130LR2473(01)1 (i)  Bind all contractors and subcontractors on the assisted project to the 
2 project labor agreement through the inclusion of appropriate specifications 
3 in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;

5 subcontracts on the assisted project without regard to whether they are 
6 otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements;
7 (iii)  Establish uniform terms and conditions of employment for all 
8 construction craft workers employed on the assisted project;
9 (iv)  Contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts and similar job 
10 disruptions; and
11 (v)  Set forth effective, prompt and mutually binding procedures for 
12 resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor 
13 agreement; and
14 (i)  For an assisted project, whether a majority of the individuals working on 
15 the assisted project are members of an entity that is employee-owned, 
16 including but not limited to an entity that offers employee stock ownership 
17 plans.
18 For the purposes of this subparagraph, "labor organization" means an organization 
19 that is not a company union and that is constituted for the purpose, in whole or in 
20 part, of engaging in collective bargaining, dealing with employers concerning 
21 employee grievances or terms or conditions of employment or providing other 
22 employee aid or protection. "Labor organization" includes, but is not limited to, a 
23 bona fide labor organization that is certified or recognized as the organization of 
24 jurisdiction representing the relevant workers and a bona fide building and 
25 construction trades council or district council or state or local labor federation 
26 composed of local unions certified or recognized as the representative of the 
27 relevant workers.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, "assisted project" has the 
28 same meaning as in Title 26, section 3701, subsection 1, paragraph B.
29 D.  The commission shall, in accordance with this paragraph, allow energy storage 
30 systems to participate in solicitations or be awarded contracts under this section.
31 (1)  The commission shall permit an energy storage system to bid on solicitations 
32 or to be contracted under this section only if the energy storage system is connected 
33 to the State's electricity grid, paired as a complementary resource with a Class IA 
34 resource and either:
35 (a)  Colocated with the Class IA resource, whether metered jointly with or 
36 separately from the Class IA resource; or
37 (b)  Located at a different location from the Class IA resource and the 
38 commission finds that inclusion of the energy storage system would result in a 
39 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
40 (2)  A bid under this section that includes an energy storage system must include 2 
41 separate bid proposals, one with the energy storage system and one without.   The 
42 commission shall assess the bid proposals based on the benefits to ratepayers, 
43 which may include, but are not limited to:
Page 8 - 130LR2473(01)1 (a)  Reduction in costs;
2 (b)  Decrease in peak electricity demand;
3 (c)  Deferral of investments in the transmission and distribution system;
4 (d)  Deferral of capital investments in new generating capacity;
5 (e)  Increase in the electricity grid's overall flexibility, reliability and resiliency; 
6 and
7 (f)  Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
8 (3)  An energy storage system that is not colocated with a Class IA resource may 
9 receive renewable energy credits only for stored energy generated from a Class IA 
10 resource.
11 (4)  If chosen for a contract under this section, an energy storage system must 
12 remain stationary and under the same ownership throughout the contract term.
13 (5)  The commission may permit an energy storage system to be paired with and 
14 added to a Class IA resource after that resource has been awarded a contract.
15 For the purposes of this paragraph, "energy storage system" means a commercially 
16 available technology that uses mechanical, chemical or thermal processes for absorbing 
17 energy and storing it for a period of time for use at a later time.
18SUMMARY
19 This bill does the following.
20 1. It requires projects involving the construction of renewable energy generating 
21 systems that are at least 2 megawatts in size and that receive at least $50,000 in state 
22 assistance to meet certain workforce requirements. It defines such projects as "assisted 
23 projects." Specifically, contractors and subcontractors working on an assisted project are 
24 required to pay construction workers at least the prevailing rate for wages and benefits, 
25 except that they may pay the apprentice rate to apprentices on the project if those 
26 apprentices are participants in a registered apprenticeship program that is regularly 
27 graduating apprentices to journeyman status and the apprentices on the assisted project are 
28 graduates of a program that has a facilitated entry agreement with an approved 
29 preapprenticeship training program. This requirement does not apply, however, if the entity 
30 responsible for the project has ensured that the entity directly responsible for the 
31 construction of the project has entered into a project labor agreement that meets certain 
32 requirements. 
33 2. It provides that if after January 1, 2023 the Public Utilities Commission engages in 
34 additional procurement of energy or renewable energy credits pursuant to the Maine 
35 Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3210-G, the commission, in determining benefits to 
36 the State's economy, is required to consider whether the Class IA resource has secured a 
37 project labor agreement with a labor organization to supply construction workers in all 
38 crafts needed for the assisted project where the assisted project is located.
39 3. It directs the Public Utilities Commission, in conducting a solicitation and selecting 
40 Class IA resources for contracts pursuant to statutory provisions governing renewable 
41 portfolio standard procurement, to consider whether a majority of the individuals working 19
Page 9 - 130LR2473(01)42 on an assisted project are members of an entity that is employee-owned, including but not 
43 limited to an entity that offers employee stock ownership plans.
3 4. It sets standards for approval and evaluation of preapprenticeship training programs 
4 by the Maine Apprenticeship Program, as well as minimum curriculum requirements. The 
5 bill defines a preapprenticeship training program as a program designed to prepare 
6 individuals to enter into and succeed in a registered apprenticeship program.  The bill 
7 focuses on equity, inclusion and access to preapprenticeship training programs, requiring 
8 them to provide certain services to ensure participation by individuals from disadvantaged 
9 communities and implement affirmative action programs. It requires the payment of a 
10 stipend to participants that is at least equivalent to the state minimum wage and prioritizes 
11 state grants to those program sponsors that provide services that reduce barriers to entry for 
12 historically underrepresented groups and that demonstrate that a significant number of their 
13 participants subsequently enrolled in registered apprenticeship programs.
14 The bill also corrects a conflict created by Public Law 2021, chapter 390 and Revisor's 
15 Report 2021, chapter 1, which affected the same provision of law, by reallocating the 
16 provision reallocated by Revisor's Report 2021, chapter 1.1
