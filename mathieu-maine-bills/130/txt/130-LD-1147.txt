Page 1 - 130LR1130(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day 
4 period because MaineCare reimbursement rates for providing medication management 
5 services are stagnant and are insufficient to enable some providers to continue to provide 
6 services; and
7Whereas, the parameters and requirements for medication management must be 
8 reformed immediately in order to reflect the increased complexity of the demand and to 
9 sustain the availability and effectiveness of these services by providing resources and 
10 adjusting criteria; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore, be it
15Sec. 1.  Department of Health and Human Services to increase MaineCare 
16reimbursement for adults with serious mental illness.  Resolved:  That the 
17 Department of Health and Human Services shall amend its rule Chapter 101:  MaineCare 
18 Benefits Manual, Chapters II and III, Section 65, Behavioral Health Services, to increase 
19 reimbursement rates for medication management services by 25% and to respond to the 
20 increased demand and complexity of the need for medication management services and 
21 make the following changes: 
22 1.  Provide for new rates consistent with the 25% rate increase and for subsequent 
23 adjustments to ensure that adequate resources continue to be available;
24 2.  With stakeholder input, develop a per member, per month reimbursement rate 
25 method that covers the cost for all services provided; and
26 3.  With stakeholder input, create 3 levels of care and reimbursement to meet the 
27 diverse needs of those receiving these services:
28 A.  Level 3:  An enhanced rate for any client involved in a progressive treatment plan, 
29 or recently released from inpatient psychiatric treatment, or forensic services at a state-
30 run hospital;
31 B.  Level 2:  A standard rate for care that accounts for regular monitoring and updating 
32 as needed to achieve stabilization; and
33 C.  Level 1:  A lower maintenance rate for those that have achieved a very stable, 
34 consistent response and adherence to their regimen.
35 Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined in the 
36 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
37Sec. 2.  Appropriations and allocations.  Resolved:  That the following 
38 appropriations and allocations are made.
