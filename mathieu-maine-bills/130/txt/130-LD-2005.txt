Page 1 - 130LR2612(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 757 requires the Knox 
4 County Commissioners to prepare a redistricting plan for Knox County budget committee 
5 seats by June 1, 2021 and submit that plan to the Secretary of State; and
6Whereas, upon receipt of the redistricting plan, the Secretary of State is required to 
7 submit the plan to the Legislature for "review and enactment"; and
8Whereas, although the Knox County Commissioners determined that no changes in 
9 the budget committee districts were necessary, this legislation is needed to provide clarity 
10 in time for the elections of budget committee members this year; and 
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA ยง757, sub-ยง1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 481, ยง1, is further 
17 amended to read:
181.  Redistricting process.  The county commissioners shall review the districts 
19 established in subsection 2 and, if changes are necessary, prepare a redistricting plan for 
20 county budget committee seats by June 1, 2021 2031 and every 10 years thereafter.  The 
21 county commissioners shall submit the any redistricting plan to the Secretary of State 
22 within 5 days of adoption.  The If redistricting is required, the Secretary of State shall 
23 immediately transmit the redistricting plan to the Legislature for review and enactment.
24Sec. 2. Knox County budget committee districts.  Notwithstanding that 
25 provision of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 757, subsection 1 that requires 
26 a redistricting plan to be prepared in 2021 by the Knox County Commissioners and 
27 reviewed and enacted by the Legislature, the Knox County budget committee districts 
28 specified in Title 30-A, section 757, subsection 2 remain the same until a redistricting plan 
29 is submitted to the Secretary of State by the Knox County Commissioners in 2031 or later 
30 and that plan is subsequently reviewed and enacted by the Legislature. 
31Sec. 3.  Application. This Act is not intended to affect the terms of the Knox County 
32 budget committee members in office on the effective date of this Act.
33Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
34 takes effect when approved.
35SUMMARY
36 Under current law, beginning in June 2021, the Knox County Commissioners are 
37 required to prepare a redistricting plan for the Knox County budget committee districts and 
38 submit that plan to the Secretary of State, who is required to submit it to the Legislature for 
39 review and enactment.  In 2021, the Knox County Commissioners determined that the 
40 budget committee districts in place did not need to be adjusted, so no new plan for 
41 redistricting was capable of being enacted by the Legislature, as required by the law.36

Page 2 - 130LR2612(01)1 To overcome this issue and avoid it in the future, this bill:
2 1. Allows the Knox County Commissioners, beginning in June 2031, to determine 
3 whether changes to the budget committee districts are needed and, only if changes are 
4 necessary, submit a redistricting plan to the Secretary of State, who must submit the plan 
5 to the Legislature for review and enactment; and
6 2.  Declares that, for purposes of the 2021 redistricting of the Knox County budget 
7 committee districts, the districts established currently in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
8 30-A, section 757, subsection 2 remain the districts until the Knox County Commissioners 
9 submit a redistricting plan to the Secretary of State and that plan is subsequently reviewed 
10 and enacted by the Legislature.  This bill also explicitly states that it is not intended to affect 
11 the terms of the budget committee members in office on the effective date of the legislation.
