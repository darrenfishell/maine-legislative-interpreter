14Sec. 3.  1 MRSA §403-B, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 290, §1, is amended to 
15 read:
164.  Application.  This section applies to a board or committee under the jurisdiction of 
17 a public body that has adopted a written policy pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph A.  This 
18 section does not apply to:
19 A.  The Legislature; or
20 B.  A public body to which specific statutory provisions for remote participation apply.
21SUMMARY
22 This bill amends the law governing remote participation in public meetings in the 
23 Freedom of Access Act to remove the requirement that a remote meeting policy adopted 
24 by a public body must include an expectation that members of the public body be physically 
25 present.  It allows the public body to limit public attendance at a proceeding solely to 
26 remote methods if there is an emergency or urgent situation that requires the public body 
27 to meet only by remote methods.  It also provides that the law governing remote 
28 participation in public meetings applies to a board or committee within the jurisdiction of 
29 a public body adopting a written remote meeting policy.22
