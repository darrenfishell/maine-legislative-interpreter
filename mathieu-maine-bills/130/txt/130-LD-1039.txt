Page 1 - 130LR1075(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  37-B MRSA §742, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
34.  Legislative processes.  During a state of emergency under this chapter, the 
4 Legislature may vote on a proclamation or executive order made under the state of 
5 emergency remotely by electronic or other means as established by the rules of each House 
6 of the Legislature, as specified by the presiding officer of each House.
7Sec. 2.  37-B MRSA §743, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1983, c. 594, §34, is amended 
8 to read:
92.  Limitation.  No A state of emergency may not continue for longer than 30 days 
10 unless renewed by the Governor  Legislature by majority vote of each House upon request 
11 by the Governor for up to 30 additional days. The renewal process may be repeated 
12 indefinitely in up to 30-day increments. If the Legislature is not in session at the time the 
13 request is issued by the Governor, the Governor shall provide at least 3 days' notice to the 
14 leader of the party with the most members and the leader of the party with the 2nd-most 
15 members in each House of the Legislature to immediately convene the Legislature to 
16 consider the Governor's request. If the state of emergency is terminated for any reason, the 
17 Governor may not declare another state of emergency for the same emergency or set of 
18 circumstances underlying the initial state of emergency.  The Legislature, by joint 
19 resolution, may terminate a state of emergency at anytime  any time.  Thereupon, the 
20 Governor shall issue an executive proclamation ending the state of emergency.  The 
21 Legislature may terminate any specific emergency order of the Governor with respect to a 
22 state of emergency by a 2/3 vote of each House. This subsection does not apply to the 
23 Governor's powers under chapter 3.
24SUMMARY
25 This bill amends the provisions of law regarding the termination of a state of 
26 emergency by removing the Governor's authority to renew a state of emergency after 30 
27 days and instead providing that the renewal of a state of emergency must be approved by a 
28 majority vote of each House of the Legislature upon request by the Governor.  The state of 
29 emergency may be renewed for up to 30 days at a time, and the renewal process may be 
30 repeated indefinitely.  If the Legislature is out of session at the time the request is issued 
31 by the Governor, the Governor must give at least 3 days' notice to the Legislature for the 
32 Legislature to convene to consider the request.  If the state of emergency is terminated for 
33 any reason, the Governor may not declare another state of emergency for the same 
34 emergency or set of circumstances underlying the first state of emergency. The Governor's 
35 powers as Commander in Chief of the military forces of the State are not affected by this 
36 bill. The bill authorizes the Legislature to terminate any specific emergency order by the 
37 Governor by a 2/3 vote in each House of the Legislature. This bill also allows the 
38 Legislature during a state of emergency to vote on a proclamation or executive order made 
39 during that emergency remotely by electronic or other means.25
