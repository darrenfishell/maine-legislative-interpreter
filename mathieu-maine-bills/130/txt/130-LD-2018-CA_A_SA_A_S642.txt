This amendment removes the appropriations to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for 4 positions, 
associated costs and community engagement efforts. As amended, the bill retains provisions regarding the Public 
Utilities Commission intervenor funding and definitions for "environmental justice," "frontline communities," and 
associated terminology. This bill provides no new funding to the DEP for the community engagement activities as 
directed in the bill. The impact of these new unfunded costs on other programs in the DEP cannot be determined at 
this time.
