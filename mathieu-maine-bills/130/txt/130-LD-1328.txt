Page 1 - 130LR1924(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง717 is enacted to read:
3ยง717.  Winter terminations
41.  Definition.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A.  "Disconnection prohibition period" means any time between November 15th and 
7 April 15th, or during any other period when, pursuant to rules adopted under section 
8 704, the commission has prohibited a transmission and distribution utility from 
9 disconnecting residential customers or prohibited such disconnections without the 
10 permission from the consumer assistance and safety division.
11 B.  "Residential customer" includes any customer account to which electric service is 
12 provided for residential purposes, regardless of whether the electricity received under 
13 that account is also used for business purposes.
142.  Notice of winter disconnection.  During a disconnection prohibition period, a 
15 transmission and distribution utility may not send or deliver, orally, on paper or 
16 electronically, to any residential customer of the utility any notice or communication that:
17 A. Provides for disconnection of the customer's electric service on a specified date or 
18 within a specified interval of time during a disconnection prohibition period, unless the 
19 utility has received the prior permission of the consumer assistance and safety division 
20 to make the disconnection on the specified date or within the specified interval of time; 
21 or
22 B.  Makes any reference to disconnection or involuntary termination of the customer's 
23 electric service during a disconnection prohibition period, unless the notice or 
24 communication includes a prominent statement that disconnection of a residential 
25 customer's electric service during the disconnection prohibition period cannot take 
26 place without the advance permission of the consumer assistance and safety division, 
27 that the customer will be notified of any request for such permission and that the 
28 customer will have the opportunity to be heard by the consumer assistance and safety 
29 division.
303.  Past due accounts; assistance programs.  Notwithstanding any provision of law 
31 to the contrary, a notice to a residential customer from a transmission and distribution utility 
32 of a past due account that if not paid could lead to termination of utility service after April 
33 15th is sufficient evidence to establish eligibility for emergency general assistance as 
34 described in Title 22, chapter 1161 and for fuel assistance as described in Title 30-A, 
35 chapter 201, subchapter 13.
364.  Violation; penalties.  A transmission and distribution utility that violates this 
37 section is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500, payable to the customer to whom 
38 the prohibited communication is sent.  This penalty is recoverable in a civil action and is 
39 in addition to any other remedies to which the customer may be entitled.
40SUMMARY
41 This bill prohibits the use by an electric transmission and distribution utility of a notice 
42 or communication to a residential customer in the winter months that threatens 41
42
Page 2 - 130LR1924(01)43 disconnection on a specified date or within a specified time period unless the utility already 
44 has permission for the disconnection from the consumer assistance and safety division 
45 within the Public Utilities Commission.  It also requires that any notice that in any way 
46 mentions disconnection during the winter months also state prominently that disconnection 
47 cannot take place without the advance permission of the consumer assistance and safety 
48 division and that the customer will be notified and heard.  A violation of these requirements 
49 subjects the utility to a penalty of up to $2,500 per violation payable to the affected 
50 customer, in addition to any other remedies to which the customer may be legally entitled.1
