Page 1 - 130LR0905(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง2610-A is enacted to read:
3ยง2610-A.  Testing, reporting and treatment of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
4substances in drinking water
51.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
6 following terms have the following meanings.
7 A.  "Action level for PFAS" means:
8 (1)  For regulated PFAS contaminants, 20 nanograms per liter or the maximum 
9 contaminant levels adopted by the department by rule pursuant to subsection 5, 
10 paragraph A, either individually for any one of the regulated PFAS contaminants 
11 or as the sum concentration of 2 or more of the regulated PFAS contaminants; or
12 (2)  For PFAS that are not regulated PFAS contaminants and for which the 
13 department has adopted a maximum contaminant level by rule pursuant to 
14 subsection 5, paragraph B, the maximum contaminant level for that PFAS. 
15 B.  "Community water system" has the same meaning as in section 2660-B, subsection 
16 2.
17 C.  "Noncommunity water system" has the same meaning as in section 2660-B, 
18 subsection 5.
19 D.  "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances" or "PFAS" means any member of 
20 the class of fluorinated organic chemicals containing at least one fully fluorinated 
21 carbon atom.
22 E. "Regulated PFAS contaminants" means perfluorooctanoic acid, 
23 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, 
24 perfluoroheptanoic acid and perfluorodecanoic acid.
252.  Testing for PFAS.  On or before December 31, 2022, each community water system 
26 and noncommunity water system shall send samples of water provided by its system to an 
27 approved laboratory under section 2607 to be tested using the drinking water laboratory 
28 methods for PFAS developed and published by the United States Environmental Protection 
29 Agency for all PFAS analytes that can be effectively measured using those methods at the 
30 time the samples were taken.
31 A.  If testing under this subsection detects the presence of regulated PFAS 
32 contaminants at a level equivalent to or in excess of the action level for PFAS, the 
33 community water system or noncommunity water system shall:
34 (1) Report such test results in accordance with subsection 3;
35 (2) Notify all potential users of water provided by the system of the detected 
36 regulated PFAS contaminants and the potential risk to public health associated with 
37 the consumption of water provided by the system until properly treated;
38 (3) Implement treatment measures in accordance with subsection 4 to treat the 
39 water provided by the system; and
40 (4) Continue to test samples of the system's water pursuant to this subsection on a 
41 quarterly basis, except when a different testing frequency is specified by the 
Page 2 - 130LR0905(01)42 department by rule adopted pursuant to subsection 5, paragraph C, until testing 
43 does not detect the presence of regulated PFAS contaminants at a level equivalent 
44 to or in excess of the action level for PFAS, after which testing must continue 
45 pursuant to paragraph B. 
5 B.  If testing under this subsection does not detect the presence of regulated PFAS 
6 contaminants at a level equivalent to or in excess of the action level for PFAS, the 
7 community water system or noncommunity water system shall continue to test samples 
8 of water pursuant to this subsection on an annual basis except when a different testing 
9 frequency is specified by the department by rule adopted pursuant to subsection 5, 
10 paragraph C.
113.  Reporting of test results.  A community water system or noncommunity water 
12 system that conducts testing pursuant to subsection 2 shall submit to the department the 
13 results of such testing.  A community water system shall ensure that the results of testing 
14 conducted pursuant to subsection 2 are included in the annual consumer confidence reports 
15 required under section 2615-A, subsection 1.
164.  Treatment.  If testing under subsection 2 detects the presence of regulated PFAS 
17 contaminants at a level equivalent to or in excess of the action level for PFAS, the 
18 community water system or noncommunity water system shall implement necessary 
19 treatment measures as directed by the department to reduce the level of regulated PFAS 
20 contaminants below the action level for PFAS.
215.  Enforcement; rules.  The department shall administer and enforce this section and 
22 shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section.  Rules adopted pursuant to this 
23 section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
24 A.  The department may adopt rules establishing maximum contaminant levels for 
25 regulated PFAS contaminants as long as such adopted maximum contaminant levels 
26 are not more than 20 nanograms per liter, both individually for each regulated PFAS 
27 contaminant and as the sum concentration of 2 or more of the regulated PFAS 
28 contaminants.  If the department adopts rules establishing maximum contaminant 
29 levels for regulated PFAS contaminants, the testing for, reporting on and treatment 
30 measures for regulated PFAS contaminants under subsections 2 to 4 must be conducted 
31 based on the maximum contaminant levels for regulated PFAS contaminants as 
32 established by the department by rule pursuant to this subsection. 
33 B.  The department may adopt rules requiring community water systems and 
34 noncommunity water systems under this section to test for, report on and implement 
35 treatment measures for PFAS that are not regulated PFAS contaminants and may adopt 
36 rules establishing maximum contaminant levels for such PFAS.  If the department 
37 adopts rules under this subsection establishing maximum contaminant levels for PFAS 
38 that are not regulated PFAS contaminants, the department shall require testing for, 
39 reporting on and treatment measures for such PFAS under subsections 2 to 4 to be 
40 conducted based on those adopted maximum contaminant levels. 
41 C.  The department may adopt rules regarding the frequency with which community 
42 water systems and noncommunity water systems are required to test for regulated 
43 PFAS contaminants and for PFAS that are not regulated PFAS contaminants for which 
44 testing has been required by rule pursuant to paragraph B.  In adopting rules pursuant 
45 to this paragraph, the department shall account for the number of individuals served by 1

Page 3 - 130LR0905(01)46 a community water system or noncommunity water system and for the type of PFAS 
47 identified through prior testing.  The rules must at a minimum require:
3 (1) At least quarterly testing of community water systems and noncommunity 
4 water systems when prior testing has detected the presence of regulated PFAS 
5 contaminants or PFAS that are not regulated PFAS contaminants at a level 
6 equivalent to or in excess of the action level for PFAS; and
7 (2) Testing at least once every 3 years of community water or noncommunity water 
8 systems where prior testing has detected the presence of regulated PFAS 
9 contaminants or PFAS that are not regulated PFAS contaminants at a level less 
10 than the action level for PFAS.  
11SUMMARY
12 This bill requires each community water system and noncommunity water system to 
13 send samples of water provided by its system to an approved laboratory to be tested for 
14 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, on or before December 31, 2022.  
15 If such testing detects the presence of certain PFAS at a level equivalent to or in excess of 
16 20 nanograms per liter, the community water system or noncommunity water system is 
17 required to implement necessary treatment measures directed by the Department of Health 
18 and Human Services to reduce the levels of those PFAS contaminants below the 20 
19 nanograms per liter threshold.  
20 The department is required to administer and enforce these requirements and to adopt 
21 implementing rules, which may include rules establishing maximum contaminant levels 
22 for PFAS contaminants.1
