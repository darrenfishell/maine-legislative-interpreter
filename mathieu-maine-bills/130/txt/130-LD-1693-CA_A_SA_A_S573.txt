Reduces rulemaking requirements 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Removing the requirement that the Department of Education adopt rules to revise its school nutrition and physical 
activity standards to increase obesity prevention in public schools will reduce the costs to the department associat 
with the rulemaking process. As amended, the department, along with the Department of Health and Human Services, 
will still need to adopt rules to revise their nutrition, physical activity, screen time and sugary drink standards to 
increase obesity prevention in early care and education.
