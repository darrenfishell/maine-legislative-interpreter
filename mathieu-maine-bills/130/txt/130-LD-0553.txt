4CHAPTER 47
5EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION
6§3701.  Definitions
7 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
8 have the following meanings.
91.  Cause.  "Cause" means a reasonable basis related to an employee for termination 
10 of the employee's employment in view of relevant factors and circumstances, which may 
11 include the employee's conduct on the job or violation of the employer's policies governing 
12 employment.
132.  Employee.  "Employee" means an individual who works for hire, including an 
14 individual employed in a supervisory, managerial or confidential position, but not an 
15 independent contractor.
163.  Employer.  "Employer" means a person that has employed 5 or more employees 
17 for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the 2-year period next 
18 preceding a termination excluding a parent, spouse, child or other member of the 
19 employer's immediate family or of the immediate family of an individual having a 
20 controlling interest in the employer.
21§3702.  Termination for cause
22 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an employer may not terminate 
23 the employment of an employee without cause.  An employer may terminate an employee 
24 for cause only if the employer has followed a progressive discipline policy in accordance 
25 with section 3703, except that if an employee has violated any state law an employer is not 
26 required to follow a progressive discipline policy and may proceed to immediate 
27 termination with notice as required under section 3703, subsection 2.
28§3703.  Progressive discipline policy and termination
29 Except as provided in section 3702, an employer shall apply a progressive discipline 
30 policy and provide notice of termination in accordance with this section.
311. Progressive discipline policy. An employer shall adopt and implement a 
32 progressive discipline policy for its employees.  If an employer has not adopted a 
33 progressive discipline policy, the employer must implement the model progressive 
34 discipline policy provided by the department under section 3704. A progressive discipline 
35 policy adopted by an employer must:
36 A. Include a 3-step disciplinary process prior to termination, including a verbal warning 
37 as step one, a written warning as step 2 and a final written warning as step 3;
Page 2 - 130LR1940(01)1 B. Provide that each warning, whether verbal or written, must be accompanied by 
2 written documentation of the specific basis for the warning, which may include, but is 
3 not limited to, the employee's conduct on the job or a violation of the employer's 
4 policies;  
5 C. Include language in the final written warning stating that any further instance of the 
6 employee conduct or violation of policy identified in documentation required under 
7 paragraph B will lead to the immediate termination of the employee's employment; 
8 D. Require the employee to sign a copy of the final written warning; and
9 E. Provide that the failure of the employee to sign the final written warning is 
10 considered a violation of the employer's progressive discipline policy. 
112. Notice of termination.  An employer shall provide a written notice of termination 
12 to inform an employee that the employee is being terminated from employment. The 
13 written notice must include, but is not limited to, an explanation of the cause or causes for 
14 termination and the effective date of the termination of employment.  A copy of the written 
15 notice of termination must be mailed to the employee on the date it is signed by the 
16 employer.
17§3704.  Model progressive discipline policy and forms
18 The department shall develop and make available to employers a model progressive 
19 discipline policy in accordance with the requirements of section 3703 and model forms for 
20 use at each step in the discipline process including termination.  The model progressive 
21 discipline policy must include guidance for employers and employees at each step of the 
22 progressive discipline process, as outlined in section 3703, subsection 1, and for 
23 termination.  Model forms must include space to document the cause for the discipline and 
24 proof of cause for termination. The model progressive discipline policy and model forms 
25 must be available on the department's publicly accessible website.
26§3705.  Private right of action
271. Limit on private right of action. An employee has no private right of action under 
28 this chapter, except that an employee may bring a private right of action if the employee 
29 was terminated and the employer violated the employer's progressive discipline policy or, 
30 if the employer has not adopted such a policy, the model progressive discipline policy 
31 provided by the department under section 3704, with that employee.  In a private right of 
32 action authorized under this section, an employee must prove that a substantive violation 
33 of the employer or model progressive discipline policy occurred with respect to the 
34 employee. An employee who is aggrieved by an employer's violation of the progressive 
35 discipline policy may appeal to the director, who may conduct a nonbinding review to 
36 determine whether there has been a violation of the policy by the employer, or the employee 
37 may bring a civil action in court against the employer.
382. Construction. Except as specifically provided in this section, this chapter provides 
39 no express or implied private right of action.
