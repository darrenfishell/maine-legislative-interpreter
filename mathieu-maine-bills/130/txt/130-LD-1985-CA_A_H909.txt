This amendment does the following. 
1. It changes the emergency preamble. 
2. It allows adult use marijuana and adult use marijuana products to be transferred 
between licensees without requiring mandatory testing.

use marijuana or adult use marijuana products may be sold or transferred to a consumer. 
4. It requires additional testing of previously tested adult use marijuana or adult use 
marijuana products prior to sale or transfer to a consumer only if the marijuana or marijuana 
product has undergone further processing, manufacturing or alteration since the previous 
testing that would result in an increase in the concentration of any contaminants or factors 
that are required to be assessed as part of the testing.
