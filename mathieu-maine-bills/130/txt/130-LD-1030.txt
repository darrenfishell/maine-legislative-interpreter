8 counsel.
92.  Petition Grounds for petition.  The petitioner may file a petition with the District 
10 Court that requests the termination of the parental rights and responsibilities of the parent 
11 and alleges following allegations, if proven, are sufficient grounds to terminate a parent's 
12 parental rights and responsibilities under this section:
13 A.  That the The parent was convicted of a crime involving sexual assault, as defined 
14 in Title 17‑A, section 253, 254 or 556, or a comparable crime in another jurisdiction, 
15 that resulted in the conception of the child; or

22 of the right and responsibility for support, without reserving for the parent any rights 
23 to make decisions, to have access to records or to have contact with the child, and 
24 termination of the parent's parental rights and responsibilities is necessary to protect 
25 the child from serious harm or the threat of serious harm.
262-A.  Procedure on petition to terminate parental rights and responsibilities.  Once 
27 a petition to terminate parental rights and responsibilities is filed, the following procedure 
28 applies.
29 A.  The court shall appoint an attorney for a parent who is the subject of a petition to 
30 terminate parental rights and responsibilities under this section and who is indigent.  In 
31 a contested action, the court may also appoint counsel for any indigent petitioner who 
32 files a petition under this section when the parent who is the subject of the petition is 
33 represented by counsel.
34 B.  The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the child if the petition to terminate 
35 parental rights and responsibilities is brought under subsection 2, paragraph C.  The 
36 appointment may be made at any time, but the court shall make every effort to make

46 in subsection 3-A and any other applicable provisions of this section.
4 F.  The federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States Code, Title 25, Section 
5 1901 et seq., governs all proceedings under this section that pertain to an Indian child

11 terminate the parental rights and responsibilities of the parent.  
123-A.  Termination.  The court:
13 A.  Shall order termination of the parent's parental rights and responsibilities if the

16 in subsection 4 applies; or
17 B.  May order termination of the parent's parental rights and responsibilities if the court

20 (2)  That the petitioner has proven the allegations in subsection 2, paragraph C and, 
21 if so, that the termination is also in the best interest of the child.  Evidence that 
22 termination is necessary to protect the child from harm or threat of serious harm 
23 may include, but is not limited to, proof of:
24 (a)  The parent's conduct demonstrating an intent to permanently forgo all 
25 parental duties or relinquish parental claims regarding the child; or
26 (b)  The parent's acts of abuse, as defined in section 4002, subsection 1, upon 
27 the petitioner or a minor child in the parent's or petitioner's household.
28 Except as provided in this section or in Title 18-C, section 9-204, a court may not terminate 
29 the parental rights and responsibilities of a parent on a petition filed by another parent or 
30 the parent or guardian of a child's minor parent.
314.  Exception.  The court is not required to terminate the parental rights and 
32 responsibilities of a parent convicted of gross sexual assault under Title 17‑A, section 253,

22SUMMARY
23 This legislation is proposed by the Family Law Advisory Commission pursuant to the 
24 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 19-A, section 354, subsection 2.
25 This bill expands courts' authority to protect children when a parent has been awarded 
26 sole parental rights and responsibilities in 2 ways.  First, it amends the Maine Uniform 
27 Probate Code to ensure the court has authority to appoint a guardian for a minor upon the 
28 death of the parent who was awarded exclusive parental rights and responsibilities.  Second, 
29 it provides a process to allow, in very limited situations, one parent to file a petition to 
30 terminate another parent's parental rights and responsibilities outside of an adoption 
31 proceeding.
32 The Maine Uniform Probate Code currently allows a court to appoint a guardian for a 
33 minor when the court finds the appointment is in the best interest of the minor and the court 
34 finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parents are unwilling or unable to exercise 
35 their parental rights and responsibilities.  The law provides 2 examples of situations in 
36 which the parents are unable or unwilling to exercise their parental rights and 
37 responsibilities.  The bill adds a 3rd example:  when the parent to whom a court has awarded 
38 exclusive parental rights and responsibilities dies and the court finds by clear and 
39 convincing evidence that there is neither a substantial change in circumstances between the 
40 time of the order and the parent's death nor other facts that would render a finding based 
41 on the order to be inequitable or unjust.  Current law provides that when one parent dies, 
42 all parental rights and responsibilities pertaining to a child devolve upon the surviving 23
24
Page 6 - 130LR0257(01)43 parent.  The bill allows a court to appoint a guardian if the deceased parent had been 
44 awarded exclusive parental rights and responsibilities, with the now-surviving parent 
45 having been given no rights of contact, access to records or decision making, if the order 
46 was in effect at the time of the parent's death.  The court must find that clear and convincing 
47 evidence exists to show that there is neither a substantial change in circumstances between 
48 the entry of the exclusive parental rights and responsibilities order and the parent's death 
49 nor that other facts exist that would render a finding based on the order to be inequitable or 
50 unjust.
9 In current law, Title 19-A, section 1658 allows a petition to terminate the parental rights 
10 and responsibilities of a parent who committed sexual assault and the sexual assault 
11 resulted in the conception of a child.  The bill allows a petition to be filed to terminate the 
12 parental rights and responsibilities of a parent in another context:  when a final court order 
13 awarded exclusive parental rights and responsibilities to another parent and that order has 
14 been in effect at least 12 months and the petition alleges that termination of the parent's 
15 rights and responsibilities is necessary to protect the child from serious harm or the threat 
16 of serious harm.  The order must have awarded exclusive parental rights and responsibilities 
17 with respect to all aspects of the child's welfare, with the possible exception of the right 
18 and responsibility for support, without reserving for the parent any rights to make decisions, 
19 to have access to records or to have contact with the child.
20 The bill allows the parent of a child to file a petition to terminate the parental rights 
21 and responsibilities of another parent of the child.  If the child's parent is a minor, the parent 
22 or guardian of the parent who is a minor may file a termination petition.
23 This bill clarifies the procedure for the termination of parental rights and 
24 responsibilities once a petition is filed.  The court must appoint an attorney for a parent 
25 who is the subject of a termination petition and is indigent.  If the action is contested and 
26 the parent who is the subject of the petition is represented by counsel, then the court may 
27 appoint an attorney for any indigent petitioner.
28 If the petition alleges that termination of parental rights and responsibilities is 
29 necessary to protect the child from serious harm or threat of serious harm and an order 
30 awarding exclusive parental rights and responsibilities has been in effect at least 12 months, 
31 the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem.
32 A parent may consent to an order terminating the parent's rights and responsibilities 
33 after a judge has fully explained the effects of a termination order and if such consent is 
34 written and voluntarily and knowingly executed in court.  Even if a parent consents to the 
35 termination of that parent's rights and responsibilities, the court must nevertheless still 
36 make the required findings.  For a petition that is based on an exclusive order of parental 
37 rights and responsibilities and that alleges that termination is necessary to protect the child 
38 from serious harm or the threat of serious harm, the petitioner must prove by clear and 
39 convincing evidence the allegations as well as that termination is in the best interest of the 
40 child.  Evidence that termination is necessary to protect the child from harm or threat of 
41 serious harm may include, but is not limited to, proof of the parent's conduct demonstrating 
42 an intent to permanently forgo all parental duties or relinquish parental claims regarding 
43 the child or proof of the parent's acts of abuse, as defined in the child protection laws, upon 
44 the petitioner or a minor child in the parent's or petitioner's household.1

Page 7 - 130LR0257(01)1 The bill provides that, except as provided in Title 19-A, section 1658 and the adoption 
2 laws in Title 18-C, a court may not terminate the parental rights and responsibilities of a 
3 parent on a petition filed by another parent or the parent or guardian of a child's parent who 
4 is a minor.
5 The bill amends the child protection laws to make consistent who may file a petition 
6 to terminate the parental rights to a child.  The requirements set out in the bill apply when 
7 a parent or the parent or guardian of a minor parent is petitioning to terminate another 
8 parent's parental rights and responsibilities, but if the petitioner is also petitioning to adopt 
9 the child, the requirements of the adoption laws in Title 18-C, Article 9 apply.
