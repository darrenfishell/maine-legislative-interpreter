6 facility was initially generated within the State or outside the State, as long as the

9 processed by that facility during the annual reporting period for that facility;
10Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §1303-C, sub-§40-A, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 619, §3, is 
11 amended to read:
12 C.  Residue generated by a solid waste processing facility that is located within the

14 within the State or outside the State, as long as:
15 (1)  The residue is used at a solid waste landfill for daily cover, frost protection or 
16 other operational or engineering-related purpose, including, but not limited to,

20 (2)  The use of the residue under subparagraph (1) complies with the requirements 
21 of section 1310‑N, subsection 5‑A, paragraph B, subparagraph (2); and
22 (3)  The weight of the residue disposed of by that facility at a solid waste landfill

24 that was processed by that facility during the annual reporting period for that 
25 facility;
26Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §1303-C, sub-§40-A, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 619, §3, is 
27 amended to read:

30 within the State or outside the State, as long as:
31 (1)  The residue does not meet the requirements of paragraph C or D;
32 (2)  The residue is not considered recycled under section 1310‑N, subsection 5‑A,

40Sec. 4.  38 MRSA §1310-N, sub-§5-A, ¶B, as amended by PL 2019, c. 619, §4, is 
41 further amended by amending subparagraph (2) to read:
Page 2 - 130LR1260(01)1 (2)  A solid waste processing facility that generates residue requiring disposal shall 
2 recycle or process into fuel for combustion all waste accepted at the facility to the 
3 maximum extent practicable, but in no case at a rate less than 50%.  For purposes 
4 of this subsection, "recycle" includes, but is not limited to, the reuse of waste 
5 generated within the State as defined in section 1303-C, subsection 40-A, 
6 paragraph C; the recovery of metals from waste; the use of waste or waste-derived 
7 product as material substitutes in construction; and the use of waste as boiler fuel 
8 substitutes.
9 At least 50% of the waste that a solid waste processing facility characterizes as 
10 recycled under this subparagraph must have been reused or recycled by the facility 
11 through methods other than placement of the waste in a solid waste landfill, except 
12 that a solid waste processing facility that was in operation during calendar year 
13 2018, that accepts exclusively construction and demolition debris and that accepted 
14 more than 200,000 tons of such debris in calendar year 2018 shall: .
15 ( a)  Reuse or recycle at least 15% of such debris through methods other than 
16 placement in a solid waste landfill by January 1, 2022; and
17 ( b)  Reuse or recycle at least 20% of such debris through methods other than 
18 placement in a solid waste landfill by January 1, 2023.
19 A solid waste processing facility that was in operation during calendar year 2018, 
20 that accepts exclusively construction and demolition debris and that accepted more 
21 than 200,000 tons of such debris in calendar year 2018 may request and the 
22 department may grant a waiver of the applicable provisions of this subparagraph 
23 for a specified period of time if the facility is able to demonstrate that compliance 
24 with the applicable provisions of this subparagraph would result in an unreasonable 
25 adverse impact on the facility.  The demonstration may include results of a 3rd-
26 party audit of the facility.  In determining whether to grant such a waiver request, 
27 the department may consider trends in local, regional, national and international 
28 markets; the availability and cost of technologies and services; transportation and 
29 handling logistics; and overall costs that may be associated with various waste 
30 handling methods.
31Sec. 5.  38 MRSA §1310-AA, sub-§3, ¶C, as amended by PL 2007, c. 338, §3 and

36 is further amended to read:
37 D.  For a determination of public benefit under subsection 1‑A only, facilitates the 
38 operation of a solid waste disposal facility and the operation of that solid waste disposal 
39 facility would be precluded or significantly impaired if the waste is not accepted. ; and
40Sec. 7.  38 MRSA §1310-AA, sub-§3, ¶E is enacted to read:
41 E.  For a proposed facility or the expansion of a facility, is not inconsistent with 
42 ensuring environmental justice for the community in which the facility or expansion is 
43 proposed.
Page 3 - 130LR1260(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill amends the definition of "waste generated within the State" to limit the amount 
3 of the residue that may be disposed of by an incineration, recycling and processing facility 
4 at a solid waste landfill in the State to the weight of the solid waste initially generated in 
5 the State by that facility during its annual reporting period.  The bill eliminates the 
6 provisions of the law regarding recycling and source reduction requirements for solid waste 
7 processing facilities that were in operation during calendar year 2018 and that accept 
8 exclusively construction and demolition debris.  It adds environmental justice to the public 
9 benefit determination standards for solid waste disposal facilities.2
