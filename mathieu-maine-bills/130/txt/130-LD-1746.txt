Page 1 - 130LR2123(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, during the First Regular Session of the 130th Legislature, Public Law 2021, 
4 chapter 474 expanded the 1998 Special Retirement Plan to include civilian employees who 
5 work for the Department of Public Safety, Maine State Police Crime Laboratory or 
6 computer crimes unit; and
7Whereas, employees of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner within the Department 
8 of the Attorney General were inadvertently omitted from inclusion in Public Law 2021, 
9 chapter 474; and
10Whereas, employees of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner are responsible for 
11 working with the bodies of victims of sudden, unexpected and violent deaths, talking with 
12 and supporting the grieving families of the victims and collecting reports of all missing 
13 people in Maine; and
14Whereas, given the recent uptick in overdose deaths and child deaths in the State, the 
15 employees of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner are faced with bleak outcomes each 
16 day; and
17Whereas, these employees deserve to be included in the 1998 Special Retirement Plan 
18 in recognition of their dedication and hard work and so that they are compensated similarly 
19 to their counterparts; and

21 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
22 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
23 therefore,
24Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
