What sort of final de-

and how itwill pay for the

“They’re eyesores down
there,” council member
Joe Minutolo said of the
structures on the pier. “I
am sure there are things
blowing off of them in big
winds.”
The removal of thebuilding and loading
bridges will at least slight-
ly improve the pier’s ap-
pearance, and will help re-
duce the load borne by the
pier’s pilings, officials
said.
Mark Wilson, an official
with Bay Ferries, told the
council that when the town
moves ahead with demol-

rest of the old pier, the
company will be willing to
consider paying some of
the costs of that project.Pier

The Sebago Lake Ice
Fish ingD erby kick so ff
this weekend with an esti-
mated $15,000 in cash and
prizes up for grabs.
This marks the 21st year
for the event, sponsored by
the Sebago Lake Rotary,
which also includes ac on-
current derby that encom-
passes all bodies of water
open to ice fishing in Cum-
berland County.
At Sebago, Maine’s sec-
ond largest lake, that
means ac hance for 1,000
expected anglers to pursue
al arge population of lake
trout (togue), including
some trophy-size fish.
The derby returns with a
rule change this year, after
more than 100 fish were
discarded on the ice in
2021.T he ne wi nitiative
will incentivize fishermen
to keep their fish —e ven if
they aren’t winning catch-
es —t ob oth reduce the
number of togue and north-
ern pike in Sebago and pro-
vide food for the communi-
ty.
The Sebago derby is an
important opportunity toreduce the population of
togue and northern pike,
the latter of which are
flourishing after being ille-
gally introduced into the
lake almost 20 years ago.
“Our goal is to reduce
the lake trout population,”
said regional biologist Jim
Pellerin, who estimates the
total annual harvest of
togue at Sebago ranges
from 3,000 to 6,000 fish.
If the harvest doesn’t
match the natural repro -
duction of the lake trout,
the population increases.
“I think last year the big
derby harvested al ittle
over 2,000 fish,” Pellerin
said. “That’s af airly large
component of that overall
harvest.”
The Sebago Lake Ice
Fishing Derby was origi -
nally ap roduct of the
Maine Department of In-
land Fisheries and Wildlife
desire to thin the lake trout
population. The species’
expansion hinders the de-
velopment of the land-
locked salmon for which
the lake is renowned.
To meet management
goals, DIF&W and derby of-
ficials are taking an ew ap -
proach.Most ice fishing derbies
pay out cash and prizes to
the three heaviest fish in
each species or group of
species. As ar esult, anglers
have traditionally kept
only the largest fish to
enter in the competition.
At Sebago, that means
the smaller lake trout and
invasive pike biologists are
trying to remove are often
put back into the water.
“The problem was that
with social media people
would cull al ot of their
fish,” Pellerin said. “They
would know what’s on the
leaderboard and they
would just release all of
their fish that are not going
to win, ifthat was the prize
structure.”
This year, the derby will
continue to pay out for the
three largest fish in each
category. However, an ew
initiative will encourage
an glerst or egisterm ore
lake trout, pike, pickerel
and perch in return for
door prizes.
“They get at icket for
each fish that they bring in
and so the more fish they
bring in, the better their
chances of winning,” said
Cyndy Bell, the public rela-tions chair for the Sebago
Lake Rotary. “We have
hundreds of door prizes
that have been donated, so
we’re really excited that we
have the support of the
community again this
year.”
Pellerin hopes the new
wrinkle will encourage an-
glers to harvest many more
togue under 26 inches, for
which there is no daily bag
limit at Sebago, and take
out ab unch of pike.
If each fish caught has
value, fewer are likely to go
to waste.
During the 2021 Sebago
derby, al arge number of
lake trout wound up dis-
carded on the ice. Although
DIF&W later suggested the
fish had been gathered up
from across the lake and
planted in one spot, the
wasted togue generated
outrage.
The new rules should cut
back on such behavior, and
the Rotary is continuing
efforts to provide fish for
the community. The Rota-
ry collects any unwanted
derby fish and takes them
to No va Se afoo di nP ort-
land for processing.
“Typically it’s made intofish chowder at Preble
Street [Resource Center],”
Bell said of the entity that
serves people in Portland
who are experiencing
homelessness.
The recent weather has
derby organizers keeping a
close watch on ice condi-
tions at Sebago, where the
largest section of the lake,
the big bay, has not frozen
over again this winter.
Now, warmer tempera -
tures and expected rain
could further erode ice on
even those areas of the lake
that have allowed for fish-
ing and snowmobiling traf-
fic the last few weeks.
“We’re just hopeful that
we can get some fishermen
out there safely,” saidCyndy Bell, the public rela-
tions chair for the Sebago
Lake Rotary.
Proceeds from this
year’s derby will benefit
the 13 Feed the Need food
pantries in the Sebago
Lake region.
Fish from the Sebago
derby have accounted for
7,128 meals at the shelter
during the last 20 years,
Webb said.
All told, the Sebago Ro-
tary also has donated more
than $1 million in support
to worthy causes across the
region.

One of the main tenants
in aM illinocket shopping
plaza that sold last year for
double its assessed value
will close this spring.
The Dollar Tree store on
Central Street in Milli-
nocket will close nine
months after the shopping
plaza where it’s located,
the Northern Shopping
Plaza, sold to aN ew Hamp-
shire company hoping to
revitalize retail in the for-
mer mill town.
The store is scheduled
to close in mid-April, said
Kayleigh Campbell, a
spokesperson for Dollar
Tree Inc., which owns both
the Dollar Tree and Fami-
ly Dollar chains.
Campbell declined to
specify why the Millinock-
et store was closing, but
said Dollar Tree occasion-
ally closes stores due to
myriad reasons such as
rent increases, property
sales and lease termina -
tions.
The dollar store closure
news comes three months
after Dollar Tree closed its
Madawaska store. The dis-
count retai ler also oper -
ates aF amily Dollar store
nearby at 781 Central St. in
Millinocket. Campbell did
not respond to aq uestion
about the future of that
store.
Uri Pe’er, the owner of
Northeast Living LLC,
which owns the Northern
Shopping Plaza, declined
to comment and said Dol-
lar Tree had instructedhim not to discuss the clo-
sure.
Pe’e rb oug ht the mall
last July for $1.6 million,
more than twice its as-
sessed va lueo f$ 738,000.
He said he was drawn to
the property because of its
proximity to Baxter State
Park and people moving to
the Katahdin region.
The plaza is among Mil -
linocket’s top 10 property
tax payers, according to a
review of the town’s as-
sessment records. Other
tenants include Tractor
Supply and Millinocket
House of Pizza.
Millinocket has striven
to rebuild its economy
after the Great Northern
Paper mill closed in 2008,
draining the town of hun-
dreds of jobs. Local non-
profit Our Katahdin
bought the mill site in 2017
and has slowly started at-
tracting businesses —i n-
cluding ad ata center and
an aquatic energy testing
site —t ot he property.
Dollar Tree reported in
November that it had
made $6.42 billion in sales
between July and Septem-
ber last year, up from $6.18
billion during the same pe-
riod the year before. That
announcement came the
same day the retailer an-
nounced that it would
raise most of its product
prices to $1.25 from $1.00.
Dollar stores have be-
come ubiquitous in
rural and small towns,
where its business model
has flourished due to its
reliance on low-wage labor
and cheap goods.Mills

WESTBROOK —G ov.
Janet Mills has unveiled
her plan for the budget sur -
plus that’s worth $822 mil-
lion.
The plan would in-
clude a$ 20 million fund for
free community college
and funding for free school
meals for all students.
If approved, $27 million
will go toward funding
free breakfasts and lunches
for students at public
schools like
in West-
brook.
That’s on
top of $10
million al-
ready set
aside by
state law -
makers.
“We’re re-
ally leading the nation in
addressing childhood food
insecurity and making
sure that kids have what
they need so that they can
grow and thrive,” Anna
Korsen of Full Plates, Full
Potential said.
Superintendent Jake
Langlais said the money
from the state would make
sure the program is paid
for.
“It’s been ar eal chal -
lenge these past few years
because we don’t gather
the data like we used to as
far as free and reduced
lunch programs go,” Lan-
glais said. “So it’s hard to
get people’s home income
data the way that schools
once did.”
Korsen said there is one
more step she’d like to see
the governor take.
“Now that we have made
sure that all kids get a
healthy school meal at no
cost, the next step is to
make sure all kids have
enough time to eat their
school meal,” Korsen said.
The program is working
with the state to lengthen
lunch times from 20 min-
utes to 30, according to
Korsen.
The idea itself doesn’t
wor ry Lan gla is, how eve r
there are concerns on
wh ethe rt he re wi ll be
enough support for the
plan to follow through.
“I think these are all
very good things, Ij ust
want to make sure that we
can sustain them and that
we are building smart,”
Langlais said.
Mills’ budget still needs
the stamp of approval, and
if it passes, it’ll go into ef-
fect on July 1.Delegationcallsforwarship

Maine’s top elected offi -
cials want an ew, Maine-
made Navy destroyer
named after aL incoln man
whose heroism in the 1993
Battle of Mogadishu was
depicted in the book and
movie “Black Hawk
Down.”
The state’s entire con -
gressional delegation and
Gov. Janet Mills sent al et-
ter Monday
to Secretary
of the Navy
Carlos Del
Toro asking
him to name
an ew Navy
warship
built at Bath
Iron Works
after U.S.
Army Master Sgt. Gary
Gordon, aL incoln native
and Medal of Honor recipi-
ent who was killed in ac-
tion in Somalia rescuing
the crew of ad owned heli-
copter.
Gordon was aD elta
Force sniper during Opera-
tion Gothic Serpent, which
culminated in the Battle of
Mogadishu, the battle inwhich Gordon lost his life.
The battle was cinemati -
cally recreated in the early
2000s movie “Black Hawk
Down.” He is portrayed by
actor Nikolaj Coster -
Waldau, of “Game of
Thrones” fame.
During the battle, Gor-
don urged his superiors to
let him go and protect the
crew of ad owned Black
Hawk helicopter from a
mob that was set to destroy
the helicopter and its crew.
He and another Delta Force
sniper, Sgt. 1st Class Randy
Shughart, were sent in to
protect the helicopter and
the crew.
Shughart and Gordon
alone pulled the crew from
the helicopter and defend-
ed their position until they
ran out of ammunition.
Both Gordon and Shughart
were killed defending the
helicopter and its crew.
In their letter to the
Navy, Maine’s top elected
officials —S ens. Susan Col-
lins and Angus King, U.S.
Reps. Chellie Pingree and
Jared Golden, as well as
Mills —s aid the warfight-
ing capabilities of aN avy
destroyer would best repre-
sent Gordon’s legacy andremind the ship’s crew of
his heroism.
“With such an amesake,
there is no doubt the crew
of the ship would serve
with the same pride, perse-
verance, and bravery as
