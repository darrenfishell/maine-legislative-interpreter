Page 1 - 130LR0506(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA §2002, sub-§3, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, 
3 is amended to read:
4 B.  "Critical investigation expense" means a necessary expense incurred by a 
5 government or by a victim while investigating or prosecuting suspected criminal 
6 conduct.  "Critical investigation expense" is limited to the cost of an audit or other 
7 financial analysis when that analysis is necessary to determine whether and to what 
8 extent a victim has suffered financial harm from criminal conduct by an employee or 
9 other person in a position of trust and the cost of analysis of suspected illegal drugs.
10SUMMARY
11 In current law, critical investigation expenses are recoverable as restitution in criminal 
12 cases.  This bill amends the definition of "critical investigation expense" to remove the cost 
13 of analysis of suspected illegal drugs.
