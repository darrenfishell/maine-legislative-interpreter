11SUMMARY
12 This bill clarifies and consolidates in a single section of Maine law the process and 
13 standards for changing the names of adults and minors.  The current process to change the 
14 name of an adult is for the adult to file a petition in the Probate Court in the county where 
15 the adult lives, except when an adult is petitioning to change that adult's name pursuant to 
16 a divorce proceeding, and this bill does not change that.  This bill provides that a parent or 
17 guardian of a minor may file a name change petition for the minor in the Probate Court in 
18 the county in which the minor lives, unless the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction 
19 regarding the minor pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 4, section 152, subsection 
20 5-A, in which case the petition must be filed in District Court.  The bill also permits a parent 
21 or guardian to request to change the minor's name as part of a proceeding concerning 
22 parentage or other parental rights with respect to the minor in the District Court.  A separate 
23 petition is not required in these cases.
24 This bill defines "parent" and "guardian" for the purposes of changing the name of a 
25 minor.
26 This bill requires the parent or guardian who requests a name change for the minor in 
27 District Court to provide notice pursuant to the applicable rules of procedure to any other 
28 parent, any guardian, any guardian ad litem and any person or agency with legal custody 
29 of the minor and to the minor if the minor is 14 years of age or older.  The court must 
30 provide an opportunity for those entitled to notice to be heard and may change the name of 
31 the minor if the court finds that the change is in the best interest of the minor.
32 This bill provides that a parent or guardian does not have to publish notice of a minor's 
33 name change unless the court orders that notice be prohibited.  It authorizes the court to 
34 make the request of a name change confidential or not public if the court limited the notice 
35 required for the name change.
36 This bill provides factors a court must consider to assess whenever a request or petition 
37 for a name change is in the best interest of the minor.
38 Because this bill consolidates the provisions governing the process for change of name, 
39 except in the case of annulment, divorce or adoption, it revises the provision in the Maine 
40 Parentage Act providing for change of name of a minor on determination of parentage.
