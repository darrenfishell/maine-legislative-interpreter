This bill prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the routine technical rules adopted 
on January 19, 2022 relating to an adult MaineCare member with a disability or an adult who is elderly who is 
receiving MaineCare services under a waiver granted by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, until January 1, 2023. There is a federal requirement that the department 
must be in compliance with the federal Home and Community Based Services settings rule, by March 17, 2023. 
Delaying the enforcement of the department's rule could impact it's ability to show compliance by March 17, 2023. If 
the department is not in compliance by this date, federal funds of around $100 million annually would be at risk. Any 
federal funds lost would need to be replaced by General Fund appropriations, as the related expenses would still be 
incurred.
