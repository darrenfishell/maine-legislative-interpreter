Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation makes changes to the laws governing unemployment compensation including certain changes that will 
expand the amount of benefits paid out of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund beginning in fiscal year 2021-
22. The impact to the trust fund will depend on the level of unemployment in the State. The estimated impact of 
these changes, developed by the Department of Labor, is provided in the table below. According to the department, 
low periods of unemployment are such periods that took place in 2019 and high periods of unemployment are such 
periods that occurred in 2009. These changes are not expected to result in an increase in an unemployment tax 
schedule. Information from the deparhnent states that, generally, a benefit cost increase of $17.0 million or greater 
has the potential of causing an increase in the schedule in the following year.

The State, with a few exceptions, is a direct reimbursement employer and, as such, would experience an increase in 
unemployment compensation costs as a result of this legislation. The impact will depend on actual experience. 
Additional costs to the Deparhnent of Labor to implement the requirements of this legislation can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
