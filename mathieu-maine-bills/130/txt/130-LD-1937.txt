17 A.  The sale of spirits to the bureau, regardless of whether the amount of the sales 
18 exceeds the thresholds for nexus specified in section 5200-B, subsection 1;

24 D.  Any other activity required by the bureau in order to facilitate the fulfillment of 
25 orders of spirits placed by the bureau.
26 Spirits manufactured or produced outside this State and brought into this State based on an 
27 order or request of the bureau when such order or request is approved from outside this

30 bureau pending the transfer of title to the bureau. 
313.  Effect on protection or exemption from taxation due to other laws.  This section

33 15 United States Code, Sections 381 to 384 or any other provision of law.  
344.  Rules.  The assessor shall adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules adopted 
35 pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
36 subchapter 2-A.
