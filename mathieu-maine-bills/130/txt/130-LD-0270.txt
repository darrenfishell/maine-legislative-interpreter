2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง15682, as amended by PL 2011, c. 419, ยง2, is further amended 
3 to read:
4ยง15682.  Regional adjustment
5 The commissioner shall make a regional adjustment in the total operating allocation 
6 for each school administrative unit determined pursuant to section 15683.  The regional 
7 adjustment must be based on the regional differences in teacher salary costs, for labor 
8 market areas in which the school administrative unit is located, as computed by a statewide 
9 education policy research institute, and must be applied only to appropriate teacher salary 
10 and benefits costs as calculated under section 15678 and salary and benefit costs of other 
11 school-level staff who are not teachers as calculated under section 15679. Beginning in 
12 fiscal year 2012-13, and for each subsequent fiscal year, the commissioner shall make a 
13 regional adjustment in the total operating allocation for each school administrative unit 
14 determined pursuant to section 15683. The regional adjustment must be based on the 
15 regional differences in teacher salary costs, for labor market areas in which the school 
16 administrative unit is located, as computed by a statewide education policy research 
17 institute, and must be applied only to appropriate teacher salary costs as calculated under 
18 section 15678 and salary costs of other school-level staff who are not teachers as calculated 
19 under section 15679.  Beginning in fiscal year 2022-23 and for each subsequent fiscal year, 
20 a school administrative unit may not receive a regional adjustment that results in a decrease 
21 in the unit's allocation for teacher salary costs under section 15678 and salary costs of other 
22 school-level staff who are not teachers as calculated under section 15679.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill requires that, beginning in fiscal year 2022-23, when the Commissioner of 
25 Education makes the regional adjustment to the total operating allocation for each school 
26 administrative unit, the commissioner may not make an adjustment that decreases a school 
27 administrative unit's allocation for teacher and other school-level staff salary costs.
