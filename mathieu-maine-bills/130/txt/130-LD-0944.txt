Page 1 - 130LR1334(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA ยง13155, sub-ยง3-A is enacted to read:
33-A.  Application and issuance; dual registration.  The commissioner, or an agent 
4 designated by the commissioner, may register and assign a dual registration number to an 
5 ATV that is also capable of being equipped with tracks for use as a snowmobile upon 
6 application and payment of an annual fee by the owner. The dual registration annual fee is 
7 the combined total of the ATV registration fee payable under subsection 5 and the 
8 snowmobile registration fee payable under section 13104, subsection 4. The commissioner 
9 shall charge a fee of $1 in addition to the annual fee for each registration issued by an 
10 employee of the department. The dual registration number in the form of stickers issued by 
11 the commissioner must be clearly displayed on the front and rear of the vehicle. A 
12 registration is valid for one year commencing July 1st of each year, except that any 
13 registration issued prior to July 1st but after May 1st is valid from the date of issuance until 
14 June 31st of the following year.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill creates a dual registration option for an all-terrain vehicle equipped with tracks 
17 to be registered as both an all-terrain vehicle and a snowmobile. Currently, an all-terrain 
18 vehicle with tracks can be registered as both, but must be registered separately. This bill 
19 creates a dual registration. It keeps the fee structures already in place for both vehicles 
20 individually, but provides for just one registration number.16
