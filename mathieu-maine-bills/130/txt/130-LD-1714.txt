16 subsection 1 to the consumer upon receipt of a verifiable consumer request from the 
17 consumer.  A business is not obligated to provide information to the consumer pursuant to 
18 this section and sections 9603, 9604 and 9605 if the business cannot verify, pursuant to this 
19 subsection and rules adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to section 9616, subsection 
20 1, paragraph G, that the consumer making the request is the consumer about whom the 
21 business has collected information or is a person authorized by the consumer to act on such 
22 consumer's behalf.
233.  Information disclosed.  A business that sells consumers' personal information, or 
24 that discloses consumers' personal information for a business purpose, shall disclose, 
25 pursuant to section 9609, subsection 1, paragraph E, subparagraph (2):
26 A.  The category or categories of consumers' personal information it has sold, or if the 
27 business has not sold consumers' personal information, it shall disclose that fact; and
28 B.  The category or categories of consumers' personal information it has disclosed for 
29 a business purpose, or if the business has not disclosed the consumers' personal 
30 information for a business purpose, it shall disclose that fact.
314.  Sale by 3rd party.  A 3rd party may not sell personal information about a consumer 
32 that has been sold to the 3rd party by a business unless the consumer has received explicit 
33 notice and is provided an opportunity to exercise the right to opt out pursuant to section 
34 9607.
355.  Violations.  A person covered by this section that violates any of the restrictions set 
36 forth in this chapter is liable for the violations.  A business that discloses personal 
37 information to a person covered by this section in compliance with this section is not liable 
38 under this chapter if the person receiving the personal information uses it in violation of 
39 the restrictions set forth in this chapter, if, at the time of disclosing the personal information, 
40 the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the person intends 
41 to commit such a violation.
42§9607.  Consumer's right to prohibit sale; right to opt out
Page 11 - 130LR0234(01)11.  Right to opt out.  A consumer has the right, at any time, to direct a business that 
2 sells personal information about the consumer to 3rd parties not to sell the consumer's 
3 personal information.  This right may be referred to as "the right to opt out."
42.  Notice of right to opt out.  A business that sells consumers' personal information 
5 to 3rd parties shall provide notice to consumers, pursuant to section 9610, subsection 1, 
6 that this information may be sold and that consumers have the right to opt out of the sale 
7 of their personal information.
83.  Right to opt in; consumer's age.  Notwithstanding subsection 1, a business may 
9 not sell the personal information of a consumer if the business has actual knowledge that 
10 the consumer is less than 16 years of age, unless the consumer, in the case of a consumer 
11 at least 13 years of age and less than 16 years of age, or the consumer's parent or guardian, 
12 in the case of a consumer less than 13 years of age, has affirmatively authorized the sale of 
13 the consumer's personal information.  A business that willfully disregards the consumer's 
14 age is deemed to have had actual knowledge of the consumer's age.
15 The affirmative authorization required under this subsection may be referred to as "the right 
16 to opt in."
174.  Sale prohibited.  A business that has received direction from a consumer not to sell 
18 the consumer's personal information or, in the case of a minor consumer's personal 
19 information has not received consent to sell the minor consumer's personal information, is 
20 prohibited, pursuant to section 9610, subsection 1, paragraph D, from selling the 
21 consumer's personal information after its receipt of the consumer's direction, unless the 
22 consumer subsequently provides express authorization for the sale of the consumer's 
23 personal information.
24§9608.  Business practices 
251.  Discrimination based on exercise of rights prohibited.  A business may not 
26 discriminate against a consumer because the consumer exercised any of the consumer's 
27 rights under this chapter, including, but not limited to, by:
28 A.  Denying goods or services to the consumer;
29 B.  Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use 
30 of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
31 C.  Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer; or
32 D.  Suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for goods or 
33 services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
34 Nothing in this subsection prohibits a business from charging a consumer a different price 
35 or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer, 
36 if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the 
37 consumer's personal information.
382.  Financial incentives.  A business may offer financial incentives, including 
39 payments to consumers as compensation, for the collection of personal information, the 
40 sale of personal information or the deletion of personal information.  A business may also 
41 offer a different price, rate, level or quality of goods or services to the consumer if that 
42 price or difference is directly related to the value provided to the business by the consumer's 
43 personal information.
Page 12 - 130LR0234(01)1 A.  A business that offers any financial incentives pursuant to this subsection shall 
2 notify consumers of the financial incentives pursuant to section 9609.
3 B.  A business may enter a consumer into a financial incentive program only if the 
4 consumer gives the business prior opt in consent pursuant to section 9609 that clearly 
5 describes the material terms of the financial incentive program, and which may be 
6 revoked by the consumer at any time.
7 C.  A business may not use financial incentive practices that are unjust, unreasonable, 
8 coercive or usurious in nature.
9§9609.  Requests for and disclosure of information
101.  Requests; disclosure and delivery.  In order to comply with sections 9603, 9604, 
11 9605, 9606 and 9608, a business shall, in a form that is reasonably accessible to consumers:
12 A.  Make available to consumers 2 or more designated methods for submitting requests 
13 for information required to be disclosed pursuant to sections 9605 and 9606, including, 
14 at a minimum, a toll-free telephone number.  
15 (1)  A business that operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with 
16 a consumer from whom it collects personal information is required to provide only 
17 an e-mail address for submitting requests for information required to be disclosed 
18 pursuant to sections 9605 and 9606.
19 (2)  If the business maintains an Internet website, the business shall make the 
20 Internet website available to consumers to submit requests for information required 
21 to be disclosed pursuant to sections 9605 and 9606;
22 B.  Disclose and deliver the required information to a consumer free of charge within 
23 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request from the consumer.  The business 
24 shall promptly take steps to determine whether the request is a verifiable consumer 
25 request, but this does not extend the business's duty to disclose and deliver the 
26 information within 45 days of receipt of the consumer's request.  The time period to 
27 provide the required information may be extended once by an additional 45 days when 
28 reasonably necessary, if the consumer is provided notice of the extension within the 
29 first 45-day period.  The disclosure must cover at least the 12-month period preceding 
30 the business's receipt of the verifiable consumer request and must be made in writing 
31 and delivered through the consumer's account with the business, if the consumer 
32 maintains an account with the business, or by mail or electronically at the consumer's 
33 option if the consumer does not maintain an account with the business, in a readily 
34 useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information from one entity 
35 to another entity without hindrance.  The business may require authentication of the 
36 consumer that is reasonable in light of the nature of the personal information requested, 
37 but may not require the consumer to create an account with the business in order to 
38 make a verifiable consumer request.  If the consumer maintains an account with the 
39 business, the business may require the consumer to submit the request through that 
40 account.
41 C.  For purposes of section 9605, subsection 2:
42 (1)  To identify the consumer, associate the information provided by the consumer 
43 in the verifiable consumer request to any personal information previously collected 
44 by the business about the consumer; and
Page 13 - 130LR0234(01)1 (2)  Identify by category or categories the personal information collected about the 
2 consumer in the preceding 12 months by reference to the enumerated category or 
3 categories in subsection 3 that most closely describe the personal information 
4 collected;
5 D.  For purposes of section 9606, subsection 2:
6 (1)  Identify the consumer and associate the information provided by the consumer 
7 in the verifiable consumer request to any personal information previously collected

10 that the business sold in the preceding 12 months by reference to the enumerated 
11 category or categories in subsection 3 that most closely describe the personal

13 personal information was sold in the preceding 12 months by reference to the 
14 enumerated category or categories in subsection 3 that most closely describe the 
15 personal information sold.  The business shall disclose the information in a list that 
16 is separate from a list generated for the purposes of subparagraph (3); and
17 (3)  Identify by category or categories the personal information of the consumer 
18 that the business disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months by 
19 reference to the enumerated category or categories in subsection 3 that most closely

21 whom the consumer's personal information was disclosed for a business purpose 
22 in the preceding 12 months by reference to the enumerated category or categories 
23 in subsection 3 that most closely describe the personal information disclosed.  The 
24 business shall disclose the information in a list that is separate from a list generated 
25 for the purposes of subparagraph (2);
26 E.  Disclose the following information in its online privacy policy or policies if the 
27 business has an online privacy policy or policies and in any description of consumers' 
28 privacy rights specific to the State or, if the business does not maintain those policies, 
29 on its Internet website and update that information at least once every 12 months:

35 describe the personal information collected;
36 (3)  For purposes of section 9606, subsection 3, paragraphs A and B, 2 separate 
37 lists:
38 (a)  A list of the categories of personal information it has sold about consumers 
39 in the preceding 12 months by reference to the enumerated category or 
40 categories in subsection 3 that most closely describe the personal information 
41 sold or, if the business has not sold consumers' personal information in the 
42 preceding 12 months, the business shall disclose that fact; and
43 (b)  A list of the categories of personal information it has disclosed about 
44 consumers for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months by reference to 
Page 14 - 130LR0234(01)45 the enumerated category or categories in subsection 3 that most closely 
46 describe the personal information disclosed or, if the business has not disclosed 
47 consumers' personal information for a business purpose in the preceding 12 
48 months, the business shall disclose that fact;
5 (4)  In the case of a business that sells or discloses deidentified patient information 
6 not subject to this chapter pursuant to section 9612, subsection 1, paragraph D, 
7 subparagraph (1), whether the business sells or discloses deidentified patient 
8 information derived from patient information and, if so, whether that patient 
9 information was deidentified pursuant to one or more of the following:

16 of all requirements in sections 9603, 9604, 9605, 9606 and 9608 and this section and 
17 how to direct consumers to exercise their rights under those sections; and
18 G.  Use any personal information collected from the consumer in connection with the 
19 business's verification of the consumer's request solely for the purposes of verification.
202.  Limit.  A business is not obligated to provide the information required by sections

23 required to be disclosed pursuant to sections 9605 and 9606 must follow the enumerated 
24 categories set out in the definition of personal information in section 9602, subsection 14.
25§9610.  Posted links and information

27 section 9607 shall, in a form that is reasonably accessible to consumers:
28 A.  Provide a clear and conspicuous link on the business's homepage, titled "Do Not 
29 Sell My Personal Information," to an Internet webpage that enables a consumer, or a 
30 person authorized by the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's personal 
31 information.  A business may not require a consumer to create an account in order to 
32 direct the business not to sell the consumer's personal information;
33 B.  Include a description of a consumer's rights pursuant to section 9607, along with a

Page 15 - 130LR0234(01)1 D.  For consumers who exercise their right to opt out of the sale of their personal 
2 information under section 9607, refrain from selling personal information collected by

12 require a business to comply with this chapter by including the required links and text on 
13 the homepage that the business makes available to the public generally, if the business 
14 maintains a separate and additional homepage that is dedicated to consumers in this State 
15 and that includes the required links and text, and the business takes reasonable steps to 
16 ensure that consumers in this State are directed to the homepage for consumers in this State 
17 and not the homepage made available to the public generally.
183.  Authorized person.  A consumer may authorize another person solely to opt out of 
19 the sale of the consumer's personal information on the consumer's behalf, and a business

40 and no personal information collected while the consumer was in the State is sold. This 
41 paragraph does not permit a business, service provider or 3rd party to store, including 
42 on a device, personal information about a consumer when the consumer is in the State 
Page 16 - 130LR0234(01)43 and then collect that personal information when the consumer and stored personal 
44 information is outside of the State.
32.  Violation of evidentiary privilege.  The obligations imposed on businesses by 
4 sections 9605 to 9610 do not apply when compliance by the business with those sections 
5 would violate an evidentiary privilege under the law of this State and do not prevent a

34 as defined in section 1171, subsection 10, if the vehicle information or ownership 
35 information is shared for the purpose of effectuating, or in anticipation of effectuating, a 
36 vehicle repair covered by a vehicle warranty or a recall conducted pursuant to 49 United 
37 States Code, Sections 30118 to 30120, as long as the new motor vehicle dealer or vehicle

15 C.  If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular 
16 because of their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, 
17 taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or 
18 communication or taking the action requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify 
19 the consumer of the reason for refusing the request.  The business shall bear the burden 
20 of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer request is manifestly unfounded or 
21 excessive.
228.  Disclosure to service provider.  A business that discloses personal information to 
23 a service provider is not liable under this chapter if the service provider receiving the 
24 personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this chapter, if, at the 
25 time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge 
26 or reason to believe that the service provider intends to commit such a violation.  A service 
27 provider is likewise not liable under this chapter for the obligations of a business for which 
28 it provides services as set forth in this chapter.
299.  Ordinary course of business.  This chapter may not be construed to require a

3 to information collected electronically or over the Internet, but apply to the collection and 
4 sale of all personal information collected by a business from consumers.  Wherever 
5 possible, law relating to consumers' personal information must be construed to harmonize 
6 with the provisions of this chapter, but in the event of a conflict between other laws and the 
7 provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the law that afford the greatest protection for 
8 the right of privacy for consumers controls.

5 information pursuant to section 9609, with the goal of minimizing the administrative 
6 burden on consumers, taking into account available technology, security concerns and 
7 the burden on the business, to govern a business's determination that a request for 
8 information received from a consumer is a verifiable consumer request, including 
9 treating a request submitted through a password-protected account maintained by the 
10 consumer with the business while the consumer is logged into the account as a 
11 verifiable consumer request and providing a mechanism for a consumer who does not

27 from the beginning to be taken with the intention of avoiding the reach of this chapter, 
28 including the disclosure of information by a business to a 3rd party in order to avoid the 
29 definition of "sell," a court shall disregard the intermediate steps or transactions for 
30 purposes of effectuating the purposes of this chapter.
31§9621.  Waiver or limit of rights void and unenforceable
32 Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in 
33 any way a consumer's rights under this chapter, including, but not limited to, any right to a 
34 remedy or means of enforcement, is deemed contrary to public policy and is void and 
35 unenforceable.  This section does not prevent a consumer from declining to request 
36 information from a business, declining to opt out of a business's sale of the consumer's 
37 personal information or authorizing a business to sell the consumer's personal information 
38 after previously opting out.
39§9622.  Liberal construction

4SUMMARY
5 This bill establishes the Maine Consumer Privacy Act, which is modeled on the 
6 California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.  It applies to the collection and sale of all 
7 personal information collected by a business from consumers.  Because the new Act covers 
8 Internet service providers, this bill repeals the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, chapter 
9 94 to keep all entities on equal footing, allowing consumers to opt out of the sale of personal 
10 information.
11 The Maine Consumer Privacy Act takes effect January 1, 2022.  The repeal of Title 
12 35-A, chapter 94 is effective January 1, 2022.5
