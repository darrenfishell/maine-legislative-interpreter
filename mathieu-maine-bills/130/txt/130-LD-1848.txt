Page 1 - 130LR2312(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  34-B MRSA §3801, sub-§7-C is enacted to read:
37-C.  Prescriber.  "Prescriber" means a licensed health care provider with authority to 
4 prescribe, including a licensed physician, certified nurse practitioner or licensed physician 
5 assistant who has training or experience in psychopharmacology.
6Sec. 2.  34-B MRSA §3801, sub-§11, as amended by PL 2017, c. 407, Pt. A, §159, 
7 is further amended to read:
811.  Assertive community treatment.  "Assertive community treatment" or "ACT" 
9 means a self-contained service with a fixed point of responsibility for providing treatment, 
10 rehabilitation and support services to persons with mental illness for whom other 
11 community-based treatment approaches have been unsuccessful.  Assertive community 
12 treatment uses clinical and rehabilitative staff to address symptom stability; relapse 
13 prevention; maintenance of safe, affordable housing in normative settings that promote 
14 well-being; establishment of natural support networks to combat isolation and withdrawal; 
15 the minimizing of involvement with the criminal justice system; individual recovery 
16 education; and services to enable the person to function at a work site. Assertive community 
17 treatment is provided by multidisciplinary teams who are on duty 24 hours per day, 7 days 
18 per week; teams must include a psychiatrist  prescriber, registered nurse  or licensed 
19 practical nurse, certified rehabilitation counselor or certified employment specialist, a peer 
20 recovery specialist and a substance use disorder counselor and may include an occupational 
21 therapist, community-based mental health rehabilitation technician, psychologist, licensed 
22 clinical social worker or licensed clinical professional counselor. A licensed practical nurse 
23 may be included on an ACT team in lieu of a registered nurse if the prescriber is not a 
24 certified nurse practitioner. An ACT team member who is a state employee is, while in 
25 good faith performing a function as a member of an ACT team, performing a discretionary 
26 function within the meaning of Title 14, section 8104‑B, subsection 3.
27SUMMARY
28 This bill amends the behavioral and developmental services law regarding mental 
29 health hospitalization to add the definition of "prescriber," which is defined to mean a 
30 licensed health care provider with authority to prescribe, including a licensed physician, 
31 certified nurse practitioner or licensed physician assistant who has training or experience 
32 in psychopharmacology.  It also amends the definition of "assertive community treatment" 
33 to change the composition of the multidisciplinary team that provides assertive community 
34 treatment by removing reference to the term "psychiatrist" and replacing it with the term 
35 "prescriber" and by providing that a licensed practical nurse may be a member of the team 
36 in lieu of a registered nurse if the prescriber is not a certified nurse practitioner.28
