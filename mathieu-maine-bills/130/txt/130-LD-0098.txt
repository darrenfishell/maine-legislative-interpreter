39SUMMARY

41 providers in order to ensure consistency between provider types.  Specifically, the bill:
Page 7 - 130LR0064(01)1 1.  Provides clarity on the department's ability to levy civil penalties against those who 
2 violate statutes or licensing rules governing child care facilities;
3 2.  Allows the department to regulate the quality of the program of child care that is 
4 provided by providers classified as family child care providers;
5 3.  Allows the department to regulate the administration of medication by providers 
6 classified as family child care providers; and
7 4.  Replaces all references to the certification of family child care providers with 
8 references to licensure.
