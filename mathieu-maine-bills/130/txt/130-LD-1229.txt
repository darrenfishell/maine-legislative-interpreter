5 of that fact;
6 B.  Display the ultrasound images so that the pregnant woman may view the images;
7 C.  Provide a medical description of the ultrasound images, which must include the 
8 dimensions of the fetus and the presence of external members and internal organs, if

10 D.  Retain in the pregnant woman's medical record a signed certification from the 
11 pregnant woman that she has been presented with the information required to be 
12 provided under paragraph C and has viewed the ultrasound images or declined to do 
13 so.  The signed certification must be on a form provided by the department.
142.  Not viewed.  When the ultrasound images are provided to and reviewed by the 
15 pregnant woman under subsection 1, nothing in this section may be construed to prevent 
16 the pregnant woman from averting her eyes from the ultrasound images.  The health care 
17 professional, the qualified ultrasound provider and the pregnant woman may not be subject 
18 to any penalty if the pregnant woman refuses to look at the displayed ultrasound images.
193.  Definitions.  As used in this section, the following terms have the following

21 A.  "Abortion" has the same meaning as set forth in section 1598, subsection 2,

29SUMMARY
30 This bill requires a health care professional to ensure that a pregnant woman undergoes

32 the child, at least 48 hours before she can have an abortion.  The existence of a medical 
33 emergency eliminates the 48-hour waiting period.30
