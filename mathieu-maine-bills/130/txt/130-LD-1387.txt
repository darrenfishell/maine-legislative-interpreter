2Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §2526, sub-§5, ¶C, as amended by PL 2003, c. 234, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 C.  When a town has not elected a full board of assessors, the selectmen shall serve as 
5 assessors as provided in Title 36, section 703.  A selectman who is an assessor pursuant 
6 to this paragraph and Title 36, section 703 or any person who serves as both a selectman 
7 and a tax assessor may resign the position of assessor without resigning the office of 
8 selectman.  The position of assessor must then be filled by appointment pursuant to 
9 section 2602, subsection 2.  A person elected to the State Legislature who resigns the 
10 position of assessor pursuant to this paragraph may continue to serve concurrently as 
11 selectman and member of the State Legislature.  If a person who is serving in the State 
12 Legislature or in another office incompatible with the position of assessor resigns the 
13 position of assessor pursuant to this paragraph before that person has performed any 
14 duties as tax assessor, that person may not be deemed to have vacated the previously 
15 held position of State Legislator or other office that is incompatible with the office of 
16 assessor.
