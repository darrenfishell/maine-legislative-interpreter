312.  Vulnerable users.  A law enforcement officer who investigates a reportable 
4 accident involving a vulnerable user or an allegation of a criminal violation that endangered 
5 a vulnerable user or the property of a vulnerable user shall inform a district attorney of 
6 relevant jurisdiction about the investigation and any evidence relevant to the potential 
7 prosecution of an alleged criminal violation resulting from the investigation within 60 days
