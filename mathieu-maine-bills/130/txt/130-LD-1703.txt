315.  Fees.  A bail commissioner is entitled to receive a fee not to exceed $60 for the 
32 charges pursuant to which the defendant is presently in custody.  The bail commissioner 
33 shall submit such forms as the Judicial Department directs to verify the amount of fees 
34 received under this subsection.  The sheriff of the county in which the defendant is detained 
35 may create a fund for the distribution by the sheriff or the sheriff's designee for the payment 
36 in whole or in part of the $60 bail commissioner fee for those defendants who do not have 
37 the financial ability to pay that fee.

41 upon personal recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond,

43 may not refuse to examine a person to determine a person's eligibility for bail, set bail,

45 because the defendant lacks the present financial ability to pay a bail commissioner 
46 fee.

7 the distribution by the sheriff or the sheriff's designee for the payment in whole or in 
8 part of the $60 bail commissioner fee for those defendants who do not have the 
9 financial ability to pay that fee.
10 A bail commissioner fee under this subsection is not a financial condition of release for the 
11 purposes of subsection 4, paragraph H or section 1026, subsection 3, paragraph B-1.

13 to read:
142-A.  Release on personal recognizance or unsecured appearance bond.  Except 
15 for a formerly capital offense under section 1027, there is a rebuttable presumption that a 
16 defendant must be released on personal recognizance under this section without a condition 
17 imposed under subsection 3.  The judicial officer shall order the pretrial release of the 
18 defendant on personal recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond in 
19 an amount specified by the judicial officer, unless, after consideration of the factors listed 
20 in subsection 4, the judicial officer determines that:
21 A.  The release would not reasonably ensure the appearance result in an imminent risk 
22 of willful flight of the defendant  as required;
23 B.  The release would not reasonably ensure that the defendant would refrain from any 
24 new criminal conduct;
25 C.  The release would not reasonably ensure the integrity of the judicial process; or
26 D.  The release would not reasonably ensure the safety of others in the community.
27Sec. 6.  15 MRSA §1026, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 407, Pt. A, §51, 
28 is further amended to read:
29 A.  If, after consideration of the factors listed in subsection 4, the judicial officer 
30 determines by clear and convincing evidence that the release described in subsection 
31 2‑A will not reasonably ensure the appearance result in an imminent risk of willful 
32 flight of the defendant  at the time and place required, will not reasonably ensure that 
33 the defendant will refrain from any new criminal conduct, will not reasonably ensure 
34 the integrity of the judicial process or will not reasonably ensure the safety of others in 
35 the community, the judicial officer shall order the pretrial release of the defendant 
36 subject to the least restrictive further condition or combination of conditions that the 
37 judicial officer determines will reasonably ensure the appearance of the defendant at 
38 the time and place required  not result in an imminent risk of willful flight, will 
39 reasonably ensure that the defendant will refrain from any new criminal conduct, will 
40 reasonably ensure the integrity of the judicial process and will reasonably ensure the 
41 safety of others in the community.  These conditions may include that the defendant:

14 the defendant and ensure the integrity of the judicial process and the safety of others in the 
15 community, the judge or justice shall issue an order under section 1026.  If the judicial 
16 finding is otherwise, the judge or justice shall issue an order denying bail.
17SUMMARY
18 This bill prohibits a bail commissioner or judicial officer from imposing a financial 
19 condition of release on a defendant whose most serious crime charged is a Class E crime.  
20 However, the prohibition on financial conditions of release does not apply when the Class 
21 E crime was any of the following:
22 1.  A violation of the Maine Criminal Code, chapter 11, which covers sexual assault 
23 crimes;
24 2.  A crime committed against a family or household member or a dating partner;
25 3.  A violation of a condition of release when the underlying crime for which the 
26 defendant has been released on bail is a violation of the Maine Criminal Code, chapter 11 
27 or a crime against a family or household member or a dating partner; 
28 4.  A violation of a condition of release that is premised on an allegation of new criminal 
29 conduct; or
30 5.  A violation of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 1091, subsection 1, 
31 which makes failure to appear in court when required to do so a crime.
32 The bill provides that a defendant who is otherwise eligible to be released on personal 
33 recognizance or upon the execution of an unsecured appearance bond, whether or not 
34 accompanied by one or more conditions of bail, must be released if the defendant cannot 
35 afford to pay the bail commissioner fee.  The bill clarifies that the bail commissioner fee is 
36 not a financial condition of release for the purposes of the prohibition on financial 
37 conditions of release for certain Class E crimes and provides that except for a formerly 
38 capital offense, there is a rebuttable presumption that a defendant must be released on 
39 personal recognizance with no conditions.  The bill changes the requirements for setting 
40 personal recognizance bail from a determination that the release would reasonably ensure 
41 the appearance of the defendant to a determination that the release would not result in an 
42 imminent risk of willful flight by the defendant.1

Page 8 - 130LR1831(01)1 The bill removes from the list of potential conditions of release for preconviction bail 
2 being required to submit to a random search for possession or use of alcohol or use of illegal 
3 drugs when use or possession is prohibited by a condition of release, unless the defendant 
4 is a participant in a specialty court docket or as agreed by the parties as a part of a deferred 
5 disposition.  The bill also eliminates the condition that requires the defendant to report on 
6 a regular basis to the defendant's attorney.  The bill requires a court when imposing a 
7 financial condition to find by clear and convincing evidence that the condition is not in 
8 excess of that necessary to ensure that the defendant does not willfully flee the jurisdiction 
9 and the defendant has the resources to pay within 24 hours.  The court is required to state 
10 its findings on the record or in writing,
11 The bill revises the list of factors a judicial officer considers when setting preconviction 
12 bail to remove consideration of the defendant's family ties in the State, although it retains 
13 consideration of the defendant's ties to the State; although the judicial officer is still 
14 required to consider the defendant's past conduct, the bill eliminates the consideration of 
15 any history of substance use disorder.  It also adds 3 new factors to be considered by the 
16 judicial officer:
17 1.  Whether the defendant is the person primarily responsible for the care of another 
18 person;
19 2.  Whether the defendant has a specific health care need, including a mental health 
20 care need, that is being met or would be better met outside of custody; and
21 3.  Whether being placed or remaining in custody would prevent the defendant from 
22 maintaining employment.
