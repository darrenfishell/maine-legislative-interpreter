Page 1 - 130LR2002(01)1Preamble.  Whereas, the scientific and technical subcommittee of the Maine 
2 Climate Council determined it is likely that the sea level in Maine will rise between 3 and 
3 5 feet by the year 2100 based on an intermediate sea level rise scenario, although scenarios 
4 of higher rise are physically plausible; and
5Whereas, a one-foot increase in sea level in the future will lead to a 15-fold increase 
6 in the frequency of nuisance flooding and would cause a 100-year storm flood level to have 
7 a probability of occurring once every 10 years; and
8Whereas, communities with a strong dependence on waterfront and shorefront 
9 industries such as tourism, ports and fishing will be heavily disrupted by increased flood 
10 frequency; and
11Whereas, sea level rise of 3.9 feet by 2100 is projected to cause more than 
12 $671,000,000 in cumulative building losses and $665,000,000 in gross domestic product 
13 losses in Maine; and
14Whereas, 1.5 feet of relative sea level rise by 2050 and 3.9 feet by 2100 would cause 
15 immersion and submersion of land and accompanying materials, structures and facilities 
16 that are not currently designed for those conditions and, therefore, present a threat of release 
17 of pollutants to the environment; and
18Whereas, the scientific and technical subcommittee of the Maine Climate Council has 
19 recommended that the State manage for 1.5 feet of relative sea level rise by 2050 and 3.9 
20 feet by 2100; now, therefore, be it
21Sec. 1.  Department review of laws and rules.  Resolved: That the Department 
22 of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, the Department of Defense, Veterans and 
23 Emergency Management, Maine Emergency Management Agency, the Department of 
24 Environmental Protection, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the 
25 Department of Marine Resources and the Department of Transportation shall conduct a 
26 review of the laws and rules they are charged with administering under the Maine Revised 
27 Statutes and, by January 1, 2022, shall recommend to the Joint Standing Committee on 
28 Environment and Natural Resources any changes necessary to:
29 1.  Incorporate consideration of 1.5 feet of relative sea level rise by 2050 and 3.9 feet 
30 by 2100 into administration of those laws and rules; and  
31 2.  Implement the strategy designated as "Strategy F3" in the state climate action plan 
32 issued by the Maine Climate Council in 2020 pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
33 38, section 577 to enhance community resilience to flooding and other climate impacts.  
34 The Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources may report out 
35 legislation to implement the recommendations to the Second Regular Session of the 130th 
36 Legislature.
