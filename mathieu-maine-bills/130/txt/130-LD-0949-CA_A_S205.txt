general funds for emergency rate relief for nursing facilities to provide funding to account 
for increased costs related to coronavirus disease 2019, referred to in this resolve as

Manual, Chapter III, Section 67, Principles of Reimbursement for Nursing Facilities, to 
increase reimbursement rates by the combined amount of $20 million in state funds 
together with allowable federal matching Medicaid funds. The department shall implement 
the same accountability and transparency requirements, requirements regarding the 
appropriate use of funds, bonus payments for job perfo1mance and cost settlement 
requirements that applied to the use of temporary rate increases that were in effect from 
March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The increased rates under this section must remain in 
effect until December 31, 2021 or until the state of emergency due to COVID-19 has ended 
as declared by the Governor, whichever is later. The department shall allocate the funds 
through a process modeled after the rate relief that was in effect from March 1, 2020 to 
May 31, 2020 and that targets lower-occupancy facilities beginning immediately and 
through December 31, 2021 but that applies to costs retroactive to the most recent quarter

department shall allocate $12.5 million in remaining available federal funding from the 
federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, for facility 
grants to nursing facilities and to private nonmedical institution Appendix C facilities for 
COVID-19 related expenses. Seventy percent of this amount must be allocated to nursing 
facilities and 30% must be allocated to private nonmedical institution Appendix C facilities. 
These grants must be disbursed by July 1, 2021 to provide immediate relief and avoid 
facility closures. The Depaiiment of Economic and Community Development shall 
allocate the disbursement using the same or similar guidelines used by the federal 
Department of Health and Human Services in its disbursement of CARES Act federal relief 
funding directed to facilities in the last 12 months. 
Sec. 3. Department of Health and Human Services to waive certain audit 
cost settlement rules. Resolved: That the department shall amend its rules and 
practices so that the grant funds provided pursuant to section 2 are not cost settled under 
the depaiiment's nursing facility audit processes but are retained by nursing facilities. The 
department shall waive any reduction or adjustment to allowable MaineCare costs on filed 
or audited cost reports under department rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, 
Chapter III, Section 67, Principles of Reimbursement for Nursing Facilities, that would 
otherwise result from the receipt of the rate relief from the grant funds. 
Sec. 4. Department of Health and Human Services; Nursing Facilities 
account; lapsed balances. Resolved: That, notwithstanding any provision of law to 
the contrary, $20 million of unencumbered balance forward from the Department of Health 
and Human Services, Nursing Facilities, General Fund can-ying account, All Other line
