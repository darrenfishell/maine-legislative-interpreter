2Sec. 1.  4 MRSA §8-D is enacted to read:
3§8-D.  Rules; assessment of indigency and ability to pay
41.  Rules.  The Supreme Judicial Court may prescribe, repeal, add to, amend or modify 
5 rules or orders providing for a procedure in all courts through which an individual's 
6 financial capacity is assessed for the following purposes:
7 A.  To determine eligibility for a court-appointed attorney.  The eligibility standards 
8 must take into account the possibility of a party's ability to make periodic installment 
9 payments toward counsel fees;
10 B.  To determine whether a party qualifies to proceed in forma pauperis; and
11 C.  To determine, after a fine has been ordered in a criminal case, a party's ability to 
12 pay and the schedule for payments.
132.  Partial indigency and reimbursement.  This subsection applies to partial 
14 indigency and reimbursement of expenses incurred by assigned counsel or contract 
15 counsel.
16 A.  If the court determines that a defendant or civil party is unable to pay to obtain 
17 private counsel but is able to contribute to payment of assigned counsel or contract 
18 counsel, the court shall order the defendant or civil party to make periodic installment 
19 payments up to the full cost of representation or to pay a fixed contribution.  The court 
20 shall remit payments received to the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services 
21 under section 1801.
22 B.  A defendant or civil party may not be required to pay for legal services in an amount 
23 greater than the expenses actually incurred.
24 C.  Upon petition of a defendant or civil party who is incarcerated, the court may 
25 suspend an order for reimbursement issued pursuant to this subsection until the time of 
26 the defendant's or civil party's release.
27Sec. 2.  4 MRSA §1804, sub-§2, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. UUUU, 
28 §1, is repealed.
29Sec. 3.  4 MRSA §1805, sub-§10-A, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. UUUU, 
30 §13, is amended to read:
3110-A.  Reimbursement of expenses.  Administer and improve reimbursement of 
32 expenses incurred by assigned counsel and contract counsel as described in section 1805‑A;
33Sec. 4.  4 MRSA §1805-A, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. UUUU, §14, is 
34 repealed.
35Sec. 5.  15 MRSA §815 is enacted to read:
36§815.  Communication between prosecutor and unrepresented defendant
37 To ensure that all waivers of the right to counsel are made knowingly, voluntarily and 
38 intelligently, a prosecutor may not communicate with an unrepresented defendant unless:
391.  Informed of right.  The defendant has been informed of the defendant's right to 
40 court-appointed counsel;
Page 2 - 130LR2056(01)12.  Statement by the court.  The court has provided to the defendant a statement of:
2 A.  The substance of the charges against the defendant;
3 B.  The defendant's right to retain counsel, to request the assignment of counsel and to 
4 be allowed a reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel before entering a plea;
5 C.  The defendant's right to remain silent and that the defendant is not required to make 
6 a statement and that any statement made by the defendant may be used against the 
7 defendant;
8 D.  The maximum possible sentence and any applicable mandatory minimum sentence; 
9 and
10 E.  The defendant's right to trial by jury; and
113.  Written waiver.  The defendant has executed a written waiver of the right to 
12 counsel in each prosecution.
13SUMMARY
14 This bill transfers the financial screening function for eligibility for indigent legal 
15 services from the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services to the judicial branch and 
16 expands the screening to also provide information to determine whether a party qualifies 
17 to proceed in forma pauperis and is thereby entitled to a waiver of filing fees and other fees 
18 and to determine, after a fine has been ordered in a criminal case, a party's ability to pay 
19 and the schedule for payments.  The bill transfers language concerning determinations of 
20 partial indigency and reimbursement of counsel expenses that currently is within the Maine 
21 Commission on Indigent Legal Services provisions to provisions governing the Supreme 
22 Judicial Court and repeals current provisions requiring Maine Commission on Indigent 
23 Legal Services' involvement in indigency determinations and collection efforts, including 
24 the authority to enter into contracts for collection.
25 The bill also prohibits prosecutors from communicating with an unrepresented 
26 defendant unless the defendant has been informed of the defendant's right to appointed 
27 counsel, the court has provided the required statement of rights as specified in Maine Rules 
28 of Criminal Procedure, Rule 5(b) and the defendant has executed a written waiver of the 
29 right to counsel in each prosecution.  A defendant's waiver of the right to counsel must be 
30 knowing, voluntary and intelligent.  The Sixth Amendment Center recommended this 
31 requirement based on Faretta v. California, 422 US 806 (1975).14
