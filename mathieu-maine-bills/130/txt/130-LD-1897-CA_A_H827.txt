Potential Future Impact -General Fund 
While there could be significant cost savings after October 1, 2025 from no longer using the Long Creek Youth 
Development Center for detention or confinement of juveniles, it will not be known until a report is prepared and 
implemented where such juveniles will be detained after that date and what future costs will be associated with an 
alternative to Long Creek and for the use of the facility. Future legislation implementing these decisions will reflect 
that fiscal impact. 
Additional costs to the Department of Corrections associated with preparing a report can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
