14 attributable to the new employing unit;
15 (4)  The leaving was necessary to protect the claimant or any member of the 
16 claimant's immediate family from domestic abuse or the leaving was due to 
17 domestic violence that caused the claimant reasonably to believe that the claimant's 
18 continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the claimant or any member 
19 of the claimant's immediate family and the claimant made all reasonable efforts to 
20 preserve the employment; or
21 (5)  The claimant's employer announced in writing to employees that it planned to 
22 reduce the work force through a layoff or reduction in force and that employees 
23 may offer to be among those included in the layoff or reduction in force, at which 
24 time the claimant offered to be one of the employees included in the layoff or 
25 reduction in force and the claimant's employer accepted the claimant's offer, 
26 thereby ending the employment relationship. ; or
27 (6)  The leaving was the result of the loss of child care or transportation when no 
28 reasonable alternatives were available within the time necessary to maintain 
29 employment.
30 Separation from employment based on the compelling family reasons , including those 
31 listed in subparagraphs (1), (2)  and, (4) and (6) does not result in disqualification.
32 B.  For the duration of his a claimant's unemployment period subsequent to his the 
33 claimant's having retired; or having been retired from his regular employment as a 
34 result of a recognized employer policy or program, under which he the claimant is

2 contributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund under this chapter lays off or 
3 reduces the hours of employment for more than 25% of the employer's employees at an 
4 establishment or facility where such employees were employed at the time of the layoff or 
5 reduction in hours, the employer shall file an initial claim for unemployment compensation 
6 benefits, along with all wage and other information needed to process the claim, on behalf 
7 of each such employee in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of Labor.  The 
8 employer shall notify each employee on behalf of whom the employer filed a claim for

14 accordance with this chapter.
152.  Claim for benefits.  If an employer fails to file a timely claim for unemployment 
16 compensation benefits for an employee in accordance with this section, and the employee 
17 does not file a timely claim for unemployment compensation benefits for that separation, 
18 the employee's claim is deemed to have been filed on the Sunday of the initial week the 
19 employee would have otherwise been eligible to receive unemployment compensation 
20 benefits following that separation.  The employer has the burden of demonstrating 
21 compliance with the provisions of this section.
