4substances testing.  The department may not license the land application or distribution of 
5 sludge or sludge-derived compost unless:
6 A.  The sludge or sludge-derived compost is tested for all perfluoroalkyl and 
7 polyfluoroalkyl substances that may reasonably be quantified by a laboratory certified 
8 under the program established under Title 22, section 567; and
9 B.  The screening level for a perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance that is in the 
10 sludge or sludge-derived compost and for which the department has established by rule

12 use established by the department.
13 The board shall adopt rules to implement this subsection that include, but are not limited 
14 to, a requirement that sludge and sludge-derived compost intended for land application or 
15 distribution be tested at least annually.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are

24 Chapter 418: Maine Solid Waste Management Rules: Beneficial Use of Solid Wastes to:
251.  Update established screening levels.  Update the screening levels for beneficial 
26 use for all perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances for which a screening level for

292.  Establish screening levels for additional perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
30substances.  Establish screening levels for beneficial use for perfluorohexane sulfonic acid,

32SUMMARY
33 This bill prohibits the land application or distribution of sludge or sludge-derived 
34 compost unless it is tested for all perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances that may 
35 reasonably be quantified by a laboratory and the screening level for a perfluoroalkyl and 
36 polyfluoroalkyl substance that is in the sludge or sludge-derived compost and for which the 
37 Department of Environmental Protection has established a screening level for beneficial 
38 use in rule does not exceed the screening level for beneficial use established by the 
39 department.  It requires the department to adopt rules to implement the requirements of the
