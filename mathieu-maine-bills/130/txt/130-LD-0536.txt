10 term of imprisonment be tolled and service of the nonconcurrent sentence commence 
11 immediately and the court shall so order if any undischarged term of imprisonment is a 
12 split sentence. No portion of the nonconcurrent sentence may be suspended. Any sentence 
13 that the convicted individual receives as a result of the conviction of a crime while in 
14 execution of a term of imprisonment must be nonconcurrent with all other sentences.
15 This subsection also applies to prisoners on supervised community confinement pursuant 
16 to Title 34-A, section 3036-A. 
172.  Discretionary nonconcurrent sentence.  Notwithstanding section 1608, when an

21 convicted of failure to report as ordered after a stay of execution of any term of 
22 imprisonment, the court may order that the sentence is not concurrent with any 
23 undischarged term of imprisonment.  If the court orders that the sentence is not concurrent, 
24 the court may order that any undischarged term of imprisonment be tolled and service of 
25 the nonconcurrent sentence commence immediately, and the court shall so order if any 
26 undischarged term of imprisonment is a split sentence.  No portion of the nonconcurrent 
27 sentence may be suspended.  Any nonconcurrent sentence that the convicted individual

49 these funds  forward the funds, as provided in section 2009, to the Treasurer of State to be 
50 handled as unclaimed property.
8Sec. B-2.  17-A MRSA §2016, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is

25 probation as authorized by chapter 49 if the grounds for arrest or prosecution are obtained 
26 as a result of the person's seeking medical assistance, administering naloxone 
27 hydrochloride or experiencing a drug-related overdose.
28PART E
29Sec. E-1.  17-A MRSA §257, as amended by PL 2007, c. 476, §3, is repealed.
30SUMMARY
31 This bill is submitted by the Criminal Law Advisory Commission pursuant to the 
32 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 1354, subsection 2.
33 Part A of the bill authorizes nonconcurrent sentencing when a crime is committed by a 
34 convicted person during a stay of execution of any term of imprisonment or after failure to 
35 report after a stay of execution of any term of imprisonment.  It also authorizes 
36 nonconcurrent sentencing when the convicted person is convicted of the crime of failure to 
37 report as ordered after a stay of execution of any term of imprisonment.
38 Part B amends Title 17-A, section 2016 to make it consistent with existing law in Title 
39 17-A, section 2009 with respect to disposition of funds by correctional facilities when they 
Page 4 - 130LR0389(01)40 hold funds for the purposes of restitution and the victim cannot be located.  Current Title 
41 17-A, section 2016 requires the facility to notify the court and the court to determine 
42 distribution of the funds.  The bill requires the facility to forward the funds to the Treasurer 
43 of State to be handled as unclaimed property, consistent with current Title 17-A, section 
44 2009.
6 Part C separates 2 variants of kidnapping, restraining a person with intent to commit 
7 bodily injury and restraining a person with intent to commit a sexual assault, which are 
8 included in current law in the same provision.  This Part amends the Sex Offender 
9 Registration and Notification Act of 2013 to clarify that, beginning January 1, 2022, 
10 kidnapping with intent to commit sexual assault, and not kidnapping with intent to commit 
11 bodily injury, qualifies as a Tier III offense under that Act.  This Part also clarifies that, 
12 beginning January 1, 2022, kidnapping with intent to commit sexual assault, and not 
13 kidnapping with intent to commit bodily injury, renders a person ineligible for interment 
14 in the Maine Veterans' Memorial Cemetery System.
15 Part D clarifies that immunity from revocation of probation is limited to the same 
16 conduct for which there is immunity from prosecution under the law protecting persons 
17 seeking medical assistance or administering naloxone hydrochloride or experiencing a 
18 drug-related overdose.
19 Part E repeals a section of law in Title 17-A, chapter 11 on factors aiding in predicting 
20 high-risk sex offenders for sentencing purposes, leaving individual risk assessment at 
21 sentencing to the judgment of the court.1
