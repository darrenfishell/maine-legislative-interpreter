2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA ยง1310-N, sub-ยง11-A is enacted to read:
311-A.  Leachate treatment to reduce perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
4substances.  Beginning July 1, 2025, a solid waste disposal facility owned by the State 
5 may not be licensed or otherwise authorized to transfer leachate from the solid waste 
6 disposal facility to a wastewater treatment plant unless: 
7 A.  Prior to the transfer the leachate is treated to reduce the concentration of 
8 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to the extent feasible with available 
9 technology; or
10 B.  The wastewater treatment plant receiving the leachate employs technology to 
11 reduce the concentration of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances in all of its 
12 discharges and residual sludge to the extent feasible with available technology and at 
13 least as effectively as could be achieved through treatment of the leachate prior to its 
14 transfer.
15 The department shall adopt rules implementing this subsection, which must include, but 
16 are not limited to, allowable concentrations of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
17 substances, technology requirements and monitoring requirements.  Rules adopted 
18 pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
19 subchapter 2-A.  For the purposes of this subsection, "wastewater treatment plant" has the 
20 same meaning as in Title 32, section 4171, subsection 4 and "perfluoroalkyl and 
21 polyfluoroalkyl substances" has the same meaning as in Title 32, section 1732, subsection 
22 5-A.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill provides that a solid waste disposal facility owned by the State may not be 
25 licensed or otherwise authorized to transfer leachate from the solid waste disposal facility 
26 to a wastewater treatment plant unless prior to the transfer the leachate is treated to reduce 
27 the concentration of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or the facility receiving 
28 the leachate employs technology to reduce the concentration of perfluoroalkyl and 
29 polyfluoroalkyl substances.  It requires the Department of Environmental Protection to 
30 adopt rules to implement the prohibition.24
