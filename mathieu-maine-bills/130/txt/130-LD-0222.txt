17SUMMARY
18 This bill amends the Maine Parentage Act to include 2 provisions that are part of the 
19 Uniform Parentage Act adopted by the Uniform Law Commission in 2017.
20 The bill amends the acknowledgment of paternity provision to broaden the process to 
21 be an acknowledgment of parentage and allows intended parents participating in assisted 
22 reproduction, as well as presumed parents, to sign the acknowledgment of parentage.  
23 The bill adds a new subchapter 9 to the Maine Parentage Act to apply to the collection 
24 and sharing of information about donors who donate gametes used in assisted reproduction.  
25 It requires gamete banks and fertility clinics to collect information from donors and requires 
26 a donor to sign a declaration allowing the sharing of identifying information about the 
27 donor or prohibiting the sharing of identifying information about the donor.  A person 
28 conceived by assisted reproduction who has attained 18 years of age or, if the person is a 
29 minor, the parent or guardian may request identifying information about the donor from 
30 the gamete bank or fertility clinic.  If the donor signed a declaration prohibiting the sharing 
31 of identifying information about the donor, the gamete bank or fertility clinic may share 
32 only nonidentifying information.  If the donor did not agree to the sharing of identifying 
33 information, the gamete bank or fertility clinic must make a good faith effort to contact the 
34 donor, who may then authorize the sharing of the information.  Otherwise, the gamete bank 
35 or fertility clinic may share the identifying information upon request.  The person or, if the 
36 person is a minor, the parent or guardian may request nonidentifying information about the 
37 donor, and the gamete bank or fertility clinic is required to make a good faith effort to 
38 provide the information.
