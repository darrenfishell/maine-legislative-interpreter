5Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within

8 therefore,
9Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
10Sec. 1.  21-A MRSA ยง1006 is enacted to read:

131.  Definition.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, "foreign 
14 government-owned entity" means an entity with respect to which a foreign government 
15 holds, owns, controls or otherwise has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of 10% or 
16 more of the total equity, outstanding voting shares, membership units or other applicable 
17 ownership interests.
182.  Contribution prohibited.  A foreign government-owned entity may not make, 
19 directly or indirectly, a contribution of money or anything of value to influence a 
20 referendum.
213.  Solicitation or acceptance of contribution prohibited.  A person may not solicit, 
22 accept or receive a contribution described in subsection 2 from a foreign government-
23 owned entity.
244.  Expenditure prohibited.  A foreign government-owned entity may not make, 
25 directly or indirectly, an expenditure to influence a referendum.
265.  Participation prohibited.  A foreign government-owned entity may not direct,

306.  Violation; penalty.  Notwithstanding section 1004, subsection 1, a person that

32 or twice the amount of the contribution or expenditure involved in the violation, whichever 
33 is greater, may be adjudged.  In assessing a penalty, the commission shall consider, among 
34 other things, whether the violation was intentional and whether the person who committed

36 owned entity that made a direct or indirect contribution prohibited in subsection 2 or 3, that 
37 made a direct or indirect expenditure prohibited in subsection 4 or that directly or indirectly 
38 participated in the decision-making process of any person as prohibited in subsection 5.
