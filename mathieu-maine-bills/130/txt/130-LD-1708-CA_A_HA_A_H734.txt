This amendment increases the payments in lieu of taxes from the amount of property taxes the investor-owned 
transmission and distribution utility would have paid to 120% of those property taxes. 
The amendment also provides that the just value of all utility facilities and utility property be included in the annual

sharing and general purpose aid for education, but may change how much certain municipalities are allocated.
