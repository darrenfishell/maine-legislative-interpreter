8 The powers granted in divisions (a) and (c) terminate 30 days following the 
9 termination of the state of emergency.
10Sec. 2.  37-B MRSA §742, sub-§1, ¶E is enacted to read:
11 E. The Governor, during the pendency of a state of emergency, may not reissue or 
12 renew an emergency proclamation, issue another emergency proclamation that is 
13 substantially similar to one that expired or reissue an emergency proclamation that the 
14 Legislature has terminated pursuant to paragraph F without approval of the Legislature 
15 pursuant to paragraph F, except that the Governor, based on significant changes in 
16 circumstances, may reimpose such an emergency proclamation for a single period of 3 
17 days if the Governor calls upon the Legislature to reconsider the order and changed 
18 circumstances.
19Sec. 3.  37-B MRSA §742, sub-§1, ¶F is enacted to read:
20 F.  After 7 days have elapsed from the issuance of an emergency proclamation by the 
21 Governor, all emergency powers revert to the Legislature. Emergency proclamations 
22 may be extended or discontinued by the Legislature pursuant to this paragraph.  
23 (1)  The Legislature may extend an emergency proclamation issued pursuant to this 
24 subsection up to a maximum of 30 days by a 2/3 majority vote in each House of 
25 the Legislature.  Additional 30-day extensions of the emergency proclamation may 
26 be approved, but only if done in compliance with this subparagraph.
27 (2)  Either House of the Legislature may terminate an emergency proclamation 
28 issued pursuant to this subsection, in whole or in part, by a majority vote.  
29 (3)  Debate and voting conducted pursuant to this paragraph by each House of the 
30 Legislature may be done remotely by electronic or other means as established by 
31 each House's rules, or in the absence of such rules, as specified by the presiding 
32 officer of each House.
33Sec. 4.  37-B MRSA §742, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2019, c. 617, Pt. A, §1 and 
34 Pt. H, §1, is further amended by enacting at the end a new first blocked paragraph to read:
35 It is an impeachable offense, punishable by removal from office and a lifetime prohibition 
36 on serving in any elected or appointed office in the State, for a Governor to exercise any 
37 emergency powers conferred by this subsection except as provided in this subsection.
38Sec. 5.  37-B MRSA §742, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:
391-A.  Limitation on emergency powers.  The exercise of any emergency power the 
40 Governor or other state or local official may have under the Constitution of Maine or the 
41 laws of this State that binds or regulates the public is limited as provided in this subsection.
Page 3 - 130LR0815(01)1 A.  As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following 
2 terms have the following meanings.
3 (1) "Emergency order" means an order, decree, regulation or other mandate 
4 proclaimed or promulgated by the Governor or a state or local official.
5 (2)  "State or local official" means the Governor, a person within the executive 
6 branch or an elected or appointed member of a municipal government.
7 B.  Notwithstanding subsection 1, paragraph D or any other law to the contrary, an 
8 emergency order that is issued by a state or local official that binds, curtails or infringes 
9 the rights of private parties must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling health or 
10 safety purpose. Each emergency order must be limited in duration, applicability and 
11 scope in order to reduce any infringement of individual liberty.
12 C.  A court of this State has jurisdiction to hear a case challenging the legality of an 
13 emergency order, including compliance with the limitations imposed on emergency 
14 orders pursuant to this subsection.  A court shall expedite consideration of a challenge 
15 brought pursuant to this paragraph to the extent practicable. Inequality in the 
16 applicability of the impact of emergency orders on analogous groups, situations and 
17 circumstances may constitute one ground among others for a court to invalidate or 
18 enjoin an emergency order, or some of its applications, on the basis that it is not 
19 narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose.
20SUMMARY
21 This bill places limitations on the powers of the Governor to issue and maintain powers 
22 pursuant to an emergency proclamation, including:
23 1.  Limiting the length of the time period of an emergency proclamation to 7 days;
24 2.  Requiring an extension of an emergency proclamation beyond 7 days to be approved 
25 by a 2/3 vote of each House of the Legislature;
26 3.  Allowing the Senate or House, individually, by a majority vote, to discontinue an 
27 emergency proclamation;
28 4.  Prohibiting the Governor, during a state of emergency, from reissuing or renewing 
29 an emergency proclamation, issuing a similar proclamation to one that has expired or 
30 reissuing an emergency proclamation that the Legislature has discontinued; and
31 5.  Providing that a violation by the Governor of the exercise of emergency powers is 
32 an impeachable offense.
33 This bill allows the Legislature to debate and vote by remote or other electronic means 
34 on the extension or discontinuation of a Governor's emergency proclamation.  
35 This bill also requires the emergency powers exercised by the Governor, a person 
36 within the executive branch or a municipal official that bind, curtail or infringe on the rights 
37 of private parties to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling health or safety purpose and 
38 to be limited in duration, applicability and scope to reduce any infringement of individual 
39 liberty.
40 Finally, this bill gives a state court jurisdiction to hear a case challenging the legality 
41 of the exercise of emergency powers and requires the court to expedite consideration of the 21
22
Page 4 - 130LR0815(01)42 case to the extent practicable.  Inequality in the applicability of impact of emergency orders 
43 on analogous groups, situations and circumstances may constitute one ground among 
44 others for a court to invalidate or enjoin an emergency order, or some of its applications, 
45 on the basis that it is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety 
46 purpose.1
