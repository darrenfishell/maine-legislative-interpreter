9 regarding the sale and marketing of travel insurance and travel protection plans, the 
10 provisions of this chapter control.
112.  Deceptive travel insurance.  Offering or selling a travel insurance policy that could 
12 never result in payment of any claims for any insured under the policy is an unfair trade 
13 practice under chapter 23.

15 comply with the marketing requirements in this subsection.
16 A.  All documents provided to consumers prior to the purchase of travel insurance,

29 trip or filed a claim under the travel insurance coverage, a primary policyholder or 
30 primary certificate holder may cancel a policy or certificate for a full refund of the 
31 travel protection plan price from the date of purchase of a travel protection plan until 
32 at least:
33 (1)  Fifteen days following the date of delivery of the travel protection plan's

36 fulfillment materials by means other than mail.
37 For the purposes of this paragraph, "delivery" means handing fulfillment materials to 
38 the primary policyholder or primary certificate holder or sending fulfillment materials 
39 by mail or electronic means to the primary policyholder or primary certificate holder.
40 D.  The insurer shall disclose in the policy documentation and fulfillment materials 
41 whether the travel insurance is primary or secondary to other applicable coverage.
42 E.  When travel insurance is marketed directly to a consumer through an insurer's 
43 website or by others through an aggregator site, it is not an unfair trade practice or other 
Page 9 - 130LR0556(01)44 violation of law for an accurate summary or short description of coverage to be 
45 provided on the website or through an aggregator site, so long as the consumer has 
46 access to the full provisions of the policy through electronic means.
44.  Opt-out format.  A person offering, soliciting or negotiating travel insurance or 
5 travel protection plans on an individual or group basis may not do so by using a negative 
6 option or opt-out format that requires a consumer to take an affirmative action to deselect 
7 coverage, such as unchecking a box on an electronic form, when the consumer purchases 
8 a trip.
95.  Blanket travel insurance.  It is an unfair trade practice to market blanket travel 
10 insurance coverage as free.
116.  Jurisdiction dictating coverage.  When a consumer's destination jurisdiction 
12 requires insurance coverage, it is not an unfair trade practice to require that a consumer 
13 choose between the following options as a condition of purchasing a trip or travel package:
14 A.  Purchasing the coverage required by the destination jurisdiction through the travel 
15 retailer or supervising travel insurance producer supplying the trip or travel package; 
16 or
17 B.  Agreeing to obtain and provide proof of coverage that meets the destination 
18 jurisdiction's requirements prior to departure.

25 permitted under that producer license;
26 B.  Holds a valid managing general agent license in the State; or
27 C.  Holds a valid 3rd-party administrator license in the State.
282.  Exemption from adjuster license requirements.  A travel administrator and its 
29 employees are exempt from the licensing requirements for adjusters in chapter 16 for travel 
30 insurance the travel administrator administers.
313.  Insurer responsible.  An insurer is responsible for the acts of a travel administrator 
32 administering travel insurance underwritten by the insurer, including any affiliate of the 
33 insurer acting as a travel administrator for the direct and assumed insurance business of the 
34 affiliated insurer, and is responsible for ensuring that the travel administrator maintains all 
35 books and records relevant to the insurer to be made available by the travel administrator
