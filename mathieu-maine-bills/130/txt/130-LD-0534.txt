Page 1 - 130LR1848(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง841, sub-ยง2-A is enacted to read:
32-A.  Destruction of property.  The assessors, either upon written application or on 
4 their own initiative, may make such reasonable abatement as they consider proper to reflect 
5 the diminishment of the value of assessed real property due to its destruction after April 1st 
6 of the property tax year for which abatement is requested.  A taxpayer seeking an abatement 
7 pursuant to this subsection must file a written application requesting abatement within 12 
8 months from the date of the destruction of the property stating the grounds for abatement.  
9 For purposes of this subsection, "destruction" means damage to real property from flood, 
10 fire, explosion or natural disaster that reduces the just value of the improvements on the 
11 property by at least 50%.
12Sec. 2.  Application. This Act applies to property tax years beginning on or after 
13 April 1, 2022.
14SUMMARY
15 This bill allows municipal assessors, or the State Tax Assessor for property in the

17 by flood, fire, explosion or natural disaster, suffers at least a 50% decrease in just value to
