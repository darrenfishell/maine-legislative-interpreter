17 member's creditable service in the capacity specified in Title 5, section 17851-A, 
18 subsection 1, paragraph Q, regardless of when that creditable service was earned, except 
19 that for a member qualifying for a retirement benefit under Title 5, section 17851-A, 
20 subsection 2, paragraph B:
21 1.  If the member had 10 years of creditable service on July 1, 1993, the benefit must

23 year the member's age precedes 55 years of age; or
24 2.  If the member had fewer than 10 years of creditable service on July 1, 1993, the 
25 benefit must be reduced by 6% for each year that the member's age precedes 55 years of 
26 age.

31 unit prior to October 1, 2021.
