SUMMARY 
This amendment establishes a tariff rate applicable to distributed generation resources 
that do not qualify for the tariff rate under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 
3209-B, subsection 5, paragraph A. The amendment limits the applicability of the tariff 
rate under paragraph A to distributed generation resources with a nameplate capacity of 
one megawatt or less and distributed generation resources with a nameplate capacity over 
one megawatt that are collocated with net energy billing customers subscribed to at least 
50% of the facility's output or that have certified that the resources have commenced 
physical work of a significant nature before September 1, 2022. 
The amendment also provides that a distributed generation resource with a nameplate 
capacity of greater than 2 megawatts and not more than 5 megawatts may be used for net 
energy billing if certain requirements are met. 
The amendment also replaces the term "competitive service provider" with 
"competitive electricity provider" in the laws governing the Public Utilities Commission.
