Page 1 - 130LR1841(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  32 MRSA ยง1408 is enacted to read:
3ยง1408.  Vehicle safety
4 A member of the funeral service profession or an authorized representative or 
5 employee of a member of the funeral service profession who owns or leases a vehicle used

102.  Floor or platform secured to vehicle.  When a floor or platform is installed in the

12 platform cannot become dislodged in the event of a vehicle accident.
133.  System to secure containers.  A functioning system to ensure that a container 
14 within the vehicle cannot become dislodged in the event of a vehicle accident must be

17 The owner or lessee of a vehicle that violates this section is subject to a civil penalty 
18 of not less than $5,000.  If a violation of this section is a cause of serious bodily injury or

20 $25,000 and the violation must be a factor in assessment of criminal liability pursuant to 
21 Title 17-A, section 60.
22SUMMARY
23 Current law does not require that vehicles used in the funeral industry to transport 
24 human remains contain certain safety features to prevent harm to persons riding in the 
25 vehicles when floors or platforms are installed and when containers are being transported.  
26 This bill requires a floor or platform installed in a vehicle to be lower than the vehicle's 
27 front seats and to be secured to the vehicle so it cannot become dislodged in the event of a 
28 vehicle accident and requires a functioning system to be installed in the vehicle to ensure 
29 that a container within the vehicle cannot become dislodged in the event of a vehicle 
30 accident.  It provides that a member of the funeral service profession or authorized 
31 representative or employee who owns or leases a vehicle used to transport human remains 
32 may not operate that vehicle unless it meets these requirements, that the owner or lessee of 
33 such a vehicle that violates these requirements is subject to a civil penalty of not less than 
34 $5,000 and that an owner or lessee that violates these requirements is subject to a civil 
35 penalty of $25,000 if the violation is a cause of serious bodily injury or death of another 
36 person, with the violation being a factor in assessment of criminal liability.23
