Page 1 - 130LR2578(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the existing Probate Court system established pursuant to the Constitution 
4 of Maine, Article VI, Section 6 was conditionally repealed by a vote of the people of Maine 
5 in 1967; and
6Whereas, the effective date of the repeal was dependent on the establishment of a 
7 different Probate Court system with full-time judges by the Legislature; and
8Whereas, this legislation implements the recommendations of the Commission To 
9 Create a Plan To Incorporate the Probate Courts into the Judicial Branch, which was 
10 established by Resolve 2021, chapter 104 to honor the intent of a long-standing vote of 
11 Maine people and directed to create a plan for a Probate Court system with full-time judges; 
12 and
13Whereas, enactment of this legislation will trigger the repeal of the Constitution of 
14 Maine, Article VI, Section 6, which provides for the election of county probate judges and 
15 county registers of probate, some of whom are subject to primary and general elections this 
16 year; and
17Whereas, it is therefore necessary to clarify the statutory processes by which probate 
18 court judges and registers of probate are selected before the date of the June 14, 2022 
19 primary; and
20Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
21 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
22 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
23 therefore,

31 7, 1967.   It is the intent of the Legislature that the enactment of this Act, which creates a

9 expense of the Probate Court; 
1011.  Development and implementation of administrative concepts.  Carry on a 
11 continuous survey and study of the organization, operation, condition of business, practice

13 Supreme Judicial Court concerning the number of judges and other personnel, other than 
14 personnel in the county registries of probate, required for the efficient administration of 
15 justice and examine, with the advice of the Probate Court Judges and Registers of Probate, 
16 the status of dockets of the various Probate Courts to determine whether the business of the 
17 court is being carried out in an efficient manner and that emergency matters are prioritized 
18 and addressed expediently.  From such an examination, the Chief Judge shall annually 
19 make recommendations to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court for guidelines 
20 and policies for the scheduling and trial of matters before the Probate Court.  In providing 
21 recommendations, the Chief Judge shall give due and appropriate regard to the

35 and defined as follows:
36 A. Region 1 consists of York County;
37 B. Region 2 consists of Cumberland County;
38 C. Region 3 consists of Oxford, Franklin and Androscoggin counties;
39 D. Region 4 consists of Kennebec and Somerset counties;
40 E. Region 5 consists of Penobscot and Piscataquis counties;
41 F. Region 6 consists of Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Knox and Waldo counties;
42 G. Region 7 consists of Hancock and Washington counties; and
Page 35 - 130LR2578(01)1 H. Region 8 consists of Aroostook County.
22. Assignment.  The Chief Judge of the Probate Court shall assign at least one Probate 
3 Court Judge as the primary judge to hold court in each region.
43. Place for holding court.  In each county within each region, the Chief Judge of the 
5 Probate Court shall designate a place for holding court that is located, to the extent possible 
6 given the other requirements of this subsection, in the building holding the office of that 
7 county's Register of Probate.  The Chief Judge, with the advice and approval of the 
8 Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of General Services, is 
9 empowered to negotiate on behalf of the State the leases, contracts and other arrangements 
10 the Chief Judge considers necessary, within the limits of the budget and funds available, to 
11 provide suitable quarters, adequately furnished and equipped for the Probate Court in each 
12 county.  
13 If the Chief Judge is unable to negotiate the leases, contracts and other arrangements as 
14 provided in this subsection, the Chief Judge may, with the advice and approval of the 
15 Bureau of General Services, negotiate on behalf of the State the leases, contracts and other 
16 arrangements the Chief Judge considers necessary, within the limits of the budget and funds 
17 available, to provide suitable quarters, adequately furnished and equipped for the Probate 
18 Court in other publicly owned or privately owned buildings.
194. Exception; Aroostook County.  Notwithstanding subsection 3, the Chief Judge of 
20 the Probate Court shall secure facilities for the Probate Court in Region 8 to hold court at 
21 least 2 times each year at Fort Kent and at least 4 times each year at Caribou. The time for 
22 holding the court must be appointed by the Chief Judge of the Probate Court and made 
23 known by public notification as provided in section 415.
245. Exception; alternative locations.  Notwithstanding subsection 3, the Probate Court 
25 may hold hearings for matters in equity and contested cases at such time and place in the 
26 county as the Probate Court may appoint and make all necessary orders and decrees relating 
27 thereto.
28§414.  Officers execute processes and attend courts
29 Sheriffs, their deputies and constables shall execute all legal processes directed to them 
30 by a Probate Court, which may, when necessary, require such officer, when not in 
31 attendance upon any other court, to attend during the sitting of the Probate Court, for which 
32 that officer must be paid as in other courts for similar services. 
33§415.  Continuous session; return day for matters requiring public notice
34 The Probate Court is always open in each county for all matters over which it has 
35 jurisdiction, except upon days on which by law no court is held, but it shall have certain 
36 fixed days and places to be made known by public notification thereof in their respective 
37 counties to which all matters requiring public notice must be made returnable, except as 
38 otherwise ordered by the Chief Judge of the Probate Court. In case of the absence of the 
39 assigned Probate Court Judge at the time of holding any court, the Register of Probate or 
40 acting register may adjourn the same unless the Chief Judge of the Probate Court assigns 
41 another Probate Court Judge to attend. 
42§416.  Conflict of interest; transfer of proceeding
Page 36 - 130LR2578(01)11.  Probate Court Judge conflict of interest.  When a Probate Court Judge is 
2 interested in that judge's own right in a trust that is not fully executed, or in any other 
3 manner in an estate, or is within the degree of kindred by which in law that judge may, by 
4 possibility, be heir to any part of the estate of the person deceased, or is named as executor, 
5 trustee of a trust that is not fully executed or guardian of minor children in the will of any 
6 deceased resident of the county, the judge must be recused from any proceedings related to 
7 the trust or settlement of the estate unless said disability is removed.  
8 This subsection may not be construed to require recusal by a Probate Court Judge who is 
9 named as executor, trustee or guardian of minor children in a will if the judge does not 
10 receive a benefit from the will and the record of the court discloses the filing of the judge's 
11 declination to act as such executor, trustee or guardian and if no objection is raised by any 
12 interested party at the hearing on the petition for probate of the will.
132. Probate Court Judge not to draft documents.  A Probate Court Judge may not 
14 draft or aid in drafting any document or paper that the Probate Court Judge is by law 
15 required to pass upon. 
163. Register of Probate conflict of interest; transfer of proceeding.  When a Register 
17 of Probate is interested in that register's own right in a trust that is not fully executed, or in 
18 any other manner in an estate, or is within the degree of kindred by which in law that 
19 register may, by possibility, be heir to any part of the estate of the person deceased, or is 
20 named as executor, trustee of a trust that is not fully executed or guardian of minor children 
21 in the will of any deceased resident of the county, such estate must be settled in the Probate 
22 Court of any adjoining county, which has full jurisdiction thereof as if the deceased had 
23 died in that adjoining county.  If the register's interest arises after jurisdiction over such 
24 estate has been assumed or existed at the time of the register's election to office, and in all 
25 cases where an executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, whose trust is not fully 
26 executed, becomes the Register of Probate for the county in which that register's letters 
27 were granted, further proceedings must be transferred to the Probate Court in any adjoining 
28 county and there remain until completed, unless said disability is removed before that time. 
29 Whenever in any case within this subsection the disability of the Register of Probate is 
30 removed before the proceedings have been fully completed, the proceedings must then be 
31 transferred to the Probate Court in the county of original jurisdiction or to the Probate Court 
32 that otherwise would have had jurisdiction. In all such cases the register in such adjoining 
33 county shall transmit copies of all records relating to such estate to the probate office of the 
34 county where such estate belongs, to be there recorded.
35 This subsection may not be construed to require removal to another county by reason of 
36 the Register of Probate having been named as executor, trustee or guardian of minor 
37 children in a will, if the register does not receive a benefit from the will and the record of 
38 the court discloses the filing of the register's declination to act as such executor, trustee or 
39 guardian and if no objection is raised by any interested party at the hearing on the petition 
40 for probate of the will.
41§417. Rights of claimants under heir
42 Any person claiming under an heir at law has the same rights as the heir in all 
43 proceedings in Probate Court, including rights of appeal.
44§418. Perpetual care of cemetery lots by order
Page 37 - 130LR2578(01)1 In any case in which an estate is under the Probate Court's jurisdiction for probate, the 
2 Probate Court may order that an appropriate amount out of the estate be set aside for 
3 perpetual care and suitable memorials for the cemetery lot in which the deceased is buried 
4 and order special care of such lots when the conditions and size of the estate seem to warrant 
5 such order.
6§419. Contracts for support
71.  Approval required.  All contracts for support for life must be approved by the 
8 Probate Court in the county in which the support for life is to be rendered. The Probate 
9 Court shall grant approval after such reasonable notice as the court determines to be 
10 appropriate, if the court finds, after hearing, that the contract is just and equitable under all 
11 of the circumstances.
122.  Admissibility in evidence.  A contract or agreement for support for life that has not 
13 been approved under subsection 1 may not be received in evidence unless the person 
14 offering the contract or agreement establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
15 contract or agreement is just and equitable under all of the circumstances.
163. Exception.  This section does not apply to contracts or agreements for support for 
17 life between persons related within the 3rd degree.
18§420. Commission To Evaluate the Incorporation of the Probate Court into the 
19Judicial Branch

12SUMMARY
13 This bill implements the recommendations of the Commission To Create a Plan To 
14 Incorporate the Probate Courts into the Judicial Branch, referred to in this summary as "the 
15 commission."  The report is available online at https://legislature.maine.gov/doc/7703.
16 Maine's county Probate Courts occupy a unique position in Maine's justice system. 
17 Unlike Maine's other trial courts, Probate Courts are not part of the state judicial branch 
18 and Probate Court Judges are not appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the 
19 Legislature.  Instead, pursuant to the former Constitution of Maine, Article VI, Section 6, 
20 Probate Court Judges and Registers of Probate are elected to 4-year terms in each county.  
21 Although the caseload varies from county to county, it is generally understood that Maine's 
22 county Probate Court Judges serve on a part-time basis and, accordingly, they are 
23 authorized to engage in the practice of law. 
24 In 1967, the Legislature passed Resolve 1967, chapter 77, which proposed an 
25 amendment to the Constitution of Maine that would repeal Article VI, Section 6 and would 
26 "become effective at such time as the Legislature by proper enactment shall establish a 
27 different Probate Court system with full-time judges."  This constitutional amendment was 
28 approved by a majority of the voters of Maine on November 7, 1967.  In its report, the 
29 commission recommended that the Legislature implement this constitutional amendment 
30 by establishing a new state Probate Court with full-time, appointed state Probate Court 
31 Judges.  Part A of the bill sets out that it is the intent of the Legislature that the enactment 
32 of this legislation, which implements the commission's recommended new Probate Court 
33 system with full-time judges, will trigger the repeal of the Constitution of Maine, Article 
34 VI, Section 6 pursuant to Resolve 1967, chapter 77 on the date that this emergency 
35 legislation is approved.
36 Although this bill is intended to trigger the repeal of the Constitution of Maine, Article 
37 VI, Section 6, which provides for the election of probate judges, the commission did not 
38 recommend and the bill does not provide for the removal from office of any county Probate 
39 Court Judge prior to the expiration of the term to which the judge was previously elected 
40 under the Constitution.  To avoid that result, the commission recommended a multiyear, 
41 multistep process for establishing a new state Probate Court with full-time judges.  Part B 
42 of the bill, which is effective immediately, Part C of the bill, which is effective January 1, 1
2
3
13
14
15
Page 41 - 130LR2578(01)43 2023, and Part D of the bill, which is effective January 1, 2025, implement this multiyear, 
44 multistep process as follows. 
3 1.  Parts B and D of the bill establish a state Probate Court within the judicial branch 
4 that is distinct from the District Court and Superior Court.  By January 1, 2025, the state 
5 Probate Court will be staffed by 9 full-time judges appointed by the Governor and 
6 confirmed by the Legislature, including one judge assigned to serve as the primary judge 
7 in each of 8 new Probate Court regions that will be aligned with the State's 8 prosecutorial 
8 districts.
9 A. When the terms of the incumbent probate judges in Androscoggin, Franklin, Knox 
10 and Penobscot counties expire on December 31, 2022, they will be replaced by county 
11 Probate Court Judges elected to 2-year terms that will expire on December 31, 2024.  
12 Because the ballot-qualification process has already commenced, Part B of the bill 
13 provides that signatures collected by a candidate on a petition to qualify to appear on 
14 the primary or general election ballot for a county probate judge position established 
15 by the Constitution of Maine, Article VI, Section 6 in one of these counties are deemed 
16 to be signatures collected for that candidate to appear on the primary or general election 
17 ballot for the 2-year statutory Probate Court Judge positions established in the bill for 
18 that county.
19 B.  When the terms of the incumbent probate judges in Cumberland, Hancock and 
20 Washington counties expire on December 31, 2022, they will be replaced by 4 new 
21 state Probate Court Judges appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Legislature 
22 in the same manner that District Court Judges and Superior Court Justices are appointed 
23 and confirmed for terms that commence January 1, 2023.  Although not reflected in the 
24 text of the bill, the commission also recommended that these judges be supported by 
25 one new law clerk, one new judicial administrative assistant and 4 new court marshals.
26 C.  Beginning January 1, 2023, the 4 new state Probate Court Judges will preside over 
27 probate proceedings in Cumberland, Hancock and Washington counties while the 
28 remainder of the State's 16 counties will continue to be served by an elected county 
29 Probate Court Judge.  If a judicial vacancy occurs in a county Probate Court after 
30 January 1, 2023 due to the death, resignation or retirement of the elected county Probate 
31 Court Judge, the vacant position will not be filled and jurisdiction over that county's 
32 probate matters will be transferred to the new state Probate Court.  If the Chief Justice 
33 of the Supreme Judicial Court determines that the number of state Probate Court Judges 
34 is insufficient to provide for the efficient administration of justice in all of the counties 
35 served by the new state Probate Court, the Chief Justice may request that the Governor 
36 appoint an additional state Probate Court Judge.  Although not reflected in the text of 
37 the bill, to ensure that funding is available for all of the new potential state judgeships 
38 as they arise, the commission also recommended that all 9 new state Probate Court 
39 Judge positions be funded through General Fund appropriations commencing on 
40 January 1, 2023.
41 D. When the terms of all remaining county Probate Court Judges expire on December 
42 31, 2024, they will be replaced by the number of new state Probate Court Judges 
43 necessary to achieve a full complement of 9 state Probate Court Judges.  Although not 
44 reflected in the text of the bill, the commission also recommended that these new judges 
45 be supported by a 2nd law clerk and judicial administrative assistant and by 5 additional 
46 court marshals.1
2
Page 42 - 130LR2578(01)1 E.  Although not reflected in the text of the bill, the commission also recommended 
2 that the judicial branch be authorized to hire an information technology specialist and 
3 a facilities manager as soon as possible, and that General Fund appropriations be 
4 provided for that purpose, to help the judicial branch prepare for the establishment of 
5 the state Probate Court on January 1, 2023.
6 2.  Parts B, C and D of the bill direct the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court 
7 to designate one appointed state Probate Court Judge to serve as the Chief Judge of the 
8 Probate Court, who is charged with fulfilling administrative duties similar to the 
9 administrative duties of the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and Chief Judge of the 
10 District Court.  These duties include facilitating the transition from the county Probate 
11 Court system to the state Probate Court system; creating the statewide Probate Court 
12 schedule; ensuring uniformity of court processes and procedures and that emergency 
13 matters are prioritized and addressed expediently; securing and ensuring the accessibility 
14 and safety of Probate Court facilities; and preparing annual reports on the business of the 
15 state Probate Court.
16 3. Parts C and D of the bill direct that state Probate Court proceedings be held in 
17 existing county Probate Court facilities if possible and require the Chief Judge of the 
18 Probate Court to negotiate leases, contracts or other arrangements between the counties and 
19 the judicial branch regarding the use of those facilities. When necessary, state District Court 
20 and Superior Court facilities may also be used for Probate Court proceedings.
21 4. Parts B, C and D of the bill preserve the county registries of probate. 
22 A.  Part B of the bill provides, by statute, for the election of county Registers of Probate 
23 under the same terms and conditions applicable to county register of probate elections 
24 under the Constitution of Maine, Article VI, Section 6, which will be repealed on the 
25 date that this emergency legislation is approved.  Because the ballot-qualification 
26 process has already commenced, Part B of the bill provides that signatures collected 
27 by a candidate on a petition to qualify to appear on the primary or general election 
28 ballot this year for a register of probate position established by the Constitution of 
29 Maine, Article VI, Section 6 are deemed to be signatures collected for that candidate 
30 to appear on the primary or general election ballot this year for the same Register of 
31 Probate position established in the bill by statute.
32 B.  Parts B, C and D of the bill further provide that, as each county transitions to the 
33 state Probate Court, that county should continue to retain all fees filed in state Probate 
34 Court proceedings in that county to offset the costs of maintaining its county registry 
35 of probate and of paying registry staff.  These costs include, for example, the cost to 
36 maintain the current electronic management system for probate court records that the 
37 commission recommended retaining during the multiyear transition to the new state 
38 Probate Court system.
39 5. Part C of the bill provides that, beginning January 1, 2023, the Maine Commission 
40 on Indigent Legal Services is responsible for paying and for establishing the minimum 
41 experience, training and additional qualifications for attorneys appointed to represent 
42 indigent individuals at public expense in all state and county Probate Court proceedings.  
43 Although not reflected in the text of the bill, the commission further recommended that the 
44 Legislature provide new General Fund appropriations to the Maine Commission on 
45 Indigent Legal Services to cover the cost of these appointments.
Page 43 - 130LR2578(01)1 6. Parts C and D of the bill require the judicial branch to establish the minimum 
2 experience, training and additional qualifications for court-appointed visitors in state 
3 Probate Court proceedings and to pay the expenses of both court-appointed visitors and 
4 court-appointed guardians ad litem in state Probate Court proceedings when the parties are 
5 indigent or the court is allowed or directed by law to pay these expenses.  Although not 
6 reflected in the text of the bill, the commission recommended that the Legislature provide 
7 new General Fund appropriations to the judicial branch to cover the expenses associated 
8 with the new requirements.  Part C of the bill clarifies that, if a guardian ad litem or visitor 
9 is appointed at public expense in a county Probate Court proceeding, the county remains 
10 responsible for paying the court-appointed professional's fees.
11 7.  Finally, Part D of the bill establishes the Commission To Evaluate the Incorporation 
12 of the Probate Court into the Judicial Branch, a 15-member study group composed of the 
13 same categories of members appointed to the Commission To Create a Plan To Incorporate 
14 the Probate Courts into the Judicial Branch.  Part D of the bill directs the new commission 
15 to conduct a thorough review of the new state Probate Court system in 2027, which must 
16 include, but is not limited to, evaluating whether the number of supported state Probate 
17 Court Judge positions proposed is appropriate or should be adjusted; whether the 
18 jurisdiction of the state Probate Court, District Court and Superior Court should be adjusted 
19 to increase judicial efficiency and access to justice; whether to authorize assignment of 
20 state Probate Court Judges to preside over District Court or Superior Court dockets to the 
21 same extent that the judges in the District Court and justices in the Superior Court are 
22 available for cross assignments; whether additional investments should be made to enhance 
23 the compatibility of the Probate Court and judicial branch electronic case management 
24 systems; and whether additional opportunities exist to advance toward the ultimate goal of 
25 fully incorporating the Probate Court system into the judicial branch.  No later than 
26 December 31, 2027, the commission is required to submit a report that includes its findings 
27 and recommendations, which may include suggested legislation, for presentation to the 
28 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters.  The 
29 joint standing committee may report out legislation related to the report to the 133rd 
30 Legislature.
