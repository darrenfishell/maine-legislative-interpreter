31 This bill requires that any meeting between a school board and representatives of public 
32 employees that is requested by representatives of the employees must occur at a regularly 
33 scheduled school board meeting and that public notice must be given at least 10 days prior 
34 to the school board meeting.  The bill also provides that negotiations between a school 
35 board and representatives of public employees regarding personnel matters may not be 
36 open to the public and must be held in executive session.  This is an exception to current 
37 law, which allows negotiations between the representatives of a public employer and public 
38 employees to be open to the public if both parties agree to conduct negotiations in open 
39 sessions.31
