16SUMMARY
17 This bill implements some of the recommendations of Resolve 2019, chapter 79 
18 directing the Commissioner of Professional and Financial Regulation to form a working 
19 group to assess barriers to professional licensure for skilled individuals with foreign 
20 credentials and licensees of other states who apply for Maine licensure.

22 the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation to exercise discretionary 
23 authority, after consultation with licensing entities, to waive documentation requirements 
24 for licensure submitted by applicants educated in or with relevant experience or licensure 
25 in other jurisdictions, including other states, United States territories, foreign nations and 
26 foreign administrative divisions, as long as the waiver does not reduce the requisite 
27 standards of proficiency for the licensed profession or occupation.  It allows the director to 
28 exercise discretionary authority to waive examination fees and license fees for applicants 
29 for licensure educated in or with relevant experience or licensure in other jurisdictions, 
30 including other states, United States territories, foreign nations and foreign administrative 
31 divisions.  It also allows the office, or a licensing board or commission within the office, 
32 to grant provisional licenses to applicants educated in or with relevant experience or 
33 licensure in other jurisdictions, including other states, United States territories, foreign 
34 nations and foreign administrative divisions.  It provides the director with rule-making 
35 authority to implement these discretionary authorities.
36 It provides the director with the authority to adopt rules to define the term "jurisdiction" 
37 for licensing purposes to mean a state, a United States territory, a foreign nation or a foreign 
38 administrative division that issues a license or credential.
39 It provides the director with the authority to accept funds from the Federal Government, 
40 from any political subdivision of the State or from any individual, foundation or 
41 corporation, to expend those funds for purposes consistent with the purposes of the Maine 
42 Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 8003 and to provide grants to nongovernmental entities 
43 for purposes consistent with that law.
