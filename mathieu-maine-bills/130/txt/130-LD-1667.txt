29 to implement the Educational Certificate Tax Credit Program established under Title 20-
30 A, chapter 441.

93.  Calculation of the credit; qualified individuals.  Subject to subsection 2 and 
10 except as provided in this subsection, the credit with respect to a qualified individual is 
11 equal to the lesser of:
12 A. The benchmark loan payment multiplied by the number of months during the 
13 taxable year in which the taxpayer made loan payments; and
14 B. The monthly loan payment amount multiplied by the number of months during the 
15 taxable year in which the taxpayer made loan payments.
16 The credit under this subsection is refundable to the extent the credit is based on loans 
17 included in the financial aid package acquired to obtain a certificate.
184.  Calculation of the credit; employers.  Subject to subsection 2, a taxpayer 
19 constituting an employer making loan payments directly to a lender during the taxable year 
20 on loans included in a qualified employee's financial aid package may claim a credit equal 
21 to the actual monthly loan payment made by the employer on the loans multiplied by the 
22 number of months during the taxable year the employer made loan payments on behalf of 
23 the qualified employee during the term of employment.  The credit under this subsection 
24 may not be claimed with respect to months of the taxable year during which the employee 
25 was not a qualified employee.
26 If the qualified employee is employed on a part-time basis during the taxable year, the 
27 credit with respect to that employee is limited to 50% of the credit otherwise determined 
28 under this subsection.
