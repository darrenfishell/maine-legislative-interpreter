41.  Mandatory testing program established.  The department shall establish a testing 
5 program for harvested marijuana.  Except as otherwise provided in this section or in rules 
6 adopted pursuant to this section, the program must require a registered caregiver, 
7 dispensary or manufacturing facility, prior to selling or distributing harvested marijuana to 
8 a qualifying patient or to another registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility, 
9 to submit the harvested marijuana to a testing facility licensed pursuant to Title 28-B, 
10 chapter 1 for testing to ensure that the harvested marijuana does not exceed the maximum 
11 level of allowable contamination for any contaminant that is injurious to health and for 
12 which testing is required and to ensure correct labeling. 
132.  Scope of mandatory testing; record keeping; processes, protocols and 
14standards.  A registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility may not sell or 
15 distribute harvested marijuana to a qualifying patient or caregiver or to another registered 
16 caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility under this section unless the harvested 
17 marijuana has been tested pursuant to this section and the rules adopted pursuant to this 
18 section and that mandatory testing has demonstrated that the tested harvested marijuana 
19 does not exceed the maximum level of allowable contamination for any contaminant that 
20 is injurious to health and for which testing is required.
21 A.  Mandatory testing of harvested marijuana under this section must include, but is 
22 not limited to, testing for:

29 (6) THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, potency, homogeneity and cannabinoid profiles 
30 to ensure correct labeling.
31 The department may temporarily waive mandatory testing requirements under this 
32 paragraph for any contaminant or factor for which the department has determined that 
33 there exists no testing facility licensed pursuant to Title 28-B, chapter 1 in the State 
34 capable of and certified to perform such testing.
35 B.  A registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility shall maintain a record 
36 of all mandatory testing under this section that includes a description of the harvested 
37 marijuana provided to the testing facility, the identity of the testing facility and the 
38 results of the mandatory test.
39 C.  The department shall establish by rule processes, protocols and standards for 
40 mandatory and other testing of harvested marijuana that conform with the best practices 
41 generally used within the marijuana industry.
Page 2 - 130LR0856(01)13.  Notification requirements.  Testing facilities are required to notify the department 
2 of test results on harvested marijuana as follows.
3 A.  If the results of a mandatory test conducted pursuant to subsection 2 indicate that 
4 the tested harvested marijuana exceeds the maximum level of allowable contamination 
5 for any contaminant that is injurious to health and for which testing is required, the 
6 testing facility immediately shall notify the department and the registered caregiver, 
7 dispensary or manufacturing facility that submitted the sample for testing of the failed 
8 mandatory test.  If a registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility 
9 successfully undertakes remediation and retesting of harvested marijuana that 
10 previously failed a mandatory test, the testing facility shall notify the department and 
11 the registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility of the test results of the 
12 retested harvested marijuana.
13 B.  A testing facility is not required to notify the department of the results of any test:
14 (1)  Conducted on harvested marijuana at the direction of a registered caregiver, 
15 dispensary or manufacturing facility pursuant to subsection 2 that demonstrates 
16 that the harvested marijuana does not exceed the maximum level of allowable 
17 contamination for any contaminant that is injurious to health and for which testing 
18 is required;
19 (2)  Conducted on harvested marijuana at the direction of a registered caregiver, 
20 dispensary or manufacturing facility for research and development purposes only, 
21 so long as the registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility notifies 
22 the testing facility prior to the performance of the test that the testing is for research 
23 and development purposes only; 
24 (3)  Conducted on harvested marijuana at the direction of a person who is not a 
25 registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility; or
26 (4)  Conducted on a substance that is not harvested marijuana.
274.  Sampling for testing.  A registered caregiver, an assistant of a registered caregiver, 
28 a dispensary, a manufacturing facility, a sample collector licensed pursuant to Title 28-B, 
29 chapter 1 or an employee of a sample collector or marijuana testing facility licensed 
30 pursuant to Title 28-B, chapter 1 may collect samples of harvested marijuana for mandatory 
31 testing.
32 A.  The department shall adopt rules regarding the collection of samples of harvested 
33 marijuana by a registered caregiver, an assistant of a registered caregiver, a dispensary, 
34 a manufacturing facility, a sample collector licensed pursuant to Title 28-B, chapter 1 
35 or an employee of a sample collector or marijuana testing facility licensed pursuant to 
36 Title 28-B, chapter 1 for mandatory testing as authorized under this subsection that 
37 must include, but are not limited to:
38 (1)  The establishment of sample collecting processes, protocols and standards, 
39 which must be complied with in collecting samples of harvested marijuana; 
40 (2)  Requirements for a demonstration to the department of sample collecting 
41 practices to ensure compliance with subparagraph (1);
42 (3)  Provisions authorizing the department to conduct audits of harvested marijuana 
43 that was tested using samples collected pursuant to this subsection, with all costs 
Page 3 - 130LR0856(01)44 of the audits to be paid by the registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing 
45 facility;
3 (4)  Requirements for the transportation, delivery and transfer of collected samples 
4 of harvested marijuana to a testing facility, which must require the in-person 
5 transfer of the collected samples; and
6 (5)  A prohibition on the intentional tampering with or interference in the 
7 mandatory testing process or auditing process, including failure of any audit 
8 conducted in accordance with subparagraph (3), by a registered caregiver, an 
9 assistant of a registered caregiver, a dispensary, a manufacturing facility, a sample 
10 collector or employee of a sample collector licensed pursuant to Title 28-B, chapter 
11 1 or a marijuana testing facility or employee of a marijuana testing facility licensed 
12 pursuant to Title 28-B, chapter 1, which, notwithstanding any provision of this 
13 chapter to the contrary, may be treated by the department as constituting a violation 
14 of program requirements and as a basis for imposition of a suspension, revocation 
15 or termination of a registry identification card or registration certificate, as 
16 applicable.
175.  Additional testing not required.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, a registered 
18 caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility may sell, transfer or otherwise furnish to a 
19 qualifying patient or caregiver or to another registered caregiver, dispensary or 
20 manufacturing facility harvested marijuana that the registered caregiver, dispensary or 
21 manufacturing facility has not submitted for testing in accordance with this section and 
22 rules adopted pursuant to this section if:
23 A.  The harvested marijuana has previously undergone testing in accordance with this 
24 section and rules adopted pursuant to this section at the direction of another registered 
25 caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility and that testing demonstrated that the 
26 harvested marijuana does not exceed the maximum level of allowable contamination 
27 for any contaminant that is injurious to health and for which testing is required;
28 B.  The mandatory testing process and the test results for the harvested marijuana are 
29 documented in accordance with this section and all applicable rules adopted pursuant 
30 to this section;
31 C.  Tracking from immature marijuana plant to the point of sale or transfer to a 
32 qualifying patient or caregiver on behalf of a qualifying patient has been maintained 
33 for the harvested marijuana, and transfers of the harvested marijuana to another 
34 registered caregiver, dispensary or manufacturing facility or to a qualifying patient or 
35 caregiver on behalf of a qualifying patient can be easily identified; and
36 D.  Since the performance of the prior testing under paragraph A, the harvested 
37 marijuana has not undergone any further processing, manufacturing or alteration other 
38 than the packaging and labeling of the harvested marijuana in accordance with this 
39 section and rules adopted pursuant to this section.
406.  Rulemaking.  The department shall adopt rules establishing a testing program 
41 pursuant to this section, including rules identifying the types of contaminants that are 
42 injurious to health for which harvested marijuana must be tested under this section, rules 
43 regarding the maximum level of allowable contamination for each contaminant, rules 
44 permitting the temporary or permanent waiver of mandatory testing for registered 1
