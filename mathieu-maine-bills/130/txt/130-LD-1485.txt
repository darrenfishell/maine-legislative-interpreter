34 campaign in towns or cities with a population of 15,000 or more, that organization must

40 the clerk in the subject municipality.  The commission retains the sole authority to prescribe 
41 the content of all reporting forms.  The commission does not have responsibility to oversee 
42 the filing of registrations or campaign finance reports relating to municipal campaigns.  If 
43 a municipal clerk becomes aware of a potential violation of this subchapter that the clerk 
44 considers to be substantial, the clerk may refer the matter to the commission for 
45 enforcement.  The commission may conduct an investigation if the information referred by 
Page 7 - 130LR1980(01)46 the municipal clerk shows sufficient grounds for believing that a violation may have 
47 occurred.  After conducting the investigation, if the commission determines that a violation 
48 of this subchapter has occurred, the commission may assess penalties provided in this 
49 subchapter.
5Sec. 4.  21-A MRSA §1054, as amended by PL 2019, c. 563, §7, is repealed and the

14 shall finance all of the committee’s expenditures to influence the election through the 
15 campaign account. If a business or corporate entity has established the committee, the 
16 campaign account must be segregated from the general treasury funds of the entity that 
17 established the committee.  If the committee is established by one or more individuals, the 
18 campaign account must be segregated from and not commingled with the personal funds 
19 of those individuals.
203.  Exceptions.  The commission may adopt procedures by rule for waiving the 
21 requirement under subsection 2 to maintain a segregated campaign account upon a showing 
22 by a committee that a separate account would be administratively burdensome, including 
23 but not limited to committees organized outside this State or an individual who registers as 
24 a ballot question committee. If the committee was formed by another organization, that 
25 other organization may pay its employees for their campaign-related activities on behalf of 
26 the committee through its own treasury, rather than the campaign account.

36 performance of these duties regardless of whether the treasurer has delegated 
37 administrative tasks related to these duties to another individual.

39 the principal officer are jointly responsible for the political action committee's compliance 
40 with the requirements of this chapter and the commission's rules.  The treasurer and

2 officer or primary decision maker of the political action committee and who has signed the 
3 acknowledgment statement required by section 1052‑A, subsection 4 is deemed to have

5 commission receives the individual's resignation statement or a notice of the individual's 
6 involuntary removal from the political action committee.
74.  Financial liability.  The commission may hold the treasurer and principal officer 
8 jointly and severally liable with the political action committee for any fines assessed against 
9 the political action committee for violations of this chapter and chapter 14.  In addition, the 
10 commission may assess all or part of a fine against any other agent of the political action 
11 committee who is directly responsible for a violation, including individuals who have 
12 resigned or have been removed involuntarily from the political action committee.  In 
13 deciding whether to assess a penalty against a treasurer, principal officer or any other 
14 individual, the commission may consider, among other things, whether the individual had

16 and whether the violation was intentional or caused by an error by a vendor or someone 
17 outside the control of the political action committee.
