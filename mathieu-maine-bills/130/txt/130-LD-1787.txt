Page 1 - 130LR2355(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current MaineCare reimbursement rates for services delivered by federally 
4 qualified health centers are based on costs of providing services 20 years ago and have not 
5 been adjusted sufficiently to keep pace with increases in the costs, intensity and scope of 
6 services offered; and
7Whereas, MaineCare reimbursement rates for services delivered by federally 
8 qualified health centers are substantially lower than the rates paid to certain primary care 
9 practices that offer fewer services and fewer programs designed to reduce the need for more 
10 expensive specialty and acute care than federally qualified health centers; and
11Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services is currently engaged in a 
12 process of radically revising its payment method for primary care services without 
13 considering the current inadequacy of federally qualified health center rates or the fact that 
14 federally qualified health centers are currently delivering many of the services and 
15 programs that the department is seeking to encourage by reforming its payment system; 
16 and
17Whereas, the current design of the department’s proposed payment reforms, which it 
18 intends to implement before the adjournment of the Second Regular Session of the 130th 
19 Legislature, will reduce payments to many federally qualified health centers; and
20Whereas, in order to preserve and improve the advanced primary care model 
21 pioneered by federally qualified health centers in Maine, MaineCare payments for those 
22 services must be increased in order to reflect the current costs of providing services before 
23 the department establishes an alternative payment model for federally qualified health 
24 centers; and
25Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
26 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
27 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
28 therefore,
29Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

9 payment system set forth in 42 United States Code, Section 1396a(bb)(3) is in effect.

17 C. Findings made by the department relating to the change in the scope of services 
18 provided by the federally qualified health center that consider:
19 (1) The costs arising from changes in the type, intensity, duration or quantity of 
20 services provided; and
21 (2) The costs arising from changes in the characteristics of the population receiving 
22 a service that affects the cost of the service; and
23 D. Additional costs retroactive to the date that the cost increases were first incurred by 
24 the federally qualified health center.
25Sec. 4.  22 MRSA §3174-V, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
265.  Alternative value-based payment.  The department may, subject to 42 United 
27 States Code, Section 1396a(bb)(6) and any other requirements under federal law, develop 
28 a value-based payment model to replace the prospective payment system set forth in 42 
29 United States Code, Section 1396a(bb)(3).  In developing a value-based payment model in 
30 accordance with this subsection, the department shall consult with federally qualified 
31 health centers in this State to the extent provided in 42 United States Code, Section 
32 1396a(bb)(6).
