29SUMMARY
30 This bill repeals ranked-choice voting in general elections for President of the United 
31 States and instead proposes to adopt an interstate compact to elect the President of the 
32 United States by national popular vote.  Under the compact, the presidential candidate who 
33 receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia is elected 
34 President.  Under the compact, all of a state's electoral votes would be awarded to the 
35 presidential candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District 
36 of Columbia.  The bill takes effect only if enacted by states possessing a majority of the 
37 electoral votes, that is, enough electoral votes to elect a President, which is 270 of 538.30
