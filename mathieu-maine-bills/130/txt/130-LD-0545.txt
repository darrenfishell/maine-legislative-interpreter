13 The purpose of this bill is to strengthen the criminal justice system's and human

15 prostitution or attempting to engage in prostitution with a person less than 18 years of age 
16 or a person believed by the actor to be less than 18 years of age.  In the Child and Family 
17 Services and Child Protection Act, the bill adds to the definition of "abuse or neglect" 
18 sexual exploitation of a minor, aggravated sex trafficking, sex trafficking and patronizing 
19 prostitution of a minor and to the definition of "aggravating factor" promotion of 
20 prostitution, patronizing prostitution of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, sex 
21 trafficking and aggravated sex trafficking, regardless of whether the actor has a familial 
22 relationship to the child.  The bill adds to the duties of the Department of Health and Human 
23 Services coordinating and providing care and services specialized to the needs of child 
24 victims of sexual exploitation and requires programs that provide services to have policies 
25 that screen for and respond to child sex trafficking.  The bill requires the Department of 
26 Health and Human Services to ensure that investigation and provision of care and services 
27 in cases related to child sex trafficking are specialized to the needs of child victims.  The 
28 bill adds to the duties of child advocacy centers, requiring a center to act as coordinator and 
29 provider of specialized services for child victims of sex trafficking.1
