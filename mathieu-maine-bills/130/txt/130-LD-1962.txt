5ยง9101.  High-impact Tutoring Grant Program Fund; standards; tutoring plan
61.  High-impact Tutoring Grant Program Fund.  The High-impact Tutoring Grant 
7 Program Fund, referred to in this chapter as "the fund," is established as a nonlapsing fund 
8 in the department to encourage the facilitation of so-called high-impact tutoring for local 
9 education providers throughout the State through the award of grants to eligible local 
10 education providers. The commissioner shall administer the fund.  For the purposes of this 
11 chapter, "local education provider" means a school administrative unit, a school in the 
12 unorganized territory pursuant to chapter 119, a public charter school pursuant to chapter 
13 112 or a school or program established under subpart 2.
142.  Standards for award of grants.  The commissioner shall establish eligibility 
15 standards for the award of grants from the fund under this section to local education 
16 providers and determine the allowable uses of grant money by eligible local education 
17 providers, including but not limited to hiring or contracting for tutors; providing stipends 
18 or other incentives to teachers, paraprofessionals, retired teachers and community 
19 organizations; developing curricula and related supplies; covering costs associated with 
20 renting or purchasing physical space for tutoring; and paying administrative expenses.
213.  Tutoring plan; eligibility.  To be eligible for a grant under this section, a local 
22 education provider must submit a tutoring plan to the department. To the extent practicable, 
23 the plan must include tutoring that is:
24 A.  Provided for groups of 4 or fewer students;
25 B.  Provided by the same tutor for the same group of students throughout the school 
26 year;
27 C.  Provided a minimum of 3 times per week;
28 D.  Provided during the school day in a manner that supplements, and does not 
29 supplant, regular academic instruction; 
30 E.  Provided by high-quality, trained tutors, including but not limited to teachers, 
31 paraprofessionals or community providers;
32 F.  Aligned with the local education provider's academic standards using high-quality 
33 curricula; 
34 G.  Data-driven, with interim assessments to monitor student progress; and
35 H.  Targeted to all students in a grade level or school.
36 If a tutoring plan does not include all of the components in this subsection, the plan must 
37 address the reason for the modification or omission and how the local education provider 
38 intends to achieve the same desired student outcomes. 
Page 2 - 130LR2309(01)14.  Priority.  The commissioner shall prioritize grant awards for tutoring plans 
2 submitted pursuant to subsection 3 serving students from low-income households or 
3 underserved students to address learning loss or unfinished learning due to extended gaps 
4 or interruptions in a student's education.
5ยง9102.  Reports; rulemaking
61.  Grant recipient report.  In each year in which a local education provider receives 
7 a grant pursuant to section 9101 for a tutoring plan submitted pursuant to section 9101, 
8 subsection 3, the local education provider shall submit a report to the department. The 
9 report must include:
10 A.  The number of students who are participating in the tutoring plan, including 
11 demographic information;
12 B.  Any adjustments made to the tutoring plan and the reason for those adjustments;
13 C.  How the local education provider maintained consistent access for participating 
14 students to instruction in the core curriculum and other instruction;
15 D.  How grants were used by the local education provider and a summary of other 
16 resources used;
17 E.  The criteria used to place students in the tutoring plan; 
18 F.  The student outcomes associated with the tutoring plan; and
19 G.  Whether the tutoring plan will continue in the following school year and, if not, the 
20 reason the tutoring plan will not continue.
212.  Biennial report.  Beginning January 15, 2023, and biennially thereafter, the 
22 department shall submit a report to the Governor and the joint standing committee of the 
23 Legislature having jurisdiction over education matters on the uses of the fund and the 
24 tutoring plans submitted pursuant to section 9101, subsection 3. The report must include:
25 A.  Detailed information on the grants awarded, the participating local education 
26 providers, the duration of the tutoring plans and a summary of the information provided 
27 by the local education providers pursuant to subsection 1;
28 B.  Highlights of high-performing local education providers, including those that have 
29 improved student learning through high-impact tutoring, and descriptions and analysis 
30 of practices that contributed to these improvements and any descriptions and 
31 explanations submitted by local education providers of strategies, services and tutoring 
32 plans that have been implemented and demonstrate effectiveness in addressing learning 
33 and achievement gaps; 
34 C.  Detailed plans for the expansion of existing tutoring plans and any applications or 
35 proposed applications for federal, local or foundation grant funding; 
36 D.  Any other actions that the department identifies that would result in efficient 
37 expansion of tutoring plans in this State with a target of expanding plans by at least 
38 20% each year;

40 F.  Any suggested legislation or budget recommendations necessary to improve the 
41 fund or tutoring plans.

2 chapter. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in 
3 Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
4Sec. 2.  Guidance.  The Commissioner of Education shall issue guidance and best 
5 practices for the delivery of so-called high-impact tutoring as provided in the Maine 
6 Revised Statutes, Title 20-A, chapter 320, including but not limited to mechanisms to 
7 expand high-impact tutoring using any federal funding available for this purpose and
