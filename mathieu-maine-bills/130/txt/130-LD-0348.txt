18SUMMARY
19 Currently there is no process for the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services to 
20 remove an attorney from the roster of attorneys qualified to provide legal services.  This 
21 bill authorizes the commission to remove an attorney from a roster when the commission 
22 determines, after notice and hearing, that the attorney violated the law or a standard adopted 
23 by the commission.
