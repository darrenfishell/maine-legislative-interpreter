11SUMMARY
12 This bill simplifies requirements for approval of educational programs for certified 
13 nursing assistants that are carried out by health care facilities by removing the requirement 
14 that health care facilities seeking approval must demonstrate that an educational institution 
15 cannot also provide such a program within 30 days of the application.  Programs carried 
16 out by health care facilities must still be approved by the Department of Health and Human 
17 Services consistent with the curriculum approved by State Board of Nursing and must still 
18 fulfill all standards established by the department and by the board.
