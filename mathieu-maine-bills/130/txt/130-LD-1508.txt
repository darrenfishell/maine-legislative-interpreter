5§6004-B.  Mediation
61.  Eviction mediation program established.  An eviction mediation program, 
7 referred to in this section as "the program" and administered by the Supreme Judicial Court, 
8 is established to provide mediation services in actions brought under this chapter. The 
9 program provides mediation services in an action brought under this chapter to support 
10 housing stability and prevent homelessness by achieving resolution of the action prior to 
11 entry of judgment against the tenant.  The Supreme Judicial Court may establish an 
12 orientation process for mediators and require a mediator to complete the orientation process 
13 prior to providing mediation services to the program.
142.  Mediation mandatory.  Participation in the program by the parties is mandatory if 
15 ordered by a court or requested by either party prior to or during the initial status conference 
16 under section 6004-C, subsection 2, paragraph B. The mediator shall schedule the 
17 mediation on or before the initial return date of the answer to the complaint.  If an 
18 immediate hearing is required to prevent irreparable damage to the dwelling or serious 
19 physical harm to a person, mediation is not required.
203.  Parties to mediation.  If mediation for an action is required under subsection 2, the 
21 following parties shall attend the mediation in any manner determined sufficient by the 
22 mediator:
23 A.  The landlord or a property manager who has authority to agree to a proposed 
24 settlement;
25 B.  The defendant;
26 C.  The attorney for each party who is represented by counsel; and
27 D.  Any other person the mediator determines necessary for effective mediation, 
28 including a housing counselor.
294.  Good faith effort.  Each party and the attorney for each party represented by counsel 
30 shall make a good faith effort to negotiate a settlement in the case.  If a party or attorney 
31 fails to attend mediation or make a good faith effort in the mediation, the court may impose 
32 an appropriate sanction on that party or attorney.
335.  Referral to legal assistance or housing counseling or rental assistance 
34programs.  At any time during the mediation process, the mediator may refer the defendant 
35 to legal assistance or housing counseling or assistance programs.
366.  Mediated agreement.  Mediation may address all issues needed to resolve the case, 
37 including the continuation of tenancy, modification of the terms of a tenancy or 
38 restructuring of past rent owed by the tenant.  An agreement reached by the parties through 
39 mediation must be in writing, signed by the parties and presented by the mediator in a report 
40 to the court for approval as a court order.
Page 2 - 130LR0873(01)17. Mediator's report.  Upon the conclusion of a mediation, the mediator shall submit 
2 a report to the court that includes:
3 A.  The agreement of the parties presented for approval as a court order under 
4 subsection 6;
5 B.  A detailed summary of all agreements among the parties, indicating each party's 
6 respective obligations agreed to; and
7 C.  Notification to the court if, in the mediator's opinion, a party did not negotiate in 
8 good faith.
98.  No waiver of rights.  Participation in the program does not result in the waiver of 
10 any right of a party afforded to a party who does not participate in the program.
119. Mediation services.  To provide mediation services under this section, a mediator 
12 must:
13 A.  Be trained in mediation and relevant aspects of the law related to real estate, forcible 
14 entry and detainer procedures or eviction prevention;
15 B.  Have knowledge of community-based resources that are available in the judicial 
16 district of the court in which the mediator is providing services;
17 C.  Have reasonable knowledge of rental assistance programs in the judicial district of 
18 the court in which the mediator is providing services; and
19 D.  Be capable of facilitating a resolution of the case that results or is likely to result in 
20 a mutually beneficial settlement to the parties.
2110.  Program evaluation.  The Supreme Judicial Court shall report annually to the 
22 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over housing matters and 
23 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters 
24 on:
25 A.  The performance of the program, including the number of mediations requested, 
26 the number of mediations that occur and the number of cases in which an agreement 
27 was reached; and
28 B.  Recommendations for any changes to the program.

16 This bill establishes an eviction mediation program to provide mediation services to

18 request mediation, which is then mandatory for the parties. The program also provides 
19 information on rental, housing and legal counseling and assistance to tenants.  This bill 
20 establishes court procedures for forcible entry actions and directs the Maine State Housing 
21 Authority to develop a form landlords must include with the summons and complaint 
22 detailing the tenant’s rights and providing information on rental, housing and legal 
23 assistance.  The bill also directs the Maine State Housing Authority to expend $1,350,000 
24 each fiscal year from the Housing Opportunities for Maine Fund to hire legal services for 
25 tenants subject to eviction proceedings and to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to offset 
26 costs to the court system for implementing the eviction mediation process.1
