3SUMMARY
4 Part A of this bill does the following.
5 1. It clarifies the jurisdiction of the Department of Professional and Financial 
6 Regulation, Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection to regulate transactions entered into by 
7 mail, telephone or electronic mail or using a creditor's website when the consumer is 
8 located in Maine.
9 2. It establishes that an automobile seller is regularly engaged in credit sales if the seller 
10 sells more than 15 cars per year on credit. Currently, a dealer can sell up to 25 cars a year 
11 on credit without complying with any disclosure, rate cap or repossession standards.
12 3. It defines a supervised lender to include a company that purchases and collects on 
13 supervised loans, regardless of whether the company maintains an office in this State. 
14 Current law already holds in-state companies to this standard.
15 4. It clarifies confidentiality provisions by referencing an exception currently found in 
16 another section of the Maine Consumer Credit Code.
17 5. It authorizes the Superintendent of Consumer Credit Protection to adjust fees to 
18 support the costs of compliance and staff attorney positions with revenues derived from 
19 nonbank mortgage companies. It also allows the superintendent to reduce fees by 
20 regulation.
21 6. It corrects references to the Superintendent of Consumer Credit Protection.
22 7. It specifically provides that the Superintendent of Consumer Credit Protection or the 
23 Superintendent of Financial Institutions has the authority, after notice to the licensee and 
24 opportunity to be heard, to suspend, revoke or deny renewal of a payroll processor's license.
25 8. It confirms the ability of the Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection to regulate 
26 transmission of digital currencies, such as Bitcoin.
27 9. It establishes the Superintendent of Consumer Credit Protection's authority over debt 
28 collectors consistent with authority granted the administrator with respect to other license 
29 types.
30 10. It adds to the laws governing debt collectors routine enforcement authority 
31 consistent with authority currently applied with respect to consumer lenders and creditors.
32 11. It adds to the laws governing debt collectors an assurance of discontinuance as an 
33 enforcement option consistent with current law applicable to consumer lenders and 
34 creditors.
35 Part B does the following.
36 1. It permits the use of a nationwide multistate licensing system to process licenses and 
37 registrations with respect to general creditors, debt collectors, money transmitters and other 
38 entities regulated by the Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection. It also authorizes the use 
39 of that system by large, national companies that already use the system for their licenses in 
40 other states.4
Page 24 - 130LR0146(01)1 2. It amends a notification date provision in the law to permit the Bureau of Consumer 
2 Credit Protection to use the nationwide mortgage licensing system for different business 
3 types.

5 the Legislature having jurisdiction over insurance and financial services matters relating to 
6 the business of "legal funding practices."

8 1.  It amends application and renewal fee provisions for entities licensed and regulated 
9 by the Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection to allow the bureau to use rulemaking to 
10 adjust fees.
11 2.  It allows the bureau to use the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry 
12 to license or register regulated entities.
13 3.  It authorizes the Superintendent of Consumer Credit Protection to permit affiliated 
14 companies to be under a single debt collector license.
15 Part E makes it a violation of the Maine Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to collect 
16 or attempt to collect a debt from medical expenses against an individual eligible for free or 
17 charity care. 
18 Part F adds requirements relating to collection actions for credit card debt and student 
19 loan debt.
20 Part G authorizes courts to refer cases to the Court Alternative Dispute Resolution 
21 Service for mediation and assess fees for such mediation.
