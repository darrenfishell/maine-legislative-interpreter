15Sec. 8.  24-A MRSA §4316, sub-§2, as corrected by RR 2019, c. 2, Pt. A, §28, is 
16 amended to read:
172.  Parity for telehealth services.  A carrier offering a health plan in this State may 
18 not deny coverage on the basis that the health care service is provided through telehealth if 
19 the health care service would be covered if it were provided through in-person consultation 
20 between an enrollee and a provider.  Coverage for health care services provided through 
21 telehealth must be determined in a manner consistent with coverage for health care services 
22 provided through in-person consultation.  A carrier shall reimburse a provider for the 
23 diagnosis, consultation with or treatment of an enrollee delivered through telehealth 
24 services on the same basis and at least at the rate of reimbursement at which the carrier 
25 reimburses a provider for the provision of the same, or substantially similar, service through 
26 in-person consultation.  If an enrollee is eligible for coverage and the delivery of the health 
27 care service through telehealth is medically appropriate, a carrier may not deny coverage 
28 for telehealth services.  A carrier may not offer a health plan under which any deductible 
29 applied to health care services delivered through telehealth accumulates separately from 
30 the deductible that applies in the aggregate to all services covered under the health plan. A 
31 carrier may offer a health plan containing a provision for a deductible, copayment or 
32 coinsurance requirement for a health care service provided through telehealth as long as 
33 the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or 
34 coinsurance applicable to a comparable service provided through in-person consultation.  
35 A carrier may not exclude a health care service from coverage solely because such health 
36 care service is provided only through a telehealth encounter, as long as telehealth is 
37 appropriate for the provision of such health care service.
38Sec. 9.  24-A MRSA §4316, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 289, §2, is repealed.
39Sec. 10.  Application.  The requirements of this Act apply to health plans, as defined 
40 in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 24-A, section 4301-A, subsection 7, executed, 
41 delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after January 1, 
42 2022.  For the purposes of this Act, all health plan contracts are deemed to be renewed no 
43 later than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.
Page 3 - 130LR0808(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill makes permanent the authorization for the delivery of health care services 
3 through telehealth by telephone that was provided through executive order during the 
4 declared public health emergency related to COVID-19.
5 Under current law, health insurance carriers are required to reimburse for services 
6 delivered through telehealth at parity with the reimbursement that would be provided if the 
7 services were delivered through an in-person consultation, but the use of audio-only 
8 telephone to deliver those services is not permitted. This bill removes that prohibition. The 
9 bill also clarifies that reimbursement for telehealth services must be made on the same basis 
10 and at the same rate as if the services were delivered in person and that a carrier may not 
11 establish separate deductible limits for telehealth services that are not applied in the 
12 aggregate with other services covered under a health plan.
13 Under current law, telehealth services reimbursed under the MaineCare program for 
14 the delivery of service using the telephone are limited to when interactive telehealth 
15 services are unavailable or when a telephonic service is medically appropriate for the 
16 underlying covered service. This bill removes that limitation and also clarifies that services 
17 provided through telehealth must be reimbursed at the same rate as comparable services 
18 provided through an in-person consultation.
19 The requirements in the bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after January 
20 1, 2022.2
