Page 1 - 130LR1884(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, coordinated specialty care programs exist in the State that could treat more 
4 individuals suffering from psychotic disorders but lack a funding mechanism; and
5Whereas, early treatment of symptoms of psychotic disorders helps prevent the onset 
6 of advanced mental illness and should begin as soon as possible; and
7Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
8 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
9 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
10 therefore,
11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
