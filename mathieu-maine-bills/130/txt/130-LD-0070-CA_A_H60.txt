Fiscal Note 
No significant cost to schools 
This legislation requires a principal or superintendent to approve a request from a parent or legal guardian of a 
student who has been affected by COVID-19 to not graduate the student or not promote the student to the next grar 
level if the student's school can accommodate adding the student to the affected grade level. Assuming that 
principals and superintendents will use cost as one of the criteria in determining a school's ability to accommodate 
such requests, there should be no significant costs to schools from this bill.
