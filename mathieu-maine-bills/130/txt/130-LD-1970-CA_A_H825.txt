SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, clarifies that a "local 
climate action plan," which may be adopted by a municipality or multimunicipal region, 
includes an evaluation of options for building resilience to natural hazards. It also clarifies 
that in addressing climate risks identified in. a municipality's or multimunicipal region's 
climate vulnerability assessment, as provided for in the bill, the municipality or 
multimunicipal region may include the potential effects of those risks on protected natural 
resources, as that term is defined under the Natural Resources Protection Act, and may 
develop a coordinated plan for addressing those risks and for building resilience to natural 
hazards. It also amends the laws governing the Maine Land Use Planning Commission's 
permit approval criteria for proposed developments to provide that, in making a 
determination regarding whether an applicant has made adequate provision for fitting the 
proposal harmoniously into the existing natural environment, the commission may consider 
the effect of at least 1.5 feet of sea level rise by 2050 and 4 feet of relative sea level rise by
