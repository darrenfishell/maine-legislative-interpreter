Page 1 - 130LR2378(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, it is essential to promote agricultural endeavors of all sizes, including 
4 subsistence farming and agricultural operations that have a large market share; and
5Whereas, less restrictive land use policies will encourage agricultural, commercial 
6 and residential development in this State; and
7Whereas, agricultural and residential development historically occur in tandem and 
8 should be addressed simultaneously; and
9Whereas, delaying this legislation beyond the 90-day period would detrimentally 
10 affect the development of agricultural homesteads; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

21 primary use.
222.  Conditions.  For residential construction in an area zoned for agricultural uses, a 
23 municipality may not require a condition that is more restrictive than any condition under

25Sec. 2.  30-A MRSA §4365 is enacted to read:
26§4365.  Minimum lot size requirements for agricultural zones

38 the minimum lot size of the most restrictive residential zone in that municipality.33
