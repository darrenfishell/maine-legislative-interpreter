9SUMMARY
10 The federal Family First Prevention Services Act requires fingerprint-based

12 residential treatment center, shelter, or other congregate care setting."  Current Maine law 
13 requiring these background checks references residential care facilities.  This bill amends 
14 the law to conform to the federal law, providing that the background check requirements 
15 apply to emergency children's shelters, shelters for homeless children and any group home 
16 that provides care for children.1
