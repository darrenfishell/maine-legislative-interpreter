Page 1 - 130LR2196(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current law enacted in 1999 that established an exemption for certain 
4 discharges of storm water to Class AA and SA waters has been disapproved by the United 
5 States Environmental Protection Agency; and
6Whereas, this disapproval creates regulatory uncertainty for the legality of certain 
7 existing discharges of storm water, and potential future discharges of storm water, to Class 
8 AA and SA waters; and
9Whereas, this uncertainty may have significant economic impacts on certain 
10 dischargers of storm water to Class AA and SA waters; and
11Whereas, in order to avoid these adverse consequences, modification of the 
12 exemption for certain discharges of storm water to Class AA and SA waters is appropriate 
13 and necessary; and
14Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
15 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
17 therefore,
18Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
19Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §464, sub-§4, ¶F, as amended by PL 1991, c. 66, Pt. B, §1, is

42 quality. For the purposes of this division, a discharge is temporary and short
