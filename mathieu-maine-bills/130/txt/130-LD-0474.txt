13 the peace and usefulness of the school, a school board shall expel any student, except a 
14 student who is enrolled in grade 5 or below:
15 A.  Who is deliberately disobedient or deliberately disorderly;
16 B.  For infractions of violence;
17 C.  Who possesses on school property a firearm as defined in Title 17‑A, section 2, 
18 subsection 12-A or a dangerous weapon as defined in Title 17‑A, section 2, subsection 
19 9 without permission of a school official;
20 D.  Who, with use of any other dangerous weapon as defined in Title 17‑A, section 2,
