Page 1 - 130LR1103(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Department of Administration and Financial Services, Office of 
4 Marijuana Policy is currently proposing rules that may go into effect before the expiration 
5 of the 90-day period; and
6Whereas, the proposed rules would significantly damage the well-being and health of 
7 tens of thousands of citizens of the State by restricting their access to medical marijuana; 
8 and
9Whereas, the proposed rules would do irreparable economic harm to thousands of 
10 citizens of the State through a dramatic increase in the cost of medical marijuana; and
11Whereas, the proposed rules would do irreparable economic harm to thousands of 
12 medical marijuana caregivers and to their thousands of employees; and
13Whereas, the proposed rules would do irreparable harm to the economy of the State 
14 by destroying businesses owned and domiciled in the State to the benefit of companies that 
15 are not based in the State and will not reinvest in this State; and
16Whereas, the proposed rules would impact the most vulnerable communities in this 
17 State the hardest, including rural municipalities with aging populations; and
18Whereas, the proposed rules make major changes that warrant legislative 
19 involvement and oversight; and
20Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
21 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
22 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
23 therefore,
24Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
