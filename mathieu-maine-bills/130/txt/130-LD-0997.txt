5CHAPTER 651
6SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT
7§5501.  Supplemental benefit for corrections officer
81.  Corrections officer; definition.  "Corrections officer," as used in this chapter, has 
9 the same meaning as in section 2801-A, subsection 2.
102.  Supplemental benefit.  A corrections officer who while in the performance of duty 
11 suffers bodily injury resulting from acts of a person in the custody of the jail, prison or state 
12 correctional facility where the corrections officer works and as a result of the injury is 
13 entitled to benefits under Title 39-A is entitled to a supplemental benefit in the amount of 
14 the difference between the weekly cash benefits to which the corrections officer is entitled 
15 under Title 39-A and the corrections officer's regular salary.
163.  Not chargeable against sick leave.  Any absence from work resulting from an 
17 injury described in subsection 2 may not be charged against available sick leave.
18Sec. 2.  39-A MRSA §201, sub-§3-A, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 294, §2, is 
19 amended to read:
20 B.  The employee is a law enforcement officer, corrections officer, E-9-1-1 dispatcher, 
21 firefighter or emergency medical services person and is diagnosed by an allopathic 
22 physician or an osteopathic physician licensed under Title 32, chapter 48 or chapter 36, 
23 respectively, with a specialization in psychiatry or a psychologist licensed under Title 
24 32, chapter 56 as having post-traumatic stress disorder that resulted from work stress, 
25 that the work stress was extraordinary and unusual compared with that experienced by 
26 the average employee and the work stress and not some other source of stress was the 
27 predominant cause of the post-traumatic stress disorder, in which case the post-
28 traumatic stress disorder is presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the 
29 worker's employment.  This presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing 
30 evidence to the contrary.  For purposes of this paragraph, "law enforcement officer," 
31 "corrections officer," "firefighter" and "emergency medical services person" have the 
32 same meaning as in section 328-A, subsection 1.  For the purposes of this paragraph, 
33 "E-9-1-1 dispatcher" means a person who receives calls made to the E-9-1-1 system 
34 and dispatches emergency services.  "E-9-1-1 dispatcher" includes an emergency 
35 medical dispatcher as defined in Title 32, section 85-A, subsection 1, paragraph D.
36 By January 1, 2022, the board shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of 
37 the Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters that includes an analysis of the 
38 number of claims brought under this paragraph, the portion of those claims that resulted 8

40 on costs to the State and its subdivisions.  The Department of Administrative and 
41 Financial Services, Bureau of Human Resources and the Department of Public Safety 
42 shall assist the board in developing the report, and the board shall seek the input of an 
43 association, the membership of which consists exclusively of counties, municipalities 
44 and other political or administrative subdivisions, in the development of the report.
7 This paragraph is repealed October 1, 2022.
8Sec. 3.  39-A MRSA §328-C is enacted to read:
9§328-C.  Impairment of health caused by infectious disease suffered by a corrections 
10officer
11 Impairment of health by infectious disease suffered by a corrections officer is governed 
12 by this section.
131.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
14 following terms have the following meanings.
15 A.  "Corrections officer" means an employee of the State or of a county whose place 
16 of employment is a correctional facility as defined in Title 34-A, section 1001, 
17 subsection 6 or a county or regional jail under Title 30-A, chapter 13 and who is 
18 responsible for the care, custody or direct supervision of a person confined in a jail, 
19 prison or state correctional facility pursuant to an order of a court or as a result of an 
20 arrest.
21 B.  "Infectious disease" means a disease resulting from the presence and activity of a 
22 pathogenic microbial agent, including, but not limited to, bacteria, viruses, fungi and 
23 parasites.
242.  Presumption.  If a corrections officer successfully passed a physical examination 
25 upon entry into service as a corrections officer, or subsequently successfully passed a 
26 physical examination, and the examination failed to reveal any evidence of a condition of 
27 impairment of health caused by an infectious disease, then a condition of impairment of 
28 health caused by an infectious disease resulting in total or partial disability or death of that 
29 corrections officer is presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary 
30 is shown by competent evidence.
31Sec. 4.  39-A MRSA §328-D is enacted to read:
32§328-D.  Heart disease or hypertension suffered by a corrections officer
33 Heart disease or hypertension suffered by a corrections officer is governed by this 
34 section.
351.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
36 following terms have the following meanings.

Page 3 - 130LR1659(01)1 B.  "Heart disease" means a structural or functional abnormality of the heart, or of the 
2 blood vessels supplying the heart, that impairs the heart's normal functioning.
3 C.  "Hypertension" means a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in 
4 the arteries is elevated.
52.  Presumption.  If a corrections officer who contracts heart disease or hypertension 
6 has met the requirements of subsections 3, 6 and 7, there is a rebuttable presumption that 
7 the corrections officer contracted the heart disease or hypertension in the course of 
8 employment as a corrections officer and as a result of that employment, that sufficient 
9 notice of the heart disease or hypertension has been given and that the heart disease or 
10 hypertension was not occasioned by any willful act of the corrections officer to cause the 
11 heart disease or hypertension.
123.  Medical tests.  In order to be entitled to the presumption in subsection 2, during the 
13 time of employment as a corrections officer, the corrections officer must have undergone 
14 a standard, medically acceptable test for evidence of the heart disease or hypertension for 
15 which the presumption is sought or evidence of the medical conditions derived from the 
16 heart disease or hypertension and that test did not indicate the presence or condition of heart 
17 disease or hypertension.
184.  Liability if services performed for more than one employer.  If a corrections 
19 officer who contracts heart disease or hypertension was employed as a corrections officer 
20 by more than one employer and qualifies for the presumption under subsection 2, and that 
21 presumption has not been rebutted, the employer and insurer at the time of the last 
22 substantial exposure to the risk of the heart disease or hypertension are liable under this 
23 Part.
245.  Retired corrections officer.  This section applies to a corrections officer who is 
25 diagnosed with heart disease or hypertension within 10 years of the corrections officer's 
26 last active employment as a corrections officer or prior to attaining 70 years of age, 
27 whichever occurs first.
286.  Length of service.  In order to qualify for the presumption under subsection 2, a 
29 corrections officer must have been employed as a corrections officer for at least 5 years.
307.  Written verification.  In order to qualify for the presumption under subsection 2, a 
31 corrections officer must sign a written affidavit declaring, to the best of the corrections 
32 officer's knowledge and belief, that the corrections officer's diagnosed heart disease or 
33 hypertension is not prevalent among the corrections officer's blood-related parents, 
34 grandparents or siblings and that the corrections officer has no substantial lifetime habits 
35 or personal activities that are associated with the corrections officer's diagnosed heart 
36 disease or hypertension.
37SUMMARY
38 This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing corrections officers and 
39 E-9-1-1 dispatchers.
40 1.  It provides a supplemental benefit paid to a corrections officer who is injured by the 
41 acts of a person in the custody of the jail, prison or state correctional facility where the 
42 corrections officer works if the injury qualifies the corrections officer for workers' 
43 compensation benefits.38
39
Page 4 - 130LR1659(01)1 2.  It adds corrections officers and E-9-1-1 dispatchers to the list of employees for 
2 whom there is a rebuttable presumption under the laws governing workers' compensation 
3 that when the employee is diagnosed by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist as having 
4 post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from work stress that was extraordinary and 
5 unusual, the post-traumatic stress disorder is presumed to have arisen out of and in the 
6 course of the worker's employment.
7 3.  It amends the workers' compensation laws by including a rebuttable presumption 
8 that a condition of impairment of health caused by an infectious disease resulting in total 
9 or partial disability or death of a corrections officer has been suffered in the line of duty, 
10 unless it is shown otherwise.
11 4.  It amends the workers' compensation laws by including a rebuttable presumption 
12 that heart disease or hypertension suffered by a corrections officer was caused in the course 
13 of employment as a corrections officer, like the provisions of current law that establish a 
14 rebuttable presumption that cancer contracted by a firefighter was caused by exposure to 
15 carcinogens in the course of the firefighter's firefighting duties.
