Page 6 - 130LR0406(01)1SUMMARY
2 Currently, Maine has no minimum age at which a child may be prosecuted for a crime.  
3 The purpose of this bill is to prevent children under 12 years of age from being prosecuted 
4 for crimes, to prevent children under 14 years of age from being incarcerated, to eliminate 
5 the current requirement that, if committed, a juvenile must be committed for at least a year 
6 and to prevent courts from imposing dispositions against juveniles that involve 
7 commitment without exhausting all other less restrictive alternatives.  The bill also 
8 mandates regular opportunities for judicial review of a juvenile's commitment in addition 
9 to providing an appellate avenue for relief from unfavorable reviews.
10 The overarching goal of the bill is to ensure that fewer children are in the juvenile 
11 justice system and that, if and when they do become involved in the system, there is a 
12 presumption against incarceration and a requirement for the regular review of any 
13 commitment imposed, in order to minimize the harm that incarceration can cause children.
14 The bill amends the statute governing a juvenile's right to counsel to specify that the 
15 right to counsel attaches at the juvenile's initial appearance and continues until the court no 
16 longer has jurisdiction over the juvenile, including all post-dispositional hearings and 
17 during the time of commitment.  The bill also requires counsel appointed by the court to 
18 continue to represent the juvenile throughout all proceedings concerning the juvenile, 
19 unless relieved by the court.  The Juvenile Court must assign counsel to a juvenile when a 
20 detention order is reviewed.
21 The bill amends the definition of "juvenile" as used in the Maine Juvenile Code to 
22 include a person 18 years of age or older who had been adjudicated as a juvenile during the 
23 period of a disposition that includes probation and commitment to the Department of 
24 Corrections beyond that person's 18th birthday.
25 The bill establishes that the Juvenile Court has jurisdiction over proceedings in which 
26 a juvenile had attained 12 years of age at the time of the offense, effective October 1, 2022.
27 The bill authorizes the Juvenile Court to appoint counsel for a juvenile upon the filing 
28 of a petition.  The bill requires the Juvenile Court to appoint counsel upon a disposition 
29 ordering a juvenile to the Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facility; counsel 
30 may be in addition to the juvenile's primary counsel.
31 The bill adds 2 considerations that must be accorded weight against ordering placement 
32 in a secure facility: whether the juvenile was under 14 years of age at the time of the crime 
33 and whether the adjudication is for a juvenile crime that would be a Class D or E crime if 
34 it were an adult crime and was not reduced from a crime that was charged as Class A, B or 
35 C.
36 The bill adds to the already existing review in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, 
37 section 3315 a requirement that the juvenile have counsel.  It allows courts to require the 
38 Department of Corrections, the Department of Health and Human Services, or both, to 
39 demonstrate the reasonableness of the current treatment or placement provided or offered 
40 if an appropriate treatment or an appropriate less restrictive alternative placement is not 
41 being provided.  It also allows such judicial reviews for individuals who are 18 to 20 years 
42 of age.
43 The bill allows a juvenile to request a hearing under Title 15, section 3317 and to 
44 petition for a reduction of a period of commitment and authorizes the court to reduce the 
Page 7 - 130LR0406(01)45 period of commitment or probation.  A juvenile may request this hearing only once every 
46 180 days absent extraordinary circumstances.
3 The bill allows a court to limit commitment to less than one year.
4 The bill allows for appeal of hearings pursuant to Title 15, section 3317.
5 The bill raises the age at which a juvenile may be committed to Long Creek Youth 
6 Development Center to 12 years of age beginning October 1, 2022.1
