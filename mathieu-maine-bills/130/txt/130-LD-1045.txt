21 the Maine Health Care Plan against unforeseen expenditures or revenue shortfalls not 
22 covered by the reserve account.  The board may borrow money to cover temporary 
23 shortfalls.
24§7507.  Revenue sources
251.  Maine Health Care Plan premium.  The Maine Health Care Board shall:
26 A.  Determine the aggregate cost of providing health care according to this chapter;
27 B.  Develop an equitable and affordable premium structure based on income, including 
28 unearned income, and a business health tax based on payroll;
29 C.  In consultation with the State Tax Assessor, develop an efficient means of collecting 
30 premiums and the business health tax developed under paragraph B;
31 D.  Coordinate with existing, ongoing funding sources from federal and state programs;
32 E.  Base the premium structure developed under paragraph B on ability to pay; and
33 F.  On or before January 15, 2022, submit to the Governor and the Legislature a report 
34 on the premium structure and business health tax developed under paragraph B to 
35 finance the Maine Health Care Plan.
362.  Federal receipts.  All federal funding received by the State, including the premium 
37 subsidies under the federal Affordable Care Act, is appropriated to the Maine Health Care 
38 Fund to be used to administer the Maine Health Care Plan under this chapter.  Federal 
39 funding that is received for implementing and administering the Maine Health Care Plan 
40 must be used to provide health care for residents of this State.
413.  Funds from outside sources.  Institutional providers operating under Maine Health 
42 Care Plan operating budgets may raise and expend funds from sources other than the Maine 25
Page 7 - 130LR0166(01)43 Health Care Plan including private donors.  Contributions to institutional providers in 
44 excess of $500,000 must be reported to the board.
34.  Governmental payments.  The Governor and, if required under federal law, the 
4 Commissioner of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner of Economic and 
5 Community Development shall seek all necessary waivers, exemptions, agreements and 
6 legislation so that all applicable federal payments to the State, including the premium tax 
7 credits under the federal Affordable Care Act, are paid directly to the Maine Health Care 
8 Fund.  When all required waivers, exemptions, agreements and legislation are obtained, the 
9 Maine Health Care Plan assumes responsibility for all health care benefits and health care 
10 services previously paid for with federal funds.  In obtaining the waivers, exemptions, 
11 agreements or legislation, the Governor and, if required, commissioners shall seek from the 
12 Federal Government a contribution for health care services in the State that reflects: 
13 medical inflation, the state gross domestic product, the size and age of the population of 
14 the State, the number of residents of the State living below the poverty level and the number 
15 of individuals in this State eligible for Medicare and services from the United States 
16 Department of Veterans Affairs and that does not decrease in relation to the federal 
17 contributions to other states as a result of the waivers, exemptions, agreements or savings 
18 from implementation of the Maine Health Care Plan.
195.  Federal preemption.  The board shall seek to secure a repeal or a waiver of any 
20 provision of federal law that preempts any provision of this chapter.  The Commissioner of 
21 Health and Human Services shall provide all necessary assistance.  In the application for 
22 an innovation waiver under Section 1332 of the federal Affordable Care Act, the board 
23 shall request to waive any provisions of the federal Social Security Act and any of the 
24 following provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act to the extent necessary to 
25 implement this Act:
26 A.  In 42 United States Code, Sections 18021 to 18024;
27 B.  In 42 United States Code, Sections 18031 to 18033;
28 C.  In 42 United States Code, Section 18071; and
29 D.  In 26 United States Code, Sections 36B and 5000A.
30 The request for a waiver of the federal Social Security Act must seek authorization for the 
31 Maine Health Care Plan to operate as a Medicare Advantage plan for eligible individuals.
32 In the event that a repeal or a waiver of law or regulations cannot be secured, the board 
33 shall adopt rules, or seek conforming state legislation or state plan amendments, consistent 
34 with federal law, in an effort to best fulfill the purposes of this chapter.
356.  Secondary to federal government programs.  The Maine Health Care Plan's 
36 responsibility for providing care is secondary to existing federal government programs for 
37 health care services to the extent that funding for these programs is not transferred to the 
38 Maine Health Care Fund or that the transfer is delayed beyond the date on which initial 
39 benefits are provided under the Maine Health Care Plan.
407.  No cost sharing.  Except as provided in section 7504, subsection 4, no deductible, 
41 copayment, coinsurance or other cost sharing may be imposed with respect to covered 
42 benefits.1
2
Page 8 - 130LR0166(01)1§7508.  Subrogation
21.  Collateral source.  When other payers for health care have been terminated, health 
3 care costs must be collected from collateral sources whenever medical services provided to 
4 an individual are, or may be, covered services under a policy of insurance, or other 
5 collateral source available to that individual, or when the individual has a right of action 
6 for compensation permitted under law.
7 A.  As used in this section, "collateral source" includes:
8 (1)  Health insurance policies and the medical components of automobile, 
9 homeowner's and other forms of insurance;
10 (2)  Medical components of workers' compensation;
11 (3)  Pension plans;
12 (4)  Employer plans;
13 (5)  Employee benefit contracts;
14 (6)  Government benefit programs;
15 (7)  A judgment for damages for personal injury;
16 (8)  The state of last domicile for individuals moving to the State for medical care 
17 who have extraordinary medical needs; and
18 (9)  Any 3rd party who is or may be liable to an individual for health care services 
19 or costs.
20 B.  As used in this section, "collateral source" does not include:
21 (1)  A contract or plan that is subject to federal preemption; or
22 (2)  Any governmental unit, agency or service to the extent that subrogation is 
23 prohibited by law.  An entity described in paragraph A is not excluded from the 
24 obligations imposed by this section by virtue of a contract or relationship with a 
25 governmental unit, agency or service.
26 C.  The board shall negotiate waivers, seek federal legislation or make other 
27 arrangements to incorporate collateral sources into the Maine Health Care Plan.
282.  Notification.  When an individual who receives health care services under the 
29 Maine Health Care Plan is entitled to coverage, reimbursement, indemnity or other 
30 compensation from a collateral source, the individual shall notify the health care provider 
31 and provide information identifying the collateral source, the nature and extent of coverage 
32 or entitlement and other relevant information.  The health care provider shall forward this 
33 information to the board.  The individual entitled to coverage, reimbursement, indemnity 
34 or other compensation from a collateral source shall provide additional information as 
35 requested by the board.
363.  Reimbursement.  The Maine Health Care Board shall seek reimbursement from 
37 the collateral source for services provided to the individual and may institute appropriate 
38 action, including legal proceedings, to recover the reimbursement.  Upon demand, the 
39 collateral source shall pay to the Maine Health Care Fund the sums it would have paid or 
40 expended on behalf of the individual for the health care services provided by the Maine 
41 Health Care Plan.2
3
4
5
6
Page 9 - 130LR0166(01)1 A.  In addition to any other right to recovery provided in this section, the board has the 
2 same right to recover the reasonable value of health care benefits from a collateral 
3 source as provided to the Commissioner of Health and Human Services.
4 B.  If a collateral source is exempt from subrogation or the obligation to reimburse the 
5 Maine Health Care Plan, the board may require that an individual who is entitled to 
6 medical services from the source first seek those services from that source before 
7 seeking those services from the Maine Health Care Plan.
8 C.  To the extent permitted by federal law, the board has the same right of subrogation 
9 over contractual retiree health care benefits provided by employers as other contracts, 
10 allowing the Maine Health Care Plan to recover the cost of health care services 
11 provided to individuals covered by the retiree benefits, unless arrangements are made 
12 to transfer the revenues of the health care benefits directly to the Maine Health Care 
13 Fund.
144.  Defaults, underpayments and late payments.  Default, underpayment or late 
15 payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by this chapter results in the remedies and 
16 penalties provided by law, except as provided in this section.  Eligibility for health care 
17 benefits under this chapter may not be impaired by any default, underpayment or late 
18 payment of any premium or other obligation imposed by this chapter.
19§7509.  Provider payments
201.  General provisions.  All health care providers licensed to practice in this State, and 
21 other providers as determined by the board, may participate in the Maine Health Care Plan.  
22 A participating health care provider shall comply with all federal laws and regulations 
23 governing referral fees and fee splitting, including, but not limited to, 42 United States 
24 Code, Sections 1320a-7b and 1395nn, whether reimbursed by federal funds or not.  A fee 
25 schedule or financial incentive may not adversely affect the care a patient receives or the 
26 care a health care provider recommends.
272.  Payments to noninstitutional providers.  The Maine Health Care Board shall 
28 establish and oversee a fair and efficient payment system for noninstitutional providers in 
29 accordance with this subsection.
30 A.  The board shall pay noninstitutional providers based on rates negotiated with 
31 providers.  Rates must take into account the need to address provider shortages.
32 B.  The board shall establish payment criteria and methods of payment for care 
33 coordination for patients, especially those with chronic illness and complex medical 
34 needs.
35 C.  Providers who accept any payment from the Maine Health Care Plan for a covered 
36 health care service may not bill the patient for the covered health care service.
37 D.  Providers must be paid within 30 business days for claims filed following 
38 procedures established by the board.
393.  Payments to institutional providers.  The board shall set annual budgets for 
40 institutional providers.  These budgets must consist of an operating and a capital budget.  
41 An institution's annual budget must be set to cover its anticipated health care services for 
42 the next year based on past performance and projected changes in prices and health care 
43 service levels.  The annual budget for each individual institutional provider must be set

24
25
26
Page 10 - 130LR0166(01)45 provider nor for a parent corporation that owns or operates one or more institutional 
46 providers.
34.  No balance billing.  Providers who accept any payment from the Maine Health 
4 Care Plan for a covered health care service may not bill the patient for the covered health 
5 care service.
65.  Capital investment plan.  The board shall periodically develop a capital investment 
7 plan that will serve as a guide in determining the annual budgets of institutional providers 
8 and in deciding whether to approve applications for approval of capital expenditures by 
9 noninstitutional providers.  Providers who propose to make capital purchases in excess of 
10 $500,000 must obtain board approval.  The board may alter the threshold expenditure level 
11 that triggers the requirement to submit information on capital expenditures.  Institutional 
12 providers shall propose these expenditures and submit the required information as part of 
13 the annual budget they submit to the board.  Noninstitutional providers shall submit 
14 applications for approval of these expenditures to the board.  The board shall respond to 
15 capital expenditure applications in a timely manner.
16§7510.  Maine Health Care Board
171.  Establishment.  The Maine Health Care Board is established to promote the 
18 delivery of high-quality, coordinated health care services that enhance health; prevent
