5 1801, subsection 4, who is not the person whose license is reinstated pursuant to this section 
6 or section 2412-A, subsection 7, who disconnects or disables the ignition interlock device

8 vehicle.
9Sec. 2.  Rulemaking for approved methods of disabling an ignition interlock

11 defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 29-A, section 1801, subsection 4, upon request, 
12 a code or procedure that allows a person authorized to perform service on a motor vehicle 
13 equipped with an ignition interlock device, as defined in Title 29-A, section 2401, 
14 subsection 5-A, at that repair facility to disable or disconnect the ignition interlock device 
15 without providing a breath sample, as long as that person's driver's license was not 
16 reinstated due to the installation of an ignition interlock device on the vehicle being 
17 serviced.  Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as described in 
18 Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
19SUMMARY
20 This bill provides an explicit exemption from the prohibition against tampering with 
21 an ignition interlock device, or "breathalyzer," when done for the express purpose of 
22 servicing a vehicle with such a device installed.  This bill also requires the Secretary of 
23 State to furnish a repair facility, upon request, with a code or procedure that allows a motor 
24 vehicle technician at that repair facility to disable or disconnect a breathalyzer without 
25 providing a breath sample by blowing into the device, as long as the vehicle being serviced 
26 is not the technician's.
