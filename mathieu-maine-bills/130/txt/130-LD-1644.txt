24 director. A member seeking disability retirement shall cooperate with the executive director 
25 in obtaining the member's medical records and may obtain an assessment from the health

27 or physical disability, and, if the health care provider finds that the member is disabled

44 any association with the retirement system other than providing independent medical 
45 examinations or medical consultations and receiving payment for these services and, 
Page 4 - 130LR0962(01)46 unless the member consents in writing, may not have previously examined or treated

15 and in accordance with subsection 4.  The executive director or the executive director's 
16 designee may obtain recommendations or opinions from the medical review service 
17 provider to assist in this determination.  A determination by the executive director or the 
18 executive director's designee that the member is not disabled may be appealed by the 
19 member to a hearing officer, who shall hear the appeal in accordance with section 17106-A.  
20 The board shall by rule provide for procedures for the member to participate in selection 
21 of the hearing officer who will hear the member's appeal. Rules adopted pursuant to this 
22 subsection are routine technical rules as defined in chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
234.  Medical evidence.  When reviewing medical evidence in making determinations of

25 medical opinions in the record and whether the opinions are supported by sound medical 
26 evidence and are consistent with other medical evidence in the record.

38 Upon agreement of the executive director and the person, rehabilitation services may

Page 10 - 130LR0962(01)44 rehabilitation services are likely to lead to substantially gainful activity.  When appropriate,

46 any medical indications that the recipient should not engage in a rehabilitation program or 
47 to identify a recipient too severely disabled to benefit from rehabilitation services in 
48 accordance with the purposes of this article.  Services must be provided by private and 
49 public rehabilitation counselors, government agencies and others approved by the 
50 executive director as qualified to provide rehabilitation services.  The executive director 
51 shall consider a rehabilitation counselor's rate of successfully placing rehabilitated 
52 employees in jobs relative to the placement rates of other counselors in the State as 
53 fundamental in deciding whether to approve the counselor as qualified.  This section does

15 B.  The executive director may require, once each year, that the person undergo 
16 examinations or tests, conducted in accordance with section 18526, to determine the 
17 person's disability.  The executive director may refer the records documenting the 
18 results of the examinations or tests and the person's file to the medical board for medical 
19 consultation regarding rehabilitation in accordance with section 17106, subsection 3, 
20 paragraph E.
21 (1)  After the disability has continued for 2 years, the disability must render the 
22 person unable to engage in any substantially gainful activity that is consistent with 
23 the person's training, education or experience and average final compensation 
24 adjusted by the same percentage adjustment as has been received under section 
25 18407.  The disability retirement benefit continues if the person can effectively 
26 demonstrate to the executive director that the person is actively seeking work.  For 
27 purposes of this subparagraph, the ability to engage in substantially gainful activity 
28 is demonstrated by the ability to perform work resulting in annual earnings that 
29 exceed $20,000 or 80% of the recipient's average final compensation at retirement, 
30 whichever is greater, adjusted by the same percentage adjustments granted under 
31 section 18407.
32 (2)  If the person refuses to submit to the examinations or tests under this paragraph, 
33 the disability retirement benefit is discontinued until that person withdraws the 
34 refusal.
35 (3)  If the person's refusal under subparagraph (2) continues for one year, all rights 
36 to any further benefits under this article cease.
37 (4)  If it is determined, on the basis of the examinations or tests under this 
38 paragraph, that the disability of a person no longer exists, the payment of the 
39 disability retirement benefit ceases.
40 (5)  The executive director shall notify the person in writing of the decision to 
41 discontinue the disability retirement allowance under subparagraph (2) or (4).
42 (a)  The decision is subject to appeal under section 17451.1

13 difference between the amount of the benefit payable under the other disability 
14 program and the amount of the benefit payable under this article.  The executive 
15 director shall require examinations or tests to determine whether the person is disabled 
16 as described in section 18521; and

18 12, is amended to read:
19 E.  If, during the first 5 years of reemployment, the person again becomes disabled and 
20 terminates employment, the retirement system shall resume paying the disability 
21 retirement benefit payable prior to the reemployment with all applicable cost-of-living 
22 adjustments, or if greater, a disability retirement benefit based upon the person's current 
23 average final compensation and shall provide rehabilitation services under in 
24 accordance with section 18527  if recommended by the medical  board.  The executive 
25 director shall require examinations or tests to determine whether the person is disabled 
26 as defined in section 18521; and
27Sec. 41.  5 MRSA §18553, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 1991, c. 469, §5, is 
28 further amended to read:
29 A.  A surviving spouse of the qualifying member is paid a $150 benefit each month 
30 beginning the first month after the death occurs and continuing during the surviving

27 Employees Retirement System and makes other changes relating to the structure of the

29 1.  Repeals the laws providing for a medical board and permits the executive director 
30 to contract with a medical review service provider;

32 Trustees of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System but independent contractors 
33 that serve as neutral and independent decision makers;

35 4.  Provides that an adverse decision by a hearing officer that is appealed to the court 
36 must be given de novo review;
37 5.  Restructures the disability retirement application process so that the executive 
38 director may grant benefits based on medical records and the member’s health care 
39 provider’s views, may obtain opinions and recommendations from the medical review 
40 service provider and may not deny an application for disability retirement benefits without 
41 first obtaining an independent medical examination unless waived by the member;1

5 7.  Provides that attorney's fees up to a maximum of $12,000 must be paid by the Maine 
6 Public Employees Retirement System for a member who appeals the denial of disability 
7 benefits and who subsequently is awarded those benefits;

9 Legislature having jurisdiction over retirement matters on the experience of the retirement 
10 system and its members under the changes made by the bill; and
