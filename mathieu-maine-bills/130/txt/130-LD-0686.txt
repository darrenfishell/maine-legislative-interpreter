21 requirement that the organization produce and post on its publicly accessible website a list 
22 of prescription drugs for which manufacturers have taken those actions.  It requires the 
23 organization to produce and post on its publicly accessible website a list of drug product 
24 families for which it intends to request pricing component data from manufacturers, 
25 wholesale drug distributors and pharmacy benefits managers and to notify the 
26 manufacturers, wholesale drug distributors and pharmacy benefits managers before 
27 requesting pricing component data.  It also amends related public reporting and
