11 This amendment replaces the bill. SUMMARY 
12 Current law in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 39-A, section 201, subsection 3-A, 
13 paragraph B creates for certain employees with post-traumatic stress disorder claims under 
14 the Workers' Compensation Act a rebuttable presumption that the condition is a work-
15 related injury. Current law also requires the Workers' Compensation Board to report to the 
16 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters by 
17 January 1, 2022 with an analysis of the claims brought under that law. Current law provides 
18 that these provisions are repealed on October 1, 2022. The amendment amends these 
19 provisions in the following ways. 
20 1. It repeals the reporting requirement and replaces it with a new prospective 
21 requirement for the Workers' Compensation Board to report to the joint standing committee 
22 of the Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters with an analysis of claims brought 
23 under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 39-A, section 201, subsection 3-A, paragraph B 5 
24 years and 10 years after the Legislature amends the provision to add a new category of 
25 employees eligible for the rebuttable presumption. 
26 2. It extends the repeal date by 3 years until October 1, 2025. This repeal date means 
27 that the rebuttable presumption for certain employees will no longer be available after 
28 October 1, 2025. To avoid a conflict, the reporting requirements will also be repealed on 
29 October 1, 2025. 
30 The amendment also establishes additional reporting requirements for the Workers' 
31 Compensation Board relating to claims brought under the rebuttable presumption provision 
32 in Title 39-A, section 201, subsection 3-A, paragraph B. It requires the board to report to 
33 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters in the 
34 following ways. 
3 5 1. It requires the board, no later than April 1, 2025, to report on rebuttable presumption 
36 claims made by corrections officers and E-9-1-1 dispatchers. 
37 2. It requires the board, no later than January 1, 2027, to report on rebuttable 
3 8 presumption claims made by law enforcement officers, firefighters or emergency medical 
39 services persons. This report will consist of claims data for claims brought by these 
40 employees under Title 39-A, section 201, subsection 3-A, paragraph B prior to its repeal 
41 date of October 1, 2025. 
42 3. It requires the board, no later than January 1, 2032, to report on rebuttable 
43 presumption claims by c01Tections officers and E-9-1-1 dispatchers. This report will

1 consist of claims data for claims brought by these employees under Title 3 9-A, section 201, 
2 subsection 3-A, paragraph B prior to its repeal date of October 1, 2025.

6 is received.
