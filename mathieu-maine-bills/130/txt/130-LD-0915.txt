Page 1 - 130LR1140(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง3196, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 274, ยง1, is repealed.
3SUMMARY
4 Public Law 2019, chapter 274 enacted the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 
5 3196, which requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide coverage 
6 to a MaineCare member for abortion services.  Abortion services that are not approved 
7 Medicaid services must be funded by the State.
8 The Hyde Amendment prohibits federal Medicaid funding for abortions except in cases 
9 of life endangerment, rape or incest.  This bill repeals Title 22, section 3196, removing the 
10 requirement that the department provide abortion services to MaineCare members and 
11 removing the requirement that the State pay when the abortion services are not covered by 
12 Medicaid.
