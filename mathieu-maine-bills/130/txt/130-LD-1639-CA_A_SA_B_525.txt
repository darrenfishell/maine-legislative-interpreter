This amendment adds an implementation date of February 1, 2023 for the changed definition of "waste generated 
within the State". Delaying the start date will restore $218,750 of the Other Special Revenue Funds revenue loss 
reflected in Committee "A" in fiscal year 2022-23 and the allocation for that amount is restored as well. As amended, 
the bill will still reduce Other Special Revenue Funds by $156,250 in fiscal year 2022-23 and continue to reduce by 
$375,000 in subsequent years.
