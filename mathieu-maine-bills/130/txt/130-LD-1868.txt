Page 1 - 130LR2261(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation restores funding to Maine's Tobacco Prevention and Control 
4 Program, which recently had its funding reduced; and
5Whereas, Maine has the highest adult smoking rate in the Northeast and, like the rest 
6 of the nation, is experiencing a youth tobacco use epidemic; and
7Whereas, smoking is the leading preventable risk factor for many of the leading 
8 causes of death of Maine people, including cancer, heart disease, lung disease and stroke, 
9 and increases an individual's risk for severe illness from COVID-19; and
10Whereas, tobacco use costs Maine $811 million in health care bills each year, 
11 including approximately $262 million in state Medicaid costs; each Maine household pays 
12 an additional $1,066 in state and federal taxes from smoking-caused government 
13 expenditures; and smoking costs Maine $647 million in productivity losses; and
14Whereas, adequate funding for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control 
15 programs leads to greater reductions in smoking, and the longer states adequately invest in 
16 such programs, the greater the impact; and
17Whereas, the reduction in funding has resulted in declines in funding for surveillance 
18 and evaluation, counter-marketing campaigns, eliminating tobacco-related health 
19 disparities and tobacco treatment; and
20Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
21 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
22 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
23 therefore,
24Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
25Sec. 1.  Appropriations and allocations.  The following appropriations and 
26 allocations are made.
