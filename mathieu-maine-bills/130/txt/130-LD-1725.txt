8 plan available to all eligible small employers within the plan's approved service area, and 
9 a health insurance carrier offering a small group health plan subject to this section shall

18 implement this section and the Federal Government approves a state innovation waiver 
19 amendment that extends reinsurance under section 3953 to the pooled market established 
20 pursuant to this section based on projections by the superintendent that both average 
21 individual premium rates and average small group premium rates would be the same or 
22 lower than they would have been absent the provisions of this section and chapter 54-A.  If 
23 this section is not implemented, the superintendent shall conduct an analysis of alternative 
24 proposals to improve the stability and affordability of the small group market.
25Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §2793, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 653, Pt. B, §2, is amended to

28 The superintendent shall develop clear choice designs for the individual and small

321.  Clear choice design.  For the purposes of this section, "clear choice design" means 
33 a set of annual copayments, coinsurance and deductibles for all or a designated subset of 
34 the essential health benefits. An individual health plan subject to section 2736-C or small 
35 group a pooled market health plan subject to section 2792 must conform to one of the clear 
36 choice designs developed pursuant to this section unless an opt-out request is granted it is

39 choice designs in consultation with working groups consisting of consumers, carriers, 
40 health policy experts and other interested persons. The superintendent shall adopt rules for 
41 clear choice designs, taking into consideration the ability of plans to conform to actuarial 
42 value ranges, consumer needs and promotion of benefits with high value and return on 
43 investment.  The superintendent shall develop at least one clear choice design for each tier

45 the federal Affordable Care Act. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine 
46 technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A. Clear choice designs 
47 apply to all individual and small group health plans offered in this State with effective dates 
48 of coverage on or after January 1, 2022 and to all small group health plans offered through 
49 the pooled market under section 2792.
73.  Annual review.  The superintendent shall consider annually whether to revise, 
8 discontinue or add any clear choice designs for use by carriers in the following calendar

13 sharing parameters consistent with a clear choice design developed pursuant to this section, 
14 a carrier may offer up to 3 health plans plan designs that modify one or more specific cost-
15 sharing parameters in a clear choice design if the carrier submits an actuarial certification 
16 to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the alternative plan design offers significant 
17 consumer benefits and does not result in adverse selection.  An alternative plan design may 
18 be offered only in a service area where the carrier offers at least one clear choice design 
19 plan at the same tier.
20Sec. 4.  24-A MRSA §3957, sub-§7, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 90, Pt. B, §8, is

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT        Page 3 - 130LR2078(01)        DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT46 in determining the member insurer's reimbursement.  With the approval of the 
47 superintendent, the association may annually adjust the initial level of claims and the 
48 maximum limit to be retained by the insurer to reflect changes in costs, utilization, 
49 available funding and any other factors affecting the sustainable operation of the 
50 association.
6 A-1.  In any plan year in which a pooled market is operating in accordance with section 
7 2792, the association shall operate a retrospective reinsurance program providing 
8 coverage to member insurers for all individual and small group health plans issued in 
9 this State in that plan year.  For plan years beginning in 2022, if the pooled market has 
10 not been implemented pursuant to section 2792, subsection 5, the association may 
11 operate a retrospective reinsurance program for individual health plans, subject to the 
12 approval of the superintendent.
13 (1)  The association shall reimburse member insurers based on the total eligible 
14 claims paid during a calendar year for a single individual in excess of the 
15 attachment point specified by the board. The board may establish multiple layers 
16 of coverage with different attachment points and different percentages of claims 
17 payments to be reimbursed by the association.
18 (2)  Eligible claims by all individuals enrolled in individual or small group health 
19 plans in this State may not be disqualified for reimbursement on the basis of health 
20 conditions, predesignation by the member insurer or any other differentiating 
21 factor.
22 (3)  The board shall annually review the attachment points and coinsurance 
23 percentages and make any adjustments that are necessary to ensure that the 
24 retrospective reinsurance program operates on an actuarially sound basis.
25 (4)  The board shall ensure that any surplus in the retrospective reinsurance 
26 program at the conclusion of a plan year is used to lower attachment points, 
27 increase coinsurance rates or both for that plan year, consistent with its 
28 responsibility to ensure that the program operates on an actuarially sound basis.
29 B.  A member insurer shall apply all managed care, utilization review, case 
30 management, preferred provider arrangements, claims processing and other methods 
31 of operation without regard to whether claims paid for coverage are reinsured under 
32 this subsection.  A member insurer shall report for each plan year the name of each 
33 high-priced item or service for which its payment exceeded the amount allowed for 
34 eligible claims and the name of the provider that received this payment.  The 
35 association shall annually compile and publish a list of all reported names.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill changes the effective date of individual and small group health plans that must 
38 be offered in the State through a pooled market from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023.
