Page 1 - 130LR2313(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and 
4 Atmospheric Administration recently adopted federal regulations implementing portions 
5 of the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan; and
6Whereas, the immediate impact of these regulations is the closure to lobster fishing 
7 of approximately 1,000 square miles of federal waters off the coast of Maine from October 
8 to January, starting in October 2021; and
9Whereas, the long-term impact of these regulations challenges the viability of Maine's 
10 fixed gear fishing industry; and
11Whereas, the recent stay of these regulations by a United States District Court is likely 
12 a temporary reprieve from the negative impacts of these regulations on Maine's fixed gear 
13 fishing industry; and
14Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
15 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
17 therefore,
