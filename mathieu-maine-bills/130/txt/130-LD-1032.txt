3§1164.  Special Administrative Expense Fund
4 The Special Administrative Expense Fund is created as a special fund in the State 
5 Treasury.  All interest, fines and penalties collected under this chapter and all voluntary 
6 contributions tendered as a contribution to this fund must be paid into this fund.  The money 
7 may not be expended or available for expenditure in any manner that would permit its 
8 substitution for, or a corresponding reduction in, federal funds that would in the absence of 
9 that money be available to finance expenditures for the administration of the Employment 
10 Security Law  Reemployment Assistance Program.  Nothing in this section prevents the 
11 money from being used as a revolving fund to cover expenditures, necessary and proper 
12 under the law, for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, 
13 subject to the charging of those expenditures against those funds when received.  The 
14 money in this fund must be used by the commissioner either for the payment of costs of 
15 administration that are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against 
16 federal grants or other funds received for or in the Employment Security Administration 
17 Fund on or after January 1, 1943, to finance the Maine Wage Assurance Fund established 
18 in section 632; for the payment of costs of administering chapter 26, for which federal 
19 funds are not available; or to fund activities that will improve the solvency of the 
20 Unemployment Compensation Fund.  The money must be available either to satisfy the 
21 obligations incurred by the bureau directly or by requesting the Treasurer of State to 
22 transfer the required amount from the Special Administrative Expense Fund to the 
23 Employment Security Administration Fund or the Maine Wage Assurance Fund.  The 
24 Treasurer of State shall upon receipt of a written request of the commissioner make any 
25 such transfer.  The commissioner shall give notice to the commission prior to any 
26 expenditures from this fund.  The commissioner shall order the transfer of the funds or the 
27 payment of any such obligation and the funds must be paid by the Treasurer of State on 
28 requisitions drawn by the commissioner directing the State Controller to issue the State 
29 Controller's warrant for them.  The warrant must be drawn by the State Controller based 
30 upon bills of particulars and vouchers certified by an officer or employee designated by the 
31 commissioner.  The money in this fund is specifically made available to replace, within a 
32 reasonable time, any money received by this State pursuant to section Section 302 of the 
33 Federal federal Social Security Act as amended that, because of any action or contingency, 
34 has been lost or has been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, 
35 those necessary for the proper administration of the Employment Security Law  
36 Reemployment Assistance Program.  The money in this fund must be continuously 
37 available to the commissioner for expenditure in accordance with this section and may not 
38 lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund except as provided.  Any money in the 
39 Special Administrative Expense Fund may be used to make refunds of interest, penalties 
40 or fines erroneously collected and deposited in the Special Administrative Expense Fund.  
41 On June 30th of each year all money in excess of $100,000 in this fund must be transferred 
42 to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.

48 amount or 33 1/3%, rounded to the nearest dollar, of the individual's total wages paid for 
49 insured work during the individual's base period, plus the supplemental weekly benefit for 
50 dependents payable under subsection 6 unless otherwise specified in subsection 4-A.
5 A.  If a dislocated worker, as defined in section 1196, subsection 1, who is in training 
6 approved under section 1192, subsection 6, 6-A, 6-C, 6-D or 6-E qualifies for 
7 additional benefits under section 1043, subsection 5, paragraph B, or exhausts the 
8 worker's entitlement to benefits available to the worker under this subsection, the 
9 maximum amount under this subsection is the product of the worker's most recent 
10 weekly benefit amount multiplied by the number of weeks in which the worker 
11 thereafter attends an approved training program.  No increase may be made under this 
12 paragraph, with respect to any benefit period, greater than 26  20 times the individual's 
13 weekly benefit amount.
14 (1)  Benefits paid to an individual under this paragraph may not be charged against 
15 the experience rating record of any employer, but must be charged to the General 
16 Fund.
17 (2)  No benefits may be paid under this paragraph to any person:
18 (b)  Until the person has exhausted benefits for which the person is eligible

24 19, Section 2291, et seq., and any amendments or additions thereto, or a similar 
25 successor provision of that Act, except that any individual who was eligible 
26 for and received less than 26  20 weeks of benefits under the United States 
27 Trade Act may receive benefits for the number of weeks by which their 
28 benefits under that Act are less than 26  20 weeks.
29Sec. 8.  26 MRSA §1191, sub-§4-A is enacted to read:

33 A.  Twelve times the individual's weekly benefit amount, if the state average 
34 unemployment rate is at or below 5 1/2%;

Page 4 - 130LR1539(01)44 for the employer an experience rating record, to which are credited all the contributions 
45 that the employer pays on the employer's own behalf. This chapter may not be 
46 construed to grant any employer or individuals in the employer's service prior claims 
47 or rights to the amounts paid by the employer into the fund. Benefits paid to an eligible 
48 individual under the Employment Security Law Reemployment Assistance Program 
49 must be charged against the experience rating record of the claimant's most recent 
50 subject employer or to the General Fund if the otherwise chargeable experience rating 
51 record is that of an employer whose status as such has been terminated; except that no 
52 charge may be made to an individual employer but must be made to the General Fund 
53 if the commission finds that:
11 (1)  The claimant's separation from the claimant's last employer was for misconduct 
12 in connection with the claimant's employment or was voluntary without good cause 
13 attributable to the employer;
14 (2)  The claimant has refused to accept reemployment in suitable work when 
15 offered by a previous employer, without good cause attributable to the employer;
16 (3)  Benefits paid are not chargeable against any employer's experience rating

18 (5)  Reimbursements are made to a state, the Virgin Islands or Canada for benefits 
19 paid to a claimant under a reciprocal benefits arrangement as authorized in section

21 state, the Virgin Islands or Canada under such an arrangement are less than the 
22 amount of wages for insured work required for benefit purposes by section 1192, 
23 subsection 5;
24 (6)  The claimant was hired by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
25 open by a Legislator given a leave of absence under chapter 7, subchapter 5‑A, and 
26 the claimant's separation from this employer was because the employer restored 
27 the Legislator to the position after the Legislator's leave of absence as required by 
28 chapter 7, subchapter 5‑A;
29 (7)  The claimant was hired by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left

33 separation from military service;
34 (8)  The claimant was hired by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
35 open by an individual given a leave of absence for family medical leave provided 
36 under Maine or federal law, and the claimant's separation from this employer was 
37 because the employer restored the individual to the position at the completion of 
38 the leave; or
39 (9)  The claimant initiated a partial separation or reduction of hours and that partial 
40 separation or reduction of hours was agreed to by the employee and employer.
