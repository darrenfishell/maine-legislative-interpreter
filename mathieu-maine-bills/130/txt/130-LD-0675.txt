36 B. The fine in any calendar year is equal to 80% of the difference between the revenue

14ยง2037. Prohibition on withdrawal of identified prescription drugs for sale
151. Withdrawal from sale prohibited.  It is a violation of this chapter for any

25 determines has withdrawn an identified prescription drug from sale or distribution in this 
26 State in violation of this section.
27Sec. 2.  Legislative findings; impact of price increases for prescription 
28drugs.  In order to protect the safety, health and economic well-being of the residents of 
29 this State by guarding them from the negative and harmful impact of unsupported price 
30 increases for prescription drugs, the enactment of this Act is necessary and the Legislature 
31 finds that:
32 1. Access to prescription drugs is necessary for the residents of this State to maintain 
33 or acquire good health;
34 2. Unsupported price increases negatively impact the ability of residents of this State 
35 to obtain prescription drugs and thereby endanger the health and safety of residents of this 
36 State to maintain or acquire good health;
37 3. Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs threaten the economic well-being 
38 of residents of this State and endanger their ability to pay for other necessary and essential 
39 goods and services including housing, food and utilities;
40 4.  Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs contribute significantly to a 
41 dramatic and unsustainable rise in health care costs and health insurance that threatens the 
42 overall ability of residents of this State to obtain health coverage and maintain or acquire 
43 good health;
Page 4 - 130LR1633(01)1 5. Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs contribute significantly to rising 
2 state costs for health care provided and paid for through state-funded medical assistance 
3 programs for residents of this State who are older, living with disabilities or have low 
4 incomes and health insurance programs for public employees, including employees of the 
5 State, municipalities and counties, school districts and institutions of higher education, and 
6 retirees whose health care costs are funded by public programs, thereby threatening the 
7 ability of the State to fund those programs adequately and further threatening the ability of 
8 the State to fund other programs necessary for the public good and safety, such as public 
9 education and public safety; and
10 6.  Analysis of the increase in prices charged by manufacturers of prescription drugs 
11 demonstrates that many price increases for high-cost and high-volume prescription drugs 
12 are not supported by adequate evidence of improved clinical benefit or by significant 
13 increase in costs to the manufacturer related to the production or sale of the product.
14SUMMARY
15 This bill makes prescription drug manufacturers subject to fines for the sale of 
16 prescription drugs in this State identified as having an unsupported price increase. The 
17 determination of what constitutes an unsupported price increase for a prescription drug is 
18 based on whether there was no, or inadequate, new clinical evidence to support the price 
19 increase, as demonstrated by the analyses of prescription drugs prepared annually by the 
20 Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, or successor organization.15
