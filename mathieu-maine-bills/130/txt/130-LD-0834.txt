2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA ยง2008, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, ยง2, is amended 
3 to read:
4ยง2008.  Deceased victims
5 An offender's obligation to pay restitution is not affected by the death of the victim to 
6 whom the restitution is due.  The money collected as restitution must be forwarded to the 
7 estate of the victim.  If an offender is an heir, beneficiary or recipient of the victim's estate, 
8 any restitution paid to the estate under this section may not benefit the offender but must 
9 be distributed to any other heir, beneficiary or recipient as if the distribution of the estate's 
10 assets did not include the offender or, if the victim's estate has no heir, beneficiary or 
11 recipient other than the offender, the restitution must be paid to the Victims' Compensation 
12 Fund under Title 5, chapter 316-A or the Victims' Property Compensation Fund under Title 
13 5, chapter 316-C, determined by whether the restitution is for underlying injury or property 
14 damage.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill prohibits a deceased victim's restitution from being paid to an offender if the 
17 offender is an heir, beneficiary or recipient of funds from the victim's estate.  If an offender 
18 is an heir, beneficiary or recipient of a victim's estate, the restitution must be distributed to 
19 any other heir, beneficiary or recipient of the estate as if the distribution of the estate did 
20 not include the offender.  If a victim's estate has only the offender as an heir, beneficiary 
21 or recipient, the restitution must be paid to the Victims' Compensation Fund or the Victims' 
22 Property Compensation Fund, determined by whether the restitution is for underlying 
23 injury or property damage.16
