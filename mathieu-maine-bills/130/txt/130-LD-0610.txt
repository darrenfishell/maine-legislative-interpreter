Page 1 - 130LR0965(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA ยง635, as enacted by PL 1989, c. 804, is amended to read:
3ยง635.  Overcompensation by employer
41.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A.  "Net amount" means the amount of money due an employee as compensation after 
7 any deductions or withholdings other than an employer's withholding for the purpose 
8 of recovering any overcompensation.
9 A-1.  "Employer" means a person in this State that employs individuals and includes 
10 the State and political subdivisions of the State.  "Employer" includes a person acting 
11 in the interest of an employer directly or indirectly.
12 B.  "Overcompensation" means any compensation paid to an employee that is greater 
13 than that to which the employee is entitled under the compensation system established 
14 by the employer, but does not include fringe benefits, paid leave, awards, bonuses, 
15 settlements or insurance proceeds in respect to or in lieu of compensation, expense 
16 reimbursements, commissions or draws or advances against compensation.
17 C.  "Paid leave" has the same meaning as in section 636, subsection 1, paragraph C.
182.  Recovery of overcompensation; limitations.  An employer who has 
19 overcompensated an employee through employer error may not withhold more than 10% 
20 5% of the net amount of any subsequent pay without the employee's written permission, 
21 except that, if the employee voluntarily terminates employment, the employer may deduct 
22 the full amount of overcompensation from any wages due.  An employer who has 
23 overcompensated an employee through employer error may not recover more than the 
24 amount of overcompensation paid to that employee in the 3 years preceding the date of 
25 discovery of the overcompensation.
263.  Violation.  If an employer with over 25 employees violates this section, that 
27 employer forfeits any claim to the overcompensation.
28 If an employer with 25 or fewer employees knows of the limitation limitations established 
29 by subsection 2 and violates this section, that employer forfeits any claim to the 
30 overcompensation.  Employers An employer of 25 or fewer employees who do does not 
31 know of the limitation limitations established by subsection 2 and who violate violates this 
32 section shall return all money withheld in excess of that permitted under subsection 2 within 
33 3 days of written or oral demand by the employee, or forfeit forfeits any claim to the 
34 overcompensation.
354.  Application.  This section is applied as follows.
36 A.  An employer has the burden of proof, except that, if the overcompensation amounts 
37 to less than 15% of the correct net amount of the employee's compensation, the 
38 employer must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the employee knowingly 
39 accepted the overcompensation.
40 B.  If an employee knowingly accepts the overcompensation, this section does not 
41 apply.
Page 2 - 130LR0965(01)1 C.  This section, except for the forfeiture provisions in subsection 3, does not limit or 
2 affect an employer's general civil remedies against an employee or an employee's 
3 general civil remedies against an employer.
4SUMMARY
5 This bill amends the definition of "overcompensation" by an employer to exclude 
6 compensation in the form of paid leave.  It provides a definition of "employer."  It changes 
7 the maximum amount an employer may withhold from an employee's pay to recover 
8 overcompensation from 10% to 5%.  It prohibits an employer from recovering more than 
9 the amount of overcompensation paid to an employee in the 3 years preceding the discovery 
10 of the overcompensation.  The bill also specifies that the section of law regarding 
11 overcompensation by employers that includes these provisions does not limit or affect an 
12 employee's general civil remedies against an employer.
