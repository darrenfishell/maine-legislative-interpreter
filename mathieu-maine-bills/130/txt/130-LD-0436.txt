Page 1 - 130LR0143(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §341-I is enacted to read:
3§341-I.  Fees, interest and lien authority
41.  Applicability.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Title to the contrary, this 
5 section applies to all fees established pursuant to this Title.
62.  Interest.  In addition to other remedies specifically authorized in this Title, the 
7 department shall charge interest at a rate of 15% per annum on any fee or portion of a fee 
8 not paid by its due date, unless the commissioner finds the amount too small or the 
9 likelihood of recovery too uncertain.
103.  Lien established.  A fee or any portion of a fee not paid within 90 days of its due 
11 date and accruing interest is a lien against real estate of a license holder.
12 A.  A certificate of lien signed by the commissioner must be sent by certified mail to 
13 the license holder or agent of record prior to being recorded and may be filed in the 
14 office of the clerk of the municipality in which the real estate is located. The lien is 
15 effective when the certificate is recorded with the registry of deeds for the county in 
16 which the real estate is located. The certificate of lien must include a description of the 
17 real estate, the amount of the lien and the name of the owner as grantor.
18 B.  When the amount for which a lien has been recorded under this subsection has been 
19 paid or reduced, the commissioner, upon request by any person of record holding 
20 interest in the real estate that is the subject of the lien, shall issue a certificate 
21 discharging or partially discharging the lien. The certificate must be recorded in the 
22 registry in which the lien was recorded pursuant to paragraph A. Any action of 
23 foreclosure of the lien must be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the State 
24 in the Superior Court for the judicial district in which the real estate subject to the lien 
25 is located.
26Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §344, sub-§2-C is enacted to read:
272-C.  After-the-fact application.  For an application submitted to the department after 
28 an activity requiring a permit pursuant to this Title has begun, the department may either 
29 accept or refuse to accept, in whole or in part, the application for processing. When 
30 considering whether to accept an application submitted after the date and time it is required 
31 to be submitted pursuant to this Title, the department may consider relevant factors 
32 including, but not limited to, the following:
33 A.  The amount of time that has passed since the application was required to be 
34 submitted;
35 B.  The impact on the environment caused by the activity that is the subject of the 
36 application;
37 C.  Other violations of rules, statutes or licenses related to the activity that is the subject 
38 of the application;
39 D.  The applicant's prior noncompliance with rules, statutes or licenses and deadlines 
40 for submission of applications under this Title;
Page 2 - 130LR0143(01)1 E.  The potential negative effect on voluntary compliance programs and other licensing 
2 programs within the department caused by accepting the application; and
3 F.  The deterrent effect a refusal to accept the application would have on both the 
4 applicant and others that perform activities requiring approval by the department 
5 without first submitting a timely application.
6Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §347-A, sub-§1, ¶B, as repealed and replaced by PL 1993, c. 
7 204, §1, is amended to read:
8 B.  Before initiating a civil enforcement action pursuant to paragraph A, the 
9 commissioner shall issue a notice of violation to the person or persons the 
10 commissioner considers likely to be responsible for the alleged violation or violations.  
11 The notice of violation must describe the alleged violation or violations, to the extent 
12 then known by the commissioner; cite the applicable law, rule and term or condition of 
13 the license, permit or order alleged to have been violated; and provide time periods for 
14 the alleged violator to take necessary corrective action and to respond to the notice.  A 
15 notice of violation does not represent a final agency decision and is not appealable.  For 
16 violations the commissioner finds to be minor, the notice may state that further 
17 enforcement action will not be pursued if compliance is achieved within the time period 
18 specified in the notice or under other appropriate circumstances.  The commissioner is 
19 not required to issue a notice of violation before issuing an emergency order pursuant 
20 to subsection 3 or other applicable provision of this Title; nor is the commissioner 
21 required to issue a notice of violation before referring an alleged violation to the 
22 Attorney General for criminal prosecution or in a matter requiring immediate 
23 enforcement action.
24Sec. 4.  38 MRSA §347-A, sub-§2, as amended by PL 1999, c. 127, Pt. A, §54, is 
25 further amended to read:
262.  Hearings.  The commissioner shall give at least 30 days' written notice to the alleged 
27 violator of the date, time and place of any hearing held pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph 
28 A, subparagraph (3).  The notice must specify the act or omission which that is claimed to 
29 be in violation of law or regulation.
30 Any hearing conducted under the authority of this subsection must be in accordance with 
31 the provisions of Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter IV  4.  At the hearing, the alleged violator 
32 may appear in person or by attorney and answer the allegations of violation and file a 
33 statement of the facts, including the methods, practices and procedures, if any, adopted or 
34 used by that person to comply with this chapter and present such evidence as may be 
35 pertinent and relevant to the alleged violation.
36 After a hearing, or in the event of a failure of the alleged violator to appear on the date set 
37 for a hearing, the commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, make findings of fact based 
38 on the record and, if the commissioner finds that a violation exists, shall issue an order 
39 aimed at ending the violation and that may include required corrective action and a civil 
40 penalty calculated pursuant to section 349, subsection 2.  The person to whom an order is 
41 directed shall immediately comply with the terms of that order.

4 person provides substantial credible evidence that the violation was committed by another 
5 person other than that person or a contractor, employee or agent of the owner, lessee, 
6 manager, easement holder or occupant.  This subsection does not prevent the department, 
7 the board or a court from requiring an owner, lessee, manager, easement holder or occupant 
8 of premises to remediate or abate environmental hazards or damage or to reimburse the 
9 department for the cost of such remediation or abatement.  An Once notified in writing of 
10 a violation, an owner, lessee, manager, easement holder or occupant of premises is subject 
11 to criminal sanctions or civil penalties or forfeitures for failure to remediate or abate a 
12 violation of this Title or an environmental hazard or damage; to reimburse the department 
13 for the cost of such remediation or abatement; or to comply with a lawful administrative 
14 order or court order to remediate or abate environmental hazards or damage  for such 
15 remediation or abatement.
16 A.  The department shall investigate substantiated allegations by an owner, lessee, 
17 manager, easement holder or occupant that the violation was caused by another person.
18 B.  If an owner, lessee, manager, easement holder or occupant is subjected to criminal 
19 sanctions or civil penalties or forfeitures, or if such a person is required to remediate 
20 or abate environmental hazards or damage as a result of violations by another person, 
21 the owner, lessee, manager, easement holder or occupant has a cause of action against 
22 the actual violator to recover all damages and costs, including attorney's fees, incurred 
23 in connection with the environmental damage, and all costs, including attorney's fees, 
24 incurred in bringing the action to recover.
25 C.  This subsection does not apply to persons who are defined as "responsible parties" 
26 under chapter 3, subchapters II-A 2-A and  II-B  2-B; chapter 13, subchapter  II‑A  2-A; 
27 or chapter 13‑B.
