44 exceed 30 days, with or without an underlying suspended disposition of commitment 
Page 2 - 130LR0247(01)45 to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facility, which confinement must 
46 be served concurrently with any other period of confinement previously imposed and 
47 not fully discharged or imposed on the same date but may be served intermittently as 
48 the court may order and must be ordered served in a facility approved or operated by 
49 the Department of Corrections exclusively for juveniles.  The court may order such a 
50 disposition to be served as a part of and with a period of probation that is subject to 
51 such provisions of Title 17‑A, section 1807 as the court may order and that must be 
52 administered pursuant to Title 34‑A, chapter 5, subchapter 4.  Revocation of probation 
53 is governed by the procedure contained in subsection 2.  Any disposition under this 
54 paragraph is subject to Title 17‑A, section 2305 except that a statement is not required 
55 to be furnished and the day-for-day deduction must be determined by the facility, but

62 juvenile is committed for a period of confinement, the court shall determine whether 
63 reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the 
64 juvenile from the juvenile's home or that reasonable efforts are not necessary because 
65 of the existence of an aggravating factor as defined in Title 22, section 4002, subsection 
66 1-B and whether continuation in the juvenile's home would be contrary to the welfare
