3 to read:
410.  License nontransferable absent approval.  An off-track betting facility license

8Sec. 2.  8 MRSA §275-D, sub-§14 is enacted to read:
914.  All off-track betting facilities subject to same laws.  A person licensed to operate 
10 an off-track betting facility under Public Law 2019, chapter 626, section 16 is deemed for 
11 all purposes to have been licensed under this section as of the date the commission awarded 
12 the license under Public Law 2019, chapter 626, section 16 and has the same rights and 
13 privileges and is subject to the statutes and rules applicable to the holder of a license issued 
14 under this section as of that date.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill authorizes the transfer or assignment of an off-track betting facility license if 
17 the transfer or assignment is approved by the State Harness Racing Commission after 
18 applying to the transferee or assignee the tests generally applicable to the fitness of original 
19 licensees.
20 The bill also clarifies that persons licensed to operate off-track betting facilities under 
21 Public Law 2019, chapter 626, section 16, which allowed commercial tracks that closed in 
22 order to further the interests of the harness racing industry to be licensed as off-track betting 
23 facilities, are subject to the same laws and have the same rights and responsibilities as off-
24 track betting facilities licensed under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 8, section 275-D.16
