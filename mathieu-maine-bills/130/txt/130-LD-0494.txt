Page 1 - 130LR0433(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §931, first ¶, as amended by PL 2007, c. 175, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
4 The State Board of Arbitration and Conciliation, in this subchapter called the "board," 
5 consists of 3 members appointed by the Governor from time to time upon the expiration of 
6 the terms of the several members, for terms of 3 years.  One member must be an employer 
7 of labor or selected from some an association representing employers of labor, and another 
8 must be an employee or selected from some a bona fide trade or labor union.  The 3rd 
9 member must represent the public interests of the State and serves as chair. Vacancies 
10 occurring during a term must be filled for the unexpired term.  Members When meeting to 
11 deliberate or vote with respect to a matter before the board, members of the board are 
12 entitled to receive $150 a day per meeting for their services for the time actually employed 
13 in the discharge of their official duties.  For all other purposes, members of the board are 
14 entitled to receive $300 a day for their services for the time actually employed in the 
15 discharge of their official duties.  They are entitled to receive their traveling and all other 
16 necessary expenses. The costs for services rendered and expenses incurred by the State 
17 Board of Arbitration and Conciliation and any state allocation program charges must be 
18 shared equally by the parties to the proceedings and must be paid into a special fund 
19 administered by the Maine Labor Relations Board.  Authorization for services rendered 
20 and expenditures incurred by the State Board of Arbitration and Conciliation is the 
21 responsibility of the Executive Director of the Maine Labor Relations Board.  All costs 
22 must be paid from that special fund.  The executive director may estimate costs upon receipt 
23 of a request for services and collect those costs prior to providing the services.  The 
24 executive director shall bill or reimburse the parties, as appropriate, for any difference 
25 between the estimated costs that were collected and the actual costs of providing the 
26 services.  Once one party has paid its share of the estimated cost of providing the service, 
27 the matter is scheduled for hearing.  A party who has not paid an invoice for the estimated 
28 or actual cost of providing services within 60 days of the date the invoice was issued is, in 
29 the absence of good cause shown, liable for the amount of the invoice together with a 
30 penalty in the amount of 25% of the amount of the invoice.  Any penalty amount collected 
31 pursuant to this provision section remains in the special fund administered by the Maine 
32 Labor Relations Board and that fund does not lapse.  The executive director is authorized 
33 to collect any sums due and payable pursuant to this provision section through civil action.  
34 In such an action, the court shall allow litigation costs, including court costs and reasonable 
35 attorney's fees, to be deposited in the General Fund if the executive director is the prevailing 
36 party in the action.  The executive director shall, annually, on or before July 1st, make a 
37 report of the activities of the State Board of Arbitration and Conciliation to the Governor.  
38 The board shall from time to time adopt rules of procedure as it determines necessary, 
39 including rules of procedure for proceedings under chapter 18.  Rules adopted pursuant to 
40 this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
41Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §968, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2019, c. 184, §1, is further 
42 amended to read:
431.  Maine Labor Relations Board.  The Maine Labor Relations Board, established by 
44 Title 5, section 12004‑B, subsection 2, consists of 3 members and 6 alternates appointed 
45 by the Governor, subject to review by the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
Page 2 - 130LR0433(01)46 having jurisdiction over labor matters and to confirmation by the Legislature.  The 
47 Governor, in making appointments, shall name one member and 2 alternates to represent 
48 employees, one member and 2 alternates to represent employers and one member and 2 
49 alternates to represent the public.  The member and alternates representing employees may 
50 not have worked in a management capacity or represented employer interests in any 
51 proceedings at any time during the prior 6 years.  The member and alternates representing 
52 the public may not have worked in a management capacity or represented employer 
53 interests in any proceedings or have worked for a labor organization or served in a 
54 leadership role in a labor organization at any time during the prior 6 years.  The member 
55 representing the public serves as the board's chair and the alternate representing the public 
56 serves as an alternate chair.  Members of the board are entitled to compensation according 
57 to the provisions of Title 5, chapter 379.  The alternates are entitled to compensation at the 
58 same per diem rate as the member that the alternate replaces.  The term of each member 
59 and each alternate is 4 years, except that of the members and alternates first appointed, one 
60 member and 2 alternates are appointed for a term of 4 years, one member and 2 alternates 
61 are appointed for a term of 3 years and one member and 2 alternates are appointed for a 
62 term of 2 years.  The members of the board, its alternates and its employees are entitled to 
63 receive necessary expenses.  Per diem and necessary expenses for members and alternates 
64 of the board may be paid from the board's General Fund appropriation if, in the discretion 
65 of the executive director, doing so would not create a financial hardship for the board; 
66 otherwise, per diem and necessary expenses for members and alternates of the board, as 
67 well as state cost allocation program charges, must be shared equally by the parties to any 
68 proceeding at which the board presides and must be paid into a special fund administered 
69 by the board from which all costs must be paid.  The executive director may estimate costs 
70 upon receipt of a request for services and collect those costs prior to providing the services.  
71 The executive director shall bill or reimburse the parties, as appropriate, for any difference 
72 between the estimated costs that were collected and the actual costs of providing the 
73 services.  Once one party has paid its share of the estimated cost of providing the service, 
74 the matter is scheduled for hearing.  A party who has not paid an invoice for the estimated 
75 or actual cost of providing services within 60 days of the date the invoice was issued is, in 
76 the absence of good cause shown, liable for the amount of the invoice together with a 
77 penalty in the amount of 25% of the amount of the invoice.  Any penalty amount collected 
78 pursuant to this provision subsection remains in the special fund administered by the Maine 
79 Labor Relations Board, and that fund does not lapse.  The executive director is authorized 
80 to collect any sums due and payable pursuant to this provision subsection through civil 
81 action.  In such an action, the court shall allow litigation costs, including court costs and 
82 reasonable attorney's fees, to be deposited in the General Fund if the executive director is 
83 the prevailing party in the action.  At its discretion, the board may allocate all costs to a 
84 party that presents a frivolous complaint or defense or that commits a blatant violation of 
85 the applicable collective bargaining law.  When the board meets on administrative or other 
86 matters that do not concern the interests of particular parties or when any board member 
87 presides at a prehearing conference, the members' per diem and necessary expenses must 
88 be paid from the board's regular appropriation for these purposes.  The executive director 
89 and legal or professional personnel employed by the board are members of the unclassified 
90 service.

Page 3 - 130LR0433(01)2 This bill adjusts the compensation structure for members of the State Board of 
3 Arbitration and Conciliation and the Maine Labor Relations Board.  For the State Board of 
4 Arbitration and Conciliation, the bill changes the per diem compensation for members of 
5 the board to provide that, when meeting to deliberate or vote with respect to a matter before 
6 the board, members receive $150 a day per meeting for their services for the time actually 
7 employed in the discharge of their official duties and, for all other purposes, members 
8 receive $300 a day for their services for the time actually employed in the discharge of their 
9 official duties.  For the Maine Labor Relations Board, the bill provides the board's 
10 executive director the discretion to provide the members' per diem compensation and 
11 related costs from the board's General Fund appropriation, rather than requiring the parties 
12 to a case to share the costs.
