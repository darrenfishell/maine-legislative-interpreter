Page 1 - 130LR2362(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, Public Law 2021, chapter 290, An Act Regarding Remote Participation in 
4 Public Proceedings, does not apply to public bodies such as the Finance Authority of Maine 
5 to which specific statutory provisions for remote participation already apply; and
6Whereas, the Finance Authority of Maine prefers to have the new law apply to its 
7 proceedings instead of the older, more limited statute governing emergency board meetings 
8 in certain cases; and
9Whereas, there is a need to have in place a law that governs remote participation in 
10 public proceedings of the Finance Authority of Maine after the termination of the state of 
11 emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 37-B, 
12 section 742 in response to the public health emergency caused by the spread of the novel 
13 coronavirus disease referred to as COVID-19; and
14Whereas, members of the Finance Authority of Maine inhabit various parts of the 
15 State and may need or wish, based on public health or other considerations such as severe 
16 weather, to conduct business remotely as soon as possible; and
17Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
18 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
19 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
20 therefore,
21Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
22Sec. 1.  10 MRSA ยง971, as amended by PL 1995, c. 117, Pt. C, ยง1, is further

28 membership of the authority may does not impair the right of the quorum to exercise all 
29 powers and perform all duties of the members.

31 executive officer to be an emergency requiring action of the members on not more than 3
