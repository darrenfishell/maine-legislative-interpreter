SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the resolve. The amendment requires the Department of 
Health and Human Services to review its statutory and regulatory authority over home care 
agencies that provide direct care services in the home to assist individuals with the activities 
of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, rather than reviewing the rules 
governing in-home personal care assistance services. The depaiiment is directed to include 
providers, consumers, direct care workers, the long-term care ombudsman and other 
interested parties in the review process. The department is directed to submit a report, no 
later than January 15, 2022, to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human 
Services with recommendations. The committee is authorized to repo1i out legislation. The 
amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
