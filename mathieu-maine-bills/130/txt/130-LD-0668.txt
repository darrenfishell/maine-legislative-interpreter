2PART A
3Sec. A-1.  1 MRSA §403-B is enacted to read:
4§403-B.  Remote participation in public proceedings
5 It is the intent of the Legislature that actions of public bodies subject to this subchapter 
6 be taken openly and their deliberations be conducted openly.  This section governs 
7 participation in a public proceeding of such a public body by a member of that public body 
8 when the member is not physically present.  Remote participation may not be used to defeat 
9 the purposes of this subchapter as stated in section 401.  The Legislature may not allow its 
10 members to participate remotely in public proceedings of the Legislature.
111.  Definition.  As used in section, "remote participation" means participation through 
12 telephonic, video, electronic or other similar means of communication.
132.  Remote participation; requirements.  Except as provided in subsection 6, a public 
14 body subject to this subchapter may not allow a member of the public body to participate 
15 remotely in any of its public proceedings unless the remote participation is in accordance 
16 with this subchapter and:
17 A.  After notice and public hearing, the public body has adopted a written policy or 
18 rule that authorizes a member of the public body who is not physically present to 
19 participate in a public proceeding of that public body in a manner that allows all 
20 members to simultaneously hear and speak to each other during the public proceeding 
21 and allows members of the public attending the public proceeding at the location 
22 identified in the notice required by section 406 to hear all members of the public body.  
23 The policy may not allow remote participation in executive sessions.  The policy must 
24 prohibit a member who is participating in the public proceeding remotely from voting 
25 on an issue that was discussed in an executive session if the executive session 
26 immediately precedes the proceeding in which the vote is taken;
27 B.  For a public body consisting of 3 or fewer members, at least one member is 
28 physically present at the location identified in the notice required by section 406; and, 
29 for a public body consisting of more than 3 members, a quorum is physically present 
30 at the location identified in the notice required by section 406, unless immediate action 
31 is imperative and physical presence of a quorum is not reasonably practicable within 
32 the period of time in which action must be taken.  The determination that a quorum is 
33 not required under this paragraph must be made by the presiding officer of the public 
34 body and the facts supporting that determination must be included in the minutes of the 
35 meeting.  A public body consisting of 3 or more members may not consider matters 
36 other than those requiring immediate action in a public proceeding held pursuant to this 
37 subsection when a quorum is not physically present.  Each member must be physically 
38 present for at least one proceeding each year;
39 C.  Each member of the public body who is participating in the public proceeding 
40 remotely identifies for the record all persons present at the location from which the 
41 member is participating.  The member shall note for the record when any person enters 
42 or leaves the location throughout the course of the public proceeding;
43 D.  All votes taken during the public proceeding are taken by roll call; and
Page 2 - 130LR1348(01)1 E.  Each member of the public body who is participating in the public proceeding 
2 remotely receives any documents or other materials presented or discussed at the public 
3 proceeding in advance or when made available at the public proceeding if the 
4 transmission technology is available.
5 A member of the public body who is not physically present at the location identified in the 
6 notice required by section 406 may not participate and may not vote in an adjudicatory 
7 proceeding.
8 Failure to comply with this subsection does not invalidate an action of the body.
93.  State public bodies.  The policy under subsection 2 applicable to a state public 
10 body must be adopted by the public body as a major substantive rule under the Maine 
11 Administrative Procedure Act.
124.  County and municipal public bodies.  A county or municipality may by ordinance 
13 require stricter requirements than those set out in this section and may prohibit remote 
14 participation by any public body under its jurisdiction.
155.  Elected public bodies.  A public body consisting of elected members may adopt 
16 the policy under subsection 2 only after the constituents of the public body have voted to 
17 authorize the public body to adopt the remote participation policy.  The public body shall 
18 provide notice and hold a separate hearing before adopting the remote participation policy.
196.  Exceptions.  The following public bodies are exempt from the provisions of this 
20 section, and a member of the following bodies may participate in a public proceeding of 
21 the public body when the member is not physically present:
22 A.  The Finance Authority of Maine, as provided in Title 10, section 971-A;
23 B.  The Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, as provided in

42 majority of those members present and voting is necessary for any action taken by the

44 quorum to exercise all powers and perform all duties of the members.
32.  Emergency meeting.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, in a 
4 situation determined by the chief executive officer to be an emergency requiring action of

32Sec. B-4.  22 MRSA §2054, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2015, c. 449, §2, is further 
33 amended to read:
344.  Powers of authority.  The powers of the authority are vested in its members, and 5 
35 members of the authority constitute a quorum at any meeting of the authority.  A vacancy 
36 in the membership of the authority does not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the 
37 rights and perform all the duties of the authority.  An action taken by the authority under 
38 this chapter may be authorized by resolution approved by a majority of the members present 
39 at any regular or special meeting, which resolution takes effect immediately, or an action 
40 taken by the authority may be authorized by a resolution circularized or sent to each 
41 member of the authority, which resolution takes effect at such time as a majority of the 
42 members have signed an assent to such resolution.  Resolutions of the authority need not 1
2
Page 4 - 130LR1348(01)43 be published or posted.  The authority may delegate by resolution to one or more of its 
44 members or its executive director such powers and duties as it considers proper.

14 and who is participating through telephonic, video, electronic or other similar means 
15 of communication identifies all persons present at the location from which the member 
16 is participating;
17 C.  A member who participates while not physically present at the location of the public

20 attendance is not reasonably practical must be stated in the minutes of the meeting; and
21 D.  Each member who is not physically present at the location of the public proceeding

5SUMMARY
6 This bill clarifies when members of public bodies may participate remotely in public 
7 proceedings of those bodies.  It prohibits a body subject to the Freedom of Access Act from 
8 allowing its members to participate in its public proceedings through telephonic, video, 
9 electronic or other similar means of communication unless the body has adopted through 
10 major substantive rulemaking a written policy that authorizes remote participation in a 
11 manner that allows all members to simultaneously hear and speak to each other during the 
12 public proceeding and allows members of the public attending the public proceeding at the 
13 location identified in the meeting notice to hear all members of the body.  It outlines 
14 requirements for setting up remote participation, quorums, participation in executive 
15 sessions and voting.  The bill also requires that each member of a public body subject to 
16 the Freedom of Access Act be physically present in at least one public proceeding each 
17 year and prohibits the Legislature from allowing its members to participate in its public 
18 proceedings remotely.
19 The bill authorizes municipalities and counties to impose stricter requirements than are 
20 provided in the bill and allows municipalities and counties to prohibit the use of remote 
21 participation by any public body under their jurisdictions.  It provides that an elected public 
22 body may adopt a remote participation policy only after the constituency of the elected 
23 public body has voted to authorize the body to adopt the policy.
24 The bill provides, in Parts A and B, that the exemptions for the Finance Authority of 
25 Maine, the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, the Maine Health 
26 and Higher Educational Facilities Authority, the Maine State Housing Authority, the Maine 
27 Municipal Bond Bank, the Emergency Medical Services' Board and the Workers' 
28 Compensation Board, whose statutes currently provide for remote participation, expire on 
29 July 1, 2027.  Those entities will need to adopt policies that comply with the law to continue 
30 any remote participation.
31 The bill amends, in Part C, the Freedom of Access Act to require the joint standing 
32 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters to conduct a review 
33 of any proposed statutory authorization of remote participation or change in accessibility 
34 with respect to public proceedings.6
