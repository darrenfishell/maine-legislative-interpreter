Amend the amendment by striking out all of section 6 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 6. 35-A MRSA §1513 is enacted to read: 
§1513. Divestiture of underperforming transmission and distribution utility 
The commission shall initiate an adjudicatory proceeding, on its own motion or at the 
request of the Public Advocate, in accordance with this section to determine whether 
divestiture of an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility is warranted if the 
utility consistently fails to meet the service standards established in section 301, subsection 
1-A, consistently fails to meet the requirements of section 301, subsection 1 or is unable to 
fulfill its statutory duties as a public utility because it is financially impaired. If, at the 
conclusion of the adjudicatory proceeding, the commission determines that divestiture of a 
transmission and distribution utility is warranted, the commission shall order divestiture of 
or by the utility in accordance with this section: 
1. Determination by the commission. The commission shall order the owner of the 
transmission and distribution utility to divest the utility if the acquisition of the utility from 
a qualified buyer: 
A. Will result, over the long term, in net benefits to ratepayers in the form of lower 
rates or better service than the rates and service provided by the transmission and 
distribution utility; 
B. Is for a fair and reasonable purchase price negotiated by a qualified buyer and the 
transmission and distribution utility or as determined by the Superior Court in 
accordance with subsection 2; 
C. Demonstrates that the qualified buyer has sufficient financial and technical 
capability, expertise and experience to own and operate the utility and the ability to 
comply with all of the legal requirements, including but not limited to achievement of 
policies pursuant to Title 38, section 576-A and section 577, subsection 1, of a 
transmission and distribution utility; and 
D. Will benefit ratepayers as determined in accordance with section 708, subsection 
2, paragraph C, subparagraph (2). 
2. Superior Court review. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, a 
transmission and distribution utility may apply by petition to the Superior Court of 
Kennebec County to determine a fair and reasonable price that provides just compensation 
for the sale of the transmission and distribution utility or its assets if the qualified buyer 
and transmission and distribution utility are unable to negotiate a price. The court shall 
hold a hearing on the petition in which the parties are permitted to present factual and expert 
testimony and other evidence concerning the value of the utility or its assets and shall 
render a decision. The decision of the Superior Court may be appealed to the Supreme 
Judicial Court sitting as the Law Court in the same manner as an appeal taken from a 
judgment of the Superior Court in a civil action. 
3. More than one buyer. If more than one qualified buyer proposes to acquire the 
transmission and distribution utility or its assets, the commission shall order divestiture to 
the qualified buyer that will provide the greatest net benefits to ratepayers.'

Amend the amendment by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment retains the substance of Committee Amendment "A" while making 
several changes. 
1. Like the committee amendment, this amendment requires the Public Utilities 
Commission to adopt rules governing the evaluation of transmission and distribution utility 
performance, but it limits the requirement to utilities with more than 50,000 customers. It 
permits the establishment of standards for utilities serving fewer than 50,000 customers. 
This amendment requires the commission to evaluate annually the data provided by a utility 
in its quarterly reports regarding service standards. 
2. This amendment requires the Public Utilities Commission to identify priorities using 
stakeholder input regarding the issues involved in the transition to a clean, affordable and 
reliable electric grid and to order certain utilities to submit a filing to the commission on 
addressing those priorities, as well as on grid relationships, customer energy consumption 
and usage, planning scenarios, forecasts of projected load, baseline energy supply data and 
assessments, analysis of hosting capacity, analysis of available and emerging technologies 
necessary to enable load management and flexibility, an assessment of the environmental, 
equity and environmental justice impacts of grid plans and cost-effective near-term grid 
investments and operations needed to achieve the priorities.

This amendment reduces the number of Public Utilities Commission positions added by the bill from 5 Staff Attorney 
positions and 6 Utility Analyst positions to 1 Staff Attorney position and 2 Utility Analyst positions. It also reduces 
the one-time allocation for contracted services from $650,000 to $400,000 for a study, but moves it into fiscal year 
2022-23 from fiscal year 2023-24. The net incremental change is to increase allocations by $206,237 in fiscal year 
2022-23, but the allocations in subsequent years will be considerably less. As amended, in fiscal year 2022-23 the bill 
will include ongoing allocations of $499,028 for positions and related costs and the one-time allocation of $400,000 
for contracted services.
