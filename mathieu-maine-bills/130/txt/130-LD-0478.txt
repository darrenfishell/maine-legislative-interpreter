14§22101.  Compensation payments
15 The State Controller shall make compensation payments in the amounts directed by 
16 this chapter to persons entitled to compensation from the Unjustly Incarcerated Persons 
17 Compensation Fund established in section 1524.
18§22102.  Persons entitled to compensation
191.  Requirements.  A person is entitled to compensation if:
20 A.  The person has served in whole or in part a sentence of imprisonment under the 
21 laws of this State; and
22 B.  The person has established by a preponderance of the evidence that:
23 (1)  The person was convicted of murder or a Class A, B or C crime and 
24 subsequently imprisoned;
25 (2)  The conviction was reversed or vacated and either the charges were dismissed 
26 or on retrial the person was found not guilty;
27 (3)  The person did not commit the crime for which the person was convicted and 
28 was not an accessory or accomplice to the acts that were the basis of the conviction 
29 and resulted in a reversal or vacation of the judgment of conviction, dismissal of 
30 the charges or finding of not guilty on retrial; and
31 (4)  The person did not commit or suborn perjury, fabricate evidence or by the 
32 person's own conduct bring about the conviction.  Neither a confession or 
33 admission later found to be false nor a guilty plea constitutes committing or 
34 suborning perjury, fabricating evidence or bringing about the conviction under this 
35 subsection.
362.  Concurrent sentence.  A person is not entitled to compensation under subsection 
37 1 for any part of a sentence of imprisonment during which the person was also serving a 
38 concurrent sentence for another crime to which subsection 1 does not apply.
Page 2 - 130LR0850(01)13.  Deceased person.  If a deceased person would be entitled to compensation under

6 potentially entitled to compensation under section 22102, subsection 1 information, both

9 B.  A list of and contact information for nonprofit advocacy groups, identified by the 
10 Department of Corrections, that assist persons in filing claims for compensation under 
11 this chapter.
122.  Timing.  The Department of Corrections shall provide the information required 
13 under subsection 1:
14 A.  At the time of the release of the person from imprisonment; or
15 B.  As soon as practicable after the Department of Corrections has reason to believe 
16 that the person is entitled to compensation under section 22102, subsection 1.

20 Civil Procedure.  The claim must be brought by the person within a period of 2 years after 
21 the dismissal of the criminal charges against the person or a finding of not guilty on retrial.  
22 If the person had the criminal charges dismissed or obtained a finding of not guilty on

36 Court sitting as the Law Court.

381.  Compensation; time served.  A person who meets the requirements of section 
39 22102 is entitled to compensation in an amount equal to $50,000 multiplied by the number 
40 of years served in imprisonment, expressed as a fraction to reflect partial years.
Page 3 - 130LR0850(01)12.  Compensation; registration as sex offender.  A person who, after serving a 
2 sentence of imprisonment in this State for which the person is entitled to compensation 
3 under subsection 1, was required to register as a sex offender is entitled to additional 
4 compensation in an amount equal to $10,000 multiplied by the number of years served as 
5 a registered sex offender, expressed as a fraction to reflect partial years.
63.  Offset.  This subsection applies to compensation under this chapter if the claimant 
7 previously received a qualifying monetary award or subsequently receives a qualifying 
8 monetary award.

10 State or any political subdivision of the State in a civil action related to the same subject 
11 or has entered into a settlement agreement with the State or any political subdivision 
12 of the State related to the same subject, the amount of the award in the action or the 
13 amount received in the settlement agreement, less any sums paid to attorneys or for 
14 costs in litigating the other civil action or obtaining the settlement agreement, must be

19 wins a monetary award against the State or any political subdivision of the State in a 
20 civil action related to the same subject, or enters into a settlement agreement with the 
21 State or any political subdivision of the State related to the same subject, the claimant 
22 shall reimburse the State for the sum of money paid under the judgment, less any sums 
23 paid to attorneys for costs in litigating the other civil action or obtaining the settlement 
24 agreement.  A reimbursement required under this paragraph may not exceed the amount 
25 of the monetary award the claimant wins for damages in the other civil action or the 
26 amount received in the settlement agreement.
27§22107.  Payment of compensation
281.  Choice of compensation.  A person entitled to compensation under section 22102,

36 other actuarial factors within the discretion of the State Controller. Annuity payments under 
37 this subsection may not be accelerated, deferred, increased or decreased. A person entitled 
38 to annuity payments under this subsection may not sell, mortgage or otherwise encumber 
39 or anticipate the payments, wholly or partly, by assignment or otherwise.

8SUMMARY
9 This bill repeals the existing compensation for wrongful imprisonment law that relies 
10 on a pardon based on innocence and establishes a new compensation fund and process and 
11 changes the standard for eligibility.  Under this bill, the claimant must establish by a 
12 preponderance of the evidence that:
13 1.  The person was convicted of murder or a Class A, B or C crime and subsequently 
14 imprisoned;
15 2.  The conviction was reversed or vacated and either the charges were dismissed or on 
16 retrial the person was found not guilty;
17 3.  The person did not commit the crime or crimes for which the person was convicted 
18 and was not an accessory or accomplice to the acts that were the basis of the conviction 
19 and resulted in a reversal or vacation of the judgment of conviction, dismissal of the charges 
20 or finding of not guilty on retrial; and
21 4.  The person did not commit or suborn perjury, fabricate evidence or by the person's 
22 own conduct bring about the conviction.
23 The bill provides that the person seeking compensation must file a claim with the 
24 District Court within a period of 2 years after the dismissal of the criminal charges or a 
25 finding of not guilty on retrial or 2 years from the effective date of the Maine Revised 
26 Statutes, Title 5, chapter 603 if the criminal charges were dismissed or the person received 
27 a finding of not guilty on retrial prior to the effective date of Title 5, chapter 603.
28 The bill assigns the determination of eligibility and compensation to the District Court, 
29 although the claim must be transferred to the Superior Court if the person requests a jury 
30 trial.  The person seeking compensation must also serve the claim on the Attorney General.
31 The bill establishes compensation of $50,000 for each year of imprisonment and 
32 $10,000 for each year served as a registered sex offender.
33 The bill provides that any monetary award already received by the claimant or a 
34 settlement received by the claimant reduces the compensation under Title 5, chapter 603.  
35 Subsequent awards or settlements result in the claimant's reimbursing the State for 
36 compensation paid under Title 5, chapter 603.
37 The bill provides that, if the court finds that the claimant is entitled to a judgment of 
38 compensation, the court is required to enter a certificate of innocence finding that the 
39 person was innocent of all crimes for which the person was mistakenly convicted and the 
40 court is required to order the associated conviction and arrest records expunged and purged 
41 from all applicable state and federal systems.
