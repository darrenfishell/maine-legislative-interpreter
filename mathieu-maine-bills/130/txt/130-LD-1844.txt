7 the application.
8Sec. 2.  12 MRSA §6072, sub-§4-B is enacted to read:
94-B.  Special fees.  If the commissioner determines that a particular application, by 
10 virtue of its size, uniqueness, complexity or other relevant factors, is likely to result in 
11 significantly greater cost to the department to process than can be offset by the fee 
12 established under subsection 4, the commissioner may designate that application as subject 
13 to special fees.  The commissioner shall make such a designation at, or prior to, the time 
14 the department determines the application is complete and may not base such a designation 
15 solely on the likelihood of extensive public controversy.  The maximum fee for processing 
16 an application that is subject to special fees may not exceed $250,000.  All staff of the 
17 department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the Department of 
18 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of Environmental Protection 
19 who have worked on the review of the application, including, but not limited to, 
20 preapplication consultations, shall submit quarterly reports to the commissioner detailing 
21 the time spent on the application and all expenses attributable to the application, including 
22 the costs of any appeals filed by the applicant and, after taking into consideration the 
23 interests of fairness and equity, any other appeals if the commissioner finds it in the public 
24 interest to do so.  Any appeal filed by the applicant of an application fee must be to the 
25 agency of jurisdiction of the application.  The processing fee for the application must be 
26 the actual cost to the department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the 
27 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of 
28 Environmental Protection.  The commissioner shall distribute the processing fee to each 
29 department that incurs a cost to be deposited in the account in which the expenses were 
30 incurred in that department to reimburse the actual cost to that department.  The 
31 commissioner shall bill the applicant quarterly, and the applicant shall pay all fees before 
32 the lease may be issued.
33Sec. 3.  12 MRSA §6072-A, sub-§14-A is enacted to read:
3414-A.  Special fees.  If the commissioner determines that a particular application, by 
35 virtue of its size, uniqueness, complexity or other relevant factors, is likely to result in 
36 significantly greater cost to the department to process than can be offset by the fee 
37 established under subsection 14, the commissioner may designate that application as 
38 subject to special fees.  The commissioner shall make such a designation at, or prior to, the 
39 time the department determines the application is complete and may not base such a 
40 designation solely on the likelihood of extensive public controversy.  The maximum fee 
41 for processing an application that is subject to special fees may not exceed $250,000.  All 
42 staff of the department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the Department 
43 of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of Environmental Protection 
44 who have worked on the review of the application, including, but not limited to,

48 interests of fairness and equity, any other appeals if the commissioner finds it in the public 
49 interest to do so.  Any appeal filed by the applicant of an application fee must be to the 
50 agency of jurisdiction of the application.  The processing fee for the application must be 
51 the actual cost to the department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the 
52 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of 
53 Environmental Protection.  The commissioner shall distribute the processing fee to each 
54 department that incurs a cost to be deposited in the account in which the expenses were 
55 incurred in that department to reimburse the actual cost to that department.  The 
56 commissioner shall bill the applicant quarterly and the applicant shall pay all fees before 
57 the lease may be issued.
13Sec. 4.  12 MRSA §6072-B, sub-§2, ¶A, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 231, §6, is 
14 amended to read:
