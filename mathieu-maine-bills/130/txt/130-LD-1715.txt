27SUMMARY
28 This bill amends the laws governing gross sexual assault, unlawful sexual contact and 
29 unlawful sexual touching to provide that when the actor is a teacher, employee or other 
30 official with instructional, supervisory or disciplinary authority over a student, such 
31 authority does not need to be possessed by the teacher, employee or other official at the 
32 time the act is committed. These laws apply to actors that are substitute teachers. The Maine 
33 Supreme Judicial Court held in State of Maine v. Conroy, 2020 ME 22, that such crimes, 
34 as defined by the Legislature, require that at the time of the sexual act or sexual contact the 
35 actor has instructional, supervisory or disciplinary authority over the student.28
