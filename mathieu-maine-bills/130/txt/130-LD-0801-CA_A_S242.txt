Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law requires a nonconcurrent sentence when a person is convicted of a crime committed while the person is 
serving their sentence on another conviction. The bill would allow an individual to serve a sentence concurrently 
under certain circumstances, reducing the amount of time individuals will be incarcerated and decreasing correctional 
costs. The amount of savings realized as a result of this bill will depend on how many individuals are sentenced to 
concurrent sentences. The current average cost of incarcerating an individual for one day in a correctional facility is 
$151.24, totaling $55,203 per year.
