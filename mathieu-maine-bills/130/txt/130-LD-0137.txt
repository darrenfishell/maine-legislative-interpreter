Page 1 - 130LR0837(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §809, sub-§7, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 218, §1, is amended 
3 to read:
4 B.  The employee presents a copy of the policy described in paragraph A to the 
5 employer upon within 30 days of notifying the employer of the employee's status as a 
6 firefighter or emergency medical services person within 30 days of employment or 
7 within 180 days of the effective date of this subsection.
8SUMMARY
9 Current law requires that, in order to avoid being subject to discharge or discipline for 
10 failure to report for work or being absent when responding to an emergency, an employee 
11 who is also a firefighter or emergency medical services person must have presented to the 
12 employer within 30 days of employment a copy of a fire department or emergency medical 
13 services provider policy that specifies the circumstances under which the employee is 
14 needed to respond to an emergency and that affirms that the employee will be released as 
15 soon as practicable.
16 This bill removes the requirement that the employee present the copy within 30 days 
17 of employment and instead requires that the employee present the copy within 30 days of 
18 notifying the employer of the employee's status as a firefighter or emergency medical 
19 services person.
