This bill directs the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW) to allow electronic registration of wild turkeys 
harvested. Under the current in-person tagging process, IFW receives information required to accurately account for 
the number of male wild turkeys taken each spring by age and wild management district and uses it to assess harvest 
impact on the population and set bag limits. To prevent losing this information from moving to an electronic process, 
the bill includes a one-time appropriation of $13,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 to provide monetary compensation to 
hunters who report the harvest of a banded wild turkey. This study would repeat in five-year increments and require 
additional funding in future years. The bill also includes a one-time appropriation of $3,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 for 
the communication costs of conducting a turkey hunter survey used to gauge registration accuracy.
