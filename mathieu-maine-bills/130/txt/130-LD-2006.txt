3Whereas, the price of home heating fuel has increased dramatically over the past year; 
4 and
5Whereas, there have been significant delays in providing Low-income Home Energy 
6 Assistance Program funds and processing and approving applications in a timely manner 
7 has been a challenge; and
8Whereas, it is essential to the health and safety of the elderly, the disabled and the 
9 most vulnerable in our State that the State provide funds to help speed the application 
10 process and provide emergency assistance; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  Payments or assistance not considered income or resources for any 
17purpose under state law. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary unless 
18 enacted in express limitation of this section, the amount of any home energy assistance 
19 payments or allowances provided directly to, or indirectly for the benefit of, a household 
20 under this Act may not be considered income or resources of that household or any member 
21 of that household for any purpose under any state law, including any law relating to 
22 taxation, food stamps, public assistance or welfare programs.
23Sec. 2.  Fund created. The Maine State Housing Authority shall create the Low-
24 income Home Energy Assistance Program Administrative Efficiency Fund.  This fund 
25 must be used for the purpose of increasing the capacity to accept and process applications 
26 in a timely manner for the current heating season.  This may include but is not limited to 
27 the hiring of temporary workers, purchasing technology or contracting with a 3rd party.  
28 The fund may also be used for providing resources to establish a long-term system to 
29 efficiently process Low-income Home Energy Assistance Program applications in future 
30 years.
31Sec. 3.  Unused funds. Any balance remaining of the funds provided in section 5 at 
32 the end of the fiscal year may be carried over to the next fiscal year for the same purpose.
33Sec. 4.  Working group.  The Maine State Housing Authority shall convene a working 
34 group to investigate ways to improve and increase the efficiency of the Low-income Home 
35 Energy Assistance Program administered through the United States Department of Health 
36 and Human Services. The working group must include representatives of community action 
37 programs and the Department of Health and Human Services; one or more individuals who 
38 have used the program; fuel providers; organizations that advocate for low-income to 
39 moderate-income households, economic justice or improved government operations; and 
40 any other individual or organization that the Maine State Housing Authority or the working 
41 group determines to be beneficial to the purposes of the working group. 
Page 2 - 130LR2548(01)1 The working group shall investigate how to reduce both the waiting times for 
2 application appointments and the time required to approve applications.  These 
3 investigations must include solutions using technology and the possibility of online 
4 applications and improving staffing levels and the ability to access information such as 
5 income information already on file with the Department of Health and Human Services. 
6 The working group also shall examine the practices of other states in the administration of 
7 their low-income home energy assistance programs. 
8 The working group shall provide a report no later than September 15, 2022 regarding 
9 how it plans to improve efficiency and reduce waiting times to the Joint Standing 
10 Committee on Labor and Housing.
