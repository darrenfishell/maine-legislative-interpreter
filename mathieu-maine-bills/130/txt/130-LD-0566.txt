Page 1 - 130LR1125(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง15682, as amended by PL 2011, c. 419, ยง2, is further amended 
3 to read:
4ยง15682.  Regional adjustment
5 The commissioner shall make a regional adjustment in the total operating allocation 
6 for each school administrative unit determined pursuant to section 15683.  The regional 
7 adjustment must be based on the regional differences in teacher salary costs, for labor 
8 market areas in which the school administrative unit is located, as computed by a statewide 
9 education policy research institute, and must be applied only to appropriate teacher salary 
10 and benefits costs as calculated under section 15678 and salary and benefit costs of other 
11 school-level staff who are not teachers as calculated under section 15679. Beginning in 
12 fiscal year 2012-13, and for each subsequent fiscal year, Except as provided in this section, 
13 the commissioner shall make a regional adjustment in the total operating allocation for each 
14 school administrative unit determined pursuant to section 15683. The regional adjustment 
15 must be based on the regional differences in teacher salary costs, for labor market areas in 
16 which the school administrative unit is located, as computed by a statewide education 
17 policy research institute, and must be applied only to appropriate teacher salary costs as 
18 calculated under section 15678 and salary costs of other school-level staff who are not 
19 teachers as calculated under section 15679.
20 Beginning in fiscal year 2024-25 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the commissioner 
21 may not make a regional adjustment that results in a decrease in a school administrative 
22 unit's allocation for teacher salary costs under section 15678 and salary costs of other 
23 school-level staff who are not teachers as calculated under section 15679.  For any school 
24 administrative unit for which the regional adjustment for fiscal year 2021-22 in the total 
25 operating allocation determined pursuant to section 15683 results in a decrease in the unit's 
26 allocation for teacher salary costs under section 15678 and salary costs of other school-
27 level staff who are not teachers as calculated under section 15679, the commissioner shall 
28 reduce the adjustment incrementally in fiscal years 2022-23 and 2023-24 to transition from 
29 the fiscal year 2021-22 adjustment amount to zero by fiscal year 2024-25.  For any school 
30 administrative unit for which the regional adjustment for fiscal year 2021-22 in the total 
31 operating allocation determined pursuant to section 15683 results in an increase in the unit's 
32 allocation for teacher salary costs under section 15678 and salary costs of other school-
33 level staff who are not teachers as calculated under section 15679, the commissioner shall 
34 set the adjustment in fiscal years 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 at the amount of the 
35 adjustment in fiscal year 2021-2022.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill requires that, beginning in fiscal year 2024-25, when the Commissioner of 
38 Education makes the regional adjustment in the total operating allocation for each school 
39 administrative unit, also known as the labor market adjustment, the commissioner may not 
40 make an adjustment in the total operating allocation that decreases a school administrative 
41 unit's allocation for teacher and other school-level staff salary costs.  The bill also requires 
42 the commissioner to reduce the adjustment incrementally to zero between fiscal years 
43 2021-22 and 2024-25 for any school administrative unit for which the regional adjustment 
44 in fiscal year 2021-22 results in a decrease in the unit's allocation for teacher and other 37

46 adjustment amount at the fiscal year 2021-22 amount for the subsequent 3 fiscal years for 
47 any school administrative unit for which the adjustment in fiscal year 2021-22 results in an 
48 increase in the unit's allocation for teacher and other school-level staff salary costs.1
