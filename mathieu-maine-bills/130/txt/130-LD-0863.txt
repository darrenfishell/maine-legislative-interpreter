2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill would enact the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact, an interstate 
6 compact designed to facilitate the practice of telepsychology and the temporary in-person, 
7 face-to-face practice of psychology across state boundaries, the verbatim, unedited text of 
8 which follows. 
9  
10ARTICLE I
11PURPOSE
12  
13 Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the public through verification of 
14 education, training and experience and ensure accountability for professional practice; and
15  
16 Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the day to day practice of telepsychology 
17 (i.e. the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies) by 
18 psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as 
19 assigned by an appropriate authority; and
20  
21 Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face 
22 practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a 
23 calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an 
24 appropriate authority;
25  
26 Whereas, this Compact is intended to authorize State Psychology Regulatory Authorities 
27 to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Compact, to 
28 psychologists licensed in another state;
29  
30 Whereas, this Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the 
31 public’s health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that 
32 such state regulation will best protect public health and safety;
33  
34 Whereas, this Compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the Home 
35 and Receiving States; and
36  
37 Whereas, this Compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice, it does 
38 allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.4
Page 2 - 130LR1180(01)1 Consistent with these principles, this Compact is designed to achieve the following 
2 purposes and objectives:
3  
4 1. Increase public access to professional psychological services by allowing for 
5 telepsychological practice across state lines as well as temporary in-person, face-
6 to-face services into a state which the psychologist is not licensed to practice 
7 psychology;
8  
9 2. Enhance the states’ ability to protect the public’s health and safety, especially 
10 client/patient safety;
11  
12 3. Encourage the cooperation of Compact States in the areas of psychology licensure 
13 and regulation;
14  
15 4. Facilitate the exchange of information between Compact States regarding 
16 psychologist licensure, adverse actions and disciplinary history;
17  
18 5. Promote compliance with the laws governing psychological practice in each 
19 Compact State; and
20  
21 6. Invest all Compact States with the authority to hold licensed psychologists 
22 accountable through the mutual recognition of Compact State licenses.

22 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or 
23 administrative proceeding in a Compact State pertaining to the subject matter of

25 Commission.
26 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such 
27 proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 
28 purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a

30 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
Page 33 - 130LR1180(01)1  
2 1. If the Commission determines that a Compact State has defaulted in the

11 terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the 
12 Compact States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact 
13 shall be terminated on the effective date of termination. A remedy of the default 
14 does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the 
15 period of default.
16 3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other 
17 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or 
18 terminate shall be submitted by the Commission to the Governor, the majority and 
19 minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the Compact 
20 States.
21 4. A Compact State which has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, 
22 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, 
23 including obligations which extend beyond the effective date of termination.
24 5. The Commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to 
25 be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon 
26 in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.
27 6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the 
28 U.S. District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the 
29 Compact has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs 
30 of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
