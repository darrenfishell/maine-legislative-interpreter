7 student or employee who shared the information and only if required by state or federal 
8 law;

12 licensed counselor in this State and the student engages the confidential resource 
13 advisor in that capacity.
147.  Notice.  Notice to a confidential resource advisor of an alleged incident of sexual 
15 misconduct or a confidential resources advisor's performance of a service under this section 
16 may not be considered actual or constructive notice of such an alleged incident to the 
17 institution of higher education at which the confidential resource advisor is employed or 
18 provides contracted services.
198.  Retaliation.  An institution may not discipline, penalize or otherwise retaliate 
20 against a confidential resource advisor for representing the interest of the student by 
21 advocating for the student's need for sexual assault crisis services or campus law 
22 enforcement services.
239.  Privileged communications.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 
24 except with regard to reporting, cooperating in an investigation or giving evidence pursuant 
25 to Title 22, chapter 958-A or 1071, or except at the request or with the consent of a victim 
26 of sexual assault, a confidential resource advisor may not be required to testify in any civil 
27 or criminal action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity about any information that the 
28 confidential resource advisor may have acquired in providing sexual assault counseling 
29 services.  A confidential resource advisor or a rape crisis center may not be required to 
30 disclose to the court any records, notes, memoranda or documents containing confidential 
31 communications.  When a court in the exercise of sound discretion determines the 
32 disclosure necessary to the proper administration of justice, information communicated to, 
33 or otherwise learned by, that confidential resource advisor in connection with the provision 
34 of sexual assault counseling services is not privileged and disclosure may be required.  
35 Nothing in this subsection prohibits a confidential resource advisor from testifying in a 
36 civil or criminal proceeding involving a person to whom the confidential resource advisor 
37 has provided services if that person has provided specific written consent to that 
38 confidential resource advisor.
3910.  Confidential criminal history record information.  Notwithstanding any 
40 provision of law to the contrary, a criminal justice agency, whether directly or through any 
41 intermediary, may disseminate confidential criminal history record information to a 
42 confidential resource advisor for the purpose of planning for the safety of a victim of sexual 
43 assault.  A confidential resource advisor who receives confidential criminal history record
