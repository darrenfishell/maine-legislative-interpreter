25 whether to award statutory damages and the amount of statutory damages, the court 
26 shall consider all relevant factors, including:
27 (1)  The frequency and persistence of violations by the mortgage servicer;
28 (2)  The nature of the violations;
29 (3)  The extent to which the violations were intentional; and
30 (4)  The extent to which the actions that constitute violations are prohibited by state 
31 or federal laws, rules or regulations, and the extent to which such actions constitute 
32 violations by the mortgage servicer of any consent judgments to which it is a party.
33 C.  If the court determines during a foreclosure action or an independent action for 
34 damages that there has been a violation of the duty of good faith:

36 of the obligation, any attorney's fees or costs incurred as a result of the violation or 
37 any other attorney's fees or costs incurred before the mortgage servicer cures the 
38 violation; and
39 (2)  The court shall order the mortgage servicer to pay to the obligor the obligor's

24 conduct by the entity being sanctioned and by others and may take into account prior orders 
25 imposing sanctions upon the sanctioned party, whether in the same case or in other previous 
26 cases.  The imposition of any sanction does not bar any independent action by a defendant 
27 to seek recovery with respect to the actions giving rise to the order of sanctions.

34 determination of net present value.  If the mediation did not result in the settlement or 
35 dismissal of the action, the report must include the outcomes of the Net Present Value 
36 Worksheet or other determination of net present value.  As part of the report, the mediator 
37 may notify the court if, in the mediator's opinion, either party failed to negotiate in good 
38 faith.  The mediator's report must also include a statement of all agreements reached at 
39 mediation, with sufficient specificity to put all parties on notice of their obligations under 
40 agreements reached at mediation, including but not limited to a description of all documents 
41 that must be completed and provided pursuant to the agreements reached at mediation and 
42 the time frame during which all actions are required to be taken by the parties, including 
43 decisions and determinations of eligibility for all loss mitigation options.  The mediator's

Page 4 - 130LR1165(01)45 subsection 1, paragraph B B-1 that participates in the mediation process, and any order of 
46 sanctions must likewise identify the name of the mortgage servicer.
