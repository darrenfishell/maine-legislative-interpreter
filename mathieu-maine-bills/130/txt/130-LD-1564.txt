3 protect the claimant's employment status by promptly notifying the employer of 
4 the need for time off, a change or reduction in hours or a shift change and being 
5 advised by the employer that the time off or change or reduction in hours or shift 
6 change cannot or will not be accommodated;
7 (2)  The leaving was necessary to accompany, follow or join the claimant's spouse 
8 in a new place of residence;
9 (3)  The leaving was in good faith in order to accept new employment on a 
10 permanent full-time basis and the new employment did not materialize for reasons 
11 attributable to the new employing unit;
12 (4)  The leaving was necessary to protect the claimant or any member of the 
13 claimant's immediate family from domestic abuse or the leaving was due to

17 preserve the employment; or
18 (5)  The claimant's employer announced in writing to employees that it planned to 
19 reduce the work force through a layoff or reduction in force and that employees 
20 may offer to be among those included in the layoff or reduction in force, at which 
21 time the claimant offered to be one of the employees included in the layoff or 
22 reduction in force and the claimant's employer accepted the claimant's offer, 
23 thereby ending the employment relationship. ; or

25 claimant was not at fault and for which no work alternatives such as changes in 
26 hours or a leave of absence or alternate child or elder care options were available 
27 despite good faith efforts made by the claimant to resolve the issue and continue 
28 working.
