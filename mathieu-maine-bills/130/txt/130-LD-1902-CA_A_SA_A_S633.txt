transfer from the General Fund unappropriated surplus to the Climate Education Professional Development Pilot 
Program Fund established within the Department of Education by that amount. It requires the State Controller to 
transfer $800,000 from the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund within the Maine Municipal Bond Bank and $200,000 
from certain enforcement settlement funds within the Office of the Attorney General to the pilot program fund. It also 
reduces by $905,981 the funding available for grants to school districts to partner with nonprofit community-based 
organizations.
