3§5412.  Easy enrollment program
4 The easy enrollment program is established under this chapter to identify residents of 
5 this State who are uninsured but qualify for benefits under the MaineCare program or a 
6 qualified health plan in the marketplace.
71.  Tax checkoff.  A person filing a tax return in this State pursuant to Title 36, chapter 
8 803 who has marked the relevant check-off boxes on the State income tax form as described 
9 in Title 36, section 5293 is identified as a person who may be determined eligible for 
10 benefits under the MaineCare program or to enroll in a qualified health plan in the 
11 marketplace.  The superintendent, in conjunction with the Department of Administrative 
12 and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue Services, shall determine by rule the 
13 information necessary to be shared with the marketplace to determine eligibility and the 
14 schedule regarding the frequency of transferring the information.
152.  Eligibility determination.  The marketplace shall determine whether the person 
16 filing the tax return under subsection 1 has an address in the State and whether the persons 
17 in the household indicated as uninsured are already enrolled in the MaineCare program or 
18 a qualified health plan in the marketplace.  The marketplace shall mail a notice to 
19 households with an address in the State and with persons in the household who are 
20 uninsured.  The notice must notify the person filing the tax return that the person or other 
21 uninsured members of the household may be eligible for health care coverage and provide 
22 information about the special enrollment period available on the marketplace pursuant to 
23 subsection 3 and that MaineCare enrollment is available at any time.  If the person filing 
24 the tax return has included an e-mail address, the marketplace shall also send an e-mail 
25 notice.
263.  Special enrollment period; assistance; coverage begins.  A person filing a tax 
27 return under subsection 1 who is determined eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan in 
28 the marketplace has a special enrollment period that begins on the date of the tax filing and 
29 ends 35 days from the date of the notice mailed by the marketplace to the person pursuant 
30 to subsection 2.  Once a person begins the application to enroll in a qualified health plan in 
31 the marketplace, the marketplace shall provide assistance through follow-up e-mails or 
32 other communications until the person is successfully enrolled or the marketplace 
33 determines that the person does not wish to enroll.  Coverage in the marketplace is effective 
34 on the first day of the month after the date a plan is selected by the person.
354.  Medicaid coverage; coverage begins.  If the marketplace determines that any 
36 member of the household is eligible for benefits under the MaineCare program under this 
37 section, the marketplace shall notify the department and the person who filed the tax return 
38 of the potential eligibility.  The department shall contact the person who filed the tax return 
39 and provide assistance with the MaineCare application unless the marketplace determines 
40 that the person does not wish to enroll.  For a person enrolled in the MaineCare program 
41 under this section, coverage begins on the first day of the month in which the person applied 
42 to enroll.
435.  Outreach efforts.  The marketplace, superintendent and department shall jointly 
44 develop educational materials and programming to communicate the purpose of the income 
Page 2 - 130LR1242(01)45 tax checkoff under Title 36, section 5293 and the benefits of enrolling in the MaineCare

19SUMMARY
20 This bill establishes a process to identify individuals and families who are uninsured 
21 but potentially eligible for benefits under the MaineCare program or enrollment in a 
22 qualified health plan in the Maine Health Insurance Marketplace through the state income 
23 tax filing system.  It requires the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
24 Bureau of Revenue Services to add check-off boxes to the state income tax form that allow 
25 an individual who is filing a state income tax return to identify that the individual or the 
26 individual's spouse or dependents are uninsured and authorize the bureau to share that 
27 information with the marketplace.  The marketplace must determine eligibility and follow 
28 up with the individual filing the tax return.  A special enrollment period on the exchange is 
29 available to the uninsured individuals.  The marketplace must offer assistance with the 
30 enrollment process for a qualified health plan and the Department of Health and Human 
31 Services must offer assistance with MaineCare enrollment.  Outreach materials and 
32 programming for educational purposes are developed by the Superintendent of Insurance 
33 within the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, the marketplace and the 
34 Department of Health and Human Services.  An advisory group is created to assist the 
35 superintendent with improving the effectiveness of the program.  The superintendent must 
36 submit an annual report with related data to the joint standing committees of the Legislature 
37 having jurisdiction over health insurance matters and MaineCare matters.20
