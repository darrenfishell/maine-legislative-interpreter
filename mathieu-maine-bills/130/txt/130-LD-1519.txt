32 of Civil Procedure unless otherwise ordered by the court. Service must be made by the 
33 delivery of a copy in hand to the defendant.

35 order or preliminary or permanent injunction issued under this chapter commits a Class D 
36 crime.

39 law.  For purposes of this chapter, rights secured under this chapter and the laws of the

41 governmental actors regardless of whether the specific interference complained of is 
42 performed or attempted by private parties.1

23 This bill enacts the Maine Workplace Transparency Act that ensures certain rights for 
24 employees subject to arbitration agreements as part of their employment.  The bill provides 
25 a list of unconscionable terms in an arbitration agreement that may not be used against 
26 employees and a list of rights for employees in their conduct in and out of the workplace.  
27 The bill provides the right to bring an action to dispute an unconscionable term or to enforce 
28 a right, including the issuance of a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or 
29 permanent injunction. The limitation period is 6 years, the burden of proof is by a 
30 preponderance of evidence and an employee may request a jury trial.  A violation of the

32 Department of Labor, and a violation of a court order for a temporary restraining order or 
33 a preliminary or permanent injunction is a Class D crime. The prevailing party in an action, 
34 except for the State, is entitled to receive attorney's fees and costs, and the State is liable 
35 for attorney's fees and costs in the same manner as a private party.23
