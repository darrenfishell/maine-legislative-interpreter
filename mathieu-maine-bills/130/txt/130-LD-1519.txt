23 considered the actions of the employer for purposes of liability; and a labor organization, 
24 whether or not organized on a religious, fraternal or sectarian basis, with respect to the

8 equitable relief, back pay damages, front pay damages, injunctive relief, including issuance 
9 of a temporary restraining order, or any other appropriate relief. 
102. Place of action. Notwithstanding the federal court's authority to exercise

29 under this chapter to the appropriate law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over a 
30 location where the defendant is alleged to have committed the act giving rise to the action, 
31 and service of the order or injunction must be accomplished pursuant to the Maine Rules 
32 of Civil Procedure unless otherwise ordered by the court. Service must be made by the 
33 delivery of a copy in hand to the defendant.
348. Violation of court order.  A person who knowingly violates a temporary restraining 
35 order or preliminary or permanent injunction issued under this chapter commits a Class D 
36 crime.
379. Protection against violation. The rights secured by this chapter are protected 
38 against violation due to nongovernmental discrimination and violation under color of state 
39 law.  For purposes of this chapter, rights secured under this chapter and the laws of the 
40 State include rights that would be protected from interference of the exercise of rights by 
41 governmental actors regardless of whether the specific interference complained of is 
42 performed or attempted by private parties.1

22SUMMARY
23 This bill enacts the Maine Workplace Transparency Act that ensures certain rights for 
24 employees subject to arbitration agreements as part of their employment.  The bill provides 
25 a list of unconscionable terms in an arbitration agreement that may not be used against 
26 employees and a list of rights for employees in their conduct in and out of the workplace.  
27 The bill provides the right to bring an action to dispute an unconscionable term or to enforce 
28 a right, including the issuance of a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or 
29 permanent injunction. The limitation period is 6 years, the burden of proof is by a 
30 preponderance of evidence and an employee may request a jury trial.  A violation of the 
31 provisions is subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 enforceable by the 
32 Department of Labor, and a violation of a court order for a temporary restraining order or 
33 a preliminary or permanent injunction is a Class D crime. The prevailing party in an action, 
34 except for the State, is entitled to receive attorney's fees and costs, and the State is liable 
35 for attorney's fees and costs in the same manner as a private party.23
