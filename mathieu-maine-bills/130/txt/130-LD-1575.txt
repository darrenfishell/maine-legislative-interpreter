3 amended to read:
43.  Other official documents.  An official document, including, but not limited to, a

6 statement, a government check, a paycheck, a student identification document with a 
7 photograph that is issued by a state-approved public or private school located in this State 
8 or that is issued by a duly authorized institution of higher learning that operates in this State 
9 or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter; or
10Sec. 2.  21-A MRSA §622-A, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 436, §85, is amended to 
11 read:
12§622-A.  Notice of election
13 The notice of election must contain the following items: a heading that states "Notice 
14 of Election" in bold type, the day, date and title of the election, the voting district 
15 designation, if any, the name and location of the voting place, the location of any ballot 
16 drop boxes, the opening and closing times of the polls and a list of the offices and 
17 referendum questions for that election.  The clerk may add times for in-person absentee 
18 voting and processing absentee ballots pursuant to section 759, subsection 7.
19Sec. 3.  21-A MRSA §627, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2007, c. 455, §24, is further 
20 amended to read:
214.  Minimum size of polling place; complaint to Secretary of State.  Municipalities 
22 must provide a polling place large enough to allow public observation.  The space must 
23 allow for at least one worker from each political party and one nonpartisan observer to 
24 remain outside the guardrail enclosure as a pollwatcher. If the municipality uses an 
25 incoming voting list for a polling place that is divided into separate segments by voting 
26 district or by the alphabetic listing of voters' names, then the municipality must allow at 
27 least one worker from each political party and one nonpartisan observer to remain outside 
28 the guardrail enclosure as a pollwatcher at each separate segment of the voting list.  Each 
29 polling place must allow reasonable access to members of the media.  Additional party 
30 workers and others nonpartisan observers are allowed if there is sufficient space at the 
31 polling place.  If the space at the polling place is so limited that the presence of the 
32 additional party workers and others nonpartisan observers would interfere with the election 
33 process, the warden shall prohibit their presence.  If the chair of any party's state committee 
34 or a representative of any organization that conducts nonpartisan election observation 
35 submits a written complaint to the Secretary of State at least 60 days before an election  
36 within 14 days of publication of the location of the polling place, the Secretary of State 
37 shall authorize an inspection of the polling place considered to be too small to allow party 
38 workers and nonpartisan observer access.  If the Secretary of State finds a polling place to 
39 be too small to allow party workers and nonpartisan observer access, the Secretary of State 
40 shall instruct the municipal officers to change the location of the polling place to one of a 
41 suitable size.  The municipal officers shall advertise the change of the polling place at least 
42 3 times in the daily or weekly newspaper, or both, that covers the area.
43Sec. 4.  21-A MRSA §753-B, sub-§2, ¶D, as amended by PL 2011, c. 534, §18, is 
44 further amended to read:
Page 2 - 130LR1290(01)1 D.  To any voter, immediate family member or 3rd person whose request was received 
2 in the municipal office after the 3rd on or after the final business day before election 
3 day, unless the voter signs an application, designed by the Secretary of State, stating 
4 one of the following reasons for requesting an absentee ballot after the deadline:
5 (1)  Unexpected absence from the municipality during the entire time the polls are 
6 open on election day;
7 (2)  Physical disability;
8 (3)  Inability to travel to the polls if the voter is a resident of a coastal island ward 
9 or precinct; or
10 (4)  An incapacity or illness that has resulted in the voter's being unable to leave 
11 home or a treatment facility.
12 The Secretary of State shall develop uniform language for a municipality to display 
13 describing the reasons a voter may request an absentee ballot after the deadline set forth 
14 in this paragraph.  A municipality shall use the uniform language on any signs at the 
15 municipal office and on any website, social media page or other media that the 
16 municipality uses to communicate election information.
17Sec. 5.  21-A MRSA §753-B, sub-§8, as amended by PL 2011, c. 399, §24, is 
18 further amended to read:
198.  Absentee voting in presence of clerk.  A person who wishes to vote by absentee 
20 ballot may, without completing an application, vote by absentee ballot in the presence of 
21 the clerk, except as provided in subsection 2.  For a municipality with more than 500 
22 registered voters, the clerk's office must be open for this purpose for no fewer than 4 hours 
23 on the Friday prior to the day of the election.  The method of voting is otherwise as 
24 prescribed in this article.  After the person has voted, the clerk shall sign the affidavit on 
25 the return envelope as a witness, indicate on the envelope that the voter voted in the 
26 presence of a clerk and ensure that the affidavit on the return envelope is properly 
27 completed by the voter.  For the 45 days preceding an election, during the hours when the 
28 clerk's office is open and may be conducting absentee voting, the display or distribution of 
29 any advertising material intended to influence a voter's decision regarding a candidate or 
30 question on the ballot for that election is prohibited within the clerk's office and on public 
31 property within 250 feet of the entrance to the building in which the clerk's office is located.
32 This subsection does not apply to the display or distribution of any campaign advertising 
33 material on private property that is within 250 feet of the entrance to the building in which 
34 the clerk's office is located.  For purposes of this section, "private property" includes 
35 privately owned property subject to a public right-of-way that is an easement right-of-way.
36 This subsection does not apply to campaign advertising material on automobiles traveling 
37 to and from the municipal office or parked on municipal property while the occupants are 
38 visiting the municipal office to conduct municipal business.  It does not prohibit a person 
39 who is at the municipal office for the purpose of conducting municipal business or for 
40 absentee voting from wearing a campaign button when the longest dimension of the button 
41 does not exceed 3 inches.
42Sec. 6.  21-A MRSA §754-A, sub-§1, ¶D, as amended by PL 2019, c. 371, §36, is 
43 further amended to read:
Page 3 - 130LR1290(01)1 D.  The voter or an immediate family member of the voter shall return the sealed 
2 envelope containing the voted ballot to the clerk of the municipality where the voter 
3 resides by mail, by personal delivery or by depositing it into a secured drop box 
4 accessible by only the municipal clerk.  The voter shall send a completed voter 
5 registration or absentee ballot application, if necessary, in a separate envelope.  The 
6 Secretary of State shall adopt rules regarding the design and use of secured drop boxes, 
7 including access to and security of secured drop boxes, and the chain of custody for 
8 ballots placed in secured drop boxes.  The rules must allow a municipality to have 
9 multiple secured drop boxes.
10Sec. 7.  21-A MRSA §756, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2009, c. 538, §9, is further 
11 amended to read:
122.  Clerk to examine signatures and affidavit.  The clerk shall compare the signature 
13 of the voter on the application, where required, with that on the corresponding return 
14 envelope.  The clerk shall examine the affidavit on the return envelope.  If the signatures 
15 appear to have been made by the same person and if the affidavit is properly completed, 
16 the clerk shall write "OK" and the clerk's initials on the return envelope.  Otherwise, the 
17 clerk shall note any discrepancy on the return envelope.  If there is a signature discrepancy 
18 or missing signature, the clerk shall immediately notify the voter and provide an 
19 opportunity for the voter to cure the ballot under procedures directed by the Secretary of 
20 State. The Secretary of State shall adopt rules for ballot curing procedures.
21 A.  If the signatures do not appear to have been made by the same person, but this 
22 discrepancy is apparently the result of the voter's having properly obtained assistance 
23 under either section 753‑A, subsection 5, or section 754‑A, subsection 3, or both, then 
24 the clerk shall note the discrepancy on the return envelope, but shall also write "OK" 
25 and the clerk's initials on the return envelope.
26Sec. 8.  21-A MRSA §759, sub-§7, as amended by PL 1997, c. 436, §113, is further 
27 amended to read:
287.  Processing before close of polls.  A If the municipal clerk does not intend to process 
29 absentee ballots prior to election day pursuant to section 760-B, a notice signed by the 
30 municipal clerk must be posted at least 7 days before election day in the same manner as 
31 posting the notice of election, under section 621‑A, stating each specific time that the clerk 
32 intends to begin processing absentee ballots on election day.  The warden shall follow the 
33 procedures required by subsections 1 to 6 5 to process absentee ballots before the close of 
34 the polls.  The clerk shall notify the chairs of each political party of the municipality, in 
35 writing, that this procedure is to occur.  This notice must be considered sufficient as long 
36 as it is mailed to the last address of each municipal chair that is known to the clerk.
37Sec. 9.  21-A MRSA §760-A, first ¶, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 459, §82, is 
38 amended to read:
39 The clerk shall use the following procedure when processing the absentee ballots at a 
40 central location on election day.

12 days of the publication date of polling locations.
13 4.  It changes the closed period when no-excuse absentee voting is no longer permitted 
14 from after the 3rd business day before the election to on or after the last business day before 
15 the election.

28 signatures do not match and must provide the voter an opportunity to correct the ballot.  
29 The Secretary of State is required to adopt rules regarding this process.
30 9.  It clarifies the laws governing the processing of absentee ballots on election day.
