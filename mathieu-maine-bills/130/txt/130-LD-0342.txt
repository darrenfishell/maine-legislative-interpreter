2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §6024, sub-§1-A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 225, §3, is further 
3 amended to read:
41-A.  Appointment; composition; term; compensation.  The Marine Resources 
5 Advisory Council, established by Title 5, section 12004‑G, subsection 27, consists of 15  
6 16 members.  The chair of the Lobster Advisory Council, the chair of the Sea Urchin Zone 
7 Council and the chair of the Shellfish Advisory Council are ex officio members of the 
8 council.  Each other member is appointed by the Governor and is subject to review by the 
9 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over marine resources 
10 matters and to confirmation by the Legislature.  Five members must be persons who are 
11 licensed under this Part to engage in commercial harvesting activities.  Those 5 members 
12 are selected by the Governor from names recommended to the Governor by groups 
13 representing commercial harvesting interests.  Each member must represent a different 
14 commercial harvesting activity, except that none of those 5 members may represent lobster 
15 harvesters.  The remaining 7 8 members must include one public member, one member 
16 who is a member of the Wabanaki Tribes, 4 persons who hold a nonharvesting-related 
17 license under this Part, one person representing recreational saltwater anglers and one 
18 person representing the aquaculture industry.  The Governor shall select the person to 
19 represent the aquaculture industry from among the names recommended by the aquaculture 
20 industry.  The Governor shall select the member who is a member of the Wabanaki Tribes 
21 based on the recommendation of the tribal governments of the Wabanaki Tribes, including

23 Passamaquoddy Tribe at Motahmikuk, the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Sipayik and the 
24 Penobscot Nation.  In recommending the appointment of the member who is a member of 
25 the Wabanaki Tribes, the tribal governments of the Wabanaki Tribes shall establish a 
26 process that provides for the membership to rotate among the tribal governments.  The 
27 composition of the council must reflect a geographical distribution along the coast.  All 
28 appointed members are appointed for a term of 3 years, except a vacancy must be filled in 
29 the same manner as an original member for the unexpired portion of the term.  An appointed 
30 member may not serve for more than 2 consecutive terms.  Appointed members serve until 
31 their successors are appointed.  The chair of the Lobster Advisory Council, the chair of the 
32 Sea Urchin Zone Council and the chair of the Shellfish Advisory Council shall serve until 
33 a new chair of the Lobster Advisory Council, a new chair of the Sea Urchin Zone Council 
34 or a new chair of the Shellfish Advisory Council, respectively, is chosen.  Members are 
35 compensated as provided in Title 5, chapter 379.
