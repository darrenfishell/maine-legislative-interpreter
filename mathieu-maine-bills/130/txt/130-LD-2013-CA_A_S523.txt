10 Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Contamination in the State" 
11 Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the following: 
12 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
13 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
14 Whereas, the contamination of soil and water in the State from perfluoroalkyl and 
15 polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, poses a significant threat to the environment of the 
16 State and to the health of its citizens; and 
17 Whereas, the full extent of PF AS contamination in the State is not presently known 
18 but is anticipated to be widespread and to require a significant expenditure of resources to 
19 identify and remediate; and 
20 Whereas, all of the State's farm economy is being harmed by PF AS either directly or 
21 indirectly and the longer it takes to complete soil, water and food testing, the more 
22 uncertainty and turmoil will be felt across all of Maine's agricultural sector; and 
23 Whereas, farmland cannot be sold while under the cloud of contamination from so-
24 called forever chemicals, investments will not be made and consumer anxiety about the 
25 safety of local foods, whether justified or not, will only increase; and 
26 Whereas, all Maine agriculture is being and will be negatively affected until all 
27 possible PF AS contamination sites are identified and tested and food production is moved 
28 away from contaminated soil and water; and 
29 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
30 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
31 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
3 2 therefore,' 
33 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
34 following:
