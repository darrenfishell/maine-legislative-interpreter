7 to an employee while the employee is working in a high-heat environment.  An 
8 employer shall locate drinking water as close as practicable to the area where an 
9 employee is working and provide the drinking water to the employee without 
10 charge.  If drinking water is not continuously supplied, the employer shall ensure 
11 that each employee working in a high-heat environment is provided with at least 
12 one quart of drinking water per hour for every hour in the employee's work day.
13 (2)  If an employee exhibits mild to moderate signs or symptoms of heat illness, an 
14 employer or supervisor shall remove the employee from the high-heat

17 medical attention is necessary.  If the employee's signs or symptoms of heat illness 
18 do not abate within 15 minutes, an employer or supervisor shall seek medical

23 while an employee is working in a high-heat environment, maintain one or more 
24 cooling areas sufficient to enable employees to participate in recovery periods.
25 (4)  When the temperature is 90 degrees or greater, an employer shall implement 
26 the following heat illness prevention procedures, to the extent practicable:
27 (a)  Ensure that an employee working in a high-heat environment may easily 
28 communicate by voice, gesture or electronic means with an employer or 
29 supervisor so that the employee may easily report signs or symptoms of heat 
30 illness or request emergency medical services;
31 (b)  Regularly remind an employee working in a high-heat environment to 
32 consume drinking water;
33 (c)  Ensure that an employee takes at least one 10-minute recovery period every 
34 2 hours while working in a high-heat environment, which may be concurrent 
35 with rest breaks required under section 601; and
36 (d)  Before an employee begins working in a high-heat environment, review 
37 the employer's heat illness prevention procedures with the employee.
38 C.  Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, an employee is responsible for 
39 monitoring the employee's own personal risk factors for heat illness.
404.  Rulemaking.  The Department of Labor shall adopt rules to implement this section,
