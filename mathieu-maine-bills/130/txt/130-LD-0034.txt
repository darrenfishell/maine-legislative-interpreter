3ยง8869-B.  Maine Forestry Operations Cleanup and Response Fund
4 The Maine Forestry Operations Cleanup and Response Fund, referred to in this section 
5 as "the fund," is established to be used by the bureau as a nonlapsing, revolving fund for 
6 carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.  The balance in the fund is limited to $20,000.  
7 To this fund are credited permit fees, civil penalties and other fees and charges related to 
8 this subchapter.  To this fund are charged expenses of the bureau incurred to mitigate and 
9 remediate damages or potential damages to waters of the State created by violations of this 
10 subchapter, including but not limited to costs of cleanup of discharges of pollutants to 
11 waters of the State and the restoration of water supplies.
121.  Disbursements from fund.  Money in the fund may be disbursed only for costs, 
13 including without limitation payments to contractors undertaking mitigation and 
14 remediation activities and equipment expenses, involved in the control of sediment and 
15 water flow, the abatement of pollution and the implementation of remedial measures, 
16 including restoration of water supplies, related to the discharge of sediment and other 
17 pollutants discharged or at risk of discharging to waters of the State by timber harvesting 
18 activities.
192.  Reimbursements to the fund.  The following provisions govern reimbursements 
20 to the fund.
21 A.  For the use of the fund, the director shall seek recovery of disbursements from the 
22 fund from the responsible party, unless the bureau finds the amount involved too small, 
23 the likelihood of success too uncertain or that recovery of costs is unlikely due to the 
24 inability of the responsible party to pay those costs.
25 B.  Requests for reimbursement to the fund, if not paid within 30 days of demand, may 
26 be turned over to the Attorney General for collection or may be submitted to a 
27 collection agency or agent or an attorney retained by the department with the approval 
28 of the Attorney General in conformance with Title 5, section 191, or the bureau may 
29 file suit in District Court.
303.  Lien.  All costs incurred by the State to mitigate and remediate damages or potential 
31 damages to waters of the State created by violations of this subchapter under subsection 1 
32 and interest on those costs are a lien against the real estate of the responsible party.  A 
33 certificate of lien signed by the director must be sent by certified mail to the responsible 
34 party prior to being recorded and may be filed in the office of the clerk of the municipality 
35 in which the real estate is located.  The lien is effective when the certificate is recorded 
36 with the registry of deeds for the county in which the real estate is located.  The certificate 
37 of lien must include a description of the real estate, the amount of the lien and the name of 
38 the owner as grantor.
39 When the amount for which a lien has been recorded under this subsection has been paid 
40 or reduced, the director, upon request by any person of record holding interest in the real 
41 estate that is the subject of the lien, shall issue a certificate discharging or partially 
42 discharging the lien.  The certificate must be recorded in the registry in which the lien was 
43 recorded.  Any action of foreclosure of the lien must be brought by the Attorney General 
Page 2 - 130LR0127(01)44 in the name of the State in the Superior Court for the judicial district in which the real estate 
45 subject to the lien is located.

5 nonlapsing, dedicated revenue fund for the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
6 Forestry, Bureau of Forestry to use to mitigate and remediate water quality violations that
