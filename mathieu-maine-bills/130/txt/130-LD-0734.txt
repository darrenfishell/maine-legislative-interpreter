Page 1 - 130LR0713(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง4014 is enacted to read:
3ยง4014.  Minimum wage for school support staff
41.  Minimum wage.  For the school year starting after June 30, 2022, and for each 
5 subsequent school year, the minimum hourly wage for school support staff is $16 per hour.  
6 For the purposes of this section, "school support staff" means a public school employee 
7 who is not an administrator, as defined in section 13001-A, subsection 1, or a certified 
8 teacher subject to the minimum salary requirement pursuant to section 13407.
9Sec. 2.  State contribution.  For the school year starting after June 30, 2022 only, 
10 notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A, chapter 606-B, the State shall 
11 provide 100% of the additional funding necessary to achieve the minimum hourly wage for 
12 school support staff established under Title 20-A, section 4014.  The Department of 
13 Education shall determine the additional funding necessary to achieve the minimum hourly 
14 wage for school support staff for each school administrative unit through the collection of 
15 data from school administrative units.  A school administrative unit shall provide to the 
16 Department of Education on or before October 1, 2021 the current wage per hour paid to 
17 school support staff eligible for the minimum wage established in Title 20-A, section 4014.
18SUMMARY
19 This bill establishes a minimum hourly wage of $16 per hour for school support staff 
20 for school years beginning after June 30, 2022.  The bill requires the State on a one-time 
21 basis, for the school year beginning after June 30, 2022, to provide funds to school 
22 administrative units to make up the difference between what a school administrative unit 
23 currently pays school support staff and what the unit is required to pay under the minimum 
24 wage requirement.
