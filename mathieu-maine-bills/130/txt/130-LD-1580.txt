41.  Duties.  A mobile home park owner or operator shall:
5 A.  Comply with codes, statutes, ordinances and administrative rules applicable to 
6 mobile home parks;
7 B.  Maintain all common areas of the mobile home park in a clean and safe condition

15 E.  Provide reliable sewage disposal that is adequate to meet the needs of all the 
16 residents in the mobile home park;
17 F.  Maintain and protect all utilities provided to a mobile home and keep water and

21 G.  Maintain in a safe and secure location individual mailboxes for the residents;
22 H.  Maintain roads and, if present, sidewalks within the mobile home park in good and 
23 safe condition.  This maintenance includes snow removal and adequate drainage.  The 
24 mobile home park owner or operator is responsible for damage to any vehicle that is 
25 the direct result of any unrepaired or poorly maintained access road within the mobile 
26 home park;
27 I.  Take reasonable steps to exterminate insects, rodents, vermin or other pests 
28 dangerous to the health and safety of a resident whenever infestation exists on the 
29 common premises or in the interior of a mobile home as a result of infestation existing 
30 on the common premises;
31 J.  Maintain the premises and regrade them when necessary to prevent the accumulation 
32 of stagnant water and the detrimental effects of moving water;
33 K.  Take all necessary steps to maintain the integrity of the foundation of a resident's 
34 mobile home;
35 L.  Keep the common areas of the mobile home park free from any species of weed or

37 M.  Provide for the removal of garbage, rubbish and other waste incidental to the

39 N.  Cooperate with and assist residents in applying for property tax abatements, as

Page 2 - 130LR0786(01)1 O.  Comply with mobile home park rules and require other persons on the premises 
2 with the consent of the mobile home park owner or operator to comply with those rules 
3 and conduct themselves in a manner that does not unreasonably disturb the mobile 
4 home park residents or constitute a breach of the peace.
52.  Notice to residents prior to interruption in utility service.  The mobile home park 
6 owner or operator shall give individual written notice to residents no less than 72 hours 
7 prior to an interruption in utility service when the interruption is not due to an emergency 
8 or circumstances beyond the owner's or operator's control.
93.  Authorization for others to make repairs; emergency repairs.  The mobile home 
10 park owner or operator shall authorize a manager, assistant manager or other employee to 
11 make repairs that are the responsibility of the mobile home park owner or operator or enter 
12 into a contract with a 3rd party for such repairs.  The mobile home park owner or operator 
13 shall contract with a 3rd party to provide emergency repairs that are the responsibility of 
14 the mobile home park owner or operator on occasions when the manager, assistant manager 
15 or other designated employee is not physically present in the mobile home park and shall 
16 notify each resident in writing of the telephone number where the 3rd party may be reached 
17 directly.
184.  Self-help for defects.  If the mobile home park owner or operator fails to comply 
19 with subsection 1 or 3, a resident may recover damages for the breach and also may notify 
20 the mobile home park owner or operator of the resident's intention to correct the condition 
21 at the mobile home park owner's or operator's expense.  After being notified by the resident 
22 in writing, if the mobile home park owner or operator fails to comply within 15 days or 
23 more promptly as conditions reasonably require in case of emergency, the resident may 
24 cause the work to be done by a contractor and, after submitting to the mobile home park 
25 owner or operator an itemized statement, deduct from the resident's rent the actual and 
26 reasonable costs of the repair.
27Sec. 2.  10 MRSA ยง9100-B is enacted to read:
28ยง9100-B.  Mobile home park rules
291.  Mobile home park owner or operator may promulgate rules.  The community 
30 mobile home park owner or operator may promulgate rules governing the rental occupancy 
31 of a mobile home lot and the use of common areas and facilities, but a rule may not be 
32 unreasonable, unfair or unconscionable.
332.  Rules that do not apply uniformly.  A rule that does not apply uniformly to all 
34 mobile home residents of a similar class creates a rebuttable presumption that the rule is 
35 unfair.
363.  Rules must be enforced uniformly.  All rules must be enforced uniformly as to all 
37 residents to whom they apply.
384.  Common area facilities.  Each common area facility must be open or available to 
39 residents at all reasonable hours, and the hours of a common recreational facility must be 
40 posted at the facility.
415.  Guests and visitors.  The mobile home park owner or operator may not prohibit 
42 residents from having such guests and visitors as they choose.  The mobile home park 
43 owner or operator may forbid a guest or visitor who has violated a rule or engaged in 
44 disorderly conduct or a crime in the mobile home park.
Page 3 - 130LR0786(01)16.  Rule change; approval by resident association.  If a bona fide resident association 
2 exists for a mobile home park, then a change in a rule may not be implemented without the 
3 approval of that association.  If such approval is withheld, the mobile home park owner or 
4 operator may initiate a procedure to determine if the change in the rules should be 
5 implemented by notifying the resident association of its intent to submit the dispute to 
6 arbitration.  The resident association may elect to resolve the dispute instead through a 
7 court proceeding or submission of the dispute to an appropriate municipal board designated 
8 by the municipal legislative body to conduct such an appeal hearing.  If the arbitrator, court 
9 or appropriate municipal board finds that the rule change is unreasonable, unfair or 
10 unconscionable, it may not be implemented.
117.  Rule change may not take effect until at least 60 days after notice to residents.  
12 Except in a bona fide emergency, a change in a rule may not take effect until at least 60 
13 days after the residents receive notice of the change.
148.  Maintenance.  A mobile home park owner's or operator's rules may require 
15 residents to maintain their mobile homes but may not require residents to replace or remove 
16 older mobile homes or to make upgrades or improvements to a mobile home that are not 
17 related to health or safety.
189.  Judicial review of rule.  Whenever a rule is enforced against a resident, the resident 
19 may seek judicial review of that rule.
2010.  Prohibited rules.  Rules that do the following are prohibited:
21 A.  Restrict babysitting;
22 B.  Require the purchase of equipment from one particular vendor;
23 C.  Deny a resident the opportunity to take appurtenances when that resident leaves the 
24 mobile home park;
25 D.  Impose restrictions on the number of people living in a mobile home that are more 
26 stringent than those required by law;
27 E.  Impose construction standards that are more stringent than state or federal 
28 standards;
29 F.  Ban mobile homes from the mobile home park based on the age of those mobile 
30 homes; and
31 G.  Require the purchase of unreasonably expensive equipment for aesthetic purposes.
