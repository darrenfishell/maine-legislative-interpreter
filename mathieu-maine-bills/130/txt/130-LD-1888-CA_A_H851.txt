SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. It amends the title to reflect that, as amended, the 
legislation applies to petitions to determine parental rights and responsibilities. 
The amendment provides express authority for a court to order a forensic risk 
assessment in a parental rights and responsibilities proceeding. The assessment must be 
performed by a licensed clinical social worker, psychologist or psychiatrist qualified to 
perform psychosexual evaluations. 
In determining whether to order an assessment, the court may consider the existence 
of comt findings, including convictions for child-related sexual offenses, dissemination of 
sexually explicit material or possession of sexually explicit material, substantiated findings 
of child abuse or neglect involving child-related sexual offenses or sexual exploitation of a 
minor, a recommendation for the assessment by a guardian ad litem and any other factor 
the court considers relevant. The court may order that the person performing the forensic 
risk assessment may interview certain parents and have access to court documents, records 
of any interview with the child and other relevant documents. 
The comt must order the parent who is ordered to complete the forensic risk assessment 
to pay all the fees associated with the assessment unless another parent agrees to pay for 
the assessment. 
If the parent has already completed a forensic risk assessment in the past year, the court 
may order the parent to release the assessment to the comt, the guardian ad litem or another 
party and may require the parent to complete a new assessment only if the court determines 
a new assessment is necessary.
