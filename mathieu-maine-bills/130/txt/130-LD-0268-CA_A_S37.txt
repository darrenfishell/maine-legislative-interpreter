This bill eliminates the $7 fee the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) charges for 
electronically issued bum permits via its online permit system. Currently, $4 is deposited into the General Fund, $2 is 
transferred to the municipality where the permit was issued and $1 goes to InforME for the administrative cost of the 
online permit system. In unorganized areas, $6 of the fee is deposited into the General Fund and $1 is for the 
administrative costs ofinforME. Elimination of the fee reduces annual General Fund revenue by $32,354 in fiscal 
year 2021-22 and $43,139 in fiscal year 2022-23, reduces revenue to municipalities by approximately $20,000 a year 
and reduces revenue available to pay InforME by $9,600. The bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations to 
ACF of $7,200 in fiscal year 2021-22 and $9,600 in fiscal year 2022-23 to continue to pay InforME for bum permits 
issued through the state online system. Municipalities may incur additional costs if a vendor or owner of a private 
party bum permit software system charges for use of its software.
