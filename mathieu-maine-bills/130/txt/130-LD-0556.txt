Page 1 - 130LR0565(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §2748, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1985, c. 516, §3, is amended 
3 to read:
42.  Limits; coinsurance; copayments; deductibles.  Any Except as provided in this 
5 subsection, any contract which that provides coverage for the services required by this 
6 section may contain provisions for maximum benefits and coinsurance and reasonable 
7 limitations, deductibles and exclusions to the extent that these provisions are not 
8 inconsistent with the requirements of this section or the limitations, coinsurance, 
9 deductibles or exclusions imposed on other providers.  A contract may not contain a 
10 provision for a copayment or coinsurance requirement for a health care service or procedure 
11 provided by a chiropractic provider unless the copayment or coinsurance requirement does 
12 not exceed the copayment or coinsurance requirement applicable to the same service or 
13 procedure provided by a primary care provider in the insurer's provider network.  A 
14 profession-specific manipulation code may not authorize a copayment or coinsurance 
15 requirement that exceeds the copayment or coinsurance requirement for an evaluation and 
16 management service when performed by a primary care provider in the insurer's provider 
17 network.
18Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §2748, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 111, §1 and affected 
19 by §4, is amended to read:
205.  Reimbursement; discrimination.  An insurer subject to this section may not refuse 
21 to reimburse a chiropractic provider who participates in the insurer's provider network for 
22 providing a health care service or procedure covered by the insurer as long as the 
23 chiropractic provider is acting within the lawful scope of that provider's license in the 
24 delivery of the covered service or procedure.  Consistent with reasonable medical 
25 management techniques specified under the insurer's contract with respect to the method, 
26 treatment or setting for a covered service or procedure, the insurer may not discriminate 
27 based on the chiropractic provider's license.  This subsection does not require an insurer to 
28 accept all chiropractic providers into a network or govern the amount of the reimbursement 
29 paid to a chiropractic provider, except as provided in subsection 2.
30Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §2840-A, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1985, c. 516, §5, is 
31 amended to read:
322.  Limits; coinsurance; copayments; deductibles.  Any Except as provided in this 
33 subsection, any contract which that provides coverage for the services required by this 
34 section may contain provisions for maximum benefits and coinsurance and reasonable 
35 limitations, deductibles and exclusions to the extent that these provisions are not 
36 inconsistent with the requirements of this section.  A contract may not contain a provision 
37 for a copayment or coinsurance requirement for a health care service or procedure provided 
38 by a chiropractic provider unless the copayment or coinsurance requirement does not 
39 exceed the copayment or coinsurance requirement applicable to the same service or 
40 procedure provided by a primary care provider in the insurer's provider network.  A 
41 profession-specific manipulation code may not authorize a copayment or coinsurance 
42 requirement that exceeds the copayment or coinsurance requirement for an evaluation and 
43 management service when performed by a primary care provider in the insurer's provider 
44 network.
Page 2 - 130LR0565(01)1Sec. 4.  24-A MRSA §2840-A, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 111, §2 and 
2 affected by §4, is amended to read:
35.  Reimbursement; discrimination.  An insurer subject to this section may not refuse 
4 to reimburse a chiropractic provider who participates in the insurer's provider network for 
5 providing a health care service or procedure covered by the insurer as long as the 
6 chiropractic provider is acting within the lawful scope of that provider's license in the 
7 delivery of the covered service or procedure.  Consistent with reasonable medical 
8 management techniques specified under the insurer's contract with respect to the method, 
9 treatment or setting for a covered service or procedure, the insurer may not discriminate 
10 based on the chiropractic provider's license.  This subsection does not require an insurer to 
11 accept all chiropractic providers into a network or govern the amount of the reimbursement 
12 paid to a chiropractic provider, except as provided in subsection 2.
13Sec. 5.  24-A MRSA §4236, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2015, c. 111, §3 and 
14 affected by §4, is further amended to read:
152.  Benefits; discrimination.  The health maintenance organization shall provide 
16 benefits covering care by chiropractic providers at least equal to and consistent with the 
17 benefits paid to other health care providers treating similar neuro-musculoskeletal 
18 conditions.  A health maintenance organization may not refuse to reimburse a chiropractic 
19 provider who participates in the health maintenance organization's provider network for 
20 providing a health care service or procedure covered by the health maintenance 
21 organization as long as the chiropractic provider is acting within the lawful scope of that 
22 provider's license in the delivery of the covered service or procedure. Consistent with 
23 reasonable medical management techniques specified under the health maintenance 
24 organization's contract with respect to the method, treatment or setting for a covered service 
25 or procedure, the health maintenance organization may not discriminate based on the 
26 chiropractic provider's license. This subsection does not require a health maintenance 
27 organization to accept all chiropractic providers into a network or govern the 
28 reimbursement paid to a chiropractic provider, except as provided in subsection 4.
29Sec. 6.  24-A MRSA §4236, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
304.  Copayments; coinsurance.  A health maintenance organization contract may not 
31 contain a provision for a copayment or coinsurance requirement for a health care service 
32 or procedure provided by a chiropractic provider unless the copayment or coinsurance 
33 requirement does not exceed the copayment or coinsurance requirement applicable to the 
34 same service or procedure provided by a primary care provider in the health maintenance 
35 organization's provider network.  A profession-specific manipulation code may not 
36 authorize a copayment or coinsurance requirement that exceeds the copayment or 
37 coinsurance requirement for an evaluation and management service when performed by a 
38 primary care provider in the health maintenance organization's provider network.
39Sec. 7.  Application.  The requirements of this Act apply to all individual and group 
40 policies, contracts and certificates issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State 
41 on or after January 1, 2022.  For purposes of this Act, all contracts are deemed to be 
42 renewed no later than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.
