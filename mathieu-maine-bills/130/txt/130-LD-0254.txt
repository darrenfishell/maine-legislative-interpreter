Page 1 - 130LR0399(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA ยง4320-P is enacted to read:
3ยง4320-P.  Coverage for services provided by a certified registered nurse anesthetist
41.  Services provided by a certified registered nurse anesthetist.  A carrier offering 
5 a health plan in this State shall provide coverage for health care services performed by a 
6 certified registered nurse anesthetist licensed under Title 32, chapter 31 when those services 
7 are covered services under the health plan when performed by any other health care 
8 provider and when those services are within the lawful scope of practice of the certified 
9 registered nurse anesthetist.
102.  Limits; deductible; copayment; coinsurance.  A carrier may offer a health plan 
11 containing a provision for a deductible, copayment or coinsurance requirement for a health 
12 care service provided by a certified registered nurse anesthetist as long as the deductible, 
13 copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or coinsurance 
14 applicable to the same service provided by other health care providers.
153.  Network participation.  A carrier may not prohibit a certified registered nurse 
16 anesthetist from participating in the carrier's provider network or billing the carrier directly 
17 solely because the provider is a certified registered nurse anesthetist as long as the provider 
18 is willing to meet the same terms and conditions as other participating providers. This 
19 subsection does not require a carrier to contract with all certified registered nurse 
20 anesthetists or require a carrier to provide coverage under a health plan for any service 
21 provided by a participating certified registered nurse anesthetist that is not a covered service 
22 under the plan.
234.  Claim submission.  Services billed by a certified registered nurse anesthetist must 
24 be submitted using the current standardized claim form for professional services approved 
25 by the Federal Government and submitted electronically.
26Sec. 2.  Application. This Act applies to all policies, contracts and certificates 
27 executed, delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after 
28 January 1, 2023. For purposes of this Act, all contracts are deemed to be renewed no later 
29 than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.
30Sec. 3.  Exemption from review.  Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, 
31 Title 24-A, section 2752, this Act is enacted without review and evaluation by the 
32 Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance.
33SUMMARY
34 This bill requires health insurance carriers to provide coverage for services provided 
35 by certified registered nurse anesthetists if those services are within a certified registered 
36 nurse anesthetist's scope of practice and are covered services under a health plan.  The bill 
37 makes the requirement applicable to policies, contracts and certificates executed, issued or 
38 renewed on or after January 1, 2023.
