An Act To Reorganize the Provision of Services fo r Infants, Toddlers and Children with Disabilities 
from Birth to 6 Years of Age and Extend the Age of Eligibility under the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act to 22
Fiscal Note for Original Bill
Committee: Education Committee
Fiscal Note Required: Yes
Under current law, services for infants, toddlers and childre n with disabilities from birth to 6 years of age is provided 
through the Child Development Services System (CDS) wh ich receives General Fund appropriations of approximately 
$39.7 million per year along with approximately $5.3 million annually in federal funds. This legislation reorganizes 
how services to these children are provided and extends the age that a child with a disability is eligible to receive 
services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Ac t from age 21 to age 22. The bill requires the Department 
of Education to develop projections for the total cost of  this reorganization and to report to the joint standing 
committee having jurisdiction over education matters on the cost and proposed funding mechanisms by November 2, 
2022 If the projected costs exceed current funding levels , additional General Fund appropriations will be required.
As part of the reorganization, the bill requires school administrative units (SAU's) to assume responsibility for 
identifying and providing free, appropriate public educati on (FAPE) for children with disabilities from 3 years of age 
to under 6 beginning July 1, 2024 using their own employees or through contracts with public or private providers 
(SAU's are allowed to contract with the Child Developmen t Services System until July 1, 2026) only if funding is 
provided to cover the total costs to SAU's through a funding formula to be developed by th e Department of Education. 
The bill allows for funds appropriated to the current Child  Development Services System program for children with 
disabilities from 3 years of age to under 6 to be reallo cated through a reimbursement model developed by the 
department to SAU's beginning July 1, 2024.
This legislation also repeals the current Child Development Services System and replaces it with a State Intermediate 
Educational Unit (SIEU) established as a public instrumenta lity of the State responsible for identifying, evaluating and 
providing early intervention services to eligible infant s and toddlers with disabilities from birth to under age 3 and 
their families effective July 1, 2026. The bill requires the Department of Education to develop a funding mechanism 
for the SIEU to be in place by that effective date.
This bill requires the Department of Education to pay 100% of  the costs for compensatory services for children with a 
disability from 3 years of age to under 6 years of age who have been underserved through the current model from fiscal year 2022-23 through fiscal  year 2025-26. This requirement is expected to result in additional costs to the State, 
but the total impact can not be estimated at this time.
LR2686(01) - Fiscal Note - Page 1 of 2
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services from the provisions of this bill are expected to 
be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
