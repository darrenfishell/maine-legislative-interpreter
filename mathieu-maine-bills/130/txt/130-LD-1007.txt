Page 1 - 130LR1034(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA ยง4316, sub-ยง2, as corrected by RR 2019, c. 2, Pt. A, ยง28, is 
3 amended to read:
42.  Parity for telehealth services.  A carrier offering a health plan in this State may 
5 not deny coverage on the basis that the health care service is provided through telehealth if 
6 the health care service would be covered if it were provided through in-person consultation 
7 between an enrollee and a provider.  Coverage for health care services provided through 
8 telehealth must be determined in a manner consistent with coverage for health care services 
9 provided through in-person consultation.  If an enrollee is eligible for coverage and the 
10 delivery of the health care service through telehealth is medically appropriate, a carrier may 
11 not deny coverage for telehealth services, including services provided under Title 32, 
12 section 60-O. A carrier may offer a health plan containing a provision for a deductible, 
13 copayment or coinsurance requirement for a health care service provided through telehealth 
14 as long as the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, 
15 copayment or coinsurance applicable to a comparable service provided through in-person 
16 consultation.  A carrier may not exclude a health care service from coverage solely because 
17 such health care service is provided only through a telehealth encounter, as long as 
18 telehealth is appropriate for the provision of such health care service.
19Sec. 2.  32 MRSA c. 1-A, sub-c. 4 is enacted to read:
20SUBCHAPTER 4
21TELEHEALTH
22ยง60-O.  Telehealth
23 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a licensee or registrant under 
24 chapters 2, 9, 22, 32, 45-A, 51, 56, 71-A, 81, 83, 97, 103, 104, 113-B, 117, 119, 127-A and 
25 137 to the extent practicable may provide necessary health care or other services through 
26 the use of all modes of telehealth, including visual and audio, audio-only or other electronic 
27 media.  For purposes of this section, "telehealth" means the use of interactive real-time 
28 visual and audio or other electronic media for the purpose of consultation and education 
29 concerning and diagnosis, treatment, care management and self-management of an 
30 enrollee's physical and mental health and includes real-time interaction between the 
31 enrollee and the telehealth provider, synchronous encounters, asynchronous encounters, 
32 store and forward transfers and telemonitoring.  This section does not expand the scope of 
33 practice for any licensee or registrant under this Title.
34SUMMARY
35 This bill makes permanent the Governor's Executive Order #35 dated April 6, 2020, 
36 which allows certain licensed or registered professionals under Title 32 of the Maine 
37 Revised Statutes to provide necessary health care or other services to the extent practicable 
38 through the use of all modes of telehealth, including visual and audio, audio-only or other 
39 electronic media.  The bill also clarifies that these services must be covered by insurance 
40 as they would be if provided in person.35
