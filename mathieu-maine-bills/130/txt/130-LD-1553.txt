26 This bill requires all chiropractic services that are within the scope of practice of 
27 chiropractic doctors and performed by a licensed chiropractic doctor to be reimbursed

29 Services is required to reimburse for only chiropractic evaluation and management

32 plan amendment to allow for Medicaid reimbursement for all chiropractic services within

34 amendment is not approved by the United States Department of Health and Human 
35 Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, chiropractic doctors will not be 
36 reimbursed by the MaineCare program for any additional chiropractic services not 
37 currently eligible for reimbursement.
