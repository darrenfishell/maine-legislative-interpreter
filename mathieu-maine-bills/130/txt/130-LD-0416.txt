9Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
10Sec. 1.  7 MRSA c. 103, sub-c. 8-C is enacted to read:
11SUBCHAPTER 8-C
12BIRCH SYRUP PRODUCTS
13§901.  Exposed for sale
14 For purposes of this subchapter, any birch syrup products governed by this subchapter 
15 that are packed in any type or kind of container and found in any place in the State, whether 
16 a warehouse, packing house or place where birch syrup products are stored, are deemed to 
17 be exposed for sale.
18§902.  Labeling of birch syrup
19 All containers of birch syrup sold or offered for sale for human consumption must be 
20 labeled with the volume, name and address of the producer or packer, together with the 
21 producer's or packer's seal in a manner approved by the commissioner on the cap of the 
22 container, which must be affixed so that the container cannot be opened until the seal is 
23 broken.  Any marking that indicates pure Maine birch syrup must be used exclusively for 
24 pure birch syrup produced in this State that has not been bleached or lightened in color by 
25 artificial means.
26 The words "Maine Birch" may not be used alone or in combination with other words 
27 on a label or container to designate the flavor of the contents unless all of the birch flavoring 
28 of the contents is a pure birch produced in this State.
29§903.  Labeling containers
30 A person may not sell or offer for sale in any place or serve in any hotel, restaurant or 
31 other public eating place any birch sugar, birch confection or candy or birch syrup or any 
32 product labeled or represented as such that is in any way combined, interfused or diluted 
33 with cane or other sugars or other substance without distinctly marking, stamping or 
34 labeling the article or the package containing cane or other sugars or other substance or the 
35 advertisement of or menu statement with an accurate and descriptive name of the article 
36 and, in the case of birch sugar and birch syrup, the percentage in which birch sugar or birch 
37 syrup enters into its composition.  In the case of birch confection or candy, the ingredients 
38 must be listed in the order of the volume of each ingredient with the ingredient of greatest 
39 volume listed first.  The words "birch," "birched" and "birching" and words of similar 
Page 2 - 130LR1413(01)40 import, except as printed in the percentage statement, may not appear in any manner on the 
41 article in which a product of birch syrup is combined, interfused or diluted, unless the word 
42 "blend" appears immediately before, after, above or below and in equal prominence with 
43 the word "birch" or words of similar import, or unless the term "birch flavored" appears in 
44 similar fashion on the label.
6§904.  Enforcement; jurisdiction
7 The commissioner shall enforce this subchapter.  The commissioner or the 
8 commissioner's designee must have free access to any place or building, store, gift shop or 
9 any other building where birch syrup or birch syrup products are packed, stored, 
10 transported, sold or offered or exposed for sale or for transportation.  The commissioner or 
11 the commissioner's designee may open any container and may upon tendering the market 
12 price take samples.  The commissioner may recover fines imposed for a violation under 
13 this subchapter in a civil action and if the commissioner prevails in that action may recover 
14 full costs.
15 All fines for violations under this subchapter must be paid to the Treasurer of State and 
16 appropriated for enforcing this subchapter.
17 The commissioner shall adopt rules to implement this subchapter.  Rules adopted 
18 pursuant to this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
19 subchapter 2-A.
