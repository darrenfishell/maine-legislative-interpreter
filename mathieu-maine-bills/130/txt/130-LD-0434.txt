Page 1 - 130LR1164(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA ยง939 is enacted to read:
3ยง939.  Bonding for capital maintenance projects
4 Notwithstanding any county charter provision to the contrary except as set forth in this 
5 section, a county board of commissioners may issue tax-supported bonds, notes or other 
6 securities and financial instruments of the county for capital maintenance projects in any 
7 year in an amount up to 1/10 of one mill based upon the county's property valuation or in 
8 a greater amount if the amount is specified in the county charter or upon approval through 
9 a county bond referendum election.
10SUMMARY
11 This bill authorizes a county to issue bonds for capital maintenance projects in a single 
12 year without the need for a bond issue referendum, as long as the total amount of the bonds 
13 does not exceed 1/10 of one mill of the county's property valuation.  If a county charter 
14 provision provides for a higher total amount of bonds that may be issued for such projects 
15 without a bond issue referendum, that charter provision is valid.
