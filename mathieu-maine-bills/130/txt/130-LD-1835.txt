Page 1 - 130LR2262(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, multiple projects involving the construction or management of mountain 
4 bike trails of statewide significance to Maine's recreational economy may be adversely 
5 affected by delay if those trails are subject to storm water management requirements; and
6Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
8 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
9 therefore,
10Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
11Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §420-D, sub-§7, ¶J is enacted to read:

14 mountain bikes;
15 (2)  The trail is generally constructed and maintained in accordance with best 
16 management practices for motorized trails established by the Department of 
17 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, including requirements to provide 
18 sediment and erosion control;
19 (3)  The trail creates a treadway surface of not more than 6 feet in width; and
20 (4)  The trail corridor does not exceed 8 feet in width.
21 For the purposes of this paragraph, "mountain bike" means a bicycle designed for off-
22 road cycling and "treadway surface" means the part of a trail upon which a person 
23 travels.
