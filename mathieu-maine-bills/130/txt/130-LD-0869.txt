4 psychiatric hospital or receive court-ordered treatment in the community are inconsistent;

6Whereas, the inconsistency is preventing access to timely treatment for individuals 
7 in crisis, and a more streamlined process could reduce the consequences of delayed 
8 treatment or lack of treatment; and
9Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
11 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
12 therefore, be it
