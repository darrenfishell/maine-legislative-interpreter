Page 1 - 130LR1146(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §123 is enacted to read:
3§123.  Statewide, multi-use online energy data platform
4 The commission shall establish and operate a statewide, multi-use online energy data 
5 platform, referred to in this section as "the platform," that provides natural gas utility and 
6 investor-owned transmission and distribution utility customers with safe, secure access to 
7 information about their energy usage and that allows for the aggregation of and removal of 
8 personally identifiable information from community-level energy data. In establishing the 
9 platform, the commission shall review similar online energy data platforms established by 
10 other states. 
111.  Platform requirements.  The platform must:
12 A.  Consist of a common base of energy data for use in a wide range of applications 
13 and for a wide range of business purposes;
14 B.  Adhere to specific and well-documented standards for data accuracy, retention, 
15 availability, privacy and security;
16 C.  Provide a user-friendly interface;
17 D.  Adhere to a common statewide logical data model that defines the relationships 
18 among the various categories of data included in the platform;
19 E.  Allow for the sharing of an individual utility customer’s energy data with 3rd parties 
20 only with the express consent of the utility customer; and
21 F.  Protect utility customers from unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable 
22 information and ensure customer privacy rights.
232.  Platform creation and operation; assessment.  The commission may hire an 
24 outside entity to create and operate the platform. All costs to create and operate the platform 
25 are funded through an assessment on the ratepayers of natural gas utilities and investor-
26 owned transmission and distribution utilities and are to be collected by the utilities. The 
27 commission shall determine the amount of the assessment on a yearly basis. All amounts 
28 collected under this subsection must be transferred to the commission. The funds collected 
29 from utilities under this subsection are just and reasonable costs for rate-making purposes 
30 and must be reflected in the rates of natural gas utilities and investor-owned transmission 
31 and distribution utilities. If a consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility elects 
32 to participate in sharing data, the ratepayers of that consumer-owned transmission and 
33 distribution utility are subject to an assessment under this subsection, the amount of which 
34 must be determined by the commission.
353.  Participating utilities.  A natural gas utility and an investor-owned transmission 
36 and distribution utility shall participate in data sharing pursuant to this section.  A 
37 consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility may elect to participate in data 
38 sharing pursuant to this section. If a consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility 
39 elects to participate, that utility is subject to all the requirements of this section. 
404.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section. The rules must 
41 include specific requirements to protect a utility customer’s privacy and define the 
42 acceptable methods for a customer to give express consent to allow the customer's energy 
Page 2 - 130LR1146(01)43 usage data to be shared with 3rd parties. The rules must identify those 3rd parties that will 
44 be permitted to access the data on the platform. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection 
45 are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
4Sec. 2.  Platform certification; rules.  When initially adopting rules pursuant to 
5 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 123 for the establishment of a statewide, 
6 multi-use online energy data platform, the Public Utilities Commission shall ensure those 
7 rules allow that platform to meet the requirements for certification from the Green Button 
8 Alliance and to support the Energy Service Provider Interface of the North American 
9 Energy Standards Board and the Green Button "Connect My Data" standard of the Green 
10 Button Alliance. In developing those rules, the commission shall seek input from natural 
11 gas utilities and investor-owned and consumer-owned transmission and distribution 
12 utilities, the Office of the Public Advocate, the Governor’s Energy Office, the Efficiency 
13 Maine Trust and municipalities.
14SUMMARY
15 This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish and operate a statewide, 
16 multi-use online energy data platform that will provide natural gas and electric utility 
17 customers with safe, secure access to information about their usage and allow for the 
18 aggregation of and removal of personally identifiable information from community-level 
19 energy data.  It allows the commission to hire an outside entity to create and operate the 
20 platform and specifies that the costs of the creation and operation of the platform are funded 
21 through an assessment on the ratepayers of natural gas and investor-owned transmission 
22 and distribution utilities. It allows a consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility 
23 to elect to share data through the platform subject to the same requirements placed on 
24 natural gas and investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities. It requires the 
25 commission to adopt routine technical rules, which must include provisions to protect the 
26 privacy of utility customers. It requires when rules are initially adopted that the commission 
27 ensure that the platform created is able to meet the requirements for certification from the 
28 Green Button Alliance and supports the Energy Service Provider Interface of the North 
29 American Energy Standards Board and the Green Button "Connect My Data" standard of 
30 the Green Button Alliance. Lastly, it requires in developing the rules that the commission 
31 seek input from all natural gas and investor-owned and consumer-owned transmission and 
32 distribution utilities, the Office of the Public Advocate, the Governor’s Energy Office, the 
33 Efficiency Maine Trust and municipalities.1
