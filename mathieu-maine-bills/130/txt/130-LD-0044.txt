121.  Program fund.  "Program fund" means the Summer Success Pilot Program Fund 
13 established in section 8812.
142.  Summer success pilot program.  "Summer success pilot program" means a pilot 
15 program offered by a public school that provides traditional and alternative teaching 
16 methods to ensure that every student has access to a high-quality extended school year 
17 program that helps the student improve the student's academic achievement and addresses 
18 the needs of the student to demonstrate content area proficiency based on the student's 
19 grade level.
20§8812.  Summer Success Pilot Program Fund
211.  Establishment.  The Summer Success Pilot Program Fund is established as a

25 the program fund. 
263.  Application of program fund.  Money in the program fund must be continuously 
27 applied by the commissioner to carry out this section and may not be used for any other 
28 purpose.  A school administrative unit shall ensure that program funds made available to 
29 the school administrative unit to provide grants for access to summer success pilot 
30 programs for elementary and secondary school students supplement and do not supplant 
31 federal funding.
32§8813.  Standards; approval
33 The commissioner shall use the program fund to encourage the facilitation of high-

37 1 for summer school programs offered at elementary or secondary schools in the State.  In 
Page 2 - 130LR0428(01)38 establishing standards for summer success pilot programs, the commissioner may also 
39 consider the following:
3 A.  Guidelines similar to, but not identical with, the requirements of the community 
4 learning centers program authorized under Title IV, Part B of the federal Elementary 
5 and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the federal Every Student 
6 Succeeds Act, 20 United States Code, Chapter 70, to help students improve their 
7 academic achievement by providing educational opportunities that close the 
8 achievement gap between high-performing and low-performing students, including the 
9 gap between economically disadvantaged students and their peers;
10 B.  Effective models of summer success programs that improve student achievement, 
11 including model programs that involve networking and partnerships with 
12 community-based organizations that provide a range of high-quality services to support 
13 student learning and development.  In order to partner with a summer success pilot 
14 program, a community-based organization must be exempt from federal income 
15 taxation under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Section 501(a), 
16 pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Section 501(c)(3); and
17 C.  Implementation of the formative and summative assessment methods used by a 
18 school administrative unit during the school year to measure student achievement in 
19 order to monitor the progress of students in that school administrative unit who are 
20 participating in the summer success pilot programs.
212.  Approval.  A summer success pilot program may be offered by a school 
22 administrative unit with the approval of the commissioner.  The commissioner may inspect

24 certificate to a school that maintains approval standards under subsection 1.  The 
25 department shall pay the expense of the inspection.
26§8814.  Program fund grants; eligibility
271.  Program fund grants.  Beginning in fiscal year 2021-22 and each subsequent year, 
28 the department, through a grant application process, shall provide from the program fund 
29 funding to cover 90% of the costs of summer success pilot programs in school 
30 administrative units.  Those school administrative units with greater than 50% student 
31 participation in the federal free and reduced-price lunch program pursuant to section 6602, 
32 subsection 1, paragraph A must be given priority in the distribution of funding from the 
33 program fund.
342.  Eligibility.  To receive program fund money, a school administrative unit must be 
35 in compliance with any applicable standards and program requirements for summer success 
36 pilot programs established by the commissioner pursuant to section 8813.
37§8815.  Report
38 The department shall report by June 30, 2022 and annually thereafter to the joint 
39 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over education and cultural 
40 affairs on the number of school administrative units administering summer success pilot 
41 programs, the nature of the summer success pilot programs receiving money from the
