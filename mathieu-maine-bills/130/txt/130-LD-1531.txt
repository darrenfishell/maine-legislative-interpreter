Page 1 - 130LR0972(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease referred to as COVID-19 has 
4 created a public health emergency; and
5Whereas, in response to COVID-19, the World Health Organization has declared a 
6 pandemic, the President of the United States has declared a national emergency and the 
7 Governor of Maine has declared a civil state of emergency; and
8Whereas, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the need for behavioral health 
9 treatment, especially among young people in the State; and
10Whereas, in response to COVID-19, it is important for young people in the State to 
11 have access to behavioral health treatment without financial barriers; and
12Whereas, the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that young people in the State 
13 have access to expanded behavioral health treatment services until December 31, 2026; and
14Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
15 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
17 therefore,
18Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
19Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §4320-A, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 653, Pt. C, §1, is 
20 amended to read:
213.  Primary health services; behavioral health services in 2021 to 2026.  An 
22 individual or small group health plan with an effective date on or after January 1, 2021 
23 must provide coverage without cost sharing for the first primary care office visit and first 
24 behavioral health office visit in each plan year and may not apply a deductible or 
25 coinsurance to the 2nd or 3rd primary care and 2nd or 3rd behavioral health office visits in

27 2021 and until the end of plan year 2026, an individual or small group health plan must 
28 provide coverage without cost sharing for an enrollee under 26 years of age for up to 6 
29 behavioral health office visits in each plan year and may not apply a copayment, a

31 for the 2nd or 3rd primary care and 2nd or 3rd behavioral health office visits in a plan year 
32 count toward the deductible. This subsection does not apply to a plan offered for use with

34 benefits required by this section are permissible benefits in a high deductible health plan as 
35 defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Section 223(c)(2).  The 
36 superintendent shall conduct a study analyzing the effects of this subsection on premiums 
37 based on experience in plan years 2020 and 2021.  The superintendent may adopt rules as 
38 necessary to address the coordination of the requirements of this subsection for coverage 
39 without cost sharing for the first primary care visit and the requirements of this section with 
40 respect to coverage of an annual well visit. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are 
41 routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
