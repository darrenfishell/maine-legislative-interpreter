Page 2 - 130LR0481(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill amends the Maine Criminal Code to specify that storing or leaving a loaded 
3 firearm on premises under a person's control when the person knows or reasonably should 
4 know that a child is likely to gain access to that firearm, and the child in fact gains access 
5 to the loaded firearm and uses it, is considered endangering the welfare of a child and is a 
6 Class D crime.  The bill provides a number of affirmative defenses to the crime, including 
7 that the firearm is stored in a locked box or locked gun safe, the child uses the firearm in 
8 self-defense or defense of others, the person has no reasonable expectation that a child will 
9 be on the premises and the firearm is obtained by the child as the result of a crime. 2
