Whereas, the decision in Canterbury v. Spence, 464 F.2d 772 (D.C. Cir. 1972), 
establishing the concept of informed consent in medical treatment, has become a bedrock 
principle of the laws of this country and of each state; and 
Whereas, the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 2.1.1 
recognizes the right of an individual to be fully informed of a recommended medical 
treatment to allow the individual to make an informed decision regarding the individual's 
course of treatment, including whether to obtain or decline a particular medical treatment; 
and 
. Whereas, under 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 482.13, a hospital is 
required as a condition of participation in Medicare to have in place a process for obtaining 
the informed consent of a patient before providing treatment to the patient and to ensure 
the patient or the patient's representative, as allowed by state law, has the right to make 
informed decisions regarding the patient's care; and 
Whereas, although the United States Supreme Court upheld mandatory vaccination 
policies imposed by state and local governments to combat smallpox in Jacobson v.

Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), the United States Supreme Court recognized in 
Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980) that a state may provide 
individual liberties more expansive than those conferred by the United States Constitution; 
and 
Whereas, persons inside and outside this State have sought or are seeking to compel 
or coerce individuals lawfully residing in this State to be vaccinated against COVID-19 
contrary to their preferences; and 
Whereas, any attempt to compel or coerce an individual lawfully residing in this State 
to be vaccinated against COVID-19 contrary to the individual's preferences is inconsistent 
with the principles of informed consent; and 
Whereas, the COVID-19 vaccine carries the risk of injury and death to both healthy 
and vulnerable individuals; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
