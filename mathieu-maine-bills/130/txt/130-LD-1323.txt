Page 1 - 130LR1456(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §1002, sub-§1, ¶A, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 128, §1, is 
3 amended to read:
4 A.  "Employee" means a person who receives ongoing monetary payment or benefits , 
5 no matter the amount paid or hours worked, for personal services performed for a 
6 school administrative unit.
7Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §1002, sub-§1, ¶A-1 is enacted to read:
8 A-1.  "Stipend employee" means a person who receives limited monetary payment or 
9 benefits, through a series of payments or in a lump sum, for personal services 
10 performed in an advisory, mentoring or coaching capacity for a school administrative 
11 unit. 
12Sec. 3.  20-A MRSA §1002, sub-§2, as amended by PL 1999, c. 128, §2, is further 
13 amended to read:
142.  Employment by school administrative unit, school union, academy.  A member 
15 of a school board or spouse of a member may not be an employee in a public school within 
16 the jurisdiction of the school board to which the member is elected or in a contract high 
17 school or academy located within a supervisory union in which the member is a 
18 representative on the union committee.  The spouse of a member of a school board may 
19 serve as a stipend employee on a contractual basis when that action is in the best interest 
20 of students and a summation of potential conflicts of interest is documented and a priori 
21 mitigations are described in the signed contract.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to 
22 the contrary, a school administrative unit must have a written policy on nepotism that 
23 includes hiring practices for school-sanctioned stipend positions, which must provide all 
24 qualified applicants with fair and equal opportunity to be selected on merit, with priority 
25 consideration being the best interest of students, and that does not include unnecessary 
26 restrictions based solely on family association.
27Sec. 4.  20-A MRSA §1002, sub-§2-A, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 128, §3, is 
28 amended to read:
292-A.  Volunteer placement by school administrative unit, school union, academy.  
30 A member of a school board or member's spouse may not serve as a volunteer when that 
31 volunteer has primary responsibility for a curricular, cocurricular or extracurricular 
32 program or activity and reports directly to the superintendent, principal, athletic director or 
33 other school administrator in a public school within the jurisdiction of the school board to 
34 which the member is elected or in a contract high school or academy located within a 
35 supervisory union in which the member is a representative on the school committee.  
36 Volunteer activities of a member of a school board or member's spouse, other than in roles 
37 that are prohibited by this subsection, may be prescribed by policies developed and 
38 approved by the school board of the school administrative unit.  The school administrative 
39 unit's written policy on nepotism under subsection 2 must discourage favoritism and 
40 political patronage, consider the needs of the school system and permit voluntary 
41 placements, with all qualified applicants having fair and equal opportunity to be selected 
42 on merit and with priority consideration given to the best interest of students, and may not 
43 include unnecessary restrictions based solely on family association.
Page 2 - 130LR1456(01)1SUMMARY
2 Current law prohibits school board members and their spouses from participation in a 
3 school activity, whether as a volunteer or for payment.  This bill limits that prohibition to 
4 board members only and requires for paid positions that a summation of potential conflicts 
5 of interest be documented and a priori mitigations be described in the signed contract.  It 
6 also requires for both paid and volunteer positions a written policy on nepotism that 
7 discourages favoritism and provides that all qualified applicants have fair and equal 
8 opportunity to be selected on merit and with priority consideration given to the best interest 
9 of students.  The written policy on nepotism may not include unnecessary restrictions based 
10 solely on family association.2
