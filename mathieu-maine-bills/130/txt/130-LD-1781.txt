4SUMMARY
5 The purpose of this bill is to align state law with the requirements under federal law in 
6 order to avoid delays in implementation and provide a more efficient rollout of technology 
7 and rulemaking without changes to existing appropriations and allocations. The bill 
8 accomplishes the following.
9 1. It repeals provisions enacted by Public Law 2021, chapter 461 that expand 
10 postpartum MaineCare coverage for a qualified woman and a noncitizen legally admitted 
11 to the United States from 6 months to 12 months on a graduated schedule between January 
12 1, 2022 and July 1, 2023.
13 2. It expands postpartum MaineCare coverage for a qualified woman and a noncitizen 
14 legally admitted to the United States to 12 months beginning August 1, 2022.
15 3. It expands a qualified woman's eligibility for postpartum MaineCare coverage by 
16 increasing the nonfarm income official poverty line requirement from 200% to 209%.
17 4. It clarifies that in order to receive postpartum MaineCare coverage a noncitizen 
18 legally admitted to the United States must otherwise be eligible for MaineCare.
19 5. It repeals Public Law 2021, chapter 461, section 8, which requires the Department 
20 of Health and Human Services to file any necessary state plan amendments by January 1, 
21 2022 regarding the extension of postpartum coverage under the MaineCare program in that 
22 law, and enacts a similar provision that instead requires the department to file any necessary 
23 state plan amendments no later than 30 days after the effective date of this legislation 
24 regarding the postpartum coverage provisions of this legislation.
25 The legislation applies retroactively to January 1, 2022, the date of the requirement to 
26 file a state plan amendment pursuant to Public Law 2021, chapter 461.1
