5 retired teachers at the beginning of the next fiscal year; and
6Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as

9 therefore,

21 Except for individuals who are receiving or who have received retirement benefits under 
22 Title 5, section 17907 or 17929, for a teacher who retires after July 1, 2012, the State shall 
23 begin paying the percentage of the retired teacher member's share pursuant to this

26 the State's total cost for retired teachers' health insurance premiums is budgeted at the fiscal

28 State's total cost for retired teachers' health insurance premiums for fiscal years ending after

30 Index as defined in Title 5, section 17001, subsection 9 plus 3%.  A provider of a health 
31 insurance benefit plan for retired teachers must make available data related to the provider's

38 group accident and sickness or health insurance after June 30, 2021.  It also removes some 
39 outdated language.
