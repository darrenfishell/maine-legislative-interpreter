36SUMMARY
37 This bill provides for open primary elections for the elections for United States Senator, 
38 United States Representative to Congress, Governor, State Senator and State 
39 Representative.  All of the candidates for those offices, including candidates enrolled in a 
40 party and unenrolled candidates, must appear on the same open primary ballot.  All 37
38
39
40
Page 15 - 130LR0799(01)41 qualified voters, regardless of enrollment status, are eligible to vote in open primary 
42 elections.
3 The votes in an open primary election must be tabulated using ranked-choice voting, 
4 except that the 2 candidates who receive the most votes are declared the winners of the 
5 open primary and their names must appear on the ballot for the general election. If one of 
6 the 2 candidates who received the most votes at the open primary dies or becomes 
7 disqualified before the general election, that candidate's name must remain on the ballot 
8 and the voters must be notified that a vote for that candidate will be counted and, if that 
9 candidate is declared the winner of the election, a vacancy will be declared at the beginning 
10 of the term of the office for which the candidate was elected.  Voters may not vote for a 
11 write-in candidate in a general election that was preceded by an open primary election.  As 
12 a result, ranked-choice voting will no longer be used in general elections for United States 
13 Senator and United States Representative to Congress.  Instead, the candidate who receives 
14 a plurality of votes at the general election will be elected to those offices.
15 The bill also changes the date of the State's presidential primary election from the 
16 Tuesday after the first Monday in March to the 2nd Tuesday of June of the presidential 
17 election year, the same day that the primary elections for United States Senator, United 
18 States Representative to Congress and state offices are held.1
