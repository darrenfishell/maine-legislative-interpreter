3CHAPTER 908-B
4PROPERTY TAX STABILIZATION FOR SENIOR CITIZENS
5ยง6281.  Stabilization of property taxes on homesteads of individuals 65 years of age or 
6older
71.  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
8 following terms have the following meanings.
9 A.  "Eligible homestead" means a homestead occupied by an eligible individual who is 
10 eligible for a homestead exemption under chapter 105, subchapter 4-B for the property 
11 tax year during which an application for stabilization is made.
12 B.  "Eligible individual" means an individual who:
13 (1)  Is 65 years of age or older; and
14 (2)  Is a permanent resident of the State as defined in section 681, subsection 4 who 
15 has owned a homestead in the State for at least 10 years.
16 C.  "Homestead" has the same meaning as under section 681, subsection 2.
17 D.  "Stabilize" means to maintain the property tax billed to an eligible individual for 
18 the individual's eligible homestead at the amount billed for that homestead for the 
19 property tax year preceding the date of application for stabilization.
202.  Application for stabilization.  An individual may apply by December 1st to the 
21 municipality in which the individual's homestead is located requesting that the municipality 
22 stabilize the property tax assessed on that individual's homestead for the property tax year 
23 beginning on April 1st following the submission of the application.  A new application is 
24 required for each year for which stabilization is requested.
253.  Stabilization for eligible individual.  If a municipality determines that an applicant 
26 for stabilization under subsection 2 is an eligible individual and that the individual's 
27 homestead is an eligible homestead, the municipality shall stabilize the property tax on the 
28 individual's homestead billed for the property tax year for which stabilization was 
29 requested.
304.  Transfer of eligibility.  If an eligible individual has been eligible for stabilization 
31 under this section and establishes a new homestead in the State, the individual continues to 
32 be eligible for stabilization.  If an eligible individual establishes a new homestead in a 
33 different municipality, at the request of the eligible individual, the municipality where 
34 eligibility was first established shall notify the new municipality of the eligible individual's 
35 previous eligibility and the amount at which the property taxes were stabilized.  The new 
36 municipality shall bill the eligible individual at the stabilized amount and is eligible for 
37 state compensation under subsection 5.
385.  State compensation.  A municipality that has stabilized property tax for an eligible 
39 individual under this chapter may recover from the State 100% of the amount by which the 
40 property tax assessed on the homestead of an eligible individual in the usual manner 
Page 2 - 130LR0346(01)41 exceeds the stabilized amount of property tax billed under subsection 3.  A municipality 
42 claiming compensation under this subsection shall submit a claim to the bureau by 
43 November 1st of the year in which the property tax was stabilized.  The bureau shall review 
44 claims and determine the total amount to be paid to each municipality.  The bureau shall 
45 certify and the Treasurer of State shall pay the amount due to each municipality by January 
46 15th of the year following the year in which the claim for compensation was submitted.
7SUMMARY
8 This bill requires a municipality to maintain the property tax on the homestead of a 
9 permanent resident who is at least 65 years of age at the amount billed in the year prior to 
10 an application for stabilization.  The amount by which the property tax assessed exceeds 
11 the stabilized amount must be paid to the municipality by the State.  If an eligible individual 
12 moves to a different municipality, the stabilized property tax amount continues at the new 
13 location.  An applicant for stabilization must be a permanent resident of the State and must 
14 have owned a homestead for at least 10 years.  An application for stabilization must be 
15 made each year to continue eligibility.1
