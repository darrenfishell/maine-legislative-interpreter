21 1.  It provides a refundable tax credit of $1,000 to $2,000 per eligible child to child 
22 care providers that provide services to children whose parents are participating in the child 
23 care subsidy program operated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office 
24 of Child and Family Services or foster children in the custody of the Department of Health 
25 and Human Services.  The amount of the credit is based on the quality of the child care 
26 provider as determined pursuant to a quality rating and improvement system based on 
27 standards for center-based child care programs developed by the Department of Health and 
28 Human Services, Office of Child and Family Services.
29 2.  It provides a refundable tax credit of $1,000 to $5,000 to administrators, educators 
30 and other professional support staff of child care providers that provide services to children 
31 whose parents are participating in the child care subsidy program operated by the 
32 Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child and Family Services or foster 
33 children in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services.  The amount of 
34 the credit is based on individual qualification score lattices developed and established for 
35 administrators, management, owners and coordinators and educators and other support 
36 staff of child care facilities through a collaborative partnership between the Cutler Institute 
37 of Health and Social Policy at the University of Southern Maine, the University of Maine 
38 Center for Community Inclusion and Disability Studies and the Department of Psychology 
39 at the University of Maine.
40 3.  It amends the current income tax credit for child care expenses to allow a taxpayer 
41 to obtain a credit of between 50% and 200% of the federal tax credit, depending on the 
42 quality rating of the child care site providing child care services for the child of the 
43 taxpayer.  Current law allows up to 50% of the federal tax credit if the child care expenses 
44 are incurred through the use of quality child care services.20
Page 7 - 130LR0718(01)1 4.  It provides a tax credit of a percentage of expenses paid by an employer to provide 
2 child care and education services to the children of its employees, either on site, at a facility 
3 licensed or registered with the Department of Health and Human Services or through child 
4 care resource and referral services or vouchers for the purpose of paying for child care and 
5 education services.  The percentage of expenses that may be taken by the employer is 
6 determined by the quality rating of the child care facility.
7 5.  It indexes for inflation the dollar amounts of the tax credits beginning annually in 
8 2023.
9 6.  It requires the Office of Child and Family Services to notify the State Tax Assessor 
10 immediately of any changes to the grading and scoring systems used to determine child 
11 care-related tax credits and requires the office, after consultation with the assessor, to 
12 submit a report and suggested legislation to implement the changes to the grading and 
13 scoring systems.
14 7.  It requires the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, 
15 beginning in 2025, to review the tax credits provided by this legislation to determine 
16 whether the specific public policy objectives and economic benefit of the credits outweigh 
17 the loss of revenue to the State and annually report its findings to the joint standing 
18 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation matters.
