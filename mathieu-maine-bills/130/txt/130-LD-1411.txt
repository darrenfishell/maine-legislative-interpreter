12SUMMARY
13 This bill establishes the Maine Buy American and Build Maine Act and requires that 
14 all contracts for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, improvement or 
15 maintenance of a public building or public work made by a state agency, board, commission 
16 or institution, except for the Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike 
17 Authority, contain a provision that any manufactured good valued over $500, including 
18 iron, cement and steel, and any article, material or supply acquired for public use used or 
19 supplied in the performance of the contract or any subcontract to the contract must be 
20 manufactured in the United States.  This requirement does not apply to counties, 
21 municipalities or school administrative units.
22 The bill requires, in the case of a manufactured good valued over $500, other than an 
23 iron, cement or steel product, all of the manufacturing processes to take place in the United 
24 States, the origin of the manufactured good's components to meet a minimum level of 
25 domestic content as established by rule or the manufactured good to be assembled in the 
26 United States.
27 Under the Act, a public agency may apply to the Governor or the Governor's designee 
28 for a waiver of the requirement if the executive head of the public agency finds that the 
29 application of the requirement would be inconsistent with the public interest, that the 
30 necessary manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and 
31 reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality, that inclusion of manufactured 
32 goods made in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project contract by an 
33 unreasonable amount or that the total cost of the contract is below a minimum project cost 
34 established by rule.  The Department of Administrative and Financial Services is directed 
35 to adopt rules to implement the Act.
36 The bill requires that, if the department has reason to believe that any person, business 
37 or other entity has intentionally made fraudulent representations about the domestic content 
38 of a manufactured good or has intentionally violated any provision of the Act, the 
39 department must, after a hearing, debar that person, business or other entity from contracts 
40 or subcontracts with the State for 2 years.
41 The bill provides that the provisions of this legislation must be applied in a manner 
42 consistent with the State's obligations under any applicable international agreements 1

4 alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of a public building or public work, for 
5 services to be provided to or on behalf of the State or for the purchase of manufactured 
6 goods, if 2 or more bids are submitted that are substantially similar, preference must be 
7 given to the bid submitted by an in-state contractor, which includes a business at which at 
8 least 60% of the employees are residents of Maine.  If the bid submitted by an in-state 
9 contractor is higher than the lowest bid submitted by a contractor that is not an in-state 
10 contractor, the in-state contractor must be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid 
11 submitted.  The preference provisions do not apply to the extent they violate or are 
12 inconsistent with federal funding requirements.
13 An in-state contractor may request that the Attorney General investigate the bidding 
14 and award process and act as a mediator between the in-state contractor and the public 
15 agency.1
