Page 2 - 130LR0754(01)1Sec. 8.  17-A MRSA §1809, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is 
2 amended to read:
31.  Authority of probation officer.   If a probation officer has probable cause to believe 
4 that a person on probation has violated a condition of that person's probation, that officer 
5 may arrest the person or cause the person to be arrested for the alleged violation, except 
6 that this subsection does not apply to a violation of a condition of probation that is solely a 
7 violation of a condition imposed pursuant to section 1807, subsection 2, paragraph I.  If the 
8 probation officer cannot, with due diligence, locate the person, the officer shall file a 
9 written notice of this fact with the court that placed the person on probation.  Upon the 
10 filing of that written notice, the court shall issue a warrant for the arrest of that person.
11Sec. 9.  17-A MRSA §1812, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is 
12 amended to read:
134.  Failure to comply with requirement of probation.   If the alleged violation does 
14 not constitute a crime and the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person 
15 on probation has inexcusably failed to comply with a requirement imposed as a condition 
16 of probation, it may revoke probation, except that this subsection does not apply to a 
17 violation of a condition of probation imposed pursuant to section 1807, subsection 2, 
18 paragraph I.
19Sec. 10.  17-A MRSA §1812, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is 
20 amended to read:
216.  Authority of court finding violation of probation.   Upon a finding of a violation 
22 of probation, the court may vacate all, part or none of the suspension of execution as to 
23 imprisonment or fine specified when probation was granted, considering the nature of the 
24 violation and the reasons for granting probation. The remaining portion of the sentence for 
25 which suspension of execution is not vacated upon the revocation of probation remains 
26 suspended and is subject to revocation at a later date. During the service of that portion of 
27 the sentence imposed for which the suspension of execution was vacated upon revocation, 
28 the running of the period of probation must be interrupted and resumes again upon release.  
29 If the court finds a violation of probation but vacates none of the suspended sentence, the 
30 running of the period of probation resumes upon entry of that final disposition.  The court 
31 may nevertheless revoke probation and vacate the suspension of execution as to the 
32 remainder of the suspended sentence or a portion thereof for any criminal conduct 
33 committed during the service of that portion of the sentence for which the suspension of 
34 execution was vacated upon revocation.  This subsection does not apply to a violation of a 
35 condition of probation imposed pursuant to section 1807, subsection 2, paragraph I if there 
36 is no alleged violation that constitutes a crime.
37Sec. 11.  17-A MRSA §1814, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is amended 
38 to read:
39§1814.  Additional conditions in lieu of probation revocation proceedings
40 Whenever a probation officer has probable cause to believe that a person under the 
41 supervision of that probation officer has violated a condition of probation but the violation 
42 does not constitute a crime, the probation officer, instead of commencing a probation 
43 revocation proceeding under section 1809, may offer to the person the option of adding one 
44 or more of the following conditions to the person's probation:
Page 3 - 130LR0754(01)11.  Participation in public restitution program or treatment program.   The person 
2 will participate in a public restitution program or treatment program administered through 
3 a correctional facility or county jail; or
42.  Residence at correctional facility or county jail.   The person will reside at a 
5 correctional facility or county jail for a period of time not to exceed 90 days.
63.  Sanctions; referral.  If the condition of probation that the probation officer has 
7 probable cause to believe was violated is a condition imposed pursuant to section 1807, 
8 subsection 2, paragraph I:
9 A.  The person may be required to comply with an additional sanction, but that sanction 
10 may not consist of incarceration; or
11 B.  The person may be referred to a certified recovery coach, a certified intentional 
12 peer support specialist or a qualified recovery support service if participating in 
13 recovery work is determined by the probation officer to be likely to be appropriate and 
14 of positive value to the person.
15 If the person agrees in writing to the additional conditions under subsection 1 or 2  
16 subsection 3, paragraph A, the conditions must be implemented.  If the person does not 
17 agree or if the person fails to fulfill the additional conditions to the satisfaction of the 
18 probation officer, the probation officer may commence probation revocation proceedings 
19 under section 1809 or 1810 for the violation that the probation officer had probable cause 
20 to believe occurred.  If the person fulfills the additional conditions to the satisfaction of the 
21 probation officer, the probation officer shall so notify the person in writing and the 
22 probation officer may not commence probation revocation proceedings for the violation 
23 that the probation officer had probable cause to believe occurred.
24SUMMARY
25 This bill provides definitions in the Maine Criminal Code chapter regarding probation 
26 for the terms "certified intentional peer support specialist," "certified recovery coach," 
27 "integrated medication-assisted treatment," "person with substance use disorder," 
28 "recovery," "recovery residence" and "recovery support services."  If a person on probation 
29 is subject to conditions requiring the person to refrain from drug use and excessive use of 
30 alcohol and the probation officer has cause to suspect a violation of those conditions, but 
31 not a violation of law that constitutes a crime, the bill prohibits arrest and revocation of 
32 probation for the violation of probation conditions.  If a person on probation is subject to 
33 conditions requiring the person to refrain from drug use and excessive use of alcohol and 
34 the probation officer has cause to suspect a violation of those conditions, but not a violation 
35 of law that constitutes a crime, the bill authorizes the probation officer to impose additional 
36 conditions in lieu of probation revocation, including referral to a certified recovery coach, 
37 a certified intentional peer support specialist or a qualified recovery support service, allows 
38 participation in a public restitution program or treatment program regardless of whether the 
39 program is administered through a correctional facility or county jail and prohibits the use 
40 of incarceration.25
