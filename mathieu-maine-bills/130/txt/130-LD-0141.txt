8 Revenue Services to disclose information to the Finance Authority of Maine necessary for 
9 the administration of the seed capital investment tax credit in the Maine Revised Statutes, 
10 Title 36, section 5216-B.  The authority is responsible for certifying investments that are 
11 eligible for the credit;
12 2.  Amends Title 36, section 5164, subsection 2, a provision of the Maine fiduciary 
13 income tax law, to incorporate gender-neutral terms, delete a duplicate word and make

21 for family and medical leave, "employees based in the State" means employees that 
22 perform more than 50% of employee-related activities for the employer at a location in

24 6.  Clarifies that a nonresident estate or trust that does not have Maine taxable income 
25 or a Maine income tax liability must nonetheless file a Maine income tax return if the estate 
26 or trust has distributable net income derived from or connected with sources in Maine and 
27 gross income of $10,000 or more.  This change reflects long-standing administrative 
28 practice; and
29 7.  Amends Title 36, sections 5221 and 5228 to incorporate gender-neutral terms.
30 For changes to the sales tax law, Part B:
31 1.  Amends the diabetic supplies exemption to require use by the purchaser;

33 Regular Session of the 129th Legislature that did not take effect until after the adjournment 
34 of the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature and repeals conflicting public law 
35 provisions;
36 3.   Clarifies the exemption for nonprofit worldwide charitable organizations; and
37 4. Removes the Mayo Regional Hospital in Dover-Foxcroft from the hospital tax 
38 definition of "municipally funded hospital."

2
Page 6 - 130LR0111(01)1 1.  Clarifies that the local assessor qualifying examination and individual examination 
2 results are confidential and thus not producible under a Freedom of Access Act request; 
3 and
4 2.  Clarifies that enhanced business equipment tax exemption reimbursement only 
5 applies to tax increment financing exempt business equipment when the reimbursement is 
6 used to fund a tax increment financing development program.

8 1.  Updates Title 36, section 173, concerning collection by warrant, to clarify the intent 
9 and make technical changes; and
10 2.  Repeals a provision that required the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
11 having jurisdiction over taxation matters to report out a bill permanently eliminating 
12 corporate tax expenditures totaling $6,000,000 per biennium by February 6, 2016.
