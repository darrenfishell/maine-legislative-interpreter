Page 1 - 130LR0589(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, in order to ensure the safety of the scallop fleet, this legislation needs to 
4 take effect immediately; and
5Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
6 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
7 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
8 therefore,
9Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
10Sec. 1.  12 MRSA ยง6171-A, sub-ยง6 is enacted to read:
116.  Scallop fishing; weather closures.  In accordance with this subsection, the 
12 commissioner may adopt rules providing for hazardous weather closures of the scallop 
13 season established under section 6722.  For purposes of this subsection, "hazardous 
14 weather" includes weather for which the National Weather Service has issued a warning of 
15 a gale, storm or hurricane.
16 A.  To the extent practicable, the commissioner may provide in any rules adopted under 
17 this subsection that a hazardous weather closure may be specific to fishery zones and 
18 shall provide for appropriate extensions of the scallop season to compensate for any 
19 hazardous weather closures during that season.
20 B.  The commissioner shall ensure that any rules adopted under this subsection include 
21 a system to provide notice of a hazardous weather closure by appropriate direct means, 
22 including by telephone or other direct electronic communication, to persons holding 
23 scallop licenses.
24 C.  The commissioner may, pursuant to section 6371, suspend for the remainder of a 
25 scallop season the scallop license of any person found by the commissioner to have 
26 fished for scallops during a hazardous weather closure in violation of any rules adopted 
27 under this subsection.  In addition, the commissioner shall require any such person who 
28 causes any search and rescue activities by the State on the person's behalf to pay all 
29 costs directly related to the State's search and rescue activities.
30 Rules adopted under this subsection prior to January 1, 2022 are routine technical rules as 
31 defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.  Rules adopted under this subsection on or 
32 after January 1, 2022 are major substantive rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
33 subchapter 2-A.
34Sec. 2.  Review of rules.  The Commissioner of Marine Resources shall develop 
35 proposed rules providing for hazardous weather closures under the Maine Revised Statutes, 
36 Title 12, section 6171-A, subsection 6 before September 1, 2021.  By September 1, 2021, 
37 the commissioner shall present to all scallop license holders the proposed rules and 
38 determine whether a majority of those scallop license holders support adoption of those 
39 rules.  The commissioner shall proceed to adopt the proposed rules if the commissioner 
40 finds that a majority of the scallop license holders support adoption of the rules.  If the 
41 commissioner finds that a majority of the scallop license holders do not support adoption 
42 of the proposed rules, the commissioner may not adopt the rules and shall instead direct the 
43 Scallop Advisory Council established under Title 12, section 6729-B to develop by January 
Page 2 - 130LR0589(01)44 1, 2022 a recommendation for an alternative method of protecting the safety of scallop 
45 license holders during hazardous weather.  The commissioner shall present the alternative 
46 method recommended by the council to the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources 
47 no later than January 15, 2022.  The committee may report out a bill relating to the 
48 recommendations of the council to the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature.
6Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
7 takes effect when approved.
8SUMMARY
9 This bill directs the Commissioner of Marine Resources to develop by September 1, 
10 2021 certain rules governing hazardous weather closures of the scallop season.  By 
11 September 1, 2021, the commissioner shall present to all scallop license holders the 
12 proposed rules and determine whether a majority of those scallop license holders support 
13 adoption of the rules.  The commissioner shall adopt the proposed rules if the commissioner
