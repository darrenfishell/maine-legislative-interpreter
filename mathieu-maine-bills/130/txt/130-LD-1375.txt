186.  Clerk to keep list of absentee voters.  The clerk shall create and maintain, in the 
19 central voter registration system, an alphabetical list, by district, of the persons who 
20 requested or were furnished absentee ballots, including the persons who voted in the 
21 presence of the clerk under subsection 8 and , the persons whose ballots were issued to a 
22 3rd person under subsection 1 and the persons who requested to vote by absentee ballot by

24 required under this subsection for a period of 2 years as a public record.
25 A.  The list of absentee voters and absentee voter applicants must include each voter's 
26 name, residence address, voting district and party affiliation; the date and manner by 
27 which the ballot was requested, issued and received; and a notation of whether the 
28 application and the ballot were accepted or rejected.  The clerk must also indicate on 
29 the list when the absentee voter is a uniformed service voter, overseas voter or township 
30 voter.  By the time that all absentee ballots have been processed on election day, the

32 absentee voters to reflect all ballots that were received by the close of the polls on 
33 election day, including a notation of whether the ballots were accepted or rejected and

41 be printed on a separate page of the list.  The portion of the list of absentee voters and 
42 absentee voter applicants relating to Address Confidentiality Program participants 
43 must be kept under seal and excluded from public inspection.

3 registration system.  The clerk must sign and date each official printed copy of the list 
4 of absentee voters and absentee voter applicants that is created for public inspection, 
5 certifying that the list is a true and accurate list of absentee voters and absentee voter 
6 applicants for the applicable election.  No additional certification is required by the

12 E.  Within 5 business days after each election, the clerk shall update the central voter 
13 registration system to include the changes required by paragraph A.  The clerk also 
14 must update the central voter registration system to reflect any absentee ballots 
15 received after the polls have closed on election day by changing the rejection reason.  
16 When all updates have been made in the central voter registration system, the clerk 
17 shall certify this to the Secretary of State and make a final list of absentee ballots 
18 available for public inspection.
