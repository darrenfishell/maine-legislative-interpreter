2PART A
3Sec. A-1.  29-A MRSA §412 is enacted to read:
4§412.  Rental fleet registration
51.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
6 following terms have the following meanings.
7 A.  "Rental fleet" means a fleet containing more than 25 rental fleet vehicles.
8 B.  "Rental fleet vehicle" means a motor vehicle that is:
9 (1)  Owned by a person engaged in the business of renting motor vehicles;
10 (2)  Offered for rental without a hired driver under a rental agreement; and
11 (3)  Designated by the registered owner of the motor vehicle as a rental fleet vehicle 
12 at the time of registration.
132.  Program established.  A rental fleet registration program is established to provide 
14 a means of issuing certificates of registration for rental fleet vehicles.  The Secretary of 
15 State shall adopt rules to administer the rental fleet registration program.  Rules adopted 
16 under this subsection must provide for:
17 A.  An application form;
18 B.  The payment of fees;
19 C.  The addition of rental fleet vehicles to and the removal of rental fleet vehicles from 
20 a rental fleet; 
21 D.  The issuance of certificates of registration for rental fleet vehicles; and
22 E.  The revocation of a certificate of registration for noncompliance with this section.
233.  License plate.  The Secretary of State shall determine the design for a rental fleet 
24 license plate. The design must include distinctive colors and graphics. The design may 
25 indicate that the plate does not have an expiration date.  The design may not include an 
26 expiration date.
274.  Application.  The owner of a rental fleet may apply to the Secretary of State to 
28 register rental fleet vehicles under this section.  The application for registration under this 
29 section must be in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State and must include:
30 A.  For each rental fleet vehicle, the information required in section 401, subsection 2;
31 B.  The election of a common registration renewal month for the rental fleet; and
32 C.  For each rental fleet vehicle, the municipality to which the excise tax described in 
33 Title 36, section 1482 is to be paid.
345.  Fees.  A registration fee must accompany a registration application submitted under 
35 this section. The fee is in an amount equal to the applicable annual registration fee required 
36 by section 501 or 504, as applicable.  In addition to the annual registration fee, an annual 
37 $2.50 inspection exemption fee applies to a rental fleet vehicle exempt from inspection 
38 under section 1752-A.  A fee collected under this subsection must be credited to the General 
39 Highway Fund.
Page 2 - 130LR2393(01)16.  Approval.  The Secretary of State shall approve an application for the registration 
2 of rental fleet vehicles that conforms to the rules adopted pursuant to this section and is 
3 accompanied by the appropriate fee.  On approval of an application for the registration of 
4 rental fleet vehicles, the Secretary of State shall:
5 A.  Record the registration of each rental fleet vehicle described in the registration 
6 application;
7 B.  Assign the owner of the rental fleet a rental fleet number;
8 C.  Issue a certificate of registration that contains the name and address of the owner 
9 of the rental fleet, the rental fleet number assigned under paragraph B and the 
10 registration renewal month; and
11 D.  Issue a set of 2 rental fleet license plates for each registered rental fleet vehicle.
127.  Renewal; revocation.  The owner of a rental fleet shall renew the registration 
13 together with the payment of the applicable registration fees annually on or before the last 
14 day of the registration renewal month assigned to the rental fleet.  If an owner fails to renew 
15 the registration as provided by this subsection, the Secretary of State shall revoke the 
16 registration.
178.  Validity.  A certificate of registration and rental fleet license plates issued under 
18 this section are valid as long as the vehicle is maintained as part of the rental fleet and the 
19 owner renews the registration annually.  Display of the rental fleet license plates is prima 
20 facie evidence that a vehicle has been registered in accordance with this section.
219.  Transfer.  If an owner removes a rental fleet vehicle registered under this section 
22 from a rental fleet, the owner may transfer the registration, including the certificate of 
23 registration and the rental fleet license plates, to another rental fleet vehicle, which must be 
24 registered within the same registration year.  The fee for transferring a registration under 
25 this subsection is $8.  If the registration fee for the vehicle to which the registration is 
26 transferred is greater than the fee for the vehicle that was removed, the owner shall pay the 
27 difference when registering the vehicle to which the registration was transferred.  A 
28 registration transferred under this subsection is subject to reimbursement in the same 
29 manner as described in Title 36, section 2015, subsection 2.
3010.  Compliance with International Registration Plan.  Registration under this 
31 section has no effect on a motor vehicle owner's responsibilities under the International 
32 Registration Plan described in section 531.
3311.  Rules.  The Secretary of State shall adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules 
34 adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 
35 375, subchapter 2-A.
36Sec. A-2.  29-A MRSA §1752-A is enacted to read:
37§1752-A.  Temporary exemption
38 A rental fleet vehicle registered under section 412 is exempt from inspection until the 
39 last day of the registration renewal month of the 3rd year following the year the vehicle 
40 was manufactured, or until the date the vehicle is removed from the rental fleet, whichever 
41 is earlier.  After the exemption period has expired or the vehicle has been removed from 
42 the rental fleet, the vehicle is subject to inspection in accordance with section 1751.  
Page 3 - 130LR2393(01)43 Display of rental fleet license plates creates a presumption that the vehicle is exempt from 
44 inspection.

41 Part A of this bill establishes a registration program for rental fleet vehicles that 
42 includes:1

41
42
Page 4 - 130LR2393(01)1 1.  A common registration renewal month;
2 2.  A unique owner registration number;
3 3.  Required annual renewal;
4 4.  The issuance of certificates of registration;
5 5.  Distinctive license plates;
6 6.  A temporary exemption from inspection requirements; and
7 7.  The ability to transfer and remove rental fleet vehicles.
8 Part A also specifies that participation in the rental fleet vehicle registration program 
9 has no effect on the requirements of the International Registration Plan.
10 Part B of the bill addresses the treatment of vehicles owned by a rental car company 
11 for purposes of the sales and use tax.  Current law requires that a rental car company that 
12 purchases a truck pay sales tax on that truck but is not required to charge sales tax on the 
13 charge for renting the truck to a consumer.  Part B makes such a purchase exempt from the 
14 sales tax and makes the rental subject to the rate of a taxable service.  Part B also makes 
15 technical corrections to the tax law regarding trucks.
