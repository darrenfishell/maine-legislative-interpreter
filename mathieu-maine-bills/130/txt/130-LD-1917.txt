37 the income, unless withholding pursuant to the Code is based on other than a flat rate 
38 amount.  In that event, the State's withholding procedure should must estimate taxable

31.  Taxpayers to list property; inquiries.  Before making an assessment, the assessor 
4 or assessors, chief assessor of a primary assessing area or State Tax Assessor in the case of 
5 the unorganized territory may give  seasonable  timely notice in writing to all persons liable 
6 to taxation or qualifying for an exemption pursuant to subchapter 4‑C in the municipality, 
7 the primary assessing area or the unorganized territory subject to full or partial 
8 reimbursement by the State to furnish to the assessor or assessors, chief assessor or State 
9 Tax Assessor true and perfect lists of all the property the taxpayer possessed on the first 
10 day of April of the same year and may at the time of the notice or thereafter require the 
11 taxpayer to answer in writing all proper inquiries as to the nature, situation and value of the 
12 taxpayer's property liable to be taxed in the State or subject to an exemption  pursuant to 
13 subchapter 4‑C  subject to full or partial reimbursement by the State.  The list and answers 
14 are not conclusive upon the assessor or assessors, chief assessor or State Tax Assessor.
15 As may be reasonably necessary to ascertain the value of property according to the income 
16 approach to value pursuant to the requirements of section 208‑A or generally accepted 
17 assessing practices, these inquiries may seek information about income and expense, 
18 manufacturing or operational efficiencies, manufactured or generated sales price trends or 
19 other related information.
20 A taxpayer has 30 days from receipt of a request for a true and perfect list or of proper 
21 inquiries to respond to the request or inquiries.  Upon written request to the assessor or 
22 assessors, chief assessor of a primary assessing area or State Tax Assessor in the case of 
23 the unorganized territory, a taxpayer is entitled to a 30-day extension to respond to the 
24 request for a true and perfect list or proper inquiries, and the assessor may at any time grant 
25 additional extensions upon written request.  Information provided by the taxpayer in 
26 response to an inquiry that is proprietary information, and is clearly labeled by the taxpayer 
27 as proprietary and confidential information, is confidential and is not a public record for 
28 purposes of Title 1, chapter 13.
29 A notice to or inquiry of a taxpayer made under this section may be by mail directed to the 
30 last known address of the taxpayer or by any other method that provides reasonable notice 
31 to the taxpayer.
32 If notice is given by mail and the taxpayer does not furnish the list and answers to all proper 
33 inquiries, the taxpayer may not apply to the assessor or assessors, chief assessor of a 
34 primary assessing area or State Tax Assessor in the case of the unorganized territory for an 
35 abatement or appeal an application for abatement of those taxes unless the taxpayer 
36 furnishes the list and answers with the application and satisfies the assessing authority or 
37 authority to whom an appeal is made that the taxpayer was unable to furnish the list and 
38 answers in the time required.  The list and answers are not conclusive upon the assessor or 
39 assessors, chief assessor or State Tax Assessor.
40 If the assessor or assessors, chief assessor of a primary assessing area or State Tax Assessor 
41 in the case of the unorganized territory fails to give notice by mail, the taxpayer is not 
42 prohibited from applying for an abatement; however, upon demand, the taxpayer shall 
43 furnish the list and answer in writing all proper inquiries as to the nature, situation and 
44 value of the taxpayer's property liable to be taxed in the State. A taxpayer's refusal or 
Page 4 - 130LR2203(01)45 neglect to answer the inquiries bars an appeal, but the list and answers are not conclusive 
46 upon the assessor or assessors, chief assessor or State Tax Assessor.
3 The assessor or assessors, chief assessor of a primary assessing area or State Tax Assessor 
4 in the case of the unorganized territory may require the person furnishing the list and 
5 answers to all proper inquiries to subscribe under oath to the truth of the list and answers.

34 day of April for the 5 tax years, or any lesser number of tax years starting with the year 
35 in which the land was first classified, preceding the withdrawal had that land been 
36 assessed in each of those years at its just value on the date of withdrawal less all taxes 
37 paid on that land over the preceding 5 years, or any lesser number of tax years starting 
38 with the year in which the land was first classified, and increased by interest at the

2 the land on the date of withdrawal exceeds the 100% valuation of the land pursuant to 
3 this subchapter on the preceding April 1st by the following rates:
4 (1)  If the land was subject to valuation under this subchapter for 10 years or fewer 
5 prior to the date of withdrawal, the rate is 30%; and
6 (2)  If the land was subject to valuation under this subchapter for more than 10 
7 years prior to the date of withdrawal, the rate is 30% reduced by one percentage 
8 point for each full year beyond 10 years that the land was subject to valuation under 
9 this subchapter prior to the date of withdrawal, except that the minimum rate is 
10 20%.  
11 For purposes of this subsection, just value at the time of withdrawal is the assessed just 
12 value of comparable property in the municipality adjusted by the municipality's certified 
13 assessment ratio.
144.  Assessment and collection of penalties.  The owner shall pay the penalties for 
15 withdrawal upon withdrawal to the tax collector as additional property taxes. Penalties may 
16 be assessed and collected as supplemental assessments in accordance with section 713‑B.

206.  Relief from requirements.  Upon withdrawal, the land is relieved of the 
21 requirements of this subchapter immediately and is returned to taxation under subchapter 
22 2 beginning the April 1st following withdrawal.
237.  Reclassification under other current use program.  A penalty may not be 
24 assessed upon the withdrawal of land from taxation under this subchapter if the owner 
25 applies for classification of that land in another current use program prior to withdrawal 
26 and the application is accepted.  If a penalty is later assessed under section 581 or 1138, the 
27 period of time that the land was taxed as farmland or open space land under this subchapter 
28 is included for purposes of establishing the amount of the penalty.
298.  Report of penalty.  A municipality that receives a penalty for the withdrawal of 
30 land from taxation under this subchapter shall report to the State Tax Assessor the total 
31 amount received in that reporting year on the municipal valuation return form described in

34 has been classified under this subchapter for 5 full years or more may pay any penalty owed 
35 under this section in up to 5 equal annual installments with interest at the rate set by the 
36 municipality, which begins to accrue 60 days after the date of assessment. Notwithstanding 
37 section 943, for an owner paying a penalty under this subsection, the period during which 
38 the tax lien mortgage, including interest and costs, must be paid to avoid foreclosure and 
39 expiration of the right of redemption is 48 months from the date of the filing of the tax lien

6§1115.  Transfer of portion of parcel of land
7 Transfer of a portion of a parcel of farmland subject to taxation under this subchapter 
8 does not affect the taxation under this subchapter of the resulting parcels unless they do not 
9 meet the minimum acreage requirements of this subchapter.  Transfer of a portion of a 
10 parcel of open space land subject to taxation under this subchapter does not affect the 
11 taxation under this subchapter of the resulting parcels unless either or both of the parcels 
12 no longer provide a public benefit in one of the areas enumerated in section 1102, 
13 subsection 6.  Each resulting parcel must be taxed to the owners under this subchapter until 
14 it is withdrawn from taxation under this subchapter, in which case the penalties provided 
15 in section 1112  1112-C apply only to the owner of that parcel.  If the transfer of a portion 
16 of a parcel of farmland subject to taxation under this subchapter results in the creation of a 
17 parcel that is less than the minimum acreage required by this subchapter or if the transfer 
18 of a portion of a parcel of open space land subject to taxation under this subchapter results 
19 in the creation of a parcel that no longer provides a public benefit in one of the areas 
20 enumerated in section 1102, subsection 6, that parcel is deemed to have been withdrawn 
21 from taxation under this subchapter as a result of the transfer and is subject to the penalties 
22 provided in section 1112  1112-C.

26 The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Bureau of Revenue 
27 Services shall periodically review the level of participation in the farm and open space tax 
28 program, the taxes saved due to that participation, the fiscal impact, if any, on 
29 municipalities, including the impact of any penalties assessed under section 1112  1112-C 
30 and the effectiveness of the program in preserving farmland and open space.  The 
31 department and the bureau may report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
32 having jurisdiction over taxation matters on the status of the program.  The department and 
33 the bureau may identify problems that prevent realization of the purposes of this subchapter 
34 and potential solutions to remedy those problems.

4 showing the area withdrawn and the area remaining under this subchapter.
53.  Penalty.  If land is withdrawn from taxation under this subchapter, the assessor shall 
6 impose a penalty upon the owner or owners.  The penalty is the greater of:
7 A.  An amount equal to the taxes that would have been assessed on the land on the first 
8 day of April for the 5 tax years, or any lesser number of tax years starting with the year 
9 in which the property land was first classified, preceding  such  the withdrawal had such 
10 real estate that land been assessed in each of those years at its just value on the date of 
11 withdrawal less all taxes paid on that real estate land over the preceding 5 years, or any 
12 lesser number of tax years starting with the year in which the land was first classified, 
13 and increased by interest at the prevailing municipal rate from the date or dates on
