21 Air Quality, as prepared by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
22 Conditioning Engineers, Inc. or more stringent standards Maine Uniform Building and 
23 Energy Code ventilation standards to buildings occupied by state employees  during normal 
24 working hours.  These standards must be applied to buildings that are constructed or

26 State enters into new leases or renews leases following the date in this subsection.  For the

28 cost exceeds 50% of the buildings' value.
29 A.  The bureau, in cooperation with a labor-management committee established to look 
30 at this issue, shall develop a plan by which priorities are established for improving 
31 indoor air quality and ventilation standards in buildings occupied by state employees.  
32 This plan must include data gathering and analysis of air quality in a sample number 
33 of buildings by which reasonable projections and estimates concerning air quality can 
34 be established.  The bureau shall report its findings to the joint standing committee of 
35 the Legislature having jurisdiction over state and local government no later than 
36 January 16, 1989.  This report, at a minimum, must contain the following:
37 ( 1)  A description of the extent of the problem, if any, with respect to air quality 
38 and ventilation in buildings occupied by state employees;
39 ( 2)  Priorities of locations for which the improvement of air quality is necessary.  
40 These locations must be areas occupied by state employees during normal working 
41 hours;
42 ( 3)  A timetable by which these priorities could be addressed;
Page 2 - 130LR2207(01)1 ( 4)  A description of what may be necessary to address these priorities, including 
2 feasible alternatives;
3 ( 5)  The costs of addressing these priorities; and
4 ( 6)  If possible, locations leased by the State that may not meet the air quality 
5 standards defined in this subsection.
6 Nothing in this paragraph may be construed to require the bureau to conduct an in depth 
7 analysis for each building or to present technical data for each building occupied by 
8 state employees.
9 B.  The indoor air quality and ventilation standards applied by the bureau remain in 
10 effect until the Board of Occupational Safety and Health adopts air quality and 
11 ventilation standards;
