Fiscal Note 
Removes Governor's facsimile signature from general obligation bonds 
Removing the requirement that general obligation bonds ratified by the legal voters of the State must bear the 
facsimile of the signature of the Governor does not, by itself, have a financial impact. To the extent that this leads tr ~ 
bond sale that is strongly opposed by a Governor, there may be unintentional tax and other consequences if that 
Governor blocks Executive Branch participation in pre-sale preparation of documents and the logistics of post-sale 
funding of projects.
