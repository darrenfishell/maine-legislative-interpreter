defines "bottle," when used as a verb in the State's liquor laws, to mean packaging spirits, 
wine or malt liquor for sale in containers. 
2. It states that the language of the amended definitions of "brewery" and "small 
brewery" may not be construed to affect the practice by which breweries and small 
breweries currently enter contracts with other breweries to produce a portion of their malt 
liquor products. In addition, it directs the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to study the issues of 
contract brewing and minimum in-state manufacturer production requirements, in 
consultation with representatives of a statewide association of breweries and small 
breweries and a statewide association of wholesale licensees of malt liquor, and to submit 
a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over alcoholic 
beverages matters on these topics by January 15, 2023. The committee may submit 
legislation related to the report to the 131 st Legislature in 2023. 
3. It clarifies within the definitions of "malt liquor" and "wine" that liquor that is 
produced by the fermentation of malt, substitutes for malt and other nonbeverage 
ingredients, including fruit concentrate, is considered malt liquor and not wine. It also adds 
a definition of "substitute for malt." 
4. It adds pickleball to the list of racquet sports offered at licensed indoor racquet 
centers. 
5. It moves the definition of "business entity," a phrase used in several provisions of 
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 28-A, from Title 28-A, section 707 to the general 
definitions section for the Title. 
6. The bill changes from a certificate of approval to a license the authority required by 
the operator of a special warehouse storage facility in the State. The amendment clarifies 
within other provisions of Title 28-A referencing the operators of such facilities that they 
are licensees and not certificate of approval holders. 
7. It changes the term "liquor enforcement officer" where used in Title 28-A to "liquor 
inspector," which is the current term for the position. 
8. It clarifies that the authority of the District Court to suspend or revoke the licenses 
of both a mobile service bar and of the underlying golf course, disc golf course, Class A 
restaurant, Class A restaurant/lounge or Class I hotel license and any other licenses held by 
the mobile service bar licensee for a violation occurring at the mobile service bar is an 
exception to the general rule that license suspensions apply only to the specific premises 
where a violation occurs. 
9. It clarifies that, to be eligible for a brewery, small brewery, winery or small winery 
license, a person must first hold a brewer's notice to produce malt liquor or hold a basic 
permit for producing wine from the United States Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. 
10. It clarifies that income from the sale of an in-state manufacturer's liquor for off­
premises consumption at its one location licensed pursuant to Title 28-A, chapter 43 is not 
included when calculating whether the manufacturer has satisfied any applicable income 
from the sale of food requirement that is a condition of the license for the one location 
licensed pursuant to Title 28-A, chapter 43.
