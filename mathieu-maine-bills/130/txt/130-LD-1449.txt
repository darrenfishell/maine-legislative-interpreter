2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to make changes to the school funding formula to create a more fair 
6 and equitable system of state funding for education by:
7 1.  Adding a per capita income adjustment to the school funding formula;
8 2.  Establishing a state per-pupil contribution rate equal to 46% of the cost of educating 
9 each student in each school administrative unit with additional funding provided to school 
10 administrative units with low property valuations and low per capita income;
11 3.  Providing additional funding outside of the school funding formula for service 
12 center communities to adjust for disparities created among communities by the school 
13 funding formula; or
14 4.  Adopting a version of one of the following models:
15 A.  The foundation grant model, in which the State determines a minimum amount that 
16 should be spent for each student, calculates the ability of a school administrative unit 
17 to pay for each student and provides funding for the difference to each school 
18 administrative unit;
19 B.  The guaranteed tax base model, in which the State guarantees that each municipality 
20 will raise a guaranteed amount of funding per student at a given rate of property 
21 taxation.  The State provides funding to a municipality for the difference between the 
22 guaranteed amount of funding and the amount actually raised;
23 C.  The centralized model, in which a standard property tax rate to fund the cost of 
24 education is set by the State and the State provides a standard per-pupil amount of 
25 funding to each school administrative unit; or
26 D.  The Vermont model, in which the State sets property tax rates and bills property 
27 owners to fund the cost of education with a lower rate for homesteads.  The State 
28 provides funding for education on a per-pupil basis with certain adjustments, including 
29 a poverty adjustment.  Local school districts may raise additional funds through 
30 property taxation to supplement funding provided by the State, subject to certain 
31 requirements and limits.
32 The bill also proposes, until such time as a more equitable change in the school funding 
33 formula takes place, that any money to fund education provided in addition to the money 
34 annually directed by the school funding formula, including COVID-19 relief funds, must 
35 be apportioned to each school administrative unit on a per-pupil basis.4
