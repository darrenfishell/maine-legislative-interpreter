12§5151.  Title
13 This chapter may be known and cited as "the Community Redevelopment Land Bank 
14 Act."
15§5152.  Findings and declaration of necessity
16 The Legislature finds and declares that:
171.  Blighted, abandoned, environmentally hazardous and functionally obsolete 
18property burdens public resources.  There exist areas in the State in need of economic 
19 revitalization where blighted, abandoned and environmentally hazardous property and 
20 property that is both functionally obsolete and unfit to be repurposed for another use present 
21 burdens on municipal revenues and public health and safety;
222.  Need for revitalization.  In order to strengthen and revitalize the economy of the 
23 State and municipalities, it is in the best interest of the State to assemble and dispose of 
24 blighted, abandoned and environmentally hazardous property and property that is both 
25 functionally obsolete and unfit to be repurposed for another use in a coordinated manner to 
26 foster development of that property and promote economic growth;
273.  Coordinated development of blighted, abandoned, environmentally hazardous 
28and functionally obsolete property serves the public interest.  The planning and 
29 preparation of revitalizing the economy through the acquisition of blighted, abandoned and 
30 environmentally hazardous property and property that is both functionally obsolete and 
31 unfit to be repurposed for another use using public money are a governmental concern and 
32 serve a valid public purpose; and
334.  Facilitate coordinated redevelopment of blighted, abandoned, environmentally 
34hazardous and functionally obsolete property.  The establishment of the redevelopment 
35 authority is necessary to facilitate the relief of the conditions described in this section by 
36 assisting local, state and federal agencies and private entities in the redevelopment of 4

Page 2 - 130LR1528(01)37 blighted, abandoned and environmentally hazardous property and property that is both 
38 functionally obsolete and unfit to be repurposed for another use into economically

40 described in this subchapter if they meet the other criteria described in this subchapter.
5§5153.  Community Redevelopment Land Bank Authority established; purpose
6 The Community Redevelopment Land Bank Authority, referred to in this chapter as

10 and clearance of title to, and acquisition of, property identified as blighted, abandoned, 
11 environmentally hazardous or functionally obsolete that has documented potential to be 
12 used and developed in a way that will promote economic growth within the municipality 
13 and the State.  The transfer of property to the redevelopment authority by a municipality 
14 may be facilitated through its legislative body or through a municipal development 
15 authority.
16§5154.  Appointment, qualifications and tenure
171.  Members appointed by the Governor.  The Governor shall appoint 9 members to

42 of one, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively, from the date of their appointment and the
