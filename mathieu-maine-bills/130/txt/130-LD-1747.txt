Page 1 - 130LR2144(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง1534 is enacted to read:
3ยง1534.  Cytomegalovirus public education and testing
41.  Required testing. If a newborn infant fails 2 hearing tests or has other risk factors 
5 for cytomegalovirus, a hospital, birthing center or other birthing service shall test the 
6 newborn infant, or cause the infant to be tested, for the presence of cytomegalovirus by 
7 means of a saliva or urine sample before hospital discharge or, if the infant was born outside 
8 a clinical setting, not later than the 21st day after the date of birth.
92.  Religious objection exemption.  The requirement under this section that a newborn 
10 infant must be tested for the presence of cytomegalovirus does not apply to a newborn 
11 infant if the parents of that infant object on the grounds that a test conflicts with their 
12 religious tenets and practices.
133.  Report.  A hospital, birthing center or other birthing service that tests or causes to 
14 be tested a newborn infant pursuant to this section shall report to the department aggregate 
15 data on the testing, including the number of infants born, the number tested for 
16 cytomegalovirus, the results of the screening and testing and the type of screening sample 
17 used.
184.  Public education.  The department shall provide public educational resources to 
19 pregnant women and women who may become pregnant that include information regarding 
20 the incidence of cytomegalovirus, the transmission of cytomegalovirus during and before 
21 pregnancy, birth defects caused by congenital cytomegalovirus, methods of diagnosing 
22 congenital cytomegalovirus, available preventive measures and resources for the family of 
23 an infant born with congenital cytomegalovirus.  The department may solicit and accept 
24 the assistance of relevant medical associations or community resources to develop, promote 
25 and distribute the public educational resources.
265.  Rulemaking.  The department may adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules 
27 adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 
28 375, subchapter 2-A.
29SUMMARY
30 This bill requires newborn infants who do not pass 2 hearing tests or who have other 
31 risk factors to be tested for cytomegalovirus. It also requires the Department of Health and 
32 Human Services to provide information to pregnant women and women who may become 
33 pregnant on the risks of cytomegalovirus.30
