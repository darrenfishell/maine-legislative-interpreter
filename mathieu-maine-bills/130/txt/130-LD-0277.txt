Page 1 - 130LR0290(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §6202, first ¶, as amended by PL 2015, c. 40, §4, is further 
3 amended to read:
4 The commissioner shall establish a statewide assessment program to measure and 
5 evaluate on a continuing basis the academic achievements of students in grades 3 to 12 on 
6 the accountability standards set forth in section 6209 and in department rules implementing 
7 that section and other curricular requirements.  The commissioner may elect to provide for 
8 the use of alternative measures of student achievement in grades 9 to 12.  This assessment 
9 applies to students in the public elementary and secondary schools, in public charter 
10 schools, as that term is defined in section 2401, subsection 9, and in all private schools 
11 approved for tuition whose school enrollments include at least 60% publicly funded 
12 students, as determined by the previous school year's October and April average 
13 enrollment.  The assessment program must be adapted to meet the needs of children with 
14 disabilities as defined in section 7001, subsection 1‑A or other students as defined under 
15 rules by the commissioner.  The assessment program may not include the use of the 
16 standardized test known as "the SAT" as a method for assessing student performance.
17Sec. 2.  Alternate method to the SAT.  By January 1, 2022, the Department of 
18 Education shall develop an alternate method of assessing student performance to replace 
19 the use of the standardized assessment test known as "the SAT."  The alternate method 
20 must meet all federal requirements.
21SUMMARY
22 This bill prohibits the Commissioner of Education from including the use of the SAT 
23 as a method for assessing student performance in the state assessment program.  It also 
24 directs the Department of Education to develop an alternate method to replace the SAT.
