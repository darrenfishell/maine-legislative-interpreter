Page 8 - 130LR0546(01)44 responsibility" may be determined by an evaluation of the total history concerning the

13 notice was mailed under this subsection, the director may issue a final decision denying the 
14 application for a license or for renewal of a license.  If the applicant or licensee makes a 
15 timely request for a hearing, the commissioner shall conduct an adjudicatory hearing in 
16 accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4.  The director's decision to deny the 
17 license or license renewal stands until the commissioner issues a decision to uphold, modify 
18 or overrule the director's decision.

4§1206.  Facility sports wagering license
51.  Issuance of license.  The director shall issue a facility sports wagering license upon 
6 finding that the applicant meets all requirements of this section, sections 1204 and 1205 
7 and rules adopted under this chapter.
82.  Eligibility.  To be eligible to receive a facility sports wagering license, an applicant 
9 must be:
10 A.  A commercial track licensed under section 271;
11 B.  An off-track betting facility licensed prior to January 1, 2021 under section 275-D 
12 or Public Law 2019, chapter 626, section 16;
13 C.  A slot machine facility or casino licensed under section 1011; or
14 D.  A federally recognized Indian tribe in this State.
15 Each entity or tribe identified in paragraphs A to D may receive only one facility sports 
16 wagering license under this section.
173.  Authority to conduct sports wagering; management services permitted.  A 
18 facility sports wagering license granted by the director pursuant to this section grants a 
19 licensee lawful authority to conduct sports wagering in which wagers are placed within a 
20 physical location controlled by the licensee in the State within the terms and conditions of 
21 the license and any rules adopted under this chapter.  A facility sports wagering licensee 
22 may contract with a management services licensee under section 1209.
234.  Fees.  The fee for an initial or renewed facility sports wagering license is $2,000 
24 and must be retained by the director for the costs of administering this chapter.  In addition 
25 to the license fee, the director may charge a processing fee for an initial or renewed license 
26 in an amount equal to the projected cost of processing the application and performing any 
27 background investigations.  If the actual cost exceeds the projected cost, an additional fee 
28 may be charged to meet the actual cost.  If the projected cost exceeds the actual cost, the 
29 difference may be refunded to the applicant or licensee.
305.  Term of license.  Except as provided in subsection 6, a license granted or renewed 
31 under this section is valid for 2 years unless sooner revoked by the director or the 
32 commissioner under section 1205.  The failure of an entity identified in subsection 2, 
33 paragraph A, B or C to maintain the underlying license described in that paragraph voids 
34 the entity's facility sports wagering license.
356.  Temporary license.  An applicant for a facility sports wagering license that is 
36 qualified under subsection 2, paragraph A, B or C may submit with the application a request 
37 for a temporary license.  An applicant for a facility sports wagering license that is qualified 
38 under subsection 2, paragraph D and that has a license to operate high-stakes beano under 
39 Title 17, section 314-A may submit with the application a request for a temporary license.
40 A request for a temporary license must include the initial license fee of $2,000.  If the 
41 director determines that the applicant is qualified under subsection 2, meets the 
42 requirements established by rule for a temporary license and has paid the initial license fee 
Page 10 - 130LR0546(01)43 and the director is not aware of any reason the applicant is ineligible for a license under 
44 this section, the director may issue a temporary facility sports wagering license.  A 
45 temporary license issued under this subsection is valid for one year or until a final
