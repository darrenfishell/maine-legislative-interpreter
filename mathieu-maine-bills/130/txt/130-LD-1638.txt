Page 8 - 130LR0201(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill reinstates the State's property tax deferral program, which was in effect for 
3 applications filed before April 1, 1991.  The bill modifies the program to include 
4 households with at least one individual who is 65 years of age or older or who is unable to 
5 continue employment due to disability and to surviving spouses who are unable to continue 
6 employment due to disability and provides that income must be less than $40,000.  The bill 
7 also changes the rate of accrual of interest on deferred property taxes from 6% to the prime 
8 rate published in the Wall Street Journal rounded up to the next whole percent minus one 
9 percentage point.  The bill adds a maximum liquid asset standard for eligibility of property 
10 owners and provides that property may not be subject to deferral under both the state 
11 deferral program and a municipal deferral program.  The bill also facilitates the 
12 administration of the deferral of property taxes for seniors and certain persons with 
13 disabilities, including expanding the authority of guardians to include an agent under a 
14 power of attorney or pursuant to a protective arrangement or any other lawful order.
15 The bill requires transfers from the Property Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents in 
16 case there are not sufficient funds to pay for the property tax deferral program; current law 
17 requires transfers from the General Fund.  In the event that there are not sufficient funds in 
18 the Property Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents, the bill requires that additional transfers 
19 be made from the Housing Opportunities for Maine Fund to cover the shortfall.  This bill 
20 requires repayment of those transfers, with interest, first to the Housing Opportunities for 
21 Maine Fund and then to the Property Tax Relief Fund when there are sufficient funds 
22 available for those reimbursements.2
