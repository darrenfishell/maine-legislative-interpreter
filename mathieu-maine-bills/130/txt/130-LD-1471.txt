5 that a responsible party makes such a prospective payment to the stewardship 
6 organization prior to initial program implementation, the stewardship organization 
7 shall reduce the fee owed by that responsible party during the first calendar year of 
8 program operation pursuant to this subsection by an amount equal to the amount of the 
9 prospective payment.
10 F. If a responsible party can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the stewardship 
11 organization that the packaging material associated with a covered product sold, 
12 offered for sale or distributed for sale in or into the State by the responsible party 
13 achieved an 80% or greater recycling rate in the State during the prior calendar year, 
14 the stewardship organization may reduce the fees owed by the responsible party under 
15 this subsection to an amount that represents no more than the costs associated with the 
16 transportation for recycling in the State of that packaging material.
17 G. Beginning during the 5th year of program implementation, unless an earlier date is 
18 agreed upon by the stewardship organization and the state stewardship plan committee 
19 established pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph A, subparagraph (3), the stewardship 
20 organization may propose for adoption as part of an updated plan submitted under 
21 subsection 3, paragraph D a schedule of fee adjustments for packaging material.  In 
22 developing such a schedule of fee adjustments, the stewardship organization shall 
23 consider as a basis for proposing favorable fee adjustments the following factors:
24 (1) Achievement of recyclability of packaging material that was previously not 
25 considered recyclable;
26 (2) Increased use of post-consumer recycled content in packaging material;
27 (3) Achievement by packaging material of the requirements of ISO 18602:2013, 
28 the methodologies and procedures for optimization of the packaging system 
29 published by the International Organization for Standardization, or successor 
30 publication;
31 (4) Demonstration of greenhouse gas emissions reductions relating to the use of a 
32 packaging material type associated with a covered product as compared to a 
33 previously used packaging material type or as compared to a packaging material 
34 type commonly used for similar products; or
35 (5) Achievement of significant reduction in food waste generation or product 
36 breakage relating to the use of a packaging material type associated with a covered 
37 product as compared to a previously used packaging material type or as compared 
38 to a packaging material type commonly used for similar products.
39 H. Nothing in this section prohibits a stewardship organization from establishing and 
40 requiring by private agreement or contract the payment of other fees associated with a 
41 covered product's supply chain by 3rd parties that are not responsible parties. 
425. Packaging stewardship fund. In accordance with the provisions of this subsection, 
43 a stewardship organization shall establish and manage a packaging stewardship fund. The 
44 stewardship organization shall deposit into the fund all payments received from responsible 
Page 10 - 130LR1269(01)45 parties pursuant to subsection 4 and shall distribute from the fund payments authorized 
46 pursuant to subsection 6.  
3 A. In addition to the distributions authorized pursuant to subsection 6, the stewardship 
4 organization may expend from the fund those payments necessary to cover the 
5 stewardship organization's reasonable operating expenses and administrative costs.
6 B. In establishing the fund under this subsection, the stewardship organization shall 
7 ensure that, in the event that the stewardship organization ceases to exist or the 
8 department withdraws its approval for the program that the stewardship organization 
9 had previously implemented, the funds within the fund remain within the fund until 
10 they can be transferred to a successor stewardship organization or the department 
11 approves the stewardship organization's continued operation of the program.
126. Payments to support operational recycling costs; recycling improvement 
13grants.  In accordance with the provisions of this subsection, a stewardship organization 
14 shall distribute from the fund payments to support the operational recycling costs of eligible 
15 entities and grants to improve recycling infrastructure in the State.
16 A. Based on the statewide recycling needs assessment under subsection 3, paragraph 
17 A, subparagraph (5) and considering the performance goals established pursuant to 
18 subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (8), the stewardship organization shall 
19 annually determine the amount of funds anticipated to be available within the fund 
20 under subsection 5 for distribution pursuant to this paragraph to offset certain 
21 operational recycling costs incurred by eligible entities.
22 (1) For the purposes of this paragraph, an eligible entity is a municipality, a refuse 
23 disposal district under chapter 17 or a regional association in the State that:
24 (a) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the stewardship organization that the 
25 entity has complied with or achieved measurable progress toward complying 
26 with the recycling and recovery best practice standards adopted pursuant to 
27 subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (6); 
28 (b) Reports to the stewardship organization in a manner prescribed by the 
29 organization the amount of packaging material it collected, processed and 
30 recycled or composted during the prior calendar year; and
31 (c) As directed by the stewardship organization, provides any other 
32 information necessary for the stewardship organization to calculate for that 
33 entity the distributions described in subparagraph (2). 
34 If a municipality, refuse disposal district or regional association contracts with a 
35 private entity for the collection, transportation, processing and recycling of 
36 packaging material, the stewardship organization shall consider the private entity 
37 to be an eligible entity under this subparagraph and, as appropriate, shall distribute 
38 the amounts calculated pursuant to subparagraph (2) to that private entity as long 
39 as the private entity meets the requirements of divisions (a) to (c).
40 (2) The stewardship organization shall annually distribute to each eligible entity 
41 the following amounts:
42 (a) A fixed amount for each ton or a per capita amount for packaging material 
43 recycled by the entity in the prior calendar year based upon the average costs 1
2
Page 11 - 130LR1269(01)44 associated with the transportation, from a central location within a 
45 municipality, of collected packaging material from the municipality to a 
46 recycling facility; the processing of and removal of contamination from 
47 packaging material by a recycling facility; and the recycling or composting of 
48 packaging material in the State or in another jurisdiction less the average fair 
49 market value in the State for that packaging material.  In determining costs 
50 under this division, the stewardship organization may not include costs 
51 associated with the landfill disposal of packaging material, except for costs 
52 associated with the landfill disposal of contaminated materials removed from 
53 collected packaging material; and 
11 (b) An additional fixed amount for each ton or a per capita amount for 
12 packaging material that is not considered recyclable pursuant to this section 
13 that are recycled, composted or otherwise diverted from landfill disposal by 
14 the entity in the prior calendar year less the average fair market value in the 
15 State for that packaging material.
16 B.  Based on the statewide recycling needs assessment described pursuant to subsection 
17 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (5) and considering the performance goals established 
18 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (8), the stewardship organization 
19 shall annually determine the amount of funds anticipated to be available within the 
20 fund under subsection 5 for distribution pursuant to this paragraph in the form of grants 
21 to eligible entities to support improvements in recycling infrastructure.
22 (1) For the purposes of this paragraph, an eligible entity is a municipality, a refuse 
23 disposal district under chapter 17, a regional association or a private entity in the 
24 State that:
25 (a) Submits a grant proposal to the stewardship organization designed to 
26 improve recycling infrastructure in the State;
27 (b) Describes in the grant proposal under division (a) how the grant will 
28 promote compliance with the recycling and recovery best practice standards 
29 adopted pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (6); and
30 (c) As directed by the stewardship organization, provides as part of the grant 
31 proposal under division (a) all other information necessary for the stewardship 
32 organization to evaluate the proposal.
33 (2)  Subject to the availability of funds as determined under this paragraph, after 
34 annually soliciting grant proposals under this paragraph from eligible entities and 
35 reviewing all such grant proposals received, the stewardship organization shall 
36 distribute grants to fund those proposals, or a portion of those proposals, based on 
37 the following order of priority:
38 (a) Proposals designed to support or improve end market development 
39 programs or infrastructure in the State;
40 (b) Proposals designed to support or improve recyclable material sorting or 
41 processing technology or infrastructure in the State;
42 (c) Proposals designed to support or improve advanced recycling technology 
43 or infrastructure in the State;1

Page 12 - 130LR1269(01)1 (d) Proposals designed to support or expand composting infrastructure in the 
2 State; and
3 (e) Proposals designed to increase consumer education in the State regarding 
4 accessing recycling infrastructure and reducing contamination in recycling.
5 C. In consultation with the state stewardship plan committee established pursuant to 
6 subsection 2, paragraph A, subparagraph (3), the stewardship organization shall adopt 
7 methods for the reporting or submission of the information required to obtain eligibility 
8 for the distributions under paragraph A or the grants under paragraph B that are not 
9 unduly burdensome on the entities that may be reporting or submitting that 
10 information.  As determined pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (7), 
11 if the stewardship organization has elected to provide technical assistance in complying 
12 with the requirements of this subsection to municipalities with fewer than 2,500 
13 residents, the stewardship organization shall establish procedures or programs to 
14 facilitate the provision of that technical assistance.
157.  Administration and enforcement; rulemaking; fees; report.  The department 
16 shall administer and enforce this section and may adopt rules as necessary to implement 
17 this section.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined 
18 in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. 
19 A.  At the time that a stewardship organization submits a plan to the department 
20 pursuant to subsection 3 to initially establish a stewardship program, and annually 
21 thereafter, the department shall require the stewardship organization to pay to the 
22 department a reasonable annual fee established by the department, not to exceed 
23 $300,000, to cover the department's actual costs for review of the plan and the costs in 
24 the prior fiscal year for the department's oversight, administration and enforcement of 
25 the program implemented by the stewardship organization pursuant to this section.  At 
26 the time that one or more responsible parties submit a proposal to the department 
27 pursuant to subsection 2 to establish a stewardship organization, the department shall 
28 require the payment of a reasonable one-time fee to cover the department's actual costs 
29 for review of the proposal.
30 B. Beginning February 15, 2025, and annually thereafter, the department shall submit 
31 a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
32 environment and natural resources matters regarding the packaging stewardship 
33 programs implemented pursuant to this section.  The report required under this 
34 paragraph may be included in the report required pursuant to section 1772, subsection 
35 1.
36 C. The department shall monitor actions at the federal level regarding the establishment 
37 of similar stewardship programs for covered products and shall include information 
38 regarding those actions in the report required under paragraph B.  If the department 
39 determines that legislation is enacted or programs are established at the federal level 
40 that achieve the goals of this section, the department shall recommend in the report 
41 required under paragraph B that this section be repealed or amended as necessary.
428. Antitrust exclusions. A responsible party or a stewardship organization, including 
43 a responsible party's or stewardship organization's officers, members, employees and 
44 agents that organize a packaging stewardship program under this section, is immune from 
45 liability for the responsible party's or stewardship organization's conduct under state laws 
Page 13 - 130LR1269(01)46 relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices and other regulation of trade or 
47 commerce only to the extent necessary to plan and implement the responsible party's or 
48 stewardship organization's packaging stewardship program consistent with the provisions 
49 of this section. 
59.  Preemption.  To ensure maximum effectiveness through uniform statewide 
6 application, beginning January 1, 2025, the State intends to occupy the whole field of 
7 regulation of stewardship programs for covered products and packaging material consistent 
8 with the provisions of this section. A local government may not adopt an ordinance 
9 establishing, requiring the establishment of or otherwise regulating stewardship programs 
10 for covered products and packaging material and, beginning January 15, 2025, any 
11 ordinance or regulation that violates this subsection is void and has no force or effect.
12SUMMARY
13 This bill facilitates the establishment of one or more stewardship programs in the State 
14 for packaging material to be operated by a stewardship organization approved by the 
15 Department of Environmental Protection.  Under such a program, the plan for which must 
16 be approved by the department and annually updated following a department review, 
17 participating responsible parties that sell, offer for sale or distribute for sale in or into the 
18 State certain products contained, protected, delivered, presented or distributed in or using 
19 packaging material are required to pay fees related to the packaging material associated 
20 with those products.  
21 Responsible party payments received by a stewardship organization are used to offset 
22 operational recycling costs incurred by entities meeting certain eligibility requirements, 
23 which may include municipalities, refuse disposal districts and regional waste management 
24 associations in the State.  Responsible party payments are also used to fund grants to entities 
25 meeting certain eligibility requirements, which may include municipalities, refuse disposal 
26 districts, regional waste management associations and private entities in the State, to 
27 support improvements in recycling infrastructure in the State.1
