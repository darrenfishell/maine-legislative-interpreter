32 prescription drug sold, dispensed or delivered to any consumer in this State.
332.  Determination of excessive price increases.  A price increase of a generic or off-

31 in violation of this section.
32Sec. 2.  Legislative findings; impact of price increases for prescription 
33drugs.  In order to protect the safety, health and economic well-being of the residents of 
34 this State by guarding them from the negative and harmful impact of excessive and 
35 unconscionable prices for prescription drugs, the enactment of this Act is necessary and the 
36 Legislature finds that:
37 1.  Access to prescription drugs is necessary for consumers in this State to maintain or 
38 acquire good health;
39 2.  Excessive and unconscionable prices negatively impact the ability of consumers in 
40 this State to obtain prescription drugs and excessive and unconscionable price increases 
41 thereby endanger the health and safety of consumers in this State to maintain or acquire 
42 good health;
Page 4 - 130LR1071(01)1 3.  Excessive and unconscionable prices for prescription drugs threaten the economic 
2 well-being of consumers in this State and endanger their ability to pay for other necessary 
3 and essential goods and services including housing, food and utilities;
4 4.  Excessive and unconscionable prices for prescription drugs contribute significantly 
5 to a dramatic and unsustainable rise in health care and health insurance costs that threatens 
6 the overall ability of consumers in this State to obtain health coverage and maintain or 
7 acquire good health; and 
8 5.  Excessive and unconscionable prices for prescription drugs contribute significantly 
9 to rising state costs for health care provided and paid for through:
10 A.  State-funded medical assistance programs for consumers in this State who are 
11 elderly, are living with disabilities or have low incomes; and
12 B.  Health insurance programs for public employees, including employees of the State, 
13 municipalities, counties, school districts and institutions of higher education, and for 
14 retirees whose health care costs are funded by public programs, thereby threatening the 
15 ability of the State to fund those programs adequately and further threatening the ability 
16 of the State to fund other programs necessary for the public good and safety, such as 
17 public education and public safety.
18SUMMARY
19 This bill prohibits excessive price increases for generic and off-patent prescription 
20 drugs sold in this State. The bill makes prescription drug manufacturers who violate the 
21 provisions subject to enforcement action by the Attorney General.19
