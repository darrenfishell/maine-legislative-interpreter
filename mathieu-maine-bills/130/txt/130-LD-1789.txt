2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, schools receiving tuition students who are enrolled in career and technical 
4 education programs are already experiencing undue financial burdens; and
5Whereas, in the absence of this legislation, schools receiving tuition students who are 
6 enrolled in career and technical education programs will be on the brink of financial 
7 hardship; and
8Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
11 therefore,
12Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

17 tuition rate approved pursuant to section 5805, subsection 1 for the receiving school for 
18 nonresident students enrolled in secondary schools or special education or career and 
19 technical education programs as long as the student maintains a satisfactory standard of 
20 deportment and scholarship.  The commissioner shall pay tuition for each tuition student 
21 in an amount equal to the official tuition rate approved pursuant to section 7302 for the 
22 receiving school for nonresident students enrolled in special education programs, as long 
23 as the student maintains a satisfactory standard of deportment and scholarship.
24Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §5809, as amended by PL 2017, c. 420, §1, is repealed.

29 contribute toward the costs of the center serving the school, on a pro rata share based on

Page 2 - 130LR2357(01)1SUMMARY
2 Under current law, a school that receives publicly funded tuition students who are 
3 enrolled in regular school day career and technical education programs at career and 
4 technical education centers, satellites or regions may charge a tuition rate of only up to 2/3 
5 of the maximum tuition rate.  This bill removes this limitation on schools approved for 
6 tuition purposes. This bill then directs each school approved for tuition purposes to enter 
7 into an agreement for the purpose of determining that school's per-pupil contribution 
8 toward the costs of the career and technical education center or region serving that school.2
