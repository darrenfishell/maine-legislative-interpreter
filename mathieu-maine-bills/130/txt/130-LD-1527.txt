10 requirements established by rule for a temporary license and has paid the initial license fee 
11 and the director is not aware of any reason the applicant is ineligible for a license under

13 temporary license issued under this subsection is valid for one year or until a final 
14 determination on the facility sports wagering license application is made, whichever is 
15 sooner.  If after investigation the director determines that the applicant is eligible for a 
16 facility sports wagering license under this chapter, the director shall issue the initial facility 
17 sports wagering license, at which time the temporary license terminates.  The initial facility 
18 sports wagering license is valid for 2 years from the date that the temporary license was

81.  Adoption of house rules.  An operator shall adopt comprehensive house rules for 
9 game play governing sports wagering transactions with its patrons.  House rules must be 
10 approved by the director prior to implementation and meet the minimum standards

12 rules specify the amounts to be paid on winning wagers and the effect of schedule changes, 
13 the circumstances under which the operator will void a bet and treatment of errors, late bets 
14 and related contingencies.
152.  Advertisement of house rules.  The house rules, together with any other

31 relative living in the same household as any of these persons.  This subsection does not

33 operator or management services licensee from making a sports wager with an unaffiliated 
34 operator or management services licensee;
354.  Interested parties.  A person with an interest in the outcome of the sports event

8§1214.  Certain sports wagers prohibited 
91.  Prohibited wagers.  An operator may not, with respect to a sports event of a sport 
10 governing body headquartered in the United States, offer or accept wagers on the 
11 occurrence of injuries or penalties, the outcome of player disciplinary rulings or replay 
12 reviews.
132.  Request from sports governing body.  A sports governing body may submit to the 
14 director in writing a request to restrict, limit or exclude a certain type, form or category of 
15 sports wagering with respect to sports events of that sports governing body if the sports 
16 governing body believes that that type, form or category of sports wagering with respect to 
17 sports events of that sports governing body may undermine the integrity or perceived 
18 integrity of that sports governing body or sports events of that sports governing body.  The 
19 director shall request comment from operators on all requests under this subsection.  After 
20 giving due consideration to all comments received, the director shall, upon a demonstration 
21 of good cause from the sports governing body that the type, form or category of sports 
22 wagering is likely to undermine the integrity or perceived integrity of that sports governing 
23 body or sports events of that sports governing body, grant the request.  The director shall 
24 respond to a request concerning a particular event before the start of the event or, if it is not 
25 feasible to respond before the start of the event, no later than 7 days after the request is 
26 made.  If the director determines that the sports governing body is more likely than not to 
27 prevail in successfully demonstrating good cause for its request, the director may 
28 provisionally grant the request of the sports governing body until the director makes a final 
29 determination as to whether the sports governing body has demonstrated good cause.  
30 Absent such a provisional grant by the director, an operator may continue to offer sports 
31 wagering on sports events that are the subject of that request during the pendency of the 
32 director's consideration of the request. 
33§1215.  Abnormal wagering activity
341.  Duty to report.  An operator shall, as soon as practicable, report to the director any 
35 information relating to abnormal wagering activity or patterns that may indicate a concern 
36 with the integrity of a sports event or any other conduct that corrupts a wagering outcome 
37 of a sports event for purposes of financial gain, including match fixing.  An operator shall 
38 concurrently report that information to the relevant sports governing body. 
392.  Cooperation efforts.  An operator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to 
40 cooperate with investigations conducted by sports governing bodies or law enforcement 
41 agencies, including but not limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to provide or 
42 facilitate the provision of wagering information. 
433.  Information confidentiality.  The director and operators shall maintain the 
44 confidentiality of information provided by a sports governing body for purposes of 
Page 16 - 130LR1296(01)45 investigating or preventing the conduct described in this section, unless disclosure is 
46 otherwise required by the director or by law, or unless the sports governing body consents 
47 to disclosure. 
44.  Information use and disclosure.  With respect to any information provided by an 
5 operator to a sports governing body relating to conduct described in this section, a sports 
6 governing body: 
7 A.  May use such information only for integrity purposes and may not use the 
8 information for any commercial or other purpose; and
9 B.  Shall maintain the confidentiality of the information, unless disclosure is otherwise 
10 required by the director or by law, or unless the operator consents to disclosure, except 
11 that the sports governing body may make disclosures necessary to conduct and resolve 
12 integrity-related investigations and may publicly disclose such information if required 
13 by the sports governing body's integrity policies or if determined by the sports 
14 governing body in its reasonable judgment to be necessary to maintain the actual or 
15 perceived integrity of its sports events.  Prior to any public disclosure that would 
16 identify the operator by name, the sports governing body shall provide that operator 
17 with notice of the disclosure and an opportunity to object to the disclosure. 
18§1216.  Official league data
191.  Results determination.  An operator is not required to use official league data for 
20 determining the results of tier 1 sports wagers on events of any organization headquartered 
21 in the United States or elsewhere or the results of tier 2 sports wagers on events of 
22 organizations that are not headquartered in the United States. 
232.  Use of official league data notification.  A sports governing body may notify the 
24 director that it desires operators to use official league data to settle tier 2 sports wagers on 
25 sports events of that sports governing body. The notification must be made in the form and 
26 manner as the director requires. The director shall notify each operator of a sports 
27 governing body's notification within 5 days of the director's receipt of the notification. If a 
28 sports governing body does not so notify the director, an operator is not required to use 
29 official league data for determining the results of tier 2 sports wagers on sports events of 
30 that sports governing body.
313.  Use of official league data required; exemptions.  Within 60 days of the director's 
32 notifying each operator of a sports governing body notification to the director under 
33 subsection 2, or such longer period as may be agreed to between the sports governing body 
34 and the applicable operator, an operator must use only official league data to determine the 
35 results of tier 2 sports wagers on sports events of that sports governing body, unless:
36 A.  The sports governing body or its designee cannot provide a feed of official league 
37 data to determine the results of a particular type of tier 2 sports wager, in which case 
38 operators are not required to use official league data for determining the results of the 
39 applicable tier 2 sports wager until such time as a data feed becomes available from the 
40 sports governing body on commercially reasonable terms and conditions; 
41 B.  The operator can demonstrate to the director that the sports governing body or its 
42 designee will not provide a feed of official league data to the operator on commercially 
43 reasonable terms and conditions; or1
2
3
Page 17 - 130LR1296(01)1 C.  The sports governing body or its designee does not obtain a license from the director 
2 to provide official league data to operators to determine the results of tier 2 sports 
3 wagers, if and to the extent required by law.
44.  Commercially reasonable terms.  The director may consider the following 
5 nonexclusive factors in evaluating whether official league data is being offered on 
6 commercially reasonable terms and conditions for purposes of subsection 3:
7 A.  The extent to which operators have purchased the same or similar official league 
8 data on the same or similar terms, particularly in jurisdictions where that purchase was 
9 not required by law or was required by law but only if offered on commercially 
10 reasonable terms;
11 B.  The nature and quantity of the official league data, including but not limited to its 
12 speed, accuracy, reliability and overall quality as compared to comparable nonofficial 
13 data;
14 C.  The quality and complexity of the process used to collect and distribute the official 
15 league data as compared to comparable nonofficial data;
16 D.  The availability of a sports governing body's tier 2 official league data to an operator 
17 from more than one authorized source;
18 E.  Market information, including but not limited to price and other terms and 
19 conditions, regarding the purchase by operators of comparable data for the purpose of 
20 settling sports wagers in this State and other jurisdictions; and
21 F.  The extent to which sports governing bodies or their designees have made data used 
22 to settle tier 2 sports wagers available to operators and any terms and conditions 
23 relating to the use of that data.
245.  Pendency.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, during the 
25 pendency of the director's determination as to whether a sports governing body or its 
26 designee will provide a feed of official league data on commercially reasonable terms, an 
27 operator is not required to use official league data for determining the results of tier 2 sports 
28 wagers.  The director's determination must be made within 60 days of the operator's 
29 notifying the director that it desires to demonstrate that the sports governing body or its 
30 designee will not provide a feed of official league data to the operator on commercially 
31 reasonable terms.
326.  Sharing agreements.  A sports governing body on whose sports events the director 
33 has authorized wagering may also enter into commercial agreements with operators or 
34 other entities in which that sports governing body may share in the amount wagered from 
35 sports wagering on sports events of that sports governing body.  A sports governing body 
36 is not required to obtain a license or other approval from the director to lawfully accept 
37 such amounts.  
387.  Information disclosure.  All disclosures of information under this chapter are 
39 subject to compliance with all federal and state laws and rules, including without limitation 
40 laws and rules relating to privacy and personally identifiable information. 
41§1217.  Security, maintenance and sharing of wagering records
421.  Records maintenance.  An operator shall maintain records of all wagers placed, 
43 including personally identifiable information of the bettor, amount and type of wager, time 
Page 18 - 130LR1296(01)44 the wager was placed, location of the wager, including the Internet protocol address if 
45 applicable, the outcome of the wager and instances of abnormal wagering activity for 3 
46 years after the sports event occurs, as well as video recordings in the case of in-person 
47 wagers for at least one year after the sports event occurs and shall make that data available 
48 for inspection upon request of the director or as required by court order.  
62.  Anonymized information.  An operator shall use commercially reasonable efforts 
7 to maintain, in real time and at the account level, anonymized information regarding a 
8 bettor and the amount and type of a wager, the time the wager was placed, the location of 
9 the wager, including the Internet protocol address if applicable, the outcome of the wager 
10 and records of abnormal wagering activity.  The director may request that information in 
11 the form and manner required by rule.  Nothing in this subsection requires an operator to 
12 provide any information that is prohibited by federal or state law, including without 
13 limitation laws and rules relating to privacy and personally identifiable information.  
143.  Records monitoring.  If a sports governing body has notified the director that 
15 access to the information described in subsection 2 for wagers placed on sports events of 
16 that sports governing body is necessary to monitor the integrity of that sports governing 
17 body's sports events, and the sports governing body represents to the director that it 
18 specifically uses that data for the purpose of monitoring the integrity of sports events of 
19 that sports governing body, then an operator shall share, in a commercially reasonable 
20 frequency, form and manner, with the sports governing body or its designee the same 
21 information the operator is required to maintain under subsection 2 with respect to sports 
22 wagers on sports events of that sports governing body.  A sports governing body and its 
23 designee may use information received under this subsection only for integrity-monitoring 
24 purposes and may not use information received under this subsection for any commercial 
25 or other purpose.  Nothing in this subsection requires an operator to provide any 
26 information if prohibited by federal or state law, including without limitation laws and rules 
27 relating to privacy and personally identifiable information.  
284.  Security.  An operator shall use commercially reasonable methods to maintain the 
29 security of wagering data, customer data and other confidential information from 
30 unauthorized access and dissemination.  Nothing in this chapter precludes the use of 
31 Internet-based or so-called cloud-based hosting of that data and information or disclosure 
32 as required by law.
