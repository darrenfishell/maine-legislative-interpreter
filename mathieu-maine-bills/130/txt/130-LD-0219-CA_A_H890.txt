This bill changes the funding structure and eligibility criteria for grants made through the Agricultural Development 
Fund administered by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF). It also changes the eligibility 
criteria, loan limits, and interest rates on loans made from the Agricultural Marketing Loan Fund within the Finance 
Authority of Maine (FAME) but a&ninistered by ACF. 
This bill requires the State Controller to make annual transfers of $550,000 from General Fund undedicated revenue to 
the Agricultural Development Fund within ACF and includes ongoing allocations to ACF of that amount beginning in 
fiscal year 2022-23 to allow expenditure of the funds. The bill also directs FAME to transfer the balance of interest in 
the Agricultural Marketing Loan Fund and any previously awarded agricultural development grant funds that have not 
been paid to grantees to the Agricultural Development Fund. The amount of these transfers will not be known until the 
transfer is made, but the bill includes a one-time allocation of $150,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 to allow expenditure of 
that amount. 
Under current law, an agricultural marketing loan that exceeds $100,000 may not exceed 75% of the total project cost 
and a loan of $100,000 or less may not exceed 90% of the total project cost. Under this bill the 75% cap is removed 
and all loans are limited to 90% of the total project cost. The bill also changes the interest rate for agricultural 
marketing loans from 5% per year to the federal prime rate on the date ofloan cormnitment up to a maximum of 5%. 
This change may reduce interest received on loans and credited to the fund for future use. The reduction in interest 
earnings will depend on the number of loans issued at an interest rate lower than the current 5% rate.
