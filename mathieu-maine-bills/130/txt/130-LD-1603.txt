33 programs and make recommendations to improve the coordination and adequacy of

35 security for residents.  The committee shall consider the correlation among guaranteed 
36 basic income programs, a reduction in poverty, increased economic stability and the 
37 beneficial impact on the State of a guaranteed basic income program.  In developing 
38 recommendations, the committee shall:
39 (1)  Review opportunities to take advantage of options for the State available under 
40 federal law to improve the adequacy of safety net programs and work support 
41 programs or other essential resources to help individuals in need to meet basic 
42 needs;
Page 2 - 130LR0937(01)1 (2)  Examine the ways in which the State could better coordinate safety net 
2 programs and work support programs to simplify access and improve efficiency, 
3 including:

5 programs;
6 (b)  Facilitating automatic or allowing an individual to opt out of enrollment;
7 (c)  Integrating applications and application processes between programs and

11 programs and work support programs assistance;
12 (e)  Removing unnecessary barriers for individuals to access the safety net 
13 programs and work support programs for which those individuals are eligible;
14 (f)  Improving communication and knowledge sharing between governmental 
15 departments to ensure that accurate information is provided to individuals 
16 seeking assistance; and
17 (g)  Making the application process more efficient and capable of meeting the 
18 unique needs of the individuals who are applying for assistance;
19 (3)  Review opportunities to change policy and processes to reduce benefit cliffs 
20 and negative interactions between existing programs;
21 (4)  Determine how the State could improve access to safety net programs or work 
22 support programs for historically disadvantaged racial, indigenous and tribal 
23 populations with the goal of reducing racial and economic disparities in the State; 
24 and
25 (5)  Make eligibility requirements for safety net programs and work support 
26 programs clear and understandable for the public.
27 C.  The committee shall conduct periodic reviews of safety net programs and work 
28 support programs and report findings and recommendations, including any suggested 
29 legislation, annually to the office and the joint standing committee having jurisdiction
