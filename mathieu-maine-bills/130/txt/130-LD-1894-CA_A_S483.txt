Sec. 5. Water district charter language; development. The ConnectMaine 
Authority, as established by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 9203, in 
consultation with the Public Utilities Commission and the Office of the Public Advocate, 
shall develop standard charter provisions that may be used by a water district to help it 
develop a legislative proposal to amend its charter to operate broadband or other Internet 
access systems or to provide broadband or other Internet access services to the public. Once 
the standard charter provisions are developed, the authority shall make them available to 
the public and may provide to any water district assistance in adapting the standard charter 
provisions to address the needs of the water district.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. 
The amendment establishes a registration process administered by the Public Utilities 
Commission for consumer-owned public utilities seeking to expand into the provision of 
broadband or other Internet access services. Prior to exercising any authority it may have 
pursuant to other law, a consumer-owned public utility must register with the commission 
and identify a contact person knowledgeable about the proposed or planned broadband and 
Internet access systems activities. 
The amendment also makes changes to the Municipal Gigabit Broadband Network 
Access Fund instead of creating a new fund as proposed in the bill. The ConnectMaine 
Authority may award funds to provide grant matches to municipalities that are applying for 
grants from other sources that require fund matching. Grant match funding may be awarded 
only to applicants whose projects are consistent with the goals of the Municipal Gigabit 
Broadband Network Access Fund. Municipalities receiving funds for grant matching 
purposes are not subject to the 25% cash match requirement. The amendment also 
establishes a requirement that municipalities receiving grant match funding provide 
services to unserved community anchor institutions in the area into which they are 
extending services if those unserved community anchor institutions will provide the public 
with access to the Internet. The amendment requires the authority to engage in rulemaking 
to define "unserved community anchor institutions" and "project area" for the purposes of 
grant match funding. 
The amendment also directs the ConnectMaine Authority, in consultation with the 
Public Utilities Commission and the Office of the Public Advocate, to develop standard 
charter provisions that may be used by a water district to develop a legislative proposal to 
amend its charter to operate broadband or other Internet access systems or to provide 
broadband or other Internet access services to the public.

Changes to grants -Municipal Gigabit Broadband Network Access Fund 
Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
This bill makes changes to the Municipal Gigabit Broadband Network Access Fund by allowing the ConnectMaine 
Authority to award funds to provide grant matches to municipalities that are applying for grants from other sources 
that require fund matching without requiring a 25% cash match requirement from the municipality. Any additional 
costs to the Public Utilities Commission as a result of the registration process for consumer-owned utilities seeking to 
expand into the provision of broadband services are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
