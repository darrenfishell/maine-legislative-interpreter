35 subsection 19.  If funds are provided by a nongovernmental lender, including, but not 
36 limited to, banks and investment firms, the nongovernmental lender has the contractual 
37 right to receive commercial PACE assessment payments.  Commercial PACE financing 
38 may cover up to 100% of an energy savings improvement's costs, including audits, energy 
39 savings improvement development and application fees.
403.  Program administration; municipal participation and liability.  A commercial 
41 PACE program must be administered as follows.
42 A.  A municipality that has adopted a commercial PACE ordinance may:

22 property owner for or related to energy savings improvements financed under a 
23 commercial PACE program.
24 F.  The trust may collect fees necessary to administer commercial PACE programs.
254.  Quality assurance system.  Subject to the availability of funds, the trust shall, 
26 within one year of the establishment of a commercial PACE program under subsection 1,

28 a quality assurance system under this subsection, the trust shall consult with industry 
29 stakeholders, including, but not limited to, representatives of clean energy and energy 
30 efficiency programs, contractors and environmental, energy efficiency and labor 
31 organizations.
325.  Terms and conditions.  The trust may, by rule, establish terms and conditions under 
33 which municipalities and commercial property owners may participate in a commercial 
34 PACE program established under subsection 1, which may include, but are not limited to, 
35 terms and conditions related to program design, implementation and administration, cost 
36 sharing, collection of commercial PACE assessments and recording of liens.  The trust may 
37 vary the terms and conditions established under this subsection applicable to a participating 
38 municipality from those of other participating municipalities by mutual agreement with that 
39 municipality.  Any terms or conditions established by the trust may not conflict with other 
40 provisions of this chapter.
41 A commercial PACE assessment may be used to secure financing for the construction of a 
42 new building or facility.  Financing secured by a commercial PACE assessment for the 
43 construction of a new building or facility must be used for energy savings improvements 
44 on the property that significantly exceed the energy standards of the Maine Uniform 
Page 4 - 130LR0611(01)45 Building and Energy Code, adopted pursuant to Title 10, section 9722, subsection 6,

101.  Underwriting.  A commercial PACE agreement entered into pursuant to a 
11 commercial PACE program must comply with underwriting requirements established by 
12 rule by the trust.  Underwriting requirements established by the trust must, at a minimum:
13 A.  Provide that the term of the commercial PACE agreement not exceed the estimated 
14 useful life of the financed energy savings improvements;
15 B.  Require that the estimated cost savings from the energy savings improvements over 
16 the useful life of such improvements achieve for the property owner a savings-to-
17 investment ratio of not less than 1.0;
18 C.  Require that the qualifying property have a debt service coverage ratio of not less 
19 than 1.0 at the time the commercial PACE agreement is entered into;
20 D.  Require that the qualifying property have a loan-to-value ratio of not more than 1.0 
21 at the time the commercial PACE agreement is entered into, calculated by dividing the 
22 total amount of debt secured by the property by the property value;
23 E.  Require that the qualifying property's assessment-to-value ratio be no greater than 
24 0.35;
25 F.  Require proof of ownership of the qualifying property;
26 G.  Require that the qualifying property:
27 (1)  Be current on property taxes and sewer charges;
28 (2)  Have no outstanding and unsatisfied tax or sewer liens; and
29 (3)  Not be subject to a mortgage or other lien on which there is a recorded notice

34§10205.  Commercial PACE assessments; collection; priority
351.  Collection of assessments.  A lender providing financing under a commercial 
36 PACE program has a lien on the qualifying property to secure the payment of an unpaid 
37 commercial PACE assessment.  A lien resulting from a commercial PACE assessment on 
38 the qualifying property must be assessed and collected by the trust, a 3rd-party 
39 administrator contracted by the trust, a municipality or an agent designated by the trust or 
40 a municipality in any manner allowed under the commercial PACE program, consistent 
41 with applicable laws.  If the trust or a 3rd-party administrator contracted by the trust collects 1
2
3
4
Page 5 - 130LR0611(01)42 commercial PACE assessments on behalf of a municipality, the trust shall periodically 
43 report to the municipality on the status of the commercial PACE assessments in the 
44 municipality and shall notify the municipality immediately of any delinquent commercial 
45 PACE assessments.  Upon receiving notification from the trust of a delinquent commercial 
46 PACE assessment, a municipality shall notify the holder of any mortgage on the property 
47 of the delinquent assessment.
72.  Notice; filing.  A notice of a commercial PACE agreement must be filed in the 
8 appropriate registry of deeds.  The filing of this notice creates a commercial PACE lien 
9 against the property subject to the commercial PACE assessment until the amounts due 
10 under the terms of the commercial PACE agreement are paid in full.  A notice filed under 
11 this subsection must, at a minimum, include:
12 A.  The amount of funds disbursed or to be disbursed pursuant to the commercial PACE 
13 agreement;
14 B.  The names and addresses of the current owners of the qualifying property subject 
15 to the commercial PACE assessment;
16 C.  A description of the qualifying property subject to the commercial PACE 
17 assessment, including its tax map and lot number;
18 D.  The duration of the commercial PACE agreement;
19 E.  The name and address of the entity filing the notice; and
20 F.  Written verification of mortgage lender consent, if there is a mortgage on the 
21 property.
223.  Priority.  A commercial PACE lien secures payment for any unpaid commercial 
23 PACE assessment and, together with all associated interest and penalties for default and 
24 associated attorney's fees and collection costs, takes precedence over all other liens or 
25 encumbrances except a lien for real property taxes of the municipality and liens of 
26 municipal sewer and water districts.  From the date of recording, a commercial PACE lien 
27 is a priority lien against a property, subject only to liens set out in section 6111-A, Title 36, 
28 section 552 and Title 38, sections 1050 and 1208, except that the priority of such a 
29 commercial PACE lien over any lien, except for a lien held by a sewer, water or other 
30 municipal district, that existed prior to the commercial PACE lien is subject to the written 
31 consent of such existing lienholder.
324.  Mortgage lender notice and consent.  Any financial institution holding a lien, 
33 mortgage or security interest in or other collateral encumbrance on the property for which 
34 a commercial PACE assessment is sought must be provided written notice of the 
35 commercial property owner's intention to participate in the commercial PACE program and 
36 must acknowledge in writing to the commercial property owner and municipality that the 
37 financial institution has received such notice.  A commercial PACE assessment may not be 
38 approved until the financial institution holding the lien, mortgage or security interest in or 
39 other collateral encumbrance on the property has provided written consent to the 
40 commercial property owner and municipality that the borrower may participate and enroll 
41 the collateral property in the commercial PACE program.  This written consent must be 
42 filed in the registry of deeds.
435.  Collection, default and foreclosure.  A commercial PACE assessment for which 
44 notice is properly recorded under this section creates a lien on the property.  The portion of 1
2
3
4
5
6
Page 6 - 130LR0611(01)45 the assessment that has not yet become due is not eliminated by foreclosure, and the lien 
46 may not be accelerated or extinguished until fully repaid.
3 A lien created by a commercial PACE assessment recorded in the registry of deeds and any 
4 interest, fees, penalties and attorney's fees incurred in its collection must be collected in the 
5 same manner as the real property taxes of the municipality in which the property is located. 
6 If a commercial PACE assessment is delinquent or in default, collection may occur only 
7 by the recording of liens and by foreclosure under Title 36, sections 942 and 943. Liens 
8 must be recorded and released in the same manner as liens for real property taxes.
96.  Judicial or nonjudicial sale or foreclosure by 3rd-party lienholder.  In the event 
10 of a judicial or nonjudicial sale or foreclosure by a 3rd-party lienholder of a property subject 
11 to a commercial PACE lien, the lien must survive the foreclosure or sale to the extent of 
12 any unpaid installment, interest, penalties or fees secured by the lien that were not paid 
13 from the proceeds of the sale.  All parties with mortgages or liens on that property, 
14 including without limitation commercial PACE lienholders, must receive on account of 
15 such mortgages or liens sale proceeds in accordance with the priority established in this 
16 chapter and by applicable law.  A commercial PACE assessment is not eliminated by 
17 foreclosure and cannot be accelerated.  Only the portion of a commercial PACE assessment 
18 that is in arrears at the time of foreclosure takes precedence over other mortgages or liens; 
19 the remainder transfers with the property at resale.
20 Unless otherwise agreed upon by the lender, all payments on a commercial PACE 
21 assessment that become due after the date of transfer by judicial or nonjudicial sale or 
22 foreclosure must continue to be secured by a lien on the property and are the responsibility 
23 of the transferee.
247.  Release of lien.  A municipality shall discharge a commercial PACE lien created 
25 under subsection 2 upon full payment of the amount specified in the commercial PACE 
26 agreement. A discharge under this subsection must be filed in the appropriate registry of 
27 deeds and must include reference to the notice required under subsection 2.
28§10206.  Commercial property owners
291.  Purchase of goods and services.  A commercial property owner who has entered 
30 into a commercial PACE agreement under this chapter may purchase directly all goods and 
31 services for the energy savings improvements described in the commercial PACE 
32 agreement, subject to any applicable vendor certification required by the trust and other 
33 requirements of the trust.  Goods and services purchased by a commercial property owner 
34 for the energy savings improvements under a commercial PACE agreement are not subject 
35 to any public procurement ordinance or statute.
362.  Rights.  Commercial property owners retain all rights under contract or law against 
37 parties other than the municipality or the trust with respect to energy savings improvements 
38 financed through commercial PACE agreements.
39§10207.  Annual report
40 The trust shall report annually on the implementation of this chapter as part of the report 
41 required under section 10104, subsection 5.
42§10208.  Rulemaking1
2
Page 7 - 130LR0611(01)1 Rules adopted under this chapter are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
2 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
3§10209.  Construction; home rule
4 Nothing in this chapter may be construed to limit the home rule authority of a 
5 municipality.
6§10210.  Conformity to changed standards
7 If standards are adopted by any state or federal agency subsequent to a municipality's 
8 adoption of a commercial PACE ordinance or participation in a commercial PACE program 
9 and those standards substantially conflict with the municipality's manner of participation 
10 in the commercial PACE program, the municipality shall take necessary steps to conform 
11 its participation to those standards.
12SUMMARY
13 This bill allows the Efficiency Maine Trust or a municipality to establish a commercial 
14 property assessed clean energy program to finance energy savings improvements on 
15 qualifying property.
