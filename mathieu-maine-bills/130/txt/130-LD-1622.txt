37 conduct market, legal and feasibility analyses if the board considers them advisable;
38 B. Adopt rules the board considers necessary or advisable for the implementation and 
39 general administration and operation of the program as provided in section 174, 
40 consistent with the Internal Revenue Code and regulations under that Code, including

14 return opportunities and allow for a rate of return commensurate with an appropriate 
15 level of risk in view of the investment objectives under the policy. The menu of 
16 investment options must be determined by considering the nature and objectives of the 
17 program, the desirability based on behavioral research findings of limiting investment 
18 options under the program to a reasonable number and the extensive investment options

21 and O, the board, in carrying out its responsibilities and exercising its powers under

18 reference to online data and possible use of questions in employer state tax filings, 
19 consistent with the objective of avoiding to the fullest extent practicable any need to 
20 require employers that are not covered employers to register with the program or take 
21 other action to demonstrate that they maintain specified tax-favored retirement plans 
22 or are exempt for other reasons from being treated as covered employers;  
23 K.  Employ or otherwise retain a program administrator, an executive director, staff, a

28 responsibilities under the program; 
29 P. Ensure that all contributions to an IRA under the program are used only to pay 
30 benefits to participants under the program, pay the cost of administering the program

43 for an annual increase of each participant's contribution rate, by not more than 1% of 
Page 8 - 130LR0921(01)44 salary or wages per year up to a maximum of 8%.  Any such increases must apply to

9 participant's initial contributions, up to a specified dollar amount or for a specified

21 operation and implementation of the program to be carried out jointly with, or in 
22 partnership, collaboration, coordination or alliance with one or more other states, the

34 employees is not required to offer the program to its covered employees but may offer the 
35 program to its employees at the option of the employer. 
364.  Penalties.  The board shall establish and enforce penalties in accordance with this 
37 subsection. 
38 A. If a covered employer fails to enroll a covered employee without reasonable cause,

12 B. A penalty may not be imposed on a covered employer for any failure to enroll a 
13 covered employee for which it is established that the covered employer did not know 
14 that the failure existed and exercised reasonable diligence to meet the requirements of 
15 this chapter.
16 C.  A penalty may not be imposed on a covered employer for any failure to enroll a 
17 covered employee if the covered employer exercised reasonable diligence to meet the 
18 requirements of this chapter and the covered employer complies with those 
19 requirements with respect to each covered employee by the end of the 90-day period 
20 beginning on the first date the covered employer knew, or exercising reasonable 
21 diligence would have known, that the failure existed. 
22 D. In the case of a failure that is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, all 
23 or part of the penalty may be waived to the extent that the payment of the penalty would 
24 be excessive or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure involved.
25 E. If a covered employer fails to remit a payroll deduction contribution to the program 
26 on the earliest date the amount withheld from the covered employee's compensation 
27 can reasonably be segregated from the covered employer's assets, but not later than the 
28 15th day of the month following the month in which the covered employee's 
29 contribution amounts are withheld from the covered employee's paycheck, the failure 
30 to remit the contribution on a timely basis is subject to the same penalties as apply to 
31 employer misappropriation of employee wage withholdings and to the penalties 
32 specified in paragraph A.
33 F. The Attorney General shall represent the board in enforcement and collection of 
34 penalties.

23 and may not be considered a fiduciary in relation to the program or enterprise fund or any 
24 other arrangement under the program. A covered employer or other employer is not and

392.  Protection for the State and others.  The State, the board, each member of the 
40 board or other state official and any other state board, commission or agency, and any 
41 member, officer or employee of any of these entities, and the program:1

143. Debts, contracts and obligations.  The debts, contracts and obligations of the

19 and all tort claims seeking recovery of damages to the same extent as governmental entities 
20 under the Maine Tort Claims Act.
215.  Legal representation and defense of board.  The Attorney General is legal counsel 
22 to the board and shall represent and defend the board, as a group and individually, in 
23 connection with any claim, suit or action at law arising out of the performance or 
24 nonperformance of any actions related to the program under this chapter to the same extent 
25 as provided for governmental entities in the Maine Tort Claims Act.  
26§176.  Confidentiality of account information
271. Individual account information.  Individual account information for accounts 
28 under the program, including, but not limited to, names, residential addresses, e-mail 
29 addresses, telephone numbers, personal identification information, amounts contributed 
30 and earnings on amounts contributed, is confidential and must be maintained as 
31 confidential except to the extent necessary to administer the program in a manner consistent

33 person who provides the information or is the subject of the information expressly agrees 
34 in writing that the information may be disclosed.
352. Restriction on use of personal information.  An individual or organization that has 
36 access to personal information of participants solely because of its contracts or agreements 
37 with the board to provide services or support to the program, including plan administration, 
38 may not use that information to market its products or services not associated with the 
39 program to participants unless the participant affirmatively consents to receive such 
40 information.
41§177.  Intergovernmental collaboration and cooperation
42 The board may enter into an intergovernmental agreement or memorandum of 
43 understanding with the State and any agency or instrumentality of the State to receive 
Page 14 - 130LR0921(01)44 outreach, technical assistance, enforcement and compliance services, collection or 
45 dissemination of information pertinent to the program, subject to such obligations of 
46 confidentiality as may be agreed to or required by law, or other services or assistance.  The 
47 State and any agencies or instrumentalities of the State that enter into such agreements or 
48 memoranda of understanding shall collaborate to provide the outreach, assistance, 
49 information and compliance or other services or assistance to the board. The agreements or 
50 memoranda of understanding may cover the sharing of costs incurred in gathering and 
51 disseminating information and the reimbursement of costs for any enforcement activities 
52 or assistance.
10§178. Maine Retirement Savings Program Enterprise Fund
111. Fund established.  The Maine Retirement Savings Program Enterprise Fund is 
12 established as an enterprise fund.  The board shall use funds deposited in the enterprise 
13 fund in accordance with this section.  The enterprise fund may receive grants, gifts, 
14 donations, appropriations, loans or other funds designated for administrative expenses or 
15 otherwise transferred to the enterprise fund from or deposited in the enterprise fund by the 
16 State or a unit of federal, state or local government or any other person, firm, partnership 
17 or corporation, including appropriations to the enterprise fund by the Legislature and funds 
18 from the payment of application, account, administrative or other fees and the payment of 
19 other funds due the board.  Interest or other investment earnings or returns that are 
20 attributable to funds in the enterprise fund must be deposited into or retained in the 
21 enterprise fund.  The enterprise fund may not lapse but must be carried forward to carry 
22 out the purposes of this chapter. The board shall amortize any amounts appropriated to the 
23 enterprise fund by the Legislature to ensure that those amounts are paid back to the funding 
24 sources based on an amortization schedule determined by the board, but no later than 5 
25 years after the program is fully implemented.  
262. Borrowing.  To enable or facilitate the start-up and continuing operation, 
27 maintenance, administration and management of the program until the program 
28 accumulates sufficient balances and can generate sufficient funding through fees assessed 
29 on program accounts for the program to become financially self-sustaining, the board may 
30 borrow from the State, any unit of federal, state or local government or any other person, 
31 firm, partnership or corporation working capital funds and other funds as may be necessary 
32 for this purpose, as long as such funds are borrowed in the name of the program and board 
33 only and that any such borrowing is repaid solely from the revenues of the program. The 
34 board may not borrow from the retirement system for any purpose. The board may enter 
35 into long-term procurement contracts with one or more financial or service providers that 
36 provide a fee structure that would assist the program in avoiding or minimizing the need to 
37 borrow or to rely upon general assets of the State.
383. Administrative costs.  Subject to appropriation by the Legislature, the State may 
39 pay administrative costs associated with the creation, maintenance, operation and 
40 management of the program and provide funding for the program until sufficient assets are 
41 available in the enterprise fund for that purpose. Thereafter, all administrative costs of the 
42 enterprise fund, including any repayment of start-up funds provided by the State, must be 
43 repaid only out of money on deposit in the enterprise fund. However, private funds or 
44 federal funding received in order to implement the program until the enterprise fund is self-
45 sustaining may not be repaid unless those funds were offered contingent upon the promise 
46 of such repayment.1

Page 15 - 130LR0921(01)14. Use of enterprise fund.  The board shall use the money in the enterprise fund solely 
2 to pay the administrative costs and expenses of the program and the administrative costs 
3 and expenses the board incurs in the performance of its duties under this chapter. 
4§179.  Accounting and annual report
51. Account; audit.  The board shall cause an accurate account of all of the program's, 
6 enterprise fund's and board's activities, operations, receipts and expenditures to be 
7 maintained on a calendar year basis. A full audit of the books and accounts of the board 
8 pertaining to those activities, operations, receipts and expenditures must be conducted by 
9 a certified public accountant, including, but not limited to, direct and indirect costs 
10 attributable to the use of outside consultants, independent contractors and any other persons 
11 who are not state employees for the administration of the program.  For the purposes of the 
12 audit, the auditors must have access to the properties and records of the program and board 
13 and may prescribe methods of accounting and the rendering of periodic reports in relation 
14 to projects undertaken by the program.  
152. Submission of report.  Beginning February 1, 2024 and annually thereafter, the 
16 board shall submit to the Governor, the Treasurer of State and the Legislature an audited 
17 financial report, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
18 detailing the activities, operations, receipts and expenditures of the program and board 
19 during the preceding calendar year. The report must include the number of participants, the 
20 investment options and their rates of return and other information regarding the program 
21 and must also include projected activities of the program for the current calendar year.

State Maine Retirement Savings Board Legislative Per 
Diem and

24Sec. 3.  Implementation of Maine Retirement Savings Program.  Except as 
25 provided in this section, the Maine Retirement Savings Board shall establish the Maine 
26 Retirement Savings Program as required under this Act so that individuals may begin 
27 making contributions under the program no later than April 1, 2023. The board shall phase 
28 in the program with regard to covered employers and accept contributions from covered 
29 employees employed by those covered employers as required under this Act and may in its 
30 discretion phase in the program for individuals who are not employees, such as self-
31 employed individuals or independent contractors, except that any implementation schedule 
32 set by the board must be such that all individuals may begin making contributions under 
33 the program no later than January 1, 2025. The board may not implement the program if 
34 and to the extent that the board determines that the program is preempted by the federal 
35 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, 29 United States Code, 
36 Section 1001 et seq.  If and to the extent that the board determines that a portion or aspect 
37 of the program is preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
38 1974, the board may not implement that portion or aspect of the program but shall proceed 
39 to implement the remainder of the program to the extent practicable. If the board determines 
40 that some but not all of the payroll deduction individual retirement account arrangements 
41 or other arrangements under the program are or would be employee benefit plans under the 
42 federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the board shall implement the 24

46 to plans covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 on a 
47 basis reflecting their status or possible status as such, as long as such actions do not create 
48 an undue risk of causing the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to 
49 preempt state law with respect to other portions of the program or causing other 
50 arrangements under the program to be treated as plans covered by the federal Employee 
51 Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
10Sec. 4.  Staggered terms.  Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, 
11 section 172, subsection 3, with regard to the original appointments of the members of the 
12 Maine Retirement Savings Board, the Governor shall appoint one member for a one-year
