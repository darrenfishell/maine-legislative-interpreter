Page 10 - 130LR2380(01)45 member.  The total value of the benefit paid to the qualifying member during the qualifying 
46 member's life plus the benefit paid after the qualifying member's death is the actuarial 
47 equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have received without optional 
48 modification.  The method used to determine the benefit must be approved by the board, 
49 and the beneficiary must be designated by written designation, duly notarized 
50 acknowledged and filed with the  chief executive  director  officer on a form provided or 
51 specified by the retirement system.

13 paid to the survivor for the survivor's life.  The total value of the benefit paid to the

15 be paid after the death of either is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying 
16 member would have received without optional modification.  The method used to 
17 determine the benefit must be approved by the board, and the beneficiary must be 
18 designated by written designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief

26 notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive  director  officer on a form 
27 provided or specified by the retirement system, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying 
28 member.  If the qualifying member's beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the 
29 qualifying member's benefit shall  must be changed, effective the first day of the month 
30 following the date of the beneficiary's death, to be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit 
31 that the qualifying member would have received without optional modification.  The 
32 reduced retirement benefit must be actuarially calculated to reflect the fact that the benefit 
33 may be changed to the larger amount should the beneficiary predecease the member.

37 payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's death, to 
38 have the benefit continued at 1/2 that amount for the life of the beneficiary, who must be 
39 the sole beneficiary, that the qualifying member has designated by written designation, duly 
40 notarized acknowledged and filed with the  chief executive  director  officer on a form 
41 provided or specified by the retirement system, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying 
42 member.  If the qualifying member's beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the 
43 qualifying member's benefit must be changed, effective the first day of the month following

7 has designated someone other than a spouse or ex-spouse as sole beneficiary, the recipient 
8 is permitted a one-time change in the designated beneficiary except as provided in 
9 paragraph D, but may not change the already elected payment option or the amount of the 
10 benefits under that option, by filing a written designation of the new beneficiary, duly

12 specified by the retirement system.  The change of beneficiary permitted by this subsection 
13 may only be made prior to the death of the prior designated beneficiary.
14 A.  The benefit payable to the recipient and the new beneficiary must be paid under the 
15 same payment option.  The amount of the recipient's benefit may not change, and the 
16 amount of the new beneficiary's benefit must be the same as the amount of the prior 
17 beneficiary's benefit.

19 designation is received by the chief executive  director  officer.  As of the first day of 
20 the month following the effective date of the designation of the new beneficiary, the 
21 prior beneficiary is no longer entitled to any benefit payment and, if concurrent 
22 payment under subsection 5‑B has been elected, the new beneficiary's benefit must 
23 become effective on the same date.
24 C.  The new beneficiary's entitlement to benefits ceases on the earlier of:
25 (1)  The date of the new beneficiary's death; or
26 (2)  The date established when the amount of the prior beneficiary's benefit was 
27 established, which is the initial commencement date of benefits to the retiree 
28 increased by the life expectancy of the prior beneficiary computed in years and 
29 months using actuarial equivalence assumptions recommended by the system's 
30 actuary.
31 Payment of benefits to the new beneficiary must cease as of the first day of the month 
32 following the earlier of subparagraph  subparagraphs (1)  or and (2).
33 D.  A recipient who exercises a one-time option under this subsection may revert back 
34 to the original designated beneficiary, who will be treated as the new beneficiary for 
35 purposes of paragraphs A to C.
