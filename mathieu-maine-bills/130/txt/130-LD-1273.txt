Page 1 - 130LR1154(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA c. 301, sub-c. 5 is enacted to read:
3SUBCHAPTER 5
4CONVICTION INTEGRITY UNITS
5§1861.  Conviction integrity units
61.  Conviction integrity units.  The Attorney General and every district attorney under 
7 Title 30-A, chapter 1, subchapter 5 shall maintain within their respective offices a 
8 conviction integrity unit that timely reviews the convictions resulting in imprisonment of 
9 criminal cases prosecuted by the Attorney General's or that district attorney's office to 
10 determine whether errors were committed justifying a post-conviction review of the 
11 conviction.
122.  Review.  A conviction integrity unit shall review a conviction in its office that 
13 contains:
14 A.  Facts that suggest a plausible claim of innocence; 
15 B.  Evidence of a constitutional violation or prosecutorial misconduct; or 
16 C.  Facts or circumstances requiring a review in the interests of fairness or justice.
17 That a person pleaded guilty or is no longer incarcerated is not an impediment to the 
18 person's conviction being reviewed under this chapter.  The conviction integrity unit may 
19 conduct a review of a conviction upon its own initiative or upon a referral from another 
20 person.  The conviction integrity unit shall conduct a periodic audit of convictions 
21 prosecuted by the unit's office to determine eligibility of review under this subsection.
223.  Investigation.  An investigation of a conviction under subsection 2 must include a 
23 review of all files, evidence, work product, notes, laboratory records, personnel files and 
24 other information possessed or obtained by the State in the course of or relevant to the 
25 underlying case, any evidence proffered by the defendant or others and further facts or 
26 evidence that may support a review under subsection 2 whether or not the facts or evidence 
27 was available or proffered by the defense at the time of trial.  An investigation may include 
28 coordination and cooperation with defense counsel, the defendant, witnesses or others, 
29 including documents, electronic files or laboratory or other records, to determine the facts 
30 and circumstances supporting a review under subsection 2.
314.  Convictions involving allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.  A conviction 
32 involving a substantial, nonconclusory allegation of prosecutorial misconduct by a present 
33 or former member of the conviction integrity unit's office must be referred to an 
34 independent authority for investigation and review. This referral must include both the 
35 allegation of misconduct as well as any included claim of innocence, constitutional 
36 violation or interests of fairness or justice.
375.  Certain individuals precluded from conducting review.  An attorney who 
38 prosecuted or was substantially involved in a conviction may not participate in the 
39 conviction integrity unit's review of that conviction.
Page 2 - 130LR1154(01)16.  Recommendation; relief; petition.  If a conviction integrity unit determines 
2 appropriate based upon the review and investigation, the unit shall make in a timely manner 
3 a recommendation to the Attorney General or district attorney in whose office the 
4 conviction integrity unit is located whether to petition for post-conviction review under 
5 chapter 305-A and the relief to be sought.  The relief must be by agreement with the 
6 defendant and may include dismissal of the conviction, recharging the defendant and 
7 conviction of a lesser charge, reduction or termination of a sentence or other disposition.  
8 The Attorney General or district attorney may file a petition based upon the 
9 recommendation.
107.  Report.  The Attorney General and every district attorney shall submit an annual 
11 report on the activities of the conviction integrity unit in the Attorney General's or that 
12 district attorney's office, collected by the Attorney General and transmitted to the joint 
13 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over criminal justice and public 
14 safety matters.  The report must include:
15 A.  The number and nature of convictions reviewed, including:
16 (1)  The total number of referrals received;
17 (2)  The number of convictions in which trials had occurred;
18 (3)  The number of convictions that had resulted in a plea;
19 (4)  The number of convictions for which prior state or federal post‐conviction 
20 petitions had been filed and adjudicated; and
21 (5)  The source of referrals, including from pro se defendants, innocence 
22 organizations, the defense bar, news media or other persons or from office-initiated 
23 investigations pursuant to audits arising from prior wrongful conviction matters 
24 including audits involving individual prosecutors, police officers or forensic 
25 techniques;
26 B.  The outcomes of reviews, including:
27 (1)  The number of convictions in which a decision was made not to undertake an 
28 investigation;
29 (2)  The number of convictions in which an investigation was undertaken;
30 (3)  The number of convictions for which relief was granted, the nature of that 
31 relief and the grounds for providing that relief;
32 (4)  The number of convictions where an investigation was undertaken and no 
33 agreement made between the parties resulting in continuing post‐conviction 
34 litigation and the status or result of that litigation; and
35 (5)  The number of convictions referred for independent review and investigation 
36 due to a substantial, nonconclusory allegation of misconduct by a prosecutor; and
37 C.  An analysis of the lesson learned and solution recommended for an error identified 
38 in the course of the activities of the conviction integrity unit, including identification 
39 of the root cause of the error, the potential use of an independent external expert to 
40 conduct a forensic review of the error, a reexamination of cases with similar or like 
41 facts or root causes and recommended policy change and implementation.
Page 3 - 130LR1154(01)1Sec. 2.  15 MRSA §2122, as amended by PL 2011, c. 601, §4, is further amended to 
2 read:
3§2122.  Purpose
4 This chapter provides a comprehensive and, except for direct appeals from a criminal 
5 judgment, exclusive method of review of those criminal judgments and of post-sentencing 
6 proceedings occurring during the course of and subsequent to sentences.  It is a remedy for 
7 unfair, unjust or illegal restraint and other impediments specified in section 2124 that have 
8 occurred directly or indirectly as a result of an unfair, unjust or illegal criminal judgment 
9 or post-sentencing proceeding.  It replaces the remedies available pursuant to post-
10 conviction habeas corpus, to the extent that review of a criminal conviction or proceedings 
11 were reviewable, the remedies available pursuant to common law habeas corpus, including 
12 habeas corpus as recognized in Title 14, sections 5501 and 5509 to 5546, coram nobis, 
13 audita querela, writ of error, declaratory judgment and any other previous common law or 
14 statutory method of review, except appeal of a judgment of conviction or juvenile 
15 adjudication and remedies that are incidental to proceedings in the trial court.  The 
16 substantive extent of the remedy of post-conviction review is defined in this chapter and 
17 not defined in the remedies that it replaces; provided that this .  This chapter provides and 
18 is must be construed to provide relief for those persons required to use this chapter as 
19 required by the Constitution of Maine, Article I, Section 10.
20Sec. 3.  15 MRSA §2123, sub-§1-A, as amended by PL 2003, c. 29, §2, is further 
21 amended to read:
221-A.  Supreme Court Justice or authorized Judge of the District Court.  A single 
23 Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, an Active Retired Justice of the Supreme Judicial 
24 Court or a judge authorized to sit in the Superior Court on post-conviction review cases has 
25 and shall exercise jurisdiction and has and shall exercise all of the powers, duties and 
26 authority necessary for exercising the same jurisdiction as the Superior Court relative to a 
27 post-conviction review proceeding.  If a petition is brought under section 1861, the justice 
28 or judge who presided over the underlying conviction may not preside over the post-
29 conviction review of the case.
30Sec. 4.  15 MRSA §2125, as amended by PL 2013, c. 266, §4, is further amended to 
31 read:
32§2125.  Ground for relief
33 A person who satisfies the prerequisites of section 2124 may show that the challenged 
34 criminal judgment or sentence is unlawful or unlawfully imposed,  or unfair or unjust under 
35 section 1861 or that the impediment resulting from the challenged post-sentencing 
36 proceeding is unlawful, as a result of any error or ground for relief, whether or not of record, 
37 unless the error is harmless or unless relief is unavailable for a reason provided in section 
38 2126, section 2128 unless section 2128‐A applies, or section 2128‐B.
39Sec. 5.  15 MRSA §2126, as amended by PL 2013, c. 266, §5, is further amended to 
40 read:
41§2126.  Exhaustion
42 A Except for a proceeding brought under section 1861, a person under restraint or 
43 impediment specified in section 2124 must also demonstrate that the person has previously 
Page 4 - 130LR1154(01)44 exhausted remedies incidental to proceedings in the trial court, on appeal or administrative 
45 remedies.  A person who has taken an appeal from a judgment of conviction, a juvenile 
46 adjudication or a judgment of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity is not 
47 precluded from utilizing the remedy of this chapter while the appeal is pending.  The post-
48 conviction review proceeding is automatically stayed pending resolution of the appeal 
49 unless the Appellate Court on motion and for good cause otherwise directs.
7Sec. 6.  15 MRSA §2128, first ¶, as amended by PL 2011, c. 601, §9, is further 
8 amended to read:
9 A Except for a proceeding brought under section 1861, a person under restraint or 
10 impediment specified in section 2124 shall demonstrate that any ground of relief has not 
11 been waived.  The bases of waiver are as follows.
12Sec. 7.  15 MRSA §2128-B, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
134.  Filing deadline for resentencing review.  A petition filed pursuant to section 1861 
14 may be brought at any time after the issuance of conviction.
15Sec. 8.  15 MRSA §2129, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2003, c. 29, §3, is further 
16 amended to read:
171.  Filing of petition.  Petitions shall must be filed as follows.
18 A.  A proceeding for post-conviction review shall must be commenced by filing a 
19 petition in the Superior Court in the county specified in section 2123.
20 B.  If Except for a petition brought pursuant to section 1861, if the petitioner desires to 
21 have counsel appointed, he the petitioner shall file an affidavit of indigency in the form 
22 prescribed by the Supreme Judicial Court.  If the petitioner is incarcerated, the affidavit 
23 shall must be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate officer of the institution 
24 in which the petitioner is incarcerated as to the amount of money or securities on 
25 deposit to the petitioner's credit in any account in the institution.  The failure to include 
26 an affidavit of indigency with the petition does not bar the court from appointing 
27 counsel upon a subsequent filing of an affidavit of indigency.
28 C.  Once the petition has been filed, the clerk shall forward a copy of the petition and 
29 any separate documents filed with it to the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and to 
30 the prosecutorial office that earlier represented the State in the underlying criminal or 
31 juvenile proceeding or, for a petition brought under section 1861, to the person whose 
32 conviction is being reviewed.
33Sec. 9.  15 MRSA §2129, sub-§12 is enacted to read:
3412.  Standard of proof for claims of innocence.  The standard of review for a petition 
35 filed under section 1861 claiming innocence is by clear and convincing evidence.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill requires the Attorney General and every district attorney to maintain a 
38 conviction integrity unit to review convictions in cases they prosecuted to determine 
39 whether there is plausible evidence of innocence, a constitutional violation or prosecutorial 
40 misconduct or when the facts and circumstances require a review in the interests of fairness 
41 and justice.  A conviction integrity unit may recommend that a conviction be dismissed or 1

43 or other disposition upon agreement with the defendant.  The Attorney General or district 
44 attorney may file a petition for post-conviction review based upon that recommendation.  
45 Prosecutors are prohibited from participating in the review of cases that they prosecuted 
46 and justices and judges are prohibited from presiding over the post-conviction review of 
47 cases over which they presided.  Cases of prosecutorial misconduct must be reviewed by 
48 an independent authority.  The standard of review for petitions claiming innocence is by 
49 clear and convincing evidence.1
