Page 1 - 130LR1231(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §2452, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 385, §11, is repealed 
3 and the following enacted in its place:
41.  Discrimination prohibited; rating practices.  A policy of employee benefit excess 
5 insurance may not discriminate unfairly among or against beneficiaries of the underlying 
6 benefit plan, or treat conditions related to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, 
7 more restrictively than other sicknesses or disabling conditions.
8 The following requirements apply to the rating practices of carriers providing employee 
9 excess benefit insurance to small group health plans.
10 A.  A carrier may not vary the premium rate due to the gender, health status, claims 
11 experience or policy duration of the eligible group or members of the group or any 
12 other rating factor not specified in this subsection.
13 B.  A carrier may vary the premium rate due to family membership and participation 
14 in wellness programs.  The premium rate for a family must equal the sum of the 
15 premiums for each individual in the family, except that it may not be based on more 
16 than 3 dependent children who are less than 21 years of age.  The superintendent may 
17 adopt rules setting forth appropriate methodologies regarding rate discounts for 
18 participation in wellness programs.  Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph are 
19 routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
20 C.  A carrier may vary the premium rate due to geographic area in accordance with the 
21 limitation in this paragraph.  For all policies, contracts or certificates that are executed, 
22 delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after October 1, 
23 2021, the rating factor used by a carrier for geographic area may not exceed 1.5.
24 D.  A carrier may vary the premium rate due to age, group size and tobacco use in 
25 accordance with the limitations set out in this paragraph.  A carrier that varies the 
26 premium rate due to age must vary the premium rate according to a uniform age curve.  
27 The superintendent shall adopt rules establishing a uniform age curve that is 
28 substantially similar to the age curve in effect on January 1, 2019 under the federal 
29 Affordable Care Act.
30 (1)  For all policies, contracts or certificates that are executed, delivered, issued for 
31 delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after January 1, 2022, except as 
32 provided in subparagraph (3), the maximum rate differential due to age and group 
33 size filed by the carrier as determined by ratio is 5 to 1 to the extent permitted by 
34 the federal Affordable Care Act.  The limitation does not apply for determining 
35 rates for an attained age of less than 19 years of age or more than 65 years of age.
36 (2)  For all policies, contracts or certificates that are executed, delivered, issued for 
37 delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after October 1, 2021, the 
38 maximum rate differential due to tobacco use filed by the carrier as determined by 
39 ratio is 1.5 to 1, except that the carrier may not apply a rate differential pursuant to 
40 this subparagraph when the covered individual is participating in an evidence-
41 based tobacco cessation strategy approved by the United States Department of 
42 Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration.
Page 2 - 130LR1231(01)1 (3)  For all policies, contracts or certificates that are executed, delivered, issued for 
2 delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after October 1, 2021, the 
3 maximum rate differential due to age filed by the carrier as determined by ratio is 
4 3 to 1 for individuals 21 years of age and older on the first day of coverage under 
5 the policy, contract or certificate.  The variation in rate due to age must be 
6 actuarially justified for individuals under 21 years of age consistent with the 
7 uniform age curve adopted under this paragraph.
8Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §2452, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 385, §11, is repealed 
9 and the following enacted in its place:
103.  Review.  The review of employee benefit excess insurance forms, rates and filings 
11 is subject to this subsection.
12 A.  An employee benefit excess insurance form is not exempt from the review 
13 provisions otherwise applicable under section 2412 on the ground that the form is 
14 designed for insurance on a particular subject.
15 B.  If at any time the superintendent has reason to believe that a filing does not meet 
16 the requirements that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory or 
17 that the filing violates any of the provisions of chapter 23, the superintendent shall 
18 cause a hearing to be held.  Hearings held under this subsection must conform to the 
19 procedural requirements set forth in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4.  The 
20 superintendent shall issue an order or decision within 30 days after the close of the 
21 hearing or of any rehearing or reargument or within such other period as the 
22 superintendent for good cause may require, but not to exceed an additional 30 days. In 
23 the order or decision, the superintendent shall either approve or disapprove the rate 
24 filing.  If the superintendent disapproves the rate filing, the superintendent shall 
25 establish the date on which the filing is no longer effective, specify the filing the 
26 superintendent would approve and authorize the insurer to submit a new filing in 
27 accordance with the terms of the order or decision.
28 C.  When a filing is not accompanied by the information upon which the carrier 
29 supports the filing or the superintendent does not have sufficient information to 
30 determine whether the filing meets the requirements that rates not be excessive, 
31 inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, the superintendent shall require the carrier to 
32 furnish the information upon which it supports the filing.
33SUMMARY
34 This bill establishes rating practices for employee benefit excess insurance, including 
35 maximum rate differentials for age, group size and tobacco use.  This bill requires the 
36 Superintendent of Insurance to hold a hearing if the superintendent finds that a filing does 
37 not meet the requirement that rates not be excessive, inadequate or discriminatory or that it 
38 violates a prohibited trade practice or is fraudulent and establishes the procedure and 
39 consequences for the hearing.  This bill also requires the superintendent to require a carrier 
40 to provide more information if the superintendent finds that the filing does not have 
41 sufficient information to determine whether the filing meets the requirements.34
