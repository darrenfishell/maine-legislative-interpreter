8ยง1310-B-1.  Land Application Contaminant Monitoring Fund
91.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
10 following terms have the following meanings.
11 A.  "Fund" means the Land Application Contaminant Monitoring Fund under 
12 subsection 2.
13 B.  "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances" has the same meaning as in Title 
14 32, section 1732, subsection 5-A.
15 C.  "Residual" has the same meaning as in Title 7, section 4201, subsection 7.
162.  Land Application Contaminant Monitoring Fund.  The Land Application 
17 Contaminant Monitoring Fund is established to be used by the department as a nonlapsing, 
18 revolving fund to test and monitor soil and groundwater for perfluoroalkyl and 
19 polyfluoroalkyl substances and other contaminants and for other related activities.  The 
20 fund is funded by the fee under subsection 3 and any public or private funds that may be 
21 available for carrying out the purposes of the fund.  The department shall deposit with the 
22 Treasurer of State to the credit of the fund money in the fund not currently needed by the 
23 department to carry out the purposes of the fund, which may be invested as provided by 
24 law.  Interest earned on investment of money under this subsection must be credited to the 
25 fund. The department shall transfer money in the fund not used within 5 years of the receipt 
26 of the money to the Uncontrolled Sites Fund under section 1364, subsection 6 for the 
27 purposes of testing, monitoring or treating farmland contaminated by perfluoroalkyl and 
28 polyfluoroalkyl substances. The department shall report annually to the Legislature on the 
29 uses of the fund and a summary of contamination identified. 
303.  Disposal fee.  In addition to any other fee or charge required by statute or rule, the 
31 department shall assess a fee of $10 per ton on any disposal of septage, industrial sludge, 
32 municipal sludge, bioash, wood ash or other residual.  The department shall deposit a fee 
33 collected under this subsection into the fund.
34Sec. 3.  Testing of locations with land applications of residuals for 
35contamination of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The 
36 Department of Environmental Protection shall develop and implement a program to test 
37 soil and groundwater at locations historically licensed or permitted to apply residuals for 
38 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and other contaminants identified by the 
39 department.  Testing under this section must include measurement of all perfluoroalkyl and 
40 polyfluoroalkyl substances that reasonably may be quantified by a commercial laboratory.  
41 The department shall prioritize locations that received industrial residuals prior to 2015 and 
42 complete testing of these locations by July 31, 2022.  The department shall complete testing 
Page 2 - 130LR1114(01)43 of the remaining locations licensed or permitted to receive residuals prior to 2019 by July 
44 31, 2023. If the testing indicates an elevated level of contamination on land that is currently 
45 being used for the production of an agricultural product, the department shall inform the 
46 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry of the findings of contamination.  
47 Testing under this section must be paid for by funds from the Land Application 
48 Contaminant Monitoring Fund under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 
49 1310-B-1.  For purposes of this section, "perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances" 
50 has the same meaning as in Title 32, section 1732, subsection 5-A and "residual" has the 
51 same meaning as in Title 7, section 4201, subsection 7.
10SUMMARY
11 This bill creates the Land Application Contaminant Monitoring Fund to be used by the 
12 Department of Environmental Protection to test and monitor soil and groundwater for 
13 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and other contaminants and for other related 
14 activities.  The fund is funded by a $10 per ton fee assessed on any disposal of septage, 
15 industrial sludge, municipal sludge, bioash, wood ash or other residual, which is material 
16 generated as a by-product of a nonagricultural production or treatment process that has 
17 value as a source of crop nutrients or soil amendment.  This bill also requires the department 
18 to test land that has received residuals for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
19 and other contaminants and to notify the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
20 Forestry of the findings of any contamination of land currently being used for the 
21 production of agricultural products.1
