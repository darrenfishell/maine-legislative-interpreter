Page 1 - 130LR0440(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, direct care workers provide a valuable societal service for the people of 
4 Maine and often are grossly underpaid, to the disadvantage of the workers themselves and 
5 the people who they serve; and
6Whereas, provision for the relief of direct care workers was submitted through 
7 legislation in the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature, but the sudden 
8 adjournment of the session due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the legislation not 
9 becoming law; and
10Whereas, providing relief in wages for direct care workers is now even more pressing 
11 because of the delay; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15 therefore,
16Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17PART A
18Sec. A-1.  22 MRSA §1708, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
195.  Reimbursement rates for in-home and community support services.  The 
20 department shall establish rules concerning MaineCare reimbursement rates for in-home 
21 and community support services as defined in section 7302, subsection 5 that establish the 
22 base year for those services every 2 years and increase the rate of reimbursement beginning 
23 July 1, 2022 and every year thereafter until June 30, 2026. For the state fiscal year 
24 beginning July 1, 2026, the base year for each in-home and community support services 
25 provider is its fiscal year that ended in the calendar year 2024. For state fiscal years 
26 beginning on or after July 1, 2027, subsequent rebasing must be based on the most recent 
27 cost report filings available. The department may provide a mechanism for subsequent 
28 adjustments to base year costs to reflect any material difference between as-filed cost 
29 reports used in rebasing and subsequent determinations of audited, allowable costs for the 
30 same fiscal period. The department's rules must provide that, beginning in the state fiscal 
31 year beginning July 1, 2026, the MaineCare reimbursement rates set for each rebasing year 
32 must include an inflation adjustment for a cost-of-living percentage change in in-home and 
33 community support services reimbursement each year in accordance with the United States 
34 Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index medical care 
35 services index.  Any rebasing done pursuant to this subsection may not result in an in-home 
36 and community support services provider receiving a MaineCare reimbursement rate that 
37 is lower than the rate in effect on June 30, 2026.
38Sec. A-2.  22 MRSA c. 1627 is enacted to read:
