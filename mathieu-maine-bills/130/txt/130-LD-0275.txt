Page 1 - 130LR0576(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, a regulatory change in certification requirements for educational 
4 technicians has made some educational technicians for the first time mandatory members 
5 of the State Employee and Teacher Retirement Program; and
6Whereas, the affected positions had been covered by the United States Social Security 
7 Act or other retirement programs; and
8Whereas, it was not the intent of the Legislature or the State Board of Education to 
9 change retirement benefit coverage for the affected positions; and
10Whereas, correcting this unintended consequence immediately is necessary to 
11 prevent harm to employees in these positions who would benefit from continuing to be 
12 covered by the United States Social Security Act or other retirement programs; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore,
17Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §17001, sub-§42, ¶A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 460, §1, is 
19 further amended to read:
20 A.  Any employee of a public school or a school management and leadership center 
21 established pursuant to Title 20‑A, chapter 123 who fills any position that the 
22 Department of Education requires be filled by a person who holds the appropriate 
23 certification or license required for that position, other than an educational technician 
24 position for which certification is not required under Title 20-A, section 13019-H, and:
25 (1)  Holds appropriate certification from the Department of Education, including 
26 an employee whose duties include, in addition to those for which certification is 
27 required, either the setup, maintenance or upgrading of a school computer system 
28 the use of which is to assist in the introduction of new learning to students or 
29 providing school faculty orientation and training related to use of the computer 
30 system for educational purposes; or
31 (2)  Holds an appropriate license issued to a professional employee by a licensing 
32 agency of the State;
33Sec. 2.  Retroactivity.  This Act applies retroactively to July 1, 2018.
34Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
35 takes effect when approved.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill provides an exception to mandatory membership in the State Employee and 
38 Teacher Retirement Program for employees filling certain educational technician positions 
39 who do not introduce new learning plans and supervise small groups of students in 
40 community-based programs and are therefore not required by statute to be certified.
