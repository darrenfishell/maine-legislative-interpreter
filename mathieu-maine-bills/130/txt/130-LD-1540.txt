27 available another commercial food scraps disposal service that meets the requirements 
28 of this subsection; and
29 C.  If the commercial entity offers a drop-off service at a fixed location to collect 
30 municipal solid waste, offer at the fixed location the collection of food scraps. 
315. Municipal solid waste management.  A commercial entity engaged in the transport

34 scraps in a manner consistent with section 2101-B, subsection 1 and the ordinance:
35 A. Is applicable to all residents of the municipality; and
36 B. Prohibits a resident from opting out of municipally provided solid waste 
37 management services.
386. Public collection containers for food scraps.  Beginning January 1, 2025, if a 
39 container in a public building or on public land is provided for the public to use for solid 
40 waste destined for disposal, a container for the collection of food scraps must be provided 
41 that is clearly labeled as a container for food scraps and be placed as close as possible to 
Page 5 - 130LR1411(01)42 the container for the disposal of solid waste and provide equally convenient access to 
43 members of the public.
37. Rules. The department shall adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section.  
4 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
5 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
6SUMMARY
7 This bill sets goals for the reduction of the disposal of food scraps and for food rescue, 
8 which is collecting edible food that would otherwise become solid waste and distributing 
9 the food to a hunger relief organization, food bank or pantry or other recipient to be used 
10 for human consumption.  The bill sets priorities for the management of food scraps, with 
11 reduction at the point of generation being the first priority, then diversion for food 
12 consumption by humans, then diversion for agricultural use, including for consumption by 
13 animals, then subjecting the food scraps to composting or anaerobic digestion with 
14 subsequent soil application and finally subjecting the food scraps to anaerobic digestion 
15 not followed by soil application.  Requirements are placed on producers of food scraps to 
16 separate the food scraps from other solid waste at the point of generation, with these 
17 requirements phased in over a 5-year period, beginning with the larger producers of food 
18 scraps.  Commercial entities engaged in the transportation of municipal solid waste are 
19 required to collect food scraps from customers except for customers in municipalities with 
20 solid waste management ordinances that cover the collection of food scraps and that are 
21 consistent with the State's food recovery policy.  The bill requires clearly marked food 
22 scraps containers to be placed next to any solid waste containers provided in public 
23 buildings and on public land.1
