Page 1 - 130LR0046(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  10 MRSA ยง1489, as enacted by PL 1987, c. 574, is amended to read:
3ยง1489.  Exemption
4 Parties to a home construction contract may exempt themselves from the requirements 
5 of this chapter only if the contractor specifically informs the homeowner or lessee of his 
6 the homeowner's or lessee's rights under this chapter and the parties then mutually agree to 
7 a contract or change order that does not contain the parts set forth in sections 1487 and 
8 1488.
9 Parties to a home construction contract may exempt themselves from the initial down 
10 payment limitations set forth in section 1487, subsection 5 only if the following conditions have 
11 been met:
121.  Limit on amount of initial down payment.  The contractor informs the homeowner 
13 or lessee of the homeowner's or lessee's right under section 1487, subsection 5 to pay no 
14 more than 1/3 of the contract price in an initial down payment;
152.  Waiver of rights.  The homeowner or lessee agrees, in a writing signed by both the 
16 homeowner or lessee and the contractor on a separate page, included in the contract, to 
17 waive the homeowner's or lessee's rights under section 1487, subsection 5; and
183.  Amount due clearly stated.  The signed document under subsection 2 clearly states 
19 the amount due as an initial down payment.
20SUMMARY
21 This bill clarifies the requirement that a contractor obtain informed consent from a 
22 homeowner or lessee in the event the initial down payment for a construction project is 
23 more than 1/3 of the total contract price.  The bill requires a contractor to set forth a waiver 
24 from the requirement that an initial down payment not exceed 1/3 of the total contract price 
25 in writing, on a separate page included in the contract, signed by both the homeowner or 
26 lessee and the contractor.  The bill also requires that the waiver document clearly state the 
27 initial down payment amount due.
