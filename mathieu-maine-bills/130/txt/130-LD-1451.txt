Page 1 - 130LR0825(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §1001, sub-§8-A, ¶D is enacted to read:
3 D.  The school board shall incorporate into the due process standards under this 
4 subsection policies adopted under subsection 15-A or, if no policies have been adopted, 
5 standards consistent with the criteria listed under subsection 15-A, and these policies 
6 or standards must be complied with before the school board may issue a written 
7 decision to expel a student, including an expulsion under subsection 9 or subsection 
8 9-A.
9SUMMARY
10 This bill requires that a school board incorporate disciplinary policies into its due 
11 process standards for determining whether to expel a student.  A school board is required 
12 to consider the following:
13 1.  Focusing on positive interventions and expectations and avoiding focusing 
14 exclusively on unacceptable student behavior;
15 2.  Focusing on positive and restorative interventions that are consistent with evidence-
16 based practices rather than set punishments for specific behavior and avoiding so-called 
17 zero-tolerance practices unless specifically required by federal or state laws, rules or 
18 regulations;
19 3.  Allowing administrators to use their discretion to fashion appropriate discipline that 
20 examines the circumstances pertinent to the case at hand; and
21 4.  Providing written notice to the parents of a student when the student is suspended 
22 from school, regardless of whether the suspension is an in-school or out-of-school 
23 suspension.10
