17SUMMARY
18 This bill amends the law that requires health insurance carriers to cover telehealth 
19 services to provide that health care services provided through telephone communication 
20 are considered telehealth services, thus requiring a carrier to cover health care services 
21 provided through telephone communication regardless of whether or not other telehealth 
22 services are available.  It also allows patients receiving MaineCare health services to 
23 provide verbal, electronic or written consent to telehealth and telemonitoring services.
