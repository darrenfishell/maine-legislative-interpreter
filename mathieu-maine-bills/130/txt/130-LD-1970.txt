33 recommendations resulting from a review by multiple agencies of their respective laws and 
34 rules to determine changes necessary to incorporate into those laws and rules sea level rise 
35 projections and measures designed to enhance community resilience to flooding and other 
36 climate impacts.
37 Part A of the bill implements the recommendations of the Department of Agriculture, 
38 Conservation and Forestry.  It amends the requirements of the Maine Land Use Planning 
39 Commission permit exception for the repair and maintenance or replacement of existing 
40 road culverts to incorporate similar requirements for such activities imposed under the 
41 Natural Resources Protection Act.  It amends the laws governing municipal planning and

45 climate risks identified in such assessments; and to require that the department's technical 
46 and financial assistance program for the implementation of growth management programs 
47 provide priority in the making of grants under the technical and financial assistance 
48 program to municipalities and multimunicipal regions that have adopted local climate 
49 action plans and prepared climate vulnerability assessments.  
7 Part B of the bill implements the recommendations of the Department of 
8 Environmental Protection.  It amends the site location of development laws to authorize 
9 the department to consider the effects of sea level rise in determining whether a developer 
10 has made adequate provision for fitting a proposed development harmoniously into the 
11 existing natural environment.  It amends solid waste facility siting laws to authorize the 
12 department to consider the effects of sea level rise in determining whether an applicant for 
13 a solid waste facility license has made adequate provision for fitting a proposed facility 
14 harmoniously into the existing natural environment.  
15 The committee has not taken a position on the substance of the bill and by reporting 
16 this bill out, the committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees
