3 A licensee may not employ a person under 21 years of age.
41. Verification.  The department may verify a person's age in accordance with this 
5 section.  During an inspection in accordance with this chapter, the department may require 
6 proof that a person performing work at the premises is 21 years of age or older.  If the 
7 person does not provide the department with acceptable proof of age upon request, the 
8 department may require the person to immediately cease any activity and leave the 
9 premises until the department receives acceptable proof of age.  The department may 
10 request that the licensee provide proof that the person is 21 years of age or older.  Failure 
11 of the licensee to respond to the request is prima facie evidence that the licensee has allowed 
12 the person to perform work at the premises for which a license has been issued, except that 
13 it is an affirmative defense that the person is only temporarily at the premises to make a 
14 service, maintenance or repair call or for other purposes and is not an employee of the 
15 licensee.
16 A person who violates this section commits a Class E crime. 
17§2012. Publication of information related to the use of psilocybin
18 The department shall publish on a publicly accessible website available medical, 
19 psychological and scientific studies, research and other information, including but not 
20 limited to information submitted to the department by the board, relating to the safety and 
21 efficacy of psilocybin in treating mental health conditions, including but not limited to 
22 substance use disorder, depression, anxiety disorders and end-of-life psychological 
23 distress.
24§2013. Investigation by a criminal justice agency of unlawful activity
25 A criminal justice agency may investigate unlawful activity under this chapter and may 
26 conduct a criminal history record check of a licensee or its employees during an 
27 investigation of unlawful activity in relation to a licensee.  A law enforcement officer may 
28 enforce any provision of this chapter and may assist the department in enforcing this 
29 chapter.
30 A law enforcement officer who has notice, knowledge or reasonable suspicion of a 
31 violation of this chapter shall immediately notify the district attorney who has jurisdiction 
32 over the violation and furnish that district attorney with names and addresses of any 
33 witnesses to the violation or other information related to the violation.
34§2014. Cooperation of other state entities; immunity
35 All state agencies, including but not limited to the Department of Administrative and

38 chapter.  The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry may possess, test and 
39 dispose of psilocybin products on behalf of the department.
40 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the State, its agencies and 
41 employees are immune from any liability arising out of the performance or nonperformance 
42 of any duty or function, or the exercise of any power, under this chapter or any other law 
43 of this State relating to psilocybin products.

6 any rules adopted in accordance with this chapter.
7§2016. Immunity; refusal to serve; insurance
81.  Reliance immunity.  A licensee or licensee representative may reasonably rely 
9 upon all statements, declarations and representations made by a client on a client 
10 information form unless a reasonable person would have reason to believe a statement, 
11 declaration or representation on the form was incorrect or altered.  A licensee or licensee 
12 representative who in good faith reasonably relies on statements, declarations and 
13 representations made by a client on a client information form in accordance with this 
14 subsection may not be found in violation of this chapter for selling or serving a psilocybin 
15 product to that person based on those statements, declarations and representations.  Nothing 
16 in this subsection creates any immunity for a licensee or licensee representative who has 
17 otherwise violated this chapter or rule adopted pursuant to this chapter.
182.  Refusal to serve.  Nothing in this chapter requires a licensee or licensee 
19 representative to provide psilocybin services to any person.  Except as provided in this 
20 section, a licensee or licensee representative may refuse to provide psilocybin services to 
21 any person or may cease providing such services to a client for any reason or for no reason.  
22 A licensee or licensee representative may not cease providing psilocybin services during 
23 an administration session after the client has consumed a psilocybin product except as 
24 authorized by the department by rule or as necessary in an emergency.
253. Insurance.  The department may by rule require licensees to maintain general 
26 liability insurance in an amount the department determines is reasonably affordable and 
27 available for the purpose of protecting licensees against damages resulting from causes of 
28 action related to activities undertaken pursuant to this chapter.
294.  Discrimination.  A licensee may not discharge, demote, suspend or in any manner 
30 discriminate or retaliate against an employee of the licensee with regard to promotion, 
31 compensation or other terms, conditions or privileges of employment on the basis that the 
32 employee has in good faith reported information to the department about an action or 
33 inaction of the licensee that the employee reasonably believes is a violation of this chapter 
34 or any rules adopted pursuant to this chapter. 
35§2017.  Enforceability of contracts
36 A contract involving psilocybin products is not unenforceable on the basis that 
37 manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, possessing or using psilocybin products is 
38 prohibited by federal law.
39§2018. Department hotline for verification of license
401. Contact.  The department shall maintain a telephone hotline for the following 
41 persons to inquire if an address is the location of a licensee's premises or is the location of

10 at that election. 
11 B.  If a governing body adopts a measure establishing a prohibition under this 
12 subsection and the measure is approved in accordance with paragraph A, the governing 
13 body must provide the text of the measure to the department.  Upon receiving notice 
14 of the prohibition, the department shall discontinue licensing any premises to which 
15 the prohibition applies.
