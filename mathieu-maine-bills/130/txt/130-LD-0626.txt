Page 1 - 130LR0450(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §13072, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 492, §3, is amended 
3 to read:
45.  Mooring sites.  The regulation of moorings in inland waters is governed by Title 
5 38, except that Title 38 may not be construed to require the municipal officers of a town 
6 that does not border or contain territorial waters to appoint a harbor master upon the request 
7 of a person desiring mooring privileges or the regulation of mooring privileges.  If the 
8 municipal officers of a town that borders on or contains inland waters do not appoint a 
9 harbor master, they shall designate an individual or entity who is responsible for dealing 
10 with inquiries related to mooring privileges or the regulation of mooring privileges. This 
11 individual or entity shall coordinate with appropriate law enforcement agencies about 
12 issues related to the regulation of moorings under Title 38 or as otherwise provided in law.  
13 Nothing in this subsection limits or expands a municipality's authority to regulate moorings 
14 under Title 38 or as otherwise provided in law.
15Sec. 2.  12 MRSA §13072, sub-§6 is enacted to read:
166.  Model ordinance.  The department shall develop and periodically update a model 
17 ordinance regarding moorings in inland waters for use by municipalities or other governing 
18 entities.  The department shall make the model ordinance available on its publicly 
19 accessible website.  The model ordinance must define "temporary mooring."  In 
20 development of the model ordinance, the department shall, at a minimum, consult with the 
21 Maine Municipal Association and a representative of county commissioners.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill requires municipalities that border or contain inland waters to have a 
24 designated individual or entity responsible for dealing with inquiries related to mooring 
25 privileges.  It also directs the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to develop model 
26 ordinance language to support municipalities or other governing entities that choose to 
27 regulate moorings.23
