This amendment adds an implementation date of January 1, 2023 for the changed definition of "waste generated 
within the State". Delaying the start date will restore half of the Other Special Revenue Funds revenue loss reflected 
in Committee "A1' in fiscal year 2022-23 and the allocation for that amount is restored as well. As amended, the bill 
will still reduce Other Special Revenue Funds by $187,500 in fiscal year 2022-23 and continue to reduce by $375,000 
in subsequent years.
