Page 1 - 130LR0591(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease referred to as COVID-19 has 
4 created a public health emergency; and
5Whereas, in response to the public health emergency, the Governor has issued 
6 executive orders limiting the ability of restaurants and other businesses to sell liquor for 
7 on-premises consumption; and
8Whereas, the limitation on selling liquor for on-premises consumption has led to 
9 decreased revenue for those businesses and a corresponding decreased ability to timely pay 
10 license renewal fees; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  One-time waiver of fee for license renewal.  Notwithstanding any 
17 provision of law to the contrary, an applicant for renewal of an on-premises retail license

20 required to pay a license renewal fee for that license in 2021.

22 takes effect when approved.
