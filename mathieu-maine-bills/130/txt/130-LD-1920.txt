24 increased access to professional counseling services;
257.  Licensure requirements.  Support the uniformity of professional counseling 
26 licensure requirements throughout the states to promote public safety and public health 
27 benefits;
288.  State authority.  Invest all member states with the authority to hold a licensed 
29 professional counselor accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which 
30 the client is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of member 
31 state licenses;
329.  Multiple licenses.  Eliminate the necessity for licenses in multiple states; and

Page 8 - 130LR2233(01)1 A.  Take adverse action against a licensed professional counselor's privilege to practice 
2 within that member state; and
3 B.  Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and 
4 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence.  Subpoenas issued by a 
5 licensing board in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the 
6 production of evidence from another member state must be enforced in the latter state 
7 by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that 
8 court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it.  The issuing 
9 authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required

11 Only the home state has the power to take adverse action against a licensed professional 
12 counselor's license issued by the home state.
132.  Conduct; appropriate action.  For purposes of taking adverse action, the home 
14 state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a member 
15 state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state.  In so doing, the home 
16 state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
173.  Change of residence.  The home state shall complete any pending investigations 
18 of a licensed professional counselor who changes the primary state of residence during the 
19 course of the investigations.  The home state also has the authority to take appropriate 
20 action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator 
21 of the data system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall 
22 promptly notify the new home state of any adverse actions.
234.  Recovery.  A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from 
24 the affected licensed professional counselor the costs of investigations and dispositions of 
25 cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensed professional counselor.
265.  Remote state findings.  A member state may take adverse action based on the 
27 factual findings of the remote state as long as the member state follows its own procedures 
28 for taking the adverse action.
296.  Joint investigations.  In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its 
30 respective professional counseling practice act or other applicable state law, any member 
31 state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees.
32 Member states shall share any investigative, litigation or compliance materials in 
33 furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact.
347.  Deactivation.  If adverse action is taken by the home state against the license of a 
35 licensed professional counselor, the licensed professional counselor's privilege to practice 
36 in all other member states must be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed 
37 from the state license.  All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against 
38 the license of a licensed professional counselor must include a statement that the licensed 
39 professional counselor's privilege to practice is deactivated in all member states during the 
40 pendency of the order.
418.  Notification.  If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the 
42 administrator of the data system.  The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify 
43 the home state of any adverse actions by remote states.

49 intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
7 B.  The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee or

10 commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the person against whom 
11 the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of 
12 commission employment, duties or responsibilities, except that nothing in this 
13 paragraph may be construed to prohibit that person from retaining that person's own

11§18562.  Rulemaking
121.  Promulgation.  The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to 
13 effectively and efficiently achieve the purpose of the compact.  Notwithstanding the 
14 foregoing, in the event the commission exercises its rule-making authority in a manner that 
15 is beyond the scope of the purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then 
16 such an action by the commission is invalid and has no force or effect.
172.  Powers.  The commission shall exercise its rule-making powers pursuant to the 
18 criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules and amendments 
19 become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.

21 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 
22 4 years of the date of adoption of the rule, then that rule has no further force and effect in 
23 any member state.
244.  Rule adoption procedure.  Rules or amendments to the rules must be adopted at a 
25 regular or special meeting of the commission.
265.  Notice.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the 
27 commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be 
28 considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:
29 A.  On the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform; and
30 B.  On the website of each member state professional counseling licensing board or

12 access to the electronic hearing.
13 A.  All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing must notify the executive director of 
14 the commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and 
15 testify at the hearing not less than 5 business days before the scheduled date of the 
16 hearing.
17 B.  Hearings must be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to 
18 comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.
19 C.  All hearings must be recorded.  A copy of the recording must be made available on 
20 request.
21 D.  Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each 
22 rule.  Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required 
23 by this section.
2410.  Consideration.  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business 
25 on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider 
26 all written and oral comments received.
2711.  Proceeding without public hearing.  If no written notice of intent to attend the 
28 public hearing by interested parties is received, the commission may proceed with 
29 promulgation of the proposed rule without a public hearing.
3012.  Final action.  The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final 
31 action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based 
32 on the rule-making record and the full text of the rule.
3313.  Emergency rulemaking.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 
34 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity 
35 for comment or hearing, as long as the usual rule-making procedures provided in the 
36 compact and in this section are retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably 
37 possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes 
38 of this subsection, "emergency rule" means a rule that must be adopted immediately in

7 notice of any revisions must be posted on the website of the commission.  The revision is 
8 subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.  The revision may 
9 be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.  A 
10 challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the 
11 end of the notice period.  If no challenge is made, the revision takes effect without further 
12 action.  If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval 
13 of the commission.
14§18563.  Oversight, dispute resolution and enforcement
151.  Oversight.  Oversight of the compact is governed by this subsection. 
16 A.  The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government in each 
17 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate 
18 to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.  The provisions of this compact and 
19 the rules promulgated hereunder have standing as statutory law.
20 B.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or 
21 administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this 
22 compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the commission.
23 C.  The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding under 
24 paragraph B and has standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  
25 Failure to provide service of process to the commission renders a judgment or order 
26 void as to the commission, this compact or promulgated rules.
272.  Default and technical assistance.  Default and technical assistance are governed 
28 by this subsection. 
29 A.  If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance 
30 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the 
31 commission shall:
32 (1)  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the 
33 nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any other action 
34 to be taken by the commission; and
35 (2)  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the 
36 default.
373.  Termination from compact.  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the 
38 defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority 
39 of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may 
40 be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve 
41 the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
Page 17 - 130LR2233(01)14.  Termination regulation.  Termination of membership in the compact may be 
2 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice 
3 of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the commission to the governor, the 
4 majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and each of the member 
5 states.
65.  Responsibilities after termination.  A state that has been terminated is responsible 
7 for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of 
8 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.
96.  Costs.  The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be 
10 in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing 
11 between the commission and the defaulting state.
127.  Appeal.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by 
13 petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal 
14 district where the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member must be 
15 awarded all costs of that litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
168.  Dispute resolution.  Dispute resolution is governed by this subsection. 
17 A.  Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes 
18 related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and 
19 nonmember states.
20 B.  The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding 
21 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
229.  Enforcement.  Enforcement of the compact is governed by this subsection. 
23 A.  The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the 
24 provisions and rules of this compact.
25 B.  By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States 
26 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission 
27 has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with 
28 the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought 
29 may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is 
30 necessary, the prevailing member must be awarded all costs of that litigation, including 
31 reasonable attorney's fees.
32 C.  The remedies under this subsection are not the exclusive remedies of the 
33 commission.  The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal 
34 or state law.
35§18564.  Date of implementation of counseling compact; commission and associated 
36rules, withdrawal and amendment
371.  Effective date.  The compact takes effect on the date on which the compact statute 
38 is enacted into law in the 10th member state.  The provisions of the compact that become 
39 effective at that time are limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to 
40 assembly and the promulgation of rules.  After the effective date of the compact, the 
41 commission shall meet and exercise rule-making powers necessary to the implementation 
42 and administration of the compact.
Page 18 - 130LR2233(01)12.  Subsequent member states.  Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the 
2 commission's initial adoption of the rules is subject to the rules as they exist on the date on 
3 which the compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted 
4 by the commission has the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law 
5 in that state.
63.  Withdrawal.  Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a 
7 statute repealing the same.
8 A.  A member state's withdrawal does not take effect until 6 months after enactment of 
9 the repealing statute.
10 B.  Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's 
11 professional counseling licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse 
12 action reporting requirements of this chapter prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
134.  Other agreements or arrangements.  Nothing contained in this compact may be 
14 construed to invalidate or prevent any professional counseling licensure agreement or other 
15 cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not 
16 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
175.  Amendment.  This compact may be amended by the member states.  An amendment 
18 to this compact does not become effective and binding upon any member state until it is 
19 enacted into the laws of all member states.
20§18565.  Construction and severability
21 This compact may be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The 
22 provisions of this compact must be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or 
23 provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state 
24 or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 
25 circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the 
26 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is not affected 
27 thereby.  If this compact is held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the 
28 compact remains in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force 
29 and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
30§18566.  Binding effect of compact and other laws
311.  Adherence.  A licensee providing professional counseling services in a remote state 
32 under the privilege to practice shall adhere to the laws and regulations, including scope of 
33 practice, of the remote state.
342.  Enforcement.  Nothing in this chapter prevents the enforcement of any other law 
35 of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
363.  Conflict.  Any laws in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded 
37 to the extent of the conflict.
384.  Binding actions.  Any lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and 
39 bylaws properly promulgated by the commission, are binding upon the member states.
405.  Binding agreements.  All permissible agreements between the commission and the 
41 member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
Page 19 - 130LR2233(01)16.  Constitutional limits.  In the event any provision of the compact exceeds the 
2 constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, the provision is 
3 ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that 
4 member state.
