Page 1 - 130LR0197(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA §2128-B, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 601, §11, is amended 
3 to read:
41.  Filing deadline for direct impediment.  A Except as provided in subsection 1-A, 
5 a one-year period of limitation applies to initiating a petition for post-conviction review 
6 seeking relief from a criminal judgment under section 2124, subsection 1 or 1-A.  The 
7 limitation period runs from the latest later of the following:
8 A.  The date of final disposition of the direct appeal from the underlying criminal 
9 judgment or the expiration of the time for seeking the appeal; and
10 B.  The date on which the constitutional right, state or federal, asserted was initially 
11 recognized by the Law Court or the Supreme Court of the United States if the right has 
12 been newly recognized by that highest court and made retroactively applicable to cases 
13 on collateral review; or .
14 C.  The date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have 
15 been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
16 The time during which a properly filed petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court 
17 of the United States with respect to the same criminal judgment is pending is not counted 
18 toward any period of limitation under this subsection.
19Sec. 2.  15 MRSA §2128-B, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:
201-A.  No filing deadline for direct impediment if newly discovered evidence.  If the 
21 factual predicate of a claim is based on newly discovered evidence, then the claim may be 
22 filed at any time regardless of when the newly discovered evidence could have been 
23 obtained or discovered through the exercise of due diligence.  The court may require the 
24 petitioner to provide additional information about the nature of the newly discovered 
25 evidence.  The fact that a petition initiated pursuant to subsection 1, former paragraph C 
26 was dismissed as untimely filed or for the failure to exercise due diligence does not 
27 preclude the initiation of a petition for review under this subsection based on the same or 
28 different newly discovered evidence. 
29SUMMARY
30 This bill provides that there is no deadline for filing a petition for post-conviction 
31 review based on newly discovered evidence.  The court may require the petitioner to 
32 provide additional information about the nature of the newly discovered evidence.  
33 This bill ensures that a person may seek post-conviction review on the basis of newly 
34 discovered evidence even if the person had filed for review and the petition was dismissed 
35 because it was untimely filed or because the evidence was not discovered earlier because 
36 of the lack of due diligence.
