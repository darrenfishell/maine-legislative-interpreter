Page 1 - 130LR1454(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §1819, 2nd ¶, as amended by PL 2013, c. 1, Pt. J, §1 and c. 405, 
3 Pt. A, §24, is further amended to read:
4 Unless otherwise provided by law, and after payment of any existing lease for Crescent 
5 Beach State Park, all user fees derived from use of state parks, historic sites and the 
6 Allagash Wilderness Waterway and other payments for services received under this section 
7 must accrue to the General Fund, except that all revenues resulting from an increase in fees 
8 after July 1, 1990 in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway accrue to a dedicated revenue 
9 account to be used for capital improvements in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway.  All 
10 revenue in excess of $4,500,000, after all other adjustments have been made, accrues to a 
11 nonlapsing dedicated revenue account to be used for capital improvements at state parks 
12 and historic sites; this account may also be used to match federal allocations from the land 
13 and water conservation fund established pursuant to the federal Land and Water 
14 Conservation Fund Act of 1965.  When fees may be more efficiently collected through 3rd-
15 party contracts, a percentage of the fee may be retained by the contractor for services as 
16 agreed upon by the bureau.
17SUMMARY
18 This bill requires all revenue in excess of $4,500,000 from user fees from state parks, 
19 historic sites and the Allagash Wilderness Waterway and other payments for certain 
20 services, after all other adjustments have been made, to accrue to a nonlapsing dedicated 
21 revenue account to be used for capital improvements at state parks and historic sites; this 
22 account may also be used to match federal allocations.18
