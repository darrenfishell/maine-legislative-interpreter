2 percentage of combined spending on primary care and behavioral health care based 
3 on claims data reported for plan year 2019 and report that percentage to the 
4 Superintendent of Insurance by January 1, 2022.  The superintendent shall establish 
5 the median percentage for all health insurance carriers for plan year 2023.  In

8 is based on claims data reported for calendar year 2024 and plan year 2026 is based 
9 on claims data reported for calendar year 2025.
10 (2)  Beginning in plan year 2023 and through plan year 2026, if the group health 
11 plan spends less than or equal to the median described in subparagraph (1) on 
12 primary care and behavioral health care, the group health plan shall increase its 
13 percentage spent on primary care and behavioral health care combined by at least 
14 2% the following plan year over the plan year referenced in subparagraph (1) plus 
15 an increase equal to the rate of increase each year in the Consumer Price Index for 
16 medical care services as reported by the United States Department of Labor,

29 on the group health plan's updated percentage spent on primary care and behavioral 
30 health care combined.
31 (5)  The group health plan may demonstrate that the targets required by this 
32 subsection are met by averaging its increases in spending on primary care and 
33 behavioral health care combined over more than one plan year as long as the total 
34 increases required pursuant to this subsection through plan year 2026 are met each 
35 year.
36 (6)  For plan year 2027 and each plan year thereafter, the group health plan shall 
37 maintain, at a minimum, the total combined spending on primary care and 
38 behavioral health care required pursuant to this section for plan year 2026.

41 spending on primary care and behavioral health care based on claims data reported for 
42 plan year 2019 and report that percentage to the superintendent.  The superintendent 
43 shall establish the median percentage for all carriers for plan year 2023.  In subsequent 
Page 6 - 130LR0740(01)44 plan years, the superintendent shall recalculate the median so that plan year 2024 is

46 data reported for calendar year 2024 and plan year 2026 is based on claims data 
47 reported for calendar year 2025.
5 B.  Beginning in plan year 2023 and through plan year 2026, if a carrier spends less 
6 than or equal to the median described in paragraph A on primary care and behavioral 
7 health care, the carrier shall increase its percentage spent on primary care and 
8 behavioral health care combined by at least 2% the following plan year over the plan 
9 year referenced in paragraph A plus an increase equal to the rate of increase each year

12 C.  Beginning in plan year 2023 and through plan year 2026, if the carrier spends at or 
13 above the median described in paragraph A on primary care and behavioral health care, 
14 the carrier shall increase its percentage spent on primary care and behavioral health 
15 care combined by at least 1% the following plan year over the plan year referenced in

23 E.  A carrier may demonstrate that the targets required by the subsection are met by

26 to this subsection through plan year 2026 are met.
27 F.  For plan year 2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, the carrier shall maintain, at a 
28 minimum, the total combined spending on primary care and behavioral health care

343.  Rate approval.  Beginning in plan year 2023, the superintendent may not approve 
35 any rate filed by a carrier unless the carrier demonstrates that the targets required by this 
36 section have been met.  The superintendent may approve rates provisionally for one year, 
37 if the superintendent is satisfied with an action plan submitted by a carrier to meet the 
38 targets described in this section.  As part of any rate filing, the superintendent may require 
39 a carrier to provide such additional information as necessary to determine compliance with 
40 this section.
41SUMMARY
42 This bill requires health carriers to meet certain targets for investment and spending in 
43 primary care and behavioral health care beginning in plan year 2023 and through plan year 1

Page 7 - 130LR0740(01)44 2026.  Overall spending may not increase to meet the targets. The bill establishes a 
45 benchmark for combined spending in primary care and behavioral health care as a 
46 percentage of overall health spending.  The benchmark is indexed to the median amount 
47 spent by carriers on primary care and behavioral health care for plan year 2019.  The bill 
48 requires carriers to increase relative spending in these areas by at least 2% per year if 
49 spending is less than or equal to the median and at least 1% per year if spending is above 
50 the median.  Beginning in plan year 2027, carriers are required to maintain, at a minimum, 
51 the total combined spending on primary care and behavioral health care achieved in plan 
52 year 2026.  The bill prohibits the Superintendent of Insurance from approving health 
53 insurance rates filed by a carrier unless the carrier demonstrates that the targets have been 
54 met.  The bill also authorizes a carrier to meet the spending targets by supplemental 
55 payments focused on primary care and behavioral health care.
13 The bill also requires the MaineCare program and the state employee health plan to 
14 meet the same targets beginning in 2023.1
