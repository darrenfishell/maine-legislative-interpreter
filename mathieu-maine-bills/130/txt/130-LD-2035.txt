29 clarifies that certain documentation and fee waivers may be authorized only in situations 
30 of extreme and demonstrated hardship and only for individuals educated or trained in 
31 jurisdictions outside the United States.  The bill also allows a licensing entity the 
32 opportunity to issue licenses by endorsement prior to the conclusion of the rule-making 
33 process.
34 In addition, the bill adds language to the powers of the Department of Professional and 
35 Financial Regulation, Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation and to certain 
36 licensing entities within the office to clarify that the licensing entities are required to 
37 establish a process for licensure by endorsement despite any conflicting statutory language. 
38 This bill clarifies that an applicant to the licensing entities within the office may apply 
39 under the application process of the applicant's choice.28
