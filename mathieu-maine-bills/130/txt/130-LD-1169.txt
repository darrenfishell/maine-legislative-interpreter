Page 1 - 130LR0821(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §13012-B is enacted to read:
3§13012-B.  Emergency educator certificate
4 Upon the identification of an educator staffing shortage in the State, the commissioner 
5 may issue emergency certificates to teachers, specialists and administrators in accordance 
6 with this section.  The commissioner shall issue an emergency certificate to an applicant 
7 who meets the requirements of this section.  The commissioner shall provide to an applicant 
8 who is not qualified information regarding any remaining requirements and other 
9 certification options available to the applicant.  The commissioner may issue an emergency 
10 certificate under this section only to address the identified staffing shortage and only in a 
11 manner that ensures that the person issued an emergency certificate does not supplant an 
12 otherwise qualified and available teacher, specialist or administrator.
131. Emergency teacher certificate.  The commissioner may issue an emergency 
14 teacher certificate under this section to an applicant who has submitted to a criminal history 
15 background check and who:
16 A. Holds a 4-year postsecondary degree or the equivalent in work or academic 
17 experience;
18 B. Is enrolled in an approved teacher preparation program; or
19 C. Holds a certification as an education technician III issued according to rules of the 
20 department pursuant to section 13019-H.
21 A teacher holding an emergency teacher certificate shall participate in a mentoring program 
22 provided by the department or a school administrative unit. A certificate issued pursuant to 
23 this subsection is issued for a one-year period and no more than 3 emergency certificates 
24 may be issued per applicant.
252. Educator and administrator certification reciprocity.  The commissioner may 
26 issue a reciprocal emergency certificate pursuant to this section to a teacher, specialist or 
27 administrator who has submitted to a criminal history background check and holds a 
28 comparable certificate in another state or country.  A certificate issued pursuant to this 
29 subsection is issued for a 5-year period.
30SUMMARY
31 Pursuant to Governor Mills’ Executive Order #7 in fiscal year 2020-21, the 
32 Commissioner of Education was authorized to issue emergency certification to teachers, 
33 specialists and administrators who meet certain criteria, so long as the applicants are 
34 employed only as necessary to meet identified staffing shortages and supplement, rather 
35 than supplant, otherwise qualified applicants who meet regular certification standards.  This 
36 bill makes that authority of the Commissioner of Education permanent.31
