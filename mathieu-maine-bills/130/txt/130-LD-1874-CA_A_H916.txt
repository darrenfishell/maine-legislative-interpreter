Current biennium cost increase -Local school administrative units 
Amending the provisions of Public Law 2021, chapter 378, "An Act To Retroactively Grant Sick Leave Days to 
Public School Employees Affected by COVID-1911 to 1) require school administrative units (SA Us) grant up to 15 
days of "COVID-19 related" paid leave to public school employees with less than 60 accrued days of paid leave 
affected by the illness caused by COVID-19 to be used when needed by the employee; 2) restore "regular" sick leave 
days used to certain employees; and 3) compensate other employees that had COVID-19 related absences but were not 
eligible to be paid for those absences may result in increased costs to local school administrative units if the SAU pays 
more in total paid leave benefits and substitute teacher costs than it would have absent these changes. The impact on 
individual SAU's will depend on actual experience. To the extent that federal funds may be used to pay for the 
additional costs, the impact to SAU's may be mitigated.
