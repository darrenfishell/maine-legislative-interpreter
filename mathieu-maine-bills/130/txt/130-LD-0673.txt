202.  Insulin Safety Net Program established.  The board shall establish the Insulin 
21 Safety Net Program, referred to in this section as "the program," in accordance with the 
22 requirements of this section.  Under the program, by January 1, 2022, each manufacturer 
23 shall establish procedures to make insulin available in accordance with this section and as 
24 required under subsections 3 and 4 to pharmacies for dispensing to eligible individuals who 
25 are in urgent need of insulin or who need access to an affordable insulin supply.
263.  Urgent need safety net.  The board shall, through the program, authorize a 
27 pharmacy to dispense a 30-day supply of insulin to an eligible individual in urgent need of 
28 insulin in accordance with this subsection.
29 A.  To be eligible, an individual must demonstrate on an application form developed 
30 by the board that the individual:
31 (1)  Is a resident of this State;
32 (2)  Is not enrolled in MaineCare or any other health coverage or prescription drug 
33 coverage that limits the total amount of cost-sharing that the enrollee is required to

13 regardless of the type or amount of insulin needed.
14 Notwithstanding the requirement in this paragraph, an individual who is enrolled in 
15 Medicare Part D is eligible for a manufacturer's patient assistance program if the 
16 individual has spent $1,000 on prescription drugs in the current calendar year and meets 
17 the eligibility requirements in subparagraphs (1) and (2).
18 C.  An individual who is interested in participating in a manufacturer's patient 
19 assistance program may apply directly to the manufacturer or through the individual's 
20 health care practitioner, if the practitioner participates in the manufacturer's patient 
21 assistance program.
22 D.  Upon receipt of an application for the manufacturer's patient assistance program, 
23 the manufacturer shall process the application and determine eligibility.  The 
24 manufacturer shall notify the applicant of the determination within 10 business days of 
25 receipt of the application. If necessary, the manufacturer may request additional 
26 information from the applicant.  If additional information is needed, the manufacturer 
27 shall notify the applicant within 5 business days of receipt of the application as to what 
28 information is being requested.  Within 3 business days of receipt of the requested 
29 information, the manufacturer shall determine eligibility and notify the applicant of the 
30 determination.  If the individual has been determined to be not eligible, the 
31 manufacturer shall include the reasons for denying eligibility in the notification.  The 
32 individual may seek an appeal of the determination in accordance with this section.  If 
33 the individual is determined to be eligible, the manufacturer shall provide the 
34 individual with an eligibility statement or other indication that the individual has been 
35 determined eligible for the manufacturer's patient assistance program.  An individual's 
36 eligibility is valid for 12 months and is renewable upon a redetermination of eligibility.
37 E.  If the eligible individual has prescription drug coverage through an individual or 
38 group health plan, the manufacturer may determine that the individual's insulin needs 
39 are better addressed by providing financial assistance for copayments and other cost-
40 sharing requirements of the individual's individual or group health plan.  The 
41 manufacturer shall establish a copayment assistance program to provide such financial 
42 assistance.  The manufacturer shall inform the individual and provide the individual 
43 with the necessary coupons to submit to a pharmacy.  Under the manufacturer's 
44 copayment assistance program, an eligible individual may not be required to pay more 
45 than a copayment of $35 for a 30-day supply of insulin.
Page 4 - 130LR1953(01)1 F.  The eligible individual shall submit to a pharmacy the eligibility statement provided

8 telephone number, fax number, e-mail address and contact name; and any specific 
9 days or times when deliveries are not accepted by the pharmacy.

12 insulin as ordered, unless a lesser amount is requested in the order, at no charge to 
13 the individual or pharmacy.  Except as authorized under paragraph E, the pharmacy 
14 shall provide the insulin to the individual at no charge to the individual.  The 
15 pharmacy may not provide insulin received from the manufacturer to any 
16 individual other than the individual associated with the specific order.
17 (3)  The pharmacy may not seek reimbursement for the insulin received from the 
18 manufacturer or from any 3rd-party payor.  The pharmacy may collect a copayment 
19 from the individual to cover the pharmacy's costs for processing and dispensing in 
20 an amount not to exceed $50 for each 90-day supply if the insulin is sent to the 
21 pharmacy.
22 (4)  The pharmacy may submit to a manufacturer a reorder for an individual if the 
23 individual's eligibility statement under paragraph D has not expired.  Upon receipt 
24 of a reorder from a pharmacy, the manufacturer shall send to the pharmacy an 
25 additional 90-day supply of the product, unless a lesser amount is requested, at no 
26 charge to the individual or pharmacy if the individual's eligibility statement has not 
27 expired.
28 (5)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (2), a manufacturer may send the insulin as 
29 ordered directly to the individual if the manufacturer provides a mail order service 
30 option.
31 G.  If an individual disagrees with a manufacturer's determination of eligibility under 
32 this subsection, the individual may contact the board to request the use of a 3-person 
33 panel to review eligibility.  The panel is composed of 3 members of the board.  The 
34 individual requesting the review shall submit to the board, with the request, all 
35 documents submitted by the individual to the manufacturer.  The board shall provide 
36 the panel with the documents submitted by the individual. The panel shall render a 
37 decision within 10 business days of receipt of all the necessary documents from the 
38 individual.  The decision of the panel is final.  If the panel determines that the individual 
39 is eligible for the manufacturer's patient assistance program, the manufacturer shall 
40 provide the individual with an eligibility statement in accordance with this subsection.
415.  Additional 30-day urgent-need insulin supply pending eligibility for other 
42coverage or assistance.  If an individual has applied for MaineCare coverage but has not 
43 been determined eligible or has been determined eligible but MaineCare coverage has not 
44 become effective or if the individual has been determined ineligible for the manufacturer's 
45 patient assistance program by the manufacturer and the individual has requested a review 
Page 5 - 130LR1953(01)46 pursuant to subsection 4, paragraph G but the panel has not rendered a decision, the 
47 individual is entitled to access insulin under the provisions of subsection 3 if the individual 
48 has an urgent need of insulin.  To access insulin under this subsection, the individual must

17 subject to enforcement action by the board through any board action authorized in 
18 accordance with section 13731 or any civil penalty or criminal or civil action authorized in 
19 section 13731.
208.  Confidential information.  Any health information or records provided to the board 
21 under this section are confidential if the information or records identify or permit the 
22 identification of an individual who is seeking to access urgently needed insulin under 
23 subsection 3 or to participate in a manufacturer's patient assistance program under this 
24 section.  A manufacturer shall maintain the confidentiality of any information received 
25 from any individual applying for the manufacturer's patient assistance program under this
