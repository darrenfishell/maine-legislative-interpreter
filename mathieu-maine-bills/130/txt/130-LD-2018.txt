Page 1 - 130LR2654(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §1310, as amended by PL 1997, c. 691, §4 and affected by PL 
3 1999, c. 127, Pt. D, §5, is repealed.
4Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §1310-A is enacted to read:
5§1310-A.  Intervenor funding
61. Qualification for funding. Consistent with rules adopted by the commission 
7 pursuant to subsection 3, the commission may order or provide funding in accordance with 
8 subsection 2 to an intervenor in a commission proceeding upon a finding that:
9 A. The position of the intervenor is not adequately represented by the Office of the 
10 Public Advocate or commission staff;
11 B. The intervenor is likely to substantially contribute to the proceeding and to assist in 
12 the resolution of the issues raised in the proceeding; and
13 C. Participation in the proceeding by the intervenor would impose a significant 
14 financial hardship on the intervenor.
152. Funding sources. If the commission finds pursuant to subsection 1 that an 
16 intervenor in a commission proceeding qualifies for funding, the commission may, 
17 consistent with rules adopted by the commission pursuant to subsection 3:
18 A. Order a utility involved in the commission proceeding to compensate the intervenor.  
19 Compensation provided by a utility under this paragraph may be recovered in rates; or
20 B. Provide compensation to the intervenor from the Public Utilities Commission 
21 Regulatory Fund established pursuant to section 116 and filing fees, subject to the 
22 commission's determination that funds are available for that purpose. 
233. Rules. The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section. Rules adopted 
24 pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
25 subchapter 2-A.  
26 A. Rules adopted by the commission pursuant to this subsection must include, but are 
27 not limited to:
28 (1) The process by which the commission will determine whether an intervenor 
29 qualifies for funding;
30 (2) Identification of which expenses incurred by an intervenor may qualify for 
31 funding, which types of proceedings intervenor funding will be available for and 
32 the point in an eligible proceeding at which an intervenor qualifying for funding 
33 will be provided with the funding;
34 (3) The process by which the commission will ensure that funding provided to an 
35 intervenor is used properly and the process by which funding provided to an 
36 intervenor that is not entirely used by the intervenor may be recovered by the 
37 commission; and
38 (4) The methods by which the commission will ensure that the public is notified 
39 about the availability of intervenor funding under this section.
Page 2 - 130LR2654(01)1 B. Rules adopted by the commission pursuant to this subsection may include, but are 
2 not limited to:
3 (1) Establishment of a cap on the amount of funding that a qualified intervenor 
4 may be provided in a commission proceeding;
5 (2) Establishment of a process by which the commission will give priority under 
6 this section to qualified intervenors representing environmental justice 
7 populations.  If the commission establishes such a process by rule, the commission, 
8 in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall include in 
9 that rule a definition for "environmental justice populations" that is consistent with 
10 any definition for that term adopted by the department in a department rule; and
11 (3) Any other provisions the commission determines necessary for the 
12 implementation of this section.
13Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §349-C is enacted to read:
14§349-C.  Environmental justice
151. Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
16 following terms have the following meanings.
17 A. "Environmental justice" means the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all 
18 people regardless of race, color, national origin or income with respect to the 
19 development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, rules, 
20 regulations and policies.
21 B. "Fair treatment" means that no group of people bears a disproportionate share of the 
22 negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, governmental or 
23 commercial operations or policies.
24 C. "Frontline communities" means those people and communities that experience the 
25 consequences of climate change first and to a greater degree than other people and 
26 communities. 
27 D. "Meaningful involvement" means, with respect to the department's decision-making 
28 process, that:
29 (1) People and communities have an opportunity to participate in the decision-
30 making process regarding activities that have the potential to affect the 
31 environment or public health;
32 (2) The department seeks out and facilitates the involvement in the decision-
33 making process of potentially affected people and communities; 
34 (3) The contributions of people and communities to the decision-making process 
35 can influence the department's decision making; and
36 (4) The department considers in its decision making the concerns and contributions 
37 of people and communities provided as part of the decision-making process.
382. Consideration of environmental justice populations and frontline communities.  
39 The department shall ensure that persons in environmental justice populations and frontline 
40 communities are provided with fair and equitable access to the department's decision-
41 making processes under sections 341-D and 341-H.  The department shall adopt rules 
42 establishing procedures to implement this subsection.
Page 3 - 130LR2654(01)1 A. Rules adopted by the department pursuant to this subsection must define 
2 "environmental justice populations," taking into consideration, at a minimum, median 
3 household income, race, ethnicity and English language proficiency.  
4 B. Rules adopted by the department pursuant to this subsection are routine technical 
5 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A, except that the board shall hold 
6 a hearing in accordance with Title 5, section 8052 prior to the adoption of any rule 
7 proposed pursuant to this subsection.
