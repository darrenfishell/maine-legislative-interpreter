Page 1 - 130LR2252(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §436-A, sub-§1-C is enacted to read:
31-C.  Area of special flood hazard.  "Area of special flood hazard" means land in a 
4 floodplain having a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year, as identified in the  
5 applicable federal flood insurance study and corresponding flood insurance rate maps.
6Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §436-A, sub-§7-A, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 231, §1, is repealed 
7 and the following enacted in its place:
87-A.  Height.  "Height" means:
9 A. With respect to new or existing principal or accessory structures, including legally 
10 existing nonconforming structures, located within an area of special flood hazard that 
11 have been or are proposed to be constructed, relocated, reconstructed or elevated to be 
12 consistent with the minimum elevation required by a local floodplain management 
13 ordinance, the vertical distance between the bottom of the sill of the structure to the 
14 highest point of the structure, excluding chimneys, steeples, antennas and similar 
15 appurtenances that have no floor area; and
16 B. With respect to new or existing principal or accessory structures other than those 
17 described in paragraph A, including legally existing nonconforming structures, the 
18 vertical distance between the mean original grade at the downhill side of the structure, 
19 prior to construction, and the highest point of the structure, excluding chimneys, 
20 steeples, antennas and similar appurtenances that have no floor area.
21Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §439-A, sub-§4, ¶C-1 is enacted to read:
22 C-1.  Notwithstanding the limitations on height imposed under paragraphs B and C, 
23 the height of a structure that is a legally existing nonconforming principal or accessory 
24 structure may be raised to, but not above, the minimum elevation necessary to be 
25 consistent with the local floodplain management elevation requirement, as long as the 
26 structure is relocated, reconstructed or elevated within the boundaries of the parcel so 
27 that the water body or wetland setback requirement is met to the greatest practical 
28 extent.  This paragraph applies to structures that:
29 (1) Have been or are proposed to be relocated, reconstructed or elevated to be 
30 consistent with the local floodplain management elevation requirement; and
31 (2) Are located in an area of special flood hazard.
32SUMMARY
33 This bill amends how the height of a new or existing principal or accessory structure, 
34 including a legally existing nonconforming structure, located in the shoreland zone is 
35 measured when the structure is also located in an area of special flood hazard and there is 
36 a minimum elevation required for structures by a local floodplain management ordinance. 
37 This bill specifically allows for an exception to shoreland zoning height requirements for 
38 legally existing nonconforming structures located in an area of special flood hazard in order 
39 to be consistent with a local floodplain management elevation requirement.33
