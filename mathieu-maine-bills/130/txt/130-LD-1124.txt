34 contributions from supporters of a proposed specialty license plate is less than $50,000, the 
35 sponsor is required to provide the difference between the amount collected and $50,000 to 
36 the Secretary of State.  The bill also increases from 2 years to 3 years the amount of time 
37 allowed for a sponsor to collect signatures of supporters of a proposed specialty license 
38 plate before submission to the Secretary of State.  The bill also provides that these changes 
39 apply retroactively to September 1, 2019 so that the changes apply to sponsors currently in 
40 the 2-year window of meeting the specialty license plate requirements.31
