This amendment eliminates the General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) of $146,465 in fiscal year 2022-23 as the health insurance check box is required beginning in the tax year 
that begins January 1, 2023 instead of January 1, 2022. All costs to DHHS are delayed until fiscal year 2023-24. As 
amended, the bill still retains the General Fund appropriation of $58,855 in fiscal year 2022-23 to the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services to implement the tax check-off box on the individual income tax return.
