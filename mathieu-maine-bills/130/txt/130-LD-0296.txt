25 Services or its designee under Title 22, section 7308, subsection 2 who is a part-year 
26 resident taxpayer is allowed a refundable credit of $2,000, multiplied by a ratio, the 
27 numerator of which is the individual's income as modified by section 5122 for that portion 
28 of the taxable year during which the individual was a resident plus the individual's income 
29 from sources within this State, as determined under section 5142, for that portion of the

33 2022, a family caregiver certified by the Department of Health and Human Services or its 
34 designee under Title 22, section 7308, subsection 2 who is a nonresident taxpayer is 
35 allowed a refundable credit of $2,000, multiplied by the ratio of the individual's Maine 
36 adjusted gross income to the individual's federal adjusted gross income as modified by 
37 section 5122.
384.  Transfer of funds from the Respite Care Fund.  By August 1, 2022 and annually 
39 thereafter, the assessor shall notify the State Controller of revenue loss attributable to

Page 3 - 130LR0206(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill expands the role of the Department of Health and Human Services with 
3 respect to the Respite Care Fund to include services for family caregivers.  It provides a 
4 refundable income tax credit of $2,000 for certified family caregivers and permits eligible 
5 family caregivers to choose to receive services or a tax credit.  It requires the department, 
6 by routine technical rulemaking, to prescribe the details of eligibility for family caregiver 
7 services and the tax credit within the context of the Respite Care Fund and the National 
8 Family Caregiver Support Program.  The bill requires the department to establish a 
9 stakeholder group to assist in carrying out the purposes of the family caregiver program, 
10 evaluating the effect of the program and assisting with the compilation of an annual report.  
11 The bill requires that revenue losses to the General Fund attributable to the family caregiver 
12 income tax credit be reimbursed from the Respite Care Fund and provides that aggregate 
13 expenditures under the Respite Care Fund may not exceed $5,000,000 annually excluding 
14 existing funds and federal revenue.
