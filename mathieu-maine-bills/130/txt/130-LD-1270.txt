2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA c. 301, sub-c. 5 is enacted to read:
3SUBCHAPTER 5
4RESENTENCING UNITS
5§1861.  Resentencing units
61.  Resentencing units.  The Attorney General and every district attorney under Title 
7 30-A, chapter 1, subchapter 5 shall maintain within their respective offices a resentencing 
8 unit that timely reviews the sentences of imprisonment of criminal cases prosecuted by the 
9 Attorney General's or that district attorney's office that have not yet commenced or are 
10 ongoing to determine whether to reduce or terminate a sentence in the interests of fairness 
11 or justice.
122.  Review.  A resentencing unit shall review for reduction or termination under 
13 subsection 1 the following sentences:
14 A.  A sentence in which the person's current sentence is no longer necessary to ensure 
15 public safety or the interests of fairness or justice given the nature of the crime 
16 committed and the specific facts of the crime, with priority given to a person currently 
17 incarcerated who is either over 50 years of age or was sentenced for a crime committed 
18 as a minor;
19 B.  A sentence for a person who committed an offense under Title 17-A, section 202 
20 in which the person did not commit the killing or have an intent to kill;
21 C.  A sentence of at least 5 years for a person who is eligible for release within the next 
22 12 months; 
23 D.  A sentence of a person who is suffering from a terminal or debilitating illness;
24 E.  A sentence in which an illegality or irregularity may exist or have been committed; 
25 and
26 F.  A sentence that the resentencing unit determines should be reviewed in the interests 
27 of fairness or justice.
283.  Recommendation; appeal.  A resentencing unit shall make in a timely manner a 
29 recommendation to the Attorney General or district attorney in whose office the 
30 resentencing unit is located whether to reduce or terminate a sentence reviewed.  The 
31 Attorney General or district attorney may reject, accept or modify a recommendation and 
32 file a petition under chapter 305-A of a sentence that the Attorney General or district 
33 attorney determines requires reduction or termination.
34Sec. 2.  15 MRSA §2122, as amended by PL 2011, c. 601, §4, is further amended to 
35 read:
36§2122.  Purpose
37 This chapter provides a comprehensive and, except for direct appeals from a criminal 
38 judgment, exclusive method of review of those criminal judgments and of post-sentencing 
Page 2 - 130LR1380(01)39 proceedings occurring during the course of sentences.  It is a remedy for unfair, unjust or 
40 illegal restraint and other impediments specified in section 2124 that have occurred directly 
41 or indirectly as a result of an illegal criminal judgment or post-sentencing proceeding.  It 
42 replaces the remedies available pursuant to post-conviction habeas corpus, to the extent 
43 that review of a criminal conviction or proceedings were reviewable, the remedies available 
44 pursuant to common law habeas corpus, including habeas corpus as recognized in Title 14, 
45 sections 5501 and 5509 to 5546, coram nobis, audita querela, writ of error, declaratory 
46 judgment and any other previous common law or statutory method of review, except appeal 
47 of a judgment of conviction or juvenile adjudication and remedies that are incidental to 
48 proceedings in the trial court.  The substantive extent of the remedy of post-conviction 
49 review is defined in this chapter and not defined in the remedies that it replaces; provided 
50 that this .  This chapter provides and is must be construed to provide relief for those persons 
51 required to use this chapter as required by the Constitution of Maine, Article I, Section 10.
14Sec. 3.  15 MRSA §2125, as amended by PL 2013, c. 266, §4, is further amended to 
15 read:
16§2125.  Ground for relief
17 A person who satisfies the prerequisites of section 2124 may show that the challenged 
18 criminal judgment or sentence is unlawful or unlawfully imposed, or a sentence is unfair 
19 or unjust under section 1861 or that the impediment resulting from the challenged post-
20 sentencing proceeding is unlawful, as a result of any error or ground for relief, whether or 
21 not of record, unless the error is harmless or unless relief is unavailable for a reason 
22 provided in section 2126, section 2128 unless section 2128‑A applies, or section 2128‑B.
23Sec. 4.  15 MRSA §2126, as amended by PL 2013, c. 266, §5, is further amended to 
24 read:
25§2126.  Exhaustion
26 A Except for a petition brought under section 1861, a person under restraint or 
27 impediment specified in section 2124 must also demonstrate that the person has previously 
28 exhausted remedies incidental to proceedings in the trial court, on appeal or administrative 
29 remedies. A person who has taken an appeal from a judgment of conviction, a juvenile 
30 adjudication or a judgment of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity is not 
31 precluded from utilizing the remedy of this chapter while the appeal is pending.  The post-
32 conviction review proceeding is automatically stayed pending resolution of the appeal 
33 unless the Appellate Court on motion and for good cause otherwise directs.
34Sec. 5.  15 MRSA §2128, first ¶, as amended by PL 2011, c. 601, §9, is further 
35 amended to read:
36 A Except for a petition brought under section 1861, a person under restraint or 
37 impediment specified in section 2124 shall demonstrate that any ground of relief has not 
38 been waived.  The bases of waiver are as follows.
39Sec. 6.  15 MRSA §2128-B, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
404.  Filing deadline for resentencing review.  A petition to reduce or terminate a 
41 sentence filed pursuant to section 1861 may be brought from the date of sentencing to the 
42 termination of the sentence.1

2 amended to read:
31.  Filing of petition.  Petitions shall must be filed as follows.
4 A.  A proceeding for post-conviction review shall must be commenced by filing a 
5 petition in the Superior Court in the county specified in section 2123.
6 B.  If Except for a petition brought pursuant to section 1861, if the petitioner desires to 
7 have counsel appointed, he the petitioner shall file an affidavit of indigency in the form 
8 prescribed by the Supreme Judicial Court. If the petitioner is incarcerated, the affidavit 
9 shall must be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate officer of the institution 
10 in which the petitioner is incarcerated as to the amount of money or securities on 
11 deposit to the petitioner's credit in any account in the institution. The failure to include 
12 an affidavit of indigency with the petition does not bar the court from appointing 
13 counsel upon a subsequent filing of an affidavit of indigency.
14 C.  Once the petition has been filed, the clerk shall forward a copy of the petition and 
15 any separate documents filed with it to the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and to 
16 the prosecutorial office that earlier represented the State in the underlying criminal or 
17 juvenile proceeding or, for a petition brought pursuant to section 1861, to the person 
18 whose sentence is being reviewed.
19SUMMARY
20 This bill requires the Attorney General and every district attorney to maintain a 
21 resentencing unit to review ongoing sentences of cases they prosecuted to determine 
22 whether the sentences should be reduced or terminated in the interests of fairness or justice.  
23 The resentencing units are to review sentences that are disproportionate based upon the 
24 crime committed, especially for incarcerated people over 50 years of age or who committed 
25 the offense as a minor, sentences of at least 5 years when release is 12 months or less away, 
26 sentences for felony murder when the person did not commit the killing or intend to kill, 
27 sentences for people with terminal or debilitating illnesses, sentences in which illegalities 
28 or irregularities may have occurred and any other sentences that the resentencing unit 
29 determines should be reviewed in the interests of fairness or justice.  The resentencing unit 
30 makes a recommendation to the Attorney General or district attorney who may accept, 
31 reject or modify the recommendation and may file a petition for resentencing review at any 
32 time during the duration of the sentence to request the court for a reduction or termination 
33 of the sentence.20
