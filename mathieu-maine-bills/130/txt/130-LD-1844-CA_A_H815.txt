SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the provisions of the bill that authorize the Department of 
Marine Resources to designate certain research and aquaculture lease applications as 
subject to special fees based on the size, uniqueness or complexity of the application. It 
clarifies that, for purposes of a research or aquaculture lease to construct or operate in 
coastal waters a facility for the suspended culture of marine organisms, 11 suspended culture" 
includes all forms of culture except for the placement of marine organisms on the ocean 
bottom without the use of gear of any type. The amendment retains the provision in the bill 
that authorizes the department to hold an emergency aquaculture lease for shellfish without 
having to also hold another lease and the provision in the bill that authorizes the 
Commissioner of Marine Resources to issue a marine organism aquaculture license for 
more than one calendar year.

Fiscal Detail and Notes Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment #1( /-f-g' I '5') 
Committee: Marine Resources 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue decrease -General Fund 
Any additional costs to the Department of Marine Resources as a result of changes to the definition of what 
constitutes a suspended culture of marine organisms or changes authorizing the department to hold an emergency 
aquaculture lease for shellfish are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
Provisions allowing the issuance of marine organism aquaculture licenses for more than one calendar year are not 
expected to result in significant revenue reductions from a reduced number of licenses issued.
