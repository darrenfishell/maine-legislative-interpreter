29SUMMARY
30 This bill ensures future funding for the Tobacco Prevention and Control Program 
31 administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Bureau of Health by 
32 requiring funding for the program to be a minimum of the actual revenue collected on the 
33 sales of all tobacco products plus available funds in the Fund for a Healthy Maine or the 
34 amount of funding for state tobacco control programs as determined by the United States 
35 Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
36 and recommended for Maine, whichever is less.
37 This bill increases the cigarette tax from $2.00 per pack of 20 cigarettes to $4.00 per 
38 pack of 20 cigarettes, beginning November 1, 2021.  Because the tax on other tobacco 
39 products is determined by the tax on cigarettes, this bill, by operation of law, increases the 
40 tax on other tobacco products, such as cigars and smokeless tobacco, by the same 
41 percentage change as the increase in the tax on cigarettes.5
