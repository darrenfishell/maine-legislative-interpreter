Page 1 - 130LR0082(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, agriculture is critically important to the State's economy and food supply, 
4 and, because the State's working farms positively contribute to their communities as well 
5 as the State's overall quality of life, it is in the public interest to strengthen the agricultural 
6 sector by preserving productive agricultural soils, working farmland and open space land; 
7 and
8Whereas, the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources 
9 Conservation Service has defined, mapped and classified the State's most productive 
10 agricultural soil types as prime farmland, unique farmland, farmland of statewide 
11 importance and farmland of local importance throughout the State; and
12Whereas, the preservation and conservation of farmland and open space land, 
13 agricultural and natural resources based businesses, productive agricultural soils and 
14 maintenance of open space land are important to the people of the State, as evidenced by 
15 the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 8 and the farm and open space tax law in the 
16 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, chapter 105, subchapter 10, which confers current use 
17 property tax assessment to prevent the conversion of farmland and open space land to 
18 nonagricultural uses; and
19Whereas, the protection of farmland is identified as a conservation priority by the 
20 Land for Maine's Future program; and
21Whereas, the Land for Maine's Future Board has, since 1987, awarded partial funding 
22 to 42 farms in 9 counties to protect 9,882 acres of working farmland; and
23Whereas, farmland protection projects funded by the Land for Maine's Future Board 
24 leverage matching funds from a variety of partners, including the United States Department 
25 of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, land trusts, municipalities, water 
26 districts and nongovernmental organizations; and
27Whereas, for these reasons it is critically important that this legislation take effect 
28 before the expiration of the 90-day period; and
29Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
30 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
31 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
