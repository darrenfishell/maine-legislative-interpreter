2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to amend the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, chapter 605 and Title 
6 38, chapter 3 to protect Maineâ€™s ocean waters, support robust regulatory oversight and the 
7 long-term health of the aquaculture industry and advance the interests of the people of the 
8 State.
9 The bill seeks to examine the permitting framework for aquaculture leases in this State 
10 and best practices regarding aquaculture leases in other states in order to improve the 
11 regulatory system in this State.
12 The bill also seeks to examine the resources available to the Department of Marine 
13 Resources for regulatory oversight of aquaculture leases, including the review of 
14 aquaculture lease applications and the number of staff available to provide regulatory 
15 oversight and environmental monitoring throughout the terms of aquaculture leases.  The 
16 examination will include a review of statutory caps on the amounts charged for aquaculture 
17 lease rents and aquaculture lease application fees.
18 The bill requires that all rights conveyed to a lessee under an aquaculture lease revert 
19 back to the State at the expiration of the lease term and that transfers or renewals of 
20 aquaculture leases must demonstrate compliance with all currently applicable standards at 
21 the time of transfer or renewal. Further, for leases greater than 5 acres in size, the bill 
22 removes the current exemption from compliance with Title 38, chapter 3, including the 
23 Natural Resources Protection Act and the site location of development laws.
24 The bill amends the laws governing the lease size requirements to provide that each 
25 lease may not exceed 50 acres in area and that a person may not have an ownership interest 
26 in more than 10 leases nor total lease areas in excess of 100 acres.
27 Finally, the bill requires the Department of Marine Resources to convene stakeholder 
28 meetings to develop a strategic aquaculture plan with input from leaders in the aquaculture, 
29 lobster, fishing, tourism and recreation industries, as well as experts from the 
30 environmental and water quality regulatory community. The plan must be designed to 
31 support robust regulatory oversight, protect the marine environment, reduce conflicts with 
32 aquaculture sites and public trust users of the marine and coastal waters, improve the lease 
33 application and review process, support the long-term health of the aquaculture industry 
34 and advance the interests of the people of the State. The plan must identify whether certain 
35 areas of waters of the State can be designated as expedited permitting areas for aquaculture 
36 leases in excess of 5 acres.4
