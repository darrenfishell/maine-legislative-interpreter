10 to read:
11§11152.  Antlerless deer; regulation and authority to issue permits
121.  Permit required.  Except as otherwise authorized pursuant to this Part, a person 
13 may not hunt antlerless deer as authorized in this section unless that person has a valid 
14 permit issued under this section or is hunting in an area that is designated by rule as open 
15 to the hunting of antlerless deer or either-sex deer without an antlerless deer permit.
16 A.  Each day a person violates this subsection that person commits a Class E crime for 
17 which a minimum fine of $50 and an amount equal to twice the applicable license fee 
18 must be imposed.
191-A.  Antlerless deer in wildlife management districts with no permits issued.  
20 Except as otherwise provided in this Part, a person may not hunt or possess an antlerless 
21 deer in a wildlife management district or a portion of a wildlife management district that 
22 does not have permits issued in which the taking of antlerless deer is not allowed.  A person 
23 may possess in one of those districts an antlerless deer that has been lawfully registered in 
24 another district where permits have been issued antlerless deer may be legally taken.
25 A person that violates this subsection commits a Class D crime for which a minimum fine 
26 of $1,000 must be imposed, and the court shall impose a sentencing alternative involving 
27 a term of imprisonment of at least 3 days, none of which may be suspended.
282.  Authority to regulate taking of antlerless deer.  The commissioner may regulate 
29 the taking of antlerless deer by rule within an area of the State as necessary to maintain 
30 deer populations in balance with available habitat if the demarcation of each area follows 
31 recognizable physical boundaries such as rivers, roads and railroad rights-of-way.  This 
32 subsection does not apply to a person with a special antlerless deer permit under subsection 
33 7.
342-A.  Authority to regulate taking of antlerless deer in certain areas within wildlife 
35management districts where no permits are issued.  The commissioner may by rule issue 
36 permits in a designated geographical area within a wildlife management district where no 
37 antlerless deer permits are issued to maintain balanced deer populations. A designated 
38 geographical area under this subsection may consist of an entire town or other area but 
39 must have a demarcation of the area that follows recognizable physical boundaries such as 
40 rivers, roads and railroad rights-of-way.
413.  Rulemaking.  The commissioner may adopt rules necessary for the administration, 
42 implementation, enforcement and interpretation of this section, except that the 
43 commissioner is not authorized to establish an antlerless deer permit system lottery unless 
Page 2 - 130LR0098(01)44 otherwise specified in this section.  The commissioner may appoint clerks or agents under 
45 section 10801 to process applications for permits issued under this section. A clerk or agent 
46 appointed by the commissioner to process applications shall charge a fee of $2 for each 
47 application processed by that clerk or agent under this section.  Rules adopted by the 
48 commissioner that provide for permits to be issued to nonresident hunters must provide 
49 that:
7 B.  No more than 15% of the antlerless deer permits issued in any one district or in any 
8 one zone may be issued to nonresident hunters.
9 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
10 chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
114.  Landowner consideration.  An antlerless deer permit system lottery adopted by 
12 the commissioner pursuant to this section may include a provision giving special 
13 consideration to landowners who keep their lands open to hunting by the public.  As part 
14 of the special consideration to those landowners, the commissioner shall provide at least 
15 25% of the available antlerless deer permits in a wildlife management district to eligible 
16 landowners that apply for an antlerless deer permit in that district.  Any 2 or more areas of 
17 land owned by the same person that are open for hunting and that would be contiguous 
18 except for being divided by one or more roads are considered contiguous for the purposes 
19 of determining landowner eligibility for special consideration under this subsection.
205.  Hunter permit transfers.  A resident may take an antlerless deer if another resident 
21 who holds a valid antlerless deer permit transfers the permit to that resident by identifying 
22 the name and address of the transferee on the permit as well as any other information 
23 reasonably requested by the commissioner and then returns the permit to the department 
24 prior to the start of the firearm season on deer.  A nonresident may take an antlerless deer 
25 if another nonresident who holds a valid antlerless deer permit transfers the permit to that 
26 nonresident by identifying the name and address of the transferee on the permit as well as 
27 any other information reasonably requested by the commissioner and then returns the 
28 permit to the department prior to the start of the firearm season on deer.  The commissioner 
29 shall record a transfer under this subsection and return the permit to the transferee.  A valid 
30 permit must be in the possession of the transferee in order for the transferee to take an 
31 antlerless deer.
325-A.  Permit transfer to junior hunter.  Notwithstanding subsection 5, a junior hunter 
33 may take an antlerless deer if another person who holds a valid antlerless deer permit 
34 transfers that permit to that junior hunter by identifying the name and address of the 
35 transferee on the permit as well as any other information reasonably requested by the 
36 commissioner and then returns the permit to the department at least 48 hours prior to the 
37 junior hunter's hunting antlerless deer.  Upon transfer of the antlerless deer permit to a 
38 junior hunter, the transferor may not hunt an antlerless deer pursuant to the transferred 
39 permit but remains eligible, unless otherwise prohibited, to take a deer other than an 
40 antlerless deer in accordance with this Part.
41 The commissioner shall record a transfer under this subsection and return the permit to the 
42 transferee.  A valid permit must be in the possession of the transferee in order for the 
43 transferee to take an antlerless deer.
447.  Special antlerless deer permit.  The commissioner shall issue a special antlerless 
45 deer permit to an eligible person who has lost all or part of one or more lower limbs, not 1

47 lower limbs.  The commissioner shall issue a permit upon application and after the 
48 applicant verifies that person's ambulatory disability with a letter signed by a physician 
49 confirming the person's condition.  A person who is issued a special antlerless deer permit 
50 under this subsection may take an antlerless deer in any part of the State open to the taking 
51 of antlerless deer pursuant to subsection 3.
78.  Junior hunter consideration.  An antlerless deer permit system lottery adopted by 
8 the commissioner pursuant to this section may include a provision giving special 
9 consideration to persons with a valid junior hunting license. As part of the special 
10 consideration to junior hunters, the commissioner shall provide at least 25% of the available 
11 antlerless deer permits in a wildlife management district to persons with a valid junior 
12 hunting license who apply for an antlerless deer permit in that district.
