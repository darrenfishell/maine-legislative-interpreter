15ยง9558.  Legislative findings
16 The Legislature finds that:
171.  Federal Communications Decency Act.  While Section 230 of the federal 
18 Communications Decency Act of 1996 protects online service providers who host 3rd-party 
19 content, it does not protect against deceptive trade practices, bad faith transactions, unfair 
20 dealing and fraudulent inducements; 
212.  No preemption.  State laws consistent with Section 230 of the federal 
22 Communications Decency Act of 1996 are not preempted by Section 230;
233.  Social media website standards.  This State has a compelling interest in holding 
24 certain social media websites that have created a digital semi-public square to higher 
25 standards, especially when those websites have engaged in fraud, false advertising and 
26 deceptive trade practices;
274. Social media website practices.  Some social media websites have engaged in 
28 fraud, false advertising and deceptive trade practices at great expense to the health, safety, 
29 and welfare of consumers in this State, while making it difficult for others to compete with 
30 those websites; 
315.  Compelling interest of State.  The State has a compelling interest in helping its 
32 citizens enjoy their free exercise of their rights in certain semi-public forums commonly 
33 used for religious and political speech, regardless of the political or religious affiliation 
34 they ascribe to; and
356.  Protection of freedom of religion and speech.  This Act is necessary to ensure the 
36 continued free practice by the citizens of Maine of religion and speech as guaranteed under 
37 the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and under the Constitution of Maine, 
38 Article I, Sections 3 and 4, respectively.
