Page 1 - 130LR2671(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, under current law, employees of or applicants for employment with law 
4 enforcement agencies, including as emergency services dispatchers for those agencies, are 
5 subject to polygraph examinations; and
6Whereas, other public safety dispatchers, such as for fire or emergency medical 
7 services, are not subject to polygraph examinations, despite having access to confidential 
8 records such as investigative and criminal intelligence information; and
9Whereas, to ensure that such information is not misused, it is necessary to correct this 
10 disparity as soon as possible; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  32 MRSA ยง7364, sub-ยง3, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 316, ยง3 and affected 
17 by ยง5, is amended to read:
183.  Exception.  This section does not apply to employees of or applicants for 
19 employment with law enforcement agencies or county and regional communications 
20 centers.   As used in this subsection, "county and regional communications centers" means 
21 publicly owned and publicly operated entities that dispatch emergency services, but does 
22 not include an entity operated by or under the control of a law enforcement agency.
23Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
24 takes effect when approved.
25SUMMARY
26 Under current law, law enforcement employees and applicants for positions with law 
27 enforcement agencies are subject to polygraph examinations as a condition of obtaining or 
28 holding employment; this includes persons who operate as dispatchers.  Other emergency 
29 service dispatch employees or applicants for employment as emergency service dispatch 
30 employees are not subject to polygraph examinations, even though those employees may 
31 have access to confidential information.
32 This bill allows county and regional communications centers, which are dispatch 
33 centers for all emergency services, to require employees and applicants for employment to 
34 submit to a polygraph examination.26
