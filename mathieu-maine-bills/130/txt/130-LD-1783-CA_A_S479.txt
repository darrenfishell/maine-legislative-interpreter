1 C. If under federal law, with respect to a high-deductible health plan offered for use 
2 with a health savings account in accordance with the federal Internal Revenue Code,

14 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
15 number to read consecutively. 
16 SUMMARY 
17 This amendment replaces the bill with language that reflects model legislation adopted 
18 by the National Council of Insurance Legislators. Like the bill, the amendment requires 
19 health insurance carriers and their pharmacy benefits managers to include cost-sharing 
20 amounts paid on behalf of an insured when calculating the insured's contribution to any 
21 out-of-pocket maximum, deductible or copayment when a drug does not have a generic 
22 equivalent or was obtained through prior authorization, a step therapy override exception 
23 or an exception or appeal process. 
24 The amendment adds a requirement that a person who pays any amount on behalf of a 
25 covered person for a covered prescription drug must notify the covered person prior to or 
26 within 7 days of the acceptance of the financial assistance of the total amount of assistance 
27 available and the duration for which it is available and prohibits the conditioning of the 
28 assistance on enrollment in a specific health plan or type of health plan. The amendment 
29 also adds language providing an exception when application of the requirements to a person 
30 who has a health savings account would result in ineligibility for that health savings account 
31 under federal law except for items or services that are determined to be preventive care. 
32 As in the bill, the requirements apply to prescription drug benefits provided pursuant 
33 to a contract or policy of insurance by a carrier or a pharmacy benefits manager on behalf 
34 of a carrier on or after January 1, 2023.

Potential future biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Requiring the inclusion of certain cost sharing amounts made on behalf of participants in a covered prescription drug 
benefit be included in the calculation of plan out-of-pocket maximums, deductibles and copayments could result in an 
increase in costs to the State Employee Health Plan beginning in the plan year starting July 1, 2023. The amount and 
timing of the additional costs will depend on the volume of such payments (e.g., manufacturer coupons) currently 
being paid on behalf of participants and the type and use of payments that could be available in the future.
