21 A.  For the purposes of this section, "child-related sexual offense" means the following 
22 sexual offenses if, at the time of the commission of the offense, the victim was under 
23 18 years of age or the victim was a student enrolled in a private or public elementary, 
24 secondary or special education school, facility or institution and the person was a

44 Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and each of the

8 B.  A court may award primary residence of a minor child or parent-child contact with 
9 a minor child to a parent who has been convicted of a child-related sexual offense or 
10 whose name appears on the sex offender registry of any state only if the court finds 
11 that contact between the parent and child is in the best interest of the child and that 
12 adequate provision for the safety of the child can be made.  A petitioner who is a parent 
13 who has been convicted of a child-related sexual offense or whose name appears on 
14 the sex offender registry of any state must attach to the petition for primary residence 
15 or parent-child contact a forensic risk assessment performed by a licensed clinical

17 residence or parent-child contact.  For purposes of this paragraph, "forensic risk 
18 assessment" means a determination about the likelihood that a person will commit

23 offense may occur only if there is another person or agency present to supervise the 
24 contact.  If the court allows a family or household member to supervise parent-child 
25 contact, the court shall establish conditions to be followed during that contact.  
26 Conditions include, but are not limited to, those that:
27 (1)  Minimize circumstances when the family of the parent who is a sex offender 
28 or sexually violent predator would be supervising visits;
29 (2)  Ensure that contact does not damage the relationship with the parent with 
30 whom the child has primary physical residence;
31 (3)  Ensure the safety and well-being of the child; and
32 (4)  Require that supervision be provided by a person who is physically and 
33 mentally capable of supervising a visit and who does not have a criminal history 
34 or history of abuse or neglect.
35SUMMARY
36 Current law prohibits a person who has committed certain sex offenses from initiating 
37 contact with a person under 14 years of age.  This bill prohibits a person who has committed 
38 certain sex offenses or whose name appears on the sex offender registry of any state from 
39 initiating contact with a minor.  The bill also requires a parent who has committed certain 
40 sex offenses or whose name appears on the sex offender registry of any state and who 
41 petitions for primary residence or parental contact with a minor child to submit to the court 
42 a forensic risk assessment.  The bill extends the best interest of the child standard in 
43 deciding petitions for primary residence or parental contact to petitions in which a parent's 1
