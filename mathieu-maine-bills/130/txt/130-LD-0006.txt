3Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §221, sub-§3-A, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 313, §3, is 
4 amended to read:
53-A.  On or after January 1, 1994 the The superintendent may accept a full examination 
6 report by the insurance regulatory authority of the insurance company's state of domicile 
7 or port-of-entry state for any foreign or alien insurer licensed in this State in lieu of an 
8 examination by the superintendent if, at the time of the examination, that regulatory 
9 authority was accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' 
10 Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program or if the examination was 
11 performed under the supervision of an accredited insurance regulatory authority or with the 
12 participation of one or more examiners who are employed by an accredited insurance 
13 regulatory authority and who, after a review of the examination workpapers and report, 
14 state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the 
15 standards and procedures required by the regulatory authority.
16Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §222, sub-§7, ¶A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 238, Pt. A, §14 
17 and affected by §34, is further amended to read:
18 A.  The superintendent shall hold a hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth 
19 in the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, section 231 and Title 5, chapter 375, 
20 subchapter 4, within 30 days after the application required by subsection 4‑C has been 
21 filed with the superintendent.  The superintendent shall make a determination within 
22 30 days after the conclusion of that hearing.  The superintendent shall approve any 
23 purchase, exchange, merger or other change of control referred to in subsection 4‑C 
24 unless the superintendent finds that:
25 (1)  After the change of control, the domestic insurer could not satisfy the 
26 requirements for the issuance of a certificate of authority according to requirements 
27 in force at the time of the issuance or last renewal or continuation of its certificate 
28 of authority to do the insurance business that it intends to transact in this State;
29 (2)  The effect of the purchases, exchanges, merger of a controlling person of the 
30 insurer or other changes of control may be substantially to lessen competition in 
31 insurance in this State or tend to create a monopoly in this State or would violate 
32 the laws of this State or of the United States relating to monopolies or restraints of 
33 trade;
34 (3)  The financial condition of an acquiring person would jeopardize the financial 
35 stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;
36 (4)  The plans or proposals that the acquiring or divesting person has to liquidate 
37 the insurer, to sell its assets or to merge it with any person, or to make any other 
38 major change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair or 
39 prejudicial to policyholders;
40 (5)  The competence, experience and integrity of those persons who would control 
41 the operation of the insurer indicate that it would not be in the interest of 
42 policyholders or the public to permit them to do so;
43 (6)  Any merger of a domestic insurer does not comply with section 3474; or
Page 2 - 130LR0116(01)1 (7)  The change of control would tend to affect adversely the contractual 
2 obligations of the domestic insurer or its ability and tendency to render service in 
3 the future to its policyholders and the public.
4Sec. 4.  24-A MRSA §222, sub-§7-A, ¶D, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 238, Pt. A, 
5 §15 and affected by §34, is amended by amending subparagraph (3) to read:
6 (3)  The proceeding is public to the same extent as a proceeding conducted under 
7 subsection 7, except that deliberations of a decision-making panel are not public 
8 proceedings and communications in the course of those deliberations among panel 
9 members and their advisers, other than the decision itself, are not public records.
10Sec. 5.  24-A MRSA §222, sub-§8, ¶B-3, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 238, Pt. A, 
11 §18 and affected by §34, is amended to read:

13 $500,000,000 or more or is a member of an insurance holding company system with 
14 annual premium of $1,000,000,000 or more, shall conduct an own risk and solvency 
15 assessment in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph and the ORSA 
16 guidance manual at least annually, and also at any time when there are significant 
17 changes to the risk profile of the insurer or its insurance holding company system, 
18 except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (1).  For purposes of this paragraph, 
19 "premium" means direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium, including 
20 international direct and assumed premium but excluding premiums reinsured with the 
21 Federal Crop Insurance Corporation within the United States Department of 
22 Agriculture, Risk Management Agency and with the National Flood Insurance 
23 Program within the United States Department of Homeland Security, Federal 
24 Emergency Management Agency.
25 (1)  This paragraph does not apply if:
26 (a)  The insurer is an agency, authority or instrumentality of the United States, 
27 its possessions and territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District 
28 of Columbia or a state or political subdivision of a state;
29 (b)  The insurer and its insurance holding company system did not meet either 
30 of the minimum premium criteria of this paragraph in the financial statements 
31 immediately preceding their most recent financial statements and the 
32 superintendent has not required compliance with this paragraph under 
33 subparagraph (2); or
34 (c)  The superintendent has granted a waiver from the requirements of this 
35 paragraph based upon unique circumstances.  In deciding whether to grant a 
36 waiver, the superintendent may consider the type and volume of business 
37 written by the insurer, the ownership and organizational structure of the insurer 
38 and its insurance holding company system and any other factor the 
39 superintendent considers relevant to the insurer or the insurer's insurance 
40 holding company system.  If the insurer's insurance holding company system 
41 includes insurers domiciled in more than one state, the superintendent shall 
42 coordinate with the lead regulator and with other domiciliary regulators in 
43 considering whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver.
Page 3 - 130LR0116(01)1 (2)  The superintendent may require an insurer that does not meet either of the 
2 minimum premium criteria of this paragraph to comply with the requirements of 
3 this paragraph if:
4 (a)  The superintendent determines that the insurer should be subject to this 
5 paragraph due to unique circumstances, including, but not limited to, the type 
6 and volume of business written by the insurer, the ownership and 
7 organizational structure of the insurer and its insurance holding company 
8 system, federal agency requests and international supervisor requests;
9 (b)  The insurer is subject to a corrective order or required to adopt a risk-based 
10 capital plan under sections 6453 to 6456;
11 (c)  The superintendent has determined in accordance with rules adopted by 
12 the superintendent that the insurer is in hazardous financial condition; or
13 (d)  The superintendent has determined that the insurer otherwise exhibits 
14 qualities of a troubled insurer.
15 (3)  If an insurer's insurance holding company system has annual premium of 
16 $1,000,000,000 or more, the assessment and reporting required by this paragraph 
17 must be conducted for each insurer within the insurance holding company system, 
18 either on a systemwide basis or separately for insurers or combinations of insurers 
19 within the insurance holding company system.
20 (4)  An insurer subject to this paragraph shall maintain a risk management 
21 framework to assist the insurer with identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing 
22 and reporting on its material and relevant risks.  An insurer may satisfy this 
23 requirement by participating in an applicable risk management framework 
24 maintained by the insurance holding company system of which the insurer is a 
25 member.
26 (5)  An insurer subject to this paragraph shall prepare and submit regular ORSA 
27 summary reports that satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph and shall 
28 provide additional information to the superintendent upon request.
29 (a)  Beginning no later than 2015, the ORSA summary report must be prepared 
30 at least annually, on a timetable consistent with the insurer's internal strategic 
31 planning processes, and submitted to the lead regulator of the insurer's 
32 insurance holding company system, as determined by the procedures within a 
33 financial analysis handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance 
34 Commissioners.  If the superintendent is not the lead regulator, the insurer shall 
35 submit the insurer's or insurance holding company system's most recent ORSA 
36 summary report to the superintendent on request.
37 (b)  The ORSA summary report must be prepared consistent with the ORSA 
38 guidance manual.  Documentation and supporting information must be 
39 maintained and made available upon examination by or upon request of the 
40 superintendent.
41 (c)  The insurer's or insurance holding company system's chief risk officer, or 
42 other executive having responsibility for the oversight of the insurer's 
43 enterprise risk management process, shall sign the ORSA summary report 
44 attesting to the best of the signer's belief and knowledge that the insurer applies 
Page 4 - 130LR0116(01)45 the enterprise risk management process described in the ORSA summary 
46 report and that a copy of the report has been provided to the insurer's board of 
47 directors or the appropriate committee of the board.
4 (d)  An insurer may comply with this paragraph by providing the most recent 
5 ORSA summary report and a report or reports that are substantially similar to 
6 the ORSA summary report that are provided by the insurer or another member 
7 of its insurance holding company system to the insurance commissioner of 
8 another state or to an insurance supervisor or regulator of a foreign jurisdiction 
9 if that report provides information that is comparable to the information 
10 described in the ORSA guidance manual.  Any report in a language other than 
11 English must be accompanied by an English translation.
12 (6)  The superintendent's review of the ORSA summary report, and any additional 
13 requests for information, must be consistent with accepted regulatory procedures 
14 for the analysis and examination of multistate or global insurers and insurance 
15 groups.
16Sec. 6.  24-A MRSA §731-B, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2007, c. 169, Pt. C, §1, is 
17 further amended to read:
181.  Credit Except to the extent that the liabilities ceded are secured in accordance with 
19 subsection 3, credit for reinsurance is allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset 
20 or a deduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurance is 
21 ceded to a solvent assuming insurer that:
22 A.  Is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this State, provided the assuming 
23 insurer maintains surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than the sum 
24 of paid-in capital stock, if any, and surplus as otherwise required for a certificate of 
25 authority for the kinds and amount of insurance and assumed reinsurance the insurer 
26 has in force net of any applicable ceded reinsurance.  If the assuming insurer is licensed 
27 as a special purpose reinsurance vehicle pursuant to section 782 and maintains capital 
28 and surplus in accordance with the requirements of section 787, credit for reinsurance 
29 under a special purpose reinsurance vehicle contract, as defined in section 781, 
30 subsection 15, is allowed only to the extent that:
31 (1)  The fair value of the assets held by or for the benefit of the ceding insurer 
32 equals or exceeds the obligations due and payable to the ceding insurer by the 
33 special purpose reinsurance vehicle under the special purpose reinsurance vehicle 
34 contract;
35 (2)  The assets are held in accordance with the requirements in subchapter 6;
36 (3)  The assets are administered in the manner and pursuant to arrangements under 
37 subchapter 6;

39 795; and
40 (5)  The contract complies with all other relevant requirements of subchapter 6;
41 B.  Is domiciled and licensed in a state that employs standards regarding credit for 
42 reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this section, if the insurer:
43 (1)  Submits to the authority of this State to examine its books and records; and1
2
3
Page 5 - 130LR0116(01)1 (2)  Except where reinsurance is ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling 
2 arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system, maintains a 
3 surplus regarding policyholders in an amount not less than $20,000,000;
4 B-1.  Is accredited as a reinsurer in this State, in accordance with the following 
5 standards.
6 (1)  To apply for accreditation, a reinsurer shall file with the superintendent a 
7 written application on a form prescribed by the superintendent, accompanied by 
8 the fee prescribed in section 601, subsection 26 and an agreement to submit to the 
9 jurisdiction of the courts of this State and to the authority of the superintendent to 
10 examine the reinsurer's books and records.
11 (2)  An accredited reinsurer must be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance 
12 in at least one state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien reinsurer, 
13 that reinsurer must be entered through and licensed to transact insurance or 
14 reinsurance in at least one state.
15 (3)  An accredited reinsurer shall file with the superintendent, as part of its 
16 application and annually thereafter, a copy of its annual statement filed with the 
17 insurance department of its state of domicile or United States port of entry and a 
18 copy of its most recent audited financial statement.
19 (4)  A reinsurer applying for accreditation that maintains a surplus as regards to 
20 policyholders in an amount not less than $20,000,000 is deemed to be accredited 
21 if the reinsurer's application is not denied by the superintendent within 90 days 
22 after submission of the application.  The superintendent has the discretion to grant 
23 accreditation to an applicant with a surplus less than $20,000,000 subject to such 
24 terms and conditions as the superintendent determines to be necessary and 
25 appropriate for the protection of domestic ceding insurers and their policyholders. ;
26 B-2.  Is certified as a reinsurer in this State and secures its obligations in accordance 
27 with this paragraph.
28 (1)  To be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer must meet the following 
29 requirements:
30 (a)  The assuming insurer must be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance 
31 or reinsurance in a jurisdiction determined by the superintendent to be a 
32 qualified jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (3);
33 (b)  The assuming insurer must maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its 
34 equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the superintendent pursuant to 
35 rules adopted under subsection 7;
36 (c)  The assuming insurer must maintain financial strength ratings from 2 or 
37 more rating agencies determined by the superintendent to be acceptable 
38 pursuant to rules adopted under subsection 7;
39 (d)  The assuming insurer must agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this State 
40 and to appoint an agent for service of process in the same manner as provided 
41 for authorized insurers under section 421 and agree to provide security for 
42 100% of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by 
Page 6 - 130LR0116(01)43 United States ceding insurers if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a 
44 final United States judgment;
3 (e)  The assuming insurer must agree to meet applicable information filing 
4 requirements as determined by the superintendent, both with respect to an 
5 initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis.  Documents filed 
6 with the superintendent by the assuming insurer are not public records if the 
7 documents are confidential under the laws of the assuming insurer's 
8 domiciliary jurisdiction;
9 (f)  The assuming insurer must pay the application fee prescribed in section 
10 601, subsection 26-A and, to the extent provided in rules adopted under 
11 subsection 7, must agree to pay reasonable costs of review; and
12 (g)  The assuming insurer must satisfy any other requirements for certification 
13 established by the superintendent.
14 (2)  An association including incorporated and individual unincorporated 
15 underwriters may be a certified reinsurer.  In order to be eligible for certification, 
16 in addition to satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (1):
17 (a)  The association may satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements 
18 through the capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, of the association 
19 and its members, which must include a joint central fund that may be applied 
20 to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an 
21 amount determined by the superintendent to provide adequate protection;
22 (b)  The incorporated members of the association may not be engaged in any 
23 business other than underwriting as a member of the association and must be 
24 subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's 
25 domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and
26 (c)  Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the 
27 association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the 
28 superintendent an annual certification by the association's domiciliary 
29 regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member of the association or, if 
30 a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent 
31 public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.
32 (3)  The superintendent shall create and publish a list of jurisdictions that are 
33 qualified to serve as the domiciliary regulators of certified reinsurers.
34 (a)  In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of an alien 
35 assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the 
36 superintendent shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the 
37 reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an 
38 ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits and the extent of reciprocal 
39 recognition afforded by the jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in 
40 the United States.  To be recognized as qualified, a jurisdiction must agree to 
41 share information and cooperate with the superintendent with respect to all 
42 certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction.  A jurisdiction may not 
43 be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the superintendent has determined 
44 that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United 1
2
Page 7 - 130LR0116(01)45 States judgments and arbitration awards.  The superintendent may consider 
46 additional factors.
3 (b)  If the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has published a 
4 list of recommended qualified jurisdictions, the superintendent shall consider 
5 that list in determining qualified jurisdictions.  If the superintendent recognizes 
6 a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list published by the 
7 National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the superintendent shall 
8 make detailed findings of fact supporting the recognition in accordance with 
9 criteria to be developed in rules adopted under subsection 7.
10 (c)  United States jurisdictions that are accredited by the National Association 
11 of Insurance Commissioners must be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.
12 (d)  If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified 
13 jurisdiction, the superintendent may suspend the reinsurer's certification 
14 indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.
15 (4)  The superintendent shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due 
16 consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating 
17 agencies determined to be acceptable pursuant to rules adopted under subsection 
18 7.  The superintendent shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.
19 (5)  A certified reinsurer shall secure all obligations assumed from United States 
20 ceding insurers under this subsection, and under comparable laws of other states, 
21 at a level consistent with its rating and in a form acceptable to the superintendent, 
22 in compliance with rules adopted under subsection 7.
23 (a)  If the security is insufficient, the superintendent shall reduce the allowable 
24 credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency and may impose further 
25 reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the 
26 certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.
27 (b)  The reinsurer may secure its obligations as a certified reinsurer through a 
28 multibeneficiary trust that meets the requirements of paragraph C and 
29 subsection 2-A, with the following modifications.
30 (i)  The maximum credit allowable may exceed the value of the qualifying 
31 security to the extent provided in this subparagraph.
32 (ii)  The minimum trusteed surplus is $10,000,000, rather than the amount 
33 specified in paragraph C.
34 (iii)  If the certified reinsurer also maintains a multibeneficiary trust for 
35 obligations required to be fully secured under paragraph C or comparable 
36 laws of other states, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust 
37 accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued 
38 or renewed with reduced security as permitted by this paragraph or 
39 comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations 
40 that are required to be fully secured.  The trust accounts may not be 
41 approved as qualifying security unless the reinsurer has bound itself, by 
42 the language of the trust and by agreement with the insurance regulator 
43 with principal oversight of each such trust account, to apply, upon 
44 termination of any such trust account, the remaining surplus of that trust 1
2
Page 8 - 130LR0116(01)45 to the extent necessary to fund any deficiency of any other such trust 
46 account.
3 (c)  If a certified reinsurer does not secure its obligations through a qualifying 
4 multibeneficiary trust, it must secure its obligations to the ceding insurer 
5 consistent with the requirements of subsection 3, except that the maximum 
6 credit allowable may exceed the value of the qualifying security to the extent 
7 provided in this subparagraph.
8 (d)  For purposes of this subparagraph, a certified reinsurer whose certification 
9 has been terminated for any reason must be treated as a certified reinsurer 
10 required to secure 100% of its obligations, unless the superintendent has 
11 continued to assign a higher rating, as permitted by other provisions of this 
12 section, to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose 
13 certification has been suspended.
14 (6)  If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a jurisdiction 
15 accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the 
16 superintendent may defer to that jurisdiction's certification to grant certification in 
17 this State and may defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction.
18 (7)  A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this State may 
19 request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify 
20 for a reduction in security for its in-force business.  An inactive certified reinsurer 
21 shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this subsection, and 
22 the superintendent shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the 
23 reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business. ;
24 B-3.  Meets each of the conditions established in subparagraphs (2) to (8).
25 (1)  For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms have the following 
26 meanings.
27 (a)  "Covered agreement" means an agreement, entered into pursuant to the 
28 federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 31 
29 United States Code, Sections 313 and 314, that is in effect or in a period of 
30 provisional application and addresses the elimination, under specified 
31 conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any 
32 reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this State or for 
33 allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance.
34 (b)  "Reciprocal jurisdiction" means a jurisdiction that is:
35 (i)  A non-United States jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered 
36 agreement with the United States, as long as each agreeing jurisdiction is 
37 within its legal authority to enter the agreement, or, in the case of a covered 
38 agreement between the United States and the European Union, a member 
39 state of the European Union;
40 (ii) A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for 
41 accreditation under the financial regulation standards and accreditation 
42 program of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; or1
2
Page 9 - 130LR0116(01)1 (iii)  A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the superintendent pursuant 
2 to paragraph B-2, subparagraph (3), that meets certain additional 
3 requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of covered 
4 agreements, as specified by the superintendent by rule.
5 (2)  The assuming insurer must have its domicile or head office in, and be licensed 
6 in, a reciprocal jurisdiction.
7 (3)  The assuming insurer must have and maintain on an ongoing basis minimum 
8 capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology 
9 applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount established by rule.  If the 
10 assuming insurer is an association that includes incorporated and individual 
11 unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain on an ongoing basis 
12 minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to 
13 the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund 
14 containing a balance in amounts established by rule.
15 (4)  The assuming insurer must have and maintain on an ongoing basis a minimum 
16 solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, as established by rule.  If the assuming 
17 insurer is an association that includes incorporated and individual unincorporated 
18 underwriters, it must have and maintain on an ongoing basis a minimum solvency 
19 or capital ratio, as applicable, in the jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its 
20 head office or is domiciled, as applicable.
21 (5)  The assuming insurer must agree, and provide adequate assurance to the 
22 superintendent in a form specified by the superintendent by rule, as follows:
23 (a)  The assuming insurer must provide prompt written notice and explanation 
24 to the superintendent if it fails to meet the minimum requirements set forth in 
25 subparagraph (3) or (4) or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious 
26 noncompliance with applicable law;
27 (b)  The assuming insurer must consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the 
28 courts of this State and to the appointment of the superintendent as agent for 
29 service of process.  The superintendent may require the assuming insurer to 
30 include such consent in each reinsurance agreement for which credit is taken 
31 under this paragraph.  This division does not limit or in any way alter the 
32 capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute 
33 resolution mechanisms, except to the extent that such agreements are 
34 unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws;
35 (c)  The assuming insurer must consent in writing to pay all final judgments, 
36 wherever enforcement is sought, that are obtained by a ceding insurer or its 
37 legal successor and that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction 
38 where the judgment was obtained;
39 (d)  Each reinsurance agreement for which credit is taken under this paragraph 
40 must include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security for 
41 the full amount of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance 
42 ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement 
43 of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction where 
44 the final judgment was obtained or resists enforcement of a properly 
Page 10 - 130LR0116(01)45 enforceable arbitration award, whether the judgment or award is obtained by 
46 the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate.  
47 As used in this division, "resolution estate" means the estate of an insurer or 
48 reinsurer that has been placed into a receivership or comparable legal status; 
49 and
6 (e)  The assuming insurer must confirm that it is not participating in any solvent 
7 scheme of arrangement that involves this State's ceding insurers and must 
8 agree to notify the ceding insurer and the superintendent and to provide 
9 security for the full amount of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding 
10 insurer should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of 
11 arrangement. Such security must be in a form consistent with the provisions of 
12 paragraph B-2 and subsection 3 and as specified by the superintendent by rule.
13 (6)  The assuming insurer or its legal successor must provide, on behalf of itself 
14 and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the superintendent as 
15 specified by the superintendent by rule, if requested by the superintendent.
16 (7)  The assuming insurer must maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims 
17 under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria established by rule.
18 (8)  The supervisory authority for insurance for the jurisdiction of the assuming 
19 insurer must confirm to the superintendent on an annual basis that, as of the 
20 preceding December 31st or the annual date specified in statute for reporting to 
21 that supervisory authority in the assuming insurer's jurisdiction, the assuming 
22 insurer complies with the requirements of subparagraphs (3) and (4).
23 (9)  The assuming insurer may provide additional information on a voluntary basis.
24 (10)  The superintendent shall promptly create, publish and administer a list of 
25 reciprocal jurisdictions as described in this subparagraph.
26 (a)  The superintendent shall include all reciprocal jurisdictions identified in 
27 subparagraph (1), division (b), subdivisions (i) and (ii) in the list maintained 
28 pursuant to this subparagraph.
29 (b)  If the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has published a 
30 list of recommended reciprocal jurisdictions, the superintendent shall consider 
31 that list and may defer to that list in determining whether a jurisdiction qualifies 
32 as a reciprocal jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (1), division (b), 
33 subdivision (iii).  The superintendent may determine that a jurisdiction that 
34 does not appear on the recommended list is a reciprocal jurisdiction in 
35 accordance with criteria established in rules adopted by the superintendent.
36 (c)  If a jurisdiction has been determined to be a reciprocal jurisdiction pursuant 
37 to subparagraph (1), division (b), subdivision (iii), the superintendent, in 
38 accordance with a process established by rule by the superintendent, may 
39 determine that the jurisdiction is no longer a reciprocal jurisdiction and remove 
40 it from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the 
41 jurisdiction no longer meets the conditions of this paragraph.  Upon removal 
42 of a reciprocal jurisdiction from the list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an 
43 assuming insurer that has its head office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction is 
44 allowed only as otherwise allowed pursuant to this section.1

Page 11 - 130LR0116(01)1 (11)  The superintendent shall promptly create, publish and administer a list of 
2 assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (2) 
3 to (8) for recognition for credit for reinsurance.  The superintendent may add an 
4 assuming insurer to the list if it has been listed under a substantially similar law by 
5 a jurisdiction accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
6 or if, upon a request for recognition of eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the 
7 information to the superintendent as required under subparagraph (5) and complies 
8 with any additional requirements that the superintendent may impose by rule, 
9 except to the extent that those requirements conflict with an applicable covered 
10 agreement.
11 (12)  If the superintendent determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets 
12 one or more of the conditions of this paragraph, the superintendent may suspend 
13 or revoke the recognition of the assuming insurer for credit for reinsurance under 
14 this paragraph in accordance with procedures established by rule.
15 (a)  While an assuming insurer's recognition for credit is suspended, a 
16 reinsurance agreement issued, amended or renewed after the effective date of 
17 the suspension does not qualify for credit under this paragraph.  Credit may be 
18 granted only to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the 
19 contract are secured in accordance with other provisions of this subsection or 
20 with subsection 3.
21 (b)  If an assuming insurer's recognition for credit is revoked, credit for 
22 reinsurance may not be granted after the effective date of the revocation with 
23 respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, 
24 including reinsurance agreements entered into before the date of revocation, 
25 except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract 
26 are secured in a form acceptable to the superintendent and consistent with other 
27 provisions of this subsection or with subsection 3.
28 (13)  If a ceding insurer that has been granted credit under this paragraph is subject 
29 to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation, the ceding insurer 
30 or its representative may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which 
31 the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring the assuming insurer 
32 to post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.
33 (14)  This paragraph does not limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a 
34 reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that 
35 reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this section or other 
36 applicable law or rule.
37 (15)  Credit under this paragraph may be taken only for reinsurance pursuant to 
38 reinsurance agreements entered into, renewed or amended on or after the effective 
39 date of this paragraph and only with respect to losses incurred or reserves reported 
40 on or after the date on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility 
41 requirements pursuant to subparagraphs (2) to (8) or the effective date of the new 
42 reinsurance agreement, amendment or renewal, whichever is later.
43 This subparagraph does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for 
44 reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this paragraph, as long 
Page 12 - 130LR0116(01)45 as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of this 
46 section.
3 (16)  Nothing in this paragraph:
4 (a)  Authorizes an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security 
5 provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the terms of 
6 the agreement; or
7 (b)  Limits, or in any way alters, the capacity of parties to any reinsurance 
8 agreement to renegotiate the agreement;
9 C.  Maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution for the 
10 payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns and 
11 successors in interest.
12 (1)  The assuming insurer shall report annually to the superintendent information 
13 substantially the same as that required to be reported on the National Association 
14 of Insurance Commissioners Annual Statement form by licensed insurers to enable 
15 the superintendent to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund.
16 (2)  In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust must consist of a trusteed 
17 account representing the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance 
18 ceded by United States ceding insurers and, in addition, unless the assuming 
19 insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the 
20 trust for at least 3 full years, must include a trusteed surplus of at least $20,000,000.  
21 The trust must provide that after the assuming insurer has permanently 
22 discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least 3 full years, 
23 the insurance regulator with principal oversight of the trust may authorize a 
24 reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an 
25 assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the 
26 protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in light of 
27 reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development.  The risk assessment may 
28 involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash 
29 flows, and must consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the 
30 lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect 
31 of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency.  The 
32 minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than 30% 
33 of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United 
34 States ceding insurers covered by the trust.
35 (3-A)  A group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters 
36 may secure its obligations with funds held in trust in compliance with the following 
37 standards.
38 (a)  For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, 
39 amendment or renewal date on or after January 1, 1993, the trust must consist 
40 of a trusteed account in an amount at least equal to the respective underwriters' 
41 several liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States domiciled 
42 ceding insurers to any underwriter that is a member of the group.
43 (b)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, for reinsurance ceded 
44 under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before December 1
2
Page 13 - 130LR0116(01)45 31, 1992 and not amended or renewed after that date, the trust must consist of 
46 a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' 
47 several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in 
48 the United States.
5 (c)  In addition, the group shall maintain a trusteed surplus of at least 
6 $100,000,000 held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding 
7 insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.
8 An incorporated member of the group may not be engaged in any business other 
9 than underwriting as a member of the group and is subject to the same level of 
10 solvency regulation and control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the 
11 unincorporated members. Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to 
12 be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the 
13 superintendent an annual certification by the group's domiciliary regulator of the 
14 solvency of each underwriter member of the group or, if a certification is 
15 unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants.
16 (4-A)  The superintendent in rules adopted pursuant to subsection 7 may establish 
17 alternative criteria for approval of a reinsurance trust if the superintendent 
18 determines that the criteria provide adequate protection to policyholders of United 
19 States ceding insurers and are in substantial conformance with standards approved 
20 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
21 (5)  The trust must be established in a form approved by the superintendent and 
22 consistent with any rules adopted by the superintendent pursuant to this section.  
23 The form of the trust and any amendments to the trust must also have been 
24 approved by the insurance regulatory official of the state where the trust is 
25 domiciled or of another state that, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has 
26 accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.  The trust instrument must 
27 provide that contested claims are valid and enforceable upon the final order of any 
28 court of competent jurisdiction in the United States.  The trust must vest legal title 
29 to its assets in the trustees of the trust for the benefit of the assuming insurer's 
30 United States ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest.  The trust 
31 and the assuming insurer are subject to examination, as determined by the 
32 superintendent, at the assuming insurer's expense.  The trust must remain in effect 
33 for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the 
34 reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.
35 (6)  The trustees of the trust shall report to the superintendent in writing by 
36 February 28th of each year, setting forth the balance of the trust and listing the 
37 trust's investments at the end of the preceding year and certifying the date of 
38 termination of the trust, if so planned, or certifying that the trust does not expire 
39 before December 31st of the current year.
40 (7)  The corpus of the trust is to be valued as any other admitted asset or assets; or
41 D.  Does not meet the requirements of paragraph A, B, B-1, B-2, B-3 or C, but only 
42 with respect to risks located in a jurisdiction where that reinsurance is required by law.  
43 The superintendent may waive the requirements of subsections 2 and 5 to the extent 
44 that compliance with those requirements is not feasible for compulsory reinsurance 
45 subject to this paragraph.  The superintendent for good cause after notice and 1

36SUMMARY
37 This bill updates several provisions of the Maine Insurance Code by incorporating 
38 recent amendments to model laws adopted by the National Association of Insurance 
39 Commissioners, or NAIC, and making related technical changes.
40 It corrects a conflict in the law governing examination of insurers by the Superintendent 
41 of Insurance and eliminates obsolete transition language.
42 It clarifies that adjudicatory proceedings conducted under the Maine Revised Statutes, 
43 Title 24-A, section 222 to review changes of control of domestic insurers are governed by 
Page 16 - 130LR0116(01)44 the same procedural requirements as other Department of Professional and Financial 
45 Regulation, Bureau of Insurance adjudicatory proceedings and that multistate proceedings 
46 conducted under Maine law are considered public proceedings to the same extent as single-
47 state proceedings subject only to the exceptions expressly enumerated in Title 24-A, section 
48 222, subsection 7-A, paragraph D.
6 It clarifies that when an insurer or insurance group is required to conduct an own risk 
7 and solvency assessment, the assessment must be conducted in compliance with the NAIC 
8 Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Guidance Manual, as well as include the 
9 summary report as required under current law.
10 It corrects a conflict between Title 24-A, section 731-B, subsections 1 and 3, clarifying 
11 that subsection 1 is not the exclusive mechanism by which credit for reinsurance may be 
12 granted, and clarifies that section 731-B, subsection 3 allows other forms of security to the 
13 extent authorized by the Superintendent of Insurance by rule.
14 It provides that documents that a certified reinsurer is required to file are not public 
15 records if they are confidential under the laws of the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction.
16 It brings Maine into compliance with the bilateral agreements entered into by the 
17 United States with the European Union and the United Kingdom by enacting the 2019 
18 amendments to the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law, which provide a mechanism 
19 for large, financially strong non-United States reinsurers to qualify for eligibility by 
20 reciprocity to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers without posting security.
21 It corrects a NAIC drafting error from 2000 that inadvertently transposed the content 
22 of the definitions of "repurchase transaction" and "reverse repurchase transaction."
23 It corrects an inconsistency between Title 24-A, section 4215, subsection 1, which 
24 requires health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, to be examined by the 
25 Superintendent of Insurance at least every 3 years, and Title 24-A, section 221, which 
26 applies to HMOs pursuant to Title 24-A, section 4222-B, subsection 5 and which permits 
27 the examination period to be extended to 5 years.  It also authorizes the superintendent to 
28 accept the domiciliary chief regulatory official's examination in satisfaction of Maine's 
29 requirement when a company is domiciled outside Maine.  The purpose of these 
30 amendments is to allow Maine to participate in coordinated examinations with 
31 synchronized schedules for HMOs that are members of insurance groups.
32 It amends the reciprocity provisions of Maine's receivership laws by recognizing as 
33 reciprocal states those states with laws determined by the Superintendent of Insurance to 
34 be adequate or substantially similar to the NAIC's model insolvency laws, and brings Maine 
35 into conformity with the NAIC's guidelines for interstate recognition of stays and 
36 injunctions in receivership.1
