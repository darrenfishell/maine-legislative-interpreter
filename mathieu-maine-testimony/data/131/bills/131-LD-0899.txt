Page 1 - 131LR1016(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, federal guidance issued under the Public Readiness and Emergency 
4 Preparedness Act authorized trained pharmacy technicians to administer certain 
5 immunizations under certain circumstances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for the 
6 duration of the federal public health emergency declaration; and
7Whereas, preparing for the end of the federal public health emergency declaration by 
8 codifying in state law the authority of pharmacy technicians to administer vaccines is 
9 necessary to ensure there is no gap in the provision of services by pharmacy technicians; 
10 and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §13831, sub-§6 is enacted to read:
176.  Administration of vaccines by pharmacy technician.  A pharmacy technician 
18 may administer vaccines in accordance with the requirements of this section if the 
19 pharmacy technician completes a certification program in accordance with this subsection 
20 and is working under the direct supervision of a pharmacist who meets the requirements of 
21 section 13832. The certification program must be approved by the board and have at least 
22 6 hours of vaccine-related training that includes, at a minimum, training on the safe and 
23 effective administration of vaccines, including potential allergic reactions to vaccines.
24Sec. 2.  32 MRSA §13832, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 308, §3, is amended 
25 to read:

33 subchapter satisfactory to the board, including instruction in the areas identified in 
34 subsection 4 received as part of the pharmacist's pharmacy degree program; or
35 C.  Possesses a current certificate of administration issued by another jurisdiction that 
36 authorizes the pharmacist to administer drugs comparable to those authorized under 
37 this chapter and that is based on the pharmacist's completion of training or course work 
38 as described in subsection 4, or its equivalent as determined by the board, and has 
39 continuous administration practice since the pharmacist received such training or since 
40 completion of a retraining program as required in this subchapter, as long as such 
41 retraining incorporates the areas identified in subsection 4;
Page 2 - 131LR1016(01)1Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
2 takes effect when approved.
