/ This amendment changes the ongmal bill's ieqmrement for labor standards for loggmg and truckmg to a requirement 
for certam perfonnance-based mdicators and adds a prohibit10n on payments to trade associat10ns that are registered 
as lobbyists with the Commiss10n on Governmental Ethics and Elect10n Practices as a condition of certificat10n 
If the two maJor certification programs are m compliance or can get m compliance with these cntena, there will be no 
impact on timber sale revenue by the Department of Agriculture, Conservat10n and F01estry If both programs cannot 
meet the cntena, there could be a substantial reduct10n m timber sales revenue from the State's loss of certtficat10n 
While loss of one certification may occm, it is unlikely that both certtficat10ns will be lost Thei ef01 e, the potential 
loss of revenue 1s not anticipated to be sigmficant
