satisfy the notice reguirement in this subsection by providing the insurer with a copy of the 
notice of the sale or transfer of the mortgage sent to the consumer.'

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT •I• to H.P. 358, L.D. 553 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment clarifies that the provision in the 
3 bill requiring notice by the holder of a mortgage on a residential property to the insurer of 
4 the property if a mortgage is sold or transfetTed applies when the holder of the mortgage 
5 controls funds of a consumer in an escrow account for the payment of insurance premiums. 
6 The amendment also clarifies that the provision in the bill applies to an assignee or servicer 
7 of a mortgage and moves the provision from the Maine Insurance Code to the Maine 
8 Consumer Credit Code since the notice obligation is on the creditor, assignee or servicer 
9 of a mortgage.
