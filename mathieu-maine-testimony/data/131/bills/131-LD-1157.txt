3SUBCHAPTER 4
4LICENSE FEE STABILIZATION
5ยง60-O.  Fee stabilization
61. Review.  The Director of the Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation 
7 within the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, referred to in this section 
8 as "the director," shall by July 1st of each budget biennium review the revenue derived 
9 from each license fee collected by a licensing board or entity under this Title.
102. Stabilization.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title to the contrary, if 
11 the director determines pursuant to subsection 1 that the amount of revenue collected in the 
12 previous biennium from the fees of a licensing board or entity exceeds the expenses 
13 incurred by that licensing board or entity in the performance of its duties over that 
14 biennium, the director shall by rule reduce the fees by multiplying each fee collected by 
15 that licensing board or entity by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the 
16 excess revenue and the denominator of which is total amount of revenue collected.  The 
17 resulting license fee must remain in place for the ensuing biennium.  If the fees are 
18 deposited into a nonlapsing fund and there are funds remaining in the fund at the end of the 
19 budget biennium, the amount of those funds is deemed to be excess revenue. 
20 Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 
21 375, subchapter 2-A.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill requires the Director of the Office of Professional and Occupational 
24 Regulation within the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation by July 1st of 
25 each fiscal biennium to review the revenue derived from each license fee collected by a 
26 licensing board or entity.  If the director determines that the amount of revenue collected 
27 in the previous biennium from the fees of a licensing board or entity exceeds the expenses 
28 incurred by that licensing board or entity in the performance of its duties, the director shall 
29 by rule reduce the fees by a fraction calculated by dividing the amount of excess revenue 
30 by the total amount of revenue collected.  The resulting license fee must remain in place 
31 for the ensuing biennium.  If the fees are deposited into a nonlapsing fund and there are 
32 funds remaining in the fund at the end of the budget biennium, the amount of those funds 
33 is deemed to be excess revenue.23
