date and location of the scheduled interview and the conduct of the interview and appeal.

evidence. The deputy shall make a prompt determination of the issue based solely on any 
written statements of interested parties filed with the bureau before the interview, together 
with the evidence presented by interested parties who personally participated in the 
interview by telephone or e-mail or other electronic means. Upon request and notice to all
