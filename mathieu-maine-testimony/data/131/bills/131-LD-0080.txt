26SUMMARY
27 This bill amends the provisions of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or 
28 "TANF," program that relate to income disregards for the purposes of calculating a 
29 recipient's benefits.  Current law provides that 100% of all earned income for the first 3 
30 months of employment and 75% of all earned income for the 4th to 6th months of 
31 employment must be disregarded from recipients' monthly earnings. This bill clarifies that 
32 this employment must have begun while participating in the TANF program.  It also 
33 provides that 100% of the first 3 months of increased earned income received while 
34 participating in TANF and 75% of the 4th to 6th months of increased earned income 
35 received while participating in TANF are subject to these disregard provisions. The bill 
36 also makes a clarifying change by replacing the word "it" with "benefit."27
