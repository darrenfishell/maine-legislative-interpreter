3CHAPTER 1066
4MAINE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT
5ยง3941.  Short title
6 This Act may be known and cited as "the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act."
7ยง3942.  Declaration of policy
8 The purpose of the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act is recognition by the State that 
9 Indian tribes have a continuing and compelling governmental interest in an Indian child 
10 whether or not the child is in the physical or legal custody of an Indian parent, an Indian 
11 custodian or an Indian extended family member at the commencement of an Indian child 
12 custody proceeding or the Indian child has resided or is domiciled on an Indian reservation. 
13 The State is committed to protecting the essential tribal relations and best interests of an 
14 Indian child by promoting practices in accordance with all laws designed to prevent the 
15 Indian child's voluntary or involuntary out-of-home placement and, whenever such 
16 placement is necessary or ordered, by placing the Indian child, whenever possible, in a 
17 placement that reflects the unique values of the child's tribal culture and that is best able to 
18 assist the child in establishing, developing and maintaining a political, cultural and social 
19 relationship with the Indian child's tribe and tribal community. It is the policy of the State 
20 to cooperate fully with Indian tribes and tribal members and citizens in this State and 
21 elsewhere in order to ensure that the intent and provisions of this Act are enforced.

10 H. Identifying community resources including housing, financial, transportation, 
11 mental health, substance abuse and peer support services and actively assisting the

14 I. Monitoring progress and participation in services;

25 Indian tribes must be given an opportunity to agree on which tribe is the Indian tribe for 
26 purposes of this Act.  If the Indian tribes are not able to come to an agreement, the court

10 B.  The Indian child's tribe does not have a tribal court, or the tribal court of the Indian 
11 child's tribe declines jurisdiction; or
12 C.  The court determines that good cause exists to deny the transfer.  The party 
13 opposing transfer has the burden to show good cause by clear and convincing evidence.  
14 The good cause determination must be based on which court is best positioned to 
15 adjudicate the proceeding, not on the potential outcome of the proceeding. In 
16 determining whether good cause exists, the court may not consider: 
17 (1)  Whether the foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding 
18 is at an advanced stage if the Indian child's parent, Indian custodian or tribe did not 
19 receive notice of the child custody proceeding until an advanced stage; 
20 (2)  Whether there have been prior proceedings involving the Indian child for 
21 which no petition to transfer was filed; 
22 (3)  Whether transfer could affect the placement of the Indian child; 
23 (4)  The Indian child's cultural connections with the tribe or its reservation; or

304.  Full faith and credit.  The State shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, 
31 records and judicial proceedings of any Indian tribe that are applicable to an Indian child 
32 custody proceeding to the same extent that the State gives full faith and credit to the public 
33 acts, records and judicial proceedings of any other governmental entity.
34ยง3945. Court proceedings
351.  Determination of Indian child status.  In any Indian child custody proceeding or 
36 emergency proceeding, the District Court or Probate Court shall ask each participant 
37 whether the participant knows or has reason to know that the child is an Indian child.  The 
38 court shall use the procedures in 25 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 23.107 to 
39 determine if a child may be an Indian child.
402.  Notice; time for commencement of proceedings; additional time for 
41preparation.  In any involuntary Indian child custody proceeding in which the District 
42 Court or Probate Court or a party to the proceeding knows or has reason to know that an 1
2
Page 6 - 131LR1324(01)43 Indian child is involved, the party seeking the adoptive placement, foster care placement, 
44 preadoptive placement or termination of parental rights of or to an Indian child shall notify 
45 the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child's tribe of the pending proceedings and 
46 of their right of intervention.  
5 A.  The notice in any involuntary Indian child custody proceeding involving an Indian 
6 child must be written in clear and understandable language and must conform with the 
7 requirements of 25 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 23.111(d).  The District Court 
8 and Probate Court may create a form that complies with this paragraph.
9 B.  The notice must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.  The notice to 
10 the Indian child's tribe must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and via 
11 e-mail, at the mailing address and e-mail address on file with the United States 
12 Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs.  
13 C.  If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian tribe 
14 cannot be determined, notice under this subsection must be given to the United States 
15 Secretary of the Interior in like manner, who has 15 days after receipt to provide the 
16 requisite notice to the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian tribe. 
17 D.  An original or a copy of each notice sent under this subsection must be filed with 
18 the court together with any return receipts or other proof of service.  
19 E.  The first hearing in the proceeding may not be held until at least 10 days after receipt 
20 of the notice by the parent, Indian custodian and Indian tribe or the United States 
21 Secretary of the Interior.  
22 F.  On the request of a parent, Indian custodian or Indian tribe, the court shall grant a 
23 continuance of up to 20 additional days to enable the requester to prepare for the 
24 hearing.
253.  Appointment of counsel.  Parents and Indian custodians are entitled to legal 
26 counsel in any removal, placement or termination proceeding.  A parent or Indian custodian 
27 may request the court to appoint legal counsel for them.  The District Court or Probate 
28 Court, upon a finding that the parent or Indian custodian is indigent, shall appoint and pay 
29 the reasonable costs and expenses of their legal counsel.  The court may, in its discretion, 
30 appoint counsel for the Indian child upon a finding that such appointment is in the best 
31 interest of the Indian child.  
324.  Examination of reports or other documents.  Each party to a foster care placement 
33 or termination of parental rights proceeding under state law involving an Indian child has 
34 the right to examine all reports or other documents filed with the court upon which any 
35 decision with respect to the proceeding may be based.
365.  Remedial services, rehabilitative programs and preventive measures.  A party 
37 seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian 
38 child under chapter 1071 or Title 18-C, Article 5 or 9 shall satisfy the court that active 
39 efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed 
40 to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. 
416.  Foster care placement.  Foster care placement may not be ordered in the absence 
42 of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of 
43 qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the Indian child by the parent or 
44 Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the Indian 1
2
3
4
Page 7 - 131LR1324(01)45 child.  The evidence must show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in 
46 the home and the likelihood that continued custody of the Indian child will result in serious 
47 emotional or physical damage to the particular Indian child who is the subject of the Indian 
48 child custody proceeding.
57.  Termination of parental rights.  Termination of parental rights may not be ordered 
6 in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, 
7 including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the Indian 
8 child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical 
9 damage to the Indian child.  The evidence must show a causal relationship between the 
10 particular conditions in the home and the likelihood that continued custody of the Indian 
11 child will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the particular Indian child who 
12 is the subject of the Indian child custody proceeding.  
13ยง3946. Parental rights; voluntary termination 
141. Consent; record; certification matters; invalid consents.  When a parent or Indian 
15 custodian voluntarily consents to a foster care placement or to termination of parental 
16 rights, this consent is not valid unless executed in writing and recorded before a judge of 
17 the District Court or Probate Court.  The court shall certify in writing that the terms and 
18 consequences of the consent were fully explained in detail and were fully understood by 
19 the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall also certify that either the parent or Indian 
20 custodian fully understood the explanation in English or that it was interpreted into a 
21 language that the parent or Indian custodian understood. Consent given prior to, or within 
22 10 days after, birth of an Indian child is not valid. 
232.  Foster care placement; withdrawal of consent; return of custody.  Any parent 
24 or Indian custodian may withdraw consent to a voluntary foster care placement under the 
25 laws of this State at any time and, upon such withdrawal, the Indian child must be returned 
26 to the parent or Indian custodian. 
273.  Voluntary termination of parental rights or adoptive placement; withdrawal 
28of consent; return of custody.  In any voluntary proceeding for termination of parental 
29 rights to, or adoptive placement of, an Indian child, the consent of the parent or Indian 
30 custodian may be withdrawn for any reason at any time prior to the entry of a final decree 
31 of termination or adoption, as the case may be, and the Indian child must be returned to the 
32 parent or Indian custodian. 
334.  Collateral attack; vacation of decree and return of custody; limitations.  After 
34 the entry of a final decree of adoption of an Indian child in the District Court or Probate 
35 Court in a voluntary proceeding, the parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consent to 
36 the adoption upon the grounds that consent was obtained through fraud or duress and may 
37 petition the court to vacate the decree.  Upon a finding that the consent was obtained 
38 through fraud or duress, the court shall vacate the decree and return the Indian child to the 
39 parent or Indian custodian.  An adoption that has been effective for 2 years or longer may 
40 not be invalidated under the provisions of this subsection. 
41ยง3947. Petition to court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate action upon showing 
42of certain violations 
43 An Indian child who is the subject of an action for foster care placement or termination 
44 of parental rights under the laws of this State, a parent or Indian custodian from whose 1
2
3
4
Page 8 - 131LR1324(01)45 custody the Indian child was removed under the laws of this State and the Indian child's 
46 tribe may petition the District Court to invalidate the action upon a showing that the action 
47 violated any provision of sections 3944 to 3946. 
4ยง3948. Placement of Indian children  
51.  Adoptive placements; preferences.  In an adoptive placement of an Indian child 
6 under the laws of this State, placement preference must be given, in the absence of good 
7 cause to the contrary, in descending order, as listed below:
8 A.  An extended family member of the Indian child;
9 B.  Another member or citizen of the Indian child's tribe;
10 C.  A member or citizen of an Indian tribe in which the Indian child is eligible for 
11 membership or citizenship, but that is not the Indian child's tribe;
12 D.  Another Indian with whom the Indian child has a relationship; or
13 E.  Another Indian from a tribe that is culturally similar to or linguistically connected 
14 to the Indian child's tribe.
152.  Foster care or preadoptive placements; criteria; preferences.  An Indian child 
16 accepted for foster care placement or preadoptive placement must be placed in the least 
17 restrictive setting that most approximates a family and in which that Indian child's special 
18 needs, if any, may be met.  The Indian child must also be placed within reasonable 
19 proximity to that Indian child's home, taking into account any special needs of the child.  
20 In any foster care placement or preadoptive placement, placement preference must be 
21 given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, in descending order, as listed below: 
22 A.  An extended family member of the Indian child;
23 B.  A foster home licensed, approved or specified by the Indian child's tribe; 
24 C.  An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing 
25 authority; or 
26 D.  An institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian 
27 organization that has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs. 
283. Good cause to deviate from placement preferences.  The party seeking departure 
29 from the placement preferences under this section bears the burden of proving by clear and 
30 convincing evidence that there is good cause to depart from the placement preferences.  A 
31 court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences must be made 
32 on the record or in writing and may be based on one or more of the following 
33 considerations:
34 A.  The request of one or both of the Indian child's parents, if they attest that they have 
35 reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference;
36 B.  The request of the Indian child, if the Indian child is of sufficient age and capacity 
37 to understand the decision that is being made;
38 C.  The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a 
39 particular placement;1
2
3
Page 9 - 131LR1324(01)1 D.  The extraordinary physical, mental or emotional needs of the Indian child, such as 
2 specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where 
3 families who meet the placement preferences live; or
4 E.  The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a 
5 diligent search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference 
6 criteria, but none has been located. For purposes of a determination under this 
7 paragraph, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable must 
8 conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in 
9 which the Indian child's parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian 
10 child's parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.
11 A placement may not depart from the preferences under this section based on the 
12 socioeconomic status of any placement relative to another placement.  A placement may 
13 not depart from the preferences based solely on ordinary bonding or attachment that

20 the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian 
21 child, as provided in subsection 2. When appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or 
22 parent must be considered.  When a consenting parent evidences a desire for anonymity, 
23 the court or agency must give weight to such desire in applying the preferences.

35 the contrary, whenever a final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set 
36 aside or the adoptive parents voluntarily consent to the termination of their parental rights 
37 to the Indian child, a biological parent or prior Indian custodian may petition for return of 
38 custody and the court shall grant the petition unless there is a showing, in a proceeding 
39 subject to the provisions of section 3945, that the return of custody is not in the best interests 
40 of the Indian child. 
412.  Removal from foster care placement; procedure.  Whenever an Indian child is 
42 removed from a foster care home or institution for the purpose of further foster care 
43 placement or preadoptive or adoptive placement, the placement must be in accordance with

Page 10 - 131LR1324(01)45 to the parent or Indian custodian from whose custody the Indian child was originally 
46 removed.

13 improperly retained custody after a visit or other temporary relinquishment of custody, the 
14 court shall decline jurisdiction over the petition and shall forthwith return the Indian child 
15 to the child's parent or Indian custodian unless returning the Indian child to the child's 
16 parent or Indian custodian would subject the Indian child to a substantial and immediate 
17 danger or threat of such danger. 
18ยง3952. Higher state or federal standard applicable to protect rights of parent or 
19Indian custodian of Indian child; interpretive guidance
20 In any case in which state or federal law applicable to an Indian child custody 
21 proceeding under state or federal law provides a higher standard of protection to the rights 
22 of the parent or Indian custodian of an Indian child than the rights provided under this 
23 chapter, the state or federal court shall apply the higher state or federal standard. 
24 To the extent any procedure of an Indian child custody proceeding is not addressed in 
25 this Act, 25 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 23 must inform state practice.
