9 treatment and therapeutic intervention, but excluding the diagnosis of organic mental 
10 illness or treatment of any illness by organic therapy, to the extent permitted by the

12 treatment plan for mental illness or emotional disorder, the social worker shall assure,

14 examined by a physician and may take into account the physician's opinion in forming the 
15 psychosocial evaluation.  When a person has been seen by a physician within 3 months prior 
16 to seeking mental health treatment, a telephone conversation between that physician and 
17 the social worker may be held in lieu of the examination required by this subsection. The 
18 medical visit or the telephone conversation shall be documented in the clinical records of 
19 the person.  This requirement shall apply only in cases where there is a presence of 
20 psychopathology.  The board shall define standards by rule, in accordance with the Maine 
21 Administrative Procedure Act, Title 5, chapter 375, for implementation of this subsection.
