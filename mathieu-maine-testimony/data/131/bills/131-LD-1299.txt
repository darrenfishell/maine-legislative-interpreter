2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA §1023, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2021, c. 397, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
45.  Fees.  A bail commissioner is entitled to receive a fee not to exceed $60 for the 
5 charges pursuant to which the defendant is presently in custody, unless the defendant lacks 
6 the present financial ability to pay the fee.  A defendant presently in custody who is 
7 qualified to be released upon personal recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured 
8 appearance bond, whether or not accompanied by one or more conditions of bail that have 
9 been set by a judicial officer, but who in fact lacks the present financial ability to pay a bail 
10 commissioner fee, must nonetheless be released upon personal recognizance or upon 
11 execution of an unsecured appearance bond.  A bail commissioner may not refuse to 
12 examine a person to determine the person's eligibility for bail, set bail, prepare the personal 
13 recognizance or bond or take acknowledgement of the person in custody because the person 
14 in custody lacks the present financial ability to pay a bail commissioner fee.  The bail 
15 commissioner shall submit such forms as the Judicial Department directs to verify the 
16 amount of fees received under this subsection.  The sheriff of the county in which the 
17 defendant is detained may create a fund for the distribution by the sheriff or the sheriff's 
18 designee for the payment in whole or in part of the $60 bail commissioner fee for those 
19 defendants who do not have the financial ability to pay that fee.
20 A bail commissioner fee under this subsection is not a financial condition of release for the 
21 purposes of section 1026, subsection 3, paragraph B‑1.
22Sec. 2.  15 MRSA §1026, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2021, c. 397, §§2 and 3,

28 under subparagraph (9) if the defendant is a participant in a specialty court 
29 docket under Title 4, chapter 8, 8‑A or 8‑B, or any other specialty docket 
30 established by the Judicial Department, or by agreement of the parties as part 
31 of a deferred disposition under Title 17‑A, section 1902; or
32 (b)  A search upon articulable suspicion for possession or use prohibited by a 
33 condition imposed under subparagraph (8) or (9);
