2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §2054, sub-§2, ¶F, as amended by PL 2021, c. 113, §1, is 
3 further amended by amending subparagraph (2) to read:
4 (2)  The municipal officers or a municipal official designated by the municipal

7 flashing auxiliary light mounted in the windshield or on the dashboard at the front 
8 of the vehicle or 2 flashing red or combination red and white auxiliary lights 
9 mounted on the front of the vehicle above the front bumper and below the hood 
10 and one red auxiliary light mounted in the rear window area.  In addition to the 
11 lights authorized under this subparagraph, the municipal officers or municipal 
12 official designated by the municipal officers, with the approval of the fire chief, 
13 may authorize an active member of a municipal or volunteer fire department to use 
14 one red light bar no more than 8 from 10 inches in length up to the width between 
15 the tops of the doors on the roof of the vehicle so that the light is visible to 
16 approaching traffic from the front and the rear of the vehicle.  The light or lights 
17 may be displayed but may be used only while the member is en route to or at the 
18 scene of a fire or other emergency.  A light mounted on the dashboard or in the 
19 windshield must be shielded so that the emitted light does not interfere with the 
20 operator's vision.  The use of lights may be revoked at any time by the fire chief.

23 department to place one red light bar no more than 8 inches in length on the roof of their
