Page 1 - 131LR2322(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA ยง1613 is enacted to read:
3ยง1613.  Self-insurance permitted for certain religious organizations
4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, the Secretary of State may grant an 
5 exemption from any provision of this subchapter for any motor vehicle owned or operated 
6 by a religious organization or its members subject to the following minimum requirements.
71.  Qualifying religious organization.  In order to be eligible to self-insure under this 
8 section, a religious organization must demonstrate with documentation to the satisfaction 
9 of the Secretary of State that:
10 A.  The religious organization has established tenets and faith-based teachings and has 
11 been in existence continuously since December 31, 1950;
12 B.  The religious organization and its members operate 5 or more motor vehicles in this 
13 State that are owned or leased by the religious organization or one of its members;
14 C.  The religious organization and its members hold a common belief in mutual 
15 financial assistance in time of need to the extent that they share in financial obligations 
16 of members who would otherwise not be able to meet their obligations;
17 D.  The religious organization and its members have met all of their responsibilities for 
18 financial responsibility under this subchapter for the 2 years preceding its application 
19 to self-insure under this section;
20 E.  The religious organization is financially solvent and not subject to any actions of 
21 bankruptcy, trusteeship, receivership or any other court proceedings in which the 
22 financial solvency of the religious organization is at issue;
23 F.  The religious organization and its members are not subject to any judgements arising 
24 out of the operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle that have remained 
25 unsatisfied for more than 30 days after final judgement was issued;
26 G.  There are no factors causing the Secretary of State to believe that the religious 
27 organization and its members do not have the financial ability to pay any future 
28 judgements against them; and
29 H.  The religious organization and its members meet any other requirements prescribed 
30 in rules adopted in accordance with this section.
312.  Requirements for self-insurance.  Upon application, the religious organization 
32 shall file with the Secretary of State satisfactory proof using the methods permitted under 
33 section 1605, subsections 3 and 4 that the religious organization meets the following 
34 minimum requirements:
35 A.  For 5 to 10 vehicles, there is a combined single limit of $250,000; and
36 B.  For more than 10 vehicles, there is an increase of $1,000 per motor vehicle up to a 
37 maximum combined single limit of $300,000.
383.  Issuance of certificate of self-insurance.  Upon demonstration that a religious 
39 organization has met the requirements of subsections 1 and 2, the Secretary of State shall 
40 issue a certificate of self-insurance to the religious organization. The certificate of self-
41 insurance serves as evidence of financial responsibility required by section 1605, 
Page 2 - 131LR2322(01)42 subsection 2.  Any member of the religious organization may provide the certificate of self-
43 insurance as evidence of financial responsibility required by section 1605, subsection 2 to 
44 register a motor vehicle owned or operated by that member.
44.  Notice of withdrawal.  A religious organization granted a certificate of self-
5 insurance under this section shall notify the Secretary of State in writing if any member of 
6 the religious organization ceases to be a member within 10 days of that member's departure 
7 or removal from the religious organization.
85.  Termination of self-insurance.  The Secretary of State may:
9 A.  At any time after granting a certificate of self-insurance, terminate the authorization 
10 for self-insurance if the secretary determines that the religious organization no longer 
11 meets the requirements for self-insurance under this section. Notice of the termination 
12 must be provided to the religious organization in writing at least 30 days prior to the 
13 termination of the authorization; and
14 B.  Terminate the authorization for self-insurance if the religious organization or its 
15 members are subject to a judgement arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of 
16 a motor vehicle and that judgement has remained unsatisfied for more than 30 days 
17 after the final judgement was issued. The Secretary of State may hold deposited money 
18 or securities until the judgement is satisfied.
196.  Rules.  The Secretary of State may adopt rules as necessary to implement the 
20 requirements of this section. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical 
21 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
227.  Applicability.  A certificate of self-insurance granted by the Secretary of State 
23 pursuant to this section does not apply to:
24 A.  A motor vehicle with a registered gross weight of 26,001 pounds or more or a motor 
25 vehicle requiring its operator to hold a commercial driver's license;
26 B.  An emergency vehicle;
27 C.  A for-hire transportation vehicle for transporting freight or merchandise;
28 D.  A for-hire transportation vehicle for transporting passengers;
29 E.  A school bus; or
30 F.  A rental vehicle.
31SUMMARY
