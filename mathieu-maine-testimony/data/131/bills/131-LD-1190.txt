3SUBCHAPTER 1-D
4NOTICE OF WORK SCHEDULES
5§620. Definitions
6 As used in this subchapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
7 have the following meanings.
81.  Bureau.  "Bureau" means the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Standards.
92.  Employee.  "Employee" means an individual employed by an employer who is 
10 compensated, at least partially, at an hourly rate.
113.  Employer.  "Employer" means an individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, 
12 corporation, limited liability partnership or company, association or other legal or 
13 commercial entity that employs 250 or more employees worldwide. 
144.  Work schedule.  "Work schedule" means those days and times within a work period 
15 that an employee is required by an employer to perform that employee's duties of 
16 employment for which the employee will receive compensation.
17§620-A. Advance notice of work schedules and changes in work schedules
181.  Initial estimate of minimum hours.  Prior to the start of a new employee's 
19 employment, an employer shall provide the employee with a good faith estimate in writing 
20 of the employee's expected minimum number of scheduled shifts per month, excluding on-
21 call shifts, and the days and hours of those shifts. The new employee may request that the 
22 employer modify this estimated work schedule prior to the start of employment. The 
23 employer shall consider any such request and in its sole discretion may accept or reject the 
24 request. The employer shall notify the new employee of its determination prior to the start 
25 of employment. The estimate does not constitute a contractual offer, and the employer may 
26 not be bound by the estimate.
272.  Two weeks' prior notice of work schedules.  An employer shall provide its 
28 employees with at least 2 weeks' prior notice of their work schedules by doing the following 
29 on a biweekly schedule:
30 A.  Posting the work schedule in a conspicuous place at the workplace that is readily 
31 accessible and visible to all employees; or
32 B.  Transmitting to all employees the work schedule by electronic means.
33 For a new employee, an employer shall provide on the employee's first day of employment 
34 an initial work schedule that runs through the date that the next biweekly schedule for 
35 existing employees is scheduled to be posted or transmitted. Thereafter, the employer shall 
36 include the new employee in an existing biweekly schedule with other employees. For all 
37 employees, the work schedule must include any on-call shifts, as applicable. If the 
38 employer changes the work schedule after it is posted or transmitted, such changes are 
39 subject to the notice and compensation requirements set forth in subsections 3 and 4.
Page 2 - 131LR1989(01)13.  Notice of schedule change.  An employer shall provide an employee notice of any 
2 change to the employee's work schedule that has been posted or transmitted pursuant to 
3 subsection 2. The employer shall provide notice by in-person conversation or by telephone 
4 call and shall provide notice in writing, including by e-mail, text message or other 
5 electronic communication. The notice requirement does not apply to any schedule changes 
6 that the employee requests, such as employee-requested sick leave, time off, shift trades or 
7 additional shifts.
84.  Compensation for schedule changes.  Subject to the exceptions in subsection 5, 
9 an employer shall provide an employee with the following compensation per shift for each 
10 previously scheduled shift that the employer moves to another date or time or cancels and 
11 each previously unscheduled shift that the employer adds to the employee's work schedule:
12 A.  With less than 7 days' notice but 24 hours' or more notice to the employee, one hour 
13 of pay at the employee's regular hourly rate;
14 B.  With less than 24 hours' notice to the employee, 2 hours of pay at the employee's 
15 regular hourly rate for each shift of 4 hours or less; and
16 C.  With less than 24 hours' notice to the employee, 4 hours of pay at the employee's 
17 regular hourly rate for each shift of more than 4 hours.
18 When the employee is required to come to work, the compensation mandated by this 
19 subsection is in addition to the employee's regular pay for working that shift. This 
20 subsection does not apply to on-call shifts.
215.  Exceptions.  The requirements in subsections 3 and 4 do not apply if:
22 A.  Operations cannot begin or continue due to threats to employees or property or a 
23 civil authority's recommendation that operations not begin or continue;
24 B.  Operations cannot begin or continue because utilities fail to supply electricity, water 
25 or gas or there is a failure in the utilities or sewer system;
26 C.  Operations cannot begin or continue due to an act of God or other cause not within 
27 the employer's control, such as a state of emergency declared by the Governor pursuant 
28 to Title 37-B, section 742;
29 D.  Operations cannot begin or continue due to a government shutdown;
30 E.  The employer requires the employee to work overtime in conjunction with a 
31 previously scheduled shift; or
32 F.  The employee trades shifts with another employee or requests from the employer a 
33 change in shift or shifts, hours or work schedule.
346.  Greater advance notice not prohibited.  Nothing in this section may be construed 
35 to prohibit an employer from providing greater advance notice of employees' work 
36 schedules or changes in work schedules than required by this section.
37§620-B. Notice of employee rights
381.  Notice.  The bureau shall publish and make available to employers, in English, 
39 Spanish, French and all languages spoken by more than 5% of the workforce in this State, 
40 a notice suitable for posting by employers in the workplace informing applicants for 
41 employment and employees of their rights under this subchapter. The bureau shall update 
Page 3 - 131LR1989(01)42 this notice on December 1st of any year in which there is a change in the languages spoken 
43 by more than 5% of the workforce of this State.
32.  Posting of notice.  An employer shall post the notice described in subsection 1 in a 
4 conspicuous place at every workplace, job site or other location in this State under the 
5 employer's control frequently visited by its employees. The notice must be posted in 
6 English, Spanish, French and any language spoken by at least 5% of the employees at the 
7 workplace, job site or other location at which it is posted.
8§620-C. Requirements governing retention of records
9 An employer shall retain work schedule and payroll records pertaining to employees 
10 for 3 years and shall allow the bureau access to the records, with appropriate notice and 
11 during business hours, to monitor compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.
12 The bureau must have access to all places of labor subject to this subchapter during 
13 business hours to inspect books and records, interview employees and investigate such 
14 matters necessary or appropriate to determine whether an employer has violated any 
15 provisions of this subchapter. If an employer does not maintain or retain adequate records 
16 documenting compliance with this subchapter or does not allow the bureau reasonable 
17 access to the records, it must be presumed that the employer did not comply with this 
18 subchapter, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
19§620-D. Exercise of rights protected; retaliation prohibited
201.  Rights.  An employer or any other person may not interfere with, restrain or deny 
21 the exercise of or the attempt to exercise any right protected under this subchapter. An 
22 employer or any other person may not discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, suspend or 
23 otherwise take adverse employment action against any employee in retaliation for 
24 exercising rights protected under this subchapter. These rights include but are not limited 
25 to:
26 A.  The right to request a modification to the initial work schedule provided under 
27 section 620-A;
28 B.  The right to inform any person about an employer's alleged violation of this 
29 subchapter;
30 C.  The right to file a complaint with the bureau alleging a violation of this subchapter;
31 D.  The right to cooperate with the bureau or other persons in the investigation or 
32 prosecution of any alleged violation of this subchapter;
33 E.  The right to oppose any policy, practice or act that is unlawful under this subchapter; 
34 and
35 F.  The right to inform any person of the person's rights under this subchapter.
362.  Retaliation.  Taking adverse action against an employee within 90 days of the 
37 employee's exercise of rights protected under this subchapter raises a rebuttable 
38 presumption that the party taking the adverse action did so in retaliation for the exercise of 
39 those rights.
40§620-E. Investigation and complaints
411.  Investigation.  The bureau may investigate possible violations of this subchapter.1
2
Page 4 - 131LR1989(01)12.  Complaints.  An employee or other person may report to the bureau any suspected 
2 violation of this subchapter. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the name and other 
3 identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation are confidential 
4 except that, with the authorization of the employee or person reporting the violation, the 
5 bureau may disclose the employee's or person's name and identifying information as 
6 necessary to enforce this subchapter or for other appropriate purposes.
73.  Bureau discretion.  The bureau's decision to investigate or pursue a violation of 
8 this subchapter is solely at the bureau's discretion. The filing of a report of a suspected 
9 violation by an employee does not create any right of appeal to the bureau by the employee.
10§620-F. Penalties
111.  Civil violation.  An employer that violates any provision of this subchapter commits 
12 a civil violation for which a fine of not more than $50 per day, for each day or portion of a 
13 day that the violation occurred or continued, may be adjudged.
142.  Civil action.  The Attorney General may bring an action to enjoin violations of this 
15 subchapter and for any other available remedy, including, but not limited to, the payment 
16 of lost wages; payment of an additional sum as liquidated damages in an amount not to 
17 exceed lost wages; reinstatement; and reasonable attorney's fees and costs. This action and 
18 an action to prosecute the civil violation pursuant to subsection 1 may be joined in the same 
19 proceeding. Notwithstanding Title 14, section 1602-C, the court shall award interest at a 
20 rate of 10% per annum on all amounts due and unpaid.
21§620-G. No limitation of other rights and remedies
22 This subchapter does not in any way limit the rights and remedies that the law otherwise 
23 provides to employees, including, but not limited to, the rights to be free from wrongful 
24 termination and unlawful discrimination.
25§620-H. Rules
26 The Department of Labor may adopt routine technical rules, as defined in Title 5, 
27 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A, to implement the provisions of this subchapter. The rules must 
28 be consistent with this subchapter and may establish procedures for ensuring fair, efficient 
29 and cost-effective implementation and enforcement of this subchapter, including 
30 procedures for helping to inform employees of their rights under this subchapter and for 
31 monitoring employer compliance.
32§620-I. Report
33 No later than January 1, 2024, January 1, 2025 and January 1, 2026, and no later than 
34 January 1st of every even-numbered year thereafter, the bureau shall provide a written 
35 report regarding this subchapter to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
36 jurisdiction over labor matters. The report must include, but is not limited to, a discussion 
37 of the implementation and enforcement of this subchapter, including the number of 
38 violations and the penalties assessed in the prior year, or prior 2 years starting with the 
39 report due by January 1, 2026. The report may also include recommendations for possible 
40 improvements to this subchapter.
