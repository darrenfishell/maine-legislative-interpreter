3Whereas, lengthy hospital stays and lack of access to services for persons with 
4 intellectual disabilities or autism pose a dire risk to such persons; and
5Whereas, it is essential to address these issues as soon as possible to protect the safety 
6 and well-being of persons with intellectual disabilities or autism; and
7Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
8 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
9 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
10 therefore,
11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
12Sec. 1.  34-B MRSA §5206, sub-§5-A is enacted to read:
135-A.  Emergency departments.  The department shall provide crisis and respite 
14 services for persons with intellectual disabilities or autism to ensure that such a person does 
15 not stay in a hospital emergency department for more than 24 hours after the person has 
16 met the medical criteria for safe discharge.  Crisis beds in a residential facility must be 
17 prioritized for persons who are discharged from hospital emergency departments.  Crisis 
18 and respite services must be available to a residential facility within 4 hours to meet the 
19 needs of a person in crisis.
