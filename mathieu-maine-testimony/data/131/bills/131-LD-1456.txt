Page 1 - 131LR1208(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §711, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2017, c. 199, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
44.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules governing the resolution of pole 
5 attachment disputes and the rates, terms and conditions of joint use. The rules must promote 
6 competition, further the state broadband policy set forth in section 9202‑A and ensure safe, 
7 nondiscriminatory access on just and reasonable terms. The rules must also include a 
8 process for ensuring that a new joint use entity seeking access to the poles, ducts, conduits 
9 or rights-of-way of another joint use entity meets the requirements of subsection 1, 
10 paragraph D. The rules must also include a process by which joint use rates are required to 
11 be reduced or capped and attachment time frames are regulated by the commission to 
12 encourage community broadband systems pursuant to Title 30-A, section 5403, subsection 
13 15. In establishing rates, the commission shall consider various formulas, including, but 
14 not limited to, the formula adopted by the Federal Communications Commission as 
15 codified in 47 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1, Subpart J, as amended.  Rules adopted 
16 or amended  pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
17 chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
18Sec. 2. Public Utilities Commission; study. The Public Utilities Commission, in 
19 consultation with the Maine Connectivity Authority, established in the Maine Revised 
20 Statutes, Title 35-A, section 9404, shall study the methods of promoting municipal 
21 broadband expansion, either through public networks or public-private partnerships, 
22 through a limited-period reduction in utility pole attachment rates for broadband providers 
23 that agree to deliver new high-speed Internet service at affordable rates. The study must 
24 include:
25 1.  An examination of the average wait time for joint use pole owners to approve new 
26 attachments when the attaching entity is a tax-exempt municipality and of ways to decrease 
27 or standardize wait times for attachments;
28 2.  An assessment of what portion of utility poles statewide are in compliance with the 
29 laws and rules requiring preservation of common space on utility poles in the public right-
30 of-way, the ways in which common space on utility poles can be better preserved and the 
31 enforcement mechanisms for pole operators that are out of compliance; and
32 3.  An assessment of the effectiveness of the Public Utilities Commission's enforcement 
33 practices for timely relocation or removal of utility poles that are functionally obsolete, that 
34 are in violation of requirements of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or 
35 that obstruct current or future municipal infrastructure. 
36 By December 6, 2023, the Public Utilities Commission shall submit a report to the 
37 Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology describing the findings of 
38 the study and any recommendations, including proposed legislation, resulting from the 
39 study. After reviewing the report, the joint standing committee may report out legislation 
40 relating to the report to the Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature.
