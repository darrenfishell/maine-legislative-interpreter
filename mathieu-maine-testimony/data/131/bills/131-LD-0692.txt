5 2 for participation in a community confinement monitoring program and recommended by

9 inmate's ability to pay.
10Sec. 2.  30-A MRSA §1659-A, sub-§2, ¶C-1 is enacted to read:

13 administrator has determined that the inmate is not reasonably likely to pose a risk to 
14 the safety of others in the community after the jail administrator has: 
15 (1)  Reviewed the available criminal history record of the inmate to, at a minimum, 
16 identify any patterns of behavior that may indicate the inmate poses a risk to the 
17 safety of others in the community; 
18 (2)  Reviewed and considered any other available evidence that the inmate poses a 
19 risk to the safety of others in the community, including the results of any validated, 
20 evidence-based domestic violence risk assessment that has been completed by law 
21 enforcement in accordance with Title 19-A, section 4114, subsection 6, paragraph 
22 E as part of the criminal case for which the inmate is incarcerated; 
23 (3)  Made a good faith and documented effort to contact the victim of the crime for 
24 which the inmate is incarcerated to inform the victim of the inmate's application to 
25 participate in a community confinement monitoring program and inquire about any 
26 concerns the victim has for the victim's safety or the safety of any member of the 
27 victim's household in connection to the inmate's application to participate in a 
28 community confinement monitoring program;

35 Department of Corrections and must:
36 (a) Include details regarding any concerns provided pursuant to subparagraph 
37 (3) by the victim of the crime for which the inmate is incarcerated, unless the 
38 victim has requested otherwise; 
39 (b) Be signed by the jail administrator; and 
40 (c) Be provided to the sheriff for review prior to the sheriff's approving 
41 assignment of the inmate to a community confinement monitoring program.
Page 2 - 131LR0268(01)1 If a sheriff assigns an inmate serving a sentence for a crime against a family or 
2 household member as defined in Title 19-A, section 4102, subsection 6 to a community 
3 confinement monitoring program, a representative from the county jail to which the 
4 inmate has been sentenced shall make a good faith attempt to notify the victim of that 
5 crime of the assignment at least 10 days prior to the inmate's release from the county 
6 jail;
7SUMMARY
8 This bill sets limitations on when a sheriff may assign an inmate in a county jail who 
9 is serving a sentence for a crime against a family or household member to participate in a 
10 community confinement monitoring program.  It requires the jail administrator to 
11 determine that the inmate is not reasonably likely to pose a risk to the safety of others in 
12 the community.  In making that determination, the jail administrator is required to, among 
13 other things, review and consider the results of an evidence-based risk assessment and the 
14 inmate's criminal history record.  The bill also requires a good faith attempt to notify the 
15 victim of the crime before and after assignment of the inmate to a community confinement 
16 monitoring program.8
