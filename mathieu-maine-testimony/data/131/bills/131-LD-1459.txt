Page 1 - 131LR1127(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA ยง2911 is enacted to read:
3ยง2911.  Effect of modification or dissolution of ex parte order
41.  Costs and attorney's fees.  If the court modifies or dissolves an ex parte order of 
5 attachment on trustee process in response to a motion by any person having an interest in 
6 goods or credits that have been attached, the court shall order the plaintiff to pay to the 
7 moving party:
8 A.  The costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the moving party for the 
9 motion; and
10 B.  Interest, at a rate equivalent to the rate of post-judgment interest under section 
11 1602-C, subsection 1, paragraph B, on the value of the amount of cash, if any, that was 
12 attached on trustee process pursuant to the ex parte order but that is no longer subject 
13 to attachment due to the modification or dissolution of that order.  Interest under this 
14 paragraph accrues from and after the date of entry of the ex parte order of attachment 
15 on trustee process until the date that the order under this paragraph is fully satisfied.  
16 On petition of the plaintiff and on a showing of good cause, the court may order that 
17 interest awarded under this paragraph be fully or partially waived.
182.  Joint and several liability.  If 2 or more plaintiffs joined in the filing of a motion 
19 for an ex parte order of attachment on trustee process, those plaintiffs are jointly and 
20 severally liable for any award of costs, reasonable attorney's fees and interest under 
21 subsection 1.
223.  Prima facie evidence.  An order modifying or dissolving an ex parte order of 
23 attachment on trustee process in response to a motion by any person having an interest in 
24 goods or credits that have been attached is prima facie evidence of abuse of process by the 
25 plaintiff or plaintiffs that filed the motion for the ex parte order of attachment on trustee 
26 process.
274.  Trustee process on counterclaim, cross-claim or 3rd-party complaint.  If an ex 
28 parte order for attachment on trustee process was obtained by a party bringing a 
29 counterclaim, a cross-claim or a 3rd-party complaint, the word "plaintiff" as used in this 
30 section refers to the party to the action that obtained the ex parte order for attachment on 
31 trustee process and the word "defendant" as used in this section refers to the party to the 
32 action whose property was attached.
33Sec. 2.  14 MRSA ยง4103 is enacted to read:
34ยง4103.  Effect of modification or dissolution of ex parte order
351.  Costs and attorney's fees.  If the court modifies or dissolves an ex parte order of 
36 attachment in response to a motion by any person having an interest in property that has 
37 been attached, the court shall order the plaintiff to pay to the moving party:
38 A.  The costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the moving party for the 
39 motion; and
40 B. Interest, at a rate equivalent to the rate of post-judgment interest under section 
41 1602-C, subsection 1, paragraph B, on the value of the amount of cash, if any, that was 
42 attached pursuant to the ex parte order but that is no longer subject to attachment due 
Page 2 - 131LR1127(01)43 to the modification or dissolution of that order.  Interest under this paragraph accrues 
44 from and after the date of entry of the ex parte order of attachment until the date that 
45 the order under this paragraph is fully satisfied.  On petition of the plaintiff and on a 
46 showing of good cause, the court may order that interest awarded under this paragraph 
47 be fully or partially waived.
62.  Joint and several liability.  If 2 or more plaintiffs joined in the filing of the motion 
7 for an ex parte order of attachment, those plaintiffs are jointly and severally liable for any 
8 award of costs, reasonable attorney's fees and interest under subsection 1.
93.  Prima facie evidence.  An order modifying or dissolving an ex parte order of 
10 attachment in response to a motion by any person having an interest in property that has 
11 been attached is prima facie evidence of abuse of process by the plaintiff or plaintiffs that 
12 filed the motion for the ex parte order of attachment.
13SUMMARY
14 This bill provides that plaintiffs that obtain an ex parte order of attachment or an ex 
15 parte order of attachment on trustee process are jointly and severally liable for the court 
16 costs and reasonable attorney's fees of a person having an interest in goods or credits that 
17 have been attached and that successfully move for modification or dissolution of the ex 
18 parte order.  If any amount of cash was attached pursuant to the ex parte order but is no 
19 longer subject to attachment due to the modification or dissolution of that order, the 
20 plaintiffs are also jointly and severally liable for interest, calculated at a rate equivalent to 
21 the general post-judgment interest rate, upon the value of that cash from the date that the 
22 ex parte order of attachment or attachment on trustee process was granted and through the 
23 date that the award of interest is fully satisfied.  
24 The bill also provides that an order modifying or dissolving an ex parte order of 
25 attachment or an ex parte order of attachment on trustee process constitutes prima facie 
26 evidence of the common law tort of abuse of process.1
