2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §4318-A, first ¶, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 232, §8, is 
3 amended to read:
4 Beginning January 1, 2019, a A carrier offering a health plan in this State shall 
5 establish, at a minimum, for all small group health plans as defined in section 2808‑B, 
6 subsection 1, paragraph G compatible with a health savings account authorized under 
7 federal law, a health plan design in which enrollees are directly incentivized to shop for 
8 low-cost, high-quality participating providers for comparable health care services.  
9 Incentives may include, but are not limited to, cash payments, gift cards or credits or 
10 reductions of premiums, copayments or deductibles.  A small group health plan design 
11 created under this section must remain available to enrollees for at least 2 consecutive 
12 years, except that any changes made to the program after 2 years, including, but not limited 
13 to, ending the incentive, may not be construed as a change to the small group health plan 
14 design for the purpose of guaranteed renewability under section 2808‑B, subsection 4 or 
15 section 2850‑B. Incentives must be equal to or greater than 25% of the difference between 
16 the price of the service from the provider selected and the statewide average for the same 
17 covered health care service based on data reported on the publicly accessible health care 
18 costs website of the Maine Health Data Organization.  A carrier may use the average price 
19 paid to a network provider for the covered comparable health care service under the 
20 enrollee’s health plan in lieu of the statewide average price on the Maine Health Data 
21 Organization’s publicly accessible website as long as the carrier uses a reasonable method 
22 to calculate the average price paid. A multiple-employer welfare arrangement is not 
23 considered a carrier for the purposes of this section.
24Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §4318-A, sub-§1, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 232, §8, is 
25 amended to read:

29 (2)  Radiology and imaging services;
30 (3)  Laboratory services; and
31 (4)  Infusion therapy services. ; and
32 (5)  Surgical procedures.
33Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §4318-A, sub-§8, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 232, §8, is 
34 repealed.
35Sec. 4.  24-A MRSA §4318-B, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 232, §9, is 
36 amended to read:
371.  Services from out-of-network provider; lower prices.  Beginning January 1, 
38 2019, if  If an enrollee covered under a health plan  other than a health maintenance 
39 organization plan elects to obtain a covered comparable health care service as defined in 
40 section 4318‑A, subsection 1, paragraph A from an out-of-network provider at a price that 
41 is the same or less than the statewide average for the same covered health care service based 
42 on data reported on the publicly accessible health care costs website of the Maine Health 
Page 2 - 131LR1301(01)43 Data Organization, the carrier shall allow the enrollee to obtain the service from the out-
44 of-network provider at the provider's charge and, upon request by the enrollee, shall apply 
45 the payments made by the enrollee for that comparable health care service toward the 
46 enrollee's deductible and out-of-pocket maximum as specified in the enrollee's health plan 
47 as if the health care services had been provided by an in-network provider.  A carrier may 
48 use the average price paid to a network provider for the covered comparable health care 
49 service under the enrollee's health plan in lieu of the statewide average price on the Maine 
50 Health Data Organization's publicly accessible website as long as the carrier uses a 
51 reasonable method to calculate the average price paid and the information is available to 
52 enrollees through a website accessible to the enrollee and a toll-free telephone number that 
53 provide, at a minimum, information relating to comparable health care services.  The 
54 enrollee is responsible for demonstrating to the carrier that payments made by the enrollee 
55 to the out-of-network provider should be applied toward the enrollee's deductible or out-
56 of-pocket maximum pursuant to this section.  The carrier shall provide a downloadable or 
57 interactive online form to the enrollee for the purpose of making such a demonstration and 
58 may require that copies of bills and proof of payment be submitted by the enrollee.  For the 
59 purposes of this section, "out-of-network provider" means a provider located in 
60 Massachusetts, New Hampshire or this State that is enrolled in the MaineCare program and 
61 participates in Medicare.
20Sec. 5.  24-A MRSA §4318-B, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 232, §9, is 
21 repealed.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill makes the following changes to the law relating to the comparable health care 
24 incentive program. 
25 1.  It removes the requirement that the small group health plan design be compatible 
26 with a health savings account. 
27 2.  It requires that the incentives be equal to or greater than 25% of the difference 
28 between the price of the service from the provider selected and the statewide average for 
29 the same covered health care service based on data reported on the publicly accessible 
30 health care costs website of the Maine Health Data Organization.  
31 3.  It adds surgical procedures to the categories of health care services included in the 
32 definition of "comparable health care service."
33 4.  It repeals the sunset date of the comparable health care service incentive program, 
34 which is January 1, 2024. 
35 Under current law, if an enrollee covered under a health plan other than a health 
36 maintenance organization plan elects to obtain a covered comparable health care service 
37 from an out-of-network provider at a price that is the same or less than the statewide 
38 average for the same covered health care service, the carrier is required to allow the enrollee 
39 to obtain the service from the out-of-network provider at the provider's charge and, upon 
40 request by the enrollee, to apply the payments made by the enrollee for that comparable 
41 health care service toward the enrollee's deductible and out-of-pocket maximum as 
42 specified in the enrollee's health plan as if the health care services had been provided by an 
43 in-network provider.  This bill removes the exception that the provision does not apply to 
44 a health maintenance organization plan and the limitation defining an out-of-network 1
