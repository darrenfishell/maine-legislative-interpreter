Page 1 - 131LR1174(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง8202, sub-ยง2, as amended by PL 2009, c. 486, ยง1, is further 
3 amended to read:
42.  Tuition; room and board; funding.  Students from this State may attend the school 
5 free of tuition charges and free of the cost of room and board.  Additional funding for 
6 students from this State may be provided within amounts appropriated for that purpose as 
7 follows.
8 A.  The amount must be paid in 4 equal quarterly payments during the year of 
9 attendance.  The first payment must be made by July 31st.  The amount of tuition and 
10 other costs paid for all students is limited to the amount appropriated for this purpose.  
11 To be eligible for state funding under this paragraph, a student must have resided in 
12 Maine with a parent, other relative or guardian for at least 6 months immediately 
13 preceding application to the school.
14 B.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, effective July 1, 1996  and to the 
15 extent funds are not appropriated for this purpose, the student or the student's parent or 
16 guardian shall pay to the school the cost of room and board for the school year.  In the 
17 case of financial need, the State shall pay to the school the difference between the cost 
18 of room and board and the student's or the student's family's ability to pay that cost.  
19 The board of trustees shall adopt rules governing the determination of financial need 
20 and the cost and schedule of payment of room and board under this paragraph.  The 
21 determination of financial need must be based on a nationally recognized public or 
22 private school financial needs assessment system.  A student may use scholarship funds 
23 in place of payment for all or part of the cost of room and board and any other fees or 
24 expenses incurred as a result of that student's enrollment at the school.
