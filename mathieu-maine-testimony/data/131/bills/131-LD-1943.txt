Page 1 - 131LR0483(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง3210-I, sub-ยง3-A is enacted to read:
33-A.  Requests for proposals; additional generation capacity.  If, after selecting 
4 contracts under subsections 2 and 3, more than 5% of capacity of the selected transmission 
5 proposal would not be used by the selected generation proposal, the commission shall 
6 approve an additional contract or contracts to ensure that the selected transmission proposal 
7 is fully used in accordance with this section.  The commission shall:
8 A.  Approve a contract for additional generation capacity that is no less than 750,000 
9 megawatt-hours per year;
10 B.  Approve a contract as long as the commission determines that the contract meets 
11 the requirements of subsection 2, paragraph C and is in the public interest; and
12 C.  Consider bids in any previous request for proposals issued under subsection 3 by:
13 (1)  Providing those bidders with an opportunity to submit updated proposals that 
14 account for any previous contract awards in order to ensure that proposals are 
15 expeditiously received and most cost-effective in consideration of those previous 
16 awards; and
17 (2)  Applying evaluation criteria set forth in this subsection, except that the 
18 commission must give greatest preference to proposals that:
19 (a)  Demonstrate the greatest likelihood of ensuring the success of the program 
20 by contributing to the likelihood of successful completion of the transmission 
21 proposal selected under subsection 2 and other generation proposals selected 
22 under subsection 3;
23 (b)  Are submitted by a bidder that demonstrates significant experience in the 
24 successful completion of renewable energy projects similar to that proposal; 
25 and
26 (c)  Complements the proposals previously selected under subsection 3, but 
27 mitigates overall risk to the success of the program by diversifying bidder 
28 selection and economic development opportunities in northern Maine.
29 If a selected proposal under this subsection is unable, at any time after selection and before 
30 commercial operation, to fulfill the obligations of the contract, the commission may 
31 consider other proposals received under this subsection or subsection 3 to ensure the 
32 successful implementation of the program. If the commission finds that a proposal or 
33 proposals, whether in whole or in part, received under this subsection or subsection 3 would 
34 support the overall successful implementation of the program, the commission shall 
35 approve and order a contract or contracts accordingly.
36 The commission shall make every effort to ensure that the competitive bidding process 
37 directed by this subsection results in the approval of contracts pursuant to this subsection 
38 no later than December 1, 2023.  If the commission determines that no contract satisfies 
39 these requirements, the commission shall report that determination to the joint standing 
40 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and utilities matters.
Page 2 - 131LR0483(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to approve an additional contract or 
3 contracts to ensure that the selected transmission proposal under the Northern Maine 
4 Renewable Energy Development Program is fully used if more than 5% of the capacity of 
5 the selected transmission proposal is not being used under other generation contracts.2
