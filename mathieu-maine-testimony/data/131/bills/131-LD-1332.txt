14 evidence of work search efforts in a manner and form as prescribed by the Department of

17 for the week or weeks for which no documentation was provided unless the department 
18 determines there is good cause for the individual's failure to comply with this requirement; .
19 A.  In order for an individual to meet the work search requirements under this section,
