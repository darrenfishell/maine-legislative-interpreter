7 added lamp that is a compact fluorescent lamp with a pin base type or that is a linear 
8 fluorescent lamp. This subsection does not apply to the following:
9 A.  A mercury-added lamp that is designed and marketed exclusively for image capture 
10 and projection, including:
11 (1) Photocopying;
12 (2) Printing, directly or in preprocessing;
13 (3) Lithography;
14 (4) Film or video projection; and
15 (5) Holography;
16 B.  A mercury-added lamp that has a high proportion of ultraviolet light emission and 
17 that:
18 (1) Has ultraviolet power greater than 2 milliwatts per kilolumen;
19 (2) Is designed for germicidal use, including the destruction of deoxyribonucleic 
20 acid, or DNA, that emits a peak radiation of approximately 253.7 nanometers;
21 (3) Is designed and marketed exclusively for disinfection or fly trapping and from 
22 which either the radiation power emitted between 250 and 315 nanometers 
23 represents at least 5% of or the radiation power emitted between 315 and 400 
24 nanometers represents at least 20% of the total radiation power emitted between 
25 250 and 800 nanometers;
26 (4) Is designed and marketed exclusively for the generation of ozone, the primary 
27 purpose of which is to emit radiation at approximately 185.1 nanometers;
28 (5) Is designed and marketed exclusively for coral zooxanthellae symbiosis and

39 E.  A mercury-added lamp designed and marketed exclusively for spectroscopy and 
40 photometric applications, such as ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, molecular 
Page 2 - 131LR0986(01)41 spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, nondispersive infrared spectroscopy, 
42 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, medical analysis, ellipsometry, layer 
43 thickness measurement, process monitoring or environmental monitoring; 
4 F.  A mercury-added lamp designed and marketed exclusively for use by academic and 
5 research institutions for conducting research projects and experiments; or
6 G. A mercury-added lamp that is a compact fluorescent lamp and that is used to replace 
7 a lamp in a motor vehicle that was manufactured on or before January 1, 2020.
8 The department periodically may inspect distributors or retailers in order to determine 
9 compliance with the provisions of this subsection. The department shall investigate
