3ยง710.  Safety and interconnectivity requirements of construction projects
41. Safety and interconnectivity requirements for construction projects over 
5$500,000.  A construction project under this chapter, the design of which is commenced on 
6 or after January 1, 2024 and the cost of which is $500,000 or more, must:
7 A. Identify locations on state highways and state aid highways impacted by the 
8 construction project that:
9 (1) Do not have a complete sidewalk or shared-use path that meets the requirements 
10 of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; 
11 (2) Do not have bicycle facilities in the form of a bicycle lane or adjacent parallel 
12 trail or shared-use path; 
13 (3) Have a sidewalk, bicycle lane, adjacent parallel trail or shared-use path within 
14 a population center with a posted speed limit of over 30 miles per hour and no 
15 buffer or physical separation from motor vehicle traffic and a pedestrian, bicyclist 
16 or other user not in a motor vehicle; and
17 (4) Have a design that impedes the ability of a motorist to see a crossing pedestrian, 
18 bicyclist or other user not in a motor vehicle with sufficient time to stop within the 
19 posted speed limit and roadway configuration;
20 B. Consult with municipalities in which the project is being constructed to:
21 (1) Confirm existing or planned connections with other transportation 
22 infrastructure along or across the construction project; 
23 (2) Identify any connections of the construction project to existing and planned 
24 public transportation services, including commuter and passenger rail and airports; 
25 (3) Identify the existing and planned facility types for public transportation services 
26 under subparagraph (2) within the municipality; and
27 (4) Consider use of speed management techniques to minimize crash exposure and 
28 severity on a roadway located within the construction project;
29 C. In order to maintain a safe transportation system and to eliminate serious and fatal 
30 motor vehicle crashes, adjust a posted speed limit on a roadway located within the 
31 construction project to a lower speed with appropriate modifications to roadway design 
32 and management operations to achieve the desired operating speed in a location where 
33 the modifications align with local plans or ordinances and in particular that presents a 
34 higher possibility of serious injury or a fatal motor vehicle crash occurring based upon 
35 land use, observed crash data, crash potential or roadway characteristics that are likely 
36 to increase crash exposure; and
37 D. Plan, design and construct facilities providing context-sensitive solutions that 
38 contribute to transportation network connectivity and safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, 
39 other users not in a motor vehicle and persons accessing public transportation and other 
40 modal transportation connections, including sidewalks or shared-use paths that meet 
41 the requirements of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, bicycle 
Page 2 - 131LR1794(01)42 facilities and crossings of the project as needed to integrate a state highway or state aid 
43 highway into the local transportation system.
32. Emergency work.  A construction project to perform repairs or construction 
4 required to reopen a state highway or state aid highway due to a natural disaster or other 
5 emergency is exempt from the requirements of this section.
63. Ongoing maintenance.  Ongoing maintenance of facilities and systems of a 
7 construction project under this section after construction is completed must be conducted 
8 as provided under this chapter.
9Sec. 2.  23 MRSA ยง711 is enacted to read:
10ยง711.  Priorities for state funding
111. Priority for funding. The department shall prioritize for funding under this Title a 
12 transportation construction project or other recipient that meets the criteria of subsection 2.
132. Criteria. The criteria for priority of funding under subsection 1 include that the 
14 project:
15 A. Provides street access for all transportation system users, including pedestrians, 
16 bicyclists, other users not in a motor vehicle and users of public transportation;
17 B. Encourages mixed land uses by constructing residences, offices, schools, parks, 
18 shops, restaurants and other types of land uses near each other;
19 C. Encourages infill development by building on empty or underutilized lots that have 
20 access to public water, sewer and emergency services;
21 D. Facilitates access to affordable or dense housing;
22 E. Encourages walkable neighborhoods; 
23 F. Preserves open space, wetlands, parks, farms and woodlands; and
24 G. Encourages robust community and public participation, opinions and input in the 
25 type and scope of the transportation construction or other project.
