4Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
5Sec. 1.  Authorization of bonds.  The Treasurer of State is authorized, under the 
6 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an 
7 amount not exceeding $4,000,000 for the purposes described in section 5 of this Act.  The 
8 bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may not run for a 
9 period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
10Sec. 2.  Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer of State 
11 shall ensure that an account of each bond is kept showing the number of the bond, the name 
12 of the successful bidder to whom sold, the amount received for the bond, the date of sale 
13 and the date when payable.
14Sec. 3.  Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated.  The Treasurer of State 
15 may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may be 
16 loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 
17 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 
18 upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set 
19 forth in this Act.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project 
20 in this Act lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of 
21 general obligation bonds.
22Sec. 4.  Interest and debt retirement.  The Treasurer of State shall pay interest 
23 due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Act and all sums coming due for payment 
24 of bonds at maturity.
25Sec. 5.  Disbursement of bond proceeds from General Fund bond issue.  The 
26 proceeds of the sale of the bonds authorized under this Act must be expended as designated
