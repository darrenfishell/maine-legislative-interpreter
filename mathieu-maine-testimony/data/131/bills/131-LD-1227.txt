Page 1 - 131LR2261(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  2 MRSA §9, sub-§3, ¶I, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 656, Pt. C, §1, is amended 
3 to read:
4 I.  Monitor energy transmission capacity planning and policy affecting this State and 
5 the regulatory approval process for the development of energy infrastructure pursuant 
6 to Title 35‑A, section 122 and make recommendations to the Governor and the 
7 Legislature as necessary for changes to the relevant laws and rules to facilitate energy 
8 infrastructure planning and development; and
9Sec. 2.  2 MRSA §9, sub-§3, ¶J, as amended by PL 2011, c. 55, §2, is further 
10 amended to read:
11 J.  Take action as necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of the state energy 
12 plan prepared pursuant to paragraph C including lowering the total cost of energy to 
13 consumers in this State. ; and
14Sec. 3.  2 MRSA §9, sub-§3, ¶K is enacted to read:
15 K.  Create and maintain a publicly accessible database of fully permitted or constructed 
16 energy facilities that may be used to identify land use and other energy trends. For 
17 purposes of this paragraph, "energy facility" means a facility constructed and operated 
18 for the purpose of generating energy for sale and that is connected to the electric 
19 transmission and distribution utility system within the State. The database must include 
20 key characteristics, including, but not limited to, geospatial data. The director may 
21 collect the data from state permitting agencies, the Public Utilities Commission and 
22 other relevant entities and may determine the format and schedule of data collection.
23Sec. 4. Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to plan for 
24pilot program to study feasibility of dual-use projects.  The Department of 
25 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, referred to in this section as "the department," in 
26 collaboration with the Governor's Energy Office, the Public Utilities Commission and other 
27 state agencies and stakeholders, including research institutions, shall develop a plan to 
28 implement a dual-use energy pilot program, referred to in this section as "the pilot program 
29 plan," to test and study the efficacy and potential benefits of innovative solar energy 
30 systems that are connected to the electric transmission and distribution utility system and 
31 are located on natural and developed areas, including, but not limited to, farmland that is 
32 maintained in active agricultural or horticultural use, parking lots and aquatic sites. For 
33 purposes of this section, "dual-use project" means a mixed-use system combining use of 
34 land or aquatic sites with solar energy production.
35 The pilot program plan must:
36 1. Identify potential dual-use projects that collectively have a total capacity of 30 
37 megawatts, with at least 20 megawatts reserved for dual-use projects on agricultural land, 
38 and that may warrant inclusion in a pilot program based on criteria including but not limited 
39 to emerging or potential commercial viability, potential applicability to the State, and 
40 potential to contribute meaningfully and cost-effectively to achievement of the goals 
41 established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3210, subsection 1-A;
Page 2 - 131LR2261(01)1 2. Identify and include eligibility criteria for dual-use projects to be included in the 
2 pilot program, including, but not limited to, the continuation of agricultural or horticultural 
3 uses of the affected land;
4 3. Identify if financial incentives, location-based incentives or other incentives to dual-
5 use projects that would be considered for inclusion in the pilot program would be necessary, 
6 including mechanisms to minimize the cost of the pilot program to electric ratepayers in 
7 the State;
8 4. Ensure all approved agricultural dual-use projects permit the department to conduct 
9 or direct research on compatible crops, grazing operations and other agricultural or 
10 horticultural uses of the land to determine best practices for dual-use projects.  The 
11 determination of best practices must consider both the duration of uses of the land and the 
12 energy production of the solar energy system;
13 5. Include an application process for landowners seeking to be included in the pilot 
14 program, including landowners who have already deployed or are planning to deploy solar 
15 energy systems;  
16 6. Examine benefits of dual-use project applications to individual landowners, the 
17 electric transmission and distribution utility system and the State's ability to meet clean 
18 energy and climate goals; and
19 7. Include an evaluation process and selection criteria that may result in the approval 
20 of dual-use projects of varying sizes, in different geographic locations, that involve diverse 
21 types of sites, including agricultural sites, and, if applicable, minimize negative impacts to 
22 farmland and the environment, and ensure appropriate innovation as well as planning for 
23 technical and financial feasibility, including interconnection with the electric transmission 
24 and distribution utility system.
25 The department in coordination with the Governor's Energy Office shall submit a report 
26 with a plan for implementing the pilot program to the joint standing committees of the 
27 Legislature having jurisdiction over agriculture, conservation and forestry matters; energy 
28 and utilities matters; and environment and natural resources matters no later than February 
29 1, 2025 and each joint standing committee may submit legislation relating to the subject 
30 matter of the report to the First Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.
31SUMMARY
32 This bill directs the Governor's Energy Office to create and maintain a publicly 
33 accessible database of fully permitted or constructed energy facilities using renewable 
34 resources that may be used to identify land use trends.
35 The bill requires the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, in 
36 collaboration with the Governor's Energy Office and the Public Utilities Commission and 
37 other state agencies, stakeholders and research institutions, to develop a plan to implement 
38 a dual-use energy pilot program and requires the department to submit a report with a plan 
39 for implementing a pilot program to the joint standing committees of the Legislature having 
40 jurisdiction over agriculture, conservation and forestry matters; energy and utilities matters; 
41 and environment and natural resources matters no later than February 1, 2025.  Each joint 
42 standing committee is authorized to submit a bill relating to the subject matter of the report
