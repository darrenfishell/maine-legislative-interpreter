25Sec. 10.  35-A MRSA §10109, sub-§3-B is enacted to read:
263-B.  Ceiling on energy efficiency spending.  There is established a ceiling on energy 
27 efficiency spending from the trust fund equal to $5 per carbon dioxide allowance. Until 
28 that price ceiling is adjusted or removed, only the first $5 of each carbon dioxide allowance 
29 sold and deposited in the trust fund may be awarded to or directed to qualified projects for 
30 purposes of energy efficiency improvements.
31 A.  The trust shall transfer funds, to the extent funds are available, to the commission 
32 each year during fiscal years 2023-24 and 2024-25 in accordance with this subsection 
33 to be used by the commission for disbursements to affected customers. An affected 
34 customer who uses the entire disbursement received by that customer toward an 
35 efficiency measure approved by the trust in the fiscal year in which it is received must 
36 receive $1 of assistance from the trust for every $3 of the disbursement plus any 
37 additional customer funds that are applied by the affected customer toward the cost of 
38 the approved efficiency measure as long as the total of assistance from the trust and the 
39 disbursement allocated by the commission under this subsection for that customer for 
40 that fiscal year does not exceed 65% of the total measure cost.
Page 3 - 131LR0775(01)1 For the purposes of this subsection, "affected customer" means a customer who is not 
2 primarily in the business of selling electricity, is receiving service at a transmission or 
3 subtransmission voltage level as defined in section 10110, subsection 6 within the 
4 electrical utility transmission system administered by an independent system operator 
5 of the New England bulk power system or a successor organization and is an 
6 energy-intensive manufacturer, as defined in reports prepared by the United States 
7 Energy Information Administration. The commission may also determine that a 
8 manufacturer not defined as an energy-intensive manufacturer in reports prepared by 
9 the United States Energy Information Administration is an affected customer if that 
10 manufacturer meets the other requirements of the definition under this subsection.
11 The commission shall direct funds to be dispersed quarterly during fiscal years 2023-24 
12 and 2024-25 for the benefit of affected customers in proportion to their retail purchase 
13 of electricity as measured in kilowatt-hours for the prior calendar year. The total 
14 amount to be disbursed from the fund, to the extent those funds are available, must be 
15 $3,000,000 in fiscal year 2023-24 and $3,000,000 in fiscal year 2024-25.
16 During fiscal years 2023-24 and 2024-25, an affected customer who receives a 
17 disbursement under this subsection is not eligible to receive financial or other 
18 assistance from the trust fund established in this section except as allowed under this 
19 subsection. This ineligibility does not apply to any trust program opportunity notices 
20 issued before July 1, 2016 or to any affected customer that elects in writing to the 
21 commission prior to December 1, 2023 to not receive a disbursement under this 
22 subsection for the full period of fiscal years 2023-24 and 2024-25. The commission 
23 shall reduce the total amount to be disbursed as necessary to reflect the share of load 
24 represented by affected customers electing to opt out.
25 B.  In fiscal years 2023-24 and 2024-25, the trust shall transfer to the commission for 
26 distribution to Maine-based energy-intensive businesses, other than affected 
27 customers, any revenue received that is in excess of the sum of:
28 (1)  The first $5 of each carbon dioxide allowance sold; and
29 (2)  The transfer, in accordance with paragraph A, to the commission of $3,000,000 
30 to be used for disbursements to affected customers.
31 C.  Beginning with fiscal year 2025-26:
32 (1)  Revenue received by the trust from carbon dioxide allowances valued above 
33 $5 up to a limit of $3,000,000 per year must be transferred to the commission for 
34 use by the commission for the benefit of affected customers in accordance with 
35 paragraph A; and 
36 (2)  Revenue received by the trust in excess of the amount transferred in accordance 
37 with subparagraph (1) must be transferred to the commission for distribution to 
38 Maine-based energy-intensive businesses, other than affected customers, up to an 
39 additional $3,000,000 annually.
40 Any funds received by the trust in excess of a value of $5 per carbon dioxide allowance 
41 plus $6,000,000 must be transferred to the commission for distribution to electric 
42 ratepayers in a manner designed to provide the greatest benefit to the state economy as 
43 determined by the commission.
Page 4 - 131LR0775(01)1 The commission may adopt rules to implement this subsection. Rules adopted under this 
2 subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
3Sec. 11.  35-A MRSA §10109, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2021, c. 716, §2, is 
4 further amended to read:
54.  Expenditures; projects.  Except for transfers required under subsection 3-B and 
6 other costs authorized in accordance with this chapter, funds in the trust fund must be 
7 expended in accordance with this subsection.
8 A.  Trust funds must be allocated for measures, investments, loans, technical assistance 
9 and arrangements that reduce electricity consumption, increase energy efficiency or 
10 reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs at commercial or industrial 
11 facilities and for investment in measures that lower residential heating energy demand 
12 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The measures that lower residential heating 
13 demand must be fuel-neutral and may include, but are not limited to, energy efficiency 
14 improvements to residential buildings, energy storage systems and upgrades to 
15 efficient heating systems that will reduce residential energy costs and greenhouse gas 
16 emissions, as determined by the board.  The trust shall ensure that measures to reduce 
17 the cost of residential heating are available for low-income households as defined by 
18 the trust.  When promoting electricity cost and consumption reduction, the trust may 
19 consider measures at commercial and industrial facilities that also lower peak capacity 
20 demand, including energy storage systems.  Subject to the apportionment pursuant to 
21 this subsection, the trust shall fund conservation programs that give priority to 
22 measures with the highest benefit-to-cost ratio, as long as cost-effective collateral 
23 efficiency opportunities are not lost, and that:
24 (1)  Reliably reduce greenhouse gas production and heating energy costs by fossil 
25 fuel combustion in the State at the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per unit 
26 of emissions; or
27 (2)  Reliably increase the efficiency with which energy in the State is consumed at 
28 the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per unit of energy saved.
29 B.  Expenditures from the trust fund relating to conservation of electricity and 
30 mitigation or reduction of greenhouse gases must be made predominantly on the basis 
31 of a competitive bid process for long-term contracts, subject to rules adopted by the 
32 board under section 10105.  Rules adopted by the board to implement the competitive 
33 bid process under this paragraph may not include an avoided cost methodology for 
34 compensating successful bidders.  Bidders may propose contracts designed to produce 
35 greenhouse gas savings or electricity conservation savings, or both, on a unit cost basis.  
36 Contracts must be commercially reasonable and may require liquidated damages to 
37 ensure performance.  Contracts must provide sufficient certainty of payment to enable 
38 commercial financing of the conservation measure purchased and its installation.
39 C.  The board may target bid competitions in areas or to participants as they consider 
40 necessary, as long as the requirements of paragraph A are satisfied.
41 D.  Community-based renewable energy projects, as defined in section 3602, 
42 subsection 1, may apply for funding from the trust to the extent they are eligible under 
43 paragraph A.
Page 5 - 131LR0775(01)1 E.  The size of a project funded by the trust fund is not limited as long as funds are 
2 awarded to maximize energy efficiency and support greenhouse gas reductions and to 
3 fully implement the triennial plan.
4 F.  No more than $800,000 of trust fund receipts in any one year may be used for the 
5 costs of administering the trust fund pursuant to this section. The limit on 
6 administrative costs established in this paragraph does not apply to the following costs 
7 that may be funded by the trust fund:
8 (1)  Costs of the Department of Environmental Protection for participating in the 
9 regional organization as defined in Title 38, section 580‑A, subsection 20 and for 
10 administering the allowance auction under Title 38, chapter 3‑B; and
11 (2)  Costs of the Attorney General for activities pertaining to the tracking and 
12 monitoring of allowance trading activity and managing and evaluating the trust's 
13 funding of conservation programs.
14 G.  In order to minimize administrative costs and maximize program participation and 
15 effectiveness, the trustees shall, to the greatest extent feasible, coordinate the delivery 
16 of and make complementary the energy efficiency programs under this section and 
17 other programs under this chapter.
18 H.  The trust shall consider delivery of efficiency programs by means of contracts with 
19 service providers that participate in competitive bid processes for reducing energy 
20 consumption within individual market segments or for particular end uses.
21 I.  A trade association aggregator is eligible to participate in competitive bid processes 
22 under this subsection.
23 J.  Trust fund receipts must, upon request by the Department of Environmental 
24 Protection, fund research approved by the Department of Environmental Protection in 
25 an amount of up to $100,000 per year to develop new categories for carbon dioxide 
26 emissions offset projects, as defined in Title 38, section 580‑A, subsection 6, that are 
27 located in the State.  Expenditures on research pursuant to this paragraph are not 
28 considered administrative costs under paragraph F, subparagraph (1).
29 K.  The trust shall establish an industrial climate transition initiative to develop and 
30 support climate change mitigation strategies designed to reduce greenhouse gas 
31 emissions at industrial facilities in the State.  In establishing the initiative and 
32 developing climate change mitigation strategies for industrial facilities, the trust shall:
33 (1)  Prioritize mitigation strategies identified in the State's climate action plan, as 
34 adopted and updated under Title 38, section 577, that offer the most cost-effective 
35 means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at industrial facilities; and
36 (2)  Consider mitigation strategies and other recommendations identified by any 
37 working group, task force or other advisory body that is established by the Maine 
38 Climate Council, established under Title 38, section 577‑A, to develop strategies 
39 and other recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at industrial 
40 facilities in the State.
41 The trust may allocate funds from the trust fund, and may expend any federal funds or 
42 other public or private funding that may be available, to establish the initiative under 
Page 6 - 131LR0775(01)43 this paragraph and to develop and support climate change mitigation strategies 
44 designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at industrial facilities in the State.
