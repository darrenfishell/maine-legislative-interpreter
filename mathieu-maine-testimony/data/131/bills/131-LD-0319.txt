2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §564, sub-§5, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 276, §1,

45.  Mandatory facility replacement.  Upon the expiration date of a manufacturer's

6 properly abandoned in accordance with section 566‑A, except that a double-walled tank 
7 may continue in service up to 10 years beyond the expiration of the warranty if:
8 A.  During the year the warranty expires but on a date before the warranty expires, a 
9 precision test is conducted to determine the integrity of the tank.  Results of the test 
10 conducted must be submitted to the commissioner by the facility owner; and
11 B.  During the 5th to 10th years  Beginning in the 5th year after the expiration of the 
12 warranty, a precision test is conducted annually to determine the integrity of the tank.

14 This subsection does not apply until January 1, 2008 to a tank installed before December

16SUMMARY
17 Under current law, upon the expiration date of a manufacturer's warranty for certain 
18 underground oil storage tanks, the tank and its associated piping must be removed from 
19 service and properly abandoned, except that a double-walled underground oil storage tank 
20 may continue in service up to 10 years beyond the expiration of the warranty if certain 
21 testing is conducted to verify the integrity of the tank.  This bill removes the 10-year 
22 limitation, thereby allowing such double-walled tanks to continue in service indefinitely as 
23 long as the same testing requirements are satisfied.17
