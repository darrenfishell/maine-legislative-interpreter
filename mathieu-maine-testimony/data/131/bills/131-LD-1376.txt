Page 1 - 131LR2201(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§1, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Minimum wage.  The minimum hourly wage is $7.50 per hour.  Starting January 
5 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2018, the 
6 minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, the minimum hourly 
7 wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum hourly wage is $12.00 
8 per hour; and starting January 1, 2024, the minimum hourly wage is $15.00 per hour.  On 
9 January 1, 2025 and each January 1st thereafter to January 1, 2033, the minimum hourly 
10 wage then in effect is increased by $1.00 per hour or by the increase in the cost of living, 
11 whichever is greater.  On January 1, 2021 2034 and each January 1st thereafter, the 
12 minimum hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost 
13 of living. The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, 
14 if any, as of August of the previous year over the level as of August of the year preceding 
15 that year in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI-
16 W, for the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the United States 
17 Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount 
18 of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.   If the highest federal 
19 minimum wage is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect under this section, 
20 the minimum wage under this section is increased to the same amount, effective on the 
21 same date as the increase in the federal minimum wage, and must be increased in 
22 accordance with this section thereafter.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill increases the minimum hourly wage to $15 per hour starting January 1, 2024.  
25 Beginning January 1, 2025 to and including January 1, 2033, the minimum hourly wage is 
26 increased by $1 per hour or by the increase in the cost of living, whichever is greater.   On 
27 January 1, 2034 and every year thereafter, the minimum wage increases by the increase, if 
28 any, in the cost of living.24
