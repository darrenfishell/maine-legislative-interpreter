7 criminal history until after the housing provider determines that the applicant meets all 
8 other qualifications for tenancy.
9 A person who is aggrieved by a violation of the Maine Fair Chance Housing Act by a 
10 housing provider may file a grievance with the Maine Human Rights Commission and, if 
11 it is a violation by a private housing provider, may bring a civil action in court.1
