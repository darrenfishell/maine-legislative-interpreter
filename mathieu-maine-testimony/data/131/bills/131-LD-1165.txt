25SUMMARY
26 This bill removes a provision that requires that compensation remitted by or on behalf 
27 of a pharmaceutical manufacturer, developer or labeler to a pharmacy benefits manager be 
28 remitted to the carrier if it is not remitted to the covered person. It retains the provision that 
29 requires that the compensation be remitted to the covered person to reduce the out-of-
30 pocket costs associated with a prescription drug.  It requires pharmacy benefits managers 
31 to annually report compliance with this requirement to the Superintendent of Insurance.  It 
32 authorizes the superintendent to impose civil penalties and take enforcement action for 
33 noncompliance by a carrier or pharmacy benefits manager.  It designates the information 
34 provided as confidential.26
