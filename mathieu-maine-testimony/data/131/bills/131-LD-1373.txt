10Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §2803-A, as amended by PL 2015, c. 420, §2, is further

12§2803-A.  Loss information
131.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
14 following terms have the following meanings.
15 A.  "Insurance policy" means the insurance policy relating to the loss information 
16 requested pursuant to this section.
17 A-1.  "High-cost claimant" means an individual insured whose aggregate claims exceed 
18 $50,000 during the 12-month period preceding the request for loss information.
19 B.  "Loss information" means the aggregate claims experience of the group insurance 
20 policy or contract.  "Loss information" includes the amount of premium received, the 
21 amount of claims paid and the loss ratio.  "Loss information" does not include any 
22 information or data pertaining to the medical diagnosis, treatment or health status that 
23 identifies an individual covered under the group contract or policy.
24 C.  "Loss ratio" means the ratio between the amount of premium received and the 
25 amount of claims paid by the insurer under the group insurance contract or policy.
262.  Disclosure of basic loss information.  Upon written request, every insurer shall 
27 provide loss information, in accordance with the minimum requirements of paragraph A, 
28 concerning a group policy or contract to its policyholder, to a former policyholder or to a 
29 school administrative unit pursuant to Title 20‑A, section 1001, subsection 14, paragraph 
30 E within 21 business days of the date of the request.  This subsection does not apply to a 
31 former policyholder whose coverage terminated more than 18 months prior to the date of 
32 a request.  For the purposes of this subsection, "school administrative unit" has the same 
33 meaning as in Title 20‑A, section 1, subsection 26.
34 A.  The loss information provided by an insurer must include:
35 (1)  A minimum of 24 months of claims data or, if that period is less than 24 
36 months, claims data for the period the policyholder, former policyholder or school

45 report request; and
5 (4)  A statement describing precertification requests for hospital stays of 5 days or 
6 longer that were made during the 30-day period preceding the date of the report 
7 request.
83.  Transmittal of request.  An insurance contractor or producer  or other authorized 
9 representative who receives a request for loss information in accordance with this section 
10 shall transmit the request for loss information to the insurer within 4 business days.
11 A.  An insurer receiving a disclosure request under subsection 2 may transmit high-
12 cost claimant data directly to another insurer or underwriter, or to a contractor or 
13 producer that has signed with that insurer a business associate agreement that is in 
14 accordance with 45 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 164.502(e) and 164.504(e), 
15 for the purpose of securing quotes, developing actuarial reports, facilitating claim

18 B.  A group policyholder receiving any high-cost claimant reports shall take all 
19 precautions and actions required under 45 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 
20 164.504(f) with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information of 
21 a high-cost claimant, notwithstanding any exemption that may apply to the 
22 policyholder under federal law.  An insurer that has received a disclosure request under 
23 subsection 2 may not transmit high-cost claimant data to any group policyholder that 
24 is not in compliance with this paragraph.
254.  Exception.  An insurer is not required to provide the loss information described in 
26 this section for a group that is eligible for small group coverage pursuant to section 2808‑B. :
