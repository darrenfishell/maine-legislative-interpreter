8 (1)  Changes in the number of days or hours worked;
9 (2)  Changes in the time the employee arrives to or departs from work;
10 (3)  Working from home; and
11 (4)  Job-sharing.
12 "Flexible working arrangement" does not include routine scheduling of shifts, vacation 
13 or other employee leave.
14 B. "Inconsistent with business operations" includes, with regard to a flexible working 
15 arrangement, the following conditions:
16 (1)  The burden of additional costs on an employer;
17 (2)  A detrimental effect, unrelated to discrimination or other unlawful employment 
18 practices, on aggregate employee morale;  
19 (3)  A detrimental effect on the ability of an employer to meet consumer demand;
20 (4)  An inability to reorganize work among existing staff;
21 (5)  An inability to recruit additional staff;
22 (6)  A detrimental impact on business quality or business performance;
23 (7)  An insufficiency of work during the periods the employee proposes to work; 
24 and
25 (8)  Planned structural changes to the business.
262. Right to request a flexible working arrangement.  An employee may request a 
27 flexible working arrangement up to twice per calendar year. The employer shall consider a 
28 request in accordance with subsection 3 twice per calendar year.  A flexible working 
29 arrangement under this section must meet the needs of the employer and employee.
303. Request and response.  The employer shall discuss in good faith the request for a 
31 flexible working arrangement with the employee. The employer and employee may 
32 propose alternative arrangements during the discussion. The employer shall consider the 
33 employee's request for a flexible working arrangement and whether the request can be 
34 granted in a manner that is not inconsistent with business operations or the employer's legal 
35 or contractual obligations. The employer is not required to grant the request. The employer 
36 shall notify the employee of the employer's decision regarding the request. If the request 
37 was submitted in writing, the employer shall state any complete or partial denial of the 
38 request in writing.

2 employee under this chapter or pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. An employer

4 by this section. This section does not affect any legal rights an employer or employee may 
5 have under applicable law to create, modify or terminate a flexible working arrangement.
65. Retaliation prohibited.  An employer may not retaliate against an employee 
7 exercising a right under this section. An employer may not discharge an employee from 
8 employment or discriminate against an employee because that employee asserted or 
9 attempted to assert the right to make a request under this section.
106. Enforcement.  An employer that violates this section commits a civil violation for 
11 which a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500 per violation may be adjudged. 
12 The Department of Labor shall enforce this section.
13SUMMARY

18 to the flexible working arrangement. The employer is not required to grant the employee’s 
19 request for a flexible working arrangement.14
