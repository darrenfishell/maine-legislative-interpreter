15 (2)  The candidate has a lower vote  preference total than a candidate described in

27 further amended to read:
282.  Procedures.  Except as provided in subsections 3 and 4, the following procedures 
29 are used to determine the winner of an election determined by ranked-choice voting.  The 
30 ranked‑choice voting count must proceed in rounds.  In each round, the number of votes  
31 preferences for each continuing candidate must be counted.  Each continuing ballot counts 
32 as one vote  preference for its highest-ranked continuing candidate for that round.  
33 Exhausted ballots are not counted for any continuing candidate.  The round then ends with 
34 one of the following 2 potential outcomes.
35 A.  If there are 2 or fewer continuing candidates, the candidate with the most votes  
36 preferences is declared the winner of the election.
37 B.  If there are more than 2 continuing candidates, the last-place candidate is defeated 
38 and a new round begins.

5Sec. 8.  21-A MRSA §723-A, sub-§3-A is enacted to read:
63-A.  Returns; vote total.  On a ranked-choice ballot, a vote is not returned until all 
7 the preferences have been considered or the tabulation process in this section demonstrates 
8 that the outcome does not depend on considering additional preferences. When tabulating 
9 the vote total in any contest, the number of preferences after that candidate's final round of 
10 tabulation is deemed that candidate's vote total.
11Sec. 9.  21-A MRSA §723-A, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2017, c. 316, §9, is further 
12 amended to read:
135.  Effect on rights of political parties.  For all statutory and constitutional provisions 
14 in the State pertaining to the rights of political parties, the number of votes cast for a party's 
15 candidate for an office determined by ranked-choice voting is the number of votes  
16 preferences credited to that candidate after the initial counting in the first round described 
17 in subsection 2.
18Sec. 10.  21-A MRSA §723-A, sub-§5-B, as amended by PL 2021, c. 273, §11, is 
19 further amended to read:
205-B.  Presidential primary elections; selection of delegates.  Notwithstanding any 
21 provision of this section to the contrary, for presidential primary elections, batch 
22 elimination may not be used for any candidates with more than 100 votes  preferences, 
23 tabulation must continue until only 2 continuing candidates remain, separate tabulations 
24 must be conducted statewide and for each congressional district and selection and 
25 allocation of delegates to a party's national presidential nominating convention must be in 
26 accordance with any reasonable procedures established at the state party convention.
27Sec. 11.  21-A MRSA §723-A, sub-§5-B, as amended by PL 2021, c. 750, §11 and 
28 affected by §14, is further amended to read:
295-B.  Presidential primary elections; selection of delegates.  Notwithstanding any 
30 provision of this section to the contrary, for presidential primary elections, batch 
31 elimination may not be used for any candidates with more than 100 votes  preferences, 
32 tabulation must continue until only 2 continuing candidates remain, separate tabulations 
33 must be conducted statewide and for each congressional district and selection and 
34 allocation of delegates to a party's national presidential nominating convention must be in 
35 accordance with any reasonable procedures established at the state party convention, except 
36 that unenrolled voters who participate in the party's primary election must be considered 
37 members of the party for purposes of allocating delegates.
38Sec. 12.  21-A MRSA §723-A, sub-§5-C is enacted to read:
395-C.  Construction.  This section must be liberally construed to effectuate the 
40 legislative purpose of capturing a voter's full expression of preferences in ranked-choice 
41 voting contests where 3 or more candidates appear; any single preference may not be 
42 considered the voter's vote for the purpose of determining the election winner unless the 
43 voter has not expressed a preference for another continuing candidate. The Legislature 
Page 3 - 131LR0796(01)44 finds and declares that the complete and undivided expression of all preferences by a voter 
45 is the only valid expression of the voter's vote in any contest and that a single preference 
46 ranking alone may not validly be considered the voter's vote unless that voter has not 
47 expressed a preference for another continuing candidate.
5Sec. 13.  Effective date. That section of this Act that amends the Maine Revised 
6 Statutes, Title 21-A, section 723-A, subsection 5-B, as amended by Public Law 2021, 
7 chapter 750, section 11 and affected by section 14, takes effect January 1, 2024.
8SUMMARY
9 This bill amends the ranked-choice voting law by replacing "votes" when done as part 
10 of the ranking with "preference"; the purpose of this change is to clarify that the voter is 
11 expressing a preference when using ranked-choice voting, as opposed to voting in each 
12 round.  The bill defines "vote" as the final expression of all the preferences made by a voter 
13 in one election and establishes that the number of preferences after a candidate's final round 
14 is deemed to be that candidate's vote total.  A vote is not considered returned until all the 
15 preferences have been considered or further consideration would not make a difference in 
16 the outcome.
17 Finally, the bill requires the ranked-choice voting law to be liberally construed.1
