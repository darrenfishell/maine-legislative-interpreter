23 are appropriate to meet the child’s best interest while minimizing the effect on the 
24 parent who experienced the sexual assault or nonconsensual removal of or tampering 
25 with a condom. The court may order specific conditions, including but not limited to 
26 limiting the contact between the parents or limiting or putting specific conditions on
