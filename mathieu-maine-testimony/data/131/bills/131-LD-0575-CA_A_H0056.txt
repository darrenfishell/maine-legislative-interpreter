further amended to read: 
A-1. The requirements of subsection 3-A do not apply to a driver or passenger who 
has a medical condition that, in the opinion of a physician, warrants an exemption from 
the requirements of subsection 3-A and that medical condition and opinion are 
documented by a certificate from that physician. That certificate is valid for the period 
designated by the physician, which may not exceed oae year 6 years. The Secretary of 
State may issue a removable windshield placard that is visible to law enforcement 
officers to a person with a certificate from a physician. A removable windshield placard 
is a 2-sided permit designed to hang from the rearview mirror when the vehicle is in 
motion without obstructing the view of the operator. The placard must be displayed by 
hanging it from the rearview mirror so that it may be viewed from the front and rear of 
the vehicle when the vehicle is in motion. If the vehicle is not equipped with a rearview 
mirror, the placard must be displayed on the dashboard. The placard must be 
identifiable as a seat belt placard as designed by the Secretary of State. A placard issued 
to a person under this paragraph expires when the physician's certificate expires.

allocations are made.
