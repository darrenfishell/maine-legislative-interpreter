Page 1 - 131LR1184(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to  make substantial changes to the Maine Indian Claims Settlement 
6 Implementing Act to address some of the consensus recommendations of the Task Force 
7 on Changes to the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Implementing Act, referred to in this 
8 summary as "the task force," and make other changes regarding the Maine Indian Claims 
9 Settlement Implementing Act.  The task force's report was released on January 14, 2020 
10 and is available online at http://legislature.maine.gov/maine-indian-claims-tf. In this 
11 summary, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30, chapter 601, which is titled AN ACT to 
12 Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement, enacted by Public Law 1979, chapter 732, 
13 is referred to as "the Maine Implementing Act" and the federal Maine Indian Claims 
14 Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420, formerly codified at 25 United States Code, 
15 Sections 1721 to 1735, is referred to as "the federal Settlement Act."  The federal Settlement 
16 Act ratified the Maine Implementing Act, and both have an effective date of October 10, 
17 1980. 
18 The purpose of the reconsideration and rewriting of the Maine Implementing Act 
19 would be to establish that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton 
20 Band of Maliseet Indians  and the Mi'kmaq Nation have the same rights to self-
21 determination as other federally recognized Indian tribes within the United States.  This 
22 bill would make changes to the Maine Implementing Act to restore back to the tribes many 
23 of the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities enjoyed by other federally 
24 recognized Indian tribes within the United States, which were restricted by the Maine 
25 Implementing Act.  This would be a significant change from the current law, which 
26 provides the State with significant authority over Indian affairs.  To carry out this 
27 significant change, many provisions of Title 30, chapter 601 would be repealed or amended 
28 to recognize that federal Indian law governs the rights, privileges, powers, duties and 
29 immunities of the tribe, nations and band. 
30 Under the bill, except as otherwise specified in the Maine Implementing Act, federal 
31 Indian law would apply  with regard to the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities 
32 of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 
33 and the Mi'kmaq Nation.  "Federal Indian law" is defined for this summary to mean the 
34 United States Constitution and all generally applicable federal statutes, regulations and 
35 common law and case law interpreting, implementing, applying or enforcing those federal 
36 laws and regulations, and subsequent amendments thereto, relating to the rights, status, 
37 privileges, powers, duties and immunities of federally recognized Indian tribes and their 
38 members and land or other natural resources within the United States. This definition 
39 explicitly recognizes that federal Indian law is not static, but evolves as federal common 
40 law develops, federal laws are passed and amended and as federal courts interpret the 
41 relevant statutes and regulations and their application to federally recognized Indian tribes, 
42 nations, bands and other groups.4
Page 2 - 131LR1184(01)1 This bill would incorporate within the Maine Implementing Act the definition of 
2 "Houlton Band Trust Land" from the federal Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 
3 Supplementary Claims Settlement Act of 1986.
4 This bill would define "Mi'kmaq Nation Trust Land" to include land or other natural 
5 resources acquired by the United States Secretary of the Interior in trust for the Mi'kmaq 
6 Nation pursuant to federal Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act.
7 This bill would define "Indian territory or trust land" to include, with respect to the 
8 Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, the tribe's or nation's Indian territory, with 
9 respect to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Houlton Band Trust Land, and with 
10 respect to the Mi'kmaq Nation, Mi'kmaq Nation Trust Land.  This phrase is used throughout 
11 the bill to describe the lands over which the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, 
12 the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Mi'kmaq Nation may exercise rights, 
13 privileges, powers, duties and immunities similar to those of other federally recognized 
14 Indian tribes within the United States.
15 This bill would restructure  the procedures for addition of new land to tribal territories. 
16 The procedures required would depend upon the location of the land and the time of 
17 acquisition. 
18 This bill would eliminate the language in the Maine Implementing Act regarding 
19 takings of tribal land for public use under state law. 
20 This bill would provide that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the 
21 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Mi'kmaq Nation, as well as their officers and 
22 employees, are immune from suit to the same extent as other federally recognized Indian 
23 tribes and their officers and employees under federal Indian law.
24 The Maine Implementing Act currently limits the criminal jurisdiction of the 
25 Passamaquoddy Tribal Court and the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court as well as the potential 
26 criminal jurisdiction of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal Court and the Mi'kmaq 
27 Nation Tribal Court. Federal Indian law provides broader jurisdiction for tribal courts.  This 
28 bill would repeal most of the state limitations and recognize and adopt most of federal 
29 Indian law, including the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Tribal Law and Order Act of 
30 2010, the tribal provisions of the Violence Against Women Act and other federal laws 
31 addressing tribal court jurisdiction and the obligations of the tribal courts.  This bill would 
32 restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribal Court, the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court, the Houlton 
33 Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal Court and the Mi'kmaq Nation Tribal Court criminal 
34 jurisdiction over Indians and recognize the courts' authority to impose the maximum 
35 penalties other tribal courts are authorized to impose under the federal Tribal Law and 
36 Order Act of 2010, as long as the due process protections required by that Act are observed.
37 This bill would amend state law to recognize tribal court jurisdiction, concurrent with 
38 the state courts, over offenses committed on tribal lands by Indian defendants against non-
39 Indian victims, subject to the maximum penalty provisions and due process requirements 
40 of the federal Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010.  
41 This bill would retain current law providing that the exclusive authority of the 
42 Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and 
43 the Mi'kmaq Nation to exercise criminal jurisdiction over Indians on tribal lands remains 
44 at the discretion of the tribe, nations and band.  To the extent that the tribe, nations or band 
Page 3 - 131LR1184(01)45 does not exercise, or terminates its exercise of, exclusive criminal jurisdiction, the State 
46 would have exclusive jurisdiction over those matters. 
3 This bill would provide that, when the tribal courts of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the 
4 Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Mi'kmaq Nation exercise 
5 exclusive or concurrent criminal jurisdiction, the definitions of the criminal offenses and 
6 the punishments applicable to those criminal offenses are governed by state law, except 
7 that the punishments imposed by a tribal court may not exceed the maximum punishments 
8 that a tribal court may impose under 25 United States Code, Section 1302(a)(7).
9 This bill would recognize federal Indian law regarding the exclusive jurisdiction of 
10 tribes to regulate fishing and hunting by tribal citizens of all federally recognized Indian 
11 tribes on tribal lands.  This bill would amend the Maine Implementing Act to restore and 
12 affirm the exclusive jurisdiction of tribes to regulate fishing and hunting by nontribal 
13 citizens on tribal lands but would  not cede to the State any authority of the Maine Indian 
14 Tribal-State Commission to regulate fishing on boundary waters under current law. 
15 This bill would relinquish the State's jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of 
16 fishing and hunting by both tribal and nontribal citizens on tribal lands.  The State, solely 
17 for conservation purposes, would be allowed to regulate tribal members engaged in such 
18 activities off tribal lands to the extent permitted under general principles of federal Indian 
19 law and in a manner consistent with reserved tribal treaty rights. 
20 This bill would amend state law to restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot 
21 Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Mi'kmaq Nation the exclusive 
22 authority to exercise civil legislative jurisdiction over Indians on tribal lands and the 
23 concurrent authority to exercise civil legislative jurisdiction over non-Indians on tribal 
24 lands, including in the area of taxation, as provided by federal Indian law.  This bill would 
25 amend state law to restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton 
26 Band of Maliseet Indians and the Mi'kmaq Nation the exclusive authority to exercise civil 
27 adjudicatory jurisdiction over Indians on tribal lands and the concurrent authority to 
28 exercise civil adjudicatory jurisdiction over non-Indians on tribal lands, as provided by 
29 federal Indian law.
30 This bill would provide that, notwithstanding any provision of the Maine Implementing 
31 Act to the contrary, the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of 
32 Maliseet Indians and the Mi'kmaq Nation may conduct gaming activities only in 
33 accordance with state law and may not conduct gaming activities under the authority of the 
34 federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or under any regulations thereunder promulgated 
35 by the chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission or its successor organization. 
36 This bill would take effect 120 days after adjournment of the session during which it 
37 was enacted only if, within 90 days after adjournment of that session, the Secretary of State 
38 receives written certification from the Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe 
39 that the tribe has agreed to its provisions; the Governor and the Council of the Penobscot 
40 Nation that the nation has agreed to its provisions; the Houlton Band Council of the Houlton 
41 Band of Maliseet Indians that the band has agreed to its provisions; and the Mi'kmaq Nation 
42 Tribal Council that the nation has agreed to its provisions.
43 This bill would repeal or repeal and replace each provision of the Maine Implementing 
44 Act that was enacted by Public Law 1981, chapter 675 and provide that, if the Houlton 
45 Band Council of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians certifies its agreement to the 1
2
Page 4 - 131LR1184(01)46 provisions of this legislation, upon such certification each provision of this legislation 
47 constitutes a jurisdictional agreement between the State and the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
48 Indians for purposes of Section 6(e)(2) of the federal Settlement Act but would not 
49 constitute an agreement by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that the contingencies of 
50 Public Law 1981, chapter 675 were met or that the provisions of Public Law 1981, chapter 
51 675 ever took effect. 
7 This bill would repeal or repeal and replace each provision of Title 30, chapter 603 that 
8 was enacted by Public Law 1989, chapter 148 and provide that, if the Tribal Council of the 
9 Mi'kmaq Nation certifies its agreement to the provisions of this legislation, upon such 
10 certification each provision of this legislation constitutes a jurisdictional agreement 
11 between the State and the Mi'kmaq Nation for purposes of Section 6(d) of the federal 
12 Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act but would not constitute an agreement by the 
13 Mi'kmaq Nation that the contingencies of Public Law 1989, chapter 148 were met or that 
14 the provisions of Public Law 1989, chapter 148 ever took effect.1
