16 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT •A "to HP 837, L D 1322 
C. Nothmg m this subsection limits the right of a school board to choose to adopt or 
to choose not to adopt a remote participation policy under subsection 2 ' 
Amend the bill by relettermg or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
number to read consecutively 
SUMMARY 
This amendment corrects a conflict withm the language of the bill Under current law, 
a public body that is under the Jurisdiction of another public body that has adopted a remote 
part1cipat10n policy may choose to adopt its own remote participation policy By contrast, 
under the bill and the amendment, a pubhc body under the Jurisdiction of the county 
commissioners of a county, municipal officers of a mumcipahty or officers of a regional or 
other political subdivision that have adopted a remote participation policy may not adopt 
its own remote participation policy unless the county comm1ss1oners, municipal officers or 
other officers of the regional or other political subd1v1sion specifically authorize 1t to do so 
The amendment also clarifies that, regardless of the remote participation policies adopted 
by other pubhc bodies, a school board has the authority to choose to adopt or to choose not 
to adopt its own remote participation pohcy.
