Page 6 - 131LR0818(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill amends the Maine New Markets Capital Investment Program and the new 
3 markets capital investment income tax credit to establish a new tax credit authority, referred 
4 to as "the program 2 tax credit authority," for tax credit authority allocated by the Finance 
5 Authority of Maine on or after January 1, 2023.  This bill establishes an application process 
6 for community development entities recognized as Maine funds and diverse Maine funds 
7 to receive an allocation of tax credit authority.
8 The effect of this change on the Maine New Markets Capital Investment Program is to 
9 shorten the period, from 24 months to 6 months after receipt of the notice of allocation of 
10 the tax credit authority, by which a community development entity must issue the equity 
11 investments or debt securities and receive cash in the total amount of tax credits authorized. 
12 The limit on the amount of tax credits authorized is unchanged.
13 The effect of this change on the new markets capital investment tax credit is to shorten 
14 the time, from 24 months to 12 months after issuance of the qualified equity investment, 
15 by which a community development entity must invest at least 85% of the purchase price 
16 of the qualified equity investment in qualified low-income community investments before 
17 recapture of the credit is allowed.
18 This bill makes conforming changes to the new markets capital investment tax credit 
19 provisions to integrate impact qualified equity investments into the existing provisions 
20 governing the eligibility for an allocation of tax credits under the Maine New Markets 
21 Capital Investment Program.  The amount of impact qualified equity investments is 
22 $30,000,000, which may be made in exchange for tax credits, to be invested in historically 
23 disadvantaged groups located anywhere in this State. Fifty percent of impact qualified 
24 equity investments must be reserved for diverse Maine funds, which are community 
25 development financial institutions that have their principal place of business in this State 
26 and are more than 50% owned and controlled by individuals who are racial or ethnic 
27 minorities or members of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe or band in this State 
28 or are governed by a board of directors more than 50% of which are individuals who are 
29 racial or ethnic minorities or members of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe or band 
30 in this State.
31 The maximum amount of an investment made with a qualified equity investment by a 
32 qualified community development entity in a qualified active low-income community 
33 business is $5,000,000.2
