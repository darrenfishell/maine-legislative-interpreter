20 3. Scope of authority. The court shall consider and act on child protection petitions 
21 regardless of other decrees regarding a child's care and custody. The requirements and 
22 provisions of Title 19-A, chapter 58 do not apply to child protection proceedings. If custody

30 matter; or to resolve a child protection proceeding through the entry of a parental rights and

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 82, L.D. 136 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, amends the provision 
3 of law governing the legal effect of an order entered in a child protection proceeding, 
4 including a preliminary protection order, to clarify that such an order generally takes 
5 precedence over any other order regarding the child's care or custody, even if the other 
6 order was entered after the preliminary protection order. It also clarifies that this general 
7 rule does not limit the authority of the District Court to determine parentage during the 
8 pendency of a child protection proceeding, to consolidate a child protection proceeding 
9 with another matter or to resolve a child protection proceeding through the entry of a 
10 parental rights and responsibilities order, a guardianship order or an adoption order. 
11 The amendment also makes technical changes to the bill, including by replacing the 
12 word "paternity" with the word "parentage" to reflect the enactment of the Maine Parentage 
13 Act in Public Law 2015, chapter 296, which eliminated paternity proceedings and replaced 
14 them with proceedings to adjudicate parentage.
