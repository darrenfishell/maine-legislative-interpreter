2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA ยง1613 is enacted to read:
3ยง1613.  Alternative sentencing for primary caregivers
41.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A.  "Dependent" has the same meaning as in Title 33, section 1021, subsection 1.
7 B.  "Elderly" means an individual who is 60 years of age or older.
8 C.  "Physical or mental disability" has the same meaning as in Title 5, section 4553-A, 
9 subsection 1.
10 D.  "Primary caregiver" means a person who has the greatest responsibility for the care 
11 of a minor, an elderly dependent or an individual with a physical or mental disability.
122.  Motion for alternative sentence.  Upon a conviction of an offense that may result 
13 in a sentence of imprisonment, unless the offense requires a sentence of imprisonment, the 
14 court may issue an alternative sentence under section 1502, subsection 2 due to the 
15 defendant's being a primary caregiver. The court shall consider the defendant's status as a 
16 primary caregiver if no more than 10 days after the entry of judgment the defendant makes 
17 a motion for an alternative sentence. A motion for an alternative sentence under this 
18 subsection must be supported by an affidavit by the defendant detailing the basis for the 
19 assertion that the defendant is a caregiver under this section.
203.  Findings.  Upon receipt of a motion for an alternative sentence under subsection 2, 
21 the court shall consider the defendant's status as a primary caregiver and make written 
22 findings of the court's decision prior to issuing the sentence. In making the decision under 
23 this subsection, the court shall consider:
24 A.  The nature and circumstances of the offense committed;
25 B.  The history and character of the defendant;
26 C.  The defendant's family circumstances and relationships; and
27 D.  The impact of any sentence considered on every individual for whom the defendant 
28 is the primary caregiver.
29SUMMARY
30 This bill requires a court in sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense that may 
31 result in a term of imprisonment, upon motion of the defendant and supported by an 
32 affidavit, to consider an alternative sentence other than imprisonment due to the defendant's 
33 being a primary caregiver of a minor, elderly dependent or individual with a mental or 
34 physical disability. In making the decision, the court is required to consider factors such as 
35 the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and character of the defendant, the 
36 defendant's family circumstances and relationships and the impact of any sentence 
37 considered on every individual for whom the defendant is the primary caregiver.  The court 
38 is required to make written findings of the court's decision before issuing the sentence.30
