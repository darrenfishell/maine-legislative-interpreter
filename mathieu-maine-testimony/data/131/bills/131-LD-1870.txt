Page 1 - 131LR2423(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA ยง2020 is enacted to read:
3ยง2020.  Child whose parent is killed during an operating under the influence offense
41. Restitution required.  In addition to any other restitution ordered under this chapter, 
5 if a defendant is convicted of an offense under Title 12, section 10701, subsection 1-A, 
6 paragraph B, C or D or Title 29-A, section 2411 that results in the death of a person and 
7 the person is the parent of a minor, the court shall order restitution in the form of 
8 maintenance for each child of the person until each child reaches 18 years of age and has 
9 graduated from secondary school or the majority of the class of which each child is a 
10 member when the child reaches 18 years of age has graduated from secondary school.
112. Amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of restitution under 
12 this section that is reasonable and necessary for the maintenance of a child under subsection 
13 1 considering all relevant factors, including:
14 A. The financial needs and resources of the child;
15 B. The financial needs and resources of any surviving parent or guardian of the child, 
16 including the State if the child is in the custody of the Department of Health and Human 
17 Services;
18 C. The standard of living to which the child is accustomed;
19 D. The physical and emotional condition of the child and the child's emotional needs;
20 E. The child's physical and legal custody arrangements; and
21 F. The reasonable work-related child care expenses of any surviving parent or guardian 
22 of the child.
233. Payments to clerk. The defendant shall make restitution payments to the clerk of 
24 the court as trustee for remittance to the child's parent or guardian under subsection 2, 
25 paragraph B. The clerk shall deposit a payment no later than the next business day after 
26 receipt of the payment and remit the payment to the surviving parent or guardian designated 
27 by the court within 10 business days of receipt of the payment. 
284. Incarcerated defendant.  If the defendant under subsection 1 is incarcerated and 
29 unable to pay the restitution, the defendant has up to one year after release from 
30 incarceration to begin payment, including entering into a payment plan, of the arrearage. If 
31 the restitution period under subsection 1 ends and the restitution is not paid in full, 
32 payments must continue until the arrearage is paid.
335. Civil action by surviving parent or guardian.  If a surviving parent or guardian 
34 brings a civil action against the defendant prior to the court's ordering restitution under 
35 subsection 1 and the parent or guardian obtains a favorable judgment in the civil action, the 
36 court may not order the restitution. If a surviving parent or guardian brings a civil action 
37 against the defendant and obtains a favorable judgment subsequent to the court's ordering 
38 restitution under subsection 1, the restitution must be offset by the amount of the judgment 
39 awarded in the civil action.
Page 2 - 131LR2423(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill requires that a defendant convicted of operating under the influence, when the 
3 crime resulted in the death of a person who is a parent of a minor, pay restitution to the 
4 surviving parent or guardian for each child of the person killed until each child reaches 18 
5 years of age and graduates, or the classes in which the children are members graduate, from 
6 secondary school. The amount of restitution is based upon relevant factors regarding the 
7 child's needs and accustomed standard of living. Any arrearage accumulated due to the 
8 defendant's being incarcerated is required to be paid after the defendant is released from 
9 incarceration.  The court is prohibited from ordering restitution if a surviving parent or 
10 guardian obtains a civil judgment against the defendant prior to sentencing, and any civil 
11 judgment obtained after restitution is ordered offsets the restitution.2
