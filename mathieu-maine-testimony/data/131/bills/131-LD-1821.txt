Page 1 - 131LR2439(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the City of Bath is authorized pursuant to state law and its charter to borrow 
4 money and to issue its general obligation bonds and notes in furtherance of its municipal 
5 purposes; and
6Whereas, at a city referendum held November 8, 2022, the voters of the city voted to 
7 adopt a bond ordinance that authorized the city to issue up to $13,500,000 of its general 
8 obligation bonds and notes to finance the construction and equipping of a new fire station, 
9 as described in the notices, warrants and ballots for the referendum; and
10Whereas, the voters of the city voted in favor of the bond question, 2,731 in favor and 
11 1,264 against, with 285 blank ballots; and
12Whereas, Section 1009 of the city charter requires that the complete text of the bond 
13 ordinance be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city not less than 10 
14 days nor more than 15 days prior to the election; and
15Whereas, while the complete text of the bond ordinance was not published in a 
16 newspaper of general circulation in the city between 10 and 15 days prior to the election, 
17 the city held at least 5 workshops or public meetings on the bond prior to the election, the 
18 local newspaper printed an article about the proposed bond on October 9, 2022 and sample 
19 ballots were posted throughout the city; and
20Whereas, the failure to publish the text of the bond ordinance as strictly required by 
21 the city creates a legal technicality that could affect the marketability of the bonds or notes 
22 to be issued by the city in connection with the project; and
23Whereas, the city council will review the posting and notice requirements regarding 
24 permanent financing, initiatives and referenda in the city charter and present amendments 
25 for a referendum to address inconsistencies and improve the posting and notice process by 
26 November 7, 2023; and
27Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
28 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
29 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
30 therefore,
31Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
32Sec. 1. Validation and authorization.  Notwithstanding any provision of the 
33 Maine Revised Statutes or the charter of the City of Bath to the contrary, the City of Bath 
34 referendum conducted on November 8, 2022 and the proceedings related to that referendum 
35 are validated and made effective. The City of Bath is authorized to enter into contracts and 
36 to issue bonds or notes of the city in an amount not to exceed $13,500,000 to finance the 
37 construction and equipping of a new fire station, all as set forth in the bond ordinance the 
38 voters of the City of Bath voted to adopt on November 8, 2022 of the warrant and ballot 
39 for the referendum.
40Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
41 takes effect when approved.
