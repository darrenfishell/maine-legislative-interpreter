5 for payment with all carriers potentially liable for payment of the claim whether primary 
6 or secondary.  Payment or denial of a claim by each carrier must be made within 30 calendar 
7 days after the carrier has received all information needed to pay or deny the claim whether 
8 or not another carrier with which it is attempting to coordinate has acted on the claim.  If a 
9 carrier makes payments to a health care provider using an electronic processing method by 
10 credit card or debit card, the carrier shall also offer the health care provider another method 
11 of payment that does not require the provider to pay any additional fees or incur any costs 
12 to accept payment of the claim.  Any payment made must be in accordance with rules 
13 adopted by the superintendent relative to coordination of benefits.
