2Sec. 1.  23 MRSA ยง357 is enacted to read:
3ยง357.  Corrosion prevention and mitigation; bridges
4 The Department of Transportation shall adopt rules governing corrosion prevention 
5 and mitigation methods for bridges wholly or partly under the control of the State for 
6 projects costing $50,000 or more.  Rules adopted pursuant to this section must include, but 
7 are not limited to, establishing a process for ensuring that corrosion prevention and 
8 mitigation activities are carried out in accordance with established corrosion prevention 
9 and mitigation standards, requiring the use of personnel who are industry-trained and 
10 industry-certified in corrosion prevention and mitigation methods on any type of substrate 
11 or surface and requiring plans to prevent environmental degradation that might result from 
12 corrosion prevention and mitigation activities.  Rules adopted pursuant to this section are 
13 routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
14Sec. 2.  Rulemaking.  Rulemaking conducted pursuant to this Act is governed by 
15 this section.
161.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
17 following terms have the following meanings.
18 A.  "Corrosion" means the deterioration of a material, usually a metal or concrete, that 
19 results from a chemical or electrochemical reaction with its environment.
20 B.  "Corrosion prevention and mitigation" means:
21 (1)  The preparation, application, installation, removal and general maintenance as 
22 necessary of a protective coating system, including but not limited to:
23 (a) Surface preparation and coating application on the interior or exterior of 
24 the surface;
25 (b) Removal of a lead-based or other hazardous coating;
26 (c) Painting of structural steel fabricated for installation; and
27 (d) Installation of coatings and surfacing on concrete or other cementitious 
28 substrates; and
29 (2) With respect to bridges, any activities related to corrosion prevention, including 
30 cathodic protection, that in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this Act must 
31 be performed by industry-trained and industry-certified personnel.
32 C.  "Corrosion prevention project" means a project costing $50,000 or more consisting 
33 of corrosion prevention and mitigation activities performed during construction, 
34 alteration, maintenance or repair work or at any other time necessary on bridge 
35 infrastructure.
36 D.  "Industry-trained and industry-certified" means:
37 (1)  Completion of, or current enrollment in for at least the entire duration of a 
38 corrosion prevention project, a state-certified apprenticeship training program that 
39 requires concurrent on-the-job training and classroom instruction for an individual 
40 to be considered adequately knowledgeable to perform corrosion prevention and 
41 mitigation activities; or
Page 2 - 131LR2299(01)1 (2)  Confirmation from a corrosion prevention industry credentialing organization 
2 whose standards for corrosion prevention and mitigation meet state requirements 
3 that an individual is adequately trained to perform corrosion prevention and 
4 mitigation activities or conduct inspections.
52.  Rulemaking. In adopting rules to implement the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, 
6 section 357, the Department of Transportation shall adopt rules that:
7 A.  Provide the same standards and requirements for corrosion prevention and 
8 mitigation methods as are established by the Society for Protective Coatings for its 
9 coating application specialist program; the National Association of Corrosion 
10 Engineers for its certified coating applicator program; and the National Association of 
11 Corrosion Engineers International Institute;
12 B.  Require the use of industry-trained and industry-certified personnel:
13 (1)  To perform corrosion prevention and mitigation activities on any type of 
14 substrate or surface; and
15 (2)  As inspectors to ensure best practices and standards are followed in corrosion 
16 prevention projects; and
17 C.  For all corrosion prevention projects, require the development of a plan to prevent 
18 environmental degradation that might result from corrosion prevention and mitigation 
19 activities.
20SUMMARY
21 This bill requires the adoption of rules by the Department of Transportation governing 
22 projects costing $50,000 or more consisting of corrosion prevention and mitigation for 
23 bridge infrastructure.  Rules adopted pursuant to this legislation must include establishing 
24 a process for ensuring that corrosion prevention and mitigation activities are performed in 
25 accordance with established corrosion prevention and mitigation standards, requiring the 
26 use of personnel who are industry-trained and industry-certified in corrosion prevention 
27 and mitigation methods and requiring plans to prevent environmental degradation that 
28 might result from corrosion prevention and mitigation activities.21
