Page 1 - 131LR0751(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §2081, sub-§4, ¶A-1, as amended by PL 2009, c. 436, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 A-1.  The requirements of subsection 3‑A do not apply to a driver or passenger who 
5 has a medical condition that, in the opinion of a physician, warrants an exemption from 
6 the requirements of subsection 3‑A and that medical condition and opinion are 
7 documented by a certificate from that physician.  That certificate is valid for the period 
8 designated by the physician, which may not exceed one year.   The physician shall 
9 designate the duration of the applicant's medical condition not to exceed 6 years or 
10 designate the applicant's medical condition as permanent. The Secretary of State may 
11 issue a removable windshield placard that is visible to law enforcement officers to a 
12 person with a certificate from a physician.  A removable windshield placard is a 2-
13 sided permit designed to hang from the rearview mirror when the vehicle is in motion 
14 without obstructing the view of the operator.  The placard must be displayed by hanging 
15 it from the rearview mirror so that it may be viewed from the front and rear of the 
16 vehicle when the vehicle is in motion.  If the vehicle is not equipped with a rearview 
17 mirror, the placard must be displayed on the dashboard.  The placard must be 
18 identifiable as a seat belt placard as designed by the Secretary of State.  A placard 
19 issued to a person under this paragraph expires when the physician's certificate expires.
20SUMMARY
21 This bill allows a physician, for the purpose of allowing an exemption from the seat 
22 belt requirements for adult drivers and passengers, to designate the duration of the 
23 applicant’s medical condition not to exceed 6 years or designate the applicant’s medical 
24 condition as permanent.21
