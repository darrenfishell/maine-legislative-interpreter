3§1805-A.  Designation of deer wintering areas
4 The director may designate a deer wintering area on a parcel of land under the 
5 jurisdiction of the bureau. The designated area must contain high-quality deer wintering 
6 habitat with a documented history of significant use by deer. The bureau shall manage the 
7 designated area with deer conservation as the highest management priority and may also 
8 manage the designated area to benefit other wildlife species that rely on mature softwood 
9 forests. The director may designate a deer wintering area or remove the designation as a 
10 deer wintering area of a parcel of land under this section only pursuant to a habitat 
11 management agreement developed in collaboration with the Department of Inland Fisheries 
12 and Wildlife. A designated area under this section is eligible for funds from the Maine Deer 
13 Management Fund under section 10264. The designation of a deer wintering area under 
14 this section does not preclude or discourage the department from managing another parcel 
15 of land to promote habitat for deer. The department and the Department of Inland Fisheries 
16 and Wildlife shall include a summary of additions or changes to deer wintering areas under 
17 this section in an annual report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
18 jurisdiction over inland fisheries and wildlife matters and to the joint standing committee 
19 of the Legislature having jurisdiction over agriculture, conservation and forestry matters.

24 fund or assist in funding predator control and to acquire or enhance deer habitat. If the 
25 funds from the fund are used to directly enhance or manage a deer wintering area on land 
26 under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau 
27 of Parks and Lands, the land must be designated as a deer wintering area pursuant to section 
28 1805-A. The commissioner shall establish on the department's online licensing system 
29 checkoff options that allow a person to donate money for predator control or deer habitat 
30 acquisition or enhancement. The checkoff options must be prominently displayed and 
31 contain web links to information about how the checkoff revenues have been and will be 
32 used. The commissioner shall also print in a prominent place on every paper application 
33 for a hunting license checkoff options that allow a person to donate money to the fund for 
34 predator control or deer habitat acquisition or enhancement. Revenues from the checkoffs 
35 must be deposited in the fund and used for purposes indicated by the checkoffs.

38regions to locate unmapped deer wintering areas.  The Department of Agriculture, 
39 Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Parks and Lands and Department of Inland Fisheries

43 pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 1805-A.
