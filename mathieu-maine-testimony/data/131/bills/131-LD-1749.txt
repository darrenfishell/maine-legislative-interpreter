21 4 years of the date of adoption of the rule, then that rule has no further force and effect in 
22 any member state.
233.  Rule adoption procedure.  Rules or amendments to the rules must be adopted at a 
24 regular or special meeting of the commission.
254.  Notice.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the

22 on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider 
23 all written and oral comments received.

25 public hearing by interested parties is received, the commission may proceed with 
26 promulgation of the proposed rule without a public hearing.
2711.  Final action.  The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final 
28 action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based 
29 on the rule-making record and the full text of the rule.
3012.  Emergency rulemaking.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 
31 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity

5 subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.  The revision may 
6 be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.  A 
7 challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the 
8 end of the notice period.  If no challenge is made, the revision takes effect without further 
9 action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval

11§18711. Oversight; dispute resolution; enforcement
121.  Oversight.  Oversight of the compact is governed by this subsection.
13 A.  The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government in each 
14 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate 
15 to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.  The provisions of this compact and 
16 the rules promulgated hereunder have standing as statutory law.
17 B.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or 
18 administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this 
19 compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the commission.
20 C.  The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding under 
21 paragraph B and has standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  
22 Failure to provide service of process to the commission renders a judgment or order 
23 void as to the commission, this compact or promulgated rules.
242.  Default; technical assistance; termination.  Default, technical assistance and 
25 termination are governed by this subsection.
26 A.  If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance 
27 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the 
28 commission shall:
29 (1)  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the 
30 nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any other action 
31 to be taken by the commission; and
32 (2)  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the 
33 default.
34 B.  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated 
35 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all 
36 rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the 
37 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state 
38 of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
39 C.  Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other 
40 means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or 
41 terminate must be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority 
42 leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and each of the member states.
Page 14 - 131LR0429(01)1 D.  A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and 
2 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that 
3 extend beyond the effective date of termination.
4 E.  The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in 
5 default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing 
6 between the commission and the defaulting state.
7 F.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the 
8 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where 
9 the commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing member must be awarded all 
10 costs of that litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
113.  Dispute resolution.  Dispute resolution is governed by this subsection.
12 A.  Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes 
13 related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and 
14 nonmember states.
15 B.  The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding 
16 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
174.  Enforcement.  Enforcement of the compact is governed by this subsection.
18 A.  The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the 
19 provisions and rules of this compact.
20 B.  By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States 
21 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission 
22 has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with 
23 the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought 
24 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is 
25 necessary, the prevailing member must be awarded all costs of that litigation, including 
26 reasonable attorney's fees.
27 C.  The remedies under this subsection are not the exclusive remedies of the 
28 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal 
29 or state law.
30§18712. Date of implementation of compact; associated rules; withdrawal; 
31amendment
321.  Effective date.  The compact takes effect on the date on which the compact statute 
33 is enacted into law in the 10th member state. The provisions of the compact that become 
34 effective at that time are limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to 
35 assembly and the promulgation of rules. After the effective date of the compact, the 
36 commission shall meet and exercise rule-making powers necessary to the implementation 
37 and administration of the compact.
382.  Subsequent member states.  Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the 
39 commission's initial adoption of the rules is subject to the rules as they exist on the date on 
40 which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by 
41 the commission has the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in 
42 that state.
Page 15 - 131LR0429(01)13.  Withdrawal.  Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a 
2 statute repealing the same.
3 A.  A member state's withdrawal does not take effect until 6 months after enactment of 
4 the repealing statute.
5 B.  Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's 
6 physical therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action 
7 reporting requirements of this chapter prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
84.  Other agreements or arrangements.  Nothing contained in this compact may be 
9 construed to invalidate or prevent any physical therapy licensure agreement or other 
10 cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not 
11 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
125.  Amendment.  This compact may be amended by the member states.  An amendment 
13 to this compact does not become effective and binding upon any member state until it is 
14 enacted into the laws of all member states.
15§18713. Construction and severability
16 This compact may be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The 
17 provisions of this compact must be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or 
18 provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or 
19 of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 
20 circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the 
21 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is not affected 
22 thereby.  If this compact is held contrary to the constitution of any party state, the compact 
23 remains in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect 
24 as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.
