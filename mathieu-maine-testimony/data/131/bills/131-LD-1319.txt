Page 1 - 131LR0896(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the economy of the State is reliant on many seasonal businesses that are 
4 open only a limited number of months during the calendar year; and
5Whereas, if the business of a seasonal business is disrupted, even for a brief period 
6 of time, it can be financially disastrous for the business due to the condensed period of time 
7 for the business to garner revenue; and
8Whereas, the business season for a summer seasonal business will be over before the 
9 expiration of the 90-day period; and
10Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
12 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
13 therefore,
14Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

19 business engaged in instruction in recreational activities.
20Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
