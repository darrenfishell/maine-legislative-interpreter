Page 1 - 131LR0019(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §6002, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
35.  Creation.  A lease agreement becomes a month-to-month tenancy at will if the lease 
4 agreement is not renewed or terminated upon its expiration, unless the landlord provides 
5 90 days' notice of termination of the lease and the tenant has at least 3 lease violations.
6Sec. 2.  14 MRSA §6002-A is enacted to read:
7§6002-A.  Termination of tenancy
8 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary and except as prohibited by the 
9 terms of a lease agreement, a landlord or tenant may terminate a tenancy in accordance 
10 with this section.
111. 30 days' notice. A landlord or tenant may terminate a tenancy with 30 days' written 
12 notice to the other party without a cause arising from the actions of the tenant if:
13 A.  The dwelling unit is located in a dwelling that is no larger than a 4-family dwelling 
14 and one of the units is occupied by the landlord;
15 B.  The landlord intends for the landlord or a member of the landlord's immediate 
16 family to occupy the dwelling unit as a primary residence and the landlord does not 
17 own a comparable unit within the same municipality that is available for occupancy at 
18 the time the tenant receives a notice to terminate the tenancy; or
19 C.  Notice is served upon the other party within 30 days of the annual anniversary date 
20 of the creation of a tenancy.
212. 90 days' notice.  Except as provided in subsection 3, a landlord may terminate a 
22 tenancy with 90 days' written notice to a tenant if the landlord pays the tenant an amount 
23 equal to one month's rent. 
243. Payment of one month's rent; exception.  A landlord that has an ownership interest 
25 in 4 or fewer dwelling units is not required to pay the tenant an amount equal to one month's 
26 rent in order to terminate a tenancy in accordance with subsection 2.
27Sec. 3.  14 MRSA §6016, as amended by PL 1985, c. 293, §5, is repealed and the 
28 following enacted in its place:
29§6016.  Rent increase limitations
30 This section governs limitations on rent increases.
311. Warranty of habitability.  Rent charged for residential estates may not be increased 
32 if the dwelling unit is in violation of the warranty of habitability. Any violation caused by 
33 the tenant, the tenant's family, guests or invitees may not bar a rent increase. A written or 
34 oral waiver of this requirement is against public policy and is void. A person in violation 
35 of this section is liable for the return of any sums unlawfully obtained from the lessee, with 
36 interest and reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
372. Annual limitation; maximum increase.  A landlord may not increase the rent on a 
38 dwelling unit more than once per year.  A rent increase under this subsection may not 
39 exceed 7% more than the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index as reported by 
40 the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The Maine State 
41 Housing Authority shall publish the maximum allowable rent increase percentage.
