Page 1 - 131LR0155(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA §101-D, sub-§4, ¶B, as amended by PL 2013, c. 265, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 B.  Upon a determination by the State Forensic Service under paragraph A, a court 
5 having jurisdiction in a criminal case may commit the defendant to the custody of the 
6 Commissioner of Health and Human Services for placement in an appropriate 
7 institution for the care and treatment of people with mental illness or in an appropriate 
8 residential program that provides care and treatment for persons who have intellectual 
9 disabilities or autism for observation for a period not to exceed 60 days.  If the State 
10 Forensic Service requires additional time for observation, it shall communicate its 
11 request and the reasons for that request to the court and to counsel for the parties.  The 
12 court shall accommodate a party's request to be heard on the issue of whether an 
13 extension should be granted and may extend the commitment for up to an additional 
14 90 days.  Unless the defendant objects, an order under this paragraph must authorize 
15 the institution or residential program where the defendant is placed by the 
16 Commissioner of Health and Human Services to provide treatment to the defendant.  
17 When further observation of the defendant is determined no longer necessary by the 
18 State Forensic Service, the commissioner Commissioner of Health and Human 
19 Services shall report that determination to the court and the court shall terminate the 
20 commitment.  If the defendant is committed by the court to the custody of the 
21 Commissioner of Health and Human Services for observation under this paragraph, the 
22 State Forensic Service may release prior court-ordered evaluation reports pertaining to 
23 the pending charges, unless otherwise impounded, to the institution or residential 
24 program into which the defendant is placed by the Commissioner of Health and Human 
25 Services.  If the defendant had been incarcerated prior to the commitment for 
26 observation and if, during the period of observation, the defendant presents a 
27 substantial risk of causing bodily injury to staff or others that cannot be managed in an 
28 appropriate institution for the care and treatment of people with mental illness or in an 
29 appropriate residential program that provides care and treatment for persons who have 
30 intellectual disabilities or autism, the commissioner Commissioner of Health and 
31 Human Services may return the defendant to the correctional facility.  The 
32 commissioner Commissioner of Health and Human Services shall report the risk 
33 management issues to the court. Upon receiving the report, the court shall review the 
34 report and may enter any order authorized by this section, including termination of the 
35 commitment.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill authorizes the State Forensic Service to disclose prior court-ordered 
38 evaluation reports pertaining to the pending changes of pretrial defendants to institutions 
39 for the care and treatment of people with mental illness or residential programs that provide 
40 care and treatment for persons who have intellectual disabilities or autism when the court 
41 commits a defendant to the Commissioner of Health and Human Services for observation 
42 in such an institution or program.37
