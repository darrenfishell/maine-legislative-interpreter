4SUMMARY
5 This bill extends the deadline for reporting the use of perfluoroalkyl and 
6 polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in products for sale until October 1, 2023. The bill 
7 authorizes reporting the amount of total organic fluorine if the amount of each PFAS 
8 compound is not known and allows the amount of PFAS to be reported based on 
9 information provided by a supplier rather than testing. The bill clarifies the packaging 
10 exemption and exempts manufacturers with less than $20,000,000 in annual national sales 
11 from the PFAS reporting requirements but not from any sales prohibitions. It requires the 
12 Department of Environmental Protection, not later than January 1, 2025 and every year 
13 thereafter until December 31, 2029, to adopt a rule identifying at least one product category 
14 or use that may not be sold, offered for sale or distributed in this State if it contains 
15 intentionally added PFAS. It prohibits the department prior to January 1, 2028 from 
16 providing an exemption for products in which the use of PFAS is a currently unavoidable 
17 use unless the department has adopted rules that identify a relevant related product category 
18 or use for a sales prohibition. The bill includes an appropriations and allocations section to 
19 provide funding for 2 positions and expenditures related to the implementation of the laws 
20 governing products containing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.1
