28 person from fairly participating in the criminal proceeding without counsel or who is a 
29 noncitizen for whom the criminal proceeding poses a risk of adverse immigration 
30 consequences. The bill also removes provisions that the court order reasonable 
31 compensation to counsel and updates outdated language.24
