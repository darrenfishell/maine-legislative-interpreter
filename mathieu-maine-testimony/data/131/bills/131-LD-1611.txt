27§1511-A.  Fitness to serve
28 The commission shall find a transmission and distribution utility with 50,000 or more 
29 customers unfit to serve and shall require and ensure the sale of the utility, to be completed 
30 within 24 months, if 4 or more of the following statements are true of the utility:
311.  Customer satisfaction.  The utility has been rated for 2 or more of the past 5 years 
32 among the lowest decile of utilities of a similar size for customer satisfaction on a nationally 
33 recognized survey of United States utility business or residential customers;
342.  Reliability.  The utility has been found by the commission or by the United States 
35 Energy Information Administration for 2 or more of the past 5 years to have overall 
36 reliability in terms of outage minutes per year, with or without major event days, in the 
37 lowest decile of utilities of a similar size in the country;
383.  Affordability.  In 2 or more of the past 5 years, the utility charged residential 
39 delivery rates reasonably estimated to be in the highest decile among utilities of a similar 
40 size in the country, based on data from the United States Energy Information 4

Page 2 - 131LR2471(01)41 Administration and based on the commission's analysis of average delivery rates as a 
42 proportion of the average total bill for integrated utilities;

5 qualified, nonexempt employees of the utility;
65.  Security.  The utility owns critical infrastructure vital to the security and welfare of 
7 the State and is presently owned, either wholly or in a part greater than 5%, by a government 
8 that does not represent or govern the captive customers of the utility;
96.  Customer obligations.  The utility, due to its corporate structure, requires that 
10 customers pay for the cost of the utility's corporate taxes, and also pay for shareholder 
11 profits exceeding 10% on prudent capital investment in transmission infrastructure, with 
12 little to no risk for poor performance;
137.  Disaster assistance.  The utility, due to its corporate structure, may require that 
14 customers pay directly or indirectly for 90% or more of damages to the utility's assets 
15 caused by extreme weather events, and may also deny the utility access to federal 
16 emergency management assistance to reduce or eliminate these costs; or
178.  Priorities.  The utility, due to its corporate structure and fiduciary obligations, is 
18 unable to place the needs of customers, workers or the State's climate and connectivity 
19 goals ahead of the desires of shareholders to earn a profit.

14§4003.  Powers and duties; acquisition of utility facilities and utility property
151.  Powers; generally.  The company is a consumer-owned transmission and 
16 distribution utility and has all the powers and duties of a transmission and distribution 
17 utility under this Title, as affected by the provisions of chapter 35, within the service 
18 territories of the investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities whose utility 
19 facilities it acquires under this chapter.
202.  Limits on company; generating property.  The company may not own or operate 
21 a generating source or purchase electric capacity or energy from a generating source, except 
22 as the commission may approve in order to allow the company to maintain or improve 
23 system reliability.
243.  Private sector, competitive, performance-based operations.  The company shall 
25 contract by means of a competitive public solicitation the services of at least one qualified 
26 nongovernmental entity, referred to in this chapter as "the operator" or "the operations 
27 team," to provide cost-effective, private sector operations, maintenance, customer accounts 
28 management and customer service and information and to assist as necessary in regulatory 
29 affairs, capital planning and administrative services.  The company may not contract with 
30 an operator that has managed a company found to be unfit within the previous 10 years.  
31 The company may contract with separate operators for each of the service territories of the 
32 acquired utilities, or to meet discrete operations, maintenance or other requirements.  In 
33 requesting and evaluating bids pursuant to this section, the board shall consider anticipated 
34 costs; professional, operational and managerial experience; familiarity with the systems to 
35 be administered; and ability to improve customer service and employee morale.  The 
36 company may establish additional criteria for its solicitation and shall determine the period 
37 and the specific terms of each operations contract.  The commission shall review and 
38 approve, reject or approve with conditions any contract between the company and an 
39 operator before it takes effect.  A contract with an operations team must reward proven 
40 performance, not the provision of capital, and must provide for the efficient and effective 
41 fulfillment of the company's purposes under section 4002.
424.  Retention of employees.  The operator shall hire any person who was an employee 
43 of the acquired utility at the time the company acquired the utility facilities who is a 
44 qualified, nonexempt employee subject to collective bargaining agreements of the acquired 
45 utility and may hire any other person who was an employee of the acquired utility with the 
Page 7 - 131LR2471(01)46 exception of those employees on the executive board of the acquired utility.  To ensure 
47 continuity and an experienced local workforce, the operations team shall offer to these 
48 employees a retention bonus of 8% of annual gross pay for the first year of work and 6% 
49 of annual gross pay for the 2nd year of work.  This bonus must be payable on the earlier of 
50 the anniversary of the date of hire by the operator and the date of a termination of 
51 employment that occurs following the date of hire, as long as the termination is due to the 
52 employee's death or disability, by the employer without cause or by the employee for good 
53 reason.  The operations team shall maximize opportunities for internal promotion, 
54 additional staffing and on-the-job training for all employees and may not contract with 
55 other businesses to perform work that could reasonably have been performed by qualified, 
56 nonexempt employees of the operations team.
125.  Rights of employees.  The employees of the operations team retained to operate the 
13 company's facilities are private employees.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the 
14 contrary, the company shall at a minimum accord all qualified, nonexempt employees and 
15 their representatives the same rights as would an investor-owned transmission and 
16 distribution utility.  The operator may not limit or impair the ability and right of its 
17 employees to strike or to engage in any work stoppage or slowdown and may not hire 
18 replacement employees permanently during an employee strike.  The operator shall notify 
19 employee representatives of new hires and shall allow representatives of employees 
20 reasonable access to work sites during work hours.  The operator shall assume all retirement 
21 benefit obligations to the employees of and retirees of an acquired utility, unless these 
22 obligations have remained with the acquired utility, its corporate parent or a pension plan 
23 trust regulated by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  The 
24 operator shall honor and maintain the terms of any collective bargaining agreements in 
25 effect at the time the company acquired the investor-owned transmission and distribution 
26 utility for the remaining term of any collective bargaining agreement, except that, when 2 
27 or more contracts exist, the employees' wages, salaries and benefits must be made 
28 reasonably equal to the higher of those provided in the contracts or must exceed those 
29 previously paid by the acquired utility.
30 Upon the conclusion of a contract pursuant to subsection 3, the company, in soliciting for 
31 a new contract, shall give preference to service providers that agree to maintain or improve 
32 the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in existence on the conclusion of the prior 
33 contract.
346.  Acquisition of utility facilities and utility property.  Notwithstanding any other 
35 provision of this Title, rules adopted under this Title or any other applicable law to the 
36 contrary, the company shall purchase or acquire by the exercise of the right of eminent 
37 domain all utility facilities in the State owned or operated or held for future use by any 
38 investor-owned transmission and distribution utility, in accordance with this subsection, 
39 and may also purchase or acquire by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in 
40 accordance with this subsection any other investor-owned transmission and distribution 
41 utility property should the board determine such an acquisition to be in the interest of its 
42 customer-owners.  The company shall finance the purchase or acquisition of utility 
43 facilities or utility property under this subsection by issuing debt in accordance with chapter 
44 9.  The board may not purchase or acquire by the right of eminent domain any utility 
45 facilities or utility property under this subsection until 12 months after the effective date of 
46 this chapter or 6 months after the first meeting of the board, whichever is later.1

Page 8 - 131LR2471(01)1 A.  Within 18 months after the effective date of this chapter or 12 months after the first 
2 meeting of the board, whichever is later, unless further delayed to a date certain by a 
3 vote of at least 9 members of the board, the company shall:
4 (1)  Identify the utility facilities and any other utility property in the State owned 
5 or operated or held for future use by any investor-owned transmission and 
6 distribution utility to be purchased by the company;
7 (2)  Determine a purchase price offer to be made for the utility facilities and other 
8 utility property.  The purchase price offer must include compensation for the cost 
9 of preparing and submitting necessary regulatory filings, including but not limited 
10 to those required by the federal Department of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory 
11 Commission; and
12 (3)  Deliver notice of the purchase price offer, including detailed description of the 
13 utility facilities and other utility property to be purchased, to the investor-owned 
14 transmission and distribution utility that owns, operates or holds for future use the 
15 subject utility facilities and utility property.
16 By a vote of at least 9 members of the board, the company may delay by up to one year 
17 the purchase of the utility facilities and any other utility property of one of the 2 
18 investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities in the State and proceed with the 
19 purchase of the utility facilities and any other utility property of the other investor-
20 owned transmission and distribution utility in the State.  A delay approved by the board 
21 under this paragraph may be renewed once in the same manner for up to one additional 
22 year.
23 B.  After the receipt of a notice of the purchase price offer under paragraph A, 
24 subparagraph (3), the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility may, within 
25 30 days of the date of receipt, submit a counteroffer to the company.  If the company 
26 rejects the counteroffer, within 30 days of the date of receipt of the rejection the 
27 investor-owned transmission and distribution utility may petition the Superior Court of 
28 Kennebec County to determine and order an alternative purchase price for the subject 
29 utility facilities or utility property in accordance with this paragraph.  The purchase 
30 price determined by the court must include compensation for the cost of preparing and 
31 submitting necessary regulatory filings, including but not limited to those required by 
32 the federal Department of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  After the 
33 filing of a petition by an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility under this 
34 paragraph, the Superior Court, as expeditiously as possible, shall:
35 (1)  Select, in consultation with the company and the petitioner, a referee or referees 
36 with relevant expertise and capabilities to determine a recommended purchase 
37 price for the utility facilities and utility property;
38 (2)  Complete a trial or hearing, as appropriate, for the presentation of evidence to 
39 referees, who shall submit a recommended purchase price to the court; and
40 (3)  Render a decision and, based upon the recommended purchase price submitted 
41 under subparagraph (2) and any other information available to the court, order a 
42 purchase price to be paid by the company to the petitioner for possession and 
43 ownership of the subject utility facilities and utility property.
Page 9 - 131LR2471(01)1 The decision of the Superior Court under this paragraph is appealable to the Law Court 
2 as in any civil action.
3 C.  The taking of utility facilities and utility property by the company is governed by 
4 this paragraph.
5 (1)  Notwithstanding chapter 65 or any other provision of law to the contrary, if a 
6 petition is filed under paragraph B and if the company and subject utilities do not 
7 reach an agreement, the company shall, after any appeals are resolved, immediately 
8 take the subject utility facilities and utility property identified in paragraph A at the 
9 final price rendered by the court.
10 (2)  Notwithstanding chapter 65 or any other provision of law to the contrary, if a 
11 petition is not filed under paragraph B and if the company and subject utilities do 
12 not reach an agreement, the company shall immediately take the subject utility 
13 facilities and utility property identified in paragraph A at the purchase price offer.
14 Within 45 days of the date upon which the purchase price is either mutually agreed upon 
15 by the company and the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility or is finally 
16 determined through the judicial process set forth under paragraph B, the investor-owned 
17 transmission and distribution utility shall prepare and submit any regulatory filings 
18 necessary to the transfer of subject utility facilities and utility property, including but not 
19 limited to those required by the federal Department of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory 
20 Commission.  If the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility does not prepare 
21 and submit such filings within 45 days, the company may request that the commission 
22 investigate the utility's failure to prepare and submit the filings.  Upon such a request from 
23 the company, the commission shall, in a timely manner, investigate the utility's failure to 
24 prepare and submit the filings.  If the commission finds the investor-owned transmission 
25 and distribution utility unreasonably delayed or failed to prepare and submit the filings, or 
26 failed to prosecute and pursue federal regulatory approvals of the transfer in good faith, the 
27 commission shall direct the utility to do so by a date certain and may order other remedies, 
28 including deducting the cost of preparing and submitting such regulatory filings from the 
29 purchase price or otherwise preventing the utility from recouping the cost and requiring the 
30 utility to pay for costs to other parties caused by the delay.
31 If at any time during the process prescribed in this subsection the company and either of 
32 the investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities reach an agreement on the 
33 purchase price of all utility facilities and utility property in the State owned or operated or 
34 held for future use by that investor-owned transmission and distribution utility, the sale 
35 may be finalized in accordance with that agreement.
36 The commission shall impose such conditions on the acquisition of all utility facilities and 
37 utility property in the State owned or operated or held for future use by any investor-owned 
38 transmission and distribution utility as it determines are necessary to protect the public 
39 interest during the period between the effective date of this chapter and the date on which 
40 ownership and control are fully assumed by the company and the operations team.  The 
41 commission shall take all necessary actions to ensure that the investor-owned transmission 
42 and distribution utilities and their owners cooperate fully, promptly and cost-effectively 
43 with the company during the transition in ownership and control. The commission may 
44 allow recovery by or reimbursement to the utility of necessary expenses associated with 
45 the transition.  At a minimum, the utility must be required to plan, construct, operate and 
Page 10 - 131LR2471(01)46 maintain facilities and to cooperate with customers, generators and other stakeholders to 
47 the same extent that the commission would require of any transmission and distribution 
48 utility and to provide the company such information as may be necessary to meet its 
49 responsibilities under this Title, including but not limited to a detailed inventory of assets.
57.  Existing obligations.  All existing agreements, obligations and contracts, including 
6 but not limited to long-term contract obligations and net energy billing agreements of an 
7 investor-owned transmission and distribution utility, must be transferred to the company 
8 and any counterparty to an agreement, obligation or contract shall accept the assignment of 
9 the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility to the company.

12 changed by majority vote of the board.

14 distinguish its service territories or for any other purpose.
1510.  Rules.  The company may adopt rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 
16 2-A for establishing and administering the company and carrying out its duties.  Rules

25 responsibilities of any consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility other than 
26 the company created under this chapter.  The company may not oppose the extension 
27 of the service territory of a consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility 
28 existing prior to the effective date of this chapter to include the entirety of a 
29 municipality in which the consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility 
30 provides electric service as long as the company is reasonably compensated for the 
31 assets and appurtenances required.
32 B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or any other provision of law 
33 to the contrary, the company is subject to section 310; section 3104; section 3132,

40 the Treasurer of State, the Office of the Attorney General, the Maine Municipal Bond Bank,

Page 11 - 131LR2471(01)45 transmission and distribution utility facilities and utility property.  Notwithstanding any 
46 provision of the law to the contrary, debt incurred by the board for its initial activities and 
47 expenditures is presumed to be prudently incurred on behalf of the customers of the 
48 investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities and is recoverable in rates, except 
49 where proven to be imprudent beyond a reasonable doubt. To the extent that the company's 
50 initial activities are specifically attributable to one but not both acquired utilities, those 
51 separately attributable costs must be recovered from ratepayers of the utility to which they 
52 are attributable.

13 Debt or liability of the company is not a general obligation or moral obligation of the 
14 State or any agency or instrumentality of the State other than the company, and neither the 
15 State nor any agency or instrumentality of the State other than the company guarantees any 
16 debt or liability of the company.

25§4008.  Property and income tax status
261.  Property tax.  Notwithstanding Title 36, chapter 105, subchapter 4, the company 
27 is subject to property taxation pursuant to the laws of the State and must pay property tax 
28 in the same manner as an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility.  Rates 
29 charged by the company must include sufficient amounts to pay property taxes due under 
30 this subsection.
312.  Income tax.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, income of the 
32 company is exempt from all taxation or assessment by the State or any political subdivision 
33 of the State.  All bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness issued by the company 
34 in accordance with chapter 9 are legal obligations of the company, and the company is a 
35 quasi-municipal corporation within the meaning and for the purposes of Title 30-A, section

383.  Tax increment financing agreements.  If an investor-owned transmission and 
39 distribution utility acquired by the company is subject to a tax increment financing

41 responsibilities as applied to the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility under 
42 the agreement.1

30SUMMARY
31 This initiated bill creates the Pine Tree Power Company, a privately operated, 
32 nonprofit, consumer-owned utility controlled by a board the majority of the members of 
33 which are elected.  The company's purposes are to provide for its customer-owners in this 
34 State reliable, affordable electric transmission and distribution services and to help the State 
35 meet its climate, energy and connectivity goals in the most rapid and affordable manner 
36 possible.
37 The Pine Tree Power Company is not permitted to use general obligation bonds or tax 
38 dollars of the State.  The company finances itself by issuing debt against its future revenues 
39 to purchase the facilities of investor-owned electric transmission and distribution utilities 
40 in the State.  The fair market value of the acquisition is either negotiated or determined by 
41 a refereed process.  The Pine Tree Power Company Board contracts a nongovernmental 
42 team to operate the facilities, and the operations team is required to retain all workers of 
43 the purchased utilities.1

Page 15 - 131LR2471(01)1 The company is subject to property taxation and must pay property tax in the same 
2 manner as an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility.  The company is subject 
3 to ratemaking and other oversight by the Public Utilities Commission and is required to 
4 administer programs for net energy billing, nonwires alternatives, supply procurement and 
5 low-income assistance programs.
6 The company is governed by a board of 13 members, 7 of whom are each elected to 
7 represent 5 State Senate districts, as well as 6 designated expert members.  The board is 
8 subject to freedom of access laws and to laws preventing conflicts of interest.
9 The initiated bill also directs the Public Utilities Commission beginning January 1, 
10 2025 to find a transmission and distribution utility unfit to serve and to direct the sale of 
11 the utility if the utility meets certain criteria.
