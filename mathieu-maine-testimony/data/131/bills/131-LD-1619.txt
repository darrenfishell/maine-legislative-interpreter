2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §1596, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2019, c. 262, §1, is repealed 
3 and the following enacted in its place:
42.  Abortion reports.  A report of each abortion performed must be made to the 
5 Department of Health and Human Services in a manner prescribed by the department. 
6 These reports may not identify the patient by name or include other identifying information. 
7 The report must include, without limitation, the following information:
8 A.  The date and place the abortion was performed;
9 B.  The age of the person on whom the abortion was performed;
10 C.  The method used to perform the abortion; and 
11 D.  The gestational age of the fetus when the abortion was performed.
12 The report containing the information and data required by this subsection must be 
13 transmitted by the health care provider to the department not later than 10 days following 
14 the end of the month in which the abortion is performed.
15Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §1598, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2019, c. 262, §4, is further 
16 amended to read:
171.  Policy.  It is the public policy of the State that the State not restrict a woman's 
18 exercise of her private decision to terminate a pregnancy before viability except as provided 
19 in section 1597‑A.  After viability an abortion may be performed only when it is necessary 
20 to preserve the life or health of the mother  in the professional judgment of a physician 
21 licensed pursuant to Title 32, chapter 36 or 48. It is also the public policy of the State that 
22 all abortions may be performed only by a health care professional, as defined in section 
23 1596, subsection 1, paragraph C.
24Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §1598, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2019, c. 262, §5, is further

34Sec. 4.  22 MRSA §1598, sub-§4, as corrected by RR 2021, c. 2, Pt. B, §98, is 
35 repealed.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill amends the law governing abortion reports to eliminate the requirement to use 
38 the United States Standard Report of Induced Termination of Pregnancy and replace it with 
39 a report that may not contain any information that identifies the patient but must contain 37
38
39
Page 2 - 131LR2454(01)40 specific data such as the date and place the abortion was performed; the age of the patient; 
41 the method used to perform the abortion; and the gestational age of the fetus at the time of 
42 the abortion.
4 This bill changes the standard for when an abortion may be performed after viability 
5 to when a licensed physician determines that it is necessary instead of when it is necessary 
6 to preserve the life or health of the mother.
7 Finally, this bill removes the criminal penalties for performing an abortion without 
8 being licensed as a physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse and 
9 for performing an abortion after viability of the fetus when it was not necessary for the 
10 preservation of the life or health of the mother.1
