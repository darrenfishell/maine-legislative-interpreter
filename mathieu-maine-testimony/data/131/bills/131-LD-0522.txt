Page 1 - 131LR1647(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA ยง2396, sub-ยง2, as amended by PL 2001, c. 144, ยง2, is further 
3 amended to read:
42.  Unsecured load.  A person may not operate on a public way a vehicle with a load 
5 that is not fastened, secured, confined or loaded to reasonably prevent a portion from falling 
6 off.
7 For the purposes of this section, "load" includes, but is not limited to, snow that has 
8 naturally accumulated on the top of a vehicle, snow that is part of an actual load, firewood, 
9 pulpwood, logs, bolts or other material, but does not include loose hay, pea vines, straw, 
10 grain or cornstalks.
11 When the load consists of sawdust, shavings or wood chips, and a reasonable effort has 
12 been made to completely cover the load, minor amounts blown from the vehicle while in 
13 transit do not constitute a violation.  With regard to snow that has accumulated on the top 
14 of a vehicle naturally, a person may not be cited for violating this subsection during a snow 
15 event.  For the purposes of this subsection, "snow event" means the day of and the 48-hour 
16 period after a snowstorm that took place in the area.
17 A violation of this section is a traffic infraction subject to a forfeiture  fine of not less than 
18 $150 nor more than $500.
19SUMMARY
20 This bill prohibits a person from operating on a public way a vehicle with a load of 
21 unsecured snow or a vehicle that has naturally accumulated snow on top of the vehicle, 
22 except that, with regard to snow that has accumulated naturally, a driver may not be cited 
23 during a snowstorm and the 48-hour period after the snowstorm that took place in the area.20
