61.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
7 following terms have the following meanings.
8 A.  "Low-impact landscaping" means landscaping techniques that conserve water, 
9 lower maintenance costs, provide pollution prevention and create habitat for wildlife.  
10 "Low-impact landscaping" includes gardens and other features designed to attract 
11 wildlife generally and pollinator species more specifically; rain gardens and other 
12 features that use natural biological principles to return rainwater to the soil and to filter 
13 rainwater of excess nutrients; and other forms of landscaping or gardening that reduce 
14 or eliminate the need for supplemental water from irrigation.
15 B.  "Restriction on use" includes any covenant, restriction or condition contained in a 
16 deed, declaration, contract, condominium or homeowners association bylaws or rule or 
17 security instrument or other instrument affecting the transfer or sale of real property or 
18 other interest in real property.
19 C.  "Unreasonable limitation" includes a limitation that significantly increases the cost 
20 of low-impact landscaping, significantly decreases the efficiency of low-impact 
21 landscaping or requires cultivated vegetation to consist in whole or in part of turf grass.
222.  Prohibition.  A restriction on use regarding real property may not put an 
23 unreasonable limitation on low-impact landscaping if the property owner owns or has the 
24 right to exclusive use of the property and maintains and regularly tends to the low-impact 
25 landscaping.
263.  Construction; application.  This section may not be construed to prohibit a 
27 restriction on use from including reasonable design and aesthetic guidelines regarding the 
28 type, number and location of low-impact landscaping features.  This section does not apply 
29 to a restriction on use on historic property that is listed in or determined by the Maine 
30 Historic Preservation Commission to be eligible for inclusion in the National Register of 
31 Historic Places.
32SUMMARY
33 This bill prohibits certain restrictions on landscaping techniques that conserve water, 
34 lower maintenance costs, provide pollution prevention and create habitat for wildlife.  The 
35 restrictions that are prohibited are those that would increase costs, decrease efficiency or 
36 require the use in whole or in part of turf grass.33
