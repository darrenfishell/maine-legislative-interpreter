3 amended to read:
41.  Credit allowed.  A taxpayer is allowed a credit against the tax due under this Part 
5 equal to the sum of 5%  10% of the excess, if any, of the qualified research expenses for the 
6 taxable year over the base amount and 7.5%  15% of the basic research payments 
7 determined under the Code, Section 41(e)(1)(A).  The term "base amount" means 50% of

10 indicates, the terms "qualified research expenses," "qualified organization base period 
11 amount," "basic research" and any other terms affecting the calculation of the credit have 
12 the same meanings as under the Code, Section 41, but apply only to expenditures for 
13 research conducted in this State.  In determining the amount of the credit allowable under 
14 this section, the State Tax Assessor may aggregate the activities of all corporations that are 
15 members of a controlled group of corporations, as defined by the Code, Section 41(f)(1)(A) 
16 and in addition may aggregate the activities of all entities, whether or not incorporated, that 
17 are under common control, as defined by the Code, Section 41(f)(1)(B).

203.  Limitation on credit allowed.  The credit allowed under this section is limited to 
21 100% of a corporation's first $25,000  $50,000 of tax due, as determined before the 
22 allowance of any credits, plus 75% of the corporation's tax due, as determined in excess of 
23 $25,000  $50,000.  The assessor shall adopt rules similar to those authorized under the Code, 
24 Section 38(c)(5)(B) for purposes of apportioning the $25,000  $50,000 among members of 
25 a controlled group.
