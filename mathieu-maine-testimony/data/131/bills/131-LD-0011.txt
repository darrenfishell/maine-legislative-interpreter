Page 1 - 131LR0149(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §1321, sub-§3-A is enacted to read:
33-A.  Notice to owner; interim controls.  The department may order the owner to 
4 implement lead exposure reduction actions or interim controls as determined by the 
5 department with reasonable notice until the owner is able to remove, replace or securely 
6 and permanently cover lead-based substances.  In order to determine the effectiveness of 
7 the actions taken or interim controls, the department may inspect the dwelling, premises, 
8 residential child-occupied facility, child care facility, premises of the family child care 
9 provider or nursery school;
10Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §1322, 2nd ¶, as amended by PL 2003, c. 421, §9, is further 
11 amended to read:
12 Until the owner brings any residential dwelling or premises into compliance with this 
13 Act while a tenant is occupying a dwelling unit, the owner shall move the tenant to a 
14 substitute dwelling unit upon reasonable notice.  The department may, on a case-by-case 
15 basis, waive this requirement if the department determines that the implementation of 
16 actions to reduce lead exposure or interim controls sufficiently protects the residents of the 
17 unit until full abatement is achieved.  Pursuant to section 1321, subsection 3-A, the 
18 department may order the owner to implement lead exposure reduction actions or interim 
19 controls as determined by the department with reasonable notice.  The owner shall pay 
20 reasonable moving expenses and any use and occupancy charges for a substitute dwelling 
21 unit that exceed the rent for the vacated dwelling unit for which the tenant remains 
22 responsible.  "Substitute dwelling unit" means a dwelling unit of like or similar 
23 accommodation and in like or similar location that is lead-safe.  If the tenant fails to accept 
24 the substitute dwelling unit selected by the owner while the owner is required to bring the 
25 vacated dwelling unit into compliance with this Act or the tenant fails to remain current in 
26 rent pursuant to the lease or tenancy at will under Title 14, section 6002, including the 
27 statutory period of right to cure, the owner is not obligated beyond 10 days after completion 
28 of remediation to reimburse the tenant for any expense or inconvenience other than moving 
29 expenses and any use and occupancy charges for the substitute dwelling unit selected by 
30 the owner that exceed the rent for the vacated dwelling unit.
31SUMMARY
32 This bill establishes the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services to 
33 order and enforce actions to temporarily protect children and families living in any 
34 residential dwelling unit from identified lead hazards until they are relocated to lead-safe 
35 housing or lead hazards are abated.32
