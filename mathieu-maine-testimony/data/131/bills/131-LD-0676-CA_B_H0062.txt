Potential current biennium revenue decrease -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill repeals the exception in current law that permits a financial institution or credit union to disclose financia 1 
records about a customer without a lawful subpoena, smmnons, warrant or court order in response to a request for 
infonnation related to establishing, modifying or enforcing tax liabilities. The Department of Adminstrative and 
Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue Services anticipates that the repeal is likely to reduce tax revenue by limiting 
its ability to match data with financial institutions relating to outstanding tax liabilities. Total tax revenue collections 
attributable to data matching with financial institutions was $6.0 million in fiscal year 2021-22 and $6.8 million in 
fiscal year 2020-21. The amount of the revenue decrease going forward will depend on the degree to which data 
matching is limited and cannot be detennined at this time.
