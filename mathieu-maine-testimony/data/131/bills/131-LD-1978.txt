4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill would enact the Reentry Success and Earned Time Act to establish in statute 
6 the reentry programs currently offered by the Department of Corrections, including but not 
7 limited to vocational and educational programs.  The bill would establish certificate 
8 programs for those reentry programs for any resident of the Maine State Prison.  The bill 
9 would specify that a resident of the Maine State Prison may not be denied access to a reentry 
10 program based on the resident's actual or perceived race, color, sex, sexual orientation, 
11 gender identity, physical or mental disability, religion, ancestry or national origin, age or 
12 familial status.  Successful completion of a reentry program would count toward a resident's 
13 time served.  The Department of Corrections would be required to establish standards for 
14 successful completion of a reentry program.4
