16SUMMARY
17 Current law requires persons attempting to pass vehicles used to assist members of the 
18 public or law enforcement officers with disabled vehicles or to remove debris from a 
19 roadway, including wreckers, or vehicles used to construct, maintain, inspect or repair 
20 utility infrastructure to do so in a nonadjacent lane when possible or at a careful and prudent 
21 speed if the vehicles are using their authorized lights.  This bill adds similar requirements 
22 for persons attempting to pass business vehicles used to transport refuse, garbage, compost, 
23 recycling or trash.  The bill also clarifies that business vehicles used to transport compost 
24 or recycling may be equipped with auxiliary lights that emit a flashing amber light. 17
