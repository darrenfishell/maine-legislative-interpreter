61-A.  Limitation on emergency powers.  The exercise of any emergency power a state 
7 or local official may have under the Constitution of Maine or the laws of this State that 
8 binds or regulates the public is limited as provided in this subsection.
9 A.  As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following 
10 terms have the following meanings.
11 (1)  "Constitutional right" means any right guaranteed under the United States 
12 Constitution or the Constitution of Maine, including, but not limited to, the right 
13 to:
14 (a) Travel, work, assemble and speak;
15 (b) Exercise religion without government interference;

17 (d) Be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; and

19 (2) "Emergency order" means an order, decree, regulation or other mandate 
20 proclaimed or promulgated by a state or local official.
21 (3)  "State or local official" means the Governor, a person within the executive 
22 branch or an elected or appointed member of a municipal government.
23 B.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an emergency order that is 
24 issued by a state or local official that binds, curtails or infringes on the rights of private 
25 parties must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose. 
26 Only the Governor may issue an order that infringes on constitutional rights, and that 
27 order must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose.  
28 Each emergency order must be limited in duration, applicability and scope in order to 
29 reduce any infringement of the rights of private parties or constitutional rights.
30 C.  A court of this State has jurisdiction to hear a case challenging the legality of an 
31 emergency order, including compliance with the limitations imposed on emergency

33 brought pursuant to this paragraph to the extent practicable. Inequality in the 
34 applicability of the impact of emergency orders on analogous groups, situations and

37 narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose.

Page 3 - 131LR1459(01)1 (2)  The enforcement powers granted in sections 786 and 829, unless the Governor 
2 specifically invokes these powers by an order issued pursuant to an energy 
3 emergency proclamation and approved by a majority  2/3 of the membership of the 
4 Legislative Council.  That order must specify those emergency orders or rules that 
5 are enforceable pursuant to this paragraph and must further specify the 
6 enforcement activities emergency management organizations are to pursue.  No 
7 An enforcement action may  not be taken pursuant to this paragraph without 
8 publication of the order authorizing the action in a manner reasonably calculated 
9 to give affected persons adequate notice of the order or rule to be enforced, which 
10 may include publication on the Internet, and the sanctions to be applied.   
11 Publication of the order may include publication on the Internet.
12Sec. 12.  37-B MRSA §743, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1983, c. 594, §34, is amended

17 of the Legislature.  If the renewal is rejected by the Legislature, the Governor shall issue 
18 an executive proclamation ending the state of emergency within 24 hours of the rejection.  
19 A new state of emergency may not be declared for at least 30 days without approval by a 
20 majority vote of each House of the Legislature.  The Legislature, by joint resolution, may 
21 terminate a state of emergency at anytime  any time.  Thereupon, the  The Governor shall

24 of emergency by a majority vote of each House of the Legislature.  This subsection does 
25 not apply to the Governor's powers under chapter 3.
26Sec. 13.  37-B MRSA §821, as enacted by PL 1983, c. 460, §3 and corrected by RR

28SUMMARY
29 This bill:
30 1. Requires the emergency powers exercised by the Governor, a person within the 
31 executive branch or a municipal official that bind, curtail or infringe on the rights of private 
32 parties to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose and to 
33 be limited in duration, applicability and scope to reduce any infringement of individual 
34 liberty.  Only the Governor may issue an order that infringes on a right guaranteed under 
35 the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Maine, including, but not limited to, 
36 freedom of travel, assembly, work, speech and religion and freedom to purchase and 
37 possess firearms and ammunition.  That order must be narrowly tailored to serve a 
38 compelling public health or safety purpose limited in duration, applicability and scope to 
39 reduce any infringement of a constitutional right;
40 2. Gives a state court jurisdiction to hear a case challenging the legality of the exercise 
41 of emergency powers and requires the court to expedite consideration of the case to the 
42 extent practicable.  Inequality in the applicability of the impact of emergency orders on 
43 analogous groups, situations and circumstances may constitute one ground among others 29

4 is to be in effect for longer than 30 days.  If the Legislature does not, by a 2/3 vote in each 
5 House of the Legislature, vote to extend the state of emergency, the Governor may not 
6 declare a similar, subsequent state of emergency;
7 4. Requires the Governor to convene the Legislature if, after a state of emergency is 
8 declared, an order issued by the Governor is to be in effect for longer than 90 days.  The 
9 Legislature must, by a 2/3 vote in each House of the Legislature, vote to approve the 
10 Governor's authority to extend that order;
11 5. Provides that the Governor may not reissue or renew an emergency proclamation 
12 that is substantially similar to one that expired or reissue an emergency proclamation 
13 terminated by the Legislature without approval of the Legislature; and

15 proclamations by:
16 A. Removing the authority of the Governor to obtain and acquire property;

27 limitations on the occupancy of premises that would have a substantial impact on the 
28 operation of businesses; and

30 abate, clean up or mitigate a danger would result in the temporary or permanent closure 
31 of any business or civic or religious organization.1
