Page 1 - 131LR1094(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§2, ¶D, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 272, §1, is amended 
3 to read:
4 D.  That all tips received by the affected employee must be retained by the employee, 
5 except for a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and 
6 regularly receive tips in accordance with subsection 2‑A;
7Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§2-A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 10, §1, is further 
8 amended to read:
92-A.  Tip pooling.  This section may not be construed to prohibit an employer from 
10 establishing a valid tip pooling arrangement only among service employees that does not 
11 violate the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and regulations made pursuant to that 
12 Act.
13SUMMARY
14 Current federal regulations specify that if an employer pays its employees the full 
15 minimum wage and does not take a tip credit, the employer may impose a tip pooling 
16 arrangement to include employees that are not classified as service employees, such as 
17 dishwashers and cooks. This bill amends the law to reflect that ability.14
