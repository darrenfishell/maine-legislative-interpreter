Page 1 - 131LR0029(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §683, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 478, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Exemption amount.  Except as provided in subsection 1-C and except for 
5 assessments for special benefits, the just value of $10,000 of the homestead of a permanent 
6 resident of this State who has owned a homestead in this State for the preceding 12 months 
7 is exempt from taxation.  Notwithstanding this subsection, a permanent resident of this 
8 State who loses ownership of a homestead in this State due to a tax lien foreclosure and 
9 subsequently regains ownership of the homestead from the municipality that foreclosed on 
10 the tax lien is deemed to have continuously owned the homestead and may not be 
11 determined ineligible for the exemption provided in this section due to the ownership of 
12 the homestead by the municipality.  In determining the local assessed value of the 
13 exemption, the assessor shall multiply the amount of the exemption by the ratio of current 
14 just value upon which the assessment is based as furnished in the assessor's annual return 
15 pursuant to section 383.  If the title to the homestead is held by the applicant jointly or in 
16 common with others, the exemption may not exceed $10,000 of the just value of the 
17 homestead, but may be apportioned among the owners who reside on the property to the 
18 extent of their respective interests.  A municipality responsible for administering the 
19 homestead exemption has no obligation to create separate accounts for each partial interest 
20 in a homestead owned jointly or in common.
21Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §683, sub-§1-C is enacted to read:
221-C.  Exemption amount for persons over 65 years of age.  Notwithstanding 
23 subsections 1 and 1-B, for property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2024, the 
24 exemption amount for a homestead of a permanent resident of this State who is 65 years of 
25 age or older and who has resided in the homestead for at least the preceding 10 years is the 
26 just value of $75,000.
27Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §6281, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 751, §1, is amended by enacting 
28 at the end a new paragraph to read:
29 This chapter applies only to the property tax year beginning April 1, 2023.
30SUMMARY
31 This bill provides that the law enacted in 2022 providing a process for stabilization of 
32 property taxes for permanent residents of this State who are 65 years of age or older and 
33 have owned a homestead in the State for at least 10 years applies only to the property tax 
34 year beginning April 1, 2023. For property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2024, 
35 the bill replaces the stabilization program with  an increased homestead property tax 
36 exemption of $75,000 just value.31
