6 A.  "Buyer" means a person that, after a sale, transfer or exchange, is the owner of the 
7 firearm subject to the sale, transfer or exchange.
8 B.  "Family member" means a spouse, domestic partner, parent, stepparent, foster 
9 parent, child, stepchild, foster child or any other person related by consanguinity up to 
10 the 2nd degree.  For purposes of this paragraph, "domestic partner" has the same 
11 meaning as in Title 1, section 72, subsection 2-C.
12 C.  "Federally licensed firearms dealer" or "dealer" means a person who is licensed or 
13 is required to be licensed as a dealer under 18 United States Code, Section 923.

22 Instant Criminal Background Check System of the buyer in the same manner as if the dealer 
23 were the seller of the firearm that is the subject of the transaction.  If the criminal

25 shall notify the seller of that fact.  The dealer may charge a reasonable fee for serving as 
26 the facilitator.
273.  Limitations.  This section applies only to transactions in which:

36 intent to sell, transfer or exchange, a firearm.
