2water utility

4 consolidation of the consumer-owned water utilities into a single consumer-owned water 
5 utility, the commission shall initiate a proceeding to determine whether the proposed 
6 consolidation is in the public interest.
72.  Differing rates request.  Two or more consumer-owned water utilities may request 
8 in the petition submitted in accordance with subsection 1 to have differing geographically 
9 based rate structures consistent with the service areas serviced by the petitioning utilities if 
10 the commission approves consolidation into a single consumer-owned water utility.  The 
11 commission may disallow the use of differing rate structures if the commission finds it is 
12 not in the best interest of ratepayers.
133.  Notice to customers; public meeting.   Prior to the filing of a petition pursuant to 
14 subsection 1, the consumer-owned water utilities seeking consolidation must first hold a 
15 public meeting at which any customer may provide comment and may question the officials 
16 present regarding the proposed consolidation.  The consumer-owned water utilities shall, 
17 at least 14 days prior to the public meeting required under this subsection, provide notice 
18 of the proposed consolidation and the meeting in a manner prescribed by the commission, 
19 including the date, time, place and purpose of the meeting to each of its customers. The 
20 notice must include a statement describing the consolidation.  A public meeting held 
21 pursuant to this subsection must include a public comment period prescribed by the 
22 commission.  After the public meeting, the governing bodies of the consumer-owned water 
23 utilities shall hold a meeting to deliberate and vote on the proposed consolidation, which 
24 may be modified on the basis of public comments received during the public meeting. The 
25 consumer-owned water utilities shall take minutes of the public meeting and the subsequent 
26 meeting of the governing bodies.  Upon good cause shown, the commission may waive one 
27 or more of the requirements of this subsection.  
284.  Proceeding; approval.  Upon a petition filed pursuant to subsection 1, the 
29 commission shall provide in a proceeding customers of the petitioning consumer-owned 
30 water utilities and other interested persons the opportunity to comment on or object to the 
31 proposed consolidation.  Upon the conclusion of the proceeding, the commission shall issue 
32 a written decision.  The commission may approve the consolidation petition or 
33 modifications of the petition upon a finding that the consolidation is in the public interest, 
34 subject to any reasonable conditions imposed by the commission.
355.  Rulemaking.  The commission may adopt rules to implement this section. Rules 
36 adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 
37 375, subchapter 2-A.
38§6432. Consolidated consumer-owned water utility charter requirements; 
39commission authority
401. Commission responsibility; charter creation.  If the commission approves a 
41 petition of 2 or more consumer-owned water utilities for consolidation into a single 
42 consumer-owner water utility in accordance with section 6431, by January 15th annually, 
43 the commission shall provide the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
44 jurisdiction over utilities matters with a report on the consolidation of the utilities that 
45 includes a draft charter created in accordance with this section for the newly created 
Page 5 - 131LR0457(01)46 consumer-owned water utility. The committee shall report out a bill for each newly created 
47 water utility provided in the report.
32. Charter requirements.  A consolidated consumer-owned water utility charter 
4 drafted by the commission pursuant to subsection 1 must:
5 A. Meet the requirements for a standard district in accordance with chapter 64; and
6 B. Specify that the consolidated consumer-owned water utility shall acquire all, and 
7 not less than all, of the plants, properties, assets, franchises, rights and privileges owned 
8 by the consumer-owned water utilities being consolidated, including, without 
9 limitation, all lands, buildings, waters, water rights, springs, wells, reservoirs, tanks, 
10 standpipes, mains, pumps, pipes, machinery, fixtures, hydrants, meters, services, tools, 
11 equipment and appliances used or useful in supplying water for domestic, sanitary, 
12 commercial, industrial and municipal purposes. The consideration to be paid for the 
13 plants, properties, assets, franchises, rights and privileges is the assumption by the 
14 consolidated consumer-owned water utility of all of the outstanding debts, obligations 
15 and liabilities of the consumer-owned water utilities being consolidated, including, 
16 without limitation, the assumption by the consolidated consumer-owned water utility 
17 of any outstanding notes or bonds of the consumer-owned water utilities being 
18 consolidated that are due on or after the date of the assumption.
19SUMMARY
20 This bill does the following.
21 1. It increases the gross annual revenues thresholds that trigger audits for qualified 
22 small water utilities.
23 2. It exempts consumer-owned water utilities from specific requirements, including 
24 authorization by the Public Utilities Commission for the issuance of stocks, bonds and 
25 notes.
26 3. It removes the requirement that consumer-owned water utilities publish notices of 
27 public hearings and rate changes in a newspaper and instead provides the commission with 
28 the authority to prescribe the manner in which notice is provided to customers.
29 4. It increases the total annual revenues thresholds that classify what qualifies as a 
30 small, medium and large consumer-owned water utility.
31 5. It creates an expedited rate adjustment mechanism for consumer-owned water 
32 utilities to allow for up to a 1.5% increase in the current total annual revenue as long as 
33 proper notice is provided; however, it does allow the commission to suspend the 
34 adjustment.
35 6. It creates a process for 2 or more consumer-owned water utilities to petition the 
36 commission to consolidate into a single utility and requires the commission to report 
37 annually on consolidation activities to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
38 having jurisdiction over utilities matters and include in that report draft charter language to 
39 be reported out of committee that creates the new consolidated utility.
40 7. It clarifies language.1
