Page 1 - 131LR1752(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3131, sub-§4-B, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. C, §1, is 
3 repealed.
4Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3131, sub-§4-C, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 298, §5, is 
5 amended to read:
64-C.  Nonwires alternative.  "Nonwires alternative" means a nontransmission 
7 alternative or an infrastructure, technology or application that either individually or 
8 collectively defers or reduces the need for capital investment in the transmission and or 
9 distribution system and addresses system reliability needs proposed to be met by the 
10 transmission or distribution system investment.  "Nonwires alternative" includes but is not 
11 limited to energy efficiency and conservation measures, energy storage, load management, 
12 demand response and distributed generation.
13Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3132, sub-§2-D, as amended by PL 2019, c. 298, §7, is 
14 further amended to read:
152-D.  Nontransmission Nonwires alternatives investigation; consideration.  In 
16 considering whether to approve or disapprove all or portions of a proposed transmission 
17 line and associated infrastructure pursuant to subsection 5, the commission shall, for a 
18 transmission line proposed by an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility, 
19 consider the results and recommendations of an investigation by the nonwires alternative 
20 coordinator conducted in accordance with section 3132‑C.
21Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3132, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2019, c. 298, §10, is further 
22 amended to read:
235.  Commission approval of a proposed transmission line; nontransmission 
24nonwires alternatives.  The commission may approve or disapprove all or portions of a 
25 proposed transmission line and shall make such orders regarding its character, size, 
26 installation and maintenance and regarding nontransmission nonwires alternatives to the 
27 proposed transmission line as are necessary, having regard for any increased costs caused 
28 by the orders.  In its review and consideration of nontransmission nonwires alternatives, as 
29 required by subsection 2‑D, the commission shall give preference to the nontransmission 
30 nonwires alternatives that have been identified as able to address the identified need for the 
31 proposed transmission line most cost-effectively.  When the cost-effectiveness of the 
32 identified nontransmission nonwires alternatives are reasonably equal, the commission 
33 shall give preference to the alternatives that produce the lowest amount of local air 
34 emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions.
35Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §3132, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2019, c. 298, §11, is further 
36 amended to read:
376.  Commission order; certificate of public convenience and necessity.  In its order, 
38 the commission shall make specific findings with regard to the public need for the proposed 
39 transmission line.  The commission shall make specific findings with regard to the 
40 likelihood that nontransmission nonwires alternatives can sufficiently address the identified 
41 public need over the effective life of the transmission line more cost-effectively.  If the 
42 commission finds that a public need exists, after considering whether the need can be 
43 reliably and more cost-effectively met using nontransmission nonwires alternatives, it shall 
Page 2 - 131LR1752(01)44 issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the transmission line.  In 
45 determining public need, the commission shall, at a minimum, take into account 
46 economics, reliability, public health and safety, scenic, historic and recreational values, 
47 state renewable energy generation goals, the proximity of the proposed transmission line 
48 to inhabited dwellings and nontransmission nonwires alternatives to construction of the 
49 transmission line, including energy conservation, distributed generation or load 
50 management. If the commission orders or allows the erection of the transmission line, the 
51 order is subject to all other provisions of law and the right of any other agency to approve 
52 the transmission line.  The commission shall, as necessary and in accordance with 
53 subsections 7 and 8, consider the findings of the Department of Environmental Protection 
54 under Title 38, chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 6, with respect to the proposed transmission 
55 line and any modifications ordered by the Department of Environmental Protection to 
56 lessen the impact of the proposed transmission line on the environment. A person may 
57 submit a petition for and obtain approval of a proposed transmission line under this section 
58 before applying for approval under municipal ordinances adopted pursuant to Title 30‑A, 
59 Part 2, Subpart 6‑A; and Title 38, section 438‑A and, except as provided in subsection 4, 
60 before identifying a specific route or route options for the proposed transmission line.  
61 Except as provided in subsection 4, the commission may not consider the petition 
62 insufficient for failure to provide identification of a route or route options for the proposed 
63 transmission line.  The issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity 
64 establishes that, as of the date of issuance of the certificate, the decision by the person to 
65 erect or construct was prudent.  At the time of its issuance of a certificate of public 
66 convenience and necessity, the commission shall send to each municipality through which 
67 a proposed corridor or corridors for a transmission line extends a separate notice that the 
68 issuance of the certificate does not override, supersede or otherwise affect municipal 
69 authority to regulate the siting of the proposed transmission line. The commission may 
70 deny a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a transmission line upon a finding 
71 that the transmission line is reasonably likely to adversely affect any transmission and 
72 distribution utility or its customers.
30Sec. 6.  35-A MRSA §3132, sub-§15, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. C, §7, is 
31 amended to read:
3215.  Advancement of nontransmission nonwires alternatives policies.  The 
33 commission shall advocate in all relevant venues for the pursuit of least-cost solutions to 
34 bulk power system needs on a total cost basis and for all available resources, including 
35 nontransmission nonwires alternatives, to be treated comparably in transmission analysis, 
36 planning and access to funding.
37Sec. 7.  35-A MRSA §3132-A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 298, §12, is further 
38 amended to read:
39§3132-A.  Construction of transmission or subtransmission projects prohibited 
40without approval of the commission
41 A person may not construct any transmission project or subtransmission project 
42 without approval from the commission.  For the purposes of this section, "transmission 
43 project" means any proposed new or upgraded transmission line  and its , substation 
44 component or associated infrastructure that is capable of operating at less than 69 kilovolts  
45 or more.  "Subtransmission project" means any proposed new or upgraded transmission 1

47 than 69 kilovolts and projected to cost in excess of $5,000,000.
31.  Submission requirement.  A person that proposes to undertake in the State a 
4 transmission project or subtransmission project must provide the commission with a 
5 description of the need for the proposed transmission project or subtransmission project.
61-A.  Nonwires alternatives investigation; consideration.  In considering whether to 
7 approve or disapprove all or portions of a proposed transmission project or subtransmission 
8 project pursuant to subsection 2, the commission shall, for a transmission project or 
9 subtransmission project proposed by an investor-owned transmission and distribution 
10 utility, consider the results and recommendations of an investigation by the nonwires 
11 alternative coordinator conducted in accordance with section 3132‑C.
122.  Commission approval of a proposed transmission project or subtransmission 
13project; nontransmission nonwires alternatives.  In order for a transmission project or 
14 subtransmission project to be approved, the commission must consider whether the 
15 identified need over the effective life of the proposed transmission project or 
16 subtransmission project can be reliably and more cost-effectively met using 
17 nontransmission nonwires alternatives. In its review and consideration of nontransmission 
18 nonwires alternatives, as required by subsection 1‑A, the commission shall give preference 
19 to nontransmission nonwires alternatives that have been identified as able to address the 
20 identified need for the proposed transmission project or subtransmission project most cost-
21 effectively. When the cost-effectiveness of the identified nontransmission nonwires 
22 alternatives are reasonably equal, the commission shall give preference to the alternatives 
23 that produce the lowest amount of local air emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions.
243.  Exception.  A transmission project or subtransmission project that is constructed, 
25 owned and operated by a generator of electricity solely for the purpose of electrically and 
26 physically interconnecting the generator to the transmission system of a transmission and 
27 distribution utility is not subject to this section.
28Sec. 8.  35-A MRSA §3132-B, first ¶, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 298, §13, is 
29 amended to read:
30 For the purposes of this section, "small transmission project" means any proposed new 
31 or upgraded transmission line  and , substation component or associated infrastructure 
32 capable of operating at less than 69 kilovolts and projected to cost $5,000,000 or less. For 
33 the purposes of this section, a "distribution project" means any proposed new or upgraded 
34 distribution line, substation component or associated infrastructure capable of operating at 
35 less than 34 kilovolts.
36Sec. 9.  35-A MRSA §3132-B, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 298, §13, is 
37 amended to read:
384.  Nonwires alternatives recommendations.  Based on the investigation under 
39 subsection 2, the nonwires alternative coordinator shall make recommendations to the 
40 investor-owned transmission and distribution utility regarding nonwires alternatives to 
41 proposed small transmission projects and distribution projects.  The nonwires alternative 
42 coordinator and the utility shall attempt to reach a good faith agreement regarding the 
43 adoption of nonwires alternatives that are most cost-effective.  If agreement is reached, the 
44 utility shall pursue the agreed-upon nonwires alternatives. If there is no agreement, the 1
2
Page 4 - 131LR1752(01)45 utility shall or the Office of the Public Advocate may petition the commission to resolve 
46 the dispute.
3Sec. 10.  35-A MRSA §3132-B, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 298, §13, is 
4 amended to read:
55.  Dispute resolution.  In responding to a petition by an investor-owned transmission 
6 and distribution utility or the Office of the Public Advocate pursuant to subsection 4, the 
7 commission shall review the planning study prepared under subsection 1 and the 
8 recommendations of the nonwires alternative coordinator under subsection 4.  In resolving 
9 the dispute, the commission shall give preference to nonwires alternatives that are 
10 identified as able to address the identified need for the proposed small transmission project 
11 or distribution project and are most cost-effective. Of the identified nonwires alternatives, 
12 the commission shall give preference to the lowest-cost nonwires alternatives. When the 
13 costs to ratepayers in this State of the identified nonwires alternatives are reasonably equal, 
14 the commission shall give preference to the nonwires alternatives that produce the lowest 
15 amount of local air emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions.
16Sec. 11.  35-A MRSA §3132-C, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 298, §14, is 
17 amended to read:
181.  Investigation required.  The nonwires alternative coordinator shall conduct an 
19 investigation of and make recommendations regarding nonwires alternatives to a wires 
20 project under section 3132, 3132‑A or 3132‑B in accordance with this section.  The 
21 investigation must be conducted in coordination with the Efficiency Maine Trust.  For the 
22 purposes of this section, "wires project" means a transmission line and associated 
23 infrastructure subject to the requirements of section 3132, a transmission project or 
24 subtransmission project as defined in section 3132‑A or a small transmission project or 
25 distribution project covered by section 3132‑B.

7SUMMARY
8 This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing electric transmission lines 
9 and projects and nonwires alternatives.
10 1.  It repeals the definition of "nontransmission alternative" and incorporates aspects 
11 of the definition of "nontransmission alternative" into the definition of "nonwires 
12 alternative."  It includes energy storage as a nonwires alternative in the definition of 
13 "nonwires alternative."  It changes references to nontransmission alternatives to references 
14 to nonwires alternatives.
15 2.  It provides that a person may not construct any transmission project or 
16 subtransmission project without approval from the Public Utilities Commission.  
17 "Transmission project" is defined as any proposed transmission line, substation component 
18 or associated infrastructure that is capable of operating at 69 kilovolts or more.  
19 "Subtransmission project" is defined as any proposed transmission line, substation 
20 component or associated infrastructure capable of operating at less than 69 kilovolts and 
21 projected to cost in excess of $5,000,000.
22 3.  It allows an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility or the Office of the 
23 Public Advocate to petition the Public Utilities Commission to resolve a dispute between 
24 the nonwires alternative coordinator and the utility regarding nonwires alternatives to 
25 proposed small transmission projects and distribution projects.
26 4.  It provides that an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility may request 
27 a protective order if necessary to protect the confidentiality of customer data or critical 
28 energy infrastructure information provided to the Public Advocate or the Efficiency Maine 
29 Trust to allow the nonwires alternative coordinator to carry out certain investigation and 
30 analysis.
31 5.  It provides that when the Public Utilities Commission determines a nonwires 
32 alternative is appropriate in certain cases involving the review of transmission and 
33 distribution projects, the nonwires alternative must be competitively procured.
34 6.  It removes language that provides that when an investor-owned transmission and 
35 distribution utility voluntarily agrees to a nonwires alternative on the grid side of the meter 
36 regarding certain small transmission and distribution projects, the utility must determine 
37 the entity to deliver the nonwires alternative.8
