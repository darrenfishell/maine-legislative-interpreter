2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §20-A is enacted to read:
3§20-A.  Housing First Program
41. Program established. The Housing First Program, referred to in this section as "the 
5 program," is established in the department to facilitate the delivery of support and 
6 stabilization services to residents of properties established or developed to provide 
7 permanent housing to end chronic homelessness in the State.  Services facilitated under the 
8 program must be available on site, 24 hours a day and be designed to build independent 
9 living skills and connect individuals with community-based services.  The department shall 
10 ensure that reimbursement under the MaineCare program is available to providers under 
11 the program to the maximum extent possible.  For the purposes of this section, "chronic 
12 homelessness" means a situation in which a person is living in a place not meant for human 
13 habitation for at least 12 months, excluding stays in emergency shelters or intermittent brief 
14 stays in a place suitable for human habitation, and for whom homelessness is correlated 
15 with a condition that makes accessing services and maintaining housing a significant 
16 challenge such as substance use disorder or a behavioral health condition.
172. Fund established.  The Housing First Fund, referred to in this section as "the fund," 
18 is established as a separate and distinct fund for accounting and budgetary reporting 
19 purposes in order to support the program.
203. Sources of fund.  The Treasurer of State shall credit to the fund:
21 A. All money received by the State in accordance with Title 36, section 4641-B, 
22 subsection 4-B, paragraph E-1;
23 B. Money from any other source, whether public or private, designated for deposit into 
24 or credited to the fund; and
25 C. Interest earned or other investment income on balances in the fund.
264. Distribution of funds.  The department shall distribute funds to pay those who 
27 provide supportive services to residents at properties established or developed to provide 
28 permanent housing to persons who have been chronically homeless.  The department shall 
29 also use the fund to establish a permanent full-time position in the department to assist 
30 providers with providing 24-hour, on-site supportive services and navigating 
31 reimbursement under the MaineCare program for those services.  Beginning July 1, 2024, 
32 the department shall annually determine the amount necessary to cover any unpaid services 
33 provided under the program in the previous year and the anticipated amount needed to pay 
34 for services expected to be provided at each property in the next fiscal year.  Funds in 
35 excess of those amounts must be transferred to the Maine State Housing Authority for the 
36 purposes of:
37 A. Providing technical assistance to housing developers to help with capital and 
38 planning issues associated with developing properties consistent with the housing 
39 model described by the program; and
40 B. Developing affordable housing, including for projects with a housing model 
41 described by the program to the extent development is not covered by other resources.
Page 2 - 131LR1836(01)15. Report.  Beginning February 1, 2025 and annually thereafter, the department shall 
2 submit a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
3 housing matters describing the number of residents served by the program and the number 
4 of months residents have avoided returning to homelessness or maintained stable housing.
