251.  Notice of intent to award.  After an evaluation of bids received, the bureau shall 
26 issue a notice that it intends to award the contract to the best-value bidder in accordance 
27 with section 1825-B.  The notice must be issued as soon as practicable after bids are 
28 submitted. The notice must stipulate that the contract award is conditioned on the issuance 
29 of a written determination of contractor responsibility as required by subsection 5 and any 
30 other conditions determined appropriate by the bureau.
312.  Subcontractor list and certifications.  Within 7 days from the date of notice of

Page 4 - 131LR2361(01)45 meet applicable requirements of this subchapter or on any other relevant grounds by 
46 submitting a letter with supporting evidence to the bureau.
34.  Bureau review of contractor and subcontractor.  After issuing a notice of intent 
4 to award the contract under subsection 1, the bureau shall conduct a review over a period 
5 of 30 days to verify whether the prospective awardee, including the prime contractor and 
6 any subcontractors, meets the applicable requirements of this subchapter, meets the 
7 requirements of any other applicable laws, rules, regulations and ordinances and possesses 
8 the resources, qualifications and capabilities to successfully perform the contract.  As part 
9 of this review, the bureau shall verify that the contractor responsibility certification form 
10 under section 1826-Q has been submitted and properly executed for all contractors.  The 
11 bureau may conduct any additional inquiries necessary to verify that the prospective 
12 awardee and its subcontractors have a sufficient record of compliance with the law and 
13 business integrity to justify the award of the contract.  In conducting the inquiries, the 
14 bureau may seek relevant information from the contractor, its prior clients or customers, its 
15 subcontractors or any other relevant source.
16 If, in the course of its review, the bureau determines that a subcontractor listed pursuant to 
17 subsection 2 does not meet the requirements of this subchapter, the bureau may permit the 
18 prospective awardee to substitute a qualified subcontractor that meets the requirements of 
19 this subchapter; require the prospective awardee to perform the work in question if the 
20 prospective awardee has the required experience, licenses and other qualifications to 
21 perform such work; or disqualify the prospective awardee. If the bureau determines that a 
22 subcontractor does not meet the requirements of this subchapter, the prospective awardee 
23 may not make any contractual claim against the bureau on the basis of a subcontractor 
24 disqualification.
255.  Written determination.  If, at the conclusion of the review required by subsection 
26 4, the bureau determines that all contractor responsibility certification forms under section 
27 1826-Q have been properly completed and executed and the qualifications, background and 
28 responsibility of the prospective awardee and its subcontractors are satisfactory, the bureau 
29 shall issue a written determination verifying that the prospective awardee is a qualified 
30 responsible contractor.  If the bureau determines that the prospective awardee does not meet 
31 the requirements of this subchapter, the bureau shall advise the prospective awardee of its 
32 determination in writing and proceed to consider the 2nd best-value bidder or, if necessary, 
33 rebid the project.  The determination of contractor responsibility must be issued no later 
34 than 30 days after the date of the notice of intent to award the contract under subsection 1.  
35 The bureau may revoke or revise the determination of contractor responsibility at any time 
36 if the bureau obtains relevant information warranting any such revocation or revision.
37ยง1826-S.  False or misleading information
38 If at any time the bureau determines that a contractor responsibility certification form 
39 submitted pursuant to section 1826-Q contains false or misleading material information 
40 provided by a contractor knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth or evidences an 
41 omission of material information knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth by the 
42 contractor, the bureau shall prohibit the contractor for which the certification form was 
43 submitted from being awarded any contract covered by this subchapter for a period of 3 
44 years and apply any other penalties and sanctions, including contract termination, available 
45 to the State. For a contract terminated under this section, the State may withhold payment
