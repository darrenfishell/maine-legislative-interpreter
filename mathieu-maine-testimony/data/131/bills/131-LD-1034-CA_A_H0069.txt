19 including that service of every temporary, emergency or interim order issued under this 
20 chapter must be attempted within 48 hours after receiving notice of that order from the 
21 court. Service of a protection from abuse order that is not in compliance with a policy 
22 adopted under this subsection does not affect the validity of the service or the order.' 
23 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
24 number to read consecutively. 
25 SUMMARY 
26 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment requires every law enforcement 
27 agency to adopt a written policy requiring that service of every temporary, emergency or 
28 interim protection from abuse order be attempted within 48 hours after the agency receives 
29 notice of that order from the court. Unlike the bill, it also clarifies that failure of the law 
30 enforcement agency to attempt service within 48 hours does not affect the validity of the 
31 service or the order.
