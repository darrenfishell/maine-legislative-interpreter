12 sharing consumer health data concerning the consumer and to access the data, 
13 including a list of all 3rd parties and affiliates with whom or to whom the regulated

15 online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact these 3rd parties. 
16 B. A consumer has the right to confirm that a regulated entity has not sold consumer 
17 health data concerning the consumer.

20 D. A consumer has the right to have consumer health data concerning the consumer 
21 deleted and may exercise that right by informing the regulated entity of the consumer's 
22 request for deletion.
232. Request to delete consumer health data. A regulated entity that receives a 
24 consumer's request to delete any consumer health data concerning the consumer shall 
25 without unreasonable delay and no more than 30 calendar days from receiving the deletion 
26 request:
27 A. Delete the consumer health data from its records, including from all parts of the 
28 regulated entity's network or backup systems; and
29 B. Notify all affiliates, service providers, contractors and other 3rd parties with which 
30 the regulated entity has shared consumer health data of the deletion request.
31 All affiliates, service providers, contractors and 3rd parties that receive notice of a 
32 consumer's deletion request shall honor the consumer's deletion request and delete the 
33 consumer health data from any possessed records, including from all parts of a network or 
34 backup system.
353. Exercise of rights. A consumer may exercise the rights set forth in this chapter by 
36 submitting a request, at any time, to a regulated entity.  A request may be made by a secure 
37 and reliable method established by the regulated entity and described in its consumer health 
38 data privacy policy.  The method must take into account the ways in which consumers 
39 normally interact with the regulated entity, the need for secure and reliable communication 
40 of such requests and the ability of the regulated entity to authenticate the identity of the 
41 consumer making the request.  A regulated entity may not require a consumer to create a 
Page 9 - 131LR2108(01)42 new account in order to exercise consumer rights pursuant to this chapter but may require 
43 a consumer to use an existing account.

7 the purposes that are strictly necessary to provide a product or service that the consumer to 
8 whom the data relates has requested from the regulated entity and for which the consumer 
9 provided consent.
102. Data security practices. A regulated entity shall establish, implement and maintain 
11 administrative, technical and physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy a 
12 reasonable standard of care within the regulated entity's industry to protect the 
13 confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of consumer health data appropriate to the 
14 volume and nature of the personal information at issue. 
153.  Disposing of consumer health data; retention schedule.  A regulated entity shall 
16 dispose of consumer health data in accordance with a retention schedule that requires the 
17 deletion of consumer health data when the data is required to be deleted by law or is no 
18 longer necessary for the purpose for which the data was collected, processed or transferred, 
19 unless an individual has provided consent to such retention.  The disposal of consumer 
20 health data must include destroying, permanently erasing or otherwise modifying the 
21 consumer health data to make the data permanently unreadable or indecipherable and 
22 unrecoverable to ensure ongoing compliance with this section.  A service provider shall 
23 establish practices to delete or return consumer health data to a regulated entity as requested 
24 at the end of the provision of services unless retention of the consumer health data is 
25 required by law.
26ยง1350-T. Requirements for service providers 
271. Processing. A service provider may process consumer health data only pursuant to 
28 a binding contract between the service provider and the regulated entity that sets forth the 
29 processing instructions and limits the actions the service provider may take with respect to 
30 the consumer health data it processes on behalf of the regulated entity. A service provider 
31 may process consumer health data only in a manner that is consistent with the instructions 
32 set forth in the binding contract with the regulated entity.
332. Assistance. A service provider shall assist the regulated entity by providing 
34 appropriate technical and organizational support in fulfilling the regulated entity's 
35 obligations under this chapter.
363. Failure to adhere to instructions. If a service provider fails to adhere to the 
37 regulated entity's instructions or processes consumer health data in a manner that is outside 
38 the scope of the service provider's contract with the regulated entity, the service provider 
39 is deemed a regulated entity under this chapter and is subject to all the requirements of this 
40 chapter. 
41ยง1350-U. Sale of consumer health data 
42 It is unlawful for any person, including, but not limited to, regulated entities or service 
43 providers, to sell consumer health data. 1

Page 10 - 131LR2108(01)1ยง1350-V. Geofence
