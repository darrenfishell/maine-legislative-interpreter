6 municipality for qualifying expenses incurred as a result of the municipality's  
7 municipalities opting to permit the operation of some or all adult use cannabis 
8 establishments within the municipality.   For the purposes of this paragraph, "qualifying 
9 expenses" means legal fees and costs associated with the drafting and adoption of a 
10 warrant article or the adoption or amendment of an ordinance, including the conduct 
11 of a town meeting or election, by a municipality that opted to permit the operation of 
12 some or all cannabis establishments within the municipality.  Each municipality may 
13 receive funds, not to exceed $20,000, only once for the reimbursement of qualifying 
14 expenses in accordance with this paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph may be 
15 construed to require the department to reimburse qualifying expenses incurred by a 
16 municipality if the department determines there are insufficient funds available to 
17 provide reimbursement.  Under no circumstances may a municipality submit an initial 
18 application for the reimbursement of qualifying expenses more than 3 years after the 
19 municipality adopts a warrant article or adopts or amends an ordinance to allow for the 
20 operation of some or all adult use cannabis establishments within the municipality.  The 
21 department may adopt rules to implement and administer the reimbursement of 
22 qualifying expenses to municipalities. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph are 
23 routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.  The 
24 department may not reimburse qualifying expenses under this paragraph accrued after 
25 July 1, 2027.  The department shall distribute the reimbursement equally to all 
26 municipalities that qualify for the reimbursement.
