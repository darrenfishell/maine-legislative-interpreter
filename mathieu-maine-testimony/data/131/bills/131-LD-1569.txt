3 D-4.  For property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2024, the estates as

5 exemption under paragraph C or C-1 because of age or service requirements or an 
6 eligible survivor of such a disabled veteran.
7 (1) For the purposes of this paragraph, "disabled veteran" means a permanent

9 the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as 30% or greater. For purposes 
10 of this paragraph, "eligible survivor" means an unremarried widow or widower or 
11 minor child or parent of a deceased disabled veteran.
12 (2) An exemption calculated under this paragraph may be applied only to a 
13 homestead, as defined in section 681, subsection 2, of the person claiming the 
14 exemption.

16 survivor, including property held in a revocable living trust for the benefit of that 
17 eligible survivor.
18 (4) An eligible individual may elect to receive an exemption under another 
19 paragraph of this subsection instead of the exemption under this paragraph.

21 as follows:
22 (a) For a veteran with a service-connected disability rated by the United States 
23 Department of Veterans Affairs as at least 30%, but less than 40%, the 
24 exemption is $3,000;
25 (b) For a veteran with a service-connected disability rated by the United States 
26 Department of Veterans Affairs as at least 40%, but less than 50%, the 
27 exemption is $4,000;
28 (c) For a veteran with a service-connected disability rated by the United States 
29 Department of Veterans Affairs as at least 50%, but less than 60%, the 
30 exemption is $5,000;
31 (d) For a veteran with a service-connected disability rated by the United States

3 (6) Notwithstanding paragraph H, a municipality granting exemptions under this 
4 paragraph is entitled to reimbursement from the State of 100% of the property tax 
5 revenue lost as a result of the exemptions in the manner provided under section 
6 661.
7SUMMARY
8 This bill provides a property tax exemption for the estates of certain veterans for 
9 property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2024. Like current exemptions for the 
10 estates of veterans, the exemption is also made available to an eligible survivor, who may 
11 be a widow or widower, a minor child or a parent of an eligible disabled veteran, following 
12 the death of the eligible disabled veteran. The calculation of the exemption is changed to 
13 provide a flat exemption amount that increases from $3,000 to $10,000 based on the 
14 percentage of the veteran's service-connected disability. The bill also requires state 
15 reimbursement to municipalities and the Unorganized Territory Education and Services 
16 Fund for 100% of the property tax revenue lost as a result of the exemptions.8
