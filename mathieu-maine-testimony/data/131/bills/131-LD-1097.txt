2Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §2105, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 1987, c. 737, Pt. A, §2 and 
3 Pt. C, §106 and amended by PL 1989, c. 6; c. 9, §2; and c. 104, Pt. C, §§8 and 10, is further 
4 amended to read:
54.  Effective date.  If a majority  more of the ballots votes cast on any question under 
6 subsection 1 or 2 favor acceptance than oppose it, the new charter, charter revision, charter 
7 modification or charter amendment proposed in that question becomes effective as

14 (1)  New charters, charter revisions or charter modifications take effect

16 provisions.
17 B.  Charter amendments adopted by the voters take effect on the date determined by 
18 the municipal officers, but not later than the first day of the next municipal year.
19SUMMARY
20 This bill changes the requirements for a new municipal charter, charter revision, charter 
21 modification or charter amendment in a question before the voters to go into effect.  Current 
22 law requires that the total number of votes cast for and against the question equals or 
23 exceeds 30% of the total votes cast in the municipality in the last gubernatorial election.  
24 The bill requires instead that the number of votes cast in favor of the question equals or 
25 exceeds 15% of the total votes cast in the municipality in the last gubernatorial election and 
26 clarifies that this means votes cast for Governor in that election.  Also, while this bill does 
27 not change the requirement that a majority of votes cast for and against the proposed change 
28 be in favor of it in order for that change to go into effect, it clarifies that blank votes are not 
29 counted in that calculation.20
