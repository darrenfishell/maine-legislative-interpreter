4 The trust shall establish a home energy scoring system in accordance with this section 
5 for residential buildings for the purpose of evaluating a building's energy efficiency and 
6 relative greenhouse gas emissions.  This section governs the development of the home 
7 energy score and home energy audit requirements.
81.  Home energy audit requirements.  A home energy audit must be conducted by an 
9 energy auditor that meets the requirements of section 10114.  An energy auditor must 
10 provide a written report of the home energy audit to the requestor of the home energy audit.  
11 The report must include the building's home energy score.
122.  Violations.  Penalties may be issued by the trust against an individual who:
13 A. Conducts or offers to conduct a home energy audit without meeting the requirements 
14 of section 10114; or
15 B. Impersonates an energy auditor.
163. Uses of home energy score. A home energy score provided under subsection 1 may 
17 be used in accordance with the following:

22 financial rebates or other incentives for energy efficiency improvements under 
23 programs administered by the trust.
244.  Rules.  The trust shall adopt rules to implement this section, including but not 
25 limited to:
26 A. Rules establishing a home energy scoring system required under this section in 
27 accordance with this paragraph.  The home energy score must be consistent with the 
28 United States Department of Energy asset-based home energy score in order to measure 
29 the performance of the building and not the number or behavior of occupants of the 
30 building;
31 B. Rules relating to the report required under subsection 1, including:
32 (1) The time period an energy auditor has to provide a report of a home energy 
33 audit to the requestor of the audit; and
34 (2) Information required to be contained in the report of a home energy audit, 
35 including the following depicted through graphics:
36 (a) Home energy score on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the best score;
37 (b) Amount of estimated energy use by fuel type per year;
38 (c) Unit prices by fuel type used to calculate the estimated energy costs;
39 (d) Estimated annual cost of energy by fuel type;
Page 2 - 131LR0271(01)1 (e) Estimate of current greenhouse gas emissions in carbon dioxide equivalent 
2 tons per year on a scale of zero to 15;
3 (f) Itemized recommendations for energy saving improvement in order of 
4 priority, for which a priority energy saving improvement has an expected full 
5 economic recoupment in no more than 10 years;
6 (g) Recommendations for energy saving improvement, such as improving 
7 insulation to windows, walls, roofs, attics and floors;
8 (h) Estimated home energy score, estimated energy savings in dollars per year 
9 and estimated carbon reduction in percent per year after priority energy saving 
10 improvement are implemented;
11 (i) Amount of renewable energy generated by the residential building;
12 (j) Name and contact information of the energy auditor, the energy auditor's 
13 employer and the energy auditor's certificate number;
14 (k) Date of the home energy audit and date of the expiration of the home energy 
15 score;
16 (l) Address of the residential building audited, the floor area in square feet and 
17 the year the building was constructed;
18 (m) A statement indicating that the report meets state standards for home 
19 energy audits;
20 (n) A list of other energy efficiency-related certifications for which the 
21 residential building is qualified; and
22 (o) A list of applicable rebates or other incentives to achieve greater energy 
23 efficiency;
24 C. Rules establishing penalties for violations described in subsection 2; and
25 D. Requirements for an energy auditor to report to the trust home energy scores and
