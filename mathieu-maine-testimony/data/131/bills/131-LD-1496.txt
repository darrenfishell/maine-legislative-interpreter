142.  Public policy; enforceability of noncompete agreements.  Noncompete 
15 agreements are contrary to public policy and are enforceable only in situations described 
16 in subsection 3-B and only to the extent that they are reasonable and are no broader than

18 employer: .

20 B.  The employer's confidential information that does not qualify as a trade secret; or
21 C.  The employer's goodwill.
22 A noncompete agreement may be presumed necessary if the legitimate business interest 
23 cannot be adequately protected through an alternative restrictive covenant, including but 
24 not limited to a nonsolicitation agreement or a nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement.
253.  Prohibited for certain workers.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, an employer may 
26 not require or permit an employee earning wages at or below 400% of the federal poverty

34 as the business that was sold;
35 B.  A shareholder in a limited liability company organized under the laws of this State

2 employer and a resident of this State is unenforceable.  If the noncompete agreement made 
3 between an out-of-state employer and a resident of this State includes a choice of law 
4 provision, this State may not enforce that provision if it violates the State's public policy 
5 described under subsection 2.
64.  Disclosure; notice.  An employer shall disclose prior to an offer of employment 
7 with the employer that will require the acceptance of a noncompete agreement a statement 
8 that a noncompete agreement will be required.
9 An employer shall notify an employee or prospective employee of a noncompete agreement 
10 requirement and provide a copy of the noncompete agreement not less than 3 business days 
11 before the employer requires the agreement to be signed to allow time for the employee or 
12 prospective employee to review the agreement and negotiate the terms of the agreement or 
13 employment with the employer if the employee or prospective employee wishes to do so.
144-A.  Posted notice required.  The Department of Labor shall create a poster 
15 containing the laws governing noncompete agreements under this section that employers 
16 shall post in a central workplace location.  The poster must be printed in a minimum font 
17 size, as determined by the Department of Labor, in accordance with provisions of law 
18 governing disability-related accommodations.
195.  Effective date of a noncompete agreement.  Except for a noncompete agreement 
20 between an employer and an allopathic physician or an osteopathic physician licensed 
21 under Title 32, chapter 48 or chapter 36, respectively, the terms of a noncompete agreement 
22 do not take effect until after one year of the employee's employment with the employer or 
23 a period of 6 months from the date the agreement was signed, whichever is later.
246.  Penalty; enforcement.  An employer that violates subsection 3 or 4 3-A commits 
25 a civil violation for which a fine of not less than $5,000 may be adjudged.  The Department 
26 of Labor is responsible for enforcement of this section.
277.  Application.  This section applies to all noncompete agreements entered into or 
28 renewed after the effective date of this section.
