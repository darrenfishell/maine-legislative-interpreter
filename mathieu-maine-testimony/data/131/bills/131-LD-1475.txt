2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง5219-AAA is enacted to read:
3ยง5219-AAA.  Credit for biotechnology incubators and biomanufacturing facilities
41.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings:
6 A.  "Affiliated group" has the same meaning as in section 5102, subsection 1-B.
7 B.  "Biomanufacturing" means a facility of at least 5,000 square feet that engages in 
8 advanced manufacturing of biotechnology products.
9 C.  "Biotechnology incubator" means a facility of at least 5,000 square feet that offers 
10 laboratory space, management and meeting space and other resources to start-up, early-
11 stage or established biotechnology companies seeking to develop new biotechnology 
12 products.
13 D.  "Biotechnology products" means commercially important biomaterials and 
14 biomolecules for use in advanced research, medicines, food and beverage processing 
15 or industrial applications that are manufactured using biological processes.
16 E.  "Certified applicant" means a qualified applicant that has received a certificate of 
17 approval from the commissioner pursuant to this section.
18 F.  "Commissioner" means the Commissioner of Economic and Community 
19 Development.
20 G.  "Facility" means one or more buildings and includes the real and personal property 
21 located in those buildings.
22 H.  "Qualified applicant" means an applicant that, at the time an application for a 
23 certificate of approval is submitted, intends to make a qualified investment within 2 
24 years following the date of the application.
25 I.  "Qualified investment" means an investment of at least $5,000,000 and not more 
26 than $15,000,000 to design, permit, construct, modify, equip or expand a 
27 biotechnology incubator or a biomanufacturing facility that will be located in this State.  
282.  Procedures for application; certificate of approval.  This subsection governs the 
29 procedures for providing for and obtaining a certificate of approval.
30 A.  An applicant may apply to the commissioner for a certificate of approval.  An 
31 applicant shall submit to the commissioner information demonstrating that the 
32 applicant is qualified.  If a certified applicant intends to make an additional qualified 
33 investment, the certified applicant may apply to the commissioner for an additional 
34 certificate of approval.
35 B.  The commissioner, within 30 days of receipt of an application submitted pursuant 
36 to paragraph A, shall determine whether the applicant is qualified and shall issue either 
37 a certificate of approval or a written denial indicating why the applicant is not qualified.  
38 The certificate of approval issued by the commissioner must describe the qualified 
39 investment and specify the total amount of qualified investment approved under the 
40 certificate.  A qualified applicant may invest more than $15,000,000 in such projects, 
41 but only $15,000,000 of the investment may be considered a qualified investment for 
Page 2 - 131LR1929(01)42 purposes of this section.  The investments and activities of a qualified applicant and 
43 other entities that are members of the qualified applicant's affiliated group must be 
44 aggregated to determine whether a qualified investment has been made.  A qualified 
45 investment includes capital from all sources, including loans, grants, gifts and other 
46 financing sources.
6 C.  Upon completing a qualified investment, a certified applicant shall submit an 
7 application to the commissioner for a certificate of completion.  If the commissioner 
8 determines that a qualified investment has been made, the commissioner shall issue a 
9 certificate of completion to the certified applicant within 30 days.  The certificate of 
10 completion must state the amount of qualified investment made by the certified 
11 applicant.
12 D.  Upon issuance of a certificate of completion in accordance with paragraph C, the 
13 commissioner shall issue, on behalf of the State, a memorandum to the qualified 
14 applicant describing the benefits provided by this section at the time the certificate of 
15 completion is issued. The memorandum must provide that the certificate of completion 
16 does not prohibit the commissioner from revoking a certificate in accordance with 
17 paragraph F and does not prohibit the assessor from assessing and collecting an 
18 overpaid benefit in accordance with the provisions of this Title.
19 E.  A certified applicant shall obtain approval from the commissioner to transfer a 
20 certificate of approval or a certificate of completion to another person. A certificate of 
21 approval or certificate of completion may be transferred only if all or substantially all 
22 of the assets of the certified applicant are, or will be, transferred to that person or if 
23 50% or more of the certified applicant's voting stock is, or will be, acquired by that 
24 person. The commissioner shall approve the transfer of the certificate of approval or 
25 the certificate of completion only if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:  
26 (1) The person receiving the certificate of approval or certificate of completion is 
27 a member of the certified applicant's affiliated group at the time of the transfer; or
28 (2) The commissioner finds that the person receiving the certificate of approval or 
29 certificate of completion will, and has the capacity to, maintain operations of the 
30 biotechnology incubator or biomanufacturing facility in the State in a manner that 
31 meets the minimum qualifications for continued eligibility of benefits under this 
32 section after the transfer occurs.
33 If the commissioner approves a transfer of a certificate of approval or certificate of 
34 completion, the person receiving the certificate of approval or certificate of completion, 
35 from the date of the transfer, must be treated as the certified applicant and is eligible to 
36 claim any remaining benefit under the certificate of approval or the certificate of 
37 completion that has not been previously claimed by the certified applicant as long as 
38 the person receiving the certificate of approval or certificate of completion meets the 
39 same eligibility requirements and conditions for the credit as applied to the original 
40 certified applicant. 
41 F.  The commissioner shall revoke a certificate of approval if the certified applicant or 
42 a person that received a certificate of approval pursuant to paragraph D fails to make a 
43 qualified investment within 2 years of the date of the certificate of approval. The 
44 commissioner shall revoke a certificate of approval or a certificate of completion if the 
45 certified applicant or person receiving the certificate of approval or certificate of 1

Page 3 - 131LR1929(01)46 completion ceases operations of the biotechnology incubator or biomanufacturing 
47 facility in the State for more than 183 days or the certificate of approval or certificate 
48 of completion is transferred to another person without approval from the commissioner 
49 pursuant to paragraph E. A certified applicant whose certificate of completion is 
50 revoked within 3 years after the date it was issued shall return to the State an amount 
51 equal to the total credits claimed for all tax years under this section. A certified 
52 applicant whose certificate of completion is revoked during the period from 4 years to 
53 the end of 5 years after the date the certificate was issued shall return to the State an 
54 amount equal to the total credits claimed under this section for the period from 4 years 
55 to the end of 5 years after the date the certificate was issued. If credit amounts are 
56 recaptured after a certificate of approval has been transferred as provided in paragraph 
57 E, the person receiving the certificate of approval or certificate of completion is 
58 responsible for payment of any credit amounts that must be returned to the State. The 
59 amount to be returned to the State under this paragraph is, for purposes of this Title, a 
60 tax subject to the collection and enforcement provisions contained in Part 1, including 
61 the application of applicable interest and penalties. The amount to be returned to the 
62 State must be added to the tax imposed on the taxpayer under this Part for the taxable 
63 year during which the certificate is revoked.
19 The commissioner may not issue certificates of approval under this subsection that total, in 
20 the aggregate, more than $30,000,000 of qualified investment for biotechnology incubators 
21 and more than $30,000,000 of qualified investment for biomanufacturing facilities, for a 
22 maximum of $60,000,000 of qualified investment for all certificates of approval.
233.  Refundable credit allowed.  A certified applicant that has received a certificate of 
24 completion is allowed a refundable tax credit as provided in this subsection.
25 A.  Subject to the limitations in paragraph D, beginning with the tax year during which 
26 the certificate of completion is issued or the tax year beginning in 2025, whichever is 
27 later, and for each of the following 4 tax years, a certified applicant that has made a 
28 qualified investment in a biotechnology incubator is allowed a credit against the tax 
29 due under this Part for the taxable year in an amount equal to 6% of the qualified 
30 investment, up to a total credit of $900,000 in any tax year.  The credit allowed under 
31 this paragraph is refundable to the extent that the certified applicant does not have tax 
32 liability in this State for the taxable year, or is not subject to income tax in this State.
33 B.  Subject to the limitations in paragraph D, beginning with the tax year during which 
34 the certificate of completion is issued or the tax year beginning in 2025, whichever is 
35 later, and for each of the following 4 tax years, a certified applicant that has made a 
36 qualified investment in a biomanufacturing facility is allowed a credit against the tax 
37 due under this Part for the taxable year in an amount equal to 6% of the qualified 
38 investment, up to a total credit of $900,000 in any tax year.  The credit allowed under 
39 this paragraph is refundable to the extent that the certified applicant does not have tax 
40 liability in this State for the taxable year, or is not subject to income tax in this State.
41 C.  An individual or owner of a pass-through entity that has received a certificate of 
42 completion is allowed a refundable credit under this subsection based on the 
43 individual's or owner's percentage interest in the profits and losses of the pass-through 
44 entity.  For purposes of this paragraph, "pass-through entity" means a corporation that
