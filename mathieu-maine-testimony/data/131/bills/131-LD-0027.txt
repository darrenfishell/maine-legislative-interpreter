Page 1 - 131LR0095(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §1291, sub-§26-A, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 628, Pt. B, §3, is 
3 amended to read:
426-A.  Residential dwelling.  "Residential dwelling" means a room or group of rooms 
5 that form a single independent habitable unit for permanent occupation by one or more 
6 individuals that has facilities with permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, 
7 cooking and sanitation, including common areas and appurtenant structures.  "Residential 
8 dwelling" does not include:
9 A.  An area not used for living, sleeping, eating, cooking or sanitation, such as an 
10 unfinished basement, that is not readily accessible to children under 6 years of age;
11 B.  A zero-bedroom dwelling unit  where the living area is not separated from the 
12 sleeping area, such as a dwelling unit within a hotel, motel or seasonal or temporary 
13 lodging facility unless the unit is occupied by one or more children under 6 years of 
14 age for a period exceeding 30 days . This exemption does not apply if a child under 6 
15 years of age resides or is expected to reside in the dwelling unit or visit the dwelling 
16 unit on a regular basis;
17 C.  An area that is secured and inaccessible to occupants;
18 D.  Housing for the elderly, or a dwelling unit designated exclusively for adults with 
19 disabilities.  This exemption does not apply if a child under 6 years of age resides or is 
20 expected to reside in the dwelling unit or visit the dwelling unit on a regular basis; or
21 E.  An unoccupied dwelling unit that is to be demolished because it is considered unsafe 
22 and is thus no longer habitable for occupation, as long as the dwelling unit remains 
23 unoccupied and posted as a lead hazard until demolition.
24Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §1292, sub-§5, as amended by PL 1997, c. 624, §14 and PL 
25 2003, c. 689, Pt. B, §6, is further amended to read:
265.  Exemption.  A person who is 18 years of age or older need not obtain licensing and 
27 certification to perform lead abatement activities within a residential dwelling unit that the 
28 person owns and personally occupies, as long as a child residing in the dwelling unit has 
29 not been identified as lead-poisoned.  A person 18 years of age or older who owns and 
30 personally occupies a dwelling unit in which a resident child has been identified as lead-
31 poisoned need not obtain licensing and certification to perform abatement activities within 
32 that dwelling unit, as long as the person completes any training required by the Department 
33 of Health and Human Services.
34SUMMARY
35 This bill changes the definition of "residential dwelling" in the laws governing lead 
36 abatement.  It also removes the exemption that provides that a person 18 years of age or 
37 older who owns and personally occupies a dwelling unit in which a resident child has been 
38 identified as lead-poisoned need not obtain licensing and certification to perform abatement 
39 activities within that dwelling unit, as long as the person completes any training required 
40 by the Department of Health and Human Services.35
