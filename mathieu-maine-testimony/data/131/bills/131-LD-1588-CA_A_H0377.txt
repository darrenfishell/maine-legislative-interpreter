I 
1 that a bargammg agent of a pubhc sector umon may request personal contact mformat1on 
2 for all other employees not more often than quarterly 
3 The fiscal note identifies a potential unfunded state mandate m the reqmred supplying 
4 of personal contact information by a pubhc employer to a bargammg agent, which 1s subject 
5 to a dispute resolution process of an applicable collective bargammg agreement foi a pubhc 
6 employee 
7 The cmmmttee reviewed the fiscal note and determined that because a new dispute 
8 resolution process is not bemg created and that because the dispute resolution ptocess is 
9 only triggered 1f there is not compliance by the pubhc employer, the requirement m the 
10 amendment that this is subject to the dispute resolution process and may therefore result m 
11 increased cost to the pubhc employees for legal and other services does not reqmre an 
12 expansion or modificat10n of activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures
