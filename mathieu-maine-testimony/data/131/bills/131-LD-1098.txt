29SUMMARY
30 Public Law 2019, chapter 154 removed the exemption from immunization 
31 requirements based on religious or philosophical beliefs for students in elementary, 
32 secondary and postsecondary schools and employees of nursery schools and certain health 
33 care facilities.  This bill reinstates the religious and philosophical exemptions.
34 Current law provides that a student enrolled in a distance education program is exempt 
35 from the school immunization requirements.  This bill expands that exemption to private 
36 schools and virtual public charter schools.30
