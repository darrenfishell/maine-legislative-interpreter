2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง3197 is enacted to read:
3ยง3197.  Disability determination for children
4 A child with a disability who has been determined eligible as a Medicaid recipient or 
5 a child who is determined eligible for MaineCare under the Katie Beckett option authorized 
6 by the federal Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 does not require any 
7 additional disability determinations by the department.  A parent or guardian of a child may 
8 request a new disability determination from the department under this section if the parent 
9 or guardian believes there has been a change in the child's medical situation.  The 
10 department shall make the new determination within 45 days of the request.  This section 
11 does not affect any required redeterminations for eligibility for MaineCare that are based 
12 on income.  The department may adopt or amend its rules to implement this section.  Rules 
13 adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 
14 375, subchapter 2-A.
15Sec. 2.  Rulemaking.  The Department of Health and Human Services shall amend 
16 its rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter X, Section 3 to remove 
17 requirements for annual medical eligibility and establish a process for a request for a new 
18 medical determination if requested by a parent or guardian.  The department shall amend 
19 its rule Chapter 332 to remove any requirements for annual medical eligibility for 
20 MaineCare or the Children's Health Insurance Program for children with a disability and 
21 establish a process for a request for a new medical determination if requested by a parent 
22 or guardian.  Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined 
23 in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
24Sec. 3.  State plan amendment.  The Department of Health and Human Services 
25 shall prepare and submit any necessary Medicaid state plan amendments to the United 
26 States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
27 Services for approval for the removal of annual disability determinations for children with 
28 disabilities required by this Act.
29SUMMARY
30 This bill removes the requirement for a child with a disability who had been determined 
31 eligible for MaineCare or under the Katie Beckett option to undergo any additional medical 
32 or disability determinations unless a parent or guardian requests a new determination based 
33 on a belief that there has been a change in the child's medical situation.  It requires the 
34 Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules to reflect that change.  It also 
35 requires the department to submit any necessary state plan amendments necessary to 
36 implement the statutory and rule changes.30
