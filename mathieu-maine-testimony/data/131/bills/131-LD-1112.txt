Page 1 - 131LR1536(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §102, sub-§13-A, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 643, §8 and 
3 affected by §14, is amended to read:
413-A.  Independent contractor.  A person who performs services for remuneration is 
5 presumed to be an employee unless the employing unit proves that the person is free from 
6 the essential direction and control of the employing unit, both under the person's contract 
7 of service and in fact and the person meets specific criteria.  A temporary employment 
8 agency employee is an employee of the temporary employment agency and is not an 
9 independent contractor.  In order for a person other than a temporary employment agency 
10 employee to be an independent contractor:
11 A.  The following criteria must be met:
12 (1)  The person has the essential right to control the means and progress of the 
13 work except as to final results;
14 (2)  The person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, 
15 occupation, profession or business;
16 (3)  The person has the opportunity for profit and loss as a result of the services 
17 being performed for the other individual or entity;
18 (4)  The person hires and pays the person's assistants, if any, and, to the extent such 
19 assistants are employees, supervises the details of the assistants' work; and
20 (5)  The person makes the person's services available to some client or customer 
21 community even if the person's right to do so is voluntarily not exercised or is 
22 temporarily restricted; and
23 B.  At least 3 of the following criteria must be met:
24 (1)  The person has a substantive investment in the facilities, tools, instruments, 
25 materials and knowledge used by the person to complete the work;
26 (2)  The person is not required to work exclusively for the other individual or entity;
27 (3)  The person is responsible for satisfactory completion of the work and may be 
28 held contractually responsible for failure to complete the work;
29 (4)  The parties have a contract that defines the relationship and gives contractual 
30 rights in the event the contract is terminated by the other individual or entity prior 
31 to completion of the work;
32 (5)  Payment to the person is based on factors directly related to the work 
33 performed and not solely on the amount of time expended by the person;
34 (6)  The work is outside the usual course of business for which the service is 
35 performed; or
36 (7)  The person has been determined to be an independent contractor by the federal 
37 Internal Revenue Service.
38Sec. 2.  39-A MRSA §102, sub-§18-A is enacted to read:

40 entity that contracts with an employer to provide on a project or temporary basis a person 
Page 2 - 131LR1536(01)41 to perform services for the employer normally provided by an employee of the employer

3Sec. 3.  39-A MRSA §102, sub-§18-B is enacted to read:
418-B.  Temporary employment agency employee.  "Temporary employment agency 
5 employee" means a person who provides services on a project or temporary basis for an 
6 employer pursuant to a contract with a temporary employment agency under which the 
7 person is remunerated by the temporary employment agency for the services performed.

12 employment agency and not an independent contractor.1
