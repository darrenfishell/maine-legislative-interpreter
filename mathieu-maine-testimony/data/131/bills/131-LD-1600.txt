2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §653, sub-§1, ¶D-1, as amended by PL 2021, c. 682, §2, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 D-1.  The estates up to the just value of $50,000  identified in this paragraph, having a 
5 taxable situs in the place of residence, for specially adapted housing units, of veterans 
6 who served in the Armed Forces of the United States during any federally recognized 
7 war period, including the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, the 
8 periods from August 24, 1982 to July 31, 1984 and December 20, 1989 to January 31, 
9 1990, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New 
10 Dawn, or during the period from February 1, 1955 to February 27, 1961, or who were 
11 awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and who are paraplegic veterans 
12 within the meaning of 38 United States Code, Chapter 21, Section 2101, and who 
13 received a grant from the United States Government for any such housing  rated as 
14 disabled by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as the result of a service-
15 related disability, or of the unremarried widows or widowers of those veterans.  A 
16 veteran of the Vietnam War must have served on active duty after February 27, 1961 
17 and before May 8, 1975.  "Persian Gulf War" means service on active duty on or after 
18 August 2, 1990 and before or on the date that the United States Government recognizes 
19 as the end of that war period.  The exemption provided in this paragraph applies to the 
20 property of the veteran including property held in joint tenancy with a spouse or held 
21 in a revocable living trust for the benefit of that veteran.
22 The amount of the exemption under this paragraph is equal to the just value of a 
23 veteran's estate multiplied by the percentage of the veteran's disability as rated by the 
24 United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
25 The State shall reimburse each municipality for the amount of the property tax 
26 exempted under this paragraph.
27Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §653, sub-§1, ¶H, as amended by PL 2007, c. 627, §22, is further 
28 amended to read:
29 H.  A  Except as provided in paragraph D-1, a municipality granting exemptions under 
30 this subsection is entitled to reimbursement from the State of 90% of that portion of 
31 the property tax revenue lost as a result of the exemptions that exceeds 3% of the total 
32 municipal property tax levy, upon submission of proof in a form satisfactory to the 
33 State Tax Assessor.   Exemptions granted under this subsection that are reimbursable 
34 pursuant to section 661 are not eligible for reimbursement under this paragraph.
35Sec. 3.  Application. This Act applies to property tax years beginning on or after 
36 April 1, 2024.
