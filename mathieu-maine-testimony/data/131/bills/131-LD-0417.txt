2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§1, ¶C-1 is enacted to read:
3 C-1.  "Net energy billing data" means customer information in the possession of a 
4 transmission and distribution utility that is necessary to conduct and administer a net 
5 energy billing arrangement, including but not limited to a customer's monthly 
6 electricity usage; rate and subrate classes; generated, applied or banked credits and 
7 related expiration dates; dollar value of charges offset by credits; credit rate per 
8 kilowatt-hour; participation in any other net energy billing or demand response 
9 program; energy production attributed to the customer; historical payment information; 
10 and other information as determined by rules adopted by the commission.
11Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§5-A is enacted to read:
125-A.  Customer protection; energy assistance.  Notwithstanding any provision of law 
13 to the contrary, a customer's participation in a net energy billing arrangement and any 
14 credits received through such participation may not prevent a customer's qualification for 
15 or receipt of benefits from any energy conservation or energy assistance program 
16 administered by the Maine State Housing Authority or the Efficiency Maine Trust.
17Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§9 is enacted to read:
189.  Utility data and crediting.  Net energy billing data is the property of the customer 
19 to which it relates. A customer may direct a transmission and distribution utility in writing 
20 to release net energy billing data to 3rd parties, including project sponsors, in order to 
21 administer a customer's net energy billing arrangement or to produce a consolidated bill so 
22 that the customer can easily understand the financial savings in a billing period resulting 
23 from the customer's participation in the net energy billing arrangement.  A transmission 
24 and distribution utility shall release the net energy billing data within 7 days of the date the 
25 net energy billing data is generated. In accordance with rules adopted by the commission, 
26 a transmission and distribution utility shall:
27 A.  Provide access by the customer to that customer's net energy billing data through 
28 an appropriate computer application or digital platform;
29 B.  When a customer is entering into a net energy billing arrangement with a project 
30 sponsor, provide confirmation of acceptance and implementation of the net energy 
31 billing arrangement to the customer and the project sponsor within 7 days of that 
32 acceptance;
33 C.  Apply unused net energy billing credits available from the oldest previous billing 
34 cycle to the customer's bill up to the full amount of the charges billed in that billing 
35 cycle before applying credits generated in the current billing cycle and newer unused 
36 credits; and
37 D.  Provide to a project sponsor, within 7 days after the end of a net energy billing 
38 cycle, the total energy production for the project, all net energy billing data necessary 
39 to implement all customers' net energy billing arrangements and any additional data 
40 that the commission may require by rule.
41Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§10 is enacted to read:
Page 2 - 131LR0798(01)110.  Billing errors.  A transmission and distribution utility shall correct any net energy 
2 billing errors made by the transmission and distribution utility within one billing cycle of 
3 the error and provide written confirmation to the customer and the project sponsor 
4 describing the error and what was done to correct the error. The commission may direct a 
5 transmission and distribution utility to pay to a customer any costs the commission finds to 
6 have been incurred by the customer as a direct result of that transmission and distribution 
7 utility's error.
8Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§11 is enacted to read:
911.  Complaints.  The commission shall establish a process for receiving and 
10 responding to complaints from project sponsors related to transmission and distribution 
11 utility compliance with subsection 10.
12SUMMARY
13 This bill establishes various requirements for transmission and distribution utilities to 
14 share information, handle billing and otherwise interact with customers and project 
15 sponsors in net energy billing arrangements. The bill requires the Public Utilities 
16 Commission to establish a complaint handling process for project sponsor complaints about 
17 transmission and distribution utility compliance with billing error requirements and 
18 provides that the commission may direct a transmission and distribution utility to pay costs 
19 resulting from billing errors.13
