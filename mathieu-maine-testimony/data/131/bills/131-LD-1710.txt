10SUMMARY
11 This bill requires the Maine State Housing Authority to establish and administer the 
12 Maine Rental Assistance and Guarantee Program.  The program must include a rental 
13 assistance component to assist individuals with the cost of rent and a rental guarantee 
14 component to encourage landlords to work with the program and other rental assistance 
15 programs in the State.  The bill also creates the Maine Rental Assistance and Guarantee 
16 Program Fund under the Maine State Housing Authority to carry out the program. The bill 
17 appropriates $75,500,000 of ongoing funds annually.
22 The bill amends the Maine Human Rights Act to include as prohibited acts the 
23 discrimination against a tenant because the tenant participates in a federal, state or local 
24 tenant-based rental assistance program and requires owners of more than 10 residential 
25 rental units to ensure that at least 10% of the rental units that they rent meet the definition 
26 of affordable housing.
27 The bill amends the laws governing the municipal general assistance program by 
28 redefining maximum levels of assistance to better reflect the cost of basic necessities 
29 experienced by persons who participate in the program. It requires the Department of 
30 Health and Human Services to develop a comprehensive application form for applicants of 
31 general assistance, emergency assistance and rental assistance. It requires municipalities to 
32 exceed the maximum levels of assistance in order to alleviate an emergency and requires 
33 the State to reimburse municipalities for 100% of additional expenditures. It requires 
34 municipalities to provide culturally appropriate and trauma-informed services when 
35 administering the general assistance program. It requires the Department of Health and 
36 Human Services to provide training to ensure that the municipalities comply with the 
37 requirements of the program. 
38 The bill amends the laws governing the real estate transfer tax by creating a graduated 
39 tax based upon the sales price of the real estate and dedicates those funds to assist in funding 
40 the Maine Rental Assistance and Guarantee Program.
41 The bill amends the Maine Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by further defining a 
42 debt collector as any entity that attempts to collect unpaid rent where the rent is 1
