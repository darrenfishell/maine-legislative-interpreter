Page 1 - 131LR0728(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine, representing the State's wild

5 significant concern because of the food traceability requirements imposed by the federal

8 would reduce the paperwork burden on farmers and businesses that transport wild 
9 blueberries in the State for the upcoming growing season; and
