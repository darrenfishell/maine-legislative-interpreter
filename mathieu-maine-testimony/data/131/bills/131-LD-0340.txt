4§101.  Statement of purpose
5 The purpose of this Title is to ensure that there is a regulatory system for public utilities 
6 in the State and for other entities subject to this Title that is consistent with the public 
7 interest and with other requirements of law and to provide for reasonable licensing 
8 requirements for competitive electricity providers.  The basic purpose of this regulatory 
9 system as it applies to public utilities subject to service regulation under this Title is to 
10 ensure safe, reasonable and adequate service, to assist in minimizing the cost of energy 
11 available to the State’s consumers, to ensure that the rates of public utilities subject to rate 
12 regulation are just and reasonable to customers and public utilities and to reduce 
13 greenhouse gas emissions to meet the greenhouse gas emissions reduction levels set forth 
14 in Title 38, section 576‑A  educate consumers to make independent and informed utility 
15 choices.
16SUMMARY
17 This bill removes the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the basic purpose of 
18 the State's regulatory system for public utilities and instead requires that the regulatory 
19 system educate consumers to make independent and informed utility choices. 17
