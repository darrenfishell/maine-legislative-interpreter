Page 1 - 131LR0675(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  4 MRSA ยง1807 is enacted to read:
3ยง1807.  Prepetition pilot program for families in the child protection system
4 The commission shall design and implement a 2-year pilot program to provide legal 
5 counsel and related advocacy services to a target population of parents or custodians of a 
6 child at the prepetition stage, or when the Department of Health and Human Services 
7 commences an investigation of a report of suspected abuse or neglect to determine if a child 
8 is at risk of harm.
91.  Goals.  The commission shall design the pilot program to meet the following goals:
10 A.  To provide legal and other resources to parents and custodians early in the child 
11 protection investigation process so that children can remain safe and families can help 
12 their children thrive without the need for further state intervention;
13 B.  To promote equity in the outcome of child protection investigations for families of 
14 disparate socioeconomic circumstances; and
15 C.  To increase parents' and custodians' understanding of the child protection 
16 investigation process and how they can engage in the process to achieve positive 
17 outcomes.
182.  Target population.  The commission, in partnership with the Department of Health 
19 and Human Services, shall design the pilot program to serve parents and custodians who 
20 have become the subject of a child protection investigation, who reside within 
21 Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford counties and who are indigent and would qualify for 
22 the assignment of counsel completely at state expense under the eligibility standards 
23 established by the commission pursuant to section 1804, subsection 2, paragraph A, except 
24 that only the parent's or custodian's income and not the parent's or custodian's assets may 
25 be considered when determining assignment of counsel. The program may serve up to 30 
26 families at any given time. For the purposes of this section, "family" means a group of 
27 individuals subject to a single child protection investigation.
283.  Services provided.  The commission shall provide services under the pilot program 
29 to parents and custodians in their dealings with the Department of Health and Human 
30 Services. The commission shall also provide advocacy services regarding other civil legal 
31 issues related to the child protection matter.
324.  Service providers.  The commission shall partner with attorneys and other service 
33 providers in delivering services under the pilot program. Nonattorney service providers 
34 may include, but are not limited to, case managers, parents with lived experience of the 
35 child protection system and social workers.
365.  Warmline and referrals.  The commission shall implement a "warmline" that 
37 provides information and referrals statewide to parents and custodians who are subject to 
38 child protection investigations and that will also screen parents and custodians for 
39 eligibility to receive pilot program services. The commission shall prepare informational 
40 materials regarding the warmline and a parent's or custodian's ability to contact the 
41 warmline and self-refer to the pilot program. The commission shall collaborate with the 
42 Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that parents and custodians who fall 
43 within the target population are made aware of the pilot program.
Page 2 - 131LR0675(01)16.  Data collection and assessment.  The commission, in partnership with the 
2 Department of Health and Human Services, shall conduct an independent evaluation of the 
3 pilot program, using existing resources when available. The commission shall engage in 
4 ongoing data collection related to the program and shall report its findings after one year 
5 of program implementation and at 6-month intervals thereafter to the joint standing 
6 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over the judiciary and the joint standing 
7 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters.
8Sec. 2.  22 MRSA ยง4005-I is enacted to read:
9ยง4005-I.  Prepetition pilot program information and referrals
10 The department shall coordinate with the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal 
11 Services to provide information to the public regarding the "warmline" described under 
12 Title 4, section 1807, subsection 5 and to ensure that parents and custodians who may be 
13 eligible to be served by the pilot program established in Title 4, section 1807 are provided 
14 with information regarding the pilot program.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill directs the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services to design and 
17 implement a 2-year pilot program to provide legal counsel and related advocacy services 
18 to indigent parents and custodians residing in Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford counties 
19 when the Department of Health and Human Services commences an investigation of a 
20 report of suspected abuse or neglect to determine if a child is at risk of harm. It directs the 
21 commission to establish a "warmline" to provide information and referrals statewide to 
22 parents and custodians who are subject to child protection investigations and to screen 
23 parents and custodians for eligibility to receive pilot program services. It directs the 
24 Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Maine Commission on 
25 Indigent Legal Services to provide information to the public regarding the warmline and 
26 pilot program.16
