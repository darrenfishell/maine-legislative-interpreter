24 parcel of land and the division of an existing structure or structures previously used for 
25 commercial or industrial use into 3  4 or more dwelling units within a 5-year period.
26 A.  In determining whether a tract or parcel of land is divided into 3 or more lots, the 
27 first dividing of the tract or parcel is considered to create the first 2 lots and the next 
28 dividing of either of these first 2 lots, by whomever accomplished, is considered to 
29 create a 3rd lot, unless:
30 (1)  Both dividings are accomplished by a subdivider who has retained one of the 
31 lots for the subdivider's own use as a single-family residence that has been the 
32 subdivider's principal residence for a period of at least 5 years immediately 
33 preceding the 2nd division; or
34 (2)  The division of the tract or parcel is otherwise exempt under this subchapter.
35 B.  The dividing of a tract or parcel of land and the lot or lots so made, which dividing 
36 or lots when made are not subject to this subchapter, do not become subject to this 
37 subchapter by the subsequent dividing of that tract or parcel of land or any portion of 
38 that tract or parcel.  The municipal reviewing authority shall consider the existence of 
39 the previously created lot or lots in reviewing a proposed subdivision created by a

13 purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives 
14 of this subchapter.
15 D-4.  A division accomplished by gift to a person related to the donor of an interest in 
16 property held by the donor for a continuous period of 5 years prior to the division by 
17 gift does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of 
18 the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter.  If the real estate exempt 
19 under this paragraph is transferred within 5 years to another person not related to the 
20 donor of the exempt real estate as provided in this paragraph, then the previously 
21 exempt division creates a lot or lots for the purposes of this subsection.  "Person related 
22 to the donor" means a spouse, parent, grandparent, brother, sister  sibling, child or

30 land abutting that land does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, 
31 unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter.  If the

36 lots permanent dwelling structures legally existed before September 23, 1971 is not a

39 subsection regarding the determination of the number of lots apply, including 
40 exemptions from the definition of a subdivision of land.

46 paragraph takes effect shall comply with this subsection no later than January 1, 2021.  
47 Such a municipality must file its conflicting definition at the county registry of deeds 
48 by June 30, 2020 for the definition to remain valid for the grace period ending January

9 the definition of subdivision under paragraphs D‑1 to D‑6, or subsequent transfer of 
10 that entire lot by the original holder of the security interest or that person's successor 
11 in interest, does not create a lot for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of 
12 the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter.

23SUMMARY
24 This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing subdivisions.
25 1.  It removes from subdivision review any projects that would result in the construction 
26 or placement of, or the division of an existing structure into, 3 dwelling units on a single 
27 tract or parcel of land. Current law provides that any such projects that would result in 3 or 
28 more dwelling units may be subject to subdivision review.
29 2.  It removes from subdivision review any projects that would result in the construction 
30 or placement of, or the division of an existing structure into, more than 3 but not more than 
31 18 dwelling units on a single lot located in a designated growth area within a municipality 
32 where the project is subject to municipal site plan review.
33 3.  It adopts a definition for "administrative reviewing authority," which means a 
34 municipal employee or other designee of a municipality. It also provides that the 
35 administrative reviewing authority must review any subdivision application that proposes 
36 the construction or placement of, or the division of an existing structure into, more than 3 
37 but not more than 18 dwelling units on a single lot in a designated growth area and, if the 
38 municipality has adopted a municipal site plan review ordinance, the administrative 
39 reviewing authority must review the application in accordance with the municipal site plan 
40 review process.
41 4.  It requires a municipal reviewing authority, when reviewing an application for 
42 subdivision approval, to determine that the proposed subdivision is not located in an area 1
