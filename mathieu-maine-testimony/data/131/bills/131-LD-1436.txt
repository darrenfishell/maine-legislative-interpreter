14SUMMARY
15 This bill eliminates the crime of engaging in prostitution.  It provides for the sealing of 
16 a person's criminal history record for the former crime of engaging in prostitution.  It 
17 establishes a stakeholder group within the Department of Health and Human Services to 
18 identify funds that may be able to be used to provide services to those persons who 
19 experienced violence associated with commercial sexual exploitation and to report that 
20 information to the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety.  It also 
21 directs the Department of Public Safety to report biennially to the joint standing committees 
22 of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters and criminal 
23 justice and public safety matters related to the number of convictions of certain crimes, the 
24 fines imposed, requests regarding sealing criminal records and support services provided.15
