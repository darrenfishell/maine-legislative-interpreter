33SUMMARY
34 This bill removes the legal presence requirement to obtain a driver's license or 
35 nondriver identification card.  The bill removes the requirement that an applicant for a 
36 driver's license provide written proof that the applicant is ineligible to receive a social 
37 security number if the applicant is not providing a social security number on the application 
38 for a driver's license.  The bill repeals provisions that require a driver's license or nondriver 
39 identification card issued to an applicant who is not a citizen or a legal permanent resident 
40 of the United States to expire coterminously with the applicant's authorized duration of stay 
41 or the otherwise applicable expiration date of the license or card, whichever occurs first.  34
