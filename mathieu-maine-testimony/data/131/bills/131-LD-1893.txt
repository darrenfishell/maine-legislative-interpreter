6 option fee.  The referendum question must indicate the rate of the local option fee.
7 The petition process and voting must be held and conducted in accordance with sections 
8 2528, 2529 and 2532 even if the municipality has not accepted the provisions of section

11 the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall forward the results to the State Tax

15 under this subsection.
169.  Effective date of fee for short-term rentals; acceptance by voters.  A local option 
17 fee authorized by this section takes effect 120 days after the municipal referendum vote 
18 under subsection 8 if it is accepted by a majority of the legal voters voting at the election 
19 and the total number of votes cast equals or exceeds 20% of the total number of votes cast 
20 in the municipality in the most recent gubernatorial election, except that a local option fee 
21 for short-term rentals may not take effect before July 1, 2024.

23 This bill allows a municipality to impose, if approved by referendum of the voters in

25 rooming house or tourist or trailer camp currently subject to the 9% sales tax on lodging, 
26 including a short-term accommodation rental rented through a transient rental platform. 
27 Long-term rentals currently exempt from sales tax are not subject to the short-term rental 
28 fee.  The revenue from the local option fee is distributed to the municipality imposing the 
29 local option fee.
30 Revenue received by a municipality from a local option fee imposed on short-term 
31 rentals may not be used to reduce or eliminate funding otherwise due to the municipality 
32 under other provisions of law.  The local option fee may not take effect before July 1, 2024.1
