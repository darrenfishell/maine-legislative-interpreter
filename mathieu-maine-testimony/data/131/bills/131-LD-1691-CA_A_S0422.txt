This bill waives annual reg1strat10n fees for registered caregivers m the medical cannabis program 1f the Office of 
Cannabis Policy (OCP) has deemed them compliant with applicable rules and regulations and they received an annual 
mspect10n m the pnor year The bill also provides that cannabis busmesses, which were otherwise eligible for 
financial energy rate rehefprov1ded as a result of Resolve 2021, c 168 but were not provided the rehefbecause the 
busmess was engaged m a cannabis-related activity, are entitled to receive the financial rehef they would have 
received with fundmg transferred from the Medical Use of Cannabis Fund (Medical Use Fund) or the Adult Use 
Cannabis Public Health and Safety and Mumc1pal Opt-m Fund (Adult Use Fund) 
The OCP has mdicated that at current staffing levels, annual mspect10ns of registered caregivers occur once every 2 to 
3 yeaIS and that add1t10nal staffing and resources will be required to mcrease the frequency of mspect10ns to an annual 
basis The bill mcludes ongomg General Fund appropnat10ns of $947,397 beginmng m fiscal year 2023-24 for 7 Field 
Investigator pos1t10ns, 2 Field Investigator Supervisor pos1t1ons and associated All Other costs These pos1t10ns are 
not funded by allocat10ns from the Medical Fund as mcreased mspectlons will mcrease the number of caregivers 
eligible to receive waived annual reg1strat10n fees, which will reduce revenue to the Medical Use Fund by $1,572,236 
beginnmg m fiscal year 2023-24 
C #1-(S·'"lt.~ 
It is estnnated that roughly 2,311 medical cannabis busmesses and 258 adult use cannabis busmesses would be 
eligible to receive the energy rate rehef proposed m this bill Under Resolve 2021, c 168, the average rehef payment 
was $2,398 Usmg this average, the estimated transfer from the Medical Use Fund will be $5,541,778 and the 
estimated transfer from the Adult Use Fund will be $618,684 Without addit10nal mformatton from utthty providers 
an exact estimate is unable to be completed at this time It is noted that the large transfer from the Medical Use Fun<.i. 
may Jeopardize its mtended use as fundmg for the Office of Cannabis Pohcy 
Addmg cannabis to the defimt10n of commercial agncultural product10n associated with the sales tax refund on 
depreciable machmery and eqmpment will reduce General Fund revenue by mmor amounts
