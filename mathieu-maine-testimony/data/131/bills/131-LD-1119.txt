24 B.  If the State pleads and proves that, at the time any crime, excluding murder, under

26 paragraph A; or section 752‑A or , 752‑C or 752-F was committed, or an attempt of any

41 This paragraph does not apply to murder under section 201 or to section 853-A.
Page 2 - 131LR0717(01)1Sec. 4.  22 MRSA §832-A, sub-§1, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 292, §1, is

5 emergency medical services persons, defined in Title 32, section 83, subsection 12, but 
6 does not include a firefighter.
7SUMMARY
8 Under current law, a person is guilty of a Class C crime if that person intentionally, 
9 knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to an emergency medical care provider, as 
10 that term is defined in the law, while the provider is providing emergency care.  This bill 
11 amends the law by specifying that it is a Class C crime if the bodily injury is to:
12 1.  A person licensed pursuant to the Maine Emergency Medical Services Act of 1982, 
13 regardless of the location where the emergency medical care is provided; or
14 2.  A person employed or contracted by a hospital and the injury occurs in the hospital's 
15 designated emergency room.
16 The bill also amends the law governing elevating the class of a crime to include assaults 
17 on emergency medical services providers.
18 The bill also makes a technical change to the definition of "emergency medical care 
19 provider" in the law governing emergency blood-borne pathogen testing. Currently, that 
20 term is defined by providing a cross-reference to a term the bill repeals.8
