voucher to eligible Maine recipients to offset some of the expenses that have been incuned, 
and will be incurred in the winter months of 2022-2023, by those recipients as a result of 
high winter energy costs and the COVID-19 pandemic, including, without limitation, 
personal, family and living expenses.

SUMMARY 
This amendment makes the following changes to the bill.. 
1. It reduces the time frame for the Maine State Housing Authority to prioritize funding 
to address emergency housing needs to 3 months instead of 5 months as in the bill and 
reduces the amount transferred from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund for 
that purpose. 
2. It replaces the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program with the Winter Energy 
Relief Fuel Voucher Program. The new program provides for a $450 payment per eligible 
individual. An eligible individual is a person who, for the tax year beginning January 1, 
2021, filed a Maine income tax return as a full-year resident for that tax year and has federal 
adjusted gross income of no more than $50,000 if filing single, $75,000 if filing as head of 
household or $100,000 if married filing jointly. 
3. It limits the provision in the bill that allows the Commissioner of Environmental 
Protection to suspend the sulfur content requirements for liquid and solid fossil fuels if the 
commissioner finds that the expected availability of fuel that complies with those 
requirements is inadequate to meet the needs of residential, commercial or industrial users 
in this State and that such expected unavailability constitutes an immediate threat to public 
health, safety or the general welfare. The suspension expires no later than May 1, 2024. 
4. It establishes the Home Energy Savings Account Program to allow individuals and 
married couples to open a home energy savings account into which annual deposits of up 
to $2,500 for an individual and $5,000 for a married couple may be made. The amount 
deposited is exempt from Maine income tax but may be used only for the weatherization 
of the account holder's residence or the payment of fuel or electricity costs incurred for 
heating the account holder's residence; funds withdrawn and used for any other purpose are 
subject to Maine income tax. The residence must be located in Maine. Balances in the 
accounts do not lapse but are carried forward each year. The Home Energy Savings 
Account Program is administered by the Finance Authority of Maine.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The amounts above reflect the incremental change from the original bill. 
This amendment shortens the timeframe that funds are available for emergency housing needs from 5 months to 3 
months and reduces the transfer from the General Fund unappropriated surplus to the Emergency Housing Relief Fund 
Program within the Maine State Housing Authority by $8,400,000 from $21,000,000 to $12,600,000. The allocation is 
also reduced by $8,400,000. 
The amendment changes the distribution of heating assistance from checks to fuel vouchers and changes the name of 
the program to the Winter Energy Relief Fuel Voucher Program. The amount of allocation and the transfer from the 
General Fund remain at $398,000,000. The amendment lowers the income eligibility limits for individuals to qualify 
for assistance. The cost of the vouchers is anticipated to be approximately $288,488,200. The costs to design and 
implement a voucher system, including internal controls and verification, are expected to be significant and 
implementation by Maine Revenue Services in a short period of time may be difficult. As in the original bill, any 
balance remaining at the end of fiscal year 2023-24 will be transferred to the unappropriated surplus of the General 
Fund. 
LR0601(06) -Fiscal Note -Pagel of2 
The amendment also creates an income tax deduction ofup to $2,500 per individual, or $5,000 per married couple, for 
contributions made into Home Energy Savings Accounts. It is estimated that this may result in revenue reductions of 
$42,750 in fiscal year 2023-24 to the General Fund and $2,250 to the Local Government Fund and reductions of 
$293,550 in fiscal year 2024-25 to the General Fund and $15,450 to the Local Government Fund. A General Fund 
appropriation to the Department of Adminstrative and Financial Services of $35,000 is included in.fiscal year 2022-23 
for computer programming costs to update individual income tax forms. 
The Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) anticipates that it will incur significant ongoing costs, including personnel, 
programming, marketing and rulemaking costs, to establish and administer the Home Energy Savings Account 
Program beginning in fiscal year 2022-23. Additionally, given the amount of time required to conduct rulemaking, 
hire and train personnel, engage financial institutions and implement an interface system with participating financial 
institutions, the ability of FAME to implement the program to be available during the 2022-2023 heating season is 
unlikely.
