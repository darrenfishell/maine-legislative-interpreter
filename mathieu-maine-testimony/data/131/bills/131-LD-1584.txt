Page 1 - 131LR2484(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Government increased the 
4 level of benefits available under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, 
5 or SNAP; and
6Whereas, those extended benefits are scheduled to expire March 1, 2023; and
7Whereas, due to rising costs of food and other necessities of living, the sudden 
8 termination of these benefits creates a crisis for families that depend on the extended 
9 benefits; and
10Whereas, in order to avoid that crisis, the level of benefits under SNAP needs to be 
11 restored as soon as possible and recipients given a chance to adjust to a lower level of 
12 benefits; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore,
17Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18Sec. 1.  Appropriations and allocations.  The following appropriations and 
19 allocations are made.
