25SUMMARY
26 The current Class D crime of endangering the welfare of a child under the Maine 
27 Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 554, subsection 1, paragraph C is established when a 
28 person violates a duty of care or protection to a child and thereby recklessly endangers the 
29 child.  This bill amends the provision to more accurately describe the crime by attaching 
30 the culpable mental state element of recklessness, which is a conscious disregard of a risk 
31 that involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable and prudent 
32 person would observe, to the violation of the duty.  The bill amends the laws governing the 
33 crime by enacting more serious penalty provisions if the person’s reckless violation of the 
34 duty of care or protection results in death of or serious bodily injury to the child.  If the 
35 child suffers serious bodily injury as a result, the crime is a Class C crime; if the child dies, 
36 the crime is a Class B crime.  The bill makes all 3 provisions parallel in their description 
37 of the prohibited conduct.
38 The bill establishes the Class B crime of aggravated endangering the welfare of a child.  
39 A person is guilty of aggravated endangering the welfare of a child if that person endangers 
40 the health, safety or welfare of a child by recklessly violating a duty of care or protection, 26
