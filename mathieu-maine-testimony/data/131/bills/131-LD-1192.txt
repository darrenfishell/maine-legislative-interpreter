39 of Justices of the Superior Court and the number of Judges of the District Court.
40 1.  Each associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court appointed prior to the effective 
41 date of this Act may continue to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court 
42 until the expiration of the term to which the associate justice was appointed.
Page 2 - 131LR2281(01)1 2.  The first time after the effective date of this Act that the term of an associate justice 
2 of the Supreme Judicial Court expires or an associate justice’s term ends due to the justice’s 
3 death or resignation, the Governor shall, instead of reappointing that associate justice or 
4 appointing a new associate justice, appoint a Justice of the Superior Court. When a Justice 
5 of the Superior Court is appointed under this subsection, the judicial branch shall transfer 
6 at least 2 judicial support positions, which may include a Deputy Marshal position, an 
7 Associate Clerk position, a Judicial Administrative Assistant position or a Law Clerk 
8 position, from the Supreme Judicial Court to the Superior Court. Prior to the date that a

12 3. The 2nd time after the effective date of this Act that the term of an associate justice 
13 of the Supreme Judicial Court expires or an associate justice’s term ends due to the justice’s 
14 death or resignation, the Governor shall, instead of reappointing that associate justice or 
15 appointing a new associate justice, appoint a Judge of the District Court.  When a Judge of 
16 the District Court is appointed under this subsection, the judicial branch shall transfer at 
17 least 2 judicial support positions, which may include a Deputy Marshal position, an 
18 Associate Clerk position, a Judicial Administrative Assistant position or a Law Clerk

20 Judge of the District Court is appointed by the Governor under this subsection, the District 
21 Court may not consist of more than 39 judges who are not Active Retired Judges.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill reduces from 6 to 4 the number of associate justices on the Supreme Judicial 
24 Court and increases by one both the number of Justices of the Superior Court and the 
25 number of Judges of the District Court.  To effectuate a smooth transition, the bill directs 
26 the Governor to appoint the new Superior Court Justice when the term of the first associate 
27 justice of the Supreme Judicial Court ends after the effective date of this legislation due to 
28 the associate justice’s death or resignation or the expiration of the associate justice’s current 
29 term. The Governor shall appoint the new District Court Judge when the term of the 2nd 
30 associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court ends after the effective date of this 
31 legislation due to the associate justice’s death or resignation or the expiration of the 
32 associate justice’s current term.
33 The bill also provides for the transfer of 2 judicial support positions, which may include 
34 Deputy Marshal positions, Assistant Clerk positions, Judicial Administrative Assistant 
35 positions or Law Clerk positions, from the Supreme Judicial Court to the Superior Court 
36 when the first associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court’s term of office ends and that 
37 justice is replaced by a Superior Court Justice.  The bill similarly provides for the transfer 
38 of 2 judicial support positions from the Supreme Judicial Court to the District Court when 
39 the 2nd associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court’s term of office ends and that justice 
40 is replaced by a District Court Judge.23
