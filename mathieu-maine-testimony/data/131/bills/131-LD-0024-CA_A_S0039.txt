the following meanings. 
1. Licensed camping facility. "Licensed camping facility" means a recreational 
camp, youth camp or camping area licensed under Title 22, section 2495. 
2. Recreational campfire. "Recreational campfire" means an out-of-door fire that is 
used for cooking, personal warmth, light or ceremonial or aesthetic purposes and that is not

lantern designed to emit light resulting from combustion or a stove that is used inside a

16 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, from issuing a permit or other permission for open 
17 burning to take place in a geographic area subject to a red flag warning. This amendment,

19 growers by allowing the director or director's delegate to issue a permit for a controlled 
20 bum on a commercially managed wild blueberry field in a geographic area subject to a red 
21 flag warning as long as the application for the permit includes a prescribed bum plan 
22 approved by the issuing authority. 
23 The bill requires the director or the director's delegate to revoke any permit for open 
24 burning in a geographic area in which a red flag warning is in effect. The amendment 
25 provides that the director or the director's delegate is not required to revoke a permit for a 
26 controlled bum on a commercially managed wild blueberry field during the period in which 
27 a red flag warning is in effect if the permit includes an approved prescribed bum plan. 
28 The amendment clarifies that a red flag warning is a forecast warning issued by the 
29 United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
30 Administration, National Weather Service in consultation with the Bureau of Forestry. 
31 The bill prohibits a person who kindles or uses a recreational campfire from allowing 
32 the recreational campfire to exceed 3 feet in diameter on the ground at the base of the fire 
33 or 3 feet in height. The amendment exempts a licensed camp facility from this prohibition. 
34 The bill prohibits open burning, both permissible open burning with a permit and 
35 permissible open burning without a permit, during the period in which a red flag warning
