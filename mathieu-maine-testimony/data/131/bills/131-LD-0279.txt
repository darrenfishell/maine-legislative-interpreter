20 individual from participation in a service, program or activity of that public entity or 
21 otherwise deny to an individual the benefits of a service, program or activity of that public 
22 entity by reason of the individual's race or color, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity, 
23 age, physical or mental disability, religion, ancestry or national origin. It amends existing 
24 sections of the Maine Human Rights Act to create consistency with the new section.18
