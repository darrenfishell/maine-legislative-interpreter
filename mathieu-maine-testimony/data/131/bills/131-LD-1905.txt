11 This bill creates a residential rental unit registry administered by the Department of 
12 Economic and Community Development in which all residential property owners must 
13 register all residential rental units except for units provided as subsidized housing or 
14 registered on a municipal registry.  A municipality may receive data from the registry 
15 regarding residential rental units in that municipality and, if the municipality maintains a 
16 residential rental property registry, is required to provide registry data to the department. A 
17 residential landlord may not serve notice to terminate a tenant for nonpayment of rent if the 
18 tenant's residential rental unit is not registered as required and may not serve the tenant 
19 with a notice to terminate for nonpayment of rent less than 120 days after registering; in 
20 either case the owner commits a civil violation for which a fine in the amount of 3 times 
21 the monthly rent of the unit must be adjudged. A housing authority is required to provide 
22 residential rental unit and tenant data on housing provided or subsidized by the authority 
23 to the department. The department is also required to list the rights of tenants regarding the 
24 registry in any pamphlet, publication or publicly accessible website of the department 
25 listing or explaining tenants' rights.11
