Page 1 - 131LR0569(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §5224, sub-§2, ¶H, as repealed and replaced by PL 2019, c. 
3 140, §1, is amended by amending subparagraph (1) to read:
4 (1)  A development district that is a tax increment financing district may not exceed 
5 a total of 30 tax years beginning with the tax year in which the designation of the 
6 development district is effective pursuant to section 5226, subsection 3 or, if 
7 specified in the development program, the subsequent tax year; and , except that a 
8 district may be extended an additional 30 years if the district uses at least 51% of 
9 state tax increment revenue for affordable housing projects or transit-oriented 
10 development.  A district that is extended under this subparagraph may continue to 
11 use the original assessed value of the district.
12 For purposes of this subparagraph, "affordable housing" means a decent, safe and 
13 sanitary dwelling, apartment or other living accommodation for a household whose 
14 income does not exceed 120% of the median income for the area as defined by the 
15 United States Department of Housing and Urban Development under the United 
16 States Housing Act of 1937, Public Law 75-412, 50 Stat. 888, Section 8; "transit-
17 oriented development" means a type of development that links land use with transit 
18 facilities by combining housing with complementary public uses, including jobs, 
19 retail or services establishments that are located in transit-served nodes or 
20 corridors; and "original assessed value" means the taxable assessed value of a 
21 district as of March 31st of the tax year preceding the year in which it was 
22 designated by a municipality and approved by the commissioner under section 
23 5226, subsection 2; and
24SUMMARY
25 This bill allows a development district that is a tax increment financing district to be 
26 extended an additional 30 years if the district uses at least 51% of state tax increment 
27 revenue for affordable housing or transit-oriented development.25
