Page 1 - 131LR0269(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  19-A MRSA §1653, sub-§6-C, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 577, §1, is 
3 amended to read:
46-C.  Forensic risk evaluation or assessment.  Upon motion from either party or upon 
5 the court’s own motion, the court may order a parent to complete a forensic risk evaluation 
6 or assessment performed by a licensed clinical social worker, psychologist or psychiatrist 
7 qualified to conduct psychosexual evaluations.
8 A.  In determining whether to order a forensic risk evaluation or assessment, the court 
9 may consider:
10 (1)  The existence of any court findings, including but not limited to a criminal 
11 conviction, that the parent has committed a child-related sexual offense as defined 
12 in subsection 6‑A, paragraph A or dissemination of sexually explicit material or 
13 possession of sexually explicit material as described in Title 17‑A, chapter 12;
14 (2)  The existence of substantiated findings of abuse or neglect under Title 22, 
15 section 4004, subsection 2, paragraph C‑1, or an equivalent finding from another 
16 state, against the parent involving a child-related sexual offense as defined in 
17 subsection 6‑A, paragraph A or dissemination of sexually explicit material or 
18 possession of sexually explicit material as described in Title 17‑A, chapter 12;
19 (3)  Whether a guardian ad litem appointed to the case recommends the evaluation 
20 or assessment; and
21 (4)  Any other factor the court considers relevant.
22 B.  The court may order that the person performing the forensic risk evaluation or 
23 assessment may interview the parent who is the subject of the order and any other 
24 parent of the child and have access to court documents, records of any interview with 
25 the child and other relevant documents.
26 C.  The court shall order that the parent ordered to complete the forensic risk evaluation 
27 or assessment is responsible for any fees associated with the evaluation or assessment 
28 unless another parent agrees to pay part or all of the fees.
29 D.  If the parent ordered to complete the forensic risk evaluation or assessment has 
30 completed an evaluation or assessment in the past year, the court may order the parent 
31 to release that evaluation or assessment to the court, the guardian ad litem or another 
32 party and may order the parent to complete a new evaluation or assessment only if the 
33 court determines a new evaluation or assessment is necessary.
34 E.  In a matter involving the existence of domestic abuse between the parents, in the 
35 past or currently, the court in an action to award parental rights and responsibilities 
36 may not qualify an expert witness to provide a forensic evaluation or assessment 
37 regarding how the court should structure parental rights and responsibilities to achieve 
38 the best interest of the child unless the court finds the witness has training and 
39 demonstrated expertise on at least the following topics:
40 (1)  The domestic abuse tactics affecting parent and child safety after separation of 
41 parents;
Page 2 - 131LR0269(01)1 (2)  The effects of domestic abuse and violence on children and conditions that 
2 support resilience;
3 (3)  Best practices for recognizing, asking about and assessing the effects of abuse 
4 on the parent-child relationship; and
5 (4)  Methods for reducing post-separation abuse of the nonabusing parent and 
6 promoting child safety and security.
7SUMMARY
8 This bill provides that the court may qualify an expert witness to provide a forensic 
9 evaluation or assessment regarding parental rights and responsibilities in cases involving 
10 domestic abuse only if that expert can show a certain level of training and expertise in how 
11 domestic abuse and violence continue after separation of parents and affect child resilience, 
12 safety and security.  The bill also changes the term "forensic risk assessment" to "forensic 
13 evaluation or assessment" in the laws governing court orders for parental rights and 
14 responsibilities.8
