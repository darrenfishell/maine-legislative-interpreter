Page 1 - 131LR1781(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §965, sub-§1, ¶B-1, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 752, §2, is 
3 amended to read:
4 B-1.  For a public employer that is a school district administrative unit and the 
5 bargaining agent representing teachers employees within that school district  unit, to 
6 meet within 10 days after receipt of written notice from the other party requesting a 
7 meeting for collective bargaining purposes, as long as the parties have not otherwise 
8 agreed in a prior written contract.   This exception does not apply in circumstances 
9 relating to wages, hours, working conditions or contract grievance arbitration.  This 
10 obligation is suspended during the period between a referendum approving a new 
11 regional school unit and the operational date of the regional school unit, as long as the 
12 parties meet at reasonable times during that period;
13SUMMARY
14 Current law provides that the obligation of a public employer that is a school district 
15 and a bargaining agent representing teachers to bargain collectively includes their mutual 
16 obligation to meet within 10 days after receipt of written notice from the other party 
17 requesting a meeting for collective bargaining purposes.  This bill changes the scope of the 
18 law from school districts to school administrative units and from teachers to employees of 
19 the school administrative unit.  It also adds an exception to the mutual obligation to meet 
20 if the parties have otherwise agreed in a prior written contract.  It provides that this 
21 exception does not apply in circumstances relating to wages, hours, working conditions or 
22 contract grievance arbitration.14
