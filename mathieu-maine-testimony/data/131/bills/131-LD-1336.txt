6 organization receives contributions or makes expenditures to influence a municipal 
7 campaign in towns or cities with a population of 15,000 or more, that organization must 
8 register and file reports with the municipal clerk as required by Title 30‑A, section 2502. 
9 If an organization qualifies as a ballot question committee under section 1052, subsection 
10 2-A and that organization makes expenditures exceeding $5,000 to influence a municipal 
11 referendum campaign in a town or city with a population of less than 15,000, that 
12 organization must register and file reports with the municipal clerk as required by Title 
13 30-A, section 2502, subsection 2. The reports must be filed in accordance with the reporting 
14 schedule in section 1059 and must contain the information listed in section 1060.  A 
15 committee registered with the commission and that receives contributions or makes 
16 expenditures relating to a municipal election shall file a copy of the report containing such 
17 contributions or expenditures with the clerk in the subject municipality.  The commission 
18 retains the sole authority to prescribe the content of all reporting forms.  The commission 
19 does not have responsibility to oversee the filing of registrations or campaign finance 
20 reports relating to municipal campaigns.  If a municipal clerk becomes aware of a potential 
21 violation of this subchapter that the clerk considers to be substantial, the clerk may refer 
22 the matter to the commission for enforcement.  The commission may conduct an 
23 investigation if the information referred by the municipal clerk shows sufficient grounds 
24 for believing that a violation may have occurred.  After conducting the investigation, if the 
25 commission determines that a violation of this subchapter has occurred, the commission 
26 may assess penalties provided in this subchapter.
27Sec. 2.  30-A MRSA §2502, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2011, c. 389, §60 and 
28 affected by §62, is further amended to read:
292.  Municipal referenda campaigns.  Municipal referenda campaigns in towns or 
30 cities with a population of 15,000 or more are governed by Title 21‑A, chapter 13, 
31 subchapter 4.  The registrations and reports of political action committees and ballot 
32 question committees must be filed with the municipal clerk.  A  Except as provided in 
33 paragraph A, a town or city with a population of less than 15,000 may choose to be 
34 governed by Title 21‑A, chapter 13, subchapter 4 by vote of its legislative body at least 90 
35 days before a referendum election.   A town or city that votes to adopt those provisions 
36 may revoke that decision, but it must do so at least 90 days before an election subject to 
37 that subchapter.
38 A.  If an organization qualifies as a ballot question committee under Title 21-A, section 
39 1052, subsection 2-A and that organization makes expenditures exceeding $5,000 to 
40 influence a municipal referendum campaign in a town or city with a population of less 
41 than 15,000, that organization must file the registrations and reports with the municipal 
42 clerk.
