2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §1801, sub-§2-A is enacted to read:
32-A.  Mechanical data.  "Mechanical data" means any vehicle-specific data, including 
4 telematics system data, generated by, stored in or transmitted by a motor vehicle and used 
5 in the diagnosis, repair or maintenance of a motor vehicle.
6Sec. 2.  29-A MRSA §1801, sub-§6 is enacted to read:
76.  Telematics system.  "Telematics system" means a system in a motor vehicle that 
8 collects information generated by the operation of the vehicle and transmits that 
9 information using wireless communications to a remote receiving point where the 
10 information is stored or used.
11Sec. 3.  29-A MRSA §1810 is enacted to read:
12§1810.  Right to repair
131.  Access to diagnostic systems.  Access to the vehicle on-board diagnostic systems 
14 of all motor vehicles, including commercial motor vehicles and heavy duty vehicles having 
15 a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 14,000 pounds, must be standardized and made 
16 accessible to owners and independent repair facilities and the access may not require 
17 authorization by the manufacturer, directly or indirectly, unless that authorization is 
18 standardized across all makes and models of motor vehicles sold in this State and is 
19 administered by the independent entity described in subsection 2.
202.  Independent entity.  The Attorney General shall designate an independent entity 
21 not controlled by one or more motor vehicle manufacturers to establish and administer 
22 access to vehicle-generated data that is available through the on-board diagnostic system 
23 or that is transmitted by the standardized access platform authorized under this section. The 
24 independent entity must consist of one representative each from a cross section of industry 
25 trade groups including but not limited to organizations representing motor vehicle 
26 manufacturers, aftermarket parts manufacturers, aftermarket parts distributors and retailers, 
27 independent motor vehicle service providers and new car dealers.  The independent entity 
28 shall manage cyber-secure access to motor vehicle-generated data, including ensuring on 
29 an ongoing basis that access to the on-board diagnostic system and standardized access 
30 platform is secure based on all applicable United States and international standards.  The

22SUMMARY
23 This initiated bill requires manufacturers of certain motor vehicles to standardize the 
24 vehicle on-board diagnostic systems and make those systems accessible to owners and 
25 independent repair facilities.  It requires the Attorney General to designate an independent 
26 entity to administer the accessibility of vehicle on-board diagnostic systems by adopting 
27 standards and developing policies. The initiated bill requires the release of certain 
28 diagnostic repair tools, parts, software and components depending on model year of the 
29 motor vehicle.  It also requires certain motor vehicles to be equipped with a standard access 
30 platform and provides exclusions for information otherwise required to be shared with 
31 owners or independent repair shops if that information is necessary for immobilizer 
32 systems or security-related modules. The initiated bill provides for enforcement by civil 
33 action of the provisions related to access and information sharing and provides the available 
34 damages.  It also requires that the Attorney General establish a notice relating to motor 
35 vehicle telematics systems and requires dealers of certain motor vehicles to provide that 
36 notice to potential owners of motor vehicles, and it provides for an administrative 
37 consequence if a dealer does not comply.23
