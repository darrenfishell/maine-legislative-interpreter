43.  De novo review.  In interpreting a state statute, rule or subregulatory document, a 
5 state court or an officer hearing an administrative action may not defer to an agency's 
6 interpretation of it and shall instead interpret its meaning and effect de novo. In actions 
7 brought by or against agencies, after applying all customary tools of interpretation, the 
8 court or hearing officer shall resolve any remaining doubt in favor of a reasonable 
9 interpretation that limits agency power and maximizes individual liberty.
10Sec. A-2.  5 MRSA §9061, first ¶, as enacted by PL 1977, c. 551, §3, is amended 
11 to read:
12 Every agency decision made at the conclusion of an adjudicatory proceeding shall must 
13 be in writing or stated in the record, and shall must include findings of fact sufficient to 
14 apprise the parties and any interested member of the public of the basis for the decision. A 
15 copy of the decision shall must be delivered or promptly mailed to each party to the 
16 proceeding or his the party's representative of record. Written notice of the party's rights to 
17 review or appeal of the decision within the agency or review of the decision by the courts, 
18 as the case may be, and of the action required and the time within which such action must 
19 be taken in order to exercise the right of review or appeal, shall  must be given to each party 
20 with the decision.  In any review or appeal of a decision to a court of this State, the court 
21 may not defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute, rule or subregulatory document and 
22 shall instead interpret its meaning and effect de novo. After applying all customary tools 
23 of interpretation, the court shall resolve any remaining doubt in favor of a reasonable 
24 interpretation that limits agency power and maximizes individual liberty.
25Sec. A-3.  5 MRSA §11007, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2021, c. 277, §10, is further

30 17106‑B, the court shall review the matter de novo.  The court shall review de novo an 
31 agency's interpretation of a statute, rule or subregulatory document. After applying all

17 Legislature fails to enact legislation authorizing adoption or disapproving adoption of the 
18 rule or part of the rule during the legislative review session or during any subsequent 
19 session to which a legislative instrument expressly providing for approval or disapproval 
20 of the rule or part of the rule is carried over.  Nothing in this section requires the Legislature

17SUMMARY
18 This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing administrative procedures.
19 Part A requires courts and hearing officers to review an agency's interpretation of a 
20 statute, rule or subregulatory document without deference to the agency's interpretation. If 
21 the legal text is unclear after the court or hearing officer exhausts all customary interpretive 
22 tools, the court or hearing officer must default to a reasonable interpretation that limits 
23 agency power and maximizes individual liberty.
24 Part B provides that administrative rules expire on June 30th of the 5th year following 
25 the year of their filing unless extended by the Legislature. It also requires rules to be 
26 approved by the Governor before they can be finally adopted by an agency.
27 Part C changes the definitions of routine technical rules and major substantive rules. It 
28 also eliminates the provision allowing an agency to finally adopt major substantive rules 
29 that the Legislature failed to act on.1
