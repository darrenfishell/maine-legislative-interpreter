Fiscal Detail and Notes Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Currently funded in Biennial Budget (PL 2023, c.17) 
Potential future biennium cost increase -General Fund 
The Legislature already covers and pays for its share of the individual premium for the state employee health 
insurance plan for a session-only employee while the employee remains employed by the Legislature. Funding for 
such coverage was included in the Legislature's baseline biennial budget (PL 2023, c.17). 
Putting this negotiated benefit in statute means that, without future legislation, any potential cost reduction from 
elimination or reduction of the benefit in subsequent negotiations is removed.
