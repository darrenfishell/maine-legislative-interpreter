Page 1 - 131LR1996(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §2124-A, first ¶, as amended by PL 2019, c. 291, Pt. B, §3, is 
3 further amended to read:
4 By January 1, 2021 2024 and biennially annually thereafter, the department shall 
5 submit a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
6 environmental environment and natural resources matters and the Governor setting forth 
7 information on statewide generation of solid waste, statewide recycling rates and available 
8 disposal capacity for solid waste.
9Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §2133, sub-§7, as amended by PL 2019, c. 291, Pt. B, §4, is 
10 further amended to read:
117.  Recycling progress reports.  Municipalities shall report biennially  annually, on 
12 forms provided by the department, on their solid waste management and recycling 
13 practices.  The biennial annual report must identify the options available to residents and 
14 businesses within the municipality for managing solid waste, including any provisions for 
15 the separate management of reportable recyclable materials and organic waste and the 
16 disposal of other municipal solid waste, including construction and demolition debris.  The 
17 department shall assist municipalities in developing and tracking a municipal or regional 
18 recycling rate by developing a municipal waste stream management assessment model.  
19 The model must rely on actual waste data whenever possible, but incorporate default 
20 generation estimates when needed.  Default generation estimates must incorporate factors 
21 such as commercial activity, geographical differences and municipal population.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill requires the Department of Environmental Protection to annually instead of 
24 biennially submit reports to the Legislature and Governor setting forth information on 
25 statewide generation of solid waste, statewide recycling rates and available disposal 
26 capacity for solid waste.  The bill also amends the law requiring municipalities to submit 
27 biennial progress reports to the department on recycling by making that an annual 
28 requirement.23
