10 Handling Fee for Beverage Containers Reimbursed to Dealers and Redemption Centers" 
11 Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the following: 
12 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
13 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
14 Whereas, the State's successful beverage container redemption program protects 
15 public health and safety by preventing litter from polluting water sources and spreading 
16 disease and by reducing air and water contamination caused by the burning of containers 
17 in a waste-to-energy facility or the disposal of containers in a landfill; and 
18 Whereas, Maine residents rely on beverage container redemption centers as a 
19 convenient option for redeeming container refunds, which many residents use to support 
20 their household budgets; and 
21 Whereas, redemption centers are struggling to address increased system costs due to 
22 inflation and other factors, which have forced many redemption centers to reduce hours or 
23 close, while at the same time, recent increased demands for redemption services are 
24 overwhelming redemption centers still in operation; and 
25 Whereas, necessary operational changes to streamline the beverage container 
26 redemption program cannot be implemented in sufficient time to address the current cost 
27 and demand issues overwhelming redemption centers now and in the near future; and 
28 Whereas, an immediate increase in the handling fee paid by initiators of deposit to 
29 redemption centers and an additional future increase in that fee, as provided in this 
30 legislation, are necessary to prevent further redemption center closures; and 
31 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
32 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
33 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
3 4 therefore,'

This bill increases the cost of handling reimbursement paid per returned beverage container paid by the initiator of 
deposit to dealers and local redemption centers by one cent beginning May 1, 2023 and another half-cent beginning 
September 1, 2023. Since the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations (BABLO) functions as the 
initiator of deposit for all spirits sold in Maine, the increase in the reimbursement rates will require an additional 
allocation to the Alcoholic Beverages Fund of $52,959 in fiscal year 2022-23, $450,155 in fiscal year 2023-24 and 
$514,766 in fiscal year 2024-25. Because the bottle redemption program and any payments required by the initiator of 
deposit are included in the spirits administration contract with Pine State Trading Company, this change will require 
the contract to be renegotiated.
