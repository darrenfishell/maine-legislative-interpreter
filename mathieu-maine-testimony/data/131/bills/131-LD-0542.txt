3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill would require the Public Utilities Commission to develop and implement new 
6 rate structures for electric utilities that accomplish the following:
7 1.  Electric distribution utility revenue's no longer being based on kilowatt-hour sales, 
8 removing the threat of lost revenue from reduced consumption because of local generation 
9 or energy efficiency and demand management measures;
10 2.  Replacement of the existing fixed net energy credit system with one that reflects the 
11 value of energy when delivered as well as systemic and societal benefits;
12 3.  Establishment of a standard-offer service with various pricing levels based on the 
13 value of energy consumed at the time of use; and
14 4.  The filing by utilities of multiyear rate plans that provide for an annual review by 
15 the Public Utilities Commission and, based on achievement of commission-approved 
16 performance metrics, including reliability and resiliency, affordability, interconnection 
17 response time and customer service performance, allow the commission to award or 
18 penalize the utilities.4
