5SUMMARY
6 This bill requires a licensing scheme for certain firms, associations, corporations or 
7 nonprofit organizations, including residential care facilities, that provide services to an 
8 adult with an intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, a related condition or an 
9 acquired brain injury and specifies that residential care facilities are not required to use the 
10 standard contract for those services.  The bill replaces the definition of "autism" with a 
11 definition of "autism spectrum disorder" or "autism."  The bill clarifies that the State's share 
12 of MaineCare reimbursements is a factor in determining whether or not certain residential 
13 care facilities must obtain a license.  The bill also expands the services and programs that 
14 the Commissioner of Health and Human Services is authorized to provide and help finance.6
