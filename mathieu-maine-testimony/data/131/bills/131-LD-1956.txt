29 kiosk use has occurred.
30 E. The board is not required to wait until human harm has occurred to initiate an 
31 investigation under this subsection.

35 eye examination under section 19309, may impose an administrative fine of not more 
36 than $10,000 for each violation or attempted violation and may issue an order requiring
