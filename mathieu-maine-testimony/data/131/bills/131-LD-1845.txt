15§3131.  Outdoor lighting
16 This section governs outdoor lighting fixtures. Nothing in this section limits the 
17 application of Title 5, section 1769 or Title 23, section 708 governing the use of state funds 
18 to install or replace outdoor lighting fixtures.
191. Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
20 following terms have the following meanings.
21 A.  "Outdoor lighting fixture" means an outdoor artificial lighting device, whether 
22 temporary, portable or permanently installed, including but not limited to a searchlight, 
23 spotlight, floodlight or other device for lighting a landscape, advertisement, structure, 
24 parking lot or street that uses:
25 (1) One or more incandescent light bulbs that use in total more than 150 watts of 
26 electricity; or
27 (2) Any other lighting device that uses more than 70 watts of electricity.
28 B.  "Mercury vapor lamp" has the same meaning as in 10 Code of Federal Regulations, 
29 Section 431.282 (2009).
30 C.  "Place" means, with respect to a temporary or portable outdoor lighting fixture, to 
31 place and use outside.
32 D. "Replace" means, with respect to an outdoor lighting fixture, to replace an outdoor 
33 lighting fixture that is nonfunctional with a new outdoor lighting fixture. 
34 E. "Shielded" means, with respect to an outdoor lighting fixture, that a shield or other 
35 device has been placed on the fixture that ensures that light emitted from the fixture is 
36 projected below a horizontal plane running through a point immediately above the 
37 emitting light, as specified by the department by rule.
Page 2 - 131LR1986(01)12. Prohibition.  Beginning January 1, 2024, except as provided in subsection 3, a 
2 person may not:
3 A. Place or install an outdoor lighting fixture unless the fixture is shielded or replace 
4 an outdoor lighting fixture unless the replacement is shielded;
5 B.  Illuminate an outdoor lighting fixture between 11 p.m. and sunrise unless the fixture 
6 is shielded; or
7 C. Place or install an outdoor lighting fixture that uses a mercury vapor lamp or replace 
8 an outdoor lighting fixture with one that uses a mercury vapor lamp. 
93. Exemptions.  The following are exempt from the requirements of subsection 2:
10 A. An outdoor lighting fixture used to illuminate signs on the Maine Turnpike or an 
11 interstate highway as defined in Title 23, section 1903, subsection 3;
12 B. An outdoor lighting fixture used at an airport or otherwise necessary for aircraft 
13 safety, as determined by the department by rule; and
14 C.  An outdoor lighting fixture used at a farm for the safety of agricultural labor as 
15 defined in Title 26, section 1043, subsection 1.
164. Ratemaking; public utilities.  A public utility regulated by the Public Utilities 
17 Commission under Title 35-A that prudently incurs costs to comply with the requirements 
18 of subsection 2 or an ordinance described in subsection 5 is entitled to recover those costs 
19 in rates.
205. Application; enforcement.  This subsection governs the application and 
21 enforcement of this section.
22 A. The provisions of subsection 2 do not apply in a municipality that has adopted an 
23 ordinance that includes the requirements of subsection 2 or requirements stricter than 
24 those in subsection 2.   The ordinance must include the exemptions specified in 
25 subsection 3 and no other exemptions.  A municipality that has adopted such an 
26 ordinance shall notify the department and provide to the department an electronic link 
27 to the ordinance.  The department shall post on its publicly accessible website a link to 
28 each such ordinance.  This paragraph places express limitations on municipal home 
29 rule authority.
30 B. The department shall enforce the requirements of this section in any area of the State 
31 not governed by an ordinance described in paragraph A. 
326. Violations.  Whenever it appears, after investigation, that there is or has been a 
33 violation of subsection 2,  the commissioner may, after holding an enforcement hearing in 
34 accordance with section 347-A, subsection 2:
35 A. For a first violation, issue to the violator an order to take such action as is necessary 
36 for the violator to come into compliance, including but not limited to ceasing use of an 
37 outdoor lighting fixture in violation of subsection 2 or replacing an outdoor lighting 
38 fixture with one that complies with subsection 2; and
39 B. If the commissioner finds that an order issued under paragraph A has not been 
40 complied with after 30 days, or finds that the violator has committed another violation 
41 of this section, assess the violator an administrative penalty not to exceed $25 for each 
42 outdoor lighting fixture that is the subject of the violation.  The commissioner shall 
Page 3 - 131LR1986(01)43 reduce the penalty, but not below $0, by any cost the commissioner finds the violator 
44 incurs to replace an outdoor lighting fixture with one that complies with this section.
3SUMMARY
4 This bill regulates outdoor lighting fixtures.  Beginning January 1, 2024, it imposes, 
5 with some exceptions, certain requirements related to the installation and use of outdoor 
6 lighting fixtures.  It prohibits a person from placing or installing an outdoor lighting fixture 
7 unless the fixture is shielded to direct the light downward.  It provides that if an outdoor 
8 lighting fixture is not shielded it may not be operated between 11 p.m. and sunrise.  It 
9 prohibits the installation of outdoor lighting fixtures that use a mercury vapor lamp.  These 
10 provisions apply in the absence of a municipal ordinance that provides the same or more 
11 restrictive requirements.  Where there is no such ordinance, the Department of 
12 Environmental Protection has authority to enforce the requirements.  It also requires 
13 outdoor luminaires for buildings owned or leased by the State to be consistent with certain 
14 standards established by the Illuminating Engineering Society.1
