The bill requires the State Employee Health Plan to reduce from $3,500 to $1,500 per year the maximum out-ofÂ­
pocket limit for prescription drugs subject to coinsurance. It is expected that the increase in the out-of-pocket limit 
take effect on or after July 1, 2024. The total cost to the plan is estimated to be $26,381 in fiscal year 2024-25. The 
bill includes General Fund appropriations of $11,911 in fiscal year 2024-25 and Highway Fund allocations of $4,396 
in fiscal year 2024-25 to state departments and agencies that pay premiums to the health plan to cover the increased 
costs for those two funds. The remaining costs of $10,075 in fiscal year 2024-25 will be distributed across multiple 
funds across state government.
