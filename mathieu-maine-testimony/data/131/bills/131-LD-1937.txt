Page 1 - 131LR2549(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, records provided by railroad companies describing hazardous materials 
4 transported in the State, the routes of hazardous materials shipments and the frequency of 
5 hazardous materials operations on those routes that are in the possession of a state or local 
6 emergency management entity or law enforcement agency, fire department or other first 
7 responder are not subject to public disclosure; and
8Whereas, this legislation makes those records subject to public disclosure; and
9Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day 
10 period because the potential for discharge of hazardous materials transported by a railroad 
11 company poses a threat to public health, safety and welfare; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15 therefore,
16Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17Sec. 1.  1 MRSA §402, sub-§3, ¶T, as amended by PL 2017, c. 118, §1, is further 
18 amended to read:
19 T.  Records describing research for the development of processing techniques for 
20 fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing or the design and operation of a 
21 depuration plant in the possession of the Department of Marine Resources; and
22Sec. 2.  1 MRSA §402, sub-§3, ¶U, as amended by PL 2019, c. 667, Pt. B, §4, is 
23 repealed.
24Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
25 takes effect when approved.
