Fiscal Detail and Notes
Under this bill deposits or refunds owed to a member of a rural electrification cooperative, defined by the bill as 
abandoned capital credits, would no longer be transferred to  the Unclaimed Property Fund (fund) administered by the 
State Treasurer. Money in this fund is transferred to the Gene ral Fund at the end of each fiscal year after an effort is 
made to find the rightful owner of the money. No longer  transferring these credits to the fund will reduce General 
Fund revenue. Instead, this bill directs any abandoned capital cr edits that remain unclaimed one year after becoming 
payable be used to provide assistance to low-inco me households. Currently, the Public Utilities Commission 
coordinates with the Maine State Housing Authority (MS HA) to administer existing PUC low-income assistance 
programs. The PUC anticipates that any new revenues from abandoned capital credits will be transferred to the MSHA and expended within existing low-income assistance programs.Fiscal Note Re quired: Yes
