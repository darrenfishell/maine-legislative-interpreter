13SUMMARY
14 This resolve directs the Department of Health and Human Services to seek approval 
15 from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare 
16 and Medicaid Services to amend the brain injury waiver, rule Chapter 101: MaineCare 
17 Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 18, Allowances for Home and Community-Based 
18 Services for Adults with Brain Injury, to increase Home Support (Residential Habilitation) 
19 Level I rates for services provided to MaineCare members by an amount in the same 
20 proportion as the difference between the Chained Consumer Price Index on the date the 
21 rate was last adjusted and the Chained Consumer Price Index on the effective date of this 
22 resolve. It requires the increase in reimbursement to go to direct support employees. It also 
23 allows up to 400 units of care coordination each year rather than only in the first year of 
24 receiving services under the waiver. The Department of Health and Human Services is 
25 directed to explore opportunities to provide additional telehealth services, including care 
26 coordination services, provided by both licensed medical personnel and nonlicensed 
27 personnel.1
