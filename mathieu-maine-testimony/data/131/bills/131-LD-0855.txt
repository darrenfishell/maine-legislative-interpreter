Page 1 - 131LR1555(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§1, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Minimum wage.  The minimum hourly wage is $7.50 per hour.  Starting January 
5 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2018, the 
6 minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, the minimum hourly 
7 wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum hourly wage is $12.00 
8 per hour.  On January 1, 2021 and each January 1st thereafter until January 1, 2026, the 
9 minimum hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost 
10 of living. The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, 
11 if any, as of August of the previous year over the level as of August of the year preceding 
12 that year in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, 
13 CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the United States 
14 Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount 
15 of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.  On January 1, 2026 
16 and each January 1st thereafter, the minimum hourly wage then in effect must be increased 
17 by the average increase, if any, in the cost of living over the 3 previous years. The average 
18 increase in the cost of living over the 3 previous years must be measured using the 
19 percentage increase, if any, as of August of each year over the level as of August of the 
20 year preceding that year in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical 
21 Workers, CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the 
22 United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with 
23 the amount of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.  If the 
24 highest federal minimum wage is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect under 
25 this section, the minimum wage under this section is increased to the same amount, 
26 effective on the same date as the increase in the federal minimum wage, and must be 
27 increased in accordance with this section thereafter.
28SUMMARY
29 This bill provides that, beginning in 2026, the minimum wage increases by the average 
30 increase, if any, in the cost of living over the 3 previous calendar years.29
