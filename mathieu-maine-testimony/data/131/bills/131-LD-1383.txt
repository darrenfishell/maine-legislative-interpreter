Page 1 - 131LR0694(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §4304, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2007, c. 199, Pt. B, §13, is 
3 further amended to read:
41.  Requirements for medical review or utilization review practices.  A carrier must 
5 shall appoint a medical director who is responsible for reviewing and approving the carrier's 
6 policies governing the clinical aspects of coverage determinations by any health plan that 
7 it offers or renews.  A carrier's medical review or utilization review practices must be 
8 governed by the standard of medically necessary health care as defined in this chapter.  A 
9 carrier shall provide clear written policies and procedures to providers and insureds on how 
10 to obtain a prior authorization.
11Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §4304-A is enacted to read:
12§4304-A.  Prior authorization for physical therapy, occupational therapy, 
13chiropractic services and physical medicine or rehabilitation
14 This section governs prior authorization for physical therapy, occupational therapy and 
15 physical medicine or rehabilitation.
161. Prior authorization for new episode of care prohibited for 12 visits.  A carrier 
17 may not require prior authorization for rehabilitative or habilitative services, including, but 
18 not limited to, physical therapy, occupational therapy services or chiropractic services for 
19 the first 12 visits of each new episode of care.  For purposes of this subsection, "new 
20 episode of care" means treatment for a new or recurring condition for which an insured has 
21 not been treated by the provider within the previous 90 days.  After the 12 visits of each 
22 new episode of care, a carrier may not require prior authorization more frequently than 
23 every 6 visits or every 30 days, whichever time period is longer.
242. Prior authorization for chronic pain prohibited for 90 days.  A carrier may not 
25 require prior authorization for physical medicine or rehabilitation services provided to 
26 patients with chronic pain for the first 90 days following diagnosis in order to provide the 
27 necessary nonpharmacologic management of the pain.  After the first 90 days following a 
28 chronic pain diagnosis, a carrier may not require prior authorization more frequently than 
29 every 6 visits or every 30 days, whichever time period is longer.  For purposes of this 
30 subsection, "chronic pain" means pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months.
313. Response time; additional information. A carrier shall respond to a prior 
32 authorization request for services or visits in an ongoing plan of care under this section 
33 within 24 hours.  If a carrier requires more information to make a decision on the prior 
34 authorization request, the carrier shall notify the patient and the provider within 24 hours 
35 of the initial request with the information that is needed to complete the prior authorization 
36 request, including but not limited to the specific tests and measures needed from the patient 
37 and provider.  A carrier shall make a decision on the prior authorization request within 24 
38 hours of receiving the requested information.
394. Approval of prior authorization.  This subsection governs circumstances in which 
40 a prior authorization for covered services under this section is deemed to be approved by a 
41 carrier.  A prior authorization is deemed to be approved if a carrier:
42 A. Fails to timely answer a prior authorization request in accordance with subsection 
43 3, including due to a failure of the carrier's prior authorization platform or process; or
Page 2 - 131LR0694(01)1 B. Informs a provider that prior authorization is not required orally, via an online 
2 platform or program, through the patient's health plan documents or by any other 
3 means.
45. Retroactive authorization.  A carrier shall provide a procedure for providers and 
5 insureds to obtain retroactive authorization for services under this section that are medically 
6 necessary covered benefits.  A carrier may not deny coverage for medically necessary 
7 services under this section only for failure to obtain a prior authorization, if a medical 
8 necessity determination can be made after the services have been provided and the services 
9 would have been covered benefits if prior authorization had been obtained.
106. Appeal.  A carrier's failure to approve a prior authorization for all services or visits 
11 in a plan of care under this section is subject to the same appeal rights as a denial under the 
12 bureau's rule regarding health plan accountability and the provider's network agreement 
13 with the carrier, if any.
147. Intent.  Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit a carrier from performing a 
15 retrospective medical necessity review.

17 This bill enacts provisions of law relating to prior authorization for physical therapy, 
18 occupational therapy, chiropractic services and physical medicine and rehabilitation
