18 F.  "Price applicability period" means the period of time defined in United States Public 
19 Law 117-169, Section 1191 (2022).
20 G. "Referenced drugs" means prescription drugs subject to a referenced rate. 
21 H.  "Referenced rate" means the maximum rate for a prescription drug published by 
22 the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant 
23 to United States Public Law 117-169, Section 1195 (2022).
24 I.  "State entity" means any agency of State Government that purchases prescription 
25 drugs on behalf of the State for a person whose health care is paid for by the State, 
26 including any agent, vendor, fiscal agent, contractor or other party acting on behalf of 
27 the State.  "State entity" does not include the medical assistance program established 
28 under 42 United States Code, Section 1396 et seq.
292.  Payment in excess of referenced rate prohibited.  The following practices are 
30 prohibited.
31 A. It is a violation of this section to dispense, deliver or administer to a consumer in 
32 the State in person, by mail or by another means a prescription drug for a cost that 
33 exceeds the referenced rate during the price applicability period. 
34 B.  It is a violation of this section for a state entity, carrier offering a health plan or 
35 participating ERISA plan sponsor to purchase referenced drugs or seek reimbursement 
36 for referenced drugs to be dispensed or delivered to a consumer in the State, whether 
37 directly or through a distributor, for a cost higher than the referenced rate. Contracts

6 ERISA plan at a cost that exceeds the referenced rate. The referenced rate does not 
7 include a dispensing fee paid to a retail pharmacy, and this chapter may not be 
8 construed to prevent a retail pharmacy from receiving a dispensing fee above the 
9 referenced rate. 
103. ERISA plan sponsor participation.  An ERISA plan sponsor may elect to 
11 participate in the provisions of this section. An ERISA plan sponsor that elects to

144. Rules.  The Superintendent of Insurance may adopt rules to carry out the purposes 
15 of this subchapter. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules 
16 under Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
175.  Registered agent and office within the State.  An entity that sells, distributes, 
18 delivers or offers for sale any prescription drug in the State shall maintain a registered agent 
19 and office within the State.
206.  Use of savings.  The following provisions govern the use of savings generated as a 
21 result of the requirements in subsection 2.
22 A.  Any savings generated as a result of the requirements in subsection 2 during the 
23 price applicability period must be used to reduce costs to consumers. A state entity, 
24 carrier or participating ERISA plan sponsor shall calculate its savings and use the 
25 savings directly to reduce costs for its members. In determining how to use savings in 
26 order to comply with this subsection, a state entity, carrier or participating ERISA plan 
27 sponsor shall consider strategies that promote greater health equity by addressing 
28 health disparities across communities. 
29 B.  No later than April 1st of each calendar year, each state entity, carrier or 
30 participating ERISA plan sponsor subject to this section shall submit to the 
31 Superintendent of Insurance a report describing the savings achieved for each 
32 referenced drug for the previous calendar year and how those savings were used to 
33 achieve the requirements under paragraph A, including if the savings were used to 
34 promote greater health equity by addressing health disparities across communities. 
35 C. The Superintendent of Insurance shall adopt and implement rules setting forth the 
36 method for calculating savings and the format and manner for submitting the report 
37 under paragraph B.
387.  Enforcement.  Each violation of this section is subject to a fine of $1,000. Each 
39 individual transaction in violation of subsection 2 is a separate violation.  The Attorney 
40 General is authorized to enforce the provisions of this section on behalf of any state entity 
41 or consumer of prescription drugs. The refusal of a manufacturer or distributor of 
42 prescription drugs to negotiate in good faith as described in subsection 8 is a valid 
43 affirmative defense in any enforcement action brought under this subchapter. 1

Page 3 - 131LR0735(01)18.  Prohibition on withdrawal of referenced drugs for sale.  The following 
2 provisions govern the withdrawal of a referenced drug.
3 A.  A manufacturer or distributor of a referenced drug may not withdraw that drug from 
4 sale or distribution within the State for the purpose of avoiding the effect of the rate 
5 limitations set forth in subsection 2.
6 B.  A manufacturer that intends to withdraw a referenced drug from sale or distribution 
7 from within the State shall provide a notice of withdrawal in writing to the 
8 Superintendent of Insurance and to the Attorney General at least 180 days prior to the 
9 withdrawal.
10 C. A manufacturer or distributor of a referenced drug may not refuse to negotiate in 
11 good faith with a payor or seller of prescription drugs a price that does not exceed the 
12 referenced rate for that drug. 
13 D.  The Superintendent of Insurance shall assess a penalty of $500,000 or the amount 
14 of annual savings determined by the superintendent in accordance with subsection 6, 
15 whichever is greater, on any manufacturer or distributor of a referenced drug, that the 
16 superintendent determines has withdrawn a referenced drug from sale or distribution 
17 in the State in violation of paragraph A or B or has failed to negotiate in good faith in 
18 violation of paragraph C.
19Sec. 2.  Purpose; legislative findings.  The purpose of this Act is to protect the 
20 safety, health and economic well-being of the people of this State by safeguarding them 
21 from the negative and harmful effects of excessive and unconscionable prices for 
22 prescription drugs. The Legislature finds that:
23 1.  Access to prescription drugs is necessary for the people of this State to maintain or 
24 acquire good health;
25 2.  Excessive prices negatively affect the ability of the people of this State to obtain 
26 prescription drugs, and price increases that exceed reasonable levels endanger the health 
27 and safety of the people of this State;
28 3.  Excessive prices for prescription drugs threaten the economic well-being of the 
29 people of this State and endanger their ability to pay for other necessary and essential goods 
30 and services, including housing, food and utilities;
31 4.  Excessive prices for prescription drugs contribute significantly to a dramatic and 
32 unsustainable rise in health care costs and health insurance costs and threaten the overall 
33 ability of the people of this State to obtain health insurance coverage and maintain or 
34 acquire good health; and
35 5.  Excessive prices for prescription drugs contribute significantly to rising costs to the 
36 State for health care provided and paid for through health insurance programs for public 
37 employees, including employees of the State, municipalities and counties, school districts, 
38 institutions of higher education and retirees whose health care costs are funded by public 
39 programs, thereby threatening the ability of the State to fund those programs adequately 
40 and further threatening the ability of the State to fund other programs necessary for the 
41 public good and safety, such as public education and public safety.
42 Based on findings in subsections 1 to 5, the Legislature finds that excessive prices for 
43 prescription drugs threaten the safety and well-being of the people of this State and finds it 
Page 4 - 131LR0735(01)44 necessary to act in order to protect the people of this State from the negative effects of 
45 excessive costs.
3SUMMARY
4 This bill requires that a state entity, health plan or participating plan qualified under 
5 the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 may not purchase 
6 prescription drugs to be dispensed or delivered to a consumer of this State at a cost that 
7 exceeds the referenced rate.  The referenced rate of a prescription drug is the maximum 
8 rate for a drug determined by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and 
9 Human Services under the federal Medicare program. Any savings generated as a result 
10 must be used to reduce costs to consumers.1
