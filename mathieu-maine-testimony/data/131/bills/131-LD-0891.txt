Page 1 - 131LR1284(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  5 MRSA ยง7073 is enacted to read:
3ยง7073.  Due process in suspension without pay or termination
41. Written notice.  A state agency may not suspend without pay or dismiss an 
5 employee of that agency unless the agency has given the employee written notice of the 
6 action to be taken and the reasons for such action at least 3 business days prior to the 
7 suspension without pay or dismissal. The notice must inform the employee of the 
8 employee's right to meet with the agency, or its representative, prior to the suspension or 
9 dismissal action and to have an agent, representative or other person present at the meeting. 
10 For purposes of this section, "state agency" means a state department, agency, office, board 
11 or commission or a quasi-independent agency, board, commission, authority or institution.
122. Meeting request.  An employee who received written notice pursuant to subsection 
13 1 may, within 5 business days of receiving the notice,  request to meet with the state agency 
14 issuing the notice.  If the employee requests the meeting prior to or on the effective date of 
15 the proposed suspension without pay or dismissal, the effective date of the suspension or 
16 dismissal is delayed until the date the agency meets with the employee.  If the employee 
17 requests a meeting after the effective date of the suspension without pay or dismissal, the 
18 agency shall schedule a meeting with the employee to occur within 2 business days of the 
19 request.
203.  Meeting.  At the meeting between the employee and the state agency, or its 
21 representative, the agency shall provide the employee with the reason for the suspension 
22 without pay or dismissal and the evidence supporting the suspension without pay or 
23 dismissal.  The agency shall give the employee and the employee's agent or representative 
24 an opportunity to respond.
254. Exception.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a state agency may 
26 immediately suspend without pay or dismiss an employee in instances of gross misconduct 
27 or where the employee's continued presence on the job represents a potential danger to 
28 persons or property or would severely interfere with the operations or security of the 
29 agency.
