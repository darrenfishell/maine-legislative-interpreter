33§6207.  Acquisition criteria
341.  Distribution of funds.  The board shall authorize the distribution of funds from the 
35 Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund , the Conservation and Recreation Fund and the Public 
36 Access to Maine Waters Fund to state agencies and cooperating entities for the acquisition 
37 of natural lands that meet the criteria set forth in this chapter.
382.  Determination of statewide significance.  In determining whether a proposed 
39 acquisition must be funded, in full or in part, by the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund , 
40 the Conservation and Recreation Fund or the Public Access to Maine Waters Fund, the 
41 board shall consider whether the site is of statewide significance and:
42 A.  Contains recreation lands, prime physical features of the Maine landscape, areas of 
43 special scenic beauty, farmland or open space, undeveloped shorelines, significant 
Page 6 - 131LR2547(01)44 undeveloped archeological sites, wetlands, fragile mountain areas or lands with other 
45 conservation, wilderness or recreation values;
3 B.  Is habitat for plant or animal species or natural communities considered rare, 
4 threatened or endangered in the State;
5 C.  Provides nonmotorized or motorized public access to recreation opportunities or 
6 those natural resources identified in this section;
7 D.  Provides public water supply protection when that purpose is consistent and does 
8 not conflict with the natural resource conservation and recreation purposes of this 
9 chapter; or
10 E.  Contains deer wintering areas and satisfies all the requirements of subsection 3, 
11 paragraph A.
123.  Priorities.   Whenever possible, the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund , the 
13 Conservation and Recreation Fund and the Public Access to Maine Waters Fund must be 
14 used for land acquisition projects when matching funds are available from cooperating 
15 entities, as long as the proposed acquisition meets all other criteria set forth in this chapter.  
16 For acquisitions funded by the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund  and the Conservation 
17 and Recreation Fund, the board shall give priority to projects that conserve lands with 
18 multiple outstanding resource or recreation values or a single exceptional value, that help 
19 the State's natural ecosystems, wildlife and natural resource-based economies adapt to a 
20 changing climate, that provide geographic representation and that build upon or connect 
21 existing holdings.
22 A.  When evaluating projects to be funded, the board shall give a preferential 
23 consideration to projects that conserve lands that have been determined by the 
24 Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to be important for conserving deer in 
25 northern, eastern and western Maine.  To be given preferential consideration under this 
26 paragraph, a project must result in the acquisition of a fee interest or an easement 
27 interest in the land, the department's holding the interest in the land and the 
28 department's managing the land area as a wildlife management area, as defined in Title 
29 12, section 10001, subsection 74, with deer conservation as the highest management 
30 priority.  Only projects that satisfy the requirements of this paragraph may be given 
31 preferential consideration.  Nothing in this paragraph limits the ability of the board to 
32 use the Land for Maine’s Future Trust Fund  or the Conservation and Recreation Fund 
33 to fund other projects that may also help conserve deer or deer habitat but that do not 
34 receive preferential consideration under this paragraph.
35 When acquiring land or interest in land, the board shall examine public vehicular access 
36 rights to the land and, whenever possible and appropriate, acquire guaranteed public 
37 vehicular access as part of the acquisition.
384.  Nonqualifying expenditures.  The board may not fund:
39 A.  Facilities for organized recreational activities, including, but not limited to, 
40 ballparks, tennis courts or playgrounds;

42 subsection 3, paragraph B, section 6203-D, subsection 2 and section 6203-E,

Page 7 - 131LR2547(01)1 C.  The acquisition of land of which the primary use value has been and will be as

4 project under this chapter, a person submitting a proposal to acquire property or an interest 
5 in property with funding from the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund , the Conservation 
6 and Recreation Fund or the Public Access to Maine Waters Fund shall provide:
7 A.  A description of the management envisioned for the property for the first 10 years 
8 following acquisition. When the application proposes acquiring an interest in property, 
9 the application must provide a description of the anticipated management 
10 responsibilities retained by the landowner and those to be assumed by the State or a 
11 cooperating entity;
12 B.  Preliminary estimates of the costs to the State or a cooperating entity of managing 
13 the land for the uses proposed in the application; and
14 C.  Preliminary estimates of the costs associated with monitoring compliance with an 
15 easement when an interest in land is acquired.
166.  Public uses.  Hunting, fishing, trapping and public access may not be prohibited on 
17 land acquired with proceeds from the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund  or the 
18 Conservation and Recreation Fund, except to the extent prohibited by applicable state, local 
19 or federal laws, rules and regulations and except for working waterfront projects and

34 exemplary natural communities, features of historic significance and other high priority 
35 natural features and ecologic functions as determined by the board, with reference to the 
36 best inventory data available to the State. Subsequent management by state agencies

38 objective of maintaining and protecting those features and functions.

46 the assets of the account.  Any balance remaining in the account at the end of any fiscal 
47 year must be carried forward to the next fiscal year.  Notwithstanding section 6203  6203-D, 
48 subsection 3  2, the board may expend funds deposited in the account pursuant to this section 
49 to cover administrative costs and for staff support and consulting services, as determined 
50 necessary by the board to carry out its duties under this chapter.
