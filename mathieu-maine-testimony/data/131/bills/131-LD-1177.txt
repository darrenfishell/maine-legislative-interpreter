15 D.  "Slip" means a dock, mooring, finger float, pier or any other marine infrastructure 
16 that allows for vessels to securely stay for a period of longer than 8 hours.
172. Slip fee.  Notwithstanding any provision in a local ordinance that imposes a mooring 
18 fee on domestic watercraft in a municipal harbor, a municipality that pursuant to such an 
19 ordinance imposes mooring fees shall require a megayacht that is registered in an overseas 
20 tax haven to pay a fee of $10 per foot of length over 100 feet for each day that the 
21 megayacht is secured to a slip in that municipality's harbor. The municipality retains 10% 
22 of all fees collected pursuant to this subsection and shall quarterly transmit the remainder 
23 of those fees to the Treasurer of State for deposit in the fund established in subsection 3.
243. Megayacht Fund established. The Megayacht Fund is established to receive slip 
25 fees assessed and collected under subsection 2. The Treasurer of State shall quarterly 
26 disburse the funds within the fund as follows:
27 A. Fifty percent of funds must be disbursed to the Maine State Housing Authority for

36 of $10 per foot per day that the megayacht is secured to a slip in a municipal harbor.  The 
37 first 100 feet of overall length of the megayacht are excluded from the calculation of the 
38 total fee.  The fee is collected by the municipality that has jurisdiction over the waters in 
39 which the megayacht is secured, and that municipality retains 10% of the fee collected.  
40 The bill also establishes the Megayacht Fund, into which the remaining 90% of the fee is 
41 deposited.  The Treasurer of State disburses 50% of the Megayacht Fund to the Maine State 35
