Page 1 - 131LR0996(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  23 MRSA §73, sub-§7, as amended by PL 2021, c. 239, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
47.  Priorities, service levels, asset management goals and reporting.  The 
5 Department of Transportation shall classify the State's public highways as Priority 1 to 
6 Priority 5 using factors such as safety metrics, crash data, the federal functional 
7 classification system, local economic significance based on a value per acre analysis, 
8 regional economic significance, heavy haul truck use and relative regional traffic volumes.  
9 The department shall also establish customer service levels related to safety, condition and 
10 serviceability appropriate to the priority of the highway, resulting in a system that grades 
11 each highway as Good, Fair or Poor.
12 To provide a capital transportation program that is geographically balanced and that 
13 addresses urban and rural needs and meets customer expectations and transportation system 
14 needs, the department shall include the following goals as part of its asset management and 
15 work plan preparation.  The goals are to:
16 A-1.  Maintain Priority 1 highways in accordance with the department's federally 
17 required transportation asset management plan and the department's customer service 
18 measures so that no more than 15% of the highways are rated as Poor;
19 B-1.  Maintain Priority 2 and Priority 3 highways so that no more than 15% of the 
20 highways are rated as Poor; and
21 D.  Continue the light capital paving program on a 7-year cycle for Priority 4 highways 
22 outside compact areas as defined in section 754.
23 The department shall report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
24 jurisdiction over transportation matters by March 1st of each odd-numbered year 
25 quantifying the status of each of the goals.  The department shall recommend any remedial 
26 actions, including additional funding or revisions to the goals, that the department 
27 determines to be necessary or appropriate.
28Sec. 2.  23 MRSA §76 is enacted to read:
29§76.  Transportation construction project review and design criteria
301. Project review. As part of a permit application for a transportation construction 
31 project or upon reaching 25% completion of the design of a transportation construction 
32 project, the department shall review the design of the project based upon the controlling 
33 criteria in subsection 2.
342. Controlling criteria. The department shall apply design standards for the following 
35 controlling criteria to a transportation construction project under subsection 1: 
36 A. Pedestrian facilities;
37 B. Bicycle facilities;
38 C. Design speed;
39 D. Shoulder width;
40 E. Lane width;
Page 2 - 131LR0996(01)1 F. Public transit provisions;
2 G. Roadway ramp length;
3 H. Design loading structural capacity;
4 I. Horizontal curve radius;
5 J. Superelevation rate. For purposes of this paragraph, "superelevation" means the bank 
6 of a curved portion of a road that allows fast-moving vehicles to travel the curve safely 
7 and with stability;
8 K. Stopping sight distance;
9 L. Maximum grade;
10 M. Cross slope; and
11 N. Vertical clearance. 
123. Review process. Upon receipt of a design submission for a transportation 
13 construction project, the project manager of the department shall forward a copy of the 
14 design to the chair of the design review committee under subsection 4 and internal design 
15 reviewers in the department for review and approval. The design may require further 
16 approval by the Commissioner of Transportation, the chief engineer of the department and 
17 the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. If the 
18 design meets all applicable design standards for the controlling criteria under subsection 2, 
19 department staff may review and approve the design as a normal part of the project delivery 
20 process. If the design does not meet an applicable design standard for a controlling 
21 criterion, the design must be approved by the chief engineer of the department.
224. Design review committee. The design review committee with respect to a 
23 transportation construction project design submitted under subsection 3 consists of the 
24 department regional manager overseeing the project and the following 6 members 
25 appointed by the Commissioner of Transportation:
26 A. Two urban designers;
27 B. One municipal economic development director;
28 C. Two staff members of the department’s planning bureau; and
29 D. One bicycle or pedestrian safety advocate representing a statewide organization that 
30 represents or advocates for bicycle or pedestrian safety.
31 The regional manager is the chair of the committee.  The design review committee shall 
32 review and approve project designs submitted under subsection 3 and provide 
33 recommendations for design standards for controlling criteria under subsection 2.
345. Exemptions. Upon application to the department, a person that submits a 
35 transportation construction project design under subsection 3 may receive an exemption 
36 from a design standard under subsection 2. The exemption must be based upon a 
37 documented need for a variance despite all reasonable efforts to design the project under 
38 the standard. A cost related to a standard that is less than 20% of the total project cost may 
39 not be the sole cause for an exemption under this subsection. The following projects are 
40 exempt from the standards under this section without requiring an application for an 
41 exemption under this subsection:
Page 3 - 131LR0996(01)1 A. Pavement preservation activities solely to maintain the roadway surface or bridge 
2 structure, as long as the accident history of the location does not indicate any apparent 
3 geometric deficiency, including:
4 (1) Crack sealing;
5 (2) Fog sealing;
6 (3) Chip sealing; and
7 (4) Rubber chip sealing;
8 B. Bridge preservation or maintenance treatments solely to maintain the roadway 
9 surface or bridge structure, as long as the accident history of the location does not 
10 indicate any apparent geometric deficiency, including:
11 (1) Joint repair;
12 (2) Deck repair;
13 (3) Superstructure repair; and 
14 (4) Substructure repair;

31 375, subchapter 2-A.
32Sec. 3.  Department of Transportation to adopt rules to establish standards 
33for transportation construction project review and design criteria. The 
34 Department of Transportation shall adopt rules to establish standards for transportation 
35 construction project review and design criteria under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, 
36 section 76, subsection 2 and otherwise carry out the purposes of Title 23, section 76.

Page 6 - 131LR0996(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill concerns safe roadway construction design criteria and does the following.
3 1. It adds safety metrics, crash data and local economic significance based on a value 
4 per acre analysis as factors in the Department of Transportation classification of state 
5 highway priority levels.
6 2. It establishes transportation construction project design controlling criteria subject 
7 to Department of Transportation review and establishes a review process, including a 
8 review committee, and exemptions. The bill directs the Department of Transportation to 
9 establish by rule standards for the controlling criteria based upon certain publications of 
10 the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the National 
11 Association of City Transportation Officials, the United States Department of Justice, the 
12 United States Department of Transportation and the Massachusetts Highway Department.
13 3. It provides specific direction to the Department of Transportation in adopting by rule 
14 standards for pedestrian facilities, which include sidewalks, shared-use paths and side 
15 paths, and bicycle facilities, which include shared-use paths, side paths, physically 
16 separated bicycle lanes and buffered bicycle lanes.2
