6 amended to read:
73.  Rebate program established; eligibility.  In accordance with the provisions of this 
8 section, the trust shall establish and administer a program that provides rebates for the 
9 purchase or lease of electric vehicles.  A person may apply for and, as resources within the 
10 fund allow, receive a rebate for an electric vehicle, subject to eligibility requirements 
11 established by the trust.  Eligibility criteria for the vehicle must include that the vehicle is: 
12 an electric bicycle, a battery electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle; purchased, 
13 or leased from its original equipment manufacturer or an authorized licensee of the original 
14 equipment manufacturer or a licensed automobile dealer for a term of 36 months or more, 
15 in the State; and registered in the State if required by Title 29-A, except that a vehicle is 
16 not eligible if it has a gross vehicle weight rating of 6,000 pounds or less, is not a truck or 
17 an off-road vehicle and has a manufacturer's suggested retail price greater than $50,000.  
18 To the extent funds are available, the trust may extend program eligibility to medium duty 
19 vehicles and heavy duty vehicles that are battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric 
20 vehicles.  Eligibility requirements for the recipient of the rebate must include that the 
21 recipient attests to a commitment to retain ownership, whether through purchase or lease, 
22 of the eligible electric vehicle for at least 36 months from the date of purchase or lease.  
23 The trust may require a recipient of a rebate under this section who does not retain 
24 ownership of the eligible electric vehicle for at least 36 months to repay the trust up to the 
25 full amount of the rebate.
26 The trust shall establish the rebate amount for each eligible electric vehicle. The trust shall 
27 establish rebate amounts that it determines most effectively increase the purchase of 
28 eligible electric vehicles.  For each model of an eligible electric vehicle, the trust may 
29 establish different rebate amounts based on the size of the vehicle battery.  The trust may 
30 establish different rebate amounts for the purpose of providing reasonable opportunity for 
31 participation in the program across different customer groups and geographic areas.  The 
32 trust may establish reasonable limits on the number of rebates per vehicle or per person.
