Page 1 - 131LR0405(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §1005 is enacted to read:
3§1005.  Recall of school board members
41.  Grounds for recall.  Notwithstanding any provision of law or municipal charter to 
5 the contrary, a school board member may not be recalled unless the school board member:
6 A.  While acting as a school board member, has behaved in a manner that relates to and 
7 adversely affects the administration of the school board member’s office and the rights 
8 and interests of the public;
9 B.  Has committed an act of misconduct in office;
10 C.  Has failed to perform duties prescribed by law; or
11 D.  Has willfully misused, converted or misappropriated, without authority, public 
12 property or public funds entrusted to or associated with the school board.
13 A school board member’s discretionary performance of a lawful act or a prescribed duty is 
14 not a ground for recall.
152.  Procedure.  For a school board member to be recalled from a school board, 25% of 
16 voters in the municipality in which the member was elected or, if the member was elected 
17 at large, 25% of the voters in the school administrative unit who voted at the last 
18 gubernatorial election must sign a petition to recall the member from the school board. The 
19 recall must be approved by a majority of voters in an election in which the total vote is at 
20 least 25% of the number of votes cast in the municipality or, if the member was elected at 
21 large, 25% of the number of votes cast in the school administrative unit in the last 
22 gubernatorial election.
23Sec. 2.  30-A MRSA §2505, first ¶, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 324, §1, is amended 
24 to read:
25 Except as otherwise provided by the municipality's ordinances or charter, an elected 
26 official of a municipality may be recalled from office pursuant to this section. For purposes 
27 of this section, "official" has the same meaning as section 2604, subsection 2, except that 
28 this section does not apply to the recall of a member of a school board, which is governed 
29 pursuant to Title 20-A, section 1005.
30SUMMARY
31 This bill provides that public school board members may only be recalled for specified 
32 behavior or misconduct and may not be recalled for the discretionary performance of a 
33 lawful act or prescribed duty of the school board member. The petition to recall the school 
34 board member must be signed by 25% of the voters who voted in the last gubernatorial 
35 election in the municipality or, if applicable, the school administrative unit, from which the 
36 school board member was elected and must be approved by a majority of voters in an 
37 election in which the total vote is at least 25% of the number of votes cast in the 
38 municipality or, if applicable, the school administrative unit, in the last gubernatorial 
39 election.31
