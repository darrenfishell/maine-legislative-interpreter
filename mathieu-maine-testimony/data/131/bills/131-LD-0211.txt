Page 1 - 131LR0503(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง6113, sub-ยง3, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 30, ยง1 and amended 
3 by PL 2003, c. 689, Pt. B, ยง6, is further amended to read:
43.  Use of water supply protection fund.  Except as provided in subsection 4, a water 
5 supply protection fund may be used by a consumer-owned water utility only for the 
6 acquisition, by itself or by the holder of a conservation easement, of interests in real 
7 property reasonably necessary for the protection of a public water supply, including, but 
8 not limited to, the acquisition of conservation easements, access easements, other 
9 permanent interests in land or long-term leases of at least 99 years and 3rd-party rights of 
10 enforcement of a conservation easement.  For purposes of this subsection , "protection of 
11 public water supply" includes watershed protection, groundwater protection or wellhead 
12 protection reasonably necessary to minimize the potential for contamination of the 
13 consumer-owned water utility's water supply.  If the consumer-owned water utility has 
14 adopted a watershed control program pursuant to 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 
15 141.71 and that program has been approved by the Department of Health and Human 
16 Services, any expenditures from the water supply protection fund pursuant to this section 
17 for the purposes of watershed protection must be in conformity with that watershed control 
18 program.  For purposes of this subsection, "conservation easement" has the same meaning 
19 as in Title 33, section 476, subsection 1; "holder" has the same meaning as in Title 33, 
20 section 476, subsection 2; and "3rd-party right of enforcement" has the same meaning as 
21 in Title 33, section 476, subsection 4.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill allows a water supply protection fund established by a consumer-owned water 
24 utility to be used by the holder of a conservation easement.  It also allows a water supply 
25 protection fund to be used for the acquisition of 3rd-party rights of enforcement of a 
26 conservation easement.23
