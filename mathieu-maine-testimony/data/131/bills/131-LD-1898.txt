4§6555.  Dangerous behavior prevention and intervention
51.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
6 following terms have the following meanings.
7 A.  "Administrator" has the same meaning as in section 13001‑A, subsection 1.

14 teacher or school staff person of an incident of dangerous behavior  made by a teacher or 
15 school staff person, a school administrative unit shall review the reported incident and 
16 develop an individualized response plan in accordance with this subsection.  The review of 
17 the reported incident must be conducted by an administrator and an assigned public school 
18 employee.  If the report of the incident of dangerous behavior is substantiated, the school 
19 administrative unit shall, in consultation with the public school employee who was 
20 subjected to the dangerous behavior, if any, develop an individualized response plan to 
21 avoid future dangerous behavior, which may include but is not limited to:
22 A.  Minimizing suspension and expulsion of the student;
23 B.  Prioritizing counseling and guidance services for the student and educators;
24 C.  Providing positive behavioral interventions and supports and supports designed to

29 E.  Training for public school employees who interact with the student; and

31 implement the plan.
32 Nothing in this subsection may be construed as limiting any federally protected right of a 
33 student, including, but not limited to, federally protected rights of students with disabilities.
34 Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of a student 
35 eligible for services under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or 
36 protected from discrimination under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
37 any discussions or actions related to the identification, evaluation or educational placement 
38 of the student or provision of a free, appropriate public education to the student must take 
39 place through the processes established under federal law.
403.  Collective bargaining dispute.  If a public school employee was subjected to the 
41 dangerous behavior and that employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, a 
Page 2 - 131LR2496(01)42 dispute arising out of the incident of dangerous behavior is subject to the dispute resolution 
43 process of the collective bargaining agreement.

5 collective bargaining agreement arising out of an incident of dangerous behavior by a 
6 student is subject to the dispute resolution process of the collective bargaining agreement.1
