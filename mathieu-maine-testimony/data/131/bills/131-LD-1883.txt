Page 1 - 131LR2396(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA ยง58 is enacted to read:
3ยง58.  The Protection of Shared Physical and Digital Property from Warrantless 
4Searches Act
51. Short title. This section may be known and cited as "the Protection of Shared 
6 Physical and Digital Property from Warrantless Searches Act."
72. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
8 following terms have the following meanings.
9 A. "Digital property" means information that a person creates that:
10 (1) Is stored in digital form and includes the information necessary to access the 
11 digital property; or
12 (2) The person has shared with a 3rd party in connection to the provision of goods 
13 or services to the person and is recorded in digital form and includes digital records 
14 containing the information.
15 "Digital property" does not include information a person voluntarily shares with the 
16 public or with a 3rd party with the understanding that the 3rd party will share that 
17 information with the public.
18 B. "Government agent" means an individual who is employed by or contracted to a 
19 federal, state or local governmental entity.
20 C. "Physical property" means all real and personal property that a person owns or 
21 possesses, including:
22 (1)  All real and personal property that a person shares with a 3rd party in 
23 connection to the provision of goods or services to that person; and 
24 (2) Information a person shares with a 3rd party in connection to the provision of 
25 goods or services to that person that is recorded in physical form, including all 
26 physical records containing the information. 
27 "Physical property" does not include information a person voluntarily shares with the 
28 public or with a 3rd party with the understanding that the 3rd party will share that 
29 information with the public. 
30 D. "Third party" means a party different from a person or government agent, that 
31 maintains physical property or digital property about the person as part of providing 
32 that person goods or services.
333. Prohibition. A government agent may not search or seize physical property or 
34 digital property of a person that is held by a 3rd party without first obtaining a search 
35 warrant based on probable cause, except: 
36 A. After receiving the permission of the owner of the digital property or physical 
37 property; or 
38 B. To respond to an imminent threat to a person's life, safety or property or a similar 
39 exigent circumstance. 
Page 2 - 131LR2396(01)14. Notice.  A government agent, when executing a search warrant, shall provide notice 
2 and a copy of the warrant authorizing the search to the owner of the digital property or 
3 physical property as well as any 3rd party whose property has been searched or from whom 
4 property has been seized. A court, upon a showing by the government agent that providing 
5 the search warrant to the owner of the digital property or physical property would impede 
6 or otherwise jeopardize an ongoing investigation, may delay the giving of such notice for 
7 a reasonable period not to exceed 30 days after the date of the execution of the warrant or 
8 on a later date certain if the facts of the case justify a longer period of delay. 
95. Remedies. A person aggrieved by a search or seizure of the person's physical 
10 property or digital property possessed by a 3rd party may challenge the search or seizure 
11 as if the property had been searched in the person's possession or seized directly from the 
12 person, including by pursuing a civil action under the Maine Civil Rights Act. In an action 
13 under this subsection, a prevailing plaintiff may recover declaratory relief, injunctive relief, 
14 compensatory damages, nominal damages and attorney's fees. Any evidence obtained 
15 pursuant to a search or seizure conducted in violation of this section is inadmissible in any 
16 administrative, civil or criminal proceeding.
17SUMMARY
18 This bill requires a search warrant for physical property and digital property held by a 
19 3rd party in the same manner as required for property held by the person against whom a 
20 warrant is executed.18
