2Sec. 1.  4 MRSA §6, as amended by PL 2019, c. 475, §35, is further amended to 
3 read:
4§6.  Active Retired Justices
5 Any Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, who has retired from the court under this 
6 chapter in effect prior to December 1, 1984, or any Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court 
7 who retires or terminates service on the court in accordance with chapter 27, except for a 
8 disability retirement, is eligible for appointment as an Active Retired Justice of the Supreme 
9 Judicial Court as provided. The Governor may, subject to review by the joint standing 
10 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary and to confirmation by the 
11 Legislature, appoint any eligible justice as an Active Retired Justice of the Supreme Judicial 
12 Court for a term of 7 years, unless sooner removed, and that justice may be reappointed for 
13 a like term. Any justice appointed and designated as an Active Retired Justice of the 
14 Supreme Judicial Court constitutes a part of the court from which the Justice retired and 
15 has the same jurisdiction and is subject to the same restrictions as before retirement, except 
16 that the Active Retired Justice may only be assigned to sit on civil or criminal actions and 
17 proceedings before the Law Court as provided in section 51 and may act only in  the all 
18 other cases and matters and hold court only at the terms and times as directed and assigned 
19 by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. The Chief Justice is empowered and 
20 authorized to assign and designate an Active Retired Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court 
21 as to that justice's services and may direct as to which term of the Law Court the Active 
22 Retired Justice attends, and , except as provided in section 51, may order the Active Retired 
23 Justice to hear all matters and issue all orders, notices, decrees and judgments in vacation 
24 that any Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court is authorized to hear or issue.
25Sec. 2.  4 MRSA §51, as amended by PL 2007, c. 518, §1, is further amended to 
26 read:
27§51.  Constitution of court; concurrence required
28 When sitting as a Law Court to determine questions of law arising in any civil or 
29 criminal action or proceeding, the Supreme Judicial Court must be composed as provided 
30 by rules adopted by that court  of a panel of 7 justices and shall hear and determine such 
31 questions by the concurrence of a majority of the 7 justices sitting and qualified to act  in 
32 accordance with this section.
33 If, at any point in time prior to the issuance of a final judgment in any civil or criminal 
34 action or proceeding before the Law Court, fewer than 7 Justices of the Supreme Judicial 
35 Court are available to sit and qualified to act on the questions of law arising in the action 
36 or proceeding, the clerk of the Law Court shall randomly assign, from the pool of all Active 
37 Retired Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court appointed under section 6, a sufficient 
38 number of Active Retired Justices to sit on the panel so that the panel is composed of a total 
39 of 7 justices.  If an insufficient number of justices and Active Retired Justices of the 
40 Supreme Judicial Court is available to sit and qualified to act on the questions of law arising 
41 in any civil or criminal action or proceeding before the Law Court, the clerk of the Law 
42 Court shall, in addition to assigning all available and qualified Active Retired Justices of 
43 the Supreme Judicial Court to sit on the panel, randomly assign, from the pool of all Justices 
44 of the Superior Court qualified for assignment to the Law Court under section 123 and of 
Page 2 - 131LR0884(01)45 all Judges of the District Court qualified for assignment to the Law Court under section 
46 157-F, a sufficient number of Justices of the Superior Court and Judges of the District Court 
47 to sit on the panel as justices to ensure that the panel is composed of a total of 7 justices.
4 The designation of an Active Retired Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, a Justice 
5 of the Superior Court or a Judge of the District Court to sit on a panel of the Law Court 
6 must be docketed in the record of the action or proceeding to which the justice or judge has 
7 been assigned.
8 The Supreme Judicial Court shall adopt rules necessary to carry out the requirements 
9 of this section.
10Sec. 3.  4 MRSA §123 is enacted to read:
11§123.  Justice of the Superior Court eligible to sit on the Law Court
12 The clerk of the Law Court may assign any Justice of the Superior Court who has 
13 served for at least 5 years as a Justice of the Superior Court and who has volunteered for 
14 assignment to the Law Court to sit on the panel for a civil or criminal action or proceeding 
15 before the Law Court as provided in section 51.  When so assigned, the justice has the same 
16 authority and jurisdiction as a regular Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court and may issue 
17 all orders, notices and opinions that a Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court sitting on the 
18 panel for the same action or proceeding may issue.
19Sec. 4.  4 MRSA §157-F is enacted to read:
20§157-F.  Judge of the District Court eligible to sit on the Law Court
21 The clerk of the Law Court may assign any Judge of the District Court who has served

25 and jurisdiction as a regular Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court and may issue all orders, 
26 notices and opinions that a Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court sitting on the panel for 
27 the same action or proceeding may issue.
