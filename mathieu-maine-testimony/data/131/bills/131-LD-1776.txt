Page 1 - 131LR0787(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  5 MRSA ยง9065 is enacted to read:
3ยง9065.  Public oversight
41. Public oversight.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, a person in the 
5 State may exercise oversight of agency actions and rulemaking under this section.
62. Petition. Any person in the State may petition the Department of Environmental 
7 Protection, the Department of Marine Resources or the Attorney General, as a named 
8 person or anonymously through a process developed by the Attorney General in 
9 cooperation with the Department of Labor for the protection of whistleblowers or 
10 anonymous complainants who demonstrate a need for protection, to enforce a law 
11 regarding the Department of Environmental Protection or the Department of Marine 
12 Resources, to enforce or amend a Department of Environmental Protection or Department 
13 of Marine Resources rule or to intervene in a rule-making or enforcement proceeding of 
14 the Department of Environmental Protection or the Department of Marine Resources that 
15 protects or conserves a natural resource, the environment, public health or freedom of 
16 information, including the common law. A petition under this subsection must set out a 
17 sufficiently specific allegation supported by facts that provide reasonable cause to believe 
18 an investigation or a new rule implementing existing law is warranted. If after 60 days of 
19 receipt of the petition, except in the case of likely more immediate irreparable harm under 
20 subsection 3, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Marine 
21 Resources or the Attorney General has not responded to the petition, the person may bring 
22 an action in the appropriate court to enforce the law or rule or provide relief in law or equity 
23 under the law or rule.
243. Irreparable harm. If irreparable harm to the person, the natural resource, the 
25 environment, public health or freedom of information under subsection 2 is likely to occur, 
26 the petitioner may file an action as soon as possible and the court shall schedule a hearing 
27 on the petition in a timely manner and grant standing to the petitioner under this section. 
284. Attorney's fees and expert witness fees.  If a petition under subsection 2 survives 
29 a motion to dismiss or the period of time in which a motion to dismiss is required to be 
30 filed, the court shall award the petitioner initial reasonable attorney's fees, expert witness 
31 fees and costs. If final judgment favors the petitioner, the court shall award complete 
32 reasonable attorney's fees, expert witness fees and costs for any portion of the judgment 
33 that favors the petitioner.
345. Notice of rulemaking or issuance of permit.  The Department of Environmental 
35 Protection or the Department of Marine Resources shall notify the public of a proposed 
36 rule under Title 12, section 6191 or Title 38, section 341-H or the processing of a permit 
37 application under Title 12, chapter 605, subchapter 2 or Title 38, section 344, describing 
38 the scope and timing of any deliberative proceeding and the process of applying for 
39 financial assistance under subsection 6. 
406. Financial assistance for participation in deliberative proceedings. The 
41 administrator under subsection 8 shall budget and award sufficient funds from the fund 
42 under subsection 8 to ensure the participation of a person in the State responding to or 
43 participating in a rule-making activity or processing of a permit application, except for the 
44 applicant, to pay the expenses of legal services, expert witnesses and other costs reasonably 
Page 2 - 131LR0787(01)45 related to participation and providing testimony to a deliberative proceeding noticed under 
46 subsection 5. The administrator under subsection 8 shall pay funds to a person who has 
47 provided legal opinion or expert testimony or who has otherwise participated in a 
48 deliberative proceeding noticed under subsection 5, except that the administrator may limit 
49 an award under this subsection and subsection 7 that covers the reasonable expenses 
50 concerning each point of contention to avoid a redundant fee award.  This limitation may 
51 be subject to interlocutory appeal to the appropriate court.
87. Fee awards for administrative appeals or judicial review.  The administrator 
9 under subsection 8 shall pay from the fund under subsection 8 initial attorney's fees, expert 
10 witness fees and other reasonable expenses to a petitioner under an appeal or agency action  
11 under this subchapter or judicial review of agency action under subchapter 7 that has a 
12 reasonable evidentiary and legal basis and that survives a motion to dismiss or the period 
13 in which a motion to dismiss is required to be filed.  If the ruling or judgment grants relief 
14 to the petitioner, the administrator under subsection 8 shall award reasonable attorney's 
15 fees, witness fees and related costs to the petitioner from the fund under subsection 8.
168. Fund for Oversight.  The Fund for Oversight is established to provide for attorney's 
17 fees, expert witness fees and reasonable expenses under this section. The fund is 
18 administered by an administrator, appointed by the Governor for a period of 4 years.  The 
19 administrator may impose fees on a person licensed or holding a permit under this Title 
20 that allows the person to pollute the air, water or land or engage in consumptive commercial 
21 use of natural resources of the State based upon the extent of consumptive or detrimental 
22 use or pollution the license or permit allows and sufficient to cover the reasonable expenses 
23 of the fund, the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Marine 
24 Resources in issuing, overseeing and enforcing each permit and ensuring a reasonable 
25 balance in the fund to fulfill the purposes of the fund, as determined by the administrator.  
26 The fund is funded by appropriations, allocations, public and private sources and fees 
27 imposed under this subsection.  The fund is interest-bearing, and interest earned by the fund 
28 is credited to the fund.  The fund does not lapse but carries over to the next fiscal year.  
29 Funds in the fund must be used to pay fees under subsections 6 and 7 and the cost of 
30 administration of this section.
31SUMMARY
32 This bill allows a person in the State to anonymously petition the Department of 
33 Environmental Protection, the Department of Marine Resources or the Attorney General to 
34 enforce a law regarding either department or to enforce or amend a rule of either department 
35 that protects or conserves a natural resource, the environment, public health or freedom of 
36 information, including the common law. If either department or the Attorney General does 
37 not respond, the person may bring an action in court and win attorney's fees, expert witness 
38 fees and other reasonable costs in certain circumstances.  The bill also creates a fund for 
39 oversight administered by an administrator appointed by the Governor to pay the legal 
40 expenses, expert witness fees and other costs for people not seeking a permit for 
41 commercial use but seeking to enforce a law or enforce or amend a department rule by 
42 participating in adjudicatory and judicial proceedings regarding agency rulemaking and 
43 issuance of licenses and permits.1
