24 employer policy during the first 7 calendar days of the leave.
252.  Determination of weekly benefit amount.  The weekly benefit amount paid to 
26 employees and self-employed individuals on family leave or medical leave is 90% of an 
27 employee's or self-employed individual's average weekly wage calculated over the past 4 
28 quarters, except for any bonus pay.
293.  Maximum benefit amount adjustment.  The maximum weekly benefit amount 
30 calculated under subsection 2 is 120% of the state average weekly wage. By October 1,

32 amount as necessary, and the adjusted maximum weekly benefit amount takes effect on 
33 January 1st of the year following the adjustment.

12 benefits or medical leave benefits no more than 60 days before the anticipated start date of

20 must be treated as confidential and may not be disclosed except with permission from the 
21 covered individual who provided it unless disclosure is otherwise required by law. Nothing

24 the federal Social Security Act, 42 United States Code, Section 1320d-6.
255.  Ineligibility.  A covered individual is not eligible to receive family leave benefits

27 that the covered individual, for the purpose of obtaining these benefits, has willfully made 
28 a false statement or misrepresentation regarding a material fact or has willfully withheld a 
29 material fact concerning the facts required to be certified pursuant to this section. The 
30 administrator shall establish a process by rule for the determination of eligibility under this 
31 section, including a grievance process for a covered individual determined to be ineligible.
32§850-E.  Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Fund
331.  Fund established.  The Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Fund is 
34 established to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. The fund is administered by the 
35 Treasurer of State. Any sums received under this section are not considered revenue of the 
36 State, but must be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of covered individuals eligible for 
37 family leave benefits and medical leave benefits under this subchapter and for the 
38 administration of this subchapter by the administrator. Funds may not be expended, 
39 released, appropriated or otherwise disposed of for any other purpose and must be expended 
40 by the administrator as required by this subchapter to pay family leave benefits and medical 
41 leave benefits to covered individuals eligible to receive benefits and to pay the

12 may not exceed 5% of the amount deposited under subsection 2 for each fiscal year 
13 following the initial year family leave benefits and medical leave benefits are paid. Money 
14 may not be commingled with other state funds and must be maintained in a separate 
15 account.
165.  Payment of benefits.  The administrator shall expend money from the fund to 
17 provide weekly family leave benefits and medical leave benefits under section 850-C. 
18 Family leave benefits and medical leave benefits must be paid from the fund to covered 
19 individuals eligible for benefits. An employer's bankruptcy or noncompliance with this 
20 subchapter does not interfere with an employee's ability to collect family leave benefits and 
21 medical leave benefits under this subchapter. Family leave benefits and medical leave 
22 benefits paid from the fund to such an employee may be recovered through bankruptcy 
23 proceedings or from the noncomplying employer. The administrator shall institute 
24 administrative and legal action to recover family leave benefits and medical leave benefits 
25 paid through the fund.
266.  Report.  Beginning October 1, 2026 and annually thereafter, the administrator shall

Page 18 - 131LR0009(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill implements a paid family and medical leave benefits program based on the 
3 recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave 
4 Benefits Program established by the 130th Legislature. The program provides up to 12 
5 weeks of family leave and up to 12 weeks of medical leave to eligible covered individuals. 
6 No more than 16 weeks of family leave and medical leave in the aggregate may be taken 
7 in a 12-month period. An individual is eligible for leave under the program after earning at 
8 least 6 times the state average weekly wage in the preceding 4 calendar quarters prior to 
9 submitting an application or if the individual is self-employed and has elected to be part of 
10 the program.
11 The maximum weekly benefit amount is capped at 120% of the state average weekly 
12 wage. The weekly benefit amount is 90% of the covered individual's average weekly wage.
13 Covered individuals are required to file claims for benefits in accordance with rules 
14 adopted by the department administering the program and to provide certification that they 
15 qualify for family leave or medical leave.
16 The bill establishes the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Fund to support the 
17 program. The funds for administrative costs and payment of benefits come from payroll 
18 contributions of no more than 1% of wages shared by employers and employees, except 
19 that employers with fewer than 15 employees are not required to make employer 
20 contributions to the program. The bill also authorizes employers to provide these benefits 
21 through a private plan as long as the benefits for family and medical leave provided to their 
22 employees are the same as provided in the program. 
23 The bill establishes the Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Authority to advise 
24 the administrator on the implementation and administration of the program.
25 The bill requires payroll contributions to begin January 1, 2025 and benefit claims to 
26 be processed beginning January 1, 2026.
27 The bill authorizes the Department of Economic and Community Development to 
28 conduct outreach with businesses about the paid family and medical leave benefits 
29 program.
30 The bill requires the program to be reviewed under the State Government Evaluation 
31 Act in 2029.2
