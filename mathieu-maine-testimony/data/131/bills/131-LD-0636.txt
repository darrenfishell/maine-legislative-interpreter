10 personal care agency, general hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, 
11 ambulatory surgical center, hospice agency or end-stage renal disease unit and to remedy

17 long-term care facility, home health care provider, personal care agency, general hospital, 
18 specialty hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory surgical center, hospice agency or

Page 14 - 131LR0154(01)45 that endangers the safety or health of the residents or clients, if the total cost of the 
46 correction does not exceed $3,000.  The court may order expenditures for this purpose 
47 in excess of $3,000 on application from the receiver; and
4 F.  Exercise such additional powers and perform such additional duties, including 
5 regular accountings, as the court considers appropriate.

8 care provider, personal care agency, general hospital, specialty hospital, critical access 
9 hospital, ambulatory surgical center, hospice agency or end-stage renal disease unit to 
10 current operating expenses and, subject to the following provisions, to debts incurred 
11 by the licensee prior to the appointment of the receiver.  The receiver shall ask the court 
12 for direction in the treatment of debts incurred prior to appointment where such  when 
13 the debts appear extraordinary, of questionable validity, or unrelated to the normal and 
14 expected maintenance and operation of the long-term care facility, home health care 
15 provider, personal care agency, general hospital, specialty hospital, critical access 
16 hospital, ambulatory surgical center, hospice agency or end-stage renal disease unit, or 
17 where  when payment of the debts will interfere with the purposes of the receivership.  
18 Priority must be given by the receiver to expenditures for current direct resident or 
19 client care.  Revenues held by or owing to the receiver in connection with the operation 
20 of the long-term care facility, home health care provider, personal care agency, general 
21 hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory surgical center, hospice 
22 agency or end-stage renal disease unit are exempt from attachment and trustee process,

25 home health care provider, personal care agency, general hospital, specialty hospital, 
26 critical access hospital, ambulatory surgical center, hospice agency or end-stage renal 
27 disease unit that endangers the safety or health of the resident or client, if the total cost 
28 of the correction does not exceed $3,000.  On application by the receiver, the court may 
29 order expenditures for this purpose in excess of $3,000. The licensee or owner may 
30 apply to the court to determine the reasonableness of any expenditure over $3,000 by 
31 the receiver.
32 C.  In the event that the receiver does not have sufficient funds to cover expenses 
33 needed to prevent or remove jeopardy to the residents or clients, the receiver may 
34 petition the court for permission to borrow for these purposes. Notice of the receiver's 
35 petition to the court for permission to borrow must be given to the owner, the licensee 
36 and the department.  The court may, after hearing, authorize the receiver to borrow 
37 money upon specified terms of repayment and to pledge security, if necessary, if the 
38 court determines that the long-term care facility, home health care provider, personal 
39 care agency, general hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory 
40 surgical center, hospice agency or end-stage renal disease unit should not be closed and 
41 that the loan is reasonably necessary to prevent or remove jeopardy or if it determines 
42 that the long-term care facility, home health care provider, personal care agency, 
43 general hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory surgical center, 
44 hospice agency or end-stage renal disease unit should be closed and that the 
45 expenditure is necessary to prevent or remove jeopardy to residents or clients for the 
46 limited period of time that they are awaiting transfer. The purpose of this provision is 1
2
3
Page 15 - 131LR0154(01)47 to protect residents or clients and to prevent the closure of long-term care facilities, 
48 home health care providers, personal care agencies, general hospitals, specialty 
49 hospitals, critical access hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, hospice agencies or 
50 end-stage renal disease units that, under proper management, are likely to be viable 
51 operations.  This section may not be construed as a method of financing major repair 
52 or capital improvements to facilities that have been allowed to deteriorate because the 
53 owner or licensee has been unable or unwilling to secure financing by conventional 
54 means.
93.  Avoidance of preexisting leases, mortgages and contracts.  A receiver may not 
10 be required to honor a lease, mortgage, secured transaction or other contract entered into 
11 by the owner or licensee of the long-term care facility, home health care provider, personal 
12 care agency, general hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory 
13 surgical center, hospice agency or end-stage renal disease unit if the court finds that:
14 A.  The person seeking payment under the agreement has an ownership interest in the 
15 long-term care facility, home health care provider, personal care agency, general 
16 hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory surgical center, hospice 
17 agency or end-stage renal disease unit or was related to the licensee, the long-term care 
18 facility, home health care provider, personal care agency, general hospital, specialty 
19 hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory surgical center, hospice agency or end-
20 stage renal disease unit by a significant degree of common ownership or control at the 
21 time the agreement was made; or
22 B.  The rental, price or rate of interest required to be paid under the agreement is in 
23 excess of a reasonable rental, price or rate of interest.
24 If the receiver is in possession of real estate or goods subject to a lease, mortgage or security 
25 interest that the receiver is permitted to avoid and if the real estate or goods are necessary 
26 for the continued operation of the long-term care facility, home health care provider, 
27 personal care agency, general hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, 
28 ambulatory surgical center, hospice agency or end-stage renal disease unit, the receiver 
29 may apply to the court to set a reasonable rental, price or rate of interest to be paid by the 
30 receiver during the term of the receivership. The court shall hold a hearing on the 
31 application within 15 days, and the receiver shall send notice of the application to any 
32 known owners and mortgagees of the property at least 10 days before the hearing. Payment 
33 by the receiver of the amount determined by the court to be reasonable is a defense to an 
34 action against the receiver for payment or for the possession of the subject goods or real 
35 estate by a person who received such notice.
36 Notwithstanding this subsection, there may not be a foreclosure or eviction during the 
37 receivership by any person if the foreclosure or eviction would, in view of the court, serve 
38 to defeat the purpose of the receivership.

40agency, general hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory 
41surgical center, hospice agency or end-stage renal disease unit.  The receiver may not 
42 close the long-term care facility, home health care provider, personal care agency, general 
43 hospital, specialty hospital, critical access hospital, ambulatory surgical center, hospice 
44 agency or end-stage renal disease unit without leave of the court.  In ruling on the issue of

8 When a long-term care facility, home health care provider, personal care agency, general

10 agency or end-stage renal disease unit is closed, the receiver shall provide for the orderly 
11 transfer of residents or clients to mitigate transfer trauma.

9 care workers who are ineligible for employment to be listed on the Maine Registry of 
10 Certified Nursing Assistants and Direct Care Workers.  The bill removes registration
