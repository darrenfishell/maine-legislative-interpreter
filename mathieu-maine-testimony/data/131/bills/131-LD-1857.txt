61.  Definitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
7 following terms have the following meanings.
8 A.  "Culturally competent provider" means a licensed provider with specialized first 
9 responder certification through a designated state or national body or specialized 
10 experience with the complex needs of each discipline of public safety employment, 
11 including the cumulative impact of exposure to traumatic events, impacts of cumulative 
12 trauma exposure on public safety professionals' physical and mental well-being or 
13 career-specific knowledge and sensitivity, and continuing specialized knowledge of 
14 public safety psychology.
15 B.  "Fire department" means a municipal fire department or volunteer fire association 
16 as defined by Title 30-A, section 3151.
17 C.  "Fund" means the Public Safety Health and Wellness Reimbursement Fund 
18 established in subsection 2.
19 D.  "Government entity" means the State or a municipality, plantation or county.
20 E.  "Public safety agency" means a government entity that provides or has the authority 
21 to provide fire, emergency medical, emergency communications, correctional or police 
22 services.
23 F.  "Public safety employee" means an employee of a public safety agency.
24 G.  "Wellness visits" means confidential visits that provide a public safety employee 
25 an opportunity for a positive interaction with a qualified mental health professional that 
26 does not evaluate the employee, but offers opportunities for improved mental health 
27 through wellness strategies and stress management, including referrals for ongoing 
28 confidential counseling.
292.  Reimbursement fund established.  The Public Safety Health and Wellness 
30 Reimbursement Fund is established to reimburse the costs of a culturally competent 
31 provider providing specialized counseling and health screenings to address the physical 
32 and mental health effects experienced by public safety employees. The fund must be used 
33 to reimburse culturally competent providers and providers of specialized cardiac and 
34 metabolic screening under subsection 3 for all public safety employees.  The department 
35 shall reimburse a government entity, fire department or public safety agency for the costs 
36 associated with providing all public safety employees services under subsection 3 or 4, 
37 including through telehealth services. A public safety agency may not reduce a behavioral, 
38 mental or physical health care benefit package as a result of receiving funds under this 
39 chapter.  Except as otherwise required by law, all services under this section are 
40 confidential and, if wellness visits are mandated as a provision of employment by a public 
Page 2 - 131LR2345(01)41 safety agency, only confirmation of attendance may be shared with the agency.  The 
42 department may use up to 5% of the funds allocated to the fund to administer the fund.
33.  Specialized cardiac and metabolic screening.  In order to receive money from the 
4 fund, a program for specialized cardiac and metabolic screening must provide biennial 
5 screenings of public safety employees. The results of the screening and any advice for 
6 continued treatment of identified health issues must be provided to the employee and the 
7 employee's physician. The screening program must provide a medical consultation and an 
8 individualized plan including nutrition, fitness and wellness recommendations to the 
9 employee when appropriate. Testing must include screening for:
10 A.  An advanced lipid panel, including a cardiac inflammatory biomarker analysis;
11 B.  Liver and kidney function;
12 C.  Thyroid, prostate and other cancers or diseases that are prevalent among first 
13 responders at a higher rate than the civilian population, such as diabetes; and
14 D.  Cardiologist-guided, public safety-specific, cardio-metabolic stress testing.
154.  Mental health wellness and resiliency. In order to receive money from the fund, a 
16 program for mental health wellness and resiliency must provide confidential annual 
17 wellness visits by culturally competent providers for all public safety employees and may 
18 coordinate training in areas of mental resiliency and peer support for public safety 
19 employees.  The program:
20 A.  May include a referral for additional counseling services for the participating 
21 employee including the employee's immediate family; and
22 B.  May include a referral to inpatient services or to a specialist. 
23 Unless otherwise provided by law, services under this subsection may not be used as a basis 
24 for employment termination.
255.  Choice of provider. The department shall adopt rules as necessary to define 
26 contractual terms, conditions for reimbursement, quality of performance standards and 
27 other provisions as necessary for the administration of this chapter. The rules must be 
28 adopted in consultation with a statewide association representing the interests of law 
29 enforcement officers, a statewide association representing the interests of firefighters from 
30 volunteer and career fire service agencies, a statewide association representing sheriffs, the 
31 Commissioner of Corrections or the commissioner's designee, the Commissioner of Public 
32 Safety or the commissioner's designee and the Director of Maine Emergency Medical 
33 Services within the Department of Public Safety or the director's designee. A public safety 
34 agency may choose the agency's own provider for a program under this section, as long as 
35 the provider meets the requirements in this section. Notwithstanding Title 5, chapter 375, 
36 the rules must be published and are subject to a 30-day public review period prior to taking 
37 final effect.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined 
38 in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.  The department shall administer any additional 
39 funds that may be available from private, local, state or federal sources for the provision of 
40 reimbursements under this chapter.
41Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §1818, as amended by PL 2021, c. 645, §5 and c. 669, §5, is 
42 repealed and the following enacted in its place:
