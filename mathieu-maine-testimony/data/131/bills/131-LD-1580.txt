9 then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost of living. The increase 
10 in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, if any, as of August of 
11 the previous year over the level as of August of the year preceding that year in the 
12 Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for the 
13 Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the United States Department of 
14 Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount of the minimum 
15 wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.  If the highest federal minimum wage 
16 is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect under this section, the minimum wage 
17 under this section is increased to the same amount, effective on the same date as the 
18 increase in the federal minimum wage, and must be increased in accordance with this 
19 section thereafter.
