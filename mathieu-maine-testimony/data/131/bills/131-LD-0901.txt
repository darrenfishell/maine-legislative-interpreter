23 land, its ecosystems and its people for the future, including, but not limited to, 
24 maintaining organic certification through the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners 
25 Association or a similar organization, refraining from using pesticides, the use of 
26 permanent beds, robust crop rotation, cover cropping schemes or agroforestry practices 
27 or the integration of livestock and crop agriculture.

29 A. At least 5 years of experience as an owner, manager or operator of a farm;

6 the upcoming season; and
7 E. The name and birth date of an apprentice the mentor plans to hire.
84. Review of applications.  The department shall review applications submitted for the 
9 program and award grants to mentors to hire an apprentice.  Approval of an application

11 written plan to train and educate an apprentice.  Priority must be given to a mentor who has 
12 demonstrated a commitment to sustainability and community.
135. Program requirements.  The following provisions govern the use of grants 
14 distributed under the program.
15 A. A grant distributed to a mentor must be in the amount of $5,000 per apprentice.
16 B. A mentor may use a grant only for the payment of wages for the apprentice for 
17 which the grant application was submitted, except that if the mentor and the apprentice 
18 decide the placement is not a good fit and the mentor hires a new apprentice, the mentor 
19 shall notify the department of the change and may continue to use the grant to pay the 
20 new apprentice.
21 C. A mentor shall pay wages to the apprentice equal to or greater than the state 
22 minimum wage, and the hours worked by the apprentice must include education and 
23 training activities.
24 D. A mentor shall refund any unused portion of a grant to the department.
256. Report.  No later than December 1, 2024, the department shall submit a report to 
26 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over agricultural matters 
27 with recommendations on whether to continue the program, including recommendations 
28 on changing the eligibility requirements or number or amount of the grants awarded.  In 
29 developing the report, the department shall consider the importance of providing financial 
30 support for the training of new farm apprentices each year, supporting the State's farmland 
31 in sustainable ways to grow healthy, local food for communities throughout the State, 
32 ensuring that individuals aspiring to grow food in the State can earn a living wage and 
33 enjoy an acceptable quality of life while learning to farm and reducing the burden on 
34 mentoring farms while educating and training apprentices.  The committee may report out 
35 legislation related to the report to the 132nd Legislature in 2025.
