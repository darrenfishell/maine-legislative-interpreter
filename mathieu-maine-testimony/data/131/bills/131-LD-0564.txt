Page 1 - 131LR1002(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, Maine's civil legal aid providers offer a full range of legal assistance to 
4 Maine people with low or no income, from services that help individuals and families meet 
5 basic needs and assert other legal rights to advocacy efforts to advance and protect their 
6 legal interests on a systemic scale; and
7Whereas, approximately 356,500 Maine people have low income, living below 200% 
8 of the federal poverty level; and
9Whereas, most Maine people with low income face at least one civil legal issue each 
10 year that cannot be fairly resolved without legal advice or effective legal advocacy; and
11Whereas, Maine's civil legal aid providers currently lack the resources to provide 
12 representation to more than a small fraction of those who need their assistance with life-
13 altering legal issues; and
14Whereas, these providers are facing reductions in other sources of funding at the same 
15 time that the need for civil legal aid has been increasing dramatically; and
16Whereas, a timely increase in investment in the Maine Civil Legal Services Fund is 
17 essential to sustain and improve access to civil legal aid; and
18Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
19 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
20 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
21 therefore,
22Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
23Sec. 1.  Appropriations and allocations.  The following appropriations and 
24 allocations are made.
