7SUMMARY
8 Current law provides that a person commits a traffic infraction when that person 
9 operates a motor vehicle after suspension or revocation and the person has not been 
10 convicted or adjudicated of a prior operating after suspension offense and the sole basis for 
11 the suspension is either failure to pay a fine, failure to pay a license reinstatement fee or 
12 suspension for a dishonored check.
13 This bill makes the default penalty for operating while license suspended or revoked a 
14 traffic infraction unless the person's license was suspended as a result of an OUI.8
