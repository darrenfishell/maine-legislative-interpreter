2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill would establish a publicly funded education program within publicly funded 
6 day care programs using the Educare model for children from birth to 5 years of age.  By 
7 connecting publicly funded day care to the kindergarten to grade 12 education system, the 
8 bill would create an affordable, accessible program for working parents.  Using an Educare 
9 model in the bill will:
10 1. Allow for the use of professionally trained staff earning public school wages, 
11 allowing more people to train as early education professionals and increasing the ability to 
12 retain them;
13 2. Assist children from low-income backgrounds or with a history of trauma to achieve 
14 readiness by kindergarten, instead of leaving them 3 years behind; and
15 3. Work with parents to increase parenting skills, increase workplace skills, decrease 
16 adverse childhood events and increase the family's emotional and financial stability.
17 The bill would implement the Educare model in 3 pilot programs in 3 service center 
18 communities.  Regional School Unit No. 13, which includes Rockland, must be one of the 
19 service center communities.4
