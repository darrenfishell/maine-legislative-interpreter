9 comparable work on jobs that have comparable requirements relating to skill, effort and 
10 responsibility. An employer may not discriminate between employees in the same 
11 establishment on the basis of race by paying wages to any employee in any occupation in

13 race for comparable work on jobs that have comparable requirements relating to skill, effort 
14 and responsibility. Differentials that are paid pursuant to established seniority systems or 
15 merit increase systems or difference in the shift or time of the day worked that do not 
16 discriminate on the basis of sex or race are not within  this prohibition  the prohibitions in 
17 this section. An employer may not discharge or discriminate against any employee by 
18 reason of any action taken by such employee to invoke or assist in any manner the 
19 enforcement of this section.  An employer may not prohibit an employee from disclosing 
20 the employee's own wages or from inquiring about or disclosing another employee's wages 
21 if the purpose of the disclosure or inquiry is to enforce the rights granted by this section.  
22 Nothing in this section creates an obligation to disclose wages.

24 Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters on progress made in the State to comply 
25 with this section.  The report must be issued annually on Equal Pay Day as designated

33 not discriminate between employees in the same establishment on the basis of race.  The
