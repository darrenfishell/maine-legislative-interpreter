19 A.  The department shall provide grants and funding to ensure the following services 
20 and any other services specified by the department by rule are available within each

38 provided by the department under this section may be used for copayments, deductibles 
39 or other out-of-pocket costs incurred by the person receiving the services.  This 
40 paragraph does not require a government medical assistance program to reimburse the 1

42 States Code, Section 1396a(25).
