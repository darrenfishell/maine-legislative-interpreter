Page 1 - 131LR0564(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, today's buildings often have multiple stories and are often serviced by an 
4 elevator; and
5Whereas, the ability to exit these buildings, particularly from higher floors, is 
6 important, especially in cases of evacuation by medical or emergency personnel; and
7Whereas, if evacuation involves carrying a person on a stretcher, an elevator's 
8 capacity to accommodate the stretcher can be essential to the person's survival; and
9Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
11 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
12 therefore,
13Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
14Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §15228, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 70, Pt. D, §35, is

17 is installed in a building being newly constructed or in a new addition that extends beyond

19 the building and be of sufficient size to allow the transport of a person on an ambulance 
20 stretcher in the fully supine position, without having to raise, lower or bend the stretcher in 
21 any way.  This requirement applies to all plans approved after January 1, 2002  meet the 
22 standard established by the International Building Code, published by the International 
23 Code Council, regarding elevator car accommodations for an ambulance stretcher, as 
24 adopted in the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code under Title 10, chapter 1103.  
25 The director shall adopt rules necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.  Rules

27 375, subchapter 2‑A.

29 takes effect when approved.
