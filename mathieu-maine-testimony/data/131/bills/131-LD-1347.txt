Page 1 - 131LR1811(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, net energy billing is unnecessary to incentivize more renewable energy 
4 projects; and
5Whereas, the longer net energy billing is in effect, the more it will add to ratepayers' 
6 energy bills, making this legislation necessary to end net energy billing as soon as possible; 
7 and
8Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
11 therefore,
12Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

18 in net energy billing and that meets the requirements of Title 35-A, section 3209-A, 
19 subsection 7 or Title 35-A, section 3209-B.

29 adjustment of the customer's transmission and distribution service bill by delivering 
30 electricity to the transmission and distribution utility from an electric generating facility 
31 owned or operated by that customer or in which that customer has a financial interest that 
32 is located in the service territory of the transmission and distribution utility in the State.

4Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
5 takes effect when approved.
6SUMMARY

8 governing net energy billing and that direct the commission to establish a net energy billing 
9 program for commercial and institutional customers of investor-owned transmission and 
10 distribution utilities and prohibits the commission from adopting rules that require a 
11 transmission and distribution utility to allow a customer to participate in net energy billing.7
