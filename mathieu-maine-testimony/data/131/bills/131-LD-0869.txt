13 routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A except that rules 
14 adopted pursuant to this subchapter specifying the diseases for which immunization is 
15 required are major substantive rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
16 Immunization requirements more stringent than the provisions of this subchapter may be 
17 adopted by a school board or by policy of a private school's governing board.
