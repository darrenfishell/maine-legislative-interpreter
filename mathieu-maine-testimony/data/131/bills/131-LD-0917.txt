2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the City of Rockland is authorized pursuant to state law and its charter to 
4 borrow money and to issue its general obligation bonds and notes in furtherance of its 
5 municipal purposes; and
6Whereas, at a city referendum held November 8, 2022, the voters of the city ratified 
7 and approved 3 bond ordinances that authorized the city to issue its general obligation 
8 bonds and notes for the following purposes and in the following amounts: an amount not 
9 to exceed $15,000,000 to finance roads and sidewalk improvements, $2,400,000 to finance 
10 the permanent closure of the city landfill and $15,000,000 to finance storm water projects, 
11 plus, in each instance, an amount not to exceed 2% to pay costs of issuance, all as described 
12 in the notices, warrants and ballots for the referendum; and
13Whereas, the voters of the city voted in favor of the 3 bond ordinance questions as 
14 follows: Question 1, roads and sidewalk improvements, 2,360 in favor and 736 against, 
15 with 171 blank ballots; Question 2, landfill closure, 1,866 in favor and 1,158 against, with 
16 243 blank ballots; and Question 3, storm water projects, 2,275 in favor and 796 against, 
17 with 196 blank ballots; and
18Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 5772, subsection 2-A 
19 requires that any question submitted to the electors for ratification of a general obligation 
20 bond be accompanied by a statement signed by the treasurer of the municipality setting 
21 forth certain information including the following: 
22 1. The total amount of bonds of the municipality outstanding and unpaid, the total 
23 amount of bonds of the municipality authorized and unissued and the total amount of bonds 
24 of the municipality contemplated to be issued if the submitted questions are ratified;
25 2. The estimated cost of interest on the bond amount to be issued and the total cost of 
26 principal and interest to be paid at maturity; and
27 3. A declaration that the validity of the bonds and of the voters' ratification of the bonds 
28 may not be affected by any errors in the foregoing estimate; and
29Whereas, due to an inadvertent oversight, the 3 bond ordinance questions were 
30 submitted to the voters without the signed statement required by Title 30-A, section 5772, 
31 subsection 2-A; and
32Whereas, the failure to include such a signed statement as strictly required by Title 
33 30-A, section 5772, subsection 2-A could affect the marketability of the bonds or notes to 
34 be issued by the city in connection with the projects; and
35Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
36 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
37 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
38 therefore,
39Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
