3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill, through a multiphase process, would establish a comprehensive continuum 
6 of coordinated services aimed at identifying, evaluating and supporting young children’s 
7 physical, emotional and social development.
8 1. The Department of Health and Human Services would collect an inventory of 
9 programs that currently exist through the Department of Education and the Department of 
10 Health and Human Services, including, but not limited to, the Early Childhood 
11 Comprehensive Systems program, Help Me Grow Maine and developmental screening, 
12 Early Childhood Consultation Partnership, Maternal and Child Health program, Partners 
13 in Care Coordination program, children with special health care needs care coordination, 
14 the State's Plan of Safe Care, CradleME, early intervention under the federal Individuals 
15 with Disabilities Education Act, Part C and any other related program that provides 
16 identification of delayed development or disabilities, referral, coordination or planning of 
17 services for children from birth through 3 years of age. The inventory would include:
18 A.  A description of the programs;
19 B.  Detailed funding streams for the programs, including the Title V Maternal Child 
20 Health Block Grant;
21 C.  The methods of finding, referring, planning and coordinating services for young 
22 children; and
23 D. Identification of areas in which processes can be streamlined and efficiencies made.  
24 2. A working group would analyze the information collected under section 1 and make 
25 recommendations to the Children's Cabinet established under the Maine Revised Statutes, 
26 Title 5, section 19131.  The working group would be a partnership of public and private 
27 stakeholders, including representatives of the programs evaluated, children's advocates, 
28 providers, parent advocacy representatives and early childhood educators.  The working 
29 group would provide recommendations to the Children's Cabinet for how to structure a new 
30 cabinet-level department that provides supportive learning and public health prevention 
31 and intervention services across a continuum of care to young children and their families.  
32 3. The Children’s Cabinet would develop a data-driven plan and report that takes into 
33 consideration the recommendations of the working group in order to develop a new 
34 cabinet-level department.  The report will provide clear milestones to be met in a timely 
35 fashion to develop the new department.  The Children's Cabinet would be required to 
36 submit a report to the joint standing committees of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
37 education matters and health and human services matters.  The committees will have 
38 authorization to submit legislation during the session in which the report is received.
39 4. A cabinet-level position would be established within available funds.  The position 
40 would be required to provide supportive, preventive, protective, learning and intervention 
41 services to young children and their families.  The cabinet-level position would develop a 4

43 evaluation, education and support of young children and their families.1
