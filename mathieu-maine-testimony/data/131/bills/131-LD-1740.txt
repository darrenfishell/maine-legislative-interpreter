9SUMMARY
10 Under current law, health care entities are required to provide an estimate of the total 
11 price of medical services to be rendered directly by that health care entity during a single 
12 medical encounter within a reasonable time of a request from an uninsured patient. This 
13 bill requires health care entities to provide a good faith estimate of the allowed amount 
14 under an insured patient's health insurance coverage to be paid by an insurer for the medical 
15 services to be rendered directly by that health care entity during a single medical encounter. 
16 This bill requires the information to be provided within 3 business days of a request from 
17 an insured patient to the patient and to the patient's health insurance carrier. This bill also 
18 requires health care entities to post notice of a patient's right to request this information in 
19 their offices and include such notice in a patient's written consent to treatment form that 
20 must be signed prior to receiving health care treatment or services. The bill requires health 
21 insurance carriers to provide an insured patient with an advanced explanation of benefits 
22 within 3 business days of receiving a good faith estimate from a health care entity for 
23 medical services.1
