23§1164.  Special Administrative Expense Fund
24 The Special Administrative Expense Fund is created as a special fund in the State 
25 Treasury.  All interest, fines and penalties collected under this chapter and all voluntary 
26 contributions tendered as a contribution to this fund must be paid into this fund.  The money 
27 may not be expended or available for expenditure in any manner that would permit its 
28 substitution for, or a corresponding reduction in, federal funds that would in the absence of 
29 that money be available to finance expenditures for the administration of the Employment 
30 Security Law  Reemployment Assistance Program.  Nothing in this section prevents the 
31 money from being used as a revolving fund to cover expenditures, necessary and proper 
32 under the law, for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, 
33 subject to the charging of those expenditures against those funds when received.  The 
34 money in this fund must be used by the commissioner either for the payment of costs of 
35 administration that are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against 
36 federal grants or other funds received for or in the Employment Security Administration 
37 Fund on or after January 1, 1943, to finance the Maine Wage Assurance Fund established 
38 in section 632; for the payment of costs of administering chapter 26, for which federal 
39 funds are not available; or to fund activities that will improve the solvency of the 
40 Unemployment Compensation Fund.  The money must be available either to satisfy the 
41 obligations incurred by the bureau directly or by requesting the Treasurer of State to 
42 transfer the required amount from the Special Administrative Expense Fund to the 
Page 2 - 131LR1628(01)43 Employment Security Administration Fund or the Maine Wage Assurance Fund.  The 
44 Treasurer of State shall upon receipt of a written request of the commissioner make any 
45 such transfer.  The commissioner shall give notice to the commission prior to any 
46 expenditures from this fund.  The commissioner shall order the transfer of the funds or the 
47 payment of any such obligation and the funds must be paid by the Treasurer of State on 
48 requisitions drawn by the commissioner directing the State Controller to issue the State 
49 Controller's warrant for them.  The warrant must be drawn by the State Controller based 
50 upon bills of particulars and vouchers certified by an officer or employee designated by the 
51 commissioner.  The money in this fund is specifically made available to replace, within a 
52 reasonable time, any money received by this State pursuant to section Section 302 of the 
53 Federal Social Security Act as amended that, because of any action or contingency, has 
54 been lost or has been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those 
55 necessary for the proper administration of the Employment Security Law  Reemployment 
56 Assistance Program.  The money in this fund must be continuously available to the 
57 commissioner for expenditure in accordance with this section and may not lapse at any time 
58 or be transferred to any other fund except as provided.  Any money in the Special 
59 Administrative Expense Fund may be used to make refunds of interest, penalties or fines 
60 erroneously collected and deposited in the Special Administrative Expense Fund.  On June 
61 30th of each year all money in excess of $100,000 in this fund must be transferred to the 
62 Unemployment Compensation Fund.

27 insured work during the individual's base period, plus the supplemental weekly benefit for 
28 dependents payable under subsection 6  if the state average unemployment rate is at or 
29 below 5.5%, plus an additional amount equal to one week of the individual's weekly benefit

21 must be charged against the experience rating record of the claimant's most recent 
22 subject employer or to the General Fund if the otherwise chargeable experience rating 
23 record is that of an employer whose status as such has been terminated; except that no 
24 charge may be made to an individual employer but must be made to the General Fund

27 in connection with the claimant's employment or was voluntary without good cause 
28 attributable to the employer;

34 paid to a claimant under a reciprocal benefits arrangement as authorized in section

36 state, the Virgin Islands or Canada under such an arrangement are less than the 
37 amount of wages for insured work required for benefit purposes by section 1192, 
38 subsection 5;
39 (6)  The claimant was hired by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
40 open by a Legislator given a leave of absence under chapter 7, subchapter 5‑A, and
