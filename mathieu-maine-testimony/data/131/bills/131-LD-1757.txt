35 Financial Services is required to develop and implement an electronic portal for use by 
36 licensees to submit required records.  Licensees are required to accompany all cannabis 
37 plants and harvested cannabis being transported with a label that provides specific 
38 information about the licensee and the cannabis being transported; that information also 
39 may be submitted through the electronic portal.  The department is prohibited from 
40 charging a fee or other cost to a licensee for using the electronic portal.
41 This bill also requires the department to terminate immediately its contract with Metrc, 
42 LLC, the company that is required to administer the tracking system used for adult use 
43 cannabis.1
