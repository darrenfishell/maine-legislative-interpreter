5 representative who in good faith reasonably relies on statements, declarations and 
6 representations made by a client on a client information form in accordance with this 
7 subsection may not be found in violation of this chapter for selling or serving a psilocybin 
8 product to that person based on those statements, declarations and representations.  Nothing 
9 in this subsection creates any immunity for a licensee or licensee representative who has 
10 otherwise violated this chapter or a rule adopted pursuant to this chapter.
112.  Refusal to serve.  Nothing in this chapter requires a licensee or licensee 
12 representative to provide psilocybin services to any person.  Except as provided in this 
13 section, a licensee or licensee representative may refuse to provide psilocybin services to 
14 any person or may cease providing such services to a client for any reason or for no reason

16 in the Maine Human Rights Act.  A licensee or licensee representative may not cease 
17 providing psilocybin services during an administration session after the client has 
18 consumed a psilocybin product except as authorized by the department by rule or as 
19 necessary in an emergency.
203. Insurance.  The department may by rule require licensees to maintain general 
21 liability insurance in an amount the department determines is reasonably affordable and 
22 available for the purpose of protecting licensees against damages resulting from causes of 
23 action related to activities undertaken pursuant to this chapter.
244.  Discrimination.  A licensee may not discharge, demote, suspend or in any manner 
25 discriminate or retaliate against an employee of the licensee with regard to promotion, 
26 compensation or other terms, conditions or privileges of employment on the basis that the 
27 employee has in good faith reported information to the department about an action or 
28 inaction of the licensee that the employee reasonably believes is a violation of this chapter 
29 or any rules adopted pursuant to this chapter. 
30§2015.  Enforceability of contracts
31 A contract involving psilocybin products is not unenforceable on the basis that 
32 manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, possessing or using psilocybin products is 
33 prohibited by federal law.

42 when further medical review is indicated by the risk assessment screening in order to 
Page 20 - 131LR0311(01)43 determine whether the use of psilocybin products would put the prospective client at 
44 increased risk so as to be ineligible to receive psilocybin services at that time;

17 provider for failing to properly evaluate or treat a person's medical condition or otherwise 
18 violating the applicable standard of care for evaluating or treating medical conditions. 
194. Informed consent required. The department shall adopt rules requiring a 
20 prospective client to review and sign a document informing the client prior to an 
21 administration session of the likely effects and potential risks of psilocybin use.
225. Administration session. The department shall adopt rules governing administration 
23 sessions.  The rules must:

30 B. A psilocybin service center operator may not discount a psilocybin product or offer 
31 a psilocybin product for free if the retail sale of the psilocybin product is made in 
32 conjunction with the retail sale of any other item or service. 
334. Review of rate.   The department shall regularly review the rate of tax under this 
34 section and make recommendations to the Legislature regarding appropriate adjustments 
35 to the rate to ensure the department has sufficient funds to administer and enforce Title 
36 28-B, chapter 5 but that the amount of funds, together with fees collected under that chapter, 
37 do not exceed the costs of administering and enforcing that chapter. 
38§4963. Collection of tax; refund; credit; penalties
39 The tax imposed upon the client under this chapter must be collected at the point of 
40 sale and remitted by each psilocybin service center operator that engages in the retail sale 
41 of psilocybin products. The tax is imposed upon the psilocybin service center operator that 
Page 32 - 131LR0311(01)42 is required to collect the tax, and the psilocybin service center operator is liable for the tax 
43 as the taxpayer.  For the purpose of compensating psilocybin service center operators for 
44 expenses incurred in collecting the tax imposed under this chapter, each psilocybin service 
45 center operator may deduct and retain 2% of the amount of taxes that are collected by the 
46 psilocybin service center operator from all retail sales of psilocybin products conducted by 
47 the psilocybin service center operator. 
71.  Filing.  A psilocybin service center operator shall file a return with the State Tax 
8 Assessor on or before the last day of January, April, July and October of each year for the 
9 previous calendar quarter.  A psilocybin service center operator shall file each return 
10 required under this section regardless of whether any tax is owed.  
11 A.  The psilocybin service center operator shall pay the tax to the State Tax Assessor 
12 in the form and manner prescribed by the State Tax Assessor, but not later than with 
13 each quarterly return, without regard to an extension granted under this subsection. 
14 B.  For good cause, the State Tax Assessor may extend the time for filing a return under 
15 this section. The extension may be granted at any time if a written request is filed with 
16 the State Tax Assessor during or prior to the period for which the extension may be 
17 granted. The State Tax Assessor may not grant an extension of more than 30 days.  
18 Interest accumulates on late-filed returns at the rate established in section 186. 
19 C. If a psilocybin service center operator fails to file a return or pay the tax as required 
20 by this section, the State Tax Assessor may impose penalties or take actions as provided 
21 in this chapter.  
22 D. Refunds of any overpayment of tax are governed by section 2011, except as follows:
23 (1) The State Tax Assessor shall first apply any overpayment of tax by a psilocybin 
24 service center operator to any tax imposed under this chapter that is owed by the 
25 psilocybin service center operator;
26 (2) If after any offset under subparagraph (1) the overpayment of tax remains 
27 greater than $1,000, the remaining refund must be applied as a credit against the 
28 next subsequent calendar quarter as an estimated payment; and
29 (3) The State Tax Assessor may not make a refund of, or credit, any overpayment 
30 of tax that was credited to the account of a psilocybin service center operator under 
31 subparagraph (2) if the return for that tax period is not filed within 3 years after the 
32 due date of that return. 
33§4964. Psilocybin revenue estimate
34 Not later than 30 days before the beginning of each calendar quarter, the department 
35 shall forecast and prepare an estimate of the revenue that will be received during the 
36 remainder of the current biennium and subsequent 3 biennia pursuant to the tax imposed 
37 under this chapter.  The estimate may be made on the basis of all pertinent information 
38 available to the department. Upon making the estimate, the department shall report the 
39 estimate to the Office of Fiscal and Program Review and the State Tax Assessor.  The State 
40 Tax Assessor shall provide the department any information necessary for the department 
41 to perform its duties under this section.

10 Tax Assessor may require any or all of the officers or employees who may be held 
11 liable to appear before the State Tax Assessor for a joint determination of liability. The 
12 State Tax Assessor shall notify each officer or employee of the time and place set for 
13 the determination of liability.  Each person notified of a joint determination under this 
14 subsection shall appear and present such information as is necessary to establish that 
15 person's liability or nonliability for payment of taxes to the State Tax Assessor.  If a 
16 person who was notified fails to appear, the State Tax Assessor shall make its 
17 determination on the basis of all the information and evidence presented. The

20 pursuant to Title 5, section 11001.
21 B. If an appeal is taken from the decision of the State Tax Assessor by any person 
22 determined to be liable for unpaid taxes under this subsection, each person required to 
23 appear before the department under this subsection must be impleaded by the plaintiff.  
24 The State Tax Assessor may implead any officer or employee who may be held jointly 
25 and severally liable for the payment of taxes.  Each person impleaded under this 
26 subsection must be made a party to the action and shall make available to all parties in 
27 the appeal the information that was presented to the State Tax Assessor. The court may 
28 determine that one or more persons impleaded under this subsection are liable for 
29 unpaid taxes without regard to any earlier determination by the State Tax Assessor that 
30 an impleaded person was not liable for unpaid taxes.
31 C. If a person required to appear before the court on appeal fails or refuses to appear 
32 or bring required information in part or in whole, or is outside the jurisdiction of the 
33 court, the court shall make its determination on the basis of all the evidence introduced.  
34 All evidence presented in the court constitutes a public record and must be available to 
35 the parties and the court.  The determination of the court is binding on all persons made 
36 parties to the action under this subsection.
37 D. This subsection does not preclude a determination by the State Tax Assessor or the 
38 court on appeal that more than one officer or employee are jointly and severally liable 
39 for unpaid taxes.

44 section 135 or for as long as the psilocybin service center operator retains the psilocybin 
Page 34 - 131LR0311(01)45 products to which the record relates, whichever is later.  During the retention period and at 
46 any time prior to the destruction of records, the State Tax Assessor may give written notice 
47 to the psilocybin service center operator not to destroy records described in the notice 
48 without written permission of the State Tax Assessor. Notwithstanding any provision of 
49 law to the contrary, the State Tax Assessor shall preserve reports and returns filed with the 
50 department for at least 5 years.
7§4967. Disclosure of information

9 disclose information received under this chapter to the department as necessary for the 
10 department to carry out the provisions of Title 28-B, chapter 5.
11§4968. Right to appeal determination of tax liability
12 Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or chapter 7, a final determination of tax 
13 liability by the State Tax Assessor under this chapter is a final agency action that may be 
14 appealed for review pursuant to Title 5, section 11001.
15§4969. Duty to return excess tax collected
16 When an amount represented by a psilocybin service center operator at retail to a client 
17 as constituting the tax imposed under this chapter is computed upon an amount that is not 
18 taxable or is in excess of the taxable amount and is actually paid by the client to the 
19 psilocybin service center operator, the excess tax paid must be returned by the psilocybin 
20 service center operator to the client upon written notification by the State Tax Assessor or 
21 the client.  The written notification must contain information necessary to determine the 
22 validity of the client's claim.  If the psilocybin service center operator does not return the 
23 excess tax within 60 days after the mailing of the written notification, the client may appeal 
24 to the State Tax Assessor for a refund of the amount of the excess tax, in the manner and 
25 within the time allowed under rules adopted by the State Tax Assessor.  If excess tax is 
26 returned to the client by the State Tax Assessor, the assessor may issue a notice of 
27 deficiency for the excess tax to the psilocybin service center operator.

39 a nonlapsing administrative account.  The State Tax Assessor may pay expenses for the 
40 administration and enforcement of this chapter from the account.  After the payment of 
41 administrative and enforcement expenses and refunds or credits arising from erroneous 
42 overpayments, the State Tax Assessor shall transfer on a quarterly basis the balance of the 
43 funds to the Psilocybin Control and Regulation Fund. 1
