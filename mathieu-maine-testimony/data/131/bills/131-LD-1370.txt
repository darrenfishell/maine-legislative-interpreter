Page 1 - 131LR1374(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §1486, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 171, §3, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Budget validation.  Following development of the annual regional school unit 
5 budget and approval at a regional school unit budget meeting as provided in section 1485, 
6 a referendum must be held in the regional school unit as provided in this section to allow 
7 the voters to validate or reject the total budget adopted at the regional school unit budget 
8 meeting.
9 Every 3 years, the voters in a regional school unit shall consider continued use of the budget 
10 validation referendum process.  The warrant at the budget validation referendum in the 3rd 
11 year following adoption or continuation of the referendum process must include an article 
12 by which the voters of the school administrative unit may indicate whether they wish to 
13 continue the process for another 3 years.  The warrant for the referendum to validate the 
14 fiscal year 2010-11 budget is deemed the 3rd-year warrant.  The vote on the question of 
15 whether to continue the budget validation referendum process must take place on the next 
16 general election date in November of the 3rd year following the previous vote on that 
17 question.  A vote to continue retains the process for 3 additional years.  A vote to 
18 discontinue the process ends its use beginning with the following budget year and prohibits 
19 its reconsideration for at least 3 years.
20 An article to consider reinstatement of the budget validation referendum process may be 
21 placed on a warrant for a referendum vote by either a majority vote of the regional school 
22 unit board or a written petition filed with the regional school unit board by at least 10%  
23 25% of the number of voters voting in the last gubernatorial election in the municipalities 
24 in the school administrative unit.  The regional school unit board shall place the article on 
25 the next scheduled warrant or an earlier one if determined appropriate by the regional 
26 school unit board.  The regional school unit board shall place the article on the ballot of the 
27 next general election date in November.  If adopted by the voters, the budget validation 
28 referendum process takes effect beginning in the next budget year or the following budget 
29 year if the adoption occurs less than 90 days before the start of the next budget year.  Once 
30 approved by the voters, the budget validation referendum process may not be changed for 
31 3 years.
32Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §1486, sub-§3, ¶H is enacted to read:
33 H.  A vote on a budget validation referendum may not be considered valid unless the 
34 number of voters voting on the referendum is equal to or greater than 25% of the total 
35 number of voters who voted in the last gubernatorial election in the area covered by 
36 the regional school unit seeking the budget validation.  If the number of voters voting 
37 on the referendum is less than 25% of the total number of voters who voted in the last 
38 gubernatorial election in the area covered by the regional school unit seeking the budget 
39 validation, the budget is considered to be approved.

45 reinstatement of a budget validation referendum process from 10% to 25% of the number

47 administrative unit and requires that the regional school unit board place the article on the 
48 ballot of the next general election date in November following the applicable regional 
49 school unit board vote or petition.  A vote on a budget validation referendum may not be 
50 considered valid unless the number of voters voting on the referendum is equal to or greater
