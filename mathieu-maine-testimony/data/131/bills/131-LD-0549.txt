6Sec. 2.  24 MRSA §2902, first ¶, as amended by PL 2013, c. 329, §2, is further 
7 amended to read:
8 Except as provided in section 2902‑B, actions  Actions for professional negligence must 
9 be commenced within 3 years after the cause of action accrues.  For the purposes of this 
10 section, a cause of action accrues on the date of the act or omission giving rise to the injury  
11 when the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered the harm. 
12 Notwithstanding the provisions of Title 14, section 853, relating to minority, actions for 
13 professional negligence by a minor must be commenced within 6 years after the cause of 
14 action accrues or within 3 years after the minor reaches the age of majority, whichever first 
15 occurs. This section does not apply  when the cause of action is based upon the leaving of 
16 a foreign object in the body, in which case the cause of action  accrues when the plaintiff 
17 discovers or reasonably should have discovered the harm.  For the purposes of this section, 
18 the term "foreign object" does not include a chemical compound, prosthetic aid or object 
19 intentionally implanted or permitted to remain in the patient's body as a part of the health 
20 care or professional services.
21SUMMARY
22 Under current law, the statute of limitations on a medical malpractice claim begins to 
23 run on the date of the act or omission that gave rise to the injury, unless the medical 
24 malpractice claim is based on the leaving of a foreign object in the body.  The statute of 
25 limitations does not begin to run on a medical malpractice claim based on the leaving of a 
26 foreign object in the body until the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered 
27 the harm.  
28 This bill provides that the statute of limitations does not begin to run on any medical 
29 malpractice claim, regardless of whether the claim is based on the leaving of a foreign 
30 object in the body, until the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered the 
31 harm.
32 The bill also makes a technical change to remove an obsolete cross-reference in the 
33 law.22
