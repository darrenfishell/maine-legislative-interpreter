Page 1 - 131LR0420(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §490-MM, sub-§3-A is enacted to read:
33-A.  Cement.  "Cement" means any of various calcined mixtures of clay and 
4 limestone, which can be mixed with water and used as an ingredient in making mortar or 
5 concrete.
6Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §490-MM, sub-§8, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 653, §23 and 
7 affected by §33, is amended to read:
88.  Metallic mineral.  "Metallic mineral" means any mineral, ore or  excavated material  
9 to be excavated from the natural deposits on or in the earth for its metallic mineral content 
10 to be used for commercial or industrial purposes. "Metallic mineral" does not include 
11 thorium or uranium  that has metal or a metalloid element as its economically valuable 
12 constituent, regardless of the chemical end product of the metal or metalloid element.
13Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §490-MM, sub-§11, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 653, §23 and 
14 affected by §33, is amended to read:
1511.  Mining.  "Mining," "mining operation" or "mining activity" means activities, 
16 facilities or processes necessary for the extraction or removal of metallic minerals or 
17 overburden or for the preparation, washing, cleaning or other treatment of metallic minerals 
18 and includes the bulk sampling, advanced exploration, extraction or beneficiation of 
19 metallic minerals as well as waste storage and other stockpiles and reclamation activities, 
20 but does not include exploration. "Mining," "mining operation" or "mining activity" does 
21 not include calcium carbonate or limestone extraction or beneficiation to produce cement.
22Sec. 4.  38 MRSA §490-OO, sub-§4, ¶D, as amended by PL 2017, c. 142, §7, is 
23 further amended by amending the first blocked paragraph to read:
24 In determining compliance with this standard, the department shall require 
25 groundwater monitoring consistent with the standards established pursuant to section 
26 490‑QQ, subsection 3, except that facilities that crush and mechanically sort material 
27 excavated from an open-pit mining operation that has a permit in good standing under 
28 this article are exempt from the requirements of section 490-QQ as long as the crushing, 
29 sorting, storage, loading and unloading of the material takes place in a building or 
30 shelter that prevents rain, snow, snowmelt, ice melt and runoff from commingling with 
31 the material.
32Sec. 5.  38 MRSA §490-OO, sub-§4, ¶O, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 142, §8, is 
33 amended to read:
34 O.  The mining operation will not use open-pit mining, except that the mining operation 
35 may use open-pit mining if the mining operation will only generate mine waste that 
36 does not have the potential to create acid rock drainage, alkali rock drainage or metal 
37 mine drainage, or does not violate water quality standards other than sedimentation and 
38 turbidity.
39Sec. 6.  38 MRSA §490-QQ, sub-§4, ¶E is enacted to read:
40 E.  For the reclamation of the open-pit area of an open-pit mining operation:
Page 2 - 131LR0420(01)1 (1) Highwalls or quarry faces must be treated in such a manner as to leave them in 
2 a condition that minimizes the possibility of rock falls, slope failures and collapse. 
3 A highwall that is loose must be controlled by the use of blasting or scaling, the 
4 use of safety benches, the use of flatter slopes or reduced face heights or the use of 
5 benching near the top of the face or rounding the edge of the face;
6 (2) Topsoil that is stripped or removed must be stockpiled and stabilized 
7 adequately for use in reclaiming disturbed lands appropriately to the approved final 
8 land use; 
9 (3) Native vegetation appropriate to the approved final land use must be established 
10 on all affected land, including safety benches, except for quarry walls and flooded 
11 areas;  
12 (4) Safe ingress and egress to water bodies must be provided for people and wildlife 
13 after reclamation;
14 (5) Intermittent and perennial streams diverted during mining activity must be 
15 returned to original channels or, if the original channel has been disturbed or 
16 destroyed, to a reconstructed channel having grades, pools, substrate, floodplains 
17 and meanders comparable to baseline conditions; and
18 (6) The actively mined, not reclaimed portion of the open pit may not exceed 100 
19 acres at any one time.
20 The department shall adopt rules establishing additional standards for the reclamation 
21 of the open-pit area of an open-pit mining operation.
22SUMMARY
23 This bill amends the definition of "metallic mineral" in the Maine Metallic Mineral 
24 Mining Act.  It provides that mining does not include calcium carbonate or limestone 
25 extraction or beneficiation to produce cement.  It provides that permitted facilities that 
26 crush and mechanically sort material excavated from an open-pit mining operation are 
27 exempt from the performance, operation and reclamation standards in the Maine Metallic 
28 Mineral Mining Act under certain conditions.  It allows the use of open-pit mining if certain 
29 conditions are met and establishes standards for the reclamation of the open-pit area of an 
30 open-pit mining operation.23
