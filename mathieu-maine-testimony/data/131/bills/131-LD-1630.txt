12 penalties in accordance with section 1016-G, subsection 3.
13Sec. 2.  1 MRSA §1016-G, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2019, c. 534, §5, is further 
14 amended to read:
153.  Penalties.  Penalties for violations of this section are as follows.
16 A.  Failing to file a statement within 15 days of having been notified by the commission 
17 is subject to a civil violation for which a fine of not more than $100 may be adjudged  
18 penalty not to exceed $500 payable to the commission.  A statement is not considered 
19 filed unless it substantially conforms to the requirements of this subchapter and is 
20 properly signed. The commission shall determine whether a statement substantially 
21 conforms to the requirements of this subchapter.
22 B.  The intentional filing of a false statement is a Class E crime. If the commission 
23 concludes that it appears that a Legislator has willfully filed a false statement, it shall 
24 refer its findings of fact to the Attorney General.  If the commission determines that a 
25 Legislator has willfully failed to file a statement required by this subchapter or has 
26 willfully filed a false statement, the Legislator is presumed to have a conflict of interest 
27 on every question.
28 Within 3 business days of a filing deadline, the commission shall mail a notice to a 
29 Legislator or candidate who has failed to file a statement required under this subchapter. If 
30 a Legislator or candidate does not file the statement within 15 days of the notice, the 
31 commission shall mail a notice of a preliminary penalty of $500 pursuant to paragraph A. 
32 The Legislator or candidate may request a waiver of the penalty within 15 days of the 
33 penalty notice. If no request is made, the preliminary $500 penalty is final. If the Legislator 
34 or candidate requests a waiver, the commission shall consider the request at its next meeting 
35 for a determination of the final penalty, if any. The commission staff shall confirm a final 
36 penalty in a written determination to the Legislator or candidate who did not file the 
37 statement on time. The commission's determination may be appealed to the Superior Court 
38 in accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 7 and the Maine Rules of Civil 
39 Procedure, Rule 80C. Penalties assessed pursuant to this subsection may be enforced in 
40 accordance with Title 21-A, section 1004-B.
41Sec. 3.  3 MRSA §319, sub-§1, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 179, §7, is

3 payable to the commission, of $100 for every month the person fails to register or is 
4 delinquent in filing a report pursuant to section 317.  If a registration or report is filed late, 
5 the commission shall send a notice of the finding of violation and preliminary penalty.  The 
6 notice must provide the lobbyist with an opportunity to request a waiver of the preliminary 
7 penalty.  If a lobbyist files a report required pursuant to section 317 within 24 hours after 
8 the deadline, the amount of the preliminary penalty is $50.  The preliminary penalty is 
9 increased by $50 for each successive violation during a lobbying year.  The commission 
10 may waive the fine or penalty in whole or in part if the commission determines the failure 
11 to register or report was due to mitigating circumstances or the fine or penalty is 
12 disproportionate to the level of experience of the lobbyist or the harm suffered by the public 
13 from the late registration or report.  For purposes of this subsection, "mitigating 
14 circumstances" means:
15 A.  A valid emergency determined by the commission, in the interest of the sound 
16 administration of justice, to warrant the waiver of the fine or penalty in whole or in 
17 part;
18 B.  An error by the commission; or
19 C.  Circumstances determined by the commission to warrant the waiver of the fine or 
20 penalty in whole or in part, based upon relevant evidence presented that a bona fide 
21 effort was made to file the report in accordance with this chapter, including, but not 
22 limited to, unexplained delays in Internet service.
