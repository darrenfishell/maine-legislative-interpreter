22 the department shall provide the following written information to the parent:
23 A. That the qualified student is not eligible to continue to receive money pursuant to 
24 this chapter unless the results of an individualized education program conducted 
25 pursuant to this subsection demonstrate that the qualified student meets the eligibility 
26 criteria prescribed in the individualized education program;
27 B. That the parent is entitled to obtain an individualized education program pursuant 
28 to this subsection to determine whether the qualified student meets the eligibility 
29 criteria prescribed in the individualized education program; and
30 C. A list of independent evaluation teams that meet the minimum qualifications 
31 prescribed by the department.

36Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §15689, sub-§17 is enacted to read:
3717.  Adjustment for empowerment scholarship accounts.  The commissioner shall 
38 reduce the state share of the total allocation to a school administrative unit in any year in 
39 which one or more empowerment scholarship accounts under section 9943 are established 
40 for students within that school administrative unit.  The amount of the reduction must equal 
41 the total state subsidy that is attributable to all students in that school administrative unit 
42 for whom empowerment scholarship accounts have been established, as determined by the 
43 department pursuant to section 9943, subsection 1.
Page 6 - 131LR0572(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill directs the Treasurer of State to establish and the Department of Education to 
3 administer individual empowerment scholarship accounts, based on similar accounts 
4 established in the state of Arizona, which may be used by parents to pay for the education 
5 of their children outside of the public school system, including private schools, online 
6 schools or home instruction. The funding for these empowerment scholarship accounts 
7 comes from shifting 90% of the essential programs and services funding that would 
8 otherwise be provided by the State and by the school administrative unit for each child into 
9 an empowerment scholarship account. The bill specifies what educational expenditures are 
10 permitted, including additional expenditures for children with disabilities, and provides for 
11 review of spending from the accounts.2
