5§2150-M.  Definitions
6 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
7 have the following meanings.
81.  Ambulance service provider. "Ambulance service provider" means a person that 
9 holds itself out to be a provider of transportation of ill or injured persons or that routinely 
10 provides transportation for ill or injured persons and is licensed under Title 32, chapter 2-B. 
11 "Ambulance service provider" does not include:
12 A. The Maine Army National Guard, the Maine Air National Guard or the United 
13 States Armed Forces; 
14 B. A municipal fire or police department or any other governmental entity that provides 
15 emergency ambulance services; 
16 C. An entity that exclusively provides air ambulance services; or
17 D. An organization that is required to pay any tax under Title 36, Part 4.
182.  Fee. "Fee" means the ambulance service assessment fee authorized by this chapter.
193.  Fund. "Fund" means the ambulance fee fund established in section 2150-O.
204.  Emergency ambulance services.  "Emergency ambulance services" means any 
21 services delivered by an ambulance service provider.
225.  Net operating revenue. "Net operating revenue" means gross revenue collected by 
23 an ambulance service provider for the delivery of emergency ambulance services less any 
24 deducted amounts for bad debts, charity care or payer discounts. 
25§2150-N.  Ambulance service assessment fee
261.  Fee established. The department shall charge every ambulance service provider a 
27 uniform ambulance service assessment fee. The fee must be assessed on each ambulance 
28 service provider's net operating revenue at a rate determined annually by the department. 
29 The rate must be calculated in a manner in which the assessment generates the state share 
30 necessary to fund the payments described in section 2150-O as long as the fee does not 
31 exceed the maximum limit allowable under 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 
32 433.68(f). The department shall establish each ambulance service provider's fee using the 
33 most recent data available as determined by the department in consultation with a statewide 
34 organization representing ambulance service providers and shall update each ambulance 
35 service provider's fee amount on a periodic basis, but at least annually. All emergency 
36 ambulance services, regardless of payer, are subject to the fee, including, but not limited 
37 to, emergency ambulance services provided by ambulance service providers under fee-for-
38 service and managed care arrangements. An ambulance service provider's liability for the 
Page 2 - 131LR0494(01)39 fee must, in the case of a transfer of ownership, be assumed by the successor in interest to 
40 the ambulance service provider. 
32.  Federal approval required.  The department may charge the fee only if the 
4 department has received approval from the federal Department of Health and Human 
5 Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services necessary to authorize the Medicaid 
6 payments to ambulance service providers in accordance with section 2150-O. 
73.  Deposit of fees.  The funds generated from the fee must be deposited into the fund 
8 and may be used only in accordance with that section. Funds generated from the fee do not 
9 revert to the General Fund and must be available for expenditure in subsequent fiscal years.
10§2150-O.  Ambulance fee fund
111.  Fund created. The ambulance fee fund is established as a separate nonlapsing fund 
12 within the department. 
132.  Source of funds. Amounts credited to the fund must be expended for payments to 
14 ambulance service providers under the MaineCare program. The following sources of 
15 income must be credited to the fund: 
16 A. All revenues generated from the fee;
17 B. An amount equal to any federal financial participation revenues claimed and 
18 received by the State for eligible expenditures made from the fund; 
19 C. Any revenue from appropriations or allocated by the Legislature and specifically 
20 designated to be credited to the fund; and 
21 D. Interest earned on any money in the fund. 
223. Federal funds.  The department shall seek federal funds to achieve the maximum 
23 amount of federal funding in a manner in which the assessment amount equals the state 
24 share under section 2150-N, subsection 1. The expenditures from the fund must be made 
25 by the department in a manner consistent with the requirements and conditions of 42 United 
26 States Code, Section 1396b(w) and 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 433.68 and 
27 may be made only under federally approved payment methods, consistent with federal 
28 funding requirements and consistent with all federal payment limits.
294.  Use of funds. Amounts in the fund must be expended exclusively for reimbursing 
30 ambulance service providers under the MaineCare program and must be used to 
31 supplement, not supplant, General Fund appropriations to support emergency ambulance 
32 service reimbursements as of October 1, 2023. Amounts in the fund may not be used to 
33 replace payment commitments between the ambulance service providers and the State. The 
34 reimbursement amounts established and distributed under the MaineCare program under 
35 this section must increase the total reimbursement amount for emergency ambulance 
36 services up to the average commercial rate to the extent permitted by the amount of funds 
37 generated from the fee. Reimbursement payments must be made to ambulance service 
38 providers at least on a quarterly basis. 
395.  Federal approval.  If the federal Department of Health and Human Services, 
40 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not authorize or withdraws approval of 
41 the Medicaid payments made to ambulance service providers in accordance with this 
42 section, all money in the fund must be returned to ambulance service providers. If the 1
2
Page 3 - 131LR0494(01)43 department no longer collects the fee, all money in the fund must be returned to ambulance 
44 service providers.
3§2150-P.  Rules
4 The department shall adopt rules to implement this chapter.  In adopting rules under 
5 this section, the department shall consult with relevant stakeholders, including a statewide 
6 organization representing ambulance service providers.
7§2150-Q.  Additional funding mechanisms
8 The department shall implement voluntary programs to increase funding to 
9 governmental ambulance service providers, including, but not limited to, 
10 intragovernmental transfer or certified public expenditure programs, to the extent allowed 
11 under Section 1903(w)(6) of the United States Social Security Act.
12Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §3174-JJ, as amended by PL 2019, c. 530, Pt. B, §1, is further 
13 amended to read:

24 critical care transport services under Medicare.  Beginning January 1, 2024, the department 
25 shall reimburse for:

36 licensed providers at a rate that is not less than 100% of the average allowable basic life
