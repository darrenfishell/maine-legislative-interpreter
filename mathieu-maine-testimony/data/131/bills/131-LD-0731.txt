8SUMMARY
9 This bill repeals the provision of law that directs the Department of Public Safety, 
10 Gambling Control Board to award, through a competitive bidding process, one bidder the 
11 privilege to be licensed to conduct advance deposit wagering and instead allows 
12 commercial tracks, off-track betting facilities and multijurisdictional account wagering 
13 providers to obtain a license to conduct advance deposit wagering.  It requires advance 
14 deposit wagering licensees to remit 1% of in-state gross wagering income and 1% of out-
15 of-state gross wagering income to the board for distribution. The bill requires licensure of 
16 employees of advance deposit wagering licensees.9
