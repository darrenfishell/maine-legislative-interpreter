Page 1 - 131LR1050(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the State's system of care to serve those who need residential supports or 
4 long-term care is failing to meet the needs of the State's population, resulting in hospitalized 
5 patients using inpatient beds when they need lower levels of care; and
6Whereas, nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and other residential options that 
7 are intended to meet the needs of individuals who can no longer live safely at home are 
8 unable to provide adequate access as a result of the closure of facilities and reduced bed 
9 capacity due to financial and labor market pressures; and
10Whereas, Maine's laws governing residential supports have not been reviewed in over 
11 a decade; and
12Whereas, immediate review of the laws governing residential supports is necessary 
13 in order to prevent more facility closures and bed capacity reduction; and
14Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
15 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
17 therefore, be it
