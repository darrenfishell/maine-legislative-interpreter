SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the maJonty report of the committee, strikes the prov1S1on 
of the bill that allows the Mame Human Rights Comm1ss1on to issue a nght-to-sue letter to 
a complamant on the 181 st day after a complamt is filed with the commission without 
receivmg a request for a right-to-sue letter from the complamant 
Instead, the amendment requires the commission to issue a right-to-sue letter to a 
complamant if the complamant submits a written request for a nght-to-sue letter more than 
180 days after filmg a complaint with the commission The amendment also authorizes the 
commission to issue a nght-to-sue letter to a complamant less than 180 days after the filing 
of a complaint 1f the complainant submits a request m writing and the executive director of 
the commission determmes that the complamant has demonstrated good cause for 
subm1ttmg an early request for a nght-to-sue letter and that it is probable that the 
commission will not be able to complete its mvest1gatlon within 180 days of the fihng of 
the complamt 
The amendment also requires the commission to end its mvesttgatlon whenever the 
commission issues a nght-to-sue letter to a complainant unless the executive director of the 
commission and legal counsel to the commission determme that proceedmg with the 
investigation would achieve the purposes of the Mame Human Rights Act If this 
determmation 1s made, the comm1ss10n must contmue to mvestigate the complamt as if it 
had onginally been filed by an employee of the comm1ss1on
