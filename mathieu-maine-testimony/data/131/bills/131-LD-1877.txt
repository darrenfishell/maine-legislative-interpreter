38 amount of monthly TANF assistance by an amount equal to 20% of the maximum

30 fuel necessary to participate in the activities agreed to in the family contract. 
31 Participants are eligible to receive the payments required under this paragraph upon the 
32 establishment of a family contract in which it is verified by the participant that the
