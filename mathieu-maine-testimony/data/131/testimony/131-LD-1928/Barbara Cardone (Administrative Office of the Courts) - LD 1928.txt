Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 1928, An Act to Protect 
Maine Taxpayers from Unconstitutional Federal Expenditures: 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Taxation, my name is Barbara Cardone and I am the Director of Legal Affairs and Public 
Relations for the Maine Judicial Branch. 
Although the Judicial Branch stands neither for nor against the policies in this bill, there 
is a judicial procedural ﬂaw that may render the bill ineffective. The procedure outlined in 
Section 1 of the bill is premised on the assumption that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court will 
render an opinion upon request as to whether a federal law is constitutional under the U.S. 
Constitution. That is not necessarily the case. 
The bill seems to presume that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court would always answera 
question if it were posed by the Legislature. This assumption itself is contrary to the Maine 
Constitution. Article VI, section 3 of the Maine Constitution provides that the Justices of the 
Court “shall be obliged to give their opinion upon important questions of law, and upon solemn 
occasions, when required by the Governor, Senate or House of Representatives." If the question 
does not present a “solemn occasion, ” the Court will not issue an advisory opinion. As the Court 
has explained, 
A solemn occasion arises when questions are of a serious and immediate nature, 
and the situation presents an unusual exigency. Such an exigency . . . exists when 
the body making the inquiry, having some action in view, has serious doubts as to 
its power and authority to take such action under the Constitution or under existing 
statutes. Only where the facts in support of the alleged solemn occasion are clear 
and compelling, will we determine that a solemn occasion exists. We will only 
answer questions that concern a matter of live gravity, and are sufficiently precise 
for the justices to be able to determine the exact nature of the inquiry.

Opinion of the Justices, 2015 ME 107 11 5, 123 A.3d 494 (quotation marks, citations, and 
alterations omitted). Thus, there is doubt Whether the Court would necessarily answer the 
question if asked under section 1051(1) of the bill.
