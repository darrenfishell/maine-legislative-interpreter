Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association 
In Opposition to 
LD 1 168, An Act to Aajust Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Rates 
April 26, 2023 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in opposition to LD 1168 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association ’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest. 
Although municipal ofﬁcials greatly appreciate the creativity found in LD 1168, Without 
fully comprehending the ﬁscal impacts, municipal ofﬁcials are hard pressed to support initiatives 
that seek to reduce the revenues available to fund state mandated and locally desired municipal 
programs and services. Considering that the Legislature is under no obligation to reimburse 
municipalities for the lost property tax revenue, any reduction in the excise tax revenues 
collected will either result an increase to the mil rate, and depending on the severity of the loss, 
could result in the reduction of services, or both reduced services and increased mil rates. 
As municipal leaders have previously observed, reducing the amount of revenue available 
to municipalities is troubling, as roads need to be plowed, solid waste needs to be managed, state 
laws need to be enforced and revenue collected and remitted to the state. Additionally, 
potentially shifting burdens onto homeowners seems to be in direct conﬂict with other state 
priorities focused on enabling seniors to age in place, as well as much needed workforce 
recruitment and retention efforts. 
Additionally, there this nothing in LD 1168 that protects the excise tax program from 
efforts to “gift” or establish sales prices that do not reﬂect the actual value of the vehicle. If the 
sales price is under $15,000, the excise taxes due would be the $5 minimum. 
For example, I own a 1998 Ford Ranger with a manufacturer ’s suggested retail price of 
$17,370 which my father “sold” to me for $1. Under the current system, I pay $69.48 in excise 
taxes. Under LD 1168, the excise tax obligation would drop to $23.70, unless of course I availed 
myself of the “gift” loophole, which would yield a payment of $5. 
Also missing from this proposal is reimbursement for the administrative burdens and 
costs associated with implementing the program. Unless the legislature envisions paying 
vendors for needed updates, software related costs will need to be absorbed by municipalities. 
If the state is truly interested in providing this level of tax relief, then the Legislature 
should ﬁnd the revenues, not otherwise committed to municipalities, to administer, implement 
and enforce the program. 
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue. If you have any 
questions about the Association ’s position on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at
