L.D. 1168 
Senator Grohaski, Representative Perry and members of the Taxation 
Committee. I'm David Kent from Standish. I'm a member of Maine Farm 
Bureau and President of Cumberland County Farm Bureau. I'm 
testifying today in opposition to L.D. 1168. 
The good part of this bill is it takes $15,000 off the MSRP. The bad part 
is that it increases the number of years from 6 to 10. it also mandates a 
Hugh increase in the mill rate each year over the 10-year period. 
I did a calculation on a $50,000 new vehicle comparing the present 
system to the proposed changes in L.D. 1168. The current rate resulted 
in an excise tax of $4575 over 10 years. The proposed changes in L.D. 
1168 results in an excise tax of $8120 over 10 years. This is a 77.5% tax 
increase. Therefore, Maine Farm Bureau and l strongly urge an ought 
not to pass vote on this bill. 
Thank you and I'll try to answer any questions.
