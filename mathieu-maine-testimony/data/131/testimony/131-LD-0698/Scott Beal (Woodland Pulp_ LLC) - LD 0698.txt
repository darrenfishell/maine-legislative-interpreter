Testimony of Scott Beal, Environmental & Security Manager for Woodland Pulp in 
Support of the proposed amendment of LD-698 -An Act to Reduce the Cost of Energy in 
Maine and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions Through the Effective Use of Bridge 
Fuels. 
March 9 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and members of the Energy, 
Utilities and Technology Committee. 
I’m Scott Beal, Environmental & Security Manager for Woodland Pulp, St. Croix Tissue, 
Inc. and St. Croix Chipping located in Baileyville. 
Gn behalf of the 469 women and men that work at out three companies, I appear before 
you today in support of the proposed amendment to LD-698, A/A to Reduce the Cost of 
Energy in Maine and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions Through the Effective Use of 
Bridge Fuels. 
Perhaps of little surprise to any of you on the committee, the cost of energy to power our 
mills is second only to the cost of our fiber supply. We stand in strong support of this 
measure as it seeks to Work regionally and in-state to expand the our natural gas 
infrastructure. 
Qver the past several years, we have experienced considerable volatility in the pricing of 
Natural Gas. Coupled with these price swings we experienced is the seemingly persistent 
regional disparity in pricing when compared to other regions in the U.S. 
I’ve been advised this disparity is caused, at least in part, because of pipeline constraints of 
bringing the fuel into the state of Maine. That said, it’s particularly encouraging to read in 
Representative Foster’s proposed amendment for the Commission to work with other 
New England States, interstate pipeline operators and other stakeholders to approach this 
effort collectively. 
I’ll close at this point and thank you for your time considering my testimony and am 
happy to try to answer any questions from the committee. 
Scott Beal
