Testimony of Huhtamaki Food Services 
R 
Before 
The Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Regarding Support of LD 698 
March 8, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and members of the 
Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. My name is Paul Serbent, andI 
work at Huhtamaki. Our Waterville plant employs 550 people and produces 
formed ﬁber packaging that is in demand as a.n alternative to foam and plastic 
based products. Huhtamaki is a larger energy consumer and is already burdened 
by high energy costs compared to our other plants in other regions of the country. 
In the past, we’ve had to idle machines and lay off employees during times of high 
electricity prices. 
That’s why I’m here today to voice support for LD 698. 
Similar to the Maine Energy cost Reduction Act enacted over IO years ago, this 
legislation seeks to resolve a root cause of high energy costs. The Maine Public 
Utilities Commission, ISO-New England, and the Department of Energy all agree 
that high energy costs are a result of high natural gas prices. Those prices are even 
higher in Maine and New England because of constrained pipeline capacity. 
Expanding major natural gas supply infrastructure into New England beneﬁts 
everyone by lowering energy costs—especially Maine’s large manufacturers. 
Huhtamaki is also committed to doing its part for the cIimate—that’s why the 
company has invested in energy efﬁciency and renewables. Expanding natural gas 
pipeline capacity in New England will allow Huhtamaki to secure savings through 
lower energy prices that it can continue investing in greenvenergy solutions and in 
its Maine facilities and workforce. 
I urge you to vote in support of LD 698, and thank you for considering this 
testimony.'
