Good
afternoon
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich
and
respected
colleagues
of
the
Joint 
Standing
Committee
on
Environmental
and
Natural
Resources.
My
name
is
Sophie
W arren,
and
I 
represent
House
district
124
which
includes
part
of
Scarborough.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity 
to
present
LD
1908,
An
Act
to
Enact
the
Safe
Cosmetics
Act.
I
will
begin
my
testimony
with
my
request
for
your
consideration
to
carry-over
this
bill
to
be 
heard
in
the
second
regular
session
in
2024.
The
reason
for
this
request
is
due
to
action
by
the 
federal
government
after
this
bill
title
was
put
into
the
Revisor's
Of fice.
The
Consolidated
Appropriations
Act
of
2023
was
signed
into
law
by
President
Biden
at
the 
beginning
of
the
year ,
and
positively ,
it
included
a
piece
of
legislation
titled
the
Modernization
of 
Cosmetics
Regulation
Act
of
2022
(MOCRA),
which
included
an
update
to
the
nationâ€™ s
cosmetic 
laws
by
amending
Chapter
VI
of
the
Federal
Food,
Drug,
and
Cosmetic
Act
(FD&C
Act).
This
act
made
parts
of
our
bill
redundant,
and
also
preempted
action
by
states
on
certain
other 
regulatory
labeling
legislation.
As
such,
I
have
worked
with
stakeholders
and
advocates
to
find
a
path
forward
with
this
Act
that 
works
with
this
important
federal
step
forward.
Carrying
this
bill
over
to
the
short
session
af fords
time
to
allow
the
public,
advocates,
the 
administration,
and
Committee
members
to
consider
and
provide
important
input,
amendment 
and
critique
to
the
bill
as
it
is
now
before
you,
to
ensure
this
lar ger
bill
can
be
fully
considered 
and
hopefully
passed
through
your
Committee
and
so
that
it
can
help
Maine
people
as
it
intends 
to
do. 
The
Safe
Cosmetics
Act
of
Maine
aims
to
protect
consumers
from
the
potential
harmful
ef fects 
of
certain
chemicals
commonly
used
in
cosmetic
products.
First,
the
Safe
Cosmetics
Act
of
Maine
prohibits
the
distribution,
sale,
or
of fering
for
sale
of 
cosmetic
products
that
contain
restricted
substances
as
intentionally
added
chemicals.
The 
restricted
substances
include
heavy
metals,
parabens,
phthalates,
formaldehyde,
benzophenones, 
known
carcinogens,
asbestos,
butylated
compounds,
siloxanes,
phenylenediamines,
and 
nitrosamines,
among
others.
This
regulation
ensures
that
cosmetic
products
available
in
Maine 
do
not
contain
these
harmful
substances
that
could
pose
risks
to
consumers'
health.

S c a r b o r o u g h

Second,
the
act
requires
manufacturers
to
provide
a
certificate
of
compliance
if
there
are 
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
cosmetic
product
contains
a
restricted
substance.
This 
certificate
attests
that
the
cosmetic
product
does
not
contain
any
restricted
substances
as 
intentionally
added
chemicals.
If
a
manufacturer
fails
to
provide
the
certificate,
they
are
required 
to
notify
retailers
in
the
state
that
the
sale
of
the
product
is
prohibited
and
provide
the 
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
with
a
list
of
notified
retailers.
By
prohibiting
the
intentional
use
of
restricted
substances
and
establishing
compliance
measures, 
the
act
seeks
to
ensure
the
safety
of
cosmetic
products
available
in
the
state.
Maine
can
take
an
important
step
to
regulate
toxic
chemicals
in
cosmetic
products
through
the 
enactment
of
the
Safe
Cosmetics
Act.
Moreover ,
such
consumer
protections
are
nothing
new
for 
the
state
of
Maine.
W e
have
a
strong
record
of
implementing
laws
which
regulate
chemicals
in 
consumer
products
and
have
been
demonstrably
shown
to
protect
public
health.
Just
a
few 
notable
examples
are:
1.
T oxic
Chemicals
in
Children's
Products:
Maine
has
enacted
the
Kid-Safe
Products
Act,
which 
requires
manufacturers
to
report
the
use
of
certain
chemicals
in
children's
products.
The
law 
identifies
chemicals
of
high
concern
and
establishes
a
reporting
mechanism
to
track
their 
presence
in
products
intended
for
children.
It
aims
to
reduce
children's
exposure
to
toxic 
substances
and
promote
safer
alternatives
in
consumer
goods.
2.
Safer
Chemicals
in
Packaging:
Maine
has
passed
the
Safer
Chemicals
in
Packaging
Law , 
which
restricts
the
use
of
toxic
chemicals
in
packaging
materials.
The
law
prohibits
the 
intentional
use
of
lead,
mercury ,
cadmium,
and
hexavalent
chromium
in
packaging
sold
or 
distributed
in
the
state.
It
aims
to
protect
public
health
and
the
environment
by
reducing
chemical 
exposures
from
packaging
materials.
3.
Phthalate
Restrictions:
Maine
has
implemented
restrictions
on
the
use
of
phthalates,
a
group
of 
chemicals
often
used
in
plastics,
vinyl,
and
personal
care
products.
The
state
prohibits
the
sale
of 
children's
products
containing
more
than
0.1%
of
certain
phthalates
known
as
DEHP ,
DBP ,
and 
BBP .
The
aim
is
to
protect
children
from
potential
health
risks
associated
with
these
chemicals, 
such
as
hormonal
disruption
and
developmental
issues.
4.
Flame
Retardant
Restrictions:
Maine
has
enacted
the
Flame
Retardant
Chemicals
in 
Upholstered
Furniture
and
Bedding
Law .
This
law
restricts
the
use
of
flame
retardant
chemicals 
in
residential
upholstered
furniture
and
bedding
products.
It
prohibits
the
sale
of
new
furniture 
and
bedding
that
contains
specific
flame
retardants
that
have
been
linked
to
adverse
health 
ef fects.
These
and
many
other
laws
and
regulations
demonstrate
Maine's
commitment
to
safeguarding 
public
health
and
the
environment
by
reducing
the
presence
of
toxic
chemicals
in
consumer 
products.
They
aim
to
encourage
the
use
of
safer
alternatives,
promote
transparency
in
product 
labeling,
and
limit
exposure
to
harmful
substances
for
both
adults
and
children.
By
enacting
the
Safe
Cosmetics
Act,
we
build
on
previous
important
work
our
state
has
done
to 
implement
specific
regulations
to
safeguard
consumers
from
the
potential
health
impacts
of
toxic 
chemicals
in
cosmetic
products.
These
regulations
aim
to
ensure
the
safety
and
well-being
of 
individuals
using
cosmetic
products
in
the
state
by
reducing
their
exposure
to
harmful 
substances.
D i s t r i c t
1 2 4 :
P a r t
o f
S c a r b o r o u g h
For
at
least
the
past
50
years,
cosmetic
products
sold
in
the
United
States
have
been
subject
to 
greater
scrutiny
for
their
association
with
various
health
impacts,
particularly
for
women
and 
girls,
in
the
United
States.
One
significant
concern
has
been
the
use
of
certain
chemicals
that 
have
been
linked
to
adverse
health
ef fects.
For
example,
some
cosmetics
contained
lead,
which 
was
found
to
cause
neurological
damage,
particularly
in
children
and
pregnant
women. 
Additionally ,
certain
hair
dyes
and
hair
straightening
products
were
found
to
contain
harmful 
chemicals
such
as
formaldehyde
and
coal
tar ,
which
have
been
associated
with
an
increased
risk 
of
cancer .
Moreover ,
the
presence
of
hormone-disrupting
substances
like
phthalates
and
parabens 
in
cosmetics
raised
concerns
about
their
potential
role
in
reproductive
disorders
and
hormonal 
imbalances.
T o
address
these
health
risks,
regulations,
and
restrictions
on
certain
chemicals
in
cosmetic 
products
have
played
a
crucial
role
in
mitigating
the
harms
faced
by
consumers.
For
instance,
the 
US
based
the
use
of
lead
in
cosmetic
products
and
set
limits
on
the
concentration
of
other
known 
harmful
substances.
Similarly ,
regulations
have
been
introduced
to
limit
the
use
of 
formaldehyde-releasing
preservatives
and
coal
tar
dyes
in
cosmetics.
These
regulatory
actions 
have
helped
protect
public
health
by
reducing
exposure
to
harmful
chemicals
and
preventing
the 
associated
health
impacts.
By
prioritizing
consumer
safety
and
implementing
stricter
standards, 
the
regulation
of
certain
chemicals
in
cosmetic
products
has
contributed
to
improving
the
overall 
consumer
well-being
and
public
trust
in
the
United
States.
T o
get
into
the
language
of
the
bill
itself,
I
want
to
review
each
section
briefly:
The
Safe 
Cosmetics
Act
seeks
to
regulate
the
use
of
certain
chemicals
in
cosmetic
products.
The
act
introduces
definitions
for
key
terms
and
establishes
restrictions
on
the
intentional
use
of 
restricted
substances
in
cosmetic
products.
These
definitions
include
"cosmetic
product,"
which
refers
to
an
article
intended
for
application 
on
the
human
body
to
enhance
appearance
or
alter
its
appearance.
It
also
defines
"intentionally 
added
chemical"
as
a
chemical
added
during
manufacturing
to
provide
specific
characteristics
or 
functions
to
the
product.
The
act
further
defines
"nonfunctional
by-product"
as
an
element
or
compound
intentionally 
added
during
the
manufacturing
process
but
has
no
functional
ef fect
in
the
final
product.
It
also 
covers
"nonfunctional
contaminants,"
which
are
unintentional
elements
or
compounds
that
have 
no
functional
ef fect
and
are
present
in
the
cosmetic
product
as
a
result
of
the
manufacturing 
process.
The
act
lists
a
comprehensive
set
of
restricted
substances
that
are
prohibited
as
intentionally 
added
chemicals
in
cosmetic
products.
These
substances
include
heavy
metals,
parabens, 
phthalates,
formaldehyde,
benzophenones,
known
carcinogens,
asbestos,
butylated
compounds, 
siloxanes,
phenylenediamines,
and
nitrosamines,
among
others.
According
to
the
act,
it
is
illegal
to
distribute,
sell,
or
of fer
for
sale
any
cosmetic
product
in 
Maine
that
contains
a
restricted
substance
as
an
intentionally
added
chemical,
even
if
it
is
present 
as
a
nonfunctional
by-product
or
nonfunctional
contaminant
above
the
practical
quantification 
limit.
The
practical
quantification
limit
refers
to
the
lowest
concentration
of
a
chemical
that
can 
be
reliably
measured
within
specified
limits
of
precision
during
routine
laboratory
conditions.
The
act
also
establishes
a
requirement
for
manufacturers
to
provide
a
certificate
of
compliance
if 
there
are
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
cosmetic
product
contains
a
restricted
substance. 
The
certificate
must
confirm
that
the
cosmetic
product
does
not
contain
any
restricted
substances
D i s t r i c t
1 2 4 :
P a r t
o f
S c a r b o r o u g h
as
intentionally
added
chemicals.
If
a
manufacturer
fails
to
provide
the
certificate,
they
must 
notify
retailers
in
the
state
that
the
sale
of
the
product
is
prohibited
and
provide
the
Department 
of
Health
and
Human
Services
with
a
list
of
notified
retailers.
The
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
is
authorized
to
adopt
rules
to
implement
the 
Safe
Cosmetics
Act,
and
these
rules
are
considered
routine
technical
rules.
Maine
can
take
these
important
steps
to
regulate
toxic
chemicals
in
cosmetic
products
through 
the
enactment
of
the
Safe
Cosmetics
Act
-
restrictions
on
the
intentional
use
of
certain
chemicals 
and
providing
guidelines
for
manufacturers
and
distributors
of
cosmetic
products
in
the
state.
The
goal
here
is
simple:
to
protect
consumers
from
the
potential
harmful
ef fects
of
certain 
chemicals
commonly
used
in
cosmetic
products.
By
prohibiting
the
intentional
use
of
restricted 
substances
and
establishing
compliance
measures,
the
act
seeks
to
ensure
the
safety
of
cosmetic 
products
available
in
the
state
which
is
a
goal
I
think
we
all
share.
I
appreciate
your
time
and
consideration
of
this
legislation
as
proposed,
as
well
as
your 
consideration
of
my
carry-over
request
at
this
time
of
public
hearing.
