ln Support of LD 1908 “An Act to Enact the Safe Cosmetics Act" 
Before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee 
May 15, 2023/ 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee My name IS Sarah Woodbury l am the director of advocacy for Defend 
Our Health Defend Our Health's mission is to make sure that everyone has equal access to 
safe food and drinking water, healthy homes and products that are toxic-free and climate 
friendly I am [here to testify in support of LD 1908 "An Act to Enact the Safe Cosmetics Act" 
LD 1908, modeled after similar legislation currenty making its way through the New York 
legislature, would ban the distribution and sale of cosmetics that contain certain intentionally 
added chemicals These chemicals can lead to health impacts such as breast and other 
cancers, birth defects, damage to the reproductive system, organ system toxicity and endocrine 
disruption Breast cancer and other chronic diseases have been increasing over the past 50 
years and this can be linked to the chemicals we are exposed to on a daily basis in cosmetics 
and other consumer products Industry will argue that small amounts of exposure to toxic 
chemicals in cosmetics is totally safe and this IS simply false For some of these chemicals, 
even small amounts are harmful, particularly to growing fetuses, infants, and children We must 
look at our toxic exposure more holistically A person is not jUS’[ exposed to something like 
phthalates in just our cosmetics They are found in more than just cosmetics to the exposure is 
compounded This goes for many of the chemicals on this list We should be doing all that we 
can to limit our exposure pathways and cosmetics is one such pathway 
Additionally, when you look at cosmetics marketed towards people of color, those cosmetics 
contain more hazardous chemicals than cosmetics targeted towards white people, adding to the 
already higher level of exposure to toxics for people of color According to a study by the 
American Joumal of Obstetrics and Gynecology “Compared with white women, women of color 
have higher levels of beauty product—related environmental chemicals in their bodies, 
independent of socioeconomic status "1 
Maine IS not the only state looking at banning toxic chemicals in cosmetics, along with New York 
state as mentioned above, Vermont and Oregon are looking at legislation to ban several 
chemicals in cosmetics, Washington state has a bill currently sitting on the Governor ’s desk,
