Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1895:
“An
Act
Regarding
the
Procurement
of
Energy
from
Offshore
Wind
Resources”
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities,
and
Technology,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
nonprofit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1895
.
Misguided
politicians
running
the
states
within
our
regional
electric
grid,
especially
in
Maine,
are
rejecting
reliable
base-load
power
sources
like
nuclear
and
hydroelectric
power
in
favor
of
intermittent,
unreliable
sources
like
wind
and
solar.
Fundamentally,
this
ethos
has
restricted
supply
and
led
to
New
Englanders
paying
the
second-highest
electricity
rates
in
the
nation.
1
Our
energy
policy
is
sorely
off-track.
Maine
ratepayers
are
still
reeling
from
two
record
year-over-year
rate
increases
since
2021,
2
face
yet
another
$9
monthly
hike
on
average
this
July,
and
are
hearing
more
incremental
increases
are
coming
to
fund
investments
by
Central
Maine
Power
(CMP)
into
the
grid.
3
Price
hikes
do
not
look
to
be
abating,
given
sustained
inflation
resulting
from
massive
federal
money-printing.
If
that
wasn’t
enough,
our
state
Public
Advocate
is
warning
that
well-intentioned
“green
energy”
programs
like
community
solar
will
make
the
situation
for
ratepayers
even
worse.
4
Meanwhile,
the
Mills
administration
is
openly
acknowledging
that
it
is
blocking
the
entrance
of
cheaper
power
into
the
market
in
favor
of
protecting
its
friends
in
the
biomass
industry.
5
And
now,
it
has
set
its
sights
on
propping
up
another
wasteful
energy
generation
source:
offshore
wind.
Wind
power
only
has
an
average
capacity
factor
of
35%,
meaning
wind
arrays
only
produce
energy
about
a
third
of
the
time.
Though
slightly
better
than
solar’s
25%
capacity
factor,
natural
gas
plants
are
double
that
of
wind,
and
nuclear
is
nearly
triple.
6
The
obvious
difference
is
that
natural
gas
and
nuclear
are
baseload
energy
sources,
and
without
them,
our
power
bills
would
be
much
higher
than
they
are
now.

The
graph
below
portrays
data
on
the
changing
mix
of
power
generation
sources
from
ISO-NE,
New
England’s
regional
grid
operator,
from
2000
to
2022.
At
first
glance,
a
few
things
become
apparent.
The
first
is
that
the
region
is
producing
significantly
less
power
in
recent
years
than
it
was
before
2014,
which
has
corresponded
with
greater
imports,
made
up
primarily
of
natural
gas
sources
from
New
York
and
hydroelectric
from
Quebec
and
New
Brunswick.
Other
takeaways
include
that
overall
power
generation
within
the
region
is
clearly
much
less
in
recent
years.
In-region
natural
gas
production
has
made
up
for
the
reductions
in
electricity
created
from
coal,
oil,
and
nuclear
power
generators,
but
two
nuclear
plants
have
closed
in
the
last
10
years,
and
following
two
more
closures
in
the
1990s.
One
may
ask,
“where
is
wind
power
in
all
this?”
While
wind
has
been
growing
as
a
generation
source,
in
2022,
it
made
up
less
than
4%
of
all
energy
produced
within
ISO-NE.
Amid
all
of
the
shifting
generation
sources
within
New
England,
wind
turbines
merely
made
up
for
the
reduction
in
burning
wood
for
power
over
the
years.
It
is
simply
not
a
feasible
substitute
for
reliable,
base
load
sources
like
natural
gas,
hydroelectric,
and
nuclear.
Since
it
is
costly
and
physically
difficult
to
store
energy
for
long
periods
of
time,
if
wind
turbines
and
solar
panels
generate
power
when
it
is
not
needed,
without
sufficient
battery
storage,
it
will
be
wasted.
Instead
of
banking
the
future
of
our
economic
stability

and
quality
of
life
on
unreliable
energy
sources
and
yet-to-be-developed
technology,
7
lawmakers
should
pursue
ways
to
expand
all
types
of
energy
production
in
Maine
through
a
level
playing
field,
not
more
carve-outs
for
politicians’
donors
and
their
favored
energy
projects.
Please
deem
LD
1895
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
spare
Mainers
from
this
misguided
plan
which
will
cost
Mainers
in
higher
fees,
taxes,
and
reduced
purchasing
power.
It
will
destabilize
our
energy
grid
and
hike
prices
even
further.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
