I am for LD 1895
I do not want wind energy at all because they are detrimental to all sea life during the 
process and hearing scale that BOEM  does not measure on. The electricity cables 
will cause harm and immobile crustaceans.  BOEM will tell you the seismic or sonar 
does not affect sea life.. but they are not using the same scale that sea co life actually 
uses. There are many farms in place that have already seen the affects. We need to 
learn by them. That being said.. if we have to have wind farmsâ€¦ they need to be 
outside of LMA1 because 80% of us rely on this income. This will be detrimental not 
only to Maine but to the government who will have to support communities like mine 
that travel long distances to even get to a MCdonalds or any kind of restaurant.
