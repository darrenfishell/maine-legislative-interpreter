Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler,
and
Honorable
Members
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities,
and
Technology.
My
name
is
Anna
Siegel,
and
I
write
as
a
representative
of
Maine
Youth
Action,
where
our
goal
is
to
ﬁght
for
bold,
equitable
and
intersectional
climate
policy
in
Maine
on
a
state
and
municipal
level
through
youth
voice,
power
and
action.
To
achieve
this,
Maine
Youth
Action
works
with
the
Maine
legislature
to
pass
environmental
bills,
as
well
as
working
to
elect
candidates
to
the
legislature
who
will
be
climate
champions.
Maine
Youth
Action
is
a
youth-led
organization
that
is
open
to
anyone
under
the
age
of
thirty.
We
believe
that
L.D.
1895
is
an
important
step
forward
for
a
livable
future.
Establishing
the
Maine
Offshore
Wind
Renewable
Energy
and
Economic
Development
Program
with
L.D.
1895
would
undoubtedly
advance
Maine’s
renewable
energy
goals
outlined
in
the
“Maine
Won’t
Wait”
Climate
Action
Plan.
This
bill
reﬂects
the
needs
of
a
changing
world
with
language
surrounding
economic
justice,
ecological
management,
and
the
urgency
of
the
climate
crisis.
The
emphasis
in
the
bill
on
diversity,
justice,
and
inclusion
in
the
local
hiring
and
competitive
solicitation
that
would
result
from
L.D.
1895
is
important
for
the
just
transition
from
fossil
fuels
to
renewable
energy.
The
bill
also
highlights
the
mitigation
and
monitoring
of
the
natural
environment
surrounding
offshore
wind
installations.
This
is
essential
to
preserve
the
ecology
in
the
short-term
that
renewable
energy
such
as
offshore
wind
would
preserve
in
the
long-term.
There
is
a
narrative
around
renewable
energy
projects,
wind
turbines
in
particular,
about
how
detrimental
they
are
to
migrating
and
resident
bird
species.
Yet
avian
fatalities
from
wind
turbines
are
often
exaggerated
as
a
talking
point
in
opposition
to
these
turbines.
In
reality,
millions
more
bird
deaths
occur
because
of
collisions
with
fossil
fuel
power
plants,
as
found
by
a
2009
study
.
Furthermore,
there
are
simple
solutions
to
reduce
the
number
of
deaths
that
do
occur.
A
2020
study
conducted
by
the
Norwegian
Institute
for
Nature
Research
found
that

painting
one
blade
of
a
wind
turbine
black
can
reduce
avian
fatalities
near
turbines
by
over
70%.
Renewable
energy
is
crucial
for
a
livable
world,
today
and
in
the
future.
Maine
is
uniquely
poised
for
offshore
wind
and
the
state
must
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity.
Maine
Youth
Action
urges
you
to
vote
ought-to-pass
on
L.D.
1895.
