RE Support of LD 1895, An Act Regardlng the Procurement of Energy from Offshore 
Wmd Resources 
Dear Senator Lawrence, Representatlve Zelgler, and other members of the Commlttee, 
My name 15 Steve Clemmer, Dlrector of Energy Research 1n the Unron of Concemed 
Screntrsts (UCS) Clnnate and Energy Program, and I l1ve 1n Prospect Harbor Mame UCS 1s 
the nat1on’s leadmg sclence based non-proﬁt organlzatron w1th more than a half a m1ll1on 
supporters, mcludrng more than 2,500 1n Mame I offer th1s testrmony 1n support of the 
Sponsor’s Amendment to LD 1895 
LD l895’s procurement targets for offshore w1nd are cr1t1cal for meet1ng Ma1ne’s cl1mate and 
energy goals, whrle helpmg to stab1l1ze energy costs, create hrgh qual1ty ]0bS, and ensure 
development rs responslble and equrtable 
LD 1895 burlds on the recommendatlons from Ma1ne’s Offshore Wmd Roadmap and pol1c1es 
adopted 1n other leadrng states The roadmap was developed over the past two years by the 
Govemor’s Energy Ofﬁce based on extenslve mput from a w1de range of stakeholders Asa 
member of the Energy Markets and Strategles Workmg Group for the roadmap, I can tell you 
that adoptmg a procurement requrrement for offshore w1nd development 1n Mame was the 
workrng group’s hlghest pr1or1ty recommendatlon 
Here are ﬁve reasons why LD 1895 1s so lmportant for Mame 
Offshore wmd as crmcal for meetmg Mame’s clzmate and clean energy goals 
Clrmate change 1s one of the brggest threats to Ma1ne’s envrromnent and economy As 
descrrbed 1n Ma1ne’s Clrmate Actlon Plan, the Gulf of Mame 1s wanmng faster than 99% of 
the world’s oceans Increasmg ocean acrdlﬁcatlon 1s also harmmg Ma1ne’s lobster and ﬁshmg 
lndustry, wh1le warrnmg waters and temperatures are dnvmg specres further north Coastal 
communltles are already experrencmg the lmpaots of coastal ﬂoodlng due to sea level r1se 
and stronger storms fueled by clrmate change, whrch are pI‘0_]6Ct6d to get worse over trme 
To l1m1t the worst lmpacts of clunate change, recent S1ILldl6S by the Intergovemmental Panel 
on Clunate Change (IPCC) show that we need to cut global heat-trappmg em1ss1ons 1n half by 
Punted on 100% past eomumcl recycled paper
2030 and reach net zero emrssrons economy-wrde no later than 2050 1 
Multrple studres also 
show that ach1ev1ng these targets w1ll requ1re decarbomzlng the power sector as soon as 
possrble and replacmg fossrl fuels w1th zero-carbon electr1c1ty 1n transportauon, burldmgs, 
and mdustry 
Ma1ne’s clrmate and clean energy laws are well-alrgned wrth these scrence-based targets and 
strategles, as descnbed 1n Ma1ne’s Chmate Actron Plan, wh1chI helped shape as a member of 
the Energy Workmg Group A recent UCS report shows that Marne has one of the strongest 
chmate actlon plans 1n New England2 
Offshore wmd development w1ll be cr1t1cal for meetrng state and regronal chmate and clean 
energy requrrements Recent studres show that offshore wrnd development 1n Mame could 
range from 500 megawatts (MW) to 1,000 MW 1n 2030 to 5,000 MW to 8,000 MW by 20503 
Wrth 2,800 MW 1nstalled and operat1ng by 2040, offshore wmd would provlde more than 
half of Ma1ne’s electncrty demand, even wrth demand more than doublmg as 1s projected 
when the state moves to replace fossrl fuels w1th clean electrrcrty for transportatron and 
heatrng 
Procurement targets are a proven and effective strategy 
More than two decades of adoptmg and 1mplement1ng renewable electnclty standards 1n 30 
states shows that procurement targets have been a key drrver for deploymg land-based wmd 
and solar, achlevlng economres of scale, lncreasmg technology mnovatron, and lowermg 
costs 4 
By adoptmg a procurement requlrement, Ma1ne w1ll have a much better chance to 
compete 1n the race w1th other states to develop offshore wrnd and related supply chaln 
rnfrastructure 1n the US 
At least 10 other states, mcludmg s1x states lI1 the Northeast, have adopted offshore wmd 
procurement targets totalmg 81,000 MW over the next 20 years, accordmg to the Amencan 
Clean Power Assoclatron 5 These targets range from 1,400 MW by 2030 1n Rhode Island to 
11,000 MW by 2040 rn New Jersey to 25,000 MW by 2045 1n Calrforma (see Exh1b1t A)

Whrle the 2,800 MW by 2035 procurement target 1n LD 1895 rs more modest, most of the 
other states wrth hrgher targets have much larger populatrons and greater energy demand 
Most states also have rnterrm targets that ramp-up over trme, whrch grves the rndustry more 
rnvestment oertarnty and wrll be necessary to burld out the offshore wrnd supply charn 
Accordrng to ACP, more than 51,000 MW of offshore wrnd rs currently under development 
1n the Unrted States, 84 percent of whrch rs on the East Coast Thrs rncludes 938 MW 
currently under constructron, 18 projects 1n advanced development representrng 16,564 MW, 
and 18 projects 1n early development totalrng 33,875 MW Whrle only a few floatrng offshore 
wrnd projects are currently operatrng globally, the development prpellne more than doubled 
over the past year from 91,000 MW from 120 projects to 185,000 MW from 230 projects 
Developrng ﬂoatmg offshore wrnd projects 1n the Gulf of Marne wrll be rmportant to meet 
state and regronal targets and burld on the Unrversrty of Mame’s leadershrp 1n developrng the 
technology Wlnle ﬂoatrng offshore wrnd 1s more challengrng to develop than ﬁxed-bottom 
projects, the Gulf of Marne has the hrghest, most consrstent wrnd speeds on the East Coast 
Accordrng to the Natronal Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), ﬂoatrng offshore wrnd 
represents 63 percent of the total technrcal potentral for offshore wrnd 1n the North Atlantrc 
and 65 percent at the natronal level 6 A 2022 deep decarbonrzatron study for Massachusetts 
projected that ﬂoatrng offshore wrnd could account for more than 40 percent of total offshore 
wrnd deployment needed to meet New England’s clrmate and energy goals 1n 2035 and about 
70 percent rn 20507 
Mame can capztaltze on fallmg costs and federal lnC€IlZlV€S 
Lrke we have seen wrth land-based wrnd and solar photovoltarcs, the cost of offshore wrnd rs 
projected to fall raprdly over trme as the technology matures and the supply charn grows The 
cost of ﬁxed-bottom offshore wrnd projects has already fallen by 48 percent, from $162 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) 1n 2010 to $84/MWh1n 2021 due to development 1n other countrres8 
Whrle the costs of ﬂoatrng offshore wrnd projects are currently hrgher than ﬁxed-bottom 
projects, they are projected to be srmrlar by 2035 NRBL and DNV expect ﬂoatrng offshore 
wrnd costs to drp to $60 to $80/MWh by 2030 and $45 to $50/MWh by 2035 (see Exhrbrt 
B) 9 The Brden admrmstratron, whrch set a goal of 15,000 MW of ﬂoatrng offshore wrnd by 
2035, also has set a prrce target for ﬂoatrng offshore wrrrd power at $45/MWh by 203 5, 
whrch rs less than the costs of electrrcrty from new natural gas plants 1°

Clean energy 1ncent1ves 1n the h1stor1c federal Inﬂat1on Reduct10n Act passed last fall w1ll 
help lower the costs even further In fact, the t1m1ng of Ma1ne’s offshore w1nd procurement 
targets 1n LD 1895 1s desrgned to take advantage of federal tax credrts, wh1ch could lower the 
caprtal costs of pI‘O_]6ClS bu1lt 1n the Gulf of Mame by at least 30 percent Federal fund1ng 1s 
also ava1lable 1n tl11s tune frame to help bu1ld out Ma1ne’s supply cha1n and offshore w1nd 
component manufactur1ng, spur rnvestments 1n port lnfrastructure, and encourage 
transmissron plann1ng 
Wh1le the cost of offshore w1nd pro] ects has 1ncreased 1n the past two years due to 1nﬂat1on, 
r1s1ng commod1ty pnces, and supply cha1n pressures, UCS expects these effects to be 
temporary Land-based w1nd s1m1larly experrenced temporary cost 1ncreases durlng the 2008 
economlc recesslon But s1nce 2009, the cost of land-based wlnd has fallen by over two-th1rds 
as 1nﬂa11onary pressures eased, the technology advanced, and the US-based supply cha1n 
matured 11 
Offshore wmd can help stabzllze energy costs 
In add1t1on to becomrng 1ncreas1ngly cost-compet1t1ve over t1me, offshore w1nd also can help 
stab1l1ze energy costs for households and busrnesses by reduclng reg1onal relrance on 
1mported gas and o11 Dependence on gas for about half of the power generat1on 1n New 
England resulted 1n an 83 -percent supply-rate 1ncrease 1n Mame last year, and a 49-percent 
supply-rate 1ncrease th1s year, representrng a $32 _]l]I‘I1p 1n a typlcal household ’s monthly 
electr1c1ty b1ll 12 
Offshore w1nd power has no fuel costs, so power costs are more stable and 
pred1ctable over trme than fossrl fuel-ﬁred power W1nd also can help protect ratepayers from 
pnce volat1l1ty caused by such events as the Russ1an war 1n Ukralne or extreme weather (See 
Exh1b1t C) Moreover, offshore wlnd also would produce more electnc1ty dur1ng the wmter 
heat1ng months when New England energy demand 1s greatest 
Offshore w1nd development resultlng from LD 1895 also could put downward pressure on 
electr1c1ty and gas pr1ces—and save ratepayers money Electr1c1ty generat1on 1s drspatched at 
the regronal level accord1ng to 1ncreas1ng costs Srnce w1nd and solar have no fuel costs and 
low operat1ng costs, ut1l1t1es typ1cally d1spatch them ﬁrst Gas generators, on the other hand, 
have relatlvely h1gh fuel and operat1ng costs, so ut1l1t1es typ1cally drspatch them last to meet 
demand, thereby settmg the market pnce of electr1c1ty Thus, by reducrng the need for more 
expenslve gas generators that are on the margln, offshore w1nd could lower wholesale 
electrlcrty pnces 
0 For example, a 2020 NREL study found that deploymg 2,000 MW of offshore w1nd 
1n ISO-New England would reduce reglonal wholesale electr1c1ty pr1ces by l percent 
and result 1n total electr1c1ty productlon cost savrngs of over 5 percent when rmport

When offshore w1nd deployment was rncreased to 7,000 
MW, wholesale electrrclty prrce reductrons grew to 13 percent and productron cost 
savmgs mcreased to 18 percent 
0 An analys1s by ISO-NE found that 1f 1,600 MW of offshore w1nd had been onhne 
durrng the 2018 cold snap, consumers 1n New England would have saved more than 
$80 m1ll1on, carbon droxrde emrssrons would have been 11 percent lower, and more

Ensuring responsrble and equitable development of offshore wmd 
As someone who l1ves 1n a small coastal ﬁshmg commun1ty near Ma1ne’s Acadla Nat1onal 
Park, I can see up close the lmportance of developmg offshore wmd 1n a responsrble and 
equltable way that rncludes strong labor and envrromnental standards and proteotlons for the 
ﬁshmg mdustry, local commumtres, and trlbes The project labor agreements (PLA) and labor 
“peace” agreements 1n LD 1895 are supported by the BlueGreen All1ance(ofwh1ch UCS rsa 
foundlng member) and have been adopted by other states to ensure offshore wmd projects are 
bullt w1th strong labor standards and are able to maxrmrze federal mcentrves avarlable 
through the Inﬂatron Reductron Act and rnfrastructure laws 
LD 1895 wrsely rncludes tax 1ncent1ves that would encourage wmd development outslde of 
Lobster Management Area l and offset the modest addltlonal costs of locatmg projects 
further offshore In addrtron, the b1ll would provrde fundmg for local ﬁsh1ng communrtres, 
whrch would create new jobs and tax revenue, and for rndependent screntrﬁc research to 
determlne the best way for Marne to embrace the vast beneﬁts of w1nd power whrle 
protectlng w1ldl1fe, ﬁshenes and the envlronment 
The number of turblnes and area needed 1n the Gulf of Marne to meet Ma1ne’s targets 1n LD 
1895 1s relatrvely small W1th the 15 MW wmd turbrnes that are becomrng the rndustry 
standard, meetrng the targets 1n the b1ll would only requrre 67 turbrnes for 1,000 MW of 
projects under contract by 2030 and 187 turbrnes for 2,800 MW under contract by 2035 Data 
from NREL and BOEM leases 1n other parts of the country suggest the area needed to meet 
the 2,800 MW target 1s approxrmately 226,800 acres or 2 3 percent of the parts 1n the Gulf of 
Marne under conslderatron by BOEM, the federal agency that oversees energy act1v1t1es1n 
the Outer Contrnental Shelf around the country Wh1le more area would be needed to meet 
reglonal targets, clearly there 1s more than enough space to srte projects 1n a way that avords 
or m1n1m1zes rmpacts on envrronmentally sensltrve and hrgh-densrty ﬁshmg areas 
LD 1895 also guarantees a place at the table for federal recognrzed and state acknowledged 
trrbes and would requlre developers to consult wrth trrbes every step of the way Further, the 
brll rncludes workforce development, employment, and contractrng opportunrtres, as well as 
ﬁnanclal and technlcal asslstance to support robust monrtormg of the ﬁsherres that local trlbes 
care about most
