Mark W Lawrence THE MAINE SENATE 3 Siam House Statlon 
Senator, District 35 131st Legislature Augusta, Mame 04333 
Representative Zeigler, colleagues on the Committee, my name is Senator Mark Lawrence, and 
l’m here today to introduce LD 1895, An Act Regarding the Procurement of Energy from 
Offshore Wind Resources 
Offshore wind provides us with rare opportunity to both meet Maine’s climate and clean energy 
goals, and to take advantage of one of the largest economic development opportunities Maine 
will see this century LD 1895 builds on the work of Maine's Offshore Wind Roadmap process, 
establishing an offshore wind procurement schedule that will jumpstart the development ofa 
commercial offshore wind industry in Maine, realizing both of these opportunities 
A broad coalition has come together behind this bill, which will strengthen Maine's economy, by 
stabilizing energy costs, and creating thousands of new family-supporting clean energy _|ObS 
This coalition includes environmental and conservation groups, organized labor, and notably, 
members of the fishing industry, and many of these groups are represented here today and will 
speak about specific provisions in the bill 
The bill lays out a procurement schedule starting in 2025, with requirements to contract for 
1,000 megawatts of offshore wind power by 2030, and a total of 2,800 megawatts by 2035 The 
bill includes important safeguards for ratepayers and flexibility for the commission, provisions 
encouraging regional collaboration, and an authorization to procure shared transmission 
infrastructure 
Because floating offshore wind development will occur in federal waters, this bill takes the 
important opportunity to set high standards Maine can be proud of This includes requirements 
that ensure dedicated funding streams for research and monitoring for wildlife and 
environmental impacts, strong labor standards, investing in fishing communities, and ensuring 
that the benefits of offshore wind are widely shared, and that no community is left behind 
The bill includes an important incentive for projects sited outside of Lobster Management Area 
1, that is, the areas where most of Maine’s fishing effort occurs This is a breakthrough, and an 
opportunity to significantly reduce conflicts and impacts in Maine’s fisheries and fishing 
communities while we develop the clean energy we need to address climate change 
This is the right time for this bill The federal leasing process is already underway, and other 
states are looking to the Gulf of Maine for their renewable energy needs Maine must act now to 
ensure that our voice is heard, and Maine people benefit from the development of this industry 
LD 1895 will create a Maine-made offshore wind industry, using Maine's technology and talent 
It will help us meet our climate and clean energy goals, and it will help stabilize the high energy 
prices that have been hurting Maine families and businesses all across the state It will protect 
Maine's fishing communities, and sets strong standards to ensure this brand-new industry 
benefits people in every corner of the state 
Thank you for your consideration, and l'm happy to answer any questions you may have
