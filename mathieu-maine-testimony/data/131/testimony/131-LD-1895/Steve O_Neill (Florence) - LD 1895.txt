Thank
you
Senator
Lawrence
and
Representative
Zeigler,
and
members
of
the
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities
and
Technology
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD1895.
My
name
is
Steve
O’Neill
and
I
am
the
Northeast
Regional
Organizer
for
the
BlueGreen
Alliance.
The
BlueGreen
Alliance
is
a
coalition
of
labor
unions
and
environmental
organizations,
coming
together
to
solve
today’s
environmental
challenges
in
ways
that
create
and
maintain
quality
jobs
and
build
a
clean,
thriving,
and
equitable
economy.
It
is
vital
that
LD1895
not
only
pass,
but
pass
this
session.
As
has
been
widely
reported,
the
Gulf
of
Maine
is
warming
faster
than
97%
of
the
world’s
ocean
surface,
imperiling
critical
wildlife
ecosystems
and
fisheries.

It
takes
time
for
such
large
scale
projects
to
get
off
the
ground,
and
in
order
for
Maine’s
offshore
wind
industry
to
advance,
developers
need
clarity
and
certainty
regarding
procurement
and
regulation
as
soon
as
possible.
LD1895
provides
a
clear
framework
that
is
aligned
with
what
other
states
and
the
federal
government
are
doing,
setting
up
Maine’s
offshore
wind
Industry
to
be
robust,
equitable,
and
responsible.
It
protects
fisheries
and
wildlife
habitats,
provides
relief
to
low-income
ratepayers,
and
maximizes
economic
benefits
for
Maine.
Two
key
provisions
in
the
legislation
are
essential
for
ensuring
Maine
residents
receive
the
maximum
economic
benefits
for
offshore
wind
projects:
Project
Labor
Agreements
(PLAs)
for
construction
and
Labor
Peace
Agreements
(LPAs),
including
union
neutrality,
for
manufacturing,
maritime,
operations,
and
maintenance.
Project
Labor
and
Labor
Peace
Agreements
are
widely
recognized
as
essential
tools
for
streamlining
labor
relations
and
workflow,
especially
in
large
scale
operations.
The
federal
government
currently
requires
PLAs
for
any
federal
construction
projects
costing
$35
million
or
more.

Similarly,
the
first
large-scale
offshore
wind
project
in
the
United
States,
Vineyard
Wind,
is
currently
being
developed
under
a
Project
Labor
Agreement.

For
the
sake
of
brevity,
this
testimony
will
focus
on
only
two
of
the
ways
that
Project
Labor
and
Labor
Peace
Agreements
serve
the
public
interest:
safety
and
economic
outcomes.
S A F E T Y
Project
labor
agreements
lead
to
safer
working
conditions
due
to
a
more
highly
skilled
workforce
and
greater
safety
protections.
A
2021
Canadian
study
showed
tha
t
unionization
in
commercial
and
industrial
construction,
maintenance,
and
repair
work
was
associated
with
a
25%
lower
lost-time
injury
rate;
23%
lower
incidence
of
musculoskeletal
lost-time
injury
claims;
and
16%
lower
incidence
of
critical
lost
time
injury
claims.
5
Similarly,
a
2011
University
of
Michigan
study
shows
that
accidents,
including
death,
are
more
common
in
states
with
a
preponderance
of
non-union
contractors.
6
Labor
Peace
Agreements
in
manufacturing,
maritime,
and
maintenance
industries
often
include
union
neutrality
provisions.
These
provisions
support
workers’
rights
to
join
unions
freely
and
collectively
bargain,
promoting
safer
workplaces.
Union
workers
are
more
likely
to
negotiate
health
and
safety
measures
and
receive
paid
sick
leave,
all
of
which
are
essential
to
ensure
worker
safety
while
manufacturing,
operating,
and
maintaining
components
that
can
weigh
600
tons.
LPAs
and
PLAs
promote
safety
measures
in
working
conditions
through
a
number
of
mechanisms.
They
establish
joint
labor-management
safety
committees
that
collaborate
on
identifying
and
addressing
workplace
hazards.
Mandatory
safety
training
programs
ensure
employees
are
equipped
to
handle
risks
and
emergencies.
These
agreements
also
establish
procedures
for
reporting
and
investigating
hazards,
provide
necessary
safety
equipment
and
resources,
and
encourage
regular
safety
audits.

Union
workers,
on
average,
earn
significantly
higher
wages
compared
to
non-union
workers.
This
wage
advantage
has
positive
ripple
effects
on
the
neighborhoods
and
towns
where
they
reside,
leading
to
thriving
local
communities.Every
dollar
a
worker
spends
in
the
local
economy
is
multiplied,
as
people
shop
locally,
renovate
their
houses,
fix
their
cars
and
get
their
hair
cut
locally.
PLAs
and
registered
apprenticeships
provide
opportunities
to
historically
marginalized
populations,
including
communities
of
color,
women,
and
veterans,
ensuring
that
the
new
economy
we
build
is
a
more
equitable
one.
Indeed,
while
union
participation
raises
standards
for
all
workers,
it
is
especially
beneficial
in
removing
disparities
based
on
race
and
gender:
•
White
male
union
members
earn
17%
more
in
wages
on
average
compared
to
white
male
non-union
workers;
•
Female
union
members
earn
28%
more
in
wages
on
average
compared
to
non-union
female
workers;
•
Black
union
members
earn
28%
more
in
wages
on
average
compared
to
non-union
Black
workers;
and
•
Latine
union
members
earn
40%
more
in
wages
on
average
compared
to
non-union
Latine
workers.
7
At
the
same
time,
PLAs
not
only
bring
the
overall
cost
of
projects
down,
8
but
also
play
a
crucial
role
in
preventing
labor
disruptions.
By
establishing
a
framework
for
labor
stability,
PLAs
promote
a
consistent
and
uninterrupted
workflow,
minimizing
the
risk
of
strikes
or
other
labor-related
conflicts.
Additionally,
PLAs
contribute
to
a
more
skilled
and
experienced
workforce,
resulting
in
improved
project
efficiency,
reduced
turnover,
and
fewer
accidents,
all
of
which
contribute
to
lower
costs
for
ratepayers,
and
greater
return
on
public
dollars.
We
need
these
kinds
of
agreements
to
ensure
projects
come
to
fruition.
In
short,
LD1895
will
ensure
that
the
offshore
wind
industry
develops
in
Maine
in
a
high-road,
equitable,
and
environmentally
responsible
manner,
and
we
urge
your
support.
