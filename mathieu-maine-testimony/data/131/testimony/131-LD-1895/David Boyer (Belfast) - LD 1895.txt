LD 1895
I am testifying in support of LD1895. I live in a coastal town, Belfast, and I can easily
see over to Mack Point, the (hopefully) probable port location for this first offshore 
wind project in Maine's coastal waters. I regard this legislation as an essential 
component in facilitating Maine's and New England's transition to a fossil fuel free 
energy system. It is important to see that this project is a key part of our nation's 
response to the climate crisis.
I am particularly impressed with these features of this bill: 
1. LD 1895 sets clear goals to develop floating offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine, all
while prioritizing and protecting our wildlife, fisheries, and communities. 
2. The bill includes strong labor standards to build high-quality careers for Mainers 
and ensure no community is left behind. It shows that Maine is serious about offshore 
wind, spurring investment in our workforce, ports, businesses, and communities.  I 
regard the DEI objectives as an especially significant strength of the bill.
3. Through dedicated funding for conserving habitat and independent research, and 
siting incentives to avoid conflict with fisheries, this bill carries through on its 
commitment to environmental justice.
I strongly urge passage of this bill. Thank you.
