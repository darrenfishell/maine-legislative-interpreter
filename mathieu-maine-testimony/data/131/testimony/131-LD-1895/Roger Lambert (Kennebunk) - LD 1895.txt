LD 1895
I am writing as a constituent to express my strong support for LD 1985, which builds 
upon top recommendations from Maine's Offshore Wind Roadmap.  This legislation 
to procure energy from offshore wind resources will strengthen Maine's economy by 
creating thousands of new high-quality jobs and stabilizing energy costs by reducing 
our reliance on imported gas and oil. It also sets high standards for wildlife, fisheries, 
and environmental monitoring, while also requiring important labor protections and 
providing benefits for Maine's most vulnerable communities.  The Gulf of Maine has 
some of the strongest and most consistent wind in the world, and we have an 
opportunity to develop this renewable energy resource in a responsible and equitable 
way.
