Tesnmony 1n Support of LD 1895, An Act Regardlng the Procurement of Energy from 
Offshore Wlnd Resources 
To the Commlttee on Energy, Utilltles and Technology 
by Jack Shapiro, Chmate and Clean Energy Program Dlrector 
May 18, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representatlve Ze1g1er, and members of the Energy, Ut1l1t1es and Teclmology 
Cormnlttee, my name 1s Jack Shaplro, and I am the Chmate and Clean Energy Dlrector at the 
Natural Resources COll1'1C1l of Mame (NRCM) Today, on behalf of our 25,000 members and 
supporters, NRCM testlﬁes 1n strong support of LD 1895, An Act Regardlng the Procurement of 
Energy from Offshore W1nd Resources1 
Offshore wind 1s essennal to meet Ma1ne’s Climate and Clean Energy Goals 
NRCM has been worklng for more than 60 years to protect, restore, and conserve Ma1ne’s 
envlromnent, and today, that means one of our central pr1or1t1es 1s addresslng the threat of 
cl1mate change The 1mpacts of chmate change are already here The Gulf of Mame 1s warmlng 
faster than 99% of the world’s oceans 2 Chmate change 1s threatenlng coastal commun1t1es,3 
contnbutlng to record ralnfalls and ﬂood1ng,4 and affectlng 1con1c lndustnes 1n Mame l1ke 
logg1ng,5 clamm1ng,6 and wlnter sports7 
Mame has acted declslvely 1n the past few years to address cllmate change and to protect Mame 
people from 1ts 1mpacts In 2019, blpartlsan ma]or1t1es of the Mame Leglslature passed new 
cllmate laws to sh1ﬁ 80% of Ma1ne’s electnclty supply to renewables by 2030 and 100% by 
2050,8 and reduce greenhouse gas em1ss1ons by 45% 1n 2030, and 80% 1n 2050 9 S1nce then

Ma1ne has also establ1shed a net-zero em1ss1ons target by 2045,10 and Governor M1lls has 
announced a goal of reachmg 100% renewable energy by 2040 11 
In December 2020, after months of work and 1nput from hundreds of people ﬁom both part1es 
and from every corner of the state — the Cl1mate Councll released Mame Won ’t Wan‘ , Ma1ne’s 
comprehenslve cl1mate actlon plan 12 The Cl1mate Act1on Plan 1s comprehenslve, but the central 
strategy embod1ed 1n the plan 1s electnﬁcatlon, that 1s, sw1tch1ng the end uses of energy — how 
we fuel our cars and trucks, and how we heat our homes — away from foss1l fuels, toward 
electnclty Cruclally, that electnc1ty needs to come from affordable renewable energy sources 
Th1s approach 1s re1nforced through the 2022 Inﬂatron Reductlon Act, w1th 1ts hundreds of 
b1ll1ons of lnvestments and lncentlves for renewable energy, electnc vehlcles, and home 
electr1ﬁcat1on_ 13 Th1s w1ll requlre a substantlal amount of new electnc1ty Depend1ng on the 
partlcular m1x of technolog1es that are deployed, 1nclud1ng efﬁc1ency, load management, and 
others, estlmates are that we may need double the amount of electnclty as we use t0day14 — all 
of wh1ch w1ll need to be renewable 
Offshore w1nd (OSW) power from the Gulf of Mame w1ll play an essent1al role 1n prov1d1ng the 
renewable energy Ma1ne needs to meet 1ts cllmate and clean energy obl1gat1ons The Gulf of 
Marne has some of the strongest and most cons1stent w1nds 1n the world That means locat1ng 
offshore Wll1(lpI'0_]6C'[S 1n the Gulf of Ma1ne w1ll come W1th h1gh-capaclty factors, or put another 
way, we w1ll get more bang for our buck for every turblne 1n the water 
Offshore wind w1ll stablllze energy prlces 
Our dependence on natural gas for about half of the power generat1on 1n New England has dr1ven 
eye-watenng electncrty prrce sp1kes Gas pnce volat1l1ty resulted 1n an 83% supply rate 1ncrease 
last year,15 and a 49% supply rate 1ncrease th1s year 16 Offshore w1nd power has no fuel costs 
once 1t 1s bu1lt, bnngmg stable pnces that are locked 1n for years through long-term contracts 
Th1s w1ll help 1nsulate Ma1ne people and bus1nesses from the harmful pnce volat1l1ty that goes 
hand-1n-hand W1th our dependence on foss1l fuels A 2023 RENEW-NE study conﬁrmed th1s, 
ﬁnd1ng that "Long-term renewable contracts, wh1ch lock 1n steady pnces for decades at a tlme, 
prov1de beneﬁts that offer less pnce volat1l1ty and lower electr1c1ty market pnces" as well as 
prov1de a hedge agalnst volatlle natural gas pnces 17

Large~sca1e w1nd development w111 also have beneﬁcral rmpacts on wholesale power market 
pnces A 2022 NC State study that found that "[O]ffshore wmd power could help lower 
wholesale e1ectr1c1ty pnces on average for s1x states 1n New England" by reduclng the seventy of 
pnce splkes dunng modeled cold snaps when demand 1s h1gh 18 
In December 2022, Daymark 
Advrsors and Amencan Clean Power (ACP) released a study on the proposed Northern Mame 
w1nd pro] ect Whrle th1s study consrdered onshore wmd, they found that roughly lGW of wmd 
would lower energy market pnces and provrde s1gn1ﬁcant cost savlngs for consumers 1n New 
England states 19 The lmpacts of an offshore w1nd pro] ect would probably be s1m1lar or posslbly 
greater, smce offshore w1nd would be generatmg more power more of the trme per turbrne due to 
the better w1nd resource offshore 
Offshore w1nd w1ll l1kely bnng other energy system beneﬁts as well As Mame, and New 
England as a whole, trans1t1ons toward a grrd powered by renewable energy, havrng a dlverse 
supply of renewable energy W111 help reduce system costs Offshore w1nd 1s a great complement 
to very cheap solar for example, because 1t peaks at mght and m the wmter, whereas solar peaks 
durmg the day and 1n the summer The more those complement each other, the less expenslve 
lnfrastructure and storage needs we have on top of those baselmes to meet the peak moments 
when we have the most demand, wh1ch ultrmately drrve the costs of the gnd 
Offshore wmd IS a generational economrc opportumty for Mame 
Offshore w1nd presents Mame w1th a rare opportunrty Not only 1s offshore w1nd essentlal to 
meetmg Ma1ne’s clrmate and clean energy goals and to addressmg the hrgh costs of energy long- 
term, but accordmg to the Mame Chamber of Commerce, 1t also represents one of the largest 
economrc development opportmntres Ma1ne may see th1s century 2° Ma1ne’s 10-year ECOIIOIIIIC 
Development Strategy names offshore w1nd as a key opportunlty for 1m1ovat1on, revenue, and 
economlc development 21 
The potent1a1 for mvestment, _]Ob creat1on, and busrness development 1s srgnlﬁcant A report 
prepared as part of Ma1ne’s offshore wmd roadmap process found that developmg the ﬁrst 1,600 
megawatts (MW) of offshore w1nd 1n Mame would generate between $114 and $362 m1ll1on 1n 
economlc act1v1ty from constructlon, and $36 - $133 m1ll1on 1n economrc act1v1ty every year 
from ongomg operatrons and marntenance Accordlng to the same report, Mame could

surveylng, boat bu11d1ng and ma1ntenance, and research and development ”23 
LD 1895 builds on years of ﬂoatmg offshore w1nd work 1n Mame 
The majonty of offshore w1nd around the World uses “ﬁxed-bottom ” technology That 1s, the 
towers and turb1nes are mounted on foundat1ons that are secured dlrectly to the seaﬂoor Due to 
the depth of the Gulf of Ma1ne, offshore Wmd development here W111 need to be “ﬂoat1ng” 
offshore w1nd, mounted on ﬂoat1ng platforms anchored to the ocean ﬂoor w1th moonng cables 
Ma1ne has been work1ng on ﬂoat1ng offshore w1nd for years In 2013, the ﬁrst gnd-connected 
offshore w1nd turb1ne was 1nstalled on a ﬂoatmg platform off Castme The turb1ne was a 18 
scale model of a ﬂoatmg platform desrgn developed at the Un1vers1ty of Ma1ne 24 A full-scale 
slngle turbme demonstrat1on pro] ect, also us1ng the Un1vers1ty of Ma1ne’s technology, 1s nearly 
at the constructlon phase, planned for a s1te south of Monhegan 25 The Govemor’s Energy Ofﬁce 
has applled to lease a 15 2-square-m1le s1te 1n the Gulf of Ma1ne for a 12-turb1ne research array, 
and th1s pI‘0_]6Ct 1s currently 1n the 1n1t1al stages of the federal pemnttlng process 26 Work 1s also 
underway to evaluate potent1al s1tes for an Offshore W1nd Port, cruc1a1 to garnenng the 
economlc beneﬁts that W111 come W1th offshore w1nd development 1n the Gulf of Mame 27 
Most relevant to LD 1895, the Governor ’s Energy Ofﬁce recently concluded the Mame Offshore 
W1nd Roadmap process The Roadmap 1s “a stakeholder-dnven comprehens1ve plan that offers 
detalled strategles for Ma1ne to real1ze econom1c, energy, and cl1mate beneﬁts from offshore 
w1nd, 1n con]unct1on w1th con1mun1t1es, ﬁshenes, and w1ldl1fe of the Gulf of Ma1ne ”28 The 
Roadmap lncluded nearly 100 worklng group members, more than 50 meetlngs, and mult1ple 
techmcal analyses Notably, a top recomrnendanon from the Roadmap 1s to "Establ1sh a 
respons1ble OSW procurement target and phased so11c1tat1on address1ng a meanlngful percentage 
of Ma1ne’s electr1c1ty needs "29

Offshore wind in the Gulf of Mame 1s movlng forward and Mame must act 
The federal government has set ambrtrous offshore wmd goals In 2021, Pres1dentB1den 
announced a goal of deploymg 30 GW of offshore wrnd by 2030,30 and 1n 2022, expanded that 
goal to mclude deploymg an addrtlonal l5GW of ﬂoatmg offshore Wrnd by 2035 31 
The federal 
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), part of the U S Department of Intenor, has 
pubhshed a schedule for developmg and offermg leases for offshore w1nd development to 
support these goals, mcludrng a lease sale 1n the Gulf of Mame 1n late 2024 32 The Gulf of Marne 
leasrng process 1s well Lmderway In August 2022, BOEM released a request for mformatron 
(RFI) for the Gulf of Marne The RFI1s "the ﬁrst step 1n BOEM’s commercral plarmmg and 
leasrng process to rdentrfy the offshore locatrons that appear most surtable for development, 
taklng rnto consrderatron potentral rmpacts to resources and ocean users ” After rece1v1ng 
comments from the publ1c and developers, they released a draft call area m January 2023, anda 
ﬁnal call area 1n Apnl 2023 33 
Act1v1t1es 1n other states show that engagmg m the Gulf of Marne and on ﬂoatmg offshore w1nd 
w1ll not wart for Mame Massachusetts 1s mterested 1n ﬂoatmg offshore w1nd development as 
well, and at a recent BOEM Gulf of Marne task force meetmg hosted 1n Bangor, Massachusetts 
ofﬁcrals stated that they would ultrmately need 23 GW of offshore w1nd power overall to meet 
that state’s offshore w1nd goals Some of that demand w1ll undoubtedly be met w1th power from 
pro] ects 1n the the Gulf of Mame BOEM offered the ﬁrst federal ﬂoatmg offshore wmd lease 
sale for s1tes off the Callfornla coast 1n December 2022 That lease sale resulted 1n 5 leases 
totalmg 373,268 acres, Wh1ch1s estrmated to support 4 6 GW of wmd power 34 
The Brden Adm1n1strat1on ’s amb1t1ous offshore Wmd goals, new mcentrves from federal clrmate 
legrslatron, and strong demand for renewable energy from other New England states all mean 
that offshore w1nd development W111 happen 1n the Gulf of Marne Marne must act now to be able

LD 1895 sets strong standards to ensure offshore wlnd development leaves no one behlnd 
As offshore w1nd has begtm to develop 1n the Umted States, 1t has become common practlce for 
states enact1ng offshore wlnd pol1c1es and procurements to use the1r authonty to set standards for 
offshore w1nd development, whether that 1s to protect the env1ronment or the1r state’s ﬁshenes, 
set hlgh labor standards, ensure that the beneﬁts of th1s new lndustry are d1stnbuted equ1tably, 
and that essentlal lssues l1ketransm1ss1on plann1ng and reg1onalcollaborat1on are addressed 37 
LD 1895 requtres developers to subm1t plans outhmng how they W111 address many of these 
1ssues as we develop th1s brand-new 1ndustry for Ma1ne These plans 1nclude w1ldl1fe, ﬁsherles, 
and envlromnental m1t1gat1on plans, d1vers1ty, equ1ty, and 1nclus1on plans, consultat1on, 
stakeholder engagement, and commumty beneﬁts plans, workforce development and _]l.1St 
trans1t1on plans, and ﬁshenes con1mun1t1es 1nvestment plans These prov1s1ons, along w1th 
ded1cated fund1ng streams for research and monltonng around potent1al 1mpacts 1n the Gulf of 
Mame, are essenttal to makmg sure that offshore w1nd 1s developed respons1ble, and the beneﬁts 
from th1s lndustry leave no one beh1nd 
Shared transm1ss1on lnfrastructure can reduce costs and 1mpacts 
Bnngmg the power generated by offshore w1nd pro] ects to the onshore grld 1s a complex

mfrastructure to support offshore w1nd development Planned and shared re g1onal offshore gr1d 
lnfrastructure can s1gn1ﬁcantly lower costs and 1mpacts assoc1ated w1th transm1ss1on 
development A 2023 Brattle Group study found that proact1ve offshore transm1ss1on planmng 
could save U S consumers $20 b1ll1on and result 1n 60-70% fewer shore cross1ngs and necessary 
onshore transm1ss1on upgrades 38 Thls authonzatlon also supports Work that the s1x New 
England states are do1ng to collaborate on a reg1onal approach to transnnss1on1nfrastn1cture 39

Gulf of Mame, strengthenmg Ma1ne’s economy by stab1l1z1ng energy costs and creatmg 
thousands of new farrnly-supportlng clean energy _]0bS The Comm1ttee has a chance to bu1lda 
new home-grown clean energy source Ma1ne can be proud of, one that addresses cllmate change,

A 2022 study analyzed project costs related to sltlng |n the North Atlantlc, and found that wmd‘ resource was the 
pnmary rnfluence on pFOjECt cost (I e , the better wmd resource, the lower the ﬁnal cost of energy), but d|stance 
from shore was a cost dnver as well, lmked mostly to transmlsslon costs1
