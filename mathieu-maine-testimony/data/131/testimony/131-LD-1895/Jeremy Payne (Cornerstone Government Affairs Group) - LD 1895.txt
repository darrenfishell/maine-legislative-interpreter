Re: Testimony neither for nor against LD 1895, “An Act Regarding the Procurement of 
Energy from Offshore Wind Resources ” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Teclniology 
Committee 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Cornerstone Government Affairs Group 
here to testify neither for nor agamst LD 1895 on behalf of our client the Mame Renewable 
Energy Association (“MREA”) 
First, we want to applaud Senator Lawrence for his leadership on developmg a procurement 
process to unleash the enormous potential off offshore wind I had the honor of serving on the 
Offshore Wind Road Map’s advisory committee — as well as serving as Celina Curn1ingham ’s 
co-chair of the energy markets and strategies working group — and this diverse group of people 
worked extremely well together over the last 18 months or so We tackled really complex topics, 
for example developing a capable and diverse workforce, avoiding and mitigating impacts to the 
ﬁsheries industries and aquatic species, examinnig transmission options, how to entice other 
states to collaborate on developmg p1’O_]CClIS m the Gulf of Maine, and designing a cost-effective 
procurement process which will attract high quality, competitive bids None of these issues have 
simple and unanimous answers, and we believe LD 1895 takes some important first steps toward 
growing our Maine-based offshore wind industry However, we are disappomted that the very 
people and entities this bill contemplates submitting bids were largely shut out from any direct 
involvement of the drafting of the procurement pieces of this bill We appreciate this 
opportunity to offer some thoughts — and are of course willing to work with the sponsor, the 
committee, and other stakeholders to continue designing the procurements 
We are glad to support the procurement schedule and amounts contemplated m the bill — we 
believe this sends a critical signal to the marketplace to expend ﬁnancial resources on pre- 
development work, community outreach, discussions with contractors in order to ready their bids 
for the 1/1/25 bid process Importantly, it also envisions subsequent procurements occurring on 
a reasonable and predictable schedule — this will help bidders who do not receive a contract to 
continue development and refining their bids for future RFPs

We are concerned, however, wrth a few 1mportant components of the procurement b1d revlew 
process 
I The PUC 1s mstructed to p1‘OV1d6 a 60% Welghtlng as 1t relates to pr1c1ng 
Notably, th1s 1s less than what the PUC has recently used regardmg the so-called 
gnd-scale procurement from LD 14941 , wlnch requ1res the PUC to provlde a 70% 
werghtrng to prrce and 30% werghtmg to eoonomlc development co /ns1derat1ons, 
I Next, the leg1slat1on requ1res to provlde 25% werghtmg to b1ds wrth econom1c 
development and commumty beneﬁts, however, 1t mcludes prov1s1ons such as 
Pro] ect Labor Agreements and Labor Peace Agreements, and 
I And last, LD 1895 rnstructs the PUC to apply 15% werghtmg to b1ds w1th natural 
resources beneﬁts, 1nclud1ng add1t1onalpr1vate ftmdlng for momtormg 
envrromnental lmpacts We bel1eve the regulatory penmttmg process Wlll already 
requ1re any applrcants to conduct appropnate studles and ongomg momtonng 
We understand the legrslatlon chooses to pr1or1t1ze other socral 1ssues, but 1t 1s lmportant to1 
remember those decrsrons have a l1teral cost to consumers Tlns 1eg1slat1on, or any other, can 
declde to 1nclude other non-energy pollcles w1th1n b1ds but we should be mlndful those costs W111 
not Just vamsh, but w1ll ultnnately show up m the b1d pr1ces the PUC revlews 
It 1s rmportant to acknowledge that Ma1ne’s constructlon workforce 1s approxrmately 90% non- 
umon, so prov1d1ng preference to orgamzed labor agreements may have the effect of excludlng 
Mame-based compames from bemg able to b1d for th1s rmportant work In order to ensure thls 
process does not create a _]Ol3S program for Massachusetts constructlon compames, one 
reasonable mlddle ground would be to allow employee-owned (“ESOPs”) compames to b1d for 
the work and be el1g1ble for th1s 25% we1ght1ng Th1s approach was used 1n last year’s LD 1969, 
“An Act Concermng Equ1ty 1n Renewable Energy Projects and Workforce Development ” 
Glven the amount of work ahead of us as we pursue a clean energy trans1t1on, we do not beheve 
that effect1vely dlscouragmg any development 1ns1de of the Lease Management Area 1 (LMA1) 
1s appropnate If all p1'O_]€CtS proposed for LMA1 are automatlcally precluded from recelvlng 
any tax rncentrves then we are ultlmately pushlng p1'O_]6C'[S further and further from shore, whtch 
w1ll certamly lncrease transmrsslon costs and overall programmat1c costs to consumers

We fully agree that the PUC and brdders should coordmate procurement efforts w1th other New 
England states, as has been done wlth the so-called Northem Mame Renewable Energy 
Development Program3 
Frnally, we want to emphaslze that we know th1s 1s a very complex 1ssue and We apprecrate all 
those mvolved w1thth1s b1ll’s creatlon — and we are glad to part1c1pate 1n makmg lmprovements

Thank you
