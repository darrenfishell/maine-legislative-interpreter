Testimony in support of LD 1895
Esteemed members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee,
My name is Caitlin Marshall.   I am a resident of Portland, Maine and member of the 
Portland Climate Action Team (PCAT).  I am testifying in support of LD 1895, and 
ask you to please vote “ought to pass” on this important bill.
To meet our state’s clearly articulated climate action goals, we need to wisely and 
rapidly adopt a variety of clean energy technologies.  Offshore wind is a hugely 
important one of those; research indicates about a third of Maine’s energy mix should 
come from off-shore wind. (1) 
Regarding concerns about impacting our already challenged fishing industry: we 
should absolutely include fishermen’s voices, and include protections, in development
of offshore wind plans, and I believe LD 1895 does this.  It’s also worth noting that 
climate change presents a REALLY big threat to the fishing industry.  Long term, it’s 
probably the biggest threat.  With smart design and good siting, we minimize damage 
to fishing, and help solve the climate crisis, which threatens to decimate fish 
populations entirely. 
Further, it’s worth noting that developing offshore wind establishes Maine as a leader 
in renewables.  This is now widely supported - the latest poll from Pew states fully 
72% of Americans favor ramping up renewables. (2)
We have the technical R & D leadership in the University of Maine, we have 
investors ready to scale up, and we have broad support for the clean energy transition.
Please support LD 1895.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Caitlin Marshall
