TESTINIONY BEFORE THE ENERGY, UTILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE 
Testlmony of Dr. Hablb Dagher, Executlve Dlrector, Unlverslty of Mame Advanced Structures and Composltes 
Center 
In Reference to LD 1895 “An Act Regarding the Procurement of Energy 
from Offshore Wlnd Resources ” 
Senator Lawrence, Representat1ve Ze1g1er, and Members of the J o1nt Standmg Comrmttee on Energy, Ut1l1t1es and 
Technology (EUT) My name 1s Hablb Dagher and I am the Executlve Dlrector of the Unlverslty of Mame’s 
Advanced Structures and Composltes Center It 1s the largest un1vers1ty-based research center 1n Mame, w1th 350 
full and part-tlme employees Over the 37 years at UMa1ne, I have been commltted to develop teclmologles that 
create Ma1ne Jobs, protect the envlronment, and educate leaders 
The Center through our research grants and contracts has ﬁnanclally sponsored 2,700 student lnterns, who got 
pa1d to work on research p1'0_]6ClIS Wl11Cl1 transformed thelr educatlon For the past 15 years, hundreds of students 
and partners have worked on offshore w1nd 1n our lab and some are now leaders 1n the lndustry A procurement 
b11l such as LD 1895 1s urgently needed to pass th1s sess1on to keep Mame relevant 1n a growlng US and global 
ﬂoatlng offshore w1nd lndustry, retaln and grow th1s home-grown talent of hlghly commltted bnght young 
englneers, and grow a whole new clean energy mdustry for Mame 
I am testlfylng 1n support of LD 1895, “An Act Regardlng the Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wlnd 
Resources ” , assummg that 1t w1l1 mcorporate fnendly amendments that strengthens Ma1ne technology leadershlp, 
1ncent1v1zes the use of Mame-developed hull teclmologles, the use of a Ma1ne-based eng1neer1ng workforce to 
deslgn the farms, and the use of local Ma1ne labor to fabncate the ﬂoatlng hulls here 1n Ma1ne
1. Why now? 
In 2010, the leglslature voted unammously for Mame to enter the offshore w1nd race, and Mame voters approved 
an $11 m1ll1on bond for UMa1ne to develop ﬂoatlng w1nd technology Over the 15 years, We developed ﬂoatlng 
turbme teclmologles that can be made 1n Mame, that has earned more than 70 patents and have attracted over 
$150 nnlhon 1n DOE and lndustry mvestments A procurement b1ll rgw 1s key to keep Mame 1n the race, to stay 
and to ﬁnrsh the J01) thatMa1ners have asked us to do 
Marne does not have tlme to bllnk The world and the rest of the east and west coast states are already runnmg, 
W1th procurement bllls of the1r own Th1s year, the US has declared ﬂoatrng w1nd turb1nes as a US EarthShot, as 
a key technology to meet our natlonal clrmate and clean energy goals, a technology the US wants to lead the world 
1n Our Mame team has been prepanng for th1s ﬂoatmg w1nd race for 15 years and we are capable of w1nr11ng, 
however, wrthout a procurement b111 now, we Wlll remarn on the s1de11nes watch1ng other states and countnes nm 
by R1ght1n our nelghborhood, MA, Connectlcut, RI, NY, NJ all already have GW-scale procurement targets In 
Callforma a few months ago, BOEM leased 5GW of ﬂoatmg w1nd farms, and lnvestors are l1n1ng up, port fac1l1t1es 
are be1ng planned 1n Humboldt Bay 
2. A Procurement bill needs to pass th1s sesslon, but the current verslon needs frlendly amendments. 
We would l1ke to suggest fnendly amendments to the b1ll to 1ncent1v1ze the use of ﬂoat1ng technology that can be 
desrgned and produced 1n Marne 
The plan start1ng 15 years ago has been to grow the state technology and eng1neer1ng leadershlp and _]0l)S We 
wanted to desrgn and produce the hulls 1n Ma1ne, rather than 1mpo1t eng1neer1ng and technology and hulls from 
overseas The opportmnlty 1s b1g A 1 GW farm Wlll requ1re approxlmately 60 hulls worth $1 b1ll1on dollars 
European and As1an governments have rlghtfully already heavlly subs1d1zed the1r developers, englneers and 
technology leaders to compete m th1s 1ndustry 
We would l1ke to suggest fnendly amendments to the b1ll so that Mame does not outsource 1ts englneerrng and 
technology and fabrlcatlon from overseas Th1s b1ll has unlque opporttmlty to strengthen Ma1ne’s engmeenng and 
technology leadershlp, keep us as leaders 1n the ﬂoatlng W1nd space, and we would appreclate the opportunlty to 
work W1th you to do so 
For example, language can be added to the b1ll so that potentlal developers can be both 1ncent1v1zed and evaluated 
on tl1e1r use of locally developed and produced hull technologres, such as UMa1ne's VolturnUS hull, thelr use of 
local Mame teams to deslgn and fabncate and ma1nta1n the hulls, the1r mvestment 1n Ma1ne h1gher educat1onal 
1nst1tut1ons to develop the local englneermg workforce, and to conduct local Research and Development W1th 
these prov1s1ons added to the b111, Mame can ma1nta1n1ts technology leadershlp 1n ﬂoat1ng wlnd R&D, bu1ld on 
1ts techmcal and eng1neer1ng leadershlp 1n th1s space, and create the engmeermg and technology _]ObS that dnve 
our economy 
And the prlze 1s b1g Malners spend $4-$6 b1ll1on per year on fossll fuels, and most of these dollars leave our 
statel Our goal 1s to deslgn, bu1ld, deploy, and mamtaln hulls usmg Mame engmeers, Mame labors, and Mame 
technology

3. A Historic Perspectlve 
The Offshore Wlnd Resource: 
Ma1ne has one of the best offshore 
w1nd resources 1n the US The Gulf 
of Mame (GOM) has nearly 156 GW 
of offshore w1nd capaclty w1th1n 50 
m11es of the coast If we harnessed 
_]ust 3% of that resource, that 1s 3% 
of the GOM area, we can electrlfy 
heatlng and transportat1on The only 
thlng 1s that we have very deep 
Waters off our coast, and we need toi
