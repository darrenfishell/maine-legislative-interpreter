Re: Testimony in Opposition to L.D. 1895: An Act Regarding the 
Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wind Resources  
 
 
 
Dear Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and Members of the Joint 
Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology  
 
The Maine Coast Fishermen's Association (MCFA)  is an industry -based nonprofit dedicated to restoring 
the fisheries of the Gu lf of Maine and preserving Maine's iconic fishing communities for future 
generations. As an organization founded and led by Maine fishermen, our objectives encompass 
providing a voice for fishing communities, rebuilding the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, and sup porting 
diverse fishing businesses across the state.  
 
MCFA makes  every effort to engage deeply and constructively  in the offshore energy development sector. 
MCFA actively participated in the Maine Offshore Wind Road Map Fisheries Working Group and holds 
a position on the board of the Offshore Wind Research Consortium. Our staff and fishermen part ner on 
research projects esteemed institutions like the University of Maine, Department of Marine Resources, 
Gulf of Maine Research Institute, and Colby College. These collaborative efforts focus on assessing the 
short and long -term impacts of offshore wind development on Maine's fishing communities.  
 
With this background, I respectfully express our firm opposition to L.D. 1895: An Act Regarding the 
Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wind Resources, in its current  published form and any updated 
language that may be adopted through an amendment. While MCFA is a fisheries nonprofit, our foremost 
allegiance lies with the Gulf of Maine as an ecosystem. We firmly believe that without thriving fish 
populations, we cannot  sustain our fishermen or fulfill our mission to promote science -based decision 
making, accountable fishing practices, and responsible management for the benefit of future generations.  
 
We harbor concerns that offshore energy development will inflict harm upon our ocean ecosystem. 
Advancing large -scale energy development or procurement should be postponed until we 
comprehensively understand the impacts  of ocean development. The state of Maine has proposed a test 
site off Monhegan and a research array off Portland . Maine citizens deserve to understand what the 
analysis and assessment  of these projects reveal, before the Legislature approves further large -scale 
development.  
 
Maine's fishermen have consistently raised legitimate concerns and questions regarding offshore wind 
development and its potential impacts on their communities, businesses, and the Maine seafood 
economy. These questions remain unanswered. We lack clarity on the specific impacts such development 
will have on the ecosystem, the technology employed, the permissible activities around the se structures, 
and the equitable representation of fishermen in decision -making processes related to ocean utilization.  
 
The Offshore Wind Road Map took significant strides in identifying opportunities and needs within this 
domain, but several critical questions persist. The diligent efforts by the State of Maine, particularly the 
Governor's office and the Department of Marine Resources, have been commendable , but  in attempting 
to address some of these concerns. Answers have  yet to materialize. While the research array and the 
project off Monhegan will eventually shed light on some of these aspects, we also require a more 
 
 
comprehensive understanding of the socioeconomic impacts of offshore energy deve lopment along 
Maine's coast.  
 
In her article "Sacrifice Along the Energy Continuum: A Call for Energy Justice," Diana Hernández aptly 
states, "The ability to meet rising domestic and global energy demands at a reasonable rate often comes 
with environmental  and human costs." We firmly believe that environmental and energy justice begin 
with a thorough comprehension of who will be impacted, both positively and negatively. The authors of 
this bill have invested time crafting a document aiming to mitigate some of the adverse effects of offshore 
energy development . We are grateful for  their considerable efforts. Specifically, we appreciate the 
inclusion of priorities such as responsibly sited offshore wind  energy development, minimization of 
impacts on wildlife, habitat, fisheries, and coastal communities, monitoring of marine environment 
impacts, and the promotion of diversity, equity, inclusion, and equitable distribution of economic 
benefits.  
 
 Without the  requisite information to make informed judgments and weigh offshore wind development 
proposals , we cannot in good conscience support L.D. 1895, given our role as stewards of the ocean 
ecosystem  and Maine’s s mall businesses. We also contend that this  bill fails to equip the Public Utilities 
Commission (PUC) with the necessary tools, knowledge, and representation to appropriately adjudicate 
proposals, assess benefit packages, evaluate ecosystem and community impacts, and gauge technology 
suitability.  
 
Maine boasts the highest number of boats undertaking fishing trips in the contiguous United States. 
Offshore wind develop ment possesses the potential to significantly disrupt the marine ecosystem and 
Maine's fishing communities if it is not done correctly. In our haste to deploy unproven and uncertain 
technology on our waters, we risk losing sight of the tremendous opportuni ties and food resources that 
our ecosystem offers to Maine's fishermen, seafood enthusiasts, and all of Maine’s citizens. Irrespective 
of individual perspectives on developing the Gulf of Maine for energy production, it is imperative that we 
comprehend the  potential impacts of this transition and adequately support affected communities in 
grappling with the consequences of such development.  
 
In conclusion, we oppose L.D. 1895: An Act Regarding the Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wind 
Resources, in its c urrent form and any updated language that falls short of providing the PUC with the 
essential tools, knowledge, and representation needed to evaluate proposals comprehensively. We 
implore you to reconsider the bill and ensure that we have a complete unders tanding of the potential 
impacts of offshore wind development before proceeding.  
 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. We greatly appreciate your dedication and commitment to 
the well -being of Maine's coastal communities and its invaluable natural resources. Should you require 
any further information please do not hesitate to contact me . 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
 
Ben Martens  
Executive Director
