Good evening my name is Matt Gilley I’m a lobsterman from Harpswell. I’m not 
represented by the mla mlu nefsa or any other organization. I represent 5 dozen 
fisherman on the zone f council. My concern to siting the arrays further out of lma 1 
is based on my maine concern with the arrays overall. There was study done by 
Herriot Watt university in the United Kingdom showing lobsters exposed to 
underwater cables were four times more likely to develop swimming deformities. 
https://phys.org/news/2022-04-underwater-power-cables-lobsters-bad.amp. There 
have been other studies 
https://partner.sciencenorway.no/fish-fish-behaviour-fish-health/magnetic-fields-from
-subsea-cables-can-slow-down-haddock-larvae/2077928 done in Norway showing 
that these cables slow haddock larva swimming ability making it more susceptible to 
predators. Block island wind has ran into problems trying to bury the cable only a 
short distance. This increase has been passed into rate payers who pay the highest 
rates in the country. Dominion Wind is threatening to pull their project if costs can’t 
be passed to ratepayers. Mainers who already use some of the most renewable energy 
in the nation but still pay some of the highest rates can’t afford to pay for offshore 
winds unproven track record. The Coast guard has already expressed concerns about 
rescues within the array because radar interference and the inability to operate a 
helicopter within the array. The gulf of maine is the states most valuable asset. A 
study by the island institute in maine showed that for every dollar the fishing industry 
generates it generates $8 on land. The lobster industry alone is a $1 billion industry 
that’s almost $8 billion it contributes to maines gdp. That’s 1/8 of the states entire 
gdp. Do we want to sacrifice maines fishing history and heritage for an unproven 
technology. I hope not. Thank you.
