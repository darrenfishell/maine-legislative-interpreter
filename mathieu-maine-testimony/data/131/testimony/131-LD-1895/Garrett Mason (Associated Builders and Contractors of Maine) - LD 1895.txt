Testnmony of Garrett Mason 
|n Oppos|t|on to LD 1895 
“An Act Regardmg the Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wmd Resources" 
Senator Lawrence, Representatlve Zelgler, and members of the Jo|nt Standmg Comm|ttee on 
Energy Ut|l|t|es and Technology My name IS Garrett Mason and I'm here on behalf of my cl|ent 
the Assoclated BUlldEl‘S and Contractors of Ma|ne On behalf of our 182 members who employ 
over 2,500 people we are testnfymg today |n oppos|t|on to LD 1895 
As Mame contmues to pursue a carbon neutral energy future by 2040 there are many energy 
sources bemg cons|dered as potent|al replacements for carbon based energy sources It'sa 
lofty goal, but one that our mdustry |s ready to help reach Part ofthat carbon neutral future for 
Mame |s off shore w|nd As there are for every energy productnon method there IS debate 
around the envlronmental and cost elements of off shore wmd However one element that 
doesn't need debate |s the enormous beneﬁt to Ma|ne's constructnon mdustry and the 
workforce that w|ll be needed to bunld and ma|nta|n these projects As both the State and 
Federal governments ready themselves to grant leases we need all hands on deck for th|s 
|ncred|ble undertakmg 
However, as we have seen multlple tlmes |n th|s sesslon, thus seems to be another |n a serues of 
b|lls that, e|ther knowmgly or unknowlngly, |s a|med at d|scr|m|nat|ng agalnst the 90% of 
Ma|ne's construct|on mdustry that has chosen to not jo|n a umon As one of Ma|ne's largest 
constructlon Industry organlzatlons and a chlef advocate ofthe Merlt Shop phllosophy we have 
great concerns about the prov|s|ons |n th|s blll that requlre and promote Project Labor 
Agreements and Labor Peace Agreements The bottom lune |s that many of our member 
compames slmply w|ll not b|d on a project that mandates these agreements The labor shortage 
w|ll be greater than |t already |s and these projects w|ll be awarded to out of state compames 
Proponents of project labor agreements w|ll tell you that anyone IS free to b|d for a project 
Whlle that may be true a PLA makes |t |ncred|bly dnfﬁcult and nearly |mposs|ble for those who 
have chosen not to jom a un|on For the compames and theur employees that are not 
slgnatorles to a PLA |ts s|mply easler to bud for and wm work that doesn't mclude these 
prov|s|ons PLAs carve out work for a small set of contractors that operate under a dnfferent 
model Because ofthe enormnty of the project |n front of us mcludmg th|s provlslon as a polson 
pull sugnuﬁcantly hampers the ab|l|ty of the State to complete these projects on tnme and w|th|n 
budget 
Proponents w|ll also tell you that PLAs mcrease safety and tra|n workforce for the future Well, 
there us more than one way to cook an egg ABC applauds any program that IS tralnmg next 
generatlon workforce and we would expect others to have the same apprec|at|on for alternate 
programs ABC |s |n the th|rd year of our reglstered apprent|cesh|p program wnth the state Our
members have apprent|cesh|p programs of the|r own that we are proud to promote We also 
have on-the-jobtra|n|ng programs and other state sanctloned trammg programs that prepare 
the workforce of the future Some w|ll attempt to lmply that these programs that have worked 
and been applauded for years should now be v|ewed as |nfer|or slmply because they aren't 
the|rs We thmk that I5 mcredulous and d|scr|m|natory Not to us - but to our members and 
the|r employees 
PLAs also are documented t|me and t|me agann to mcrease costs on state and federal projects 
anywhere from 12-20% There are examples all around the country of projects that have had 
enormous cost overruns because of the seemmgly mnocuous |nclus|on of PLAs Into a b|d 
requlrement There |s no questuon that the cost to bu|ld out the Infrastructure for large scale off 
shore wlnd w|ll be expenslve ABC quest|ons the w|sdom of |nclud|ng a prov|s|on that would 
cost the taxpayers more As we all know, money |s not |nf|n|te The |nclus|on of a PLA w|ll lead 
to fewer projects be|ng completed at hlgher costs 
As Mame heads towards a clean energy future we should be usmg all the tools at our drsposal 
Th|s b|ll w|ll tle the hands of the State and eI|m|nate the part|c|pat|on of many upstand|ng 
Ma|ne compames We hope th|s comm|ttee w|ll vote ”ought not to pass" on th|s b|ll 
Thank you and I'd be happy to answer any quest|ons you may have or prov|de answers I do not 
for work sesslon
