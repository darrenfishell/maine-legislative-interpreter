Offshore wind farms is a bad idea in any area. We've spent years preserving species 
along the coast. What's the response time when something happens? What if it's a bad 
day out and you can't safely get to the farm? How long will you have to shut us down 
because of your destruction to our waters? This is our heritage. This is how we keep 
food on the table. You have no sources to back up your wants. It's not tangible. We 
don't want it in our lobster areas.
