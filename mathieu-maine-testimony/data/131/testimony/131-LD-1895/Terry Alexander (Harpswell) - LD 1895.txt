Terry Alexander 
TestImony In support of LD 1895 
I am Terry Alexander and am a trawler ﬁsherman from Harpswell, MaIne I have spent 46 years ﬁshIng In 
the Gulf of MaIne I am currently the co-chaIr of the Research Consorﬁum on offshore wInd I also co- 
chalred the FIsherIes WorkIng Group In the Offshore WInd Roadmap process 
WIth lots of reluctance the group chose the lobster management area 1 (LMA1) |Ine as a compromIse 
because no one In the group thought It Is a good Idea That beIng sald, I am here to support the lIne In 
LD 1895 because It follows the advlce of the FIsherIes WorkIng Group We met 80 tImes over 2 years to 
come to thIs compromIse 
ThIs lIne protects several dlfferent ﬁsherIes that are Important to MaIne ﬁshermen HerrIng, Northern 
Gulf of MaIne scallop, Lobster, Dayboat and Glllnet Groundﬁsh, Tuna and the whItIng ﬁshery all operate 
In area 1 All of these ﬁsherIes create good paymgjobs for the men and woman of all our coastal 
communIt1es The lIne protects lots of areas of essentIal ﬁsh habItat and spawnIng areas 
FIshIng IS an Important part of our hIstory along the MaIne coast In my town of Harpswell I belIeve we 
hold more lobster lIcenses than any other town In the state I belleve that number Is 264 Ifl remember 
rIght and that doesn't count all the other permIts In town 
Lots of areas of essentlal ﬁsh habItat are protected 
It's a known management lIne and doesn't hInder other states from makIng sImIlar rules on theIr coasts 
Ifyou look at the chart of the Gulf of MaIne you wIll realIze jLISt how lIttle of the Gulf thIs takes out of the 
equatIon The worry Is we wIll push the developer to move to another state and try to get It moved 
closer They wIll run Into the same ﬁshIng operatIons there That Is already off the table when BOEM cut 
the call area down In the ﬁrst round I know we ﬁsh all the way to areas off the coast of New Jersey 
chasIng ﬁsh and squId 
The furthest polnt offshore of area 1 Is around 50 mIles from MaIne In Southern New England one of 
the cables to shore IS 172 mlles long so the dIstance from shore Is not hIndrance In buIldIng an offshore 
wInd farm 
I belIeve that thIs bIlI passIng Is a vote to protect the ﬁshIng Industry because no matter what we thInk, 
Offshore wInd IS comIng to the Gulf of Mame and thIs bIll makes It affect a lot less people durIng 
constructIon I say that because there are at least 1600 permIts allowed to ﬁsh In the Gulf of MaIne for 
dIfferent specles and 90 percent of that actIvIty takes place In area 1 Once you pass that lIne the ﬂeet of 
boats -- of whIch I am one -- that ﬁshes outsIde that lIne IS much smaller Most of the people that ﬁsh 
further off also ﬁsh In area 1 We chase the ﬁsh wherever they go My hope Is that wIth a much smaller 
group we can work closely wIth the developer to mInImIze the Impacts on ﬁshermen, ﬁsh and habItat 
outsIde area1
