My famIly IS a multI-generahonal MaIne FamIly Both my parents were UnIon Members, my 
wIfe and I are as well There are many beneﬁts offshore wInd w|ll brIng to Mame both 
envIronmentally and economIcally One beneﬁt I know for sure IS that of the fInancIaI wIn for 
MaIne consntuents, for when we expand the opportunIty for local people to not only joIna 
unIon but enjoy plentIfuI employment, we change the economIc future of that constItuent's 
communIty The IIfe my famIIy leads and the opportunItIes my k|ds have, IIe In my unIon 
membersh|p I can only begIn to descrIbe what thIs has meant to me and how I have devoted 
my IIfe to makIng sure others have that same opportunIty 
In my teshmony I would |Ike to talk about my lIfe and how unIon membersh|p has helped 
myjourney to who I am today When I graduated hIgh school, ljoIned Ironworkers local 7I 
was a man wrthout plan, I enjoyed the outdoors and workIng wIth my hands I was enrolled In 
Local 7's Apprent1ceshIp Program where I learned the Sl<|llS I would need to excel In my ﬁeldI 
worked for multIple employers whIle havIng all my beneﬁts stay wIth me On top of thatI 
worked In states as far away as HawaII wIth all my beneﬁts such as pensIon, 401k and health 
Insurance always folIowIng me No matter who the sIgnatory contractor was As I aged, startIng 
a famIly and settlIng down became a prIorIty FIrst, we bought an apartment buIldIng In 
Portland, MaIne and then a house In South BerwIck I was able to do all thIs because I worked 
for years In Massachusetts The begInnIng of my own famIIy In MaIne, a state I am from, would 
not have been possIbIe Ifl had not left for better pay In Massachusetts I worked 5 years 
straIght on PLA projects, prlvate and pubIIc (WhIttIer BrIdge Replacements, Salem Harbor 
Powerhouse, and the Encore Casmo) Every year I earned close to or upwards of sIx ﬁgures,I 
put a robust amount Into my 401 k and receuved 2 pensnon credIts per year due to all the 
overtIme I worked ThIs IS what we can brIng to MaIne for MaIne workers The Agreements 
(PLA's) I worked under had language that Included not only local hIre but dIversIty, equrty, and 
IncIusIon standards to the poInt of whrch the ConstructIon Manager guaranteed certaIn 
percentages from dIsadvantaged populatlons by creatIng a posIt1on to hold every sub-contractor
accountable to the standards in the agreement PLA's are good for workers, good for the 
community and good for this State 
What this bill also does is protect one of Maines most iconic industries, the commercial 
fishing industry, namely Iobstermen and women The LMA 1 one exclusion has support from 
fisheries who have ﬁshed the waters of the coast of Maine for generations Before telephones, 
the combustion engine, the diesel locomotive and the there were Iobstermen and women here 
ﬁshing the Gulf of Maine I fully support the LMA 1 language in this bill as it keeps Maines 
identity itself intact You cannot be a multi-generational Mainer without having a family 
member or a couple dozen in the ﬁshing community here It is in our heritage My family has 
been Maine Guides, wood cutters, logging camp cooks, mechanics, teachers, |ronworkers and 
ﬁsherman in this state for generations Vast amounts of my close friends have been or are 
Iobstering Members of this committee have ﬁshed commercially and may again someday We 
can have responsibly sited projects that decarbonize Maine without putting the lively hoods of 
the men and women who work on the water in jeopardy 
Maine has displayed great leadership in its dedication to addressing climate change It is 
time for the state to show it IS equally committed to reducing inequality, closing the race and 
gender wealth gap, and building a clean energy economy that allows residents to thrive with 
good _|ObS and healthy communities PLA's and LPA's for Offshore Wind and Port Infrastructure 
provide a blueprint for Maine to help abate climate change, support and protect high-quality 
j0bS, confront inequality, and ensure that frontline communities have access to high-quality 
clean energyjobs Commercial scale offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine is an opportunity to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create many good _|ObS, and build stronger, healthier 
communities throughout the state Implementing these recommendations will put Maine ona 
path to achieving its climate goals while meeting important ]Ob and equity objectives Mainers 
need to see how executing the state's climate plans will enhance residents ’ lives by creating 
high-quality union j0bS, lowering energy bills, and cultivating a healthier environment 
Offshore Wind is an Opportunity for Maine to do something historic and we can do it 
together Today at this hearing you have heard testimony from our amazing coalition A group 
representing Environmental Organizations, Labor Unions, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Parties, 
Youth Climate Action Groups and the Fishing Industry You heard from Mainers, you heard from 
Maine All our concerns align to one core message, Offshore Wind is good for Maine and should 
be done responsibly, we stand ready to assist that mission We hold ourselves accountable to 
work the long hours, to make the hard decisions, and to make sure voices that have not been 
heard have their day We do not check boxes, we engage and are proud to work collectively 
with anyone, it only strengthens our movement Along the way we will not settle for watered 
down actions or results, there are too many depending on us to get this right Our coalition has 
done some incredible work moving this legislation before the committee today, now you must 
decide what the best course for Maine I trust this committee to vote ought to pass and usher 
in the next chapter in Maine resilience
