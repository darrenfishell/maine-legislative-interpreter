LD 1895 An Act Regarding the Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wmd Resources 
Senator Lawrence, Representatwe Zeugler, and the esteemed members of the commuttee on 
Energy, Utllmes and Technology 
The burmng of foss|l fuels, and rellance on envnronmentally destructlve mega dams, to produce 
e|ectr|c|ty |s a slgmﬁcant dr|ver of the global‘ clnmate emergency, w|th adverse effects on 
frontlme commumtles A rapnd transltlon to clean renewable energy |s lmperatlve |f we are to 
avo|d the catastrophrc effects of runaway clnmate change, effects wh|ch w|ll devastate Ma|ne's 
economy, and our umque ecology Offshore w|nd |s one of our greatest opportun|t|es to protect 
Ma|ne's prospenty 
My name IS Scott Vlaun I am the executlve durector of the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy 
(CEBE) m Norway, Mame I'm here today |n support of LD1895, An Act Regard/ng the 
Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wmd Resources 
CEBE has been hard at work for the last ten years to ra|se awareness of the clnmate cr|s|s and 
help our rural area adapt to the acceleraung lmpacts of cl|mate change, lmpacts wh|ch are 
already adversely affectmg our envlronment and placmg an lncreasmg burden on our 
mun|c|pal|t|es and local economy In a reguon so dependent on tourlsm assoclated wlth our once 
prlstme lakes and forests, as well as a relrable wmter snowpack and |ce on our lakes, the 
collapse of once relnable weather patterns poses great r|sk We are |n a global cl|mate 
emergency, yes, but It us a local emergency 
We are fortunate to l|ve |n Mame where our forward-th|nk|ng government has developed a 
robust cl|mate 8Cl'IOl‘l plan and has begun to provnde asslstance to rural mun|c|pal|t1esl|ke those 
that my organlzatlon works w|th as a Serv|ce Provuder for Ma|ne's Communlty Resulnence 
Partnershlp Wh|le a step |n the rnght d|rect|on, thls fundmg |s but a drop |n the bucket |n the 
face of the adaptatlon measures that w||l be requnred to adapt to acceleratmg clnmate change, 
and also do our part to help m|t|gate the cr|s|s 
To that end, our area has seen an exploslon m the development of solar power, wh|ch my 
orgamzatlon embraces, but we are also seemg a lot of blowback on thus as commercial solar 
developers have run roughshod over local commun|t|es, often srtmg mstallatrons wnthout 
commumty mput and careful COl‘1SlC|8l'8tIOl1 of rmportant ecologncal factors 
Terrestrnal w|nd deployment here IS also controverslal as |t often mvolves bu|ld|ng roads |nto 
pr|st|ne areas and has m|n|mal commumty support The fact |s that rural western Mame, wh|le 
dorng Its part, cannot become a sacrlﬁce zone m Ma|ne's transltlon to renewable energy, 
especnally consudermg that much of Maine's electncal consumpuon |s |n our c|t|es and more 
afﬂuent coastal areas 
The t|me for rapnd deployment of offshore w|nd |s now Th|s source of clean, renewable and 
relnable energy dwarfs any other resource we have avanlable, and w|ll put Mame on the roadto
energy Independence whIle keepmg bIllIons of dollars at work In the state's economy LD 1895 
moves us dramatlcally In the rIght dIrectIon, buIldIng on the work of broad coalItIons across 
ﬁshenes, labor, renewable energy advocates and c|Imate actIvIsts Th|s Important bIll wlth Its 
unprecedented emphasIs on equIty and InclusIon Is a g|ant step for MaIne's future energy 
securIty In the wanIng days of the fossll fuel era and wIlI represent a sIgnIﬁcant contrIbutIon In 
the ﬁght agaInst global clImate change It wIll also set a hIgh standard for offshore wlnd 
development elsewhere Please vote ought to pass on LD1895
