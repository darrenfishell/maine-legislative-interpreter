Re Testlmony 1n Support of LD 1895- An Act Regarding the Procurement of Energy from 
Oﬁshore Wmd ResourcesI 
Senator Lawrence, Representatlve Zlegler, and members of the Energy, Ut1l1t1es, and Technology 
Commlttee, I am testlfylng on behalf of Slerra Club Mame, representlng over 22,000 supporters and 
members statewlde Founded 1n 1892, Slerra Club 1s one of our nat1on's oldest and largest 
envlronmental organlzatlons We strlve to ampllfy the power of our 3 8 mllhon members 
natlon-wlde as we work towards combatlng cllmate change and promotlng a ]ust and sustamable 
economy To that end, we urge you to vote ‘ought to pass’ on L D 1895 
The urgency of the cllmate cr1s1s requlres that we act swlftly to sustamably generated energy 
However, we must ensure that the transltlon 1s completed 1n a ]l1St and equltable way L D 1895 1sa 
crltlcal plece to the puzzle for Mame If lmplemented, 1t would strengthen Ma1ne's economy by 
stab1l1z1ng energy costs and creatmg thousands of new famlly-supportmg, clean energy ]0bS 
through the procurement of offshore wlnd energy, wh1le also responslbly sltmg turbmes 1n the Gulf 
of Mame 1n order to protect w1ld11fe, avold Impacts to local lobsterlng and flshlng commumtles, and 
protect th1s shared resource for future generatlons 
The Slerra Club strongly supports the development of substantlal wmd resources for electrlclty 
generatlon Wmd power 1s a rehable, clean, renewable resource that can help reduce our 
dependence on pollutmg fossll fuels (coal, 011, and natural gas) and nuclear power for electr1c1ty1 
The Gulf of Mame IS the best offshore w1nd resource area 1n the eastern US, wlth the ultlmate 
potentlal of tens of glgawatts of wmd generatlon capacltyz The consequences of our contmued 
dependence on burmng fossll fuels for electrlclty lnclude global warmlng, acld ram, smog, 
ﬂammable accldents, mcreased lncldence of asthma and other resplratory dlseases, and other forms 
of pollutlon and natural resource damage, lncludmg mountalntop removal and strlp mlnlng 
Thls b1ll and the sponsor's amendment also ensure our transltlon to renewable energy 1s done justly 
w1th the lncluslon of the labor peace agreement sectlon and the estabhshment of the Flshmg 
Communlty Protectlon and Low—Income Ratepayer Fund used to 1ncent1v1ze the sltmg of w1nd 
pro]ect to avold confllct w1th commerclal f1sher1es 1n the Gulf of Mame and related human uses of 
the State's submerged lands as well as asslst low-mcome ratepayers

Though as wrltten thls blll refers to the s1t1ng of turblnes, and not of port lI1fI‘8StI‘l1Ctl1I‘8, the Slerra 
Club would llke to see ll'1ClU.(l8d 1n thls legzslatlon or future l8glSlEltl0I ‘l language, the sltlng of 
onshore manufactunng, assembllng and l8l1I1Cl'1lI1gf8Cllltl8S, uslng the same hlgh envlronmental, 
equlty, and labor standards as proposed for the offshore wlnd ﬂoatlng turblnes 1n L D 1895 Th1s 
could be achleved 1n th1s b1ll by lnsertmg the term ‘and related 1nfrastructure' to the def1n1t1on of 
offshore w1nd power pr0]ects 1n Sectlon E. of the blll Our lntentlon here 1s to focus development 1n 
the least envlronmentally harmful areas posslble or areas that have already been developed, 1n 
order to protect undeveloped land as much as posslble, as recommended 1n the latest IPCC report 
and Malne Won't Walt 
L D 1895 lncludes strong standards to bulld h1gh~qual1ty career pathways, protect Ma1ne's 
envlronment, and ensure economlc beneﬁts to many Mame communltles We urge the commlttee to 
vote ‘ought to pass’ Thank you for your tlme and conslderatlon
