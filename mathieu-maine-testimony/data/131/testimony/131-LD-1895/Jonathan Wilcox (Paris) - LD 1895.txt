LD 1895
Dear EUT Committee Chair and Members,
I am writing to express my support for LD 1895, which aims to develop offshore 
wind power in the Gulf of Maine. I believe that this bill will help stabilize energy 
costs, create cleaner, cheaper energy than fossil fuels, create clean energy jobs, 
protect the environment for future generations, and even lower the risk of war.  
Maine's floating wind platform being developed at the University of Maine (Orono) 
can be key to our future energy independence, improved economy, healthier for the 
state, and lead in environmental and energy sustainability.  By utilizing wind power 
off the coast of Maine, including deep water floating platforms, there is estimated 
400% more energy available than what we require today, which is sustainable, 
renewable, and newly revealed wind turbine blade technology has recyclable options 
(C&EN Global Enterprise 2022 100 (27), 26-30, DOI:10.1021/cen-10027-cover), 
making it a technology that is nearly 100% recyclable.  Wind energy is something we 
can grow with.
I believe we should work toward building a new, home-grown clean, electron-based 
energy source that Maine can be proud of.  By setting clear goals and a schedule for 
Maine to buy offshore wind power, this bill will signal to developers that Maine is 
serious about offshore wind, helping stimulate billions in private sector investment in 
our workforce, ports, businesses, and communities.  (Please do everything you can to 
move away from fossil fuel use, subsidies, exploration, etc. as soon as possible.)  We 
have  an opportunity to lead the nation in an electron-based economy that is healthier 
for all citizens and all life on Earth with which we are a part of.
I urge you to support LD 1895, thank you,
Jonathan Wilcox
