I am writing in support of this bill.  I believe if wind power is coming to the gulf of 
maine, then we must take the necessary steps to ensure that it is done in a responsible 
manner; and that means no construction within LMA1.  Incentivizing union labor 
contracts, whoâ€™ve tied their support to the fishing industry will provide economic 
benefits to our state.  
No one wants wind power where we fish, and I believe this bill will help keep the 
future of our state and LMA1 waters free from turbines.
