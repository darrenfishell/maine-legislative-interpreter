LD 1895
As your constituent, I am writing to express my strong support for LD 1985, which is 
based on the primary recommendations in Maine's Offshore Wind Roadmap.  This 
legislation, which supports the generation of energy from offshore wind resources, 
will strengthen Maine's economy by creating thousands of new high-quality jobs and 
by stabilizing energy costs through reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels. At 
the same time, it would require important labor protections and provide benefits for 
Maine's most vulnerable communities. LD 1985 also sets high standards for 
monitoring effects on wildlife, fisheries, and the environment.   The wind in the Gulf 
of Maine is one of the strongest and most consistent winds in the world. We have an 
opportunity and a responsibility to develop this renewable energy resource with 
consideration for the environment and for vulnerable communities.
