I am for LD 1895
I do not want Wind farms at all. if there needs to be any they need to be outside 
LMA1. It would be a detriment to any lobstering area including LMA1 to reduce 
income by 80%. This is Maines income. Maines economy would be severely hurt and 
also the federal government.. we will all have to go on a state aid..  emergency aid.
