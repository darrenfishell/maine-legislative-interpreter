LD 1895 ought-NOT-to pass. 
Haven't we learned anything from what's happening to the whales off the coast of 
New Jersey likely as a result of constructing the turbine platforms? In addition these 
turbines will eventually leak oil and will likely kill sea life off the pristine coast of 
Maine. 
Thank you.
