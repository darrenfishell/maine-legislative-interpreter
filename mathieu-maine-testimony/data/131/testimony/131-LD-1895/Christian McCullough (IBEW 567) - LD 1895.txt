Testimony lrom Christian McCullough, in Support oi L.l). 1895, "An Act Regarding the 
Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wmd Resources ” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Energy, Utilities, and Technology, my name 1S Christian McCullough and I’m here 
today to speak in favor of L D 1895 I’m an electrician, l'in a member of IBEW 567, and 
I live in Aubum 
Bom and raised right in Auburn I have worked numerous jobs and been part ofa 
great community Graduating from Edward Little in 2009, Enlisting into the Army 
National Guard in 2012 and then serving until 2020 I have seen changes both good and 
bad in our state 
Today we are all here to talk about the Offshore Wind Project This isn’t only 
beneﬁcial for the state, but 1t’s beneﬁcial for my brothers and sisters of local 567 and 
local 1253 This project will bring plenty of work for years to come and will only 
improve as it moves forward This will guarantee more families to stay in the state vs 
traveling across state lines to ﬁnd other electrical work Not only 1S it good for us, it will 
be good for Searsport and surrounding towns as we help boost their economy’s by 
shopping and spending money there for lunch, lodging, and more 
So far Solar has been a great thing for this state by helping reduce our carbon 
footprint and combating climate issues As time and technology change, so do our views 
on how to improve the climate crisis even more If we all want a better future for our 
families and children then now 1S the time to act upon it Let’s lead the country in a giant 
project like this and make Offshore Wind a stepping stone in making the planet a better 
place 
You want good work and top quality results‘? You put this work in the hands of our 
Union and we will get the job done correctly and efficiently You want poor work and 
mediocre results‘? You pass it off to non union workers who don’t carry the proper 
licensing and training to give you great end results If you look at our Apprenticeship 
program you’ll realize that our Older J oumeyman are passing on their Skills and 
Knowledge to the younger generations who will continue to get better and pass that on as 
new classes come in 4 years of school and 8,000 hours of On The Job Training is what 
separates us from the non union division 
All eyes are on you at this point and its up to you to make not only the smart 
decision, but the right decision 
Thank you for your time
