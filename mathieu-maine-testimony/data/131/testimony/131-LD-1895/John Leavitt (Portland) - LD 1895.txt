Good Afternoon, Senate Chair Lawrence, Representative Chair Zeigler, and members of the Energy, Utilities, 
and technology Committee and Thank you for hearing this extremely important bill.  
 
Offshore Wind is a global market and State of Maine is a desired location for many offshore wind developers to 
grow. With your help we have an opportunity to establish working guidelines in a new industry that could 
support working people and their families for many decades.  
 
As you see many trades, businesses, and communities have worked together to present this bill which represents 
the families of your constituents who will be directly impacted on how these projects are outlined.  
 
LD 1895 falls in line with the Governors Offshore Wind Roadmap and provides long term careers for the 
working people in Maine stemming from the research array which is being engineered with the University of 
Maine Orono campus.  
 
This bill includes the need for training a diverse workforce for long-term careers while protecting inland 
fisheries, wildlife, and accounting for port upgrades that work within the community directly affected.  The 
ultimate benefit to the people of Maine is offshore wind turbines will provide a much-needed alternative energy 
source that is safe for our families and will provide a less oil dependent community while offering an economic 
boost.  
 
I am happy to answer any questions and I urge you to support LD 1895 as written and I thank you for your time 
and consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
John Leavitt
