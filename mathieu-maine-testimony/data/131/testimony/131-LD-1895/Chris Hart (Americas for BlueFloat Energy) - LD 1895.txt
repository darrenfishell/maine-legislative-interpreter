Good afternoon 
My name Is ChrIs Hart and I am the V|ce PresIdent of the AmerIcas for BlueFloat Energy 
BlueFloat IS a global offshore wInd developer wIth one of the largest pIpelInes of projects In the world 
That pIpeIIne IS almost 25 GW globally and Is splIt between APAC, Europe and the AmerIcas 
In 2022, Wood MackenzIe Identlﬁed BlueFloat as the fastest-growIng offshore wInd developer In the 
world 
About 90% of our developments globally are ﬂoatIng, and we consIder our expertIse In the technIcal 
aspects of ﬂoatIng offshore wInd as one of our competItIve advantages, along wIth our entrepreneurIal 
culture and the support ofour world-class owners 
Although I lIve In Houston, |t's always a pleasure for me to come back to MaIne 
In a way, my offshore wInd journey started In MaIne when the team I led at the US Department of Energy 
provIded seed fundIng to Dr Dagher and the UnIversIty of MaIne as part of our Offshore WInd 
DemonstratIon Projects effort back In 2010 
My brother graduated from MaIne MarItIme Academy and my sIster-In-law was raIsed Down East In 
AddIson 
S0, It Is a pleasure to be here wIth you today, testIfyIng In support of LD1895 
There Is a lot to lIke about the bIll and we applaud your efforts to act decIsIvely and send a sIgnal to the 
market that MaIne Is open for offshore wInd In part1cular, we apprecIate the followIng elements 
1 II A procurement t1melIne that Is allgned wIth the lease auctIon process A gap between the 
BOEM lease auctIon process and the procurement process can add unnecessary InefﬁcIencIes 
and uncertaIntIes from a developer's perspectlve , 
2 1| A mandated cadence between successIve procurements SImIlarly, thIs Is somethIng that gIves 
certaInty to project developers and Increases the ”bankabIlIty" of a geography 
3 ]l Mandated mInImum procurement targets, but no maxImum We have seen thIs lead toa 
sustaIned level of Interest from the development communIty In other markets 
4 II Clearly arhculated evaluatlon crIterIa and bId requIrements CertaInty Is the goal here from the 
developer's perspect1ve 
5 II An offshore wInd transm|ss|ons procurement BlueFloat sees thIs as the largest hurdle to 
overcome for the Gulf of MaIne market The InclusIon of thIs procurement from the begInnIng Is 
an IndIcatIon that the State Is consIderIng It and payIng attentIon to lessons learned from other 
markets 
WIth that bemg saId, there are other elements of the bIll that we apprecIate are stIll under development, 
namely 
a ) Coordmatlon wIth other New England States On one hand, coordInat1on wIth neIghborIng 
jurIsdIctIons can add unwanted complexIty and lengthen tImelInes On the other hand, It can 
grow markets and breakdown barrIers, partIcularly, In thIs case, when It comes to transmIssIon
\
We would add that coordmaﬁon wlth your nelghbors to the north would also be a worthwh|le 
conslderauon 
b ) Evaluatnon cr|ter|a Based on our experlence, we see that the 40% level for commumty and 
natural resource beneﬁts IS hlgh Of course, developers w|ll propose projects that conform to 
the mandated evaluatlon cr|ter|a, but It IS our experlence that th|s hlgh ofa "non-ratepayer" 
beneﬁt can ca use stakeholder fat1gue and therefore problems w|th the long-term v|ab|||ty of the 
market 
c ) B|d requlrements S|m||arly, mcludlng an expl|c|t $/MW commltment to the Renewable Ocean 
Energy Trust and the Jushce Fund WhIC|'I totals to over $50M over the llfe of the procurement IS 
an approach that could create unwanted fr|ct|on w|th the commumty and thereby threaten the 
long-term v|ab|l|ty of the market 
d ) Offshore w|nd transmlsslon procurement Wh|le the mcluslon of th|s language In the blll ISa 
good ﬁrst step, It needs to be better-de ﬁned over tlme Currently, the language ralses many 
questlons about the mechanlcs of the procurement, and we trust that those questlons w|ll be 
answered In due course 
I would l|ke to close by referencmg the wrltten testlmony that I provlded 
You w|ll notlce on the last two pages, 39 and 40, there are some lessons-learned from our experlence In 
European markets On sl|de 40 In partlcular IS a case study from the French market On th|s sllde you 
w|ll notlce pr|ce caps for the varlous Rounds and also a callout In the lower rlght corner that hlghllghts 
some of the posltlve attrlbutes from the approach that the French have taken 
I hope you ﬁnd these materlal useful and helpful and I y|eld the ﬂoor In case there are any quest1ons that 
I can answer
