LD 1895
My Name is Sheila Dassatt and I represent the Downeast Lobstermen's Association. 
In reference to LD 1895, we are opposed to this bill. Upon reading how this bill is 
presented, it has double meaning. It doesn't seem that folks can protect our marine 
wildlife and in the same breath, be in favor of offshore wind.
It just doesn't work that way.
For years now, the Maine fishermen have been doing everything that we can to 
protect the North American Right Whale. We have never had an entanglement since 
2004, and then the whale survived. 
Now, it seems like the environmentalists also want green energy, which entails 
offshore wind. I was on the Fishermen's working committee when this whole proposal
started. My impression was to try to convince the fishermen to go along with it.  My 
first impression was to tell them that the fishermen are not going to go along with this 
project. There is way too much interference with our marine wildlife, concern for the 
whales and also the birds in the area.
This all came into being, and No, the fishermen are not in favor of offshore wind.  
There is way too much at stake.
I also have not seen the same whale folks making a loud noise about being opposed to
offshore wind.  Where are they now? Do these same people want to risk the whales 
for the sake of offshore wind? How can we live with this double standard? There is 
way too much research that still needs to be considered before this can even be 
considered.
I could go on and on, but we are simply stating that this entire concept is not tried and
true and we are not in favor.
Respectfully,
Sheila H. Dassatt
