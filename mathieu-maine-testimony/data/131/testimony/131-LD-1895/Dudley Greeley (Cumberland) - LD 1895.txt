LD 1895
I write to ask you to support LD 1985.     Good atmospheres are hard to find.  The 
need to stop treating our atmosphere as a gaseous sewer is urgent.  I taught principles 
of sustainable business at the School of Business at USM for nearly a decade.   As I 
refined course content over years of teaching, the need to focus on the benefits of 
powering society with sustainably-produced energy became a clear priority.  Maine 
lost significant opportunities to become an early leader in off-shore wind technology. 
Let’s not hesitate now to adopt this  sensible approach to improve the quality of 
Maine’s energy infrastructure.  As you deliberate, please do not confuse the market 
prices of energy with the true, or total costs.   The external costs of using fossil-fuels 
are now known to be unacceptably high.  Please help stop forcing these costs onto 
current and future generations.  I have two granddaughters too young to weigh-in on 
this matter.  In part, I write on their behalf.  LD 1985 offers movement in a better 
direction.  I am writing as a constituent to express my strong support for LD 1985, 
which builds upon top recommendations from Maine's Offshore Wind Roadmap.  
This legislation to procure energy from offshore wind resources will strengthen 
Maine's economy by creating thousands of new high-quality jobs and stabilizing 
energy costs by reducing our reliance on imported gas and oil. It also sets high 
standards for wildlife, fisheries, and environmental monitoring, while also requiring 
important labor protections and providing benefits for Maine's most vulnerable 
communities.  The Gulf of Maine has some of the strongest and most consistent wind 
in the world, and we have an opportunity to develop this renewable energy resource in
a responsible and equitable way.
