LD 1895
I'm in full support of LD 1895. I am supporting LD 1895. Please keep them out of 
LMA1, as this further endangers ocean sealife, which have already seen the effects in 
other areas, and places a severe detriment to the fishing industry, which has prided 
itself on being sustainable. Keeping the windmills, if we must have them, within 
LMA1 will not only kill off sealife, but it will destroy the Maine lobstering industry 
in a whole.
