LD 1895
I am a young person living in Presque Isle, and I write in support of 1895. Climate 
change is the most significant issue in the world right now. Our government must 
provide us with paths to make a clean energy transition that also protects ecosystems 
and workers. LD1895 understands that the future of our planet and the future of our 
people are the same thing; I urge its passage.
