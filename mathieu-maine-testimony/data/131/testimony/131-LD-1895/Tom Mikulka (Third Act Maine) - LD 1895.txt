Third Act Maine
LD 1895
Dear Chairpersons Senator Lawrence and  Representative Zeigler and esteemed 
members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee.  I am a resident of Cape
Elizabeth and am writing as co-facilitator of Third Act Maine,  a group of over 500 
elderly Mainers dedicated to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Third Act 
Maine fully supports LD 1895 and urges its passage as written. 
The recent statements of the IPCC and the IEA warned that continued development of
new fossil fuel projects will result in the breaching of the 1.5 C limit set by the Paris 
Accords on global warming. It is now likely that this will occur prior to 2030 because 
the fossil fuel industry is determined to burn every ounce of fossil fuel still in the 
ground. 
The development of offshore wind in Maine is thus essential for Maine and the planet.
Properly done with the safeguards contained in LD 1895, Maine will reduce itâ€™s 
dependence on fossil fuels and join other states in the transition to an alternative 
energy economy with the added bonus of many good union jobs. 
We at Third Act Maine ask for speedy approval of LD 1895 and its enactment into 
law. We need to stop burning fossil fuels for electrical energy now. 
Regards, 
Tom Mikulka, Ph.D.
