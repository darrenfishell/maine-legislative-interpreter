LD 1895
I am writing to express my strong support for LD 1985, which builds upon 
recommendations from Maine's Offshore Wind Roadmap.  This legislation to procure 
energy from offshore wind resources will strengthen Maine's economy by creating 
thousands of new high-quality jobs and stabilizing energy costs by reducing our 
reliance on imported gas and oil. It also sets high standards for wildlife, fisheries, and 
environmental monitoring, while also requiring important labor protections and 
providing benefits for Maine's most vulnerable communities.  The Gulf of Maine has 
some of the strongest and most consistent wind in the world, and we have an 
opportunity to develop this renewable energy resource in a responsible and equitable 
way. In fact, research from the University of Maine has shown that the Gulf of Maine 
has the potential to generate nearly 11% of the total off- shore wind power in the 
continental United States.
