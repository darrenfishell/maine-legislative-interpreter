ln Opposition of 
LD 1895 An Act Regarding the Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wind Resources 
May 18, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Committee on Energy, Utilities, 
and Technology, my name is Dustin Delano and I am the Chief Operating Officer for the New 
England Fishermen Stewardship Association (NEFSA) and also a commercial lobster fishermen 
of over 20 years NEFSA adamantly opposes LD 1895, An Act Regarding the Procurement of 
Energy from Offshore Wind Resources 
NEFSA IS an alliance of the wild han/esters of the waters off of New England, dedicated to 
educating the public about how best to manage our seafood resources through sound science 
and best practices at conservation used by ﬁshermen, with a view toward economic well- 
being, ecosystem sustainability and US food security 
The Gulf of Maine is home to thousands of coexisting marine spec|es, including endangered 
spec|es, who depend on it’s healthy ecosystem and unwavering environment for their very 
existence Beyond the effected marine species are many types of birds and bats, some of 
whom are also endangered species A recent quote from Dr Robert Barclay, a professor of 
biological sciences at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada said, 
“Wind energy IS booming in Alberta as else wear and bats and wind turbines 
don’t get along very well The wind turbines kill a lot of bats In fact in Alberta it kills
v 
more bats than it does birds” 
Dr Cori Lausen, director of bat conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society Canada said 
“ all they have to do is get close to these blades and that’s a low pressure zone and 
that literally causes the blood vessels in their lungs to explode Sort of like a scuba 
diver coming up too quickly”
A species in similar size to a bat is the Atlantic Puffin who have offshore nesting areas and are 
listed as having a vulnerable conservation status due to their decreasing population Much 
work, such as PI'Oj8Cl ’ Pufﬁn, has taken place over the last few decades to help restore this 
threatened species in- Maine 
A healthy Gulf of Maine is also crucial to Maine’s economy Maine’s fishing industry ranks high 
among the state and its lobster catch is the biggest in the country Commercial fishing IS the 
mainstay of coastal areas, mostly dominated by lobster fishing, though many ground fishermen 
still work the waters of the Gulf of Maine Offshore wind development has the VERY real 
potential forthe commercial and recreational fishing industry to be irrevocably harmed
l 
Floating offshore wind turbines will stand almost 900’ tall, nearly three times the height of the 
Statue of Liberty Each structure will encompass nearly one square mile of area when 
anchoring systems are factored in Three sets of chains, with individual links the size of pick 
up truck beds, will be anchored to moorings at a diagonal angle from the base ln 
presentations from developers, a 7 1 or as much as 9 1 scope will be necessary, causing the 
chains to sweep across the ocean floor, destroying all habitat within its path on every wind or 
tide change 
Because of the spacial impact, fishing will be impossible within wind farms Developers like to 
say fishing will remain open within the arrays, but the truth is, fishing within them will be 
extremely dangerous as hangups will be unavoidable Fish draggers will be unable to tow nets 
between turbines as they’l| risk catastrophic losses from hangups Lobstermen are required by 
federal law to fish a minimum of 25 traps on a trawl outside the twelve mile line in lobster 
management area 1 and a minimum of 45 traps on a trawl in lobster management area 3, 
making it impossible to lay a trawl amongst the arrays 
Another |'TlEl]Ol ’ issue lies with cable deployment When developers lay new cables, they use Jet 
ploughs to blow massive swaths of bottom out of the way to bury the cables Anything in the 
path of the Jet ploughs on the softer bottom will be completely destroyed Of course the cable 
can not be buried on hard bottom so that cable will lay across the ocean floor, leaving ocean 
life much more exposed to the electro-magnetic fields 
Currently, the State of Maine is working on a 12 turbine, floating research array to be deployed 
offshore While NEFSA is not a supporter of the research pl’O]6ClI, it is extremely important the 
State of Maine take full advantage of that specific arrays purpose and use it for its intended
I
I 
goal, RESEARCH L[i ) 1895 makes it law for hundreds of turbines to be deployed into the Gulf 
of |\/laine by 2030 and 2035, no matter the data obtained from the states research lease lt IS 
crucial that Maine does this right, as putting the cart before the horse will cause irreversible 
harm, detrimental to the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, the fishing industry, and the Maine 
economy
I 
For generations, fishermen have been true stewards to the ocean environment and are directly 
responsible for the current preservation of the Gulf of lvlaine as a result of their sustainability 
efforts Eveiy flSh6l'| ’T:18n I know has a major goal of presen/ing the fisheries and heritage for 
future generations, iuist like they were fortunate enough to inherit lndustrializing our oceans 
does not provide a future for the youth in Maine to have access Turning the Gulf of Maine into 
a “New York City,” does not allow for wild caught seafood to continue being provided to 
Americans amongst times of food insecurities 
As Mainers, you’ve liikely travelled through towns in the northern part of the state where the 
logging industry and paper mills once supported entire communities Areas once filled with 
growing families and hopeful and prosperous dreams, were slowly ripped away Now when 
you travel through, yfou see abandoned homes, decrepit buildings, and a real sense of struggle 
—forcing the youth tgo move away from areas where their families lived for generations Please, 
do not make decisiojns forcing our coastal communities into the same predicament The New 
England Fishermen _ Stewardship Association urges you to think responsibly before passing 
legislation which seeks to put the cart before the horse We urge you to not take erratic, swift 
action that will most: likely cause irrevocable harm to the Gulf of Maine We urge you to vote 
ought not to pass on LD 1895
