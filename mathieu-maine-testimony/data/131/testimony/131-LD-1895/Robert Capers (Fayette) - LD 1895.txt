LD 1895
I am writing as a constituent to express my strong support for LD 1985, which builds 
upon top recommendations from Maine's Offshore Wind Roadmap. The Gulf of 
Maine has some of the strongest and most consistent wind in the world, and we have 
an opportunity to develop this renewable energy resource in a responsible and 
equitable way. It is imperative that the state of Maine enact this legislation. It will 
help the United States move forward toward a carbon-free future -- something that we
must accomplish.  This legislation to procure energy from offshore wind resources 
also would strengthen Maine's economy by creating thousands of new high-quality 
jobs and stabilizing energy costs by reducing our reliance on imported gas and oil. It 
also sets high standards for wildlife, fisheries, and environmental monitoring, while 
also requiring important labor protections and providing benefits for Maine's most 
vulnerable communities.
