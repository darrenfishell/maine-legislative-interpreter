Testimony from Joseph Burg, in Support of L.D. 1895, "An Act Regarding 
the Procurement of Energy from Offshore Wind Resources” 
 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Energy, Utilities, and Technology, my name is Joseph Burg and I’m here today to speak 
in favor of L.D. 1895.  
 
 I'm an apprentice electrician and member of IBEW local 567. I've been a lifelong 
resident of Lewiston. I love Maine, and have no desire to leave this state. I intend to 
work, retire, and presumably die here. I hope this is possible. 
It's no secret that wages in Maine are not competitive, and this leads to workers in all 
vocations leaving to secure a brighter financial future. One that they feel Maine can not 
currently provide. While this legislation won't immediately solve this problem, it would 
create many skilled, good paying jobs that hard working, trained, and skilled Maine union 
laborers will stick around for. It is a step in the right direction.  
Along with wage disparity, climate change is one of the greatest issues we face today. 
And again, while not an immediate solution, offshore wind could prove to be an 
incredibly important part of the urgent need to curb climate change by moving further 
away from fossil fuels into clean renewables. 
L.D. 1895 is important for Mainers, the economy, and the environment. By ensuring 
union labor is used, you would ensure that this project is completed efficiently and safely,  
while also providing Maine citizens with the wages and benefits that they deserve, and 
the dignity that these afford us. Thank you. Please support LD 1895.
