DESCRIPTION TARIFF PERMITTING
UK•Name: Kincardine
•Total capacity: 50 MW
•Technology: floating•3.5 ROC (Renewable Obligation Certificate) 
currently equivalent to 190€/MWh•Government identified the best 
zones
•Developers to select an area 
within the identified zones Given the time pressure and tight deadlines 
imposed by the support mechanism:
•project design was not optimized for the site 
•technology choice was forced 
•Capabilities of the local supply chain were 
not explored and developed
Portugal•Name: WindFloat Atlantic
•Total capacity: 25 MW
•Technology: floating•Investment aid :
-APA (local government grant) = €6 million
-NER300 (European grant) = €13 million
•Operating aid :
-Initial top -up from APA for a total of €13 
million
-Feed -in-Tariff for 20 years:
▪First 10.5 MW weighted average tariff 
of 168€/MWh
▪After 10.5 MW tariff at 100€/MWh•Developer engaged in process 
to identify the best area
•Local socioeconomic and 
environmental issues were 
considered when selecting the 
project site•Time pressure on FID & COD imposed by the 
European Commission
•Expected lifecycle of 25 years with electricity 
market price exposure for only 5 years
•Front loaded remuneration scheme
•Investment aid helps developers to assume 
high CAPEX investment
•Loan from European Investment Bank for a 
total of €60 million
France•4 projects: 
-Groix et Belle -île(28.5 MW)
-EFGL (30 MW)

•Technology: floatingADEME funding:
•Investment aid
•Operating aid (feed -in-tariff), 240 Euros per 
MWh•Government identified the 
best zones after engagement 
with relevant stakeholder
•Developers to select an area 
within the identified zones •Government launched pilot development 
framework in 2015 defining the timeline
•Permitting of all 4 projects happened between 
2016 and 2018

CfD(Contract for Difference) Auction: Price + Merit Criteria
•Developer pre -qualification (through a series of quality criteria)
•The developers that bid the lowest tariff and have the highest total 
score (calculated according to specific merit criteria) winthe auction
•Grid connection award
•CfDaward for a defined period (usually between 20 and 25 years)•Fair competition: guaranteed thanks to the 
evaluation of the project in an objective and 
transparent manner (through merit criteria and 
price) 
•High visibility and clear structure: timelines, 
deadlines, locations, key authorities, auction, and 
framework structure are available for the 
development of the offshore wind industry for the 
whole decade
•De-risking by government: the government 
guarantees interconnection to the national grid, 
strongly de -risking all development activitiesRevenue Support Mechanisms: Case study : France’s government remuneration
