LD 1895
As a young person who moved to northern Maine in the last few years because I'm 
concerned about climate resiliency, I want Maine to be a leader in the green energy 
transition while prioritizing environmental justice and habitat conservation. LD 1895 
will help us get there. I strongly urge the committee to move this bill forward.
