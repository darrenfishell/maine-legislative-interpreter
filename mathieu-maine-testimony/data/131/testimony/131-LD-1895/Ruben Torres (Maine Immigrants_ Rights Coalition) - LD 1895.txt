(MIRC)
in

of

1895:
An

Regarding
the
Procurement

Of fshore

Resources.
MIRC

a

of
over
90
or ganizations
from

the

committed
to

and
defending
the

of
Maine’ s
immigrant
communities. 
W e
(T obin
W illiamson
and
Ruben
T orres)
are
MIRC’ s
Advocacy
&
Policy
team,
and
we 
support
L.D.
1895
for
the
following
reasons: 
1.
Responsible
development
and
economic
benefits
:
L.D.
1895
establishes
the 
Maine
Of fshore
W ind
Renewable
Ener gy
and
Economic
Development
Program
within
the 
Public
Utilities
Commission.
This
program
encourages
the
responsible
development
of 
renewable
of fshore
wind
power
projects
in
the
Gulf
of
Maine,
which
would
work
toward 
stabilizing
ener gy
prices,
reducing
reliance
on
imported
fossil
fuels,
and
generating
direct 
economic
benefits
for
the
people
of
Maine
by
creating
new
opportunities
for
sustainable
jobs 
that
provide
family-sustaining
wages
and
benefits
across
various
industries
and
populations. 
2.
Diversity ,
Equity ,
and
Inclusion
:
W e
are
particularly
encouraged
by
the
emphasis 
placed
on
diversity ,
equity ,
and
inclusion
within
L.D.
1895.
It
sets
high
standards
for 
environmental
justice
and
DEI
in
ener gy
procurement,
which
would
be
a
first
in
Maine;
these 
would
be
great
precedents
to
set
locally .
Moreover ,
this
bill
recognizes
the
importance
of 
equitably
distributed
economic
benefits
and
aims
to
promote
diversity
and
inclusion
in
the 
development
of
of fshore
wind
projects.
This
bill
takes
meaningful
steps
towards
rectifying 
historical
inequities
and
ensuring
that
all
communities
have
a
voice
and
share
in
the
benefits 
of
Maine's
renewable
ener gy
transition. 
3.
Local
hiring,
workfor ce
development,
and
safety
standards
:
L.D.
1895
sets 
forth
the
establishment
of
standards
for
local
hiring,
workforce
development,
and
safety 
within
the
of fshore
wind
industry .
By
doing
so,
the
bill
ensures
that
of fshore
wind
projects 
not
only
contribute
to
the
state's
economic
growth
but
also
provide
career
opportunities
and 
professional
development
for
Maine's
residents. 
4.
Envir onmental
pr otection
and
r esponsible
siting
:
L.D.
1895
supports
the 
responsible
siting
and
operation
of
of fshore
wind
power
projects,
focusing
on
avoiding, 
minimizing,
and
compensating
for
potential
ecological
disruptions.
This
commitment
to 
environmental
protection
demonstrates
a
thoughtful
approach
to
the
development
of
clean 
ener gy
resources,
ensuring
a
harmonious
coexistence
with
Maine's
rich
natural
ecosystems.
These
points
underscore
the
importance
of
L.D.
1895
in
advancing
renewable
ener gy , 
economic
prosperity ,
and
social
equity
in
Maine.
By
passing
this
bill,
you
can
make 
significant
strides
toward
a
sustainable
future
that
benefits
all
Maine
people;
therefore,
we 
ur ge
you
to
consider
the
tremendous
positive
impact
that
this
legislation
will
have
on
Maine's 
communities
and
the
entire
state.
Thank
you
for
your
attention
and
consideration.
