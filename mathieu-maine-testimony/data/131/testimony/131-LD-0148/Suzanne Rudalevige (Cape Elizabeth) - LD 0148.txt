Testimony for the 131th Session of the Maine State Legislature
Joint Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Public Hearing March 13  , 2023
LD  148.   Ought not to pass
Chairpersons Senator Anne Beebe- Center and Representative Suzanne Salisbury 
and members of the Committee, my name is Suzanne Rudalevige; I am retired  
after many years as an advocate for criminal justice reform and living in Cape 
Elizabeth.
 I am not in favor of adding new reasons for why juveniles may be detained 
(Juvenile simply means a child  suspected of committing a violation of the law.) A 
juvenile IS a child first.  My concern is that the result will be a growing population 
at  Long Creek,  even though the law requires detention to be the least restrictive 
setting.  Its all too easy to overestimate the risk.
  In Maine we are making a huge effort not to detain juveniles. We have made a 
lot of progress  with Juvenile Corrections officers working hard to keep children 
out of detention as much as possible.  
If the only reason a juvenile is to be detained is because he or she has no 
appropriate adult supervision,  would not Section 3203-A, part  1 A-1 be 
applicable? Isn’t a non-secure setting  what is appropriate here? Or is the problem 
here that this needs the juvenile’s permission? IS this a problem?
 So far as the second addition, to prevent a juvenile from committing  more 
violations, wouldn’t this apply to most kids who are arrested? 
 There are some homes which are not safe or healthy for children; but we know 
that working with families or close community to make changes through 
resources in education, addiction and other  health areas and economic stability 
around the child’s natural setting is the most successful way to spend our dollars, 
not through detention.
Thank you.
