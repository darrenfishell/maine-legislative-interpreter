LD 148
Dear Sir,
 
My name is Isteyaq Ahmed and I am a resident of India and currently based out at New Delhi,
I have been following this development virtually as my brother in law is serving a long time 
and is an Indian national. We have visited Maine twice to meet with our brother in law as per 
the visitation process of MSP. I must say that the people of Maine are lovely and inviting. 
 
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
 
I support this bill because this is a progressive step towards reforming and it paves the way 
for re-entry in the society in a systematic way.
 
Thank you so much for giving us a chance to speak on this matter in support of establishing 
parole.
 
Warm Regards
 
Isteyaq Ahmed
