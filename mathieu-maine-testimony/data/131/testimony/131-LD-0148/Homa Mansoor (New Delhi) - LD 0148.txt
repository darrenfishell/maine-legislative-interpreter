LD 148
Dear Sir,
 
My name is Dr.Homa Mansoor and I reside in New Delhi, India, and work with Medecins Sans
Frontiere in India . I have been following the developments regarding the re-establishment of 
parole in Maine with great interest. The issue is particularly important to me as I have an elder
brother and acquaintances who have been affected by the current lack of a parole system in 
Maine.
 
I fully support LD 178 and its efforts to re-establish a parole system in Maine. The 
re-establishment of parole would be a huge step forward in terms of criminal justice reform, 
providing a fairer and more equitable system for those who have been convicted of crimes.
Moreover, the establishment of a parole system would allow for the re-entry of individuals into
society in a more systematic and structured way. This would help to reduce recidivism rates 
and provide individuals with a better chance of successfully reintegrating into their 
communities.
 
I want to express my gratitude to the lawmakers and advocates who have been working 
tirelessly to bring about this important change. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to 
express my support for LD 178 and the re-establishment of parole in Maine.
 
Warm Regards
 
Dr Homa Mansoor
