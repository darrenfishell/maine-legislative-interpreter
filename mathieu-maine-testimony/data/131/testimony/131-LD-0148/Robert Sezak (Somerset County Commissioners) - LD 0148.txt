Support L. D. 148 An Act to Allow Detention of Juveniles for Certain Acts. 
Hello. My name is Robert Sezak. I am a resident of Fairfield and a Somerset County 
Commissioner representing Fairfield and N orridgewock. 
I am here before you today in support of L.D. 148 An Act to Allow Detention of 
juveniles for Certain Acts. 
This bill is important because it provides our local and county law enforcement agencies 
with needed tools to better ensure the safety of offending juveniles and that of the 
residents of the community where they live. 
This two way effort for safety and enforcement will help the juveniles by placing them 
in a custodial situation that keeps them from harm to themselves and to others. Some 
juveniles when released into the custody of their parent or guardian are summarily 
kicked out of the house even as the police officer is backing out of the driveway. Some 
parents or guardians are afraid of their children and are at wits end, unable to control 
their children or at times themselves. 
Parent involvement with their children is incredibly important but, unfortunately, is not 
always successful. This bill, while focused on detention and safety, is a tool to protect 
and serve the juveniles and adults of our communities. 
Please vote to pass L.D. 148 An Act to Allow Detention of Iuveniles for Certain Acts. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
Robert Sezak
