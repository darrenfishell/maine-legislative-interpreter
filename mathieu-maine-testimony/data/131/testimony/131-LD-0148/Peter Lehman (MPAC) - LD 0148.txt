Testimony in opposition to LD 1 48 
to the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety  
March 13, 2023  
Senator Beebee -Center , Representative Salisbury , and 
distinguished members of the Committee.  
My name is Peter Lehman and I live in Thomaston. I am a formerly 
incarcerated citizen and a person in long -term recovery. * I am 
testifying in opposition to LD 148 on beha lf of the Maine Prisoner 
Advocacy Coalition  whose goal is to promote restorative practices 
in order to increase public safety and the health of our community.   
We truly appreciate the good -hearted intentions behind this bill.  
 Unfortunately, the history of juvenile justice reform teaches us 
that it has been exactly these good -hearted intentions and open -
ended definitions of “care” and risk that have led to an over-
incarceration of racial and ethnic minorities and the creation of 
“Indian Schools.”   
In Main e, this has historically meant the over- incarceration of the 
Quebecois and tribal youth.  
We urge you to defeat LD 109.
