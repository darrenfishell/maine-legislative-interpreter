State of Maine 
131st Legislature 
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
Testimony of Charles F. Dingman 
Supporting 
LD 361, " An Act to Increase the Reimbursement for Electronic Consultations Through 
Medicaid" 
May 3, 2023 
Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and 
Human Services, I am Charlie Dingman I am a lawyer with the ﬁI’II1 of Kozak & Gayer , andI 
am here today on behalf of Covenant Healthcare, the parent organization serving St Joseph 
Healthcare in Bangor, St Mary’s in Lewiston, and various other health care providers in Maine 
Covenant has been actively involved in working with Senator Baldacci on this bill Thank you 
for the opportmnty to present testimony supporting its passage in an amended form, hopefully 
with the concurrence of the Department 
As you have already heard, this bill seeks to improve access to eConsults, an innovative 
solution to the difﬁculty for rural Mainers of obtaining timely, effective access to specialty 
health care when they need it As Senator Baldacci noted, Maine’s Department of Health and 
Human Services has Worked with St Joseph Healthcare and others to pioneer the deployment of 
eConsults to bring specialty services to patients who might otherwise not receive, or experience 
long delays in receiving, critically important access to specialists 
In addition to the beneﬁts noted in the sponsor’s testimony, St Joseph Healthcare would 
also note that eConsults provide an important tool to address disparities in access to care for 
those with social or ﬁnancial barriers that may prevent them from being able to take time off of 
Work and travel long distances to access a specialist, who will most likely be located in one of 
the more urban regions of our State In addition to improving patient care outcomes and access 
to specialty care, eConsults have also been proven to reduce the overall cost of healthcare, 
because they often make it possible for a patient to receive the care they need from their PCP 
without need for a specialty visit Delays in care due to lack of access to Sp6Clal1SlS ‘ often result 
in other costly healthcare utilization (e g , Emergency Room use for addressing untreated 
symptoms) Such utilization imposes signiﬁcant costs that can be avoided by improving timely 
access to specialty care through expansion of eConsults 
You have received a letter from MaineCare Director Michelle Probert, opposmg the bill, 
but I believe the Department Wlll agree that we had a very productive meeting Just yesterday to 
discuss their concerns about the bill and to begin a conversation about an amendment that might 
address those concems while carrying out Senator Baldacci ’s purpose in presenting the bill, 1e 
accelerating and sustaimng the use of eConsults to remedy health inequities especially affecting 
rural patients Attached to my testimony 1S a proposed amendment of the bill that seeks to

ach1eve th1s balance It recognlzes a key ob]ect1on expressed 1n Ms Probe1t’s letter by seeklng 
to conslder any Ma1neCare re1mbursement remedy 1n a manner conslstent wlth 22 M RS 
§3173-J, the rate reform law descrlbed 1n her letter It also addresses another key factor

also a key factor 
Sandy Nesm, VP of Operat1ons for St Joseph Healthcare and also COO of Commumty 
Care Partnershlp of Mame, a network of pnmary care provlders 1nclud1ng St Joseph and many 
communlty health centers across the State, has been a pnmary proponent of th1s b1ll and has

The Case for Adequate Reimbursement for eConsults in Maine 
Executive Summary 
There IS a significant disparity in access to specialty care for underserved patients in Maine, particularly for those 
residing in the most rural areas of our State This disparity is costing the State millions of dollars due to delays in 
diagnosis, untreated chronic illness, and resulting increased emergency room use and hospitalization Limited in 
inequitable access to specialty care is also a source ofsubstantial frustration for both primary care providers and 
their patients Maine's rural-dwelling population face even significant challenges to access due to the extremely 
limited supply of specialists in rural parts of the state This briefing outlines an evidence based, high value and low 
risk solution that has been thoroughly studied and piloted in Maine and has been implemented in many other states 
The Need 
Medicaid patients frequently present to community hospitals, community health centers ("CHCs") or federally 
qualified health centers (”FQHCs") and other safety net practices with highly complex medical concerns It IS well 
established that these patients have higher rates of complex chronic illness and overall poorer health status 
Published data supports the observation that there IS a substantial unmet need for specialist care across the nation 
A 2007 study of CHCs found that 25%, or one in four visits, resulted in a referral for specialty medical services that 
were not provided by the community health center A more recent study in the "American Journal of Managed Care" 
found that 60% of CHCs surveyed reported significant difficulty obtaining new specialty care visits for their Medicaid 
patients 
Such limited access to specialty care creates a costly disparity for the most underserved patients within our state 
This briefing paper recommends a proven solution to this disparity, a solution that will reduce significant wasted 
medical expenditures, and improve health outcomes for vulnerable populations 
eConsult Background and History 
eConsults are digital exchanges of clinical information between primary care and specialty care providers that assist 
in coordinating patient care These asynchronous exchanges are relatively low coast and easy to implement at scale 
Previous studies have demonstrated that their routine use improves outcomes, reduces wait times, and eliminates 
unnecessary referrals Between 2012 and 2016 researchers and clinicians from Community Health Center, Inc (CHCI) 
in Middletown, CT and its Weitzman Institute, in partnership with the University of Connecticut and Connecticut's 
Department of Social Services (DSS), conducted a randomized, controlled trial showing the impact of eConsults on 
access, timeliness, quality and cost of care compared to traditional face-to-face referrals for patients with Medicaid 
Results demonstrated that 69% of the eConsult referrals were resolved without the need for a face-to-face VISIT1 
After SIX months of follow-up, the overall per-patient cost to Medicaid in the eConsults group was $480 per patient 
lower than in the face-to-face groupz Additional economic analyses of eConsults, also conducted by the Weitzman 
Institute partnering with DSS, were published in Health Affairs? ’ demonstrating an $81 per member per month savings 
for Medicaid when eConsults were used for iust four common specialties These results demonstrated conclusively 
that eConsults provided significant savings to the State's Medicaid program while improving access to specialty care 
for its patients

Subsequent to these studies, Weitzman researchers obtained a grant that allowed the expansion of the eConsult 
program to Maine through a collaboration with Penobscot Community Health Center (PCHC), the FQHC serving the 
greater Bangor area and a community partner to St Joseph Healthcare Between 2015 and 2020 PCHC was able to 
complete 921 eConsults in 8 common specialties More than 90% of these consults prevented what otherwise would 
have been a face-to-face visit, saving patients time, travel, and money and improving the capability of the health 
center to provide effective care Loss of grant funding resulted in a several-year hiatus at PCHC when no eConsults 
were available The newly launched Maine eConsult Network, supported by grant funding from the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC), IS bringing the sen/ices to St Joseph Healthcare, and back to PCHC as well, along with offering 
the service to seven additional health centers across the state However, a long-term, sustainable solution not 
dependent on grants IS needed in order for all MaineCare patients to have access to this important service While 
MaineCare has authorized reimbursement of eConsults, the nominal per consult rate has not been sufficient to 
cover the costs of the services, resulting in limited to no uptake in the state eConsults require technology to enable 
the secure transmission of information between providers and requires time and effort from specialists to review 
clinical information and provide a detailed response Medicaid Programs in other states reimburse at substantially 
higher rates. 
In 2020, the Millbank Memorial Fund published findings on the effectiveness of eConsults, based upon the Medicaid 
Evidence-based Decisions (MED) PI'0jECt, a research collaboration of 22 state Medicaid programs This report, 
Electronic Consultations (eConsults) ATRIPLE WIN FOR PATIENTS, CLINICIANS, AND PAYERS, concluded 
0 ”There is a strong indication that the use of eConsults can increase access to, and make more efficient use of, 
specialty care without sacrificing patient or clinician satisfaction or increasing total costs of care Moreover, initial 
reports suggest that the use of eConsults can actually lower total cost of care and can support better 
communication and relationships between primary care and specialty care clinicians" 
Q ”The use of eConsults holds promise for delivering health care services that are more pa tient-centered, 
reducing the need for face~to-face specialist visits and unnecessary testing and procedures, and reducing 
patients ’ costs by minimizing travel time and costs, child care needs, and time off work" 
6 ”From a coverage perspective, the use of eConsults provides one solution to address access of care issues and 
reduce health care system inefficiencies and cost" 
There remains no doubt that MaineCare and its members could realize substantial benefits from the use of 
eConsults These benefits are easily achievable by providing reasonable reimbursement coverage for these consults, 
in a manner similar to what has been done by several other state Medicaid Programs This IS an evidence-based, high 
value and low-risk solution that has been thoroughly studied and vetted The data supporting eConsults IS 
conclusive, and the case for Maine to increase reimbursement could not be clearer
