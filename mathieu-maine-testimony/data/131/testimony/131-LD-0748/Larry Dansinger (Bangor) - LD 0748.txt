LD 748
To members of the Judiciary Committee:
I write in support of LD 748. Besides being blind, justice holds scales that are 
balanced approximately equally, meaning that justice requires approximately equal 
rights for both defense and prosecution. In our courts today, that balance is not close 
enough to equal. LD 748 will help to create a more equal balance, and more justice, 
by providing defendants certain rights they should have.
