 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly in support of  
 LD 748, An Act to Strengthen the Due Process Rights of Persons in Law 
 Enforcement Custody 
 Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary  
 Good   morning   Senator   Carney ,  Representative   Moonen   and  distinguished   members   of  the 
 Committee   on  Judiciary .  My  name   is  Morgan  Rielly ,  and  I  represent   House   District   127,  which  
 includes   part  of  Westbrook.   Please   accept   this  testimony   in  support   of  LD  748,  An  Act  to 
 Strengthen the Due Pr ocess Rights of Persons in Law Enfor cement Custody . 
 The  Supreme   Court   in  Vega  V.  Tekoh   transformed   a  Reconstruction-era   law  that  is  meant   to 
 protect   the  rights   of  freed   slaves   and  marginalized   Americans   along   with  providing   redress  
 against   state-sanctioned   corruption   and  violence.   LD  748  will  amend   the  Declration   of  Rights   in 
 the  Constitutition   of  Maine   to  explicitly   establish   that  people   have   a  fundamental   right   to  be 
 notified   of  their  rights   pursuant   to  Article   I,  Section   6  in  order   to  further   protect   the  civil  rights   of 
 all  individuals.   This  will  ensure,   despite   the  Supreme   Court   ruling   in  Vega  V.  Tekoh   ,  that  anyone  
 who  is  placed   under   arrest,   in  custordy   or  under   interrogation   or  temporarily   detained   by  law 
 enforcement   must   be  provided   with  information   of  the  person's   privilege   against  
 self-incrimination and the person's right to the assistance of legal counsel.  
 While   I  am  unable   to  join  you  in-person   during   this  public   hearing,   I  am  happy   to  address   any 
 questions sent to me regarding   LD 748   . 
 Thank you for your consideration.  
 District 127: Part of Westbrook
