“An Act to Strengthen the Due Process Rights of Persons in Law Enforcement Custody”

Testimony in Opposition of LD 748. 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint. Standing Committee on 
Judiciary. My name is Shira Bums and I represent the Maine Prosecutors Association. I am here to 
testify in opposition of LD 748. 
This bill expands when Miranda] warnings would need to be given that are not required under 
current law and adds two new forms of de facto arrest: “under interrogation ” and “temporary 
detention. ” Miranda is given when there is custodial interrogation, meaning you need both custody 
and interrogation. However, this bill would require Miranda if either of the situations arise, not 
both. Further, the expansion would have many collateral consequences, including citizens not 
wanting the warning when they are temporarily detained during a trafﬁc stop. This would instill 
fear in an everyday citizen that is not coming into our criminal justice system and does not need to 
know about a person’s right to the assistance of legal counsel in a criminal matter. 
Ofﬁcers respond to thousands of emergency calls each year in Maine, many domestic violence in 
nature. The response to those calls include separating the parties on the scene and asking each party 
what happened. Even though no one is in custody at that time, because the ofﬁcer is asking them 
what happened it would be considered an “interrogation. ” The ofﬁcers would then need to give both 
parties, the victim and the defendant, Miranda warnings which would have-a chilling effect on 
victims calling for emergency services. _ 
Furthermore, the exclusionary rule, a law that prohibits the use of illegally obtained evidence ina 
criminal trial, is a very good checks and balance system to make sure law enforcement is following 
proper procedure and giving “Miranda” warnings when applicable.'

For these reasons, the Maine , Prosecutors Association is in opposition of LD 748-.
