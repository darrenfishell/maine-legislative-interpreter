Testimony
in
Opposition
to

“An
Act
to
Amend
the
Maine
Exclusion
Amount
in
the
Estate
Tax,”
and

New

Levels”
Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1338
and
LD
1866
.
After
two-plus
years
of
record
inflation,
the
last
thing
Mainers
need
are
higher
taxes.
These
bills
would
force
Mainers
to
fork
over
even
more
of
their
hard-earned
income,
either
directly
from
their
paychecks,
or
upon
their
death.
These
two
forms
of
taxation,
on
income
and
death,
may
constitute
the
least
moral
forms
of
taxation
our
society
has
invented.
Income
taxes
are
different
from
any
other
tax.
When
the
state
taxes
your
income,
it
steals
the
direct
fruits
of
your
labor;
it
steals
your
time.
And,
Maine
taxes
income
earned
up
to
$100,000
more
than
any
other
state
in
New
England.
It's
time
to
turn
this
ship
around
and
begin
to
attract
more
middle-income
and
working-class
people
to
live
and
build
their
futures
here.
LD
1866
would
move
our
state
in
the
opposite
direction,
and
fast.
Taxes
should
only
be
levied
on
the
same
dollar
once,
if
at
all.
It
is
not
right
for
the
government
to
tax
your
earnings
before
you
even
see
them,
then
also
tax
you
when
you
spend
those
earnings.
Of
course,
it
doesn’t
end
there.
The
state
also
taxes
your
property
after
you’ve
bought
it,
simply
for
owning
it
for
another
year,
and
the
state
taxes
whatever
you
have
left
when
you
die.
Our
tax
structure
is
far
from
fair.
LD
1338
would
significantly
contribute
to
Maine's
already
oppressive
overall
tax
burden,
currently
the
third-highest
in
the
nation
1
It
would
lower
the
estate
tax
exclusion
amount
from
$5.6
million
to
$2
million
and
provide
for
additional
exclusions
for
property
used
in
agriculture,
aquaculture,
and
wood
processing,
plus
a
$3.8
million
exclusion
amount
for
machinery
and
farmland
inherited
by
family
members
who
maintain
use
as
farmland
for
at
least
5
years.

The
bending-over-backwards
by
sponsors,
session-after-session,
to
carve
this
bill
around
the
very
real
concern
of
folks
who
may
have
to
sell
a
family
farm
to
pay
the
death
tax,
shows
the
absurdity
of
this
entire
exercise.
The
death
tax
is
simply
not
fair.
It
is
double
(or
triple)
taxation.
Maine
is
one
of
only
12
states
(plus
D.C.)
which
levies
any
tax
on
wealth
held
at
death.
2
Among
those,
Maine
has
a
relatively
high
exclusion
rate
currently.
This
creates
a
discrepancy
where
elderly
Americans
are
more
likely
to
relocate
before
death
in
order
to
save
their
family
from
unwanted
confiscation
of
inheritance
from
the
government.
Tax
flight
is
a
real
thing.
A
2015
report
by
The
Heritage
Foundation
noted
that
individuals
whose
estates
are
likely
going
to
be
“partially
confiscated”
at
death
are
moving
to
other
states
to
avoid
the
burden.
3
The
states
which
saw
the
greatest
in-migration
during
and
after
the
pandemic
were
the
lowest-taxed
states,
whereas,
the
states
which
lost
population
(New
York,
California,
Illinois),
are
among
the
highest-taxed.
4
This
is
not
a
coincidence.
If
a
decedent
owns
land
such
as
a
family
farm
and
cannot
relocate
before
passing,
they
are
subject
to
the
whims
of
politicians
greedy
to
take
more
of
their
citizens’
wealth.
They
could
preemptively
sell
their
property
to
liquidate
it
and
make
it
easier
to
move
out-of-state,
but
oftentimes
only
the
rich
have
the
financial
wherewithal
to
accomplish
this
tax
haven
do-si-do.
The
last
thing
Mainers
need
is
higher
taxes.
Please
deem
LD
1338
and
LD
1866
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
continue
to
reject
these
out-of-touch
attempts
by
politicians
to
take
more
of
Mainers’
hard-earned
money.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
