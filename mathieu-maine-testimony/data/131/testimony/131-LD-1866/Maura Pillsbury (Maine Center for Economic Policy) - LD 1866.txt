Surcharge for HIgher Income Levels 
May 77, 2023 
Senator Grohoskl, Representatlve Perry, and members of the Ta><atIon Commlttee, my name Is 
l\/laura Plllsbury and lam an analyst at the MaIne Center for EconomIc Pollcy I am here today 
to testIfy In quallﬁed support oI‘LD1866 Th|s bIll wIll cut taxes for mlddle Income l\/laIners 
whIle raIsIng taxes on the top 5 percent of l\/|aIne earners 
Flrst let me convey that we appreclate Rep CollIngs submIttIng thIs bIll and the Issues wIth our 
Income tax structure It attempts to address l\/lECEP supports makIng our Income tax code 
more progressIve by IncreasIng taxes on those wIth a greater means to pay, to contrIbute to 
the thIngs we all beneﬁt from that make l\/laIne a great place to lIve 
Th|s bIll would make l\/laIne ’s Income tax code more progresslve by 
o LowerIng the bottom bracket from 5 8 percent to 4 5 percent 
0 Creatmg a new hIghest bracket of 8 75 percent for Income $250,000+ ($500,000+ for 
marrled couples) 
o Creatmg a surcharge oI‘3 percent on Income over $1 m ($2m for marrled couples) and 
6 percent on Income over $1 Om ($2Om for marrled couples) 
We belIeve there IS an error In the bIll that needs to be corrected, regardIng the surcharge 
language, whIch IS why our support Is quallﬁed If Implemented as wrItten, we belIeve It would 
have a dII°ferent Impact than the sponsor Intended 
As we have prevlously testlﬁed, accordIng to Instltute on Taxatlon and EconomIc PolIcy 
modelIng, lowerlng the bottom bracket from 5 8 percent to 4 5 percent would cost an 
estImated $180 mIllIon per year, wIth the largest beneﬁts golng to l\/laIne tax ﬁlers earnIng over 
$150,000 per year because of l\/laIne ’s large standard deductIon and personal exemptlon We 
oppose thIs as a stand-alone measure However, If the cost ofthIs change Is made revenue 
neutral by creatIng a new hIghest bracket and mIllIonaIre surcharge, we belleve the bIll asa 
whole wIll make l\/laIne ’s tax code more progressIve by Increasmg taxes on hIgh earners and 
lowerIng taxes on l\/lalners wIth mIddle Income 
We urge the Commlttee to also consIder how the state can make the ta>< code more 
progressIve for the lowest earners by Increasmg the chIld tax credIt, sales tax faIrness credIt, 
and/or earned Income tax credlt Please do not leave these l\AaIners and theIr famIlIes behInd 
Thank you for your tlme and I would be happy to answer any questIons
