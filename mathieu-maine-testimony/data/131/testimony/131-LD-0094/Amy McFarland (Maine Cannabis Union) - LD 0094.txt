Good Day Ladies and Gentlemen of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee. 
My name is Amy McFarland. l am a patient, a medical cannabis farmer and the President of 
Maine Cannabis Union. 
l am here today to testify against LD#94, “An Act Regarding the Use of Medical Cannabis by 
Minors." 
Requiring a parent to obtain approval from their minor child’s primary care provider is an 
unnecessary burden. 
What happens if that primary care provider is against medical cannabis use in minors? 
If that were to occur, the parent would then be forced to look for a new primary care provider. 
This in turn could delay the minor from receiving proper medical treatment in a timely manner. 
In addition, many of the children that use medical cannabis are vaccine injured. 
Finding a primary care provider who is familiar with both medical cannabis use and vaccine 
injuries is very rare in the state. 
Now, I would like to comment on the additional pages added last minute to this bill. 
Excluding cannabis concentrate as a form of medical cannabis is quite absurd. Cannabis 
concentrate is nothing more than cannabis in a concentrated form. 
Next, changing the deﬁnition of “Qualifying Patient” to the proposed deﬁnition would deny out of 
state patients. 
Lastly, removing a medical provider's autonomy and going back to a limited list of qualifying, 
conditions would be taking many steps backward in the program. 
With that said, l ask you all today to vote “Ought Not to Pass" on LD#94. 
Thank you for your time, 
Amy McFarland 
President, Maine Cannabis Union
