I OPPOSE the legislation to outlaw cannabis concentrates in the medical program, 
jeopardizing patient privacy and delay treatment by making the government in charge 
of issuing certification cards and therefore having a list of all medical cannabis 
patients along with removal of a medical providers' autonomy and bring back a 
limited list of conditions that qualify for certification and prohibit physician assistants
from providing certifications
