LD 94
I am writing today in opposition to LD94 .
Many Maine patients use concentrates for essential high dosing, as well as cost 
saving.
The program in place works well in protecting patients as is. 
this will cause many patients to have to choose between getting treatment legally or 
going against the law.
The state has worked hard to create one of the best programs in the country. doing this
will hurt it greatly. 
I encourage you to vote against this. 
Thank you for your time.
