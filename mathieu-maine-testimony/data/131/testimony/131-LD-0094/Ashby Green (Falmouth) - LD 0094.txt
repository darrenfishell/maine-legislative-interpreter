Many Maine patients use concentrates for essential high dose treatments. The system 
of the medical provider issuing certification cards works well and protects patient 
privacy â€“ the government should not have a list of cannabis patients. Medical 
providers can decide if the potential benefits of medical cannabis use outweigh the 
potential risks for any patient condition. The proposed language would prevent the 
use of cannabis for common conditions like insomnia, generalized anxiety, end of life 
symptoms, rare neurological conditions and much more.
Physician Assistants (as well as naturopathic physicains) are qualified to determine if 
treatment with medical cannabis is indicated.
