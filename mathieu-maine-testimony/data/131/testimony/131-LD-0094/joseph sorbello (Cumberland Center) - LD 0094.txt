Good
morning
V eterans
and
Legal
Af fairs
Committee,
I
am
writing
today
in
regards
to
the
proposed
LD
94,
specifically
to
discourage
the
rescinding
of
the
prescribing
rights
for
Physician
Assistants.
I
have
been
a
P A
in
the
great
State
of
Maine
for
30
years,
starting
my
career
with
the
Cardio-Thoracic
surgeons
in
Portland
as
well
ay
many
Emergency
Departments,
Express
Care
clinics
and
primary
care
of fices
throughout
the
State.
With
my
prescribing
rights
I
have
participated
in
a
vast
array
of
care
including
acute
psychiatric
care,
pain
management
and
recovery ,
and
extensive
primary
and
emergency
care
with
a
consistent
record
of
safety
and
patient
advocacy .
Since
the
passing
of
LD
1539
5
years
ago
I
have
been
running
my
business,
Medical
Marijuana
Practitioners,
providing
Medical
Marijuana
Certifications
and
education
primarily
in
Southern
and
Central
Maine.
In
that
time
I
have
worked
hard
to
provide
compassionate
and
educated
service
to
my
patients,
which
include
V eterans,
with
a
great
record
of
patient
satisfaction
and
safety .
I
am
nationally
certified
by
the
National
Commission
of
Certifying
Physician
Assistants
(NCCP A)
and
have
worked
very
hard
to
keep
my
certification
active.
Physician
Assistants
are
required
to
take
comprehensive
and
very
dif ficult
exam
provided
by
NCCP A
every
7
years
as
well
as
150
hours
of
continuing
medical
education
annually .
Our
profession
is
held
to
very
high
standards
and
I
do
not
see
a
reason
why
we
should
be
excluded
from
Medical
Marijuana
Certifications.
Physician
Assistants
and
Nurse
Practitioners
are
used
interchangeably
in
all
medical
practices
in
the
State
and
I
see
no
reason
why
we
should
be
excluded
from
the
Medical
Marijuana
program.
Therefore
I
urge
the
Committee
not
to
support
LD
94.

Good morning Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee,
I am writing today in regards to the proposed LD 94,  specifically to discourage the 
rescinding of the prescribing rights for Physician Assistants.  I have been a PA in the 
great State of Maine for 30 years, starting my career with the Cardio-Thoracic 
surgeons in Portland as well ay many Emergency Departments, Express Care clinics 
and primary care offices throughout the State.  With my prescribing rights I have 
participated in a vast array of care including acute psychiatric care,  pain management
and recovery, and extensive primary and emergency care with a consistent record of 
safety and patient advocacy. 
Since the passing of LD 1539 5 years ago I have been running my business, Medical 
Marijuana Practitioners, providing Medical Marijuana Certifications and education 
primarily in Southern and Central Maine.   In that time I have worked hard to provide 
compassionate and educated service to my patients, which include Veterans, with a 
great record of patient satisfaction and safety. 
 I am nationally certified by the National Commission of Certifying Physician 
Assistants (NCCPA) and have worked very hard to keep my certification active.  
Physician Assistants are required to take comprehensive and very difficult exam 
provided by NCCPA every 7 years as well as 150 hours of continuing medical 
education annually.   Our profession is held to very high standards and I do not see a 
reason why we should be excluded from Medical Marijuana Certifications.   
Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners are used interchangeably in all medical 
practices in the State and I see no reason why we should be excluded from the 
Medical Marijuana program. 
Therefore I urge the Committee not to support LD 94. 
Sincerely 
Joseph Sorbello PA-C
