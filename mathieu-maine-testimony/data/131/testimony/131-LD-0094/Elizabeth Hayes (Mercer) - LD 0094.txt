Elizabeth Hayes
Mercer
LD 94
To the members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, my name is Elizabeth 
Hayes, a resident of Mercer, and medical cannabis patient and caregiver. I am 
submitting testimony to voice my opposition to LD94, An act Regarding the Use of 
Medical Cannabis by Minors.
In regard to the bill as it was initially written: I wanted to ensure the committee is 
made aware of the fact that due to the federal status of cannabis, many primary care 
doctors are prohibited from issuing medical certifications to their patients, even if 
they feel their patient would benefit from cannabis, and that it would be a safer 
treatment than pharmaceutical alternatives. When I discussed cannabis with my 
primary care provider, my doctor told me that while he did believe that cannabis was 
an appropriate treatment for my condition the hospital that he worked for had 
prohibited him from issuing patient certifications. He said hospital administrators 
were concerned it would jeopardize the federal funding that they received. I am 
concerned that the sponsor of this bill may not understand or appreciate how this 
would create barriers to parents looking for solutions for a child with a serious 
medical condition.  
Regarding the proposed amendment: These proposed changes to the medical program 
are absolutely over the top. Specifically excluding cannabis concentrated from the 
definition of medical cannabis shows a lack of knowledge of how patients use 
cannabis to treat life threatening conditions.
Thank you for considering my testimony. I ask that you vote ought not to pass on 
LD94.
