LD 94
I am someone that struggles with insomnia and anxiety and yes I was extremely 
effected from knee pain after multiple surgeries.  I was trialed on many different 
medications for sleeping issues and anxiety and could not tolerate the side effects.  I 
am able to work full time and go to college with the use of cannibus for the above 
reason.  Please do not remove the medical providers role or these medical conditions 
from the current law.
