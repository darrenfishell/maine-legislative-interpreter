Passage of this legislation will harm children like my son Calvin who have medically 
refractory epilepsy, and other chronic conditions and disorders, and who rely on 
medical cannabis to help reduce, control and stop seizures and the suffering and 
damage that seizures cause.
After the failure of nine, powerful anticonvulsant pharmaceuticals, my homemade, 
non-psychoactive, THCA cannabis oil was a game changer for my son Calvin. Calvin 
was suffering weekly, conscious-onset grand mal seizures, often while in the bathtub. 
After reaching a therapeutic dose of my homemade, non psychoactive THCA 
cannabis oil, Calvin went over 500 days without any daytime grand mal seizures. For 
nearly ten years the cannabis oil has helped to control Calvin's seizures during a 
protracted and difficult wean from the dangerous and harmful effects of 
benzodiazepines. Cannabis oil has consistently helped control Calvin's seizure 
clusters, and has thus helped us avoid taking him to the hospital for status epilepticus. 
If this bill is passed, it could make it impossible for children like my son Calvin, who 
suffer the effects of refractory epilepsy, to access a safe, alternative therapy, which in 
many cases has very literally saved their lives (for example, Charlotte Fiji of 
Charlotte's Web fame.)
Please do not pass this legislation.
