I operate a legal Medical Storefront in central Maine. This week, I currently have 4 
patients who are using high doses of RSO concentrate to treat symptoms from 
debilitating disease. Changing the definition of medical Cannabis and removing 
concentrate would severely limit their access to legal safe medicine leaving the black 
market as the only option. The high doses need are unavailable through the 
recreational market.
The proposed issuing of a Medical card would also limit access to medical cannabis 
for many people, Jeopardize patient privacy, delay treatment by making the 
government in charge of issuing certification cards and therefore having a list of all 
medical cannabis patients. The state program is overworked and understaffed as it is, 
you would be adding a tremendous burden on the state to administer the new rules. 
The proposed changes would remove a medical providers' autonomy and bring back a
limited list of conditions that qualify for certification. This was previously dealt with 
when it was decided to remove the list of conditions, leaving it up to a medical 
professional to decide if Cannabis would benefit the patient. It would prohibit 
physician assistants from providing certifications, again limiting access to patients in 
need.
The majority of these proposed rule changes are unnecessary, redundant and would 
only succeed in hurting both the medical program we have worked so hard to build 
and the Maine citizens who rely on us for safe affordable medicine and who would be
struggling to find another source. Most likely the black market that is unregulated, 
un-taxed and unsafe.
