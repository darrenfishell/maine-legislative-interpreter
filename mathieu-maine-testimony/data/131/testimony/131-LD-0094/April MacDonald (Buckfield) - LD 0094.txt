I have been a cancer patient since 2015 using concentrated oil.  The oil is provided to 
me in suppositories.  Without the use of these suppositories I have a choice, to die!  
Die from cancer or die from conventional treatments.  Please leave the medical 
program here in Maine alone!!  Do not do this will only take away the freedom and 
alternatives for cancer, seizure and chronic pain patients.  Everyone should have a 
choice besides BIG pharma pills!!
