Good morning,
As a small business owner and a caregiver/medical grower who relies very strongly 
upon out of state patients for my business, I request that the legislature consider the 
ramifications of this bill, specifically the section which suggests that a caregiver must 
be "in state". Patients travel from all over the east coast and the US to Maine for the 
high quality medical cannabis which is grown here, and I am concerned that not only 
will Maine's medical program and operators suffer, but as will all of the people who 
no longer have access to their medicine if such a provision is accepted.  
Additionally, regarding section 5's proposed limitation on medical providers who may
prescribe medical cannabis to patients. I fear this limitation is intended to reduce, or 
shrink the number of medical certifications which are granted (a number which I 
believe is already low, due in part to the narrow list of qualifying conditions which 
are accepted). I believe this would directly harm patients by potentially limiting their 
access and by extension will harm Maine's medical program, a program which I 
firmly believe is the finest cannabis regulatory model in the country. 
Thank you for your consideration,
John W.
