Hello.  I am against the passage of this bill.  Many Maine patients use concentrates for
essential high-dose treatments especially in cases of severe pain and cancer.  Would 
you prefer we put kids on oxycontin for sever pain.  It seems to me that most pain 
meds run far greater risks than cannabis for pain or nausea.
I have been a Maine Medical Marijuana patient for 8 years and have found the system
of the medical provider issuing certification cards works well and protects patient 
privacy - the government shouldn't have a list of cannabis patients.  Are there lists of 
patients for any other medical treatments?
Medical providers can decide if the potential benefits of medical cannabis use 
outweigh the potential risks for any patient condition. The proposed language would 
prevent the use of cannabis for common conditions like insomnia, generalized 
anxiety, end-of-life symptoms, rare neurological conditions, and much more.
Physician assistants (as well as naturopathic physicians) are qualified to determine if 
treatment with medical cannabis is indicated.
This bill will cause thousands of patients to have to choose between breaking the law 
and risking legal consequences for a victimless crime or going without their medical 
treatment.
