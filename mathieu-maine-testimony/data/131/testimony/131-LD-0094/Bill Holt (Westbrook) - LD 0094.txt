I know of many Maine patients who use concentrates for essential high-dose 
treatments
The system of the medical provider issuing certification cards works well and protects
patient privacy - the government shouldn't have a list of cannabis patients.
Medical providers can decide if the potential benefits of medical cannabis use 
outweigh the potential risks for any patient condition. The proposed language would 
prevent the use of cannabis for common conditions like insomnia, generalized 
anxiety, end-of-life symptoms, rare neurological conditions, and much more.
Physician assistants (as well as naturopathic physicians) are qualified to determine if 
treatment with medical cannabis is indicated.
This bill will cause thousands of patients to have to choose between breaking the law 
and risking legal consequences for a victimless crime or going without their medical 
treatment.
