Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs In Opposition of LD 94 An Act Regarding the Use of Medical CannabisJanelle LaPlante Portland, ME March 29, 2022Senator Hickman and members of the Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs: My name is Janelle LaPlante. I am a resident of Portland, Maine. I am a registered cannabis caregiver assistant. My husband and I operate a small caregiver cultivation facility as well as extraction and product manufacturing facility in Portland, Maine. I am also a member of the Maine Craft Cannabis Association, a group committed to preserving Maine’s craft cannabis industry. I am testifying today in opposition of LD 94: An Act Regarding the Use of Medical Cannabis. This act is a massive step backwards for Maine’s medical cannabis program.•It would cause thousands of patients to have to choose between breaking the law and risking legal consequences for a victimless crime or go without their medical treatment. •It prohibits cannabis concentrate but allows for edible products and tinctures. Most edible products and tinctures are made with cannabis concentrate, so this is contradictory.•Many patients use concentrates for essential high-dose treatment. Believe it or not, there are patients who need 900+mg THC for effective relief. This bill would make such unobtainable to patients.•Medical providers issue medical cards and are more than competent to decide if the potential beneﬁts of medical cannabis outweighs the potential risks for any patient condition. The proposed language would prevent the use of cannabis for common conditions such as insomnia, anxiety, end of life symptoms, rare neurological conditions and much more. We’ve worked hard to create one of the best medical cannabis programs in the country. For these reasons, among many others, I ask the committee to vote no in opposition to this bill.Thank you for your time.
