As a medical marijuana patient since 2014 I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. I have 
numerous medical issues and have used THC in liquid and topical forms to relieve a 
number of ailments I've suffered with for many years. I enjoy a private relationship 
with my medical provider and my personal caregiver that shopping through 
recreational channels does not support - the stores have young people working in 
them that don't understand a medical patient's needs or dosages, and the stores support
a very different clientele that an older medical patient (and there are many of us in 
Maine) cannot relate to. I've worked with my caregiver for many years, they know me
personally.   The system of the medical provider issuing certification cards works well
and protects my privacy â€“ the government should not have a list of cannabis patients 
just as much as the government should have no knowledge of any of my other health 
issues - a person's health should not be regulated. Medical providers can decide if the 
benefits of medical cannabis use outweigh potential risks for patient ailments - a 20 
something person with no medical experience in a recreational cannabis store cannot 
and should not be selling to the medical community. Physician Assistants and 
naturapaths are qualified to determine if treatment with medical cannabis is indicated 
- all medical patients in Maine benefit from having qualified people help with dosing 
and selection of cannabis products to treat the many ailments that can be helped by 
the use of cannabis. Do not take our right to have private medical treatment with the 
use of cannabis in Maine. We have a great medical program in Maine, supporting the 
high number of older residents who require more privacy and medical advisement 
support than recreational stores and delivery services and ever provide. We need to 
keep it in place.
