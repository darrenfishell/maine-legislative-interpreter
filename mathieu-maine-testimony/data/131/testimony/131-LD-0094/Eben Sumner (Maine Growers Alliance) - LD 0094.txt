LD 94
Dear Senator Hickman, Rep. Supica, and the distinguished members of the 131st joint
standing committee of Veterans and Legal Affairs. My name is Eben Sumner, I am a 
resident of West Baldwin, Maine. I am a founding member and legislative chair of the
Maine Growers Alliance as well as a part of The Cannabis Council of Maine. I am 
also a shaper participant in the Seed2Health group and operate one business in the 
medical program and another business in hemp manufacturing. 
Thank you for the opportunity today to speak against LD94. This bill is a major step 
back in treating people with medical cannabis. Again, I urge the state to stay out of 
the doctor/patient relationship, it does not belong because it doesn’t have the 
education and experience. Severe conditions, such as epilepsy, are treatable with 
cannabis. These and other severe ailments do not care about the age of the human 
they plague. There are several studies showing the efficacy and safety of cannabis just
as there are studies showing the dangers of FDA approved pharmaceuticals. Does it 
make sense to allow a lethal pharmaceutical and block a non-lethal and natural 
therapeutic? Absolutely not. 
I hope that you all will vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you for your time, I’m happy to follow up with any questions.
Best,
Eben Sumner
