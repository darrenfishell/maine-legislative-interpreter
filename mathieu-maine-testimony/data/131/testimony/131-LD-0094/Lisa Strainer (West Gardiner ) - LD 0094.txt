LD 94
As a medical marijuana patient as well as someone who works in the medical 
marijuana industry I strongly oppose LD 94.
Concentrates are the backbone to the medical marijuana industry. Without them, 
many patients would suffer greatly. Concentrates provide a clean
 safe, affordable delivery of medical grade marijuana as an alternative to the age old 
way of smoking the flower. Not only do our lungs appreciate the
  concentrates, but the surrounding environment does as well. It is absolutely insane to
me that we are
 considering stopping the legal use of edibles that enable a patient relief via a gummy 
but our current health system allows the prescriptions of
deadly narcotics regularly. As someone who was prescribed both narcotic pain 
medication for debilitating endometriosis and ovarian cyst pain for 10
years, as well as benzodiazapam and a dangerously high level of hormones that put 
me in a chemically induced menopause state for my twenties. An 
entire decade.  I would never choose to go back to that treatment protocol, who 
would? I only use medical marijuana now and have way better results than
 I ever did with big pharma.
Please consider the serious implications this bill would put on our medical patient 
community.
