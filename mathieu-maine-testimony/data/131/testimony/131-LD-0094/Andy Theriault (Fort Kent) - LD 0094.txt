As a citizen of Maine, I am appalled by the proposed changes to the medical cannabis 
program put forth by Representative Walter Riseman. This bill will rob patients of the
vital medication that is so often their only source of relief, be it sprays, oils, or 
concentrates. Furthermore, this bill will compromise patient privacy, delay treatment, 
and remove the authority of medical providers to make decisions on what conditions 
can be treated with medical cannabis. 
This proposed legislation is an affront to our freedom, one that our native ancestors 
proudly fought for. We have been granted the right to pursue our health and wellbeing
and no one should have to go without medication they require due to oppressive 
government bureaucracy. We cannot allow this bill to pass- it must be rejected 
outright as it goes against the very notion of freedom and dignity.
