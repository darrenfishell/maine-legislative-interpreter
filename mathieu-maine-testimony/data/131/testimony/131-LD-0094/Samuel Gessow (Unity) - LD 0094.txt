As a caregiver who recently spent lots of time and money to setup a small business in 
Belfast I strongly oppose any changes to the current Medical cannabis program. The 
program works fine the way it is and has been a big part of the Maine economy, while
protecting patients rights and accessibility to the medicine they need. Please protect 
our medical program and stop this bill from the harm it would have on patients and 
caregivers
