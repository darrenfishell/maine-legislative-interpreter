LD 94
I oppose LD 94. The system of the medical provider issuing certification cards works 
well and protects patient privacy. Medical providers can decide if the potential 
benefits of medical cannabis use outweigh the potential risks for any patient 
condition. The proposed language would prevent the use of cannabis for common 
conditions like insomnia, generalized anxiety, end-of-life symptoms, rare neurological
conditions, and much more.Physician assistants (as well as naturopathic physicians) 
are qualified to determine if treatment with medical cannabis is indicated.
