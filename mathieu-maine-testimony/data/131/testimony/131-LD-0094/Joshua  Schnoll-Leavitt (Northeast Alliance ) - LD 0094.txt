I am a cannabis extractor in southern Maine. I have personally seen the benefits of 
high thc concentrates in our community. Many patients require higher concentrations 
of thc to properly medicate. I believe that it is essential to our medical community that
patients have full access to the medicine that helps them. I have worked in the 
industry for many years now and I have learned that like most things, everyone is 
different. So taking away a persons preferred medicine is taking away their right to 
treat their condition. I believe it is unfair and almost criminal to take away a patients 
right to choose their form of medication. 
I also believe that all current certification programs have been set up to ensure the 
security of patients. I do not believe that the government should control of 
certification and hold a list of patients. The current system allows for easy access and 
a safe transfer of information. The proposed language would prevent the use of 
cannabis for common conditions like insomnia, generalized anxiety, end of life 
symptoms, rare neurological conditions and much more. This Bill will cause 
thousands of patients to have to choose between breaking the law and risking legal 
consequences for a victimless crime or going without their medical treatment.
As a community we have worked hard to make sure that we host one of the best 
medical programs in the country. Allowing this bill to pass will ruin that reputation.
Thank you for your time.
