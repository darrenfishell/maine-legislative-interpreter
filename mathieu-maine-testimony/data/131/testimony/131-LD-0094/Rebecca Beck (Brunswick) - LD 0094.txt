I, Rebecca Beck, am opposed to this bill.  I have a brother who suffers from Multiple 
Sclerosis, who has been to many doctors, been prescribed many drugs without results.
His frustration was leading him down a road of depression and thoughts of suicide.  I 
made an appointment with Dr. Sulac.  Dr. Sulac truly listened to him.  They talked 
about limiting "flower intake" because my brother was frustrated and thought that was
the only way to "deafen" his pain, restless leg and nuerological issues, and insomnia.  
He was advised to take medicinal tinctures for sleep and pain.  My brother took his 
advise, and it was like a miracle.   His flower intake has lessened and his tinctures for 
medical reasons are helping him.  
He is under doctors care with his primary as well as Dr. Sulac.  He is learning to eat 
better, and tries  to exercise, and has more energy to enjoy his life with limited 
capacities.  I fear if this bill passes, his health will decline, and he will lose hope with 
the medical industry all together.  My brother was considering to end his life.  We 
need more holistic and organic ways to treat the ill, the depressed, and more.  I have 
seen great results in adults and children, which brings me to another testimony.  I own
a music and dance studio where I have a child who suffered from cancer who now is 
thriving in dance and the arts program.  Medicinal Marijuana helped this child get 
through such a horrible disease, and watching her dance and smile is the only 
evidence I need to oppose this bill.  
In conclusion, I feel some people don't understand how medicinal marijuana is used.   
Some people feel, "oh, its just a way to get high".  But they are wrong.  Under 
excellent doctor's care, it is a miracle drug.  Its a drug "in addition to" big Pharma.  
Only difference is Marijuana is natural.  We need to get our heads out of the sand and 
realize what God has given us naturally can heal us.
