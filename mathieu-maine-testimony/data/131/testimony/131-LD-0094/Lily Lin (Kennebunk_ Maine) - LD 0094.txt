I have a daughter who is severely disabled, non verbal, in diapers and functioning at a
toddler level even though she is legally an adult now.  For years when she was 
growing up, she was self injurious and aggressive towards others.  Thankfully, 
through the use of medical cannabis, the harmful behaviors lessened and she felt more
comfortable and emotionally stable.  Unfortunately, now she has had to go without 
because the program she is in will not allow the use of cannabis to be administered to 
her even though she has a medical card, but that is a separate issue, one that must be 
addressed at a federal level.  When she was living at home, we could give her a dose 
twice a day which helped immensely.  I am writing to voice my support to allow 
parents to provide healthcare for their kids who benefit from cannabis.  To block this 
human right to care for our families is truly a disservice.  I strongly oppose this 
change in legislation.   Thank you for your attention and valued service.
