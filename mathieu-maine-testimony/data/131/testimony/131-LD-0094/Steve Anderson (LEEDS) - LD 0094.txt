Medical marijuana has been essential for managing my back pain and my extreme 
anxiety/PTSD.  If this law is enacted, it will be far less convenient for me to get my 
recertification, and I could be forced to purchase my medicine on the black market.  
In this issue, patient's privacy rights are being ignored and trampled on, with the 
creation of a possible precedent for government control of medical decisions.  I 
suspect very few people would want the government to have a list of their 
prescription medications.  I strongly oppose this bill, and urge that it be voted down.  
Thank you.
