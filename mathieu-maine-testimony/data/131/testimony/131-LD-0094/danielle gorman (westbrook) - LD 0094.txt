LD 94
I oppose LD94 An Act Regarding the Use of Medical Cannabis by Minors.
In 2014, my 15 year old daughter, became debilitated with such severe abdominal 
pain the only thing that helped relieve her torture were narcotics. Her entire medical 
team did not want to see her continue with this strategy of pain management as they 
were concerned with the wide array of side effects and risk related to oxycontin. 
Because we were able to consult with Integr8, in collaboration with her medical team,
my daughter was able to use medical marijuana. It relieved her suffering. It took 5 
more years and three surgical procedures before the full extent of her endometriosis 
was understood. 
Had we not had the opportunity to use medical marijuana as means of pain 
management, I do not want to consider where she would be now. As her pain had 
driven her to attempt suicide before we found a viable means of helping her through 
medical marijuana.
Keep medical management required for medical marijuana. DO NOT take it off the 
table as a legitimate option. It does save lives.
