LD 94
    I want to try and convey my almost unbearable disappointment in yet another 
proposed bill (LD 94) which is clearly aimed at dismantling the medical program by 
imposing drastic restrictions.  Implementation of this bill, or any version of it, would 
have a serious negative impact on not only the 100,000+  in/out of state patients that 
benefit from the program, but the State of Maine itself as it receives substantial 
revenue from its taxes. In all honesty, the content of these propositions shows a very 
clear ignorance of what has made the Maine Medical Marijuana Program amongst the
top in the entire country.
   
    As someone who owns and operates a medical processing facility, of which the 
well-being of my family depends on, along with the families of the people I employ.   
The complete removal of concentrates from the medical program sort of flabbergasts 
me to be quite honest. It's really just another display of complete disconnect and 
ignorance with an agenda.  The full scope of benefits that concentrates provide, with 
all the various forms and vast applications, is really too great to cram into this type of 
forum. Banning concentrates would affect all patients, from those treating common 
ailments to people with more serious conditions that may require the crucial higher 
doses that they provide. 
Not to mention all the contributing tax paying entrepreneurs like myself, that have put
everything they have into the businesses that produce these concentrates. 
In conclusion;  Concentrates play a key role in a large majority of the medicinal 
products available to patients. Please vote this bill down and see it for what it is, a 
direct attack and very real danger to the future of our medical marijuana program.
