LD 94
Dear Committee member, 
 My name is Jason Kuvaja of Bridgton. I am a cannabis patient and caregiver, and I 
would like to speak out against LD 94.
 This proposal seeks to fix problems that don't exist. Needlessly adding bureaucratic 
stress to parents of very sick children, and needlessly burdens an already 
overwhelmed and under served medical system. Let parents continue to be the 
primary decider as guardians of their children.
I also object to arbitrarily setting standards of credentials for caregivers regarding 
“patient caregivers” versus “professional caregiver”. This language gives an unfair, 
unrealistic advantage based on no actual “qualification” of real merit.
Thank you for considering my stance as a voter, patient, and caregiver.
Yours truly,
Jason P Kuvaja
