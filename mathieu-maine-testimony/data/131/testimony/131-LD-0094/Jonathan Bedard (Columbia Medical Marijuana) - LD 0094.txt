Testimony Against LD 94

We operate a medical marijuana dispensary in a very rural area of Maine, we are 
the only dispensaries for half an hour in all directions. 
 
Sadly, many of our patients are end-of-life, and when they pass others come to us 
for the same reasons.  Everything from edibles to concentrates help ease their 
pain, and get them through a difficult time.  Many have led a simple life, and if 
getting a medical card was any more difficult than it is now, I do not believe they 
would bother. 
 
Medical marijuana is working for Maine citizens WHO CHOOSE TO USE IT, just like 
society knows we are not going to roll back legislation to ever allow witch trials 
again, they should take comfort in knowing that marijuana laws will not be rolled 
back and made tougher.
