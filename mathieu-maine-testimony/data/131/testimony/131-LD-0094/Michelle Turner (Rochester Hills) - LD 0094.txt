This bill would take away our human rights to seek the advice of skilled/qualified 
physicians and practitioners to treat our health conditions and to use medicine which 
will help our conditions.
 
Many Maine patients use concentrates for essential high-dose treatments.
The system of the medical provider issuing certification cards works well and protects
patient privacy - the government shouldn't have a list of cannabis patients.
Medical providers can decide if the potential benefits of medical cannabis use 
outweigh the potential risks for any patient condition. The proposed language would 
prevent the use of cannabis for common conditions like insomnia, generalized 
anxiety, end-of-life symptoms, rare neurological conditions, and much more.
Physician assistants (as well as naturopathic physicians) are qualified to determine if 
treatment with medical cannabis is indicated.
This bill will cause thousands of patients to have to choose between breaking the law 
and risking legal consequences for a victimless crime or going without their medical 
treatment.
