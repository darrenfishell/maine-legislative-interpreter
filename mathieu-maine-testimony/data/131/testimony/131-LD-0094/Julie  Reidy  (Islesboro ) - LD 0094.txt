To whom it may concern, 
The opportunity to have access to Medical cannabis through current certification 
processes has been life changing for many who suffer a myriad of ailments.  
Many in the medical community have found the benefits of Medical Cannabis  to 
patients for many common conditions such as anxiety, neurological conditions, sleep 
disorders, chronic pain and much more to be  life changing. 
Systems in place for Medical providers to issue certification cards is the most 
appropriate  process for guaranteeing the very best outcomes for patients.  
The ability for patients to work with Medical providers,  their primary care physician 
as well as a full team of care providers has proven to be significantly beneficial to 
overall patient help. 
To change the current processes for this certification will have significant negative 
impact to the patient.  
It is critical that Medical providers can continue to offer the proper assessment for 
certifications and ongoing care to those seeking to use medical cannabis to treat 
various conditions. 
I urge those here to support the current system of certification practices already in 
place in order for patients to receive the most appropriate medical treatment. 
Thank you
