LD 94
I strongly oppose LD94. It is not in the best intrest of Maine citizens who rely on 
cannabis as medication. 
Many Maine patients use concentrates for essential high dose treatments. For many 
patients concentrates are essential to a succesful treatment plan. 
The system of a medical provider issuing certification cards works well and protects 
patient privacy. The government should not have a list of cannabis patients. As they 
should not have a list of what medications any Maine residents use.  
Medical providers can decide if the potential benefits of medical cannabis use 
outweigh the potential risks for any patient condition. The proposed language would 
prevent the use of cannabis for common conditions like insomnia, generalized 
anxiety, end of life symptoms, rare neurological conditions and many other conditions
for which it is successfully used by patients who count on it. 
Physician Assistants (as well as naturopathic physicains) are qualified to determine if 
treatment with medical cannabis is indicated. 
LD94 is not good for Maine patients.
