I STRONGLY OPPOSE LD 94
This Bill  will take our Medical Cannabis program back to the beginning We as 
patients have worked very hard to be able to access good clean medicine that helps 
with hundreds of conditions and limiting the conditions again would force patients 
back to the black market and receiving unsafe medicine being laced with Fentanyl or 
other chemicals that cause death.   No patient should be put on a list with any state 
agency for their medical conditions and no state government should be the person 
who decides if I need to use cannabis or not. Removing the PA from being able to 
certify would be outrageous. We already lack doctors, NP and PA in this state for 
medical purposes. Removing Concentrates would be Horrible!!! Their are so many 
patients that use the concentrates for aiding in Cancer treatments, Post Surgery, 
Veterans with PTSD I could go on and on as there are so many people that utilize the 
different cannabis concentrates for their health needs to have a better quality of life. 
Restricting the age limit for the use of Cannabis was taken away years ago as we have
many Children whom use cannabis for their seizure conditions and there are so many 
young adults between the age of 18-21 that use cannabis for their stress and anxiety 
instead of turning to Alcohol or Addictive pharmaceutical drugs or street drugs such 
as Heroin and Cocaine that can and will harm the health and well being of those 
whom are trying to use a plant derived medicine as a healthy alternative.
