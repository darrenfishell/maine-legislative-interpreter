LD 94
This testimony is in opposition to LD 94.  This bill seems to be trying to fix 
something that is not broken.  A bill that prohibits or limits patient's access to using 
cannabis as medicine is injurious to the very citizens that the medical cannabis 
program is meant to serve. 
Proposing to have the state issue medical certifications will certainly limit patient 
access because there are bound to be delays in issuance as well as setting up 
appointments to receive a card.(This goes without mentioning the fact that there will 
then need to be additional state employees to carrying out the task of issuing these 
certifications). There is no reason for the state to start performing actions that are 
already taken care of in a much more efficient and cost effective manner by doctors, 
nurse practitioners and the like.  
Additionally, the current practitioners cited above are fully qualified to make the 
determination as to whether a patient would benefit from the use of medical cannabis. 
There is no reason to restrict those who make this determination nor limit the reason 
for determining that medical use of cannabis is appropriate. 
Lastly, prohibiting the availability of certain types of cannabis products like 
concentrates also hurts patients.  There are numerous reasons why concentrates help 
patients more than using flower or edibles.  Migraines is just one of them.  When a 
patient feels a migraine coming on they can use a concentrate to stem its onset. 
Without the option of concentrates patients will suffer unnecessarily. 
Maine's medical cannabis program is top in the nation. There is no reason to fix 
something that is not broken unless there is overwhelming evidence to back up 
suggestions such as those in LD 94.
