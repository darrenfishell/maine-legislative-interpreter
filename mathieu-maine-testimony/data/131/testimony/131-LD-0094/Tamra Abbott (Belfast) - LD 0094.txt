PLEASE consider the adverse consequences of this bill.  I have been a medical 
cannabis patient since 2010 and it seems like this bill is taking the entire medical 
cannabis program backwards. I do not know who or why this bill has been generated 
when our state has such a model program, that other states emulate.  
Specifically:
--I want my health care provider to be the one that determines if cannabis is suitable 
for me, not based on a list of "accepted" diagnoses. 
--The current registry process is working fine after many revisions over the years.  
Please leave this in the hands of my provider, not a state agency. We've been down 
this path unsuccessfully before.
--There are times I have needed concentrates for those times of illness exacerbation.  
Please do not change this.
I apologize for the late response.  I was unaware that such dramatic changes taking 
our medical cannabis program backwards were being considered.
