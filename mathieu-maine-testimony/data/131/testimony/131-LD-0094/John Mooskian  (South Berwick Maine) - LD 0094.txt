As a taxpayer, veteran & medical cannabis patient I use concentrates for essential 
high-dose treatments. I prefer the freedom to choose how to administer dosage. 
Increased freedom & access is my desire.
The system of the medical provider issuing certification cards works well and protects
patient privacy - the government shouldn't have a list of cannabis patients.
Medical providers can decide if the potential benefits of medical cannabis use 
outweigh the potential risks for any patient condition. The proposed language would 
prevent the use of cannabis for common conditions like insomnia, generalized 
anxiety, end-of-life symptoms, rare neurological conditions, and much more.
Physician assistants have served me (as well as naturopathic physicians) are qualified 
to determine if treatment with medical cannabis is indicated.
This bill will cause me & thousands of other patients to have to choose between 
breaking the law and risking legal consequences for a victimless crime or going 
without their medical treatment.
