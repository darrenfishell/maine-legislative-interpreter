I can not believe that this bill is looking to remove a medical provider such as a doctor
or Nurse Practitioner from issuing medical cannibus cards.  Three of the biggest 
reasons that people use medical cannibus are for pain, anxiety and insomnia.  I have 
had hundreds of people to confess to coming off narcotics and other prescription 
medications with the use of cannibus.
