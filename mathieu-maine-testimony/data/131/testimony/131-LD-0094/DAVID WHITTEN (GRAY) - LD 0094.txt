LD 94
GOOD MORNING,
MY NAME IS DAVID WHITTEN AND OWNER OF STICKY BUD FARMS. I 
HAVE BEEN A MEDICICAL CANNABIS CAREGIVER FOR MANY YEARS 
NOW AND HAVE HELPED THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS OVER THE YEARS.
I STRONGLY OPPOSE PRETTY MUCH ALL OF LD 94 AND FEEL THIS IS 
DETREMANTAL TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND WILL PUT MANY 
PATIENTS WITHOUT THE CRUCIAL MEDECINE THEY NEED. I WAS 
BATTLEING WITH ADDICTION TO PERCRIPTION DRUGS LIKE OXY, 
FENTANYL AND XANEX ALL PERSCRIBED BY MY DOCTOR FROM A 
BROKEN NECK IN 1993. AT THE TIME I WAS AT THE MERCY OF MY 
DOCTORS FOR PAIN MANAGMENT BUT AFTER 10 PLUS YEARS OF USING 
THESE LEGAL DRUGS ,I WAS LEFT ADDICTED AND EMOTIONALLY LOST.
THEN, I FOUND CANNABIS! IT LITERALLY SAVED MY LIFE! I STOPPED 
ALL PERCRIPTIONS AND USED ONLY CANNABIS CONCENTRATES AS 
WELL AS THE FLOWER TO HELP MY PAIN AND AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS
I WAS OFF THE FENTANYL AND GOT MY LIFE BACK! THIS MOTIVATION 
LED TO ME BECOMING A CAREGIVER AND NOW I HELP SO MANY WITH 
SO MANY ISSUES I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE. IVE HELPED MANY GET OFF 
HARD STREET DRUGS THROUGH EDUCATION AND CONCENTRATES. 
TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL WILL CAUSE MANY TO TURN FROM MEDICAL
USE TO ,WHO KNOWS! REALLY THIS IS CRAZY AND ANYTHING THAT 
WOULD INVOLVE MORE GOVERNMENT INVOLVMENT LEAVES 
PATIENTS PRIVACY ,AT RISK..  
SIMPLY PUT , THIS IS A TERRIBLE BILL AND HONESTLY I JUST CAN'T 
BELIVE WHAT I READ IN LD94 ON SO MANY LEVELS I FEEL LIKE WE'RE 
BACK IN 2011. I AM HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT THESE ISSUES TO 
ANYONE AS I FEEL ITS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE PATIENTS AND 
CAREGIVERS IN THESE ISSUES AS WE ARE THE ONES BEING IMPACTED.
