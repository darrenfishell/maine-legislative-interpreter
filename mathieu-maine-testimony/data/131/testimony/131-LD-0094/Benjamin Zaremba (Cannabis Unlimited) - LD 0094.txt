 This State Report is required by the Sober Truth on Preventing (STOP) Underage Drinking Act (Pub. 
L. 109 -422), which was enacted by Congress in 2006 and reauthorized in December 2016 as part of the 
21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114- 255).  The STOP Act requires an annual r eport “on each State's 
performance in enacting, enforcing, and creating laws, regulations, and programs to prevent or reduce 
underage drinking.”  As directed by the STOP Act, the State Reports  were prepared by the Interagency 
Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking (ICCPUD), which is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS).  
Time Period Covered by this State Report :  This State Report  primarily includes d ata from calendar 
year 2020.  Regional and state profile data were drawn from the most recently available federal survey 
data as of 2019.  State legal data reflect the status of the law as of January 1, 2020.  State survey data, 
collected in 2020, were drawn from the most recent 12-month period in which the states maintained the 
data.   
Source of Data :  For each state, overall population information was taken from 2010 Census data.  
Data about the portion of eac h state’s population comprising 12-to 20-year -olds, as well as facts about 
past-month alcohol use and binge use, were averaged from the 2016 through 2019 National Surveys on 
Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admini stration’s 
Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ), and the NSDUH special data analysis 
(2020).  Confidence intervals for these estimates are available from CBHSQ’s Division of Surveillance 
and Data Collection on request.  The Centers f or Disease Control and Prevention’s Alcohol -Related 
Disease Impact (ARDI) application served as the resource for data about alcohol -attributable deaths 
from 2011– 2015 among youth under age 21.  ARDI was also the source for state -level data on years of 
potential life lost as a result of underage alcohol -related fatalities.  The National Center for Statistics 
and Analysis’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) provided the 2019 data used to present 
statistics about fatalities among 15 - to 20-year -old dri vers.

2 | 2021 State Reports –  Underage Drinking Prevention and Enforcement   __________________________________________________ Behavioral Health System Overview7 
Overview and Organizational Structure of the Public Behavioral Health System in 
Maine  
Maine’s behavioral health system is under the purview of the Mai ne Department of Health and 
Human Services.  It currently consists of the following offices: Office of Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services (SAMHS), Office of Child and Family Services, Office of Aging and Disability Services, Office of Family Indepe ndence, the Maine Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (Maine CDC), and the Office of Maine Care Services.  
SAMHS provides statewide leadership in defining, measuring, and improving the quality of services and supports to individuals in need of substa nce abuse services across the continuum of 
care: intervention, treatment, and recovery.  In September 2012, the Office of Substance Abuse and the Office of Adult Mental Health Services were merged to form one state agency:  SAMHS.  The rationale for this c hange was to bring the various behavioral health agencies in the state 
together to further integrate and provide a more holistic milieu of services and support to the people of Maine.  The new organization consists of the office of the director and associa te 
directors, treatment and recovery staff, quality and data team, special projects, and financial and administrative personnel. 
SAMHS and Maine CDC are centralized in the capital of the state and contract with providers 
statewide to administer necessary services.  Through these contracts, SAMHS and Maine CDC 
contribute resources at the public health district level, though unlike other offices, they do not have staff located at the public health district level.  SAMHS staff is responsible for contract monit oring, providing technical assistance, and site visits to ensure quality of services being 
provided.  
Substance Abuse Prevention Program  
For several years, the state’s substance abuse prevention program was housed under the single state authority, which was  SAMHS in Augusta, Maine.  In February 2016, the prevention 
program was moved from SAMHS to the Maine CDC, to be merged with the tobacco prevention and control program.  As a result of this merger, a new program has emerged and is named the Tobacco and Substance Use Prevention and Control Program (TSUPC).  While the new program is still responsible for implementing the 20 percent set aside of the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG), they are also responsible for implementing the stat e’s 
tobacco prevention and control program.  This has provided increased visibility of substance use prevention as a public health issue and has provided increased opportunities to collaborate with other public health programs.  The new TSUPC program has f our teams that work together with 
the common goal to reduce substance and tobacco use in Maine and eliminate the consequences of such use.  These four teams include the Prevention Team, Clinical Interventions and Data Team, Policy and Communications Team, and Adolescent Health and Injury Prevention Team.  In total, there are 12 staff in this program.

 __________________________________________________  2021 State Reports –  Underage Drinking Prevention and Enforcement  | 3 Prevention Services  
Maine has a somewhat newly created (three years old) structure for the implementation of 
prevention services in the state.  This system, called Maine Prevention Services (MPS), includes five domains (Domain 1: Substance Use Prevention, Domain 2: Tobacco Use and Exposure Prevention, Domain 3: Youth Engagement, Domain 4: Mass Reach Health Communications, and Domain 5: Obesity).  The s tate of Maine contracts with five vendors to provide statewide 
services under each domain.  Each domain (with the exception of Domain 4) has sub -recipients 
who provide these services to local communities across Maine.  
Statewide substance use prevention services are being implemented through a Maine CDC 
contract with the University of New England (Domain 1 of MPS), which has 21 sub -recipients 
across Maine that are implementing prevention by using the Strategic Prevention Framework Model.  They are required to complete an assessment of their communities utilizing data from the State Epidemiological Outcomes Work Group, local -level data, and environmental scanning 
and then determine capacity to implement prevention services.  Sub- recipients then develop a 
work  plan based on those assessments after they are provided with a pre -approved list of 
interventions and activities that they can implement.  The sub- recipients implement the 
interventions, report on these monthly, and go through a process to evaluate the ef fectiveness of 
that intervention for their community.  
Expenditures for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment  
All states receive federal funds for substance abuse prevention through the SABG, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  Exhibit 1 shows the sources that Maine used for expenditures on substance abuse prevention and treatment in 2020.  As indicated, Medicaid funds and state funds account for the largest sources (34.3 percent and 33.4 percent, respe ctively).
8  
States submit Behavioral Assessment and Plan reports that include their priorities for use of SABG funds, as well as planned expenditures.  For FY 2020–2021, Maine designated reduction of alcohol and other drugs use among youth and young adult s as priority number one for use of 
SABG funds.

2011, the  STOP Act State Survey collects data on the following topics:  
1. Enforcement programs to promote compliance with underage drinking laws and regulations.  
2. Programs targeted to youth, parents, and caregivers to deter underage drinking. 
3. State interagency collaborations to implement prevention programs, best -practice standards, 
collaborations with tribal governments, and participation in underage drinking media 
campaigns.  
4. State expenditures on the prevention of underage drinking.

Additional Clarification    
In regards to whether the data provided for minors in possession arrests includes arrests/citations issued by local 
law enforcement agencies, the entity Dirigo Safety, which provided this data to the Maine Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), had this clarification to add:     
"This data does, but it is not all inclusive. It only includes the data from the 25 departments under contract with 
Dirigo for the MHHS CDC EUDL Grant. For a complete picture of state statistics, you'd need to get the statistics 
from BABLO and/or Maine Crimes. However, you should be careful not to duplicate the data. I think what we report is also simultaneously reported to BABLO and maybe Maine Crimes?"     
I requested this information from BABLO and Maine Crimes as advis ed, and they did not have numbers available to 
report.     
So, in short, the full answer to Number 8 is, "Yes, but not every 2019 instance."  
1 Or having consumed or purchased per state statutes.

Benjamin Zaremba
Cannabis Unlimited
LD 94
Hello,
I am testifying AGAINST L.D. 94. This bill not only hurts sick patients, it is also a 
direct stab at thousands of already struggling small businesses in the medical 
program. This bill is proposed to limit the sale cannabis to minors, which is illegal 
and already has rules and repercussions, yet there is no mention of Adult Use stores 
having to change how they operate.
 Medical caregivers must record the patients medical card that they have to purchase 
yearly, as well as a valid I.D., while Adult use stores only record an I.D. This means 
that for a person to buy cannabis it is more simple to go to an Adult Use store. Based 
off of this common sense, if we are going to focus on sales to minors we should worry
about Adult Use stores. Instead of a program that is was created to help sick people 
and requires more identification/doctors recommendation already. We should stop 
pestering the people who are trying to help others. If worried about minors we should 
focus on the easier route for minors, which would be an Adult use stores. 
I have attached a survey done by the state of Maine and The Interagency Coordinating
Committee on the Prevention of Underage drinking, found on stopalcoholabuse.gov. 
This survey shows that even though alcohol is illegal to anyone under the age of 21, 
in one month of 2020 alone about 141,000 minors between 12-20 abused/consumed 
alcohol in Maine. In a state of 1,344,212 people, this means over 10% of Maines 
population are minors finding and consuming alcohol. Maine’s alcohol licensing 
program is very extensive, much more established than any cannabis program. The 
government has been working for decades to regulate and stop minors, yet 141,000 
minors over 10% of our population found a way around this. Statistically, alcohol 
causes far more harm and in 2020 alone caused 10 underage deaths in Maine. I do not
want to compare alcohol, which causes harm and deaths, to cannabis. The point to be 
taken from this data is that very regulated and long established industries have failed 
time and time again to stop underage consumption. This being said, it is not logical to 
focus resources on a small helpful medical program than a large, profit driven, easier 
accessible adult use program. 
This bill proposes that Caregivers can no longer help people searching for relief with 
a medical card from another state. There are thousands of patients who rely on 
caregivers to have a normal quality of life. These patients who take the time to travel 
to our beautiful state for help, also in turn are paying taxes on their purchases and 
stimulating Maine’s economy. In such a tough economic time, it would not make 
sense that the state would want to reduce their income and also hurt thousands of 
small businesses at the same time.
Without question, protecting minors and keeping them safe should always be the top 
priority. This bill seems to care more about a few kids who tried to buy cannabis, 
more than the countless amount of patients who rely and would not have quality of 
life without. These patients shouldn’t be punished for the wrongdoing of a few bad 
apples that may or may not exist. If preventative measures should be taken, it should 
be with the easier accessible adult use stores. 
If this bill is to stop minors from accessing cannabis illegally, it would be intelligent 
to focus on Adult Use stores who have much higher traffic and only need one form of 
I.D. to purchase. It doesn’t matter if the human is 12 or 85 years old, humans take the 
path of least resistance, in cannabis the easiest path is adult use stores and not medical
caregivers. Being 21 years old has never stopped minors from drinking recreational 
alcohol, we shouldn’t expect anything different from Adult Use recreational cannabis 
as directly shown in the attached data.
This bill also proposes that medical patients with a valid out of state card should not 
be able to get help from a caregiver in Maine. This is sad and a cruel that anyone 
would want to limit the wellbeing of another human. This is directly hurting sick 
people who have proudly supported maine caregivers that are known to be the most 
helpful medical providers in the East Coast. People travel from far and plan trips to 
come to Maine, just to receive help because it is the best they can get. As a state, we 
should be extremely proud of the positive impact this does to our world. Patients 
cannot receive the same quality cannabis from Adult use stores. Patients will not 
come here for recreational cannabis they can buy almost anywhere now. Adult use 
cannabis is not the same as medical cannabis. Adult use is grown for pure profit while
medical is grown with the intention to be the highest grade possible even if the profit 
margin is lower. Stopping out of state patients while allowing anyone from out of 
state to buy from adult use stores only makes sense if people care about money over 
human well-being. Does the state of Maine care about money more than human life 
and health? From what I have witnessed in my life, here in Maine we put human life 
first. 
Caregivers are well informed on who benefits and profits from the harmful agenda of 
L.D 94. It is abundantly clear that patients, caregivers, and many family owned small 
businesses are under attack from the large corporations and people who have a vested 
interest. The amount of bills proposed in the last 6 months alone that would suppress 
the medical system and benefit adult use is not only absurd, but a waste of taxpayers 
money. Every other state in the country besides Maine has had their small business 
medical system destroyed by large corporations who lobby for their own profit and 
agendas. It is clear that this agenda benefits Adult use stores, and harms medical 
caregivers. Maine has allowed for these small businesses to flourish and now it is 
partially their duty to protect and preserve patients rights and small business 
caregivers livelihoods by not supporting silly bill such as L.D 94. 
L.D 94 has a good intention to stop minors from buying cannabis. But the fact is that 
this is already highly illegal and also a rare occurrence. Medical caregivers are not a 
risk to minors, adult use cannabis promotes the recreational use far more and sends a 
message that it is for fun, and not to health. Minors are consuming for recreational 
uses and not medical, or they would have a medical card. This bill would harm 
thousands of people who are trying their best to find relieve and to help others find 
relief. L.D. 94 causes far more harm to patients than it ever could protect minors, 
therefore I am strongly against this bill.
Thank you for your time.
