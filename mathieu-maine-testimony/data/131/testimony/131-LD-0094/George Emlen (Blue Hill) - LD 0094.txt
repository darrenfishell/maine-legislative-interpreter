Medical marijuana has been a godsend for me. I am 78 years old and have been 
dealing with oral/head and neck cancer for 11 years. I attribute my survival to my 
prescribed use of marijuana in concentrate form to eradicate or at least slow down the 
progress of my cancer. The certification process by my medical provider has been a 
critical component of this treatment plan, and it would be detrimental to my efforts to 
fight this cancer if access to this process were compromised. Thank you for 
considering my testimony against this bill.
