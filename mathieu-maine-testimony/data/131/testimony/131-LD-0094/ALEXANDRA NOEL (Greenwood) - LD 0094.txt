LD 94
Many Maine patients use concentrates for essential high dose treatments. There are so
many patients that rely on concentrates for their only source of medicine, as it's a 
quicker and cleaner way to receive the dosage you need. 
The system of the medical provider issuing certification cards works well and protects
patient privacy â€“ the government should not have a list of cannabis patients. Medical 
providers can decide if the potential benefits of medical cannabis use outweigh the 
potential risks for any patient condition. The proposed language would prevent the 
use of cannabis for common conditions like insomnia, generalized anxiety, end of life 
symptoms, rare neurological conditions and much more. Again, as a medical patient 
myself that deals with daily nausea from a gastrointestinal disease, I rely on medical 
cannabis to eat, sleep, and function in my daily life. It has been such a relief to me 
after trying countless prescription medications that did nothing but cause painful side 
effects. If LD94 is passed, me along with countless other patients will lose access to 
the medicine they count on. 
Physician Assistants (as well as naturopathic physicains) are qualified to determine if 
treatment with medical cannabis is indicated.
LD94 would set back the Maine Medical Program years. We have fought for so long 
to build one of the best medical programs in the country and we as a community of 
caregivers will not let this happen silently. 
Thank you for your consideration.
