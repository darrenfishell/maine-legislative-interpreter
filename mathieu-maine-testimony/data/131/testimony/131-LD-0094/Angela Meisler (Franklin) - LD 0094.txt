LD 94
Good morning.
I am writing today in opposition to LD 94.  These are the areas of my concern.
Many Maine patients use concentrates for essential high-dose treatments.
The system of the medical provider issuing certification cards works well and protects
patient privacy. The state should not have a list of cannabis patients.
Medical providers can decide if the potential benefits of medical cannabis use 
outweigh the potential risks for any patient condition.
The proposed language would prevent the use of cannabis for common conditions like
insomnia, generalized anxiety, end-of-life symptoms, rare neurological conditions, 
and much more.
Physician assistants (as well as naturopathic physicians) are qualified to determine if 
treatment with medical cannabis is indicated.
This bill will cause thousands of patients to have to choose between breaking the law 
and risking legal consequences for a victimless crime or going without their medical 
treatment.
We've worked hard to create one of the very best medical cannabis programs in the 
country. These changes would substantially damage it. Causing irreparable damage to
Maines medical patients, caregivers and thousands of small business owners and their 
employees.
I encourage you to vote against it.
Thank you for your consideration.
