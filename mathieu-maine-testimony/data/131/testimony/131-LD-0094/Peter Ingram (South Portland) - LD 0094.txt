LD 94
We've worked hard as a community to create a robust medical cannabis program that 
puts the health care choices in the hands of the patients and their practitioners - where 
it belongs!  
I urge the Committee not to support LD 94.
I've worked with cannabis patients, medical providers and the families of patients for 
almost a decade as a Caregiver and I have seen cannabis work on some patients for 
certain conditions and not work for other patients with the same conditions.  Because 
cannabis effects each individual differently based upon their individual 
endocannabinoid system, it's not possible for the same dosages to help all patients.  
Furthermore, limiting qualifying conditions will certainly leave some people with no 
alternative but to try and find their medicine in the black market.  This is bad for the 
patient (unregulated product) and the last thing our industry, which is seeing thinner 
margins, needs.
