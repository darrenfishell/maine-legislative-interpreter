LD 94
As an Administrative Assistant here at MMCM...I see so many patients that this 
LD94 amendment would affect in such a negative way.   These folks rely on their 
meds and medical cards to be able to obtain their medicine.  Their privacy matters.  In
this world today, there are not enough Doctors for the existing patients there is today. 
My primary care Doctor had to close her practice. I myself, have to wait until July  
(two times appointment pushed out) for a general Doctors appointment due to the 
shortage of physicians.  To limit the conditions...how can you just stop having access 
to your meds mid stream because its not on the "List".  If you know anything about 
the medical use of cannabis..this would all make sense to you.
have these amendments
