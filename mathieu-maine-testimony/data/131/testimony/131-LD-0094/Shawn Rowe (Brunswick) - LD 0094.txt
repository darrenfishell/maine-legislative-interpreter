I truly cannot believe that you are considering this change in this day and age. The 
government is not fit to dictate who can use what medicine for what condition or 
symptom. Banning concentrates for medical use is an asinine idea. Concentrates are 
often used for patients who require a high dose to achieve relief from their condition, 
and everybody's body chemistry is different. Some people can use 5-10 mg of 
Cannabinoids and feel relief. Others may need as much as hundreds of milligrams to 
feel relief. The whole idea is like saying "Only Tylenol works for my headaches, so I 
propose a ban on Advil." This is not helping anybody. Imagine finding the one 
medication that works for your rare condition, and when you go to the pharmacy, the 
pharmacist says " Oh sorry, somebody who has no medical degree or education on the
matter had a firm opinion on this medication, and they decided you shouldn't have it 
anymore."
I know in your likely firm opinion Mr. Riseman, you probably skipped most of this 
short testimony, but I'll sum it up for you. You're a slimy scumbag who has NO 
business even proposing such ridiculously harmful ideas. SHAME ON YOU!
