Many Maine patients to use concentrates for high dose treatments. I know many 
people who suffer so horribly from pain they cant sleep at night and consuming 
cannabis via concentrate is the only relief  they get. THE SYSTEM FOR MEDICAL 
CARDS IS NOT BROKEN. It works well and protects my privacy. I trust my nurse 
and doctors to help me decide if  using cannabis outweighs my other ailments. The 
language used in this could effect SO MANY PEOPLE who need negatively.
