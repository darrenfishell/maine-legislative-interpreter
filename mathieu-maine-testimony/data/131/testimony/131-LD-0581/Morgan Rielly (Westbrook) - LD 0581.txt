 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly on  
 LD 581, “  An Act to Assist Municipal Shellfish Conservation   Programs   ” 
 Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resour ces 
 Good   afternoon   Senator   Reny ,  Representative   Hepler   and  distinguished   members   of  the  Joint  
 Standing   Committee   on  Marine   Resources.   My  name   is  Morgan  Rielly ,  and  I  represent   House  
 District   127,  which   includes   part  of  Westbrook.   I  am  here  today   to  present   LD  581,  An  Act  to 
 Assist Municipal Shellfish Conservation Pr ograms   . 
 Many   of  our  coastal   communities   have   municipal   shellfish   conservation   programs.   These  
 programs   are  vital  for  protecting   Maine’ s  coastal   environment.   Shellfish   filter   the  water   they  are 
 in,  which   helps   remove   marine   biotoxins   and  chemical   contaminants   along   with  controlling  
 harmful   algae   blooms.   For  example,   one  adult   oyster   can  filter   more   than  50  gallons   of  ocean  
 water   in  a  day.  Shellfish   also  play  a  role  in  minimizing   the  impacts   of  the  climate   crisis   by 
 protecting shorelines from erosion and storms.  
 These   programs   make   sure  that  Maine’ s  coastal   waters   remain   clean,   pure,   and  suitable   for 
 marine   vegetation   and  organisms.   This  bill  will  make   it  easier   for  communities   to  set  up  their 
 own LP A. I ur ge the committee to vote ought to pass.  
 Thank   you  very  much   for  your  time  and  consideration.   I  would   be  happy   to  answer   any  questions  
 or to provide you with any information for your upcoming work session.
