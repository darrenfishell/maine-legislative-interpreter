Thank you for providing me the opportunity to submit written testimony on this issue. My name is Alex 
de Koning. I am the co-owner and CEO of Hollander and de Koning mussel in Trenton Maine. I live in Bar 
Harbor. 
I write to you to testify in support of LD581. 
Way back in 1773 my ancestors in holland realized that the wild mussel harvest there was not 
sustainable due to over harvesting, and wasted resources. They made the decision to start managing the 
wild mussels as farmed beds, moving the seed, thinning it out, and protecting it before harvest. Now, 
250 years later, there is a thriving industry that is providing jobs, food, and fantastic ecosystem benefits. 
This all built on harvesters taking a vested interest in protecting, and caring for their resources. As we all 
know, the softshell clam industry is struggling with warming waters, and the green crabs that has bought 
in. LD 581 will remove the LPA application fee for a municipality, this lowers the barrier to starting to 
protect and restore the wild resources with aquaculture practices, and that is a good thing. 
Thank you for your time. 
Alex de Koning
