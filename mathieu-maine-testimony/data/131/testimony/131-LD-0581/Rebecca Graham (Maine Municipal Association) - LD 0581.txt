Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association
In Support of
LD 581- An Act to Assist Municipal Shellfish Conservation Programs
March 9, 2023
Sen. Reny, Rep. Hepler and distinguished members of the Marine Resources Committee, my 
name is Rebecca Graham and I am providing testimony in support of LD 581, An Act to Assist Municipal 
Shellfish Programs, on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association which represents the collective 
interests of municipal government for the legislature. The positions of the Association are determined 
by our 70 member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC) who are elected by their selectboards and city 
councils in Maine’s 35 Senate districts. 
MMA’s LPC supports the intent of LD 581 as it seeks to prevent government from being assessed 
a fee for the work of municipal shellfish conservation committees for the protection of shell fish 
resources in communities. The limited purpose license was intended to explore the culture of certain 
shellfish and marine algae for a determinate period of time and in small areas. This is important to the 
activities for shellfish conservation committees who are exploring ways their communities can pivot to 
other harvesting activities and the impacts on existing resources, particularly those communities who 
may be at high risk for losing their traditional harvesting industries to climate-related changes. 
Municipal officials ask that you consider ways to limit the licensing fees, and benefit from the 
information received by such municipally supported projects in partnerships with harvesters and schools 
who may also be interested in using such projects to create experiential learning opportunities for their 
local students.
