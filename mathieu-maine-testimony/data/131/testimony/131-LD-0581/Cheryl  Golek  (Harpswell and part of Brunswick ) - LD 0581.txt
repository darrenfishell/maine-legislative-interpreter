District 99: Brunswick (Part), HarpswellTestimony of Rep. Cheryl Golek in support of
LD 581, An Act to Assist Municipal Shellfish Conservation Programs
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources
Senator Reny, Representative Hepler and distinguished members of the Marine Resources 
Committee, my name is Cheryl Golek and I represent House District 99 which consists of the 
Town of Harpswell and part of Brunswick. I write in support of LD 581, An Act to Assist 
Municipal Shellfish Conservation Programs. 
LD 581 will waive the application fee for municipal shellfish conservation. Waving these 
application fees will reduce unnecessary costs and help them to continue their success more 
economically for their committees and there working waterfront communities.
I represent a working waterfront community. This bill will create needed support for our 
municipal shellfish committees to continue to build up on the success they have already seen. In 
addition, our municipal shellfish conservation work has made our stateâ€™s shellfish the most 
sustainable fishery in my view. These successes benefit our state as a whole and feed our 
economy and they should be rewarded for their achievements.  
In conclusion, I am asking that the committee vote ought to pass on this very important 
legislation. Thank you.
