Good afternoon, chairpersons Carney and Moonen, and all members of the Judiciary 
Committee.  
 
My name is Josie Phillips, and I am representing Maine Center for Economic Policy. I am 
testifying in favor of LD 564, “An Act to Improve Access to Civil Legal Services,” because it 
helps to ensure that our complicated legal system functions effectively for all Mainers.  
 
The legal system at every level  — state and federal, civil and criminal  — is complicated. So 
complicated that receiving a law degree alone takes three years ,1 and those who study the law 
often are highly specialized in specific fields. This complexity is a good thing in that it allows our 
laws to be as diverse and detailed as the people and situations to which they apply. Th e law’s 
complicated nature also means that engaging with the legal system — understanding the rights, 
responsibilities, and avenues for recourse available to everyone — is virtually impossible for 
people who have not spent significant amounts of time study ing how our laws and the courts 
that enforce them operate. Because of this, the very people the law is meant to protect are often 
rendered unable to properly exercise their rights or understand what options they have for 
justice under the legal system.  
 
Legal representation can act as a bridge between people engaged in legal proceedings and 
their rights under the law, helping ensure that all parties receive the justice they are due. 
However, this legal representation is not guaranteed to people involved i n civil cases and is 
often prohibitively expensive to acquire, especially to people with low incomes. This means that 
people involved in civil cases — and most Maine  households  with low income s face at least one 
civil legal issue  per year2 — are often at a stark disadvantage when it comes to these 
proceedings. We can see this disadvantage reflected in eviction data . In eviction cases, only 20 
percent of  Maine  tenants have legal representation, compared to 81 percent of landlords .3 
When tenants have representation, their odds of experiencing eviction decline dramatically .4 
One study involving eviction trial data from New York City found that receiving legal 
representation decreased tenants’ odds of having an eviction issued against them by more than 
two thirds .5 Access to legal representation for tenants with l ow income is particularly important 
given the severity of Maine’s affordable housing crisis, with eviction filings increasing by 27

 percent between 2021 and 2022 .6 By preventing unfair or illegal evictions, funding civil legal aid 
also helps provide housing stability to many renters.  
 
LD 564 would help stem the tide of evictions , increasing housing security across the state, 
which then provides crucial stability to the state’s economy.7 LD 564 would also  make our civil 
legal system fairer  for Mainers with low incomes by providing necessary funding for civil legal 
aid. This legal aid is crucial to the wellbeing of Mainers — more than 350,000 of whom are 
eligible f or free civil legal services  but may not be able to  access these services  due to lack of 
funding .8 Without it, Maine’s civil legal system will become  even more  inaccessible to the people 
most in need of justice and further stacked in the favor of those with the resources to navigate 
the system. Because of the support this bill provides to Mainers with low incomes and to the 
state’s civil legal system a s a whole, I encourage this committee to vote yes on LD 564.
