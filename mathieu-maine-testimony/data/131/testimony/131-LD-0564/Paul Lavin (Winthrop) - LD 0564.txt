Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Judiciary ,
My
name
is
Paul
Lavin
and
I
am
a
resident
of
W inthrop.
I
worked
for
Legal
Services
for
the
Elderly
for
ten
years,
first
as
a
Helpline
attorney
and
then
as
the
Executive
Director
from
2002
to
2005.
After
leaving
LSE
and
until
my
retirement
in
2021,
I
had
been
the
Assistant
Director
of
the
Maine
Ethics
Commission
for
fifteen
years.
I
am
submitting
my
testimony
in
support
of
L.D.
564,
An
Act
to
Improve
Access
to
Civil
Legal
Services.
L.D.
564
presents
a
two-fold
opportunity .
First,
the
increased
funding
will
maintain
the
progress
Maine
has
made
in
the
past
two
years
in
improving
access
to
justice
for
Mainers
who
need
legal
help
but
cannot
af ford
an
attorney .
Second,
the
funding
will
build
on
that
progress
and
expand
the
legal
resources
to
help
even
more
low-income
and
vulnerable
Mainers.
Some
of
the
most
vulnerable
are
older
Mainers.
One
out
of
every
three
Mainers
over
65
has
income
below
200%
of
the
federal
poverty
level.
1
Social
Security
is
the
sole
source
of
income
for
seventy
percent
(70%)
of
low-income
seniors.
The
average
monthly
Social
Security
benefit
in
2023,
according
to
AARP ,
is
$1,827
and
many
older
Mainers
receive
far
less.
After
paying
for
housing,
health
care,
food,
electricity ,
heating,
and
transportation
-
all
of
which
cost
more
and
more
each
year
-
there
is
little,
if
anything,
left
to
hire
an
attorney
to
handle
a
legal
matter ,
no
matter
how
ur gent.
According
to
studies,
over
50%
of
low-income
seniors
will
experience
a
legal
problem
in
a
year
and
many
will
experience
more
than
one.
2
These
legal
problems
-
eviction
and
foreclosure,
benefit
denials,
physical
abuse,
financial
scams
and
exploitation
-
af fect
older
Mainers’
health,
security
and
independence.
In
all
of
these
cases,
legal
intervention
is
the
only
means
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
older
person.
But
the
vast
majority
of
these
seniors
do
not
get
the
legal
help
they
need,
resulting
in
negative
outcomes
leading
to
a
diminished
quality
of
life.

capacity ,
civil
legal
services
providers
could
prevent
those
outcomes
by
providing
legal
help
to
more
vulnerable
Mainers.
Maine’ s
civil
legal
services
providers,
through
their
skillfulness,
dedication
and
creativity ,
have
done
more
to
serve
the
needs
of
low-income
and
vulnerable
Mainers
than
one
would
think
possible
given
their
small
numbers
and
budgets.
Maine’ s
private
bar
has
been
truly
generous
with
their
donations
to
the
Campaign
for
Justice
and
thousands
of
hours
of
pro
bono
work.
But
the
legal
resources
available
today
are
overwhelmed
by
the
present
needs
of
low-income
and
vulnerable
Mainers.
And
the
gap
widens
each
year
as
the
need
for
legal
assistance
only
increases.
The
increased
funding
for
the
Maine
Civil
Legal
Services
Fund
in
L.D.
564
won’ t
close
that
gap
entirely ,
but
it
will
make
a
dif ference
for
the
better
in
the
lives
of
thousands
of
Mainers.
W ith
this
funding,
the
providers
will
be
able
to
increase
staf fing
to
handle
more
cases,
expand
their
excellent
technology
and
self-help
tools,
and
serve
more
communities
with
their
outreach
and
educational
ef forts.
I
ur ge
you
to
vote
unanimously
Ought
to
Pass
on
L.D.
564.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify .
