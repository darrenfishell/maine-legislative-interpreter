Testimony of Robyn Merrill, Maine Equal Justice 
In support of LD 564 “An Act to Improve Access to Civil Legal 
Services ” 
March 21, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and esteemed members of the Committee on 
Judiciary. My name is Robyn Merrill, and I am the Executive Director of Maine Equal Justice. We area 
civil legal services organization, and we work with and for people with low income to increase economic 
security, opportunity, and equity in Maine. We accomplish our mission through: (1) public policy advocacy 
in the legislature and with governmental agencies; (2) legal representation and impact litigation on systemic 
issues; and (3) statewide outreach and training on issues affecting people with low income. 
Maine Equal Justice strongly supports LD 564 because collectively, despite our best efforts and strong 
coordination and collaboration, Maine’s legal aid providers cannot come close to meeting people’s legal 
needs without additional resources to make that possible. And the need for legal services is only growing. 
This winter Maine families have faced unprecedented challenges due to the high cost of housing, gas, and 
food. Some forms of federal relief have or will be expiring despite the continued need. Affordable housing 
is out of reach for tens of thousands of Mainers. 
At MEJ, We focus our work on issues that affect people’s daily lives — access to adequate health care, food, 
housing, income, employment, and higher education and training opportunities. We work to assist people 
struggling to meet their basic needs and to open up economic opportunities so that people can move out of 
poverty permanently. 
The Maine Civil Legal Services Fund (MCLSF) enables us to provide statewide legal representation, 
administrative advocacy, and outreach and training for Mainers with low income. Notably, the MCLSF does 
not fund our legislative advocacy or any of the lobbying we do. We focus our systemic work on the most 
pressing community needs identiﬁed through our legal services, community outreach, and collaboration with 
other organizations, providers, and agencies. 
Systemic legal aid is legal service provided on behalf of a group of people with low income, with the intention 
of advancing or protecting the rights of all those similarly situated. Systemic legal aid is a key component of 
Maine’s legal aid network. It is the most cost-effective and far-reaching way to advance or protect legal rights 
when a group of people with low income encounter essentially the same legal problem. 
The American Bar Association ’s Standard for the Provision of Civil Legal Aid provides:
“Legislative and administrative processes are an essential part of the legal system that affect the 
low-income population. Many administrative agencies adopt rules, regulations, policies and orders of 
general application that have lasting impact on low income persons. Some recurring problems 
affecting clients can only be resolved by legislative action or through a rule change by an 
administrative agency. Legal aid providers, because of their knowledge of the legal problems of low 
income persons, can have a signiﬁcant impact on legal interpretations, regulations, rules, policies, and 
the ways that these are carried out by government agencies, with direct effects on the lives of low 
income Mainers? “ 
MEJ’s legal services team hears from an increasing number of people who struggle to access public programs 
and support for which they are eligible. The high level of inﬂation has made basic needs harder to meet and 
lowered the value of public assistance dollars. As the cost of living rises and ﬁnancial hardship increases, 
individuals, families, and caseworkers increasingly turn to us to help navigate complex programs and systems. 
A lack of affordable housing has become a major crisis for Mainers with low income. More households are at 
risk of eviction and homelessness —~and of the cascading events that push them deeper into poverty. 
Our legal services team does its best to meet the needs of these individuals and to address the systemic 
problems inherent in their eases, but with current resources it is not possible to adequately address the demand 
More capacity is desperately needed. For this reason, we strongly urge you to support LD 564. 
We are grateful to you for the Work you are doing to ensure access to justice for all Maine residents. Thank 
you. I’1n happy to answer any questions you might have.

The familiar phrase "with liberty and justice for all” states our core value that ina 
truly free society justice must be accessible to everyone. 
Justice for all requires investment in both criminal and civil 
legal services. ln criminal cases, the accused has a right toa 
lawyer. Like criminal cases, civil legal problems can threaten 
people's livelihoods, health, or families in profound ways, 
yet there is no right to counsel. Every year, thousands of 
Mainers must face civil legal problems without help, 
including foreclosure, eviction, property disputes, domestic 
abuse, probating estates, ﬁnancial exploitation, disability 
discrimination in housing, education and employment, and 
more. 
Most low-income Mainers face at least one civil legal issue 
each year that cannot be fairly resolved without legal advice 
or effective legal advocacy. ‘ When people wrestle with the 
complexities of legal issues and the courts on their own, the 
promise of equal justice under our laws remains unfulﬁlled: 
people who face serious legal issues without a lawyer have 
worse outcomes from the court system, with less fairness and 
increased costs for all involved. 
Thegoal ofcivil legal aid isto provide legal helpto everyone 
who needs it but is unable to afford it. Unfortunately, 
the legal needs of many Mainers in civil matters are going 
unmet, and in recent years civil legal aid providers have been 
challenged to do more with less. 
This year, we must take steps to fulﬁll the promise of equal 
justice by investing more in civil legal aid services throughout 
the state. That investment will put real money back into our 
local economy and change people's lives for the better? Maine's Civil Legal Aid Providers... 
V Offer a range of legal assistance, from representation, 
advice, and legal self-help tools to advocacy that 
advances and protects the legal interests of similarly 
situated groups of low-income people.’ 
V are virtually the sole source of legal representation for 
over 360,000 low-income Mainers. 
V provide legal help to people facing many of life's 
crises and turning points: the custody of a child, the 
loss of a home, essential services to veterans, ﬁnancial 
exploitation, the need for asylum, domestic violence, 
unemployment, food insecurity. 
0/ avert the pitfalls of addressing legal problems without 
legal training, which is like acting as your own doctor in 
the hospital. 
\/ provide direct legal services that result in tangible cost 
saving to our state and an inﬂux of millions of dollars 
into Maine's economy. ‘ 
V streamline the court system and cut down on court 
costs, by moving cases that must be in court more 
quickly and by resolving matters outside of court or other 
formal proceedings. 
Maine needs to invest more in access to civil legal aid. An additional investment appropriated last year of $1 .3 million is helping 
legal aid providers maintain operations and ﬁll detrimental funding gaps, but the allocation is not sufﬁcient to meet the current 
and growing needs of Maine's residents and court system. 
With an investment of $3.9M in the ﬁrst budget year, and $7.8M in the second budget year, passage of LD S64 would allow 
Maine's civil legal aid providers to take signiﬁcant steps to meet unmet legal needs in Maine. 
This investment would: 
|/ Preserve existing legal aid capacity (that would otherwise be lost due to an anticipated 0' 
loss in ARPA funds at the end of 2023).

Maine s Cl\/ll legal aid providers represent 
in all 16 counties. 
Civil legal aid providers: 
V Serve those who have served: Maine has the highest 
percentage of veterans living in rural areas in the United 
States. Veterans are especially in need of information about 
their rights under federal and state law and legal advocacy 
to enforce those rights. These legal services are not available 
from traditional veteran service organizations. 
s/Address the housing crisis in Maine. Maine landlords 
are represented in more than 80% of eviction cases, while 
tenants are represented less than 20% of the time. In eviction 
cases, tenants with an attorney are much more likely to avoid 
an eviction, which is the leading cause of homelessness. 
Legal aid providers have developed resources for tenants 
facing eviction, and are advancing solutions to ensure that 
housing is affordable and accessible to every Maine resident. 
Between 2019 and 2022, providers have seen a signiﬁcant 
increase in demand for services on housing related issues. 
u/Support people who need Protection from Abuse 
(PFA). Civil legal aid providers have continued to go to court 
to provide in-person representation to victims of domestic 
violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The number and 
severity of such cases has markedly increased since 2019. 
Providers also offer remote assistance to these clients. 
V Help for iow-wage immigrants. Legal aid providers are 
assisting Mainers who are immigrants to make ends meet 
and enter or re-enter the workforce. They are assuring that 
people seeking asylum meet their one-year ﬁling deadlines, 
and are helping immigrant victims of domestic violence who 
are trapped in abusive relationships. 
V Streamline access to affordabie health care. Providers 
have assisted hundreds of Mainers across the state to access 
the health care coverage they need to stay safe and well. thousands of Maine residents each year 
Despite shrinking resources, signiﬁcant challenges, 
and more complicated and urgent cases to handle, 
Maine's legal aid providers were able to represent 
Mainers facing crises in all 16 counties.
