 March 16, 2023To whom it may concern,My name is Lisa Cunningham and I was in a very dismantling and hostile relationship for a dozen years before I acquired the services that Lisa chase of Pine Tree Legal in Presque Isle Maine and her associates provided. I was in extreme dire need of help for legal council because I knew my husband and his long-term lawyer friend would play the justice system to their own tune with the objective being to dismantle me even further during the divorce process after the atrocities that I was put through as a wife. They used the justice system like a game. They had no concern for me as a human being or truth or honor throughout the entire process and hit below the belt often and continuously, simply to win. I knew that without a lawyer in my corner, I would have continued to be dismantled in a very unjust way because of the nature of the difference between my husband being a psychopath and me always choosing the highroad. Without Lisa Chase from Pine Tree Legal and all of her associates to inject the balance  I needed to understand the law and the process of law, I would have been destroyed! Instead, she secured me a 68k settlement that carried me thru the aftermath of my abuse and provided me with the ability to become a contributing member of society which is where I belong! And not only as a citizen, but as a published author that promotes personal empowerment for other women that have experienced similar dismantling relationships.  Because of the settlement of 68k that Lisa and her office secured for me - helping me every step of the way - I can also contribute to good things. Thank you for any consideration,
Lisa Cunningham
