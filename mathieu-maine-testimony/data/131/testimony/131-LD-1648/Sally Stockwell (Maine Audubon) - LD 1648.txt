RE:
LD
1648,
An
Act
to
Make
Changes
to
the
Farm
and
Open
Space
T ax
Law
Dear
Chair
Grohoski,
Chair
Perry ,
and
Members
of
the
T axation
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1648,
An
Act
to 
Make
Changes
to
the
Farm
and
Open
Space
T ax
Law ,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our 
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
Maine
Audubon
supports
this
legislation
as
an 
important
natural
resource
conservation
and
climate
change
mitigation
strategy .
Maine’ s
Open
Space
Law
plays
a
key
role
in
recognizing
and
incentivizing
private
landowners
to
manage
their
private
land
to
provide
public
benefits.
The
law
allows
town
assessors
to
lower
property
taxes
for
a
landowner
in
exchange
for
maintaining
and
enhancing
open
space
that
conserves
woods,
waters,
and
wildlife,
and
that
is
often
open
to
the
public
for
hunting,
fishing,
and
other
types
of
recreation.
However ,
the
current
law
is
in
need
of
a
refresh
to
better
support
private
landowners
and
better
conserve
a
more
complex
set
of
open
space
values.
Under
the
proposed
bill,
landowners
who
enroll
in
the
program
would
immediately
be
eligible
for
a
50%
tax
deduction
from
the
open
space
valuation
if
they
agree
to
maintain
that
open
space
as
open
space
for
a
ten-year
time
period
(the
open
space
valuation
is
set
at
twice
the
T ree
Growth
T ax
Program
valuation
established
for
that
county).
As
proposed
in
LD
1648,
a
landowner
could
apply
for
an
additional
25-50%
reduction
from
the
open
space
valuation
if
they
agree
to
add
one
or
two
of
the
following:
(1)
Allow
public
access
(25%).
(2)
Permanently
protect
that
open
space
(25%).
(3)
Develop
and
implement
a
wildlife
habitat
management
plan
for
the
open
space
in
collaboration
with
the
Department
of
Inland
Fisheries
and
W ildlife
or
Department
of
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry
(25%).
(4)
Develop
and
implement
a
carbon
conservation
plan
that
is
signed
by
a
licensed
forester
or
soil
scientist
and
submitted
to
the
Department
of
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry
for
approval
(25%).
The
bill
calls
for
simplifying
the
valuation
calculations,
making
them
easier
for
both

landowners
and
assessors
to
understand
and
calculate;
adds
credit
for
developing
a
carbon
conservation
plan
and
simplifies
requirements
for
the
wildlife
habitat
management
plan.
At
the
end
of
any
ten-year
period,
the
landowner
may
re-enroll,
add
or
subtract
categories,
and
provide
updated
wildlife
management
plans
and/or
carbon
conservation
plans
that
spell
out
activities
for
the
next
ten-year
time
period.
As
development
pressures
are
increasing
across
the
state,
no
trespassing
signs
are
going
up
in
places
where
they
never
existed
before,
numerous
wildlife
species
and
overall
biodiversity
are
showing
dramatic
declines,and
impacts
from
climate
change
are
escalating,
this
is
a
great
time
to
streamline
and
expand
our
program
that
recognizes
landowners
who
are
willing
to
protect
open
space
and
its
various
public
values.
As
a
wildlife
conservation
or ganization,
we
are
especially
excited
and
thankful
for
opportunities
to
recognize
landowners
who
provide
clean
water ,
habitat
for
a
myriad
of
fish
and
wildlife
species,
and
increased
carbon
sequestration
and
storage.
Providing
permanent
protection
of
open
space
and
public
access
for
nature-based
recreation
are
additional
key
benefits.
This
bill
is
a
win-win-win
for
all.
W e
ur ge
the
Committee
to
support
this
legislation.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
Sincerely ,
Sally
Stockwell
Director
of
Conservation
