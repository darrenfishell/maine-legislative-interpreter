Testimony of 
DANA A. DORAN 
Executive Director 
Professional Logging Contractors of Maine 
Before the Committee on Taxation in Support of LD 1648 — An Act To Make 
Changes to the Farm and Open Space Tax Law 
Wednesday, May 17, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation, my name is Dana Doran, and I am the Executive Director of the Professional Logging 
Contractors of Maine The Professional Logging Contractors of Maine (PLC) 1S the voice of 
logging and associated trucking contractors throughout the state of Maine The PLC was formed 
in 1995 to represent independent contractors in a rapidly changing forest industry 
As of 2021, logging and trucking contractors in Maine employed over 3,000 people directly and 
were indirectly responsible for the creation of an additional 2,500 _]0bS This employment and 
the investments that contractors make contributed $582 million to the state’s economy Our 
membership, which includes 200 contractor members and an additional 120 associate 
members, employs more than 75% of the individuals who work in this industry and 1S also 
responsible for 80% of Maine’s annual timber harvest 
Thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify on behalf of our membership in general 
support of LD 1648 — An Act To Make Changes to the Farm and Open Space Tax Law We are in 
agreement with most of the changes that the sponsor has recommended, but before this bill goes 
forward, we would like to see a few revisions made to align the bill with the recommendations of 
the Governor ’s Forest Carbon Task Force to ensure consistency 
As a member of the Governor ’s Task Force on the Creation of a Forest Carbon Program, which 
was created by Executive Order in January 2021 and submitted its ﬁnal report on October 21, 
2021, the taskforce discussed and made recommendations for changes to the Farm and Open 
Space Current Use Taxation Program as a pathway to increasing carbon sequestration in 
Maine’s forests I have attached the recommendations speciﬁc to the Open Space Current Use 
Taxation Program to my testimony 
I would like to highlight a couple of areas of concern that should be amended before this bill 
goes forward 
First, 1I1 Section 1106-B, there is a recommendation for a 25% reduction in the open space 
valuation if a property is “permanently protected ” It is not clear what “permanently protected ” 
means as there is no deﬁnition of “permanently protected ” in the bill Our recommendation
would be to amend the b1ll to lncluded “ecolog1cal reserves as permanently protected ” and keep 
the dlscount at 20% 
Second, the Forest Carbon Task Force recommended a 20% dlscount for Sect1on 1106-C andD 
However, the b1l1 language calls for a 25% reductlon We beheve that the two should allgn and 
25% 1s too aggresslve 
Lastly, as you W111 note 1n the recommendatlons of the Task Force, for landowners W1th a carbon 
conservanon management plan, there 1s dlfferentlatlon between forest and non-forested land 
Forested land also needed to be 70% forested As wntten, the b1ll does not dlfferentlate between 
forested and non-forested land and there 1s no requlrement for a mlmmum percentage of 
forested property Our recommendatlon would be to lnclude the recommendatlons of our Task 
Force 1n the b1ll to ensure conslstency from a broad stakeholder group 
Thank you for the opportunlty to speak before you today and I look forward to answermg any 
questlons you may have

Governor ’s Task Force 
on the 
Creation of a Forest Carbon Program 
Final Report 
October 29, 2021
6. Recommend updates to the Open Space Current Use Taxation program including ina 
manner that incentivizes climate-friendly land management practices 
The recommendations in this section represent the aspirations of the Task Force, which 
acknowledges that further dialogue with municipalities and other interests will be required 
to ﬁnalize a legislative approach 
Task Force members have prepared initial concepts for revision of the Open Space Current Use 
Lg program, and gathered initial feedback from representatives of Maine Revenue Services and 
the Maine Municipal Association It then sought broader feedback on a draft during the public 
comment period This section is not an attempt to provide complete or ﬁnal language for update 
and revision of the program, but instead focuses on key program elements 
Priorigg Concepts 
The Open Space program should be streamlmed, with an added emphasis on climate beneﬁt 
The Open Space program should contribute to maintaining forestland and reducing 
forestland loss in the state It 1S an important but underutilized option among Maine’s 
current use tax programs 
The Open Space Program should be made more efﬁcient to increase value to the public, 
attract more landowner participation, and be easier to administer by municipalities, with 
reduced ﬁnancial burden 
The Open Space program should accommodate a wide range of potential land 
management practices, from intensive silviculture and production of forest products to 
development of old forest and maximizing carbon storage 
The Open Space program should not create a ﬁscal burden for municipal budgets and will 
require state reimbursement (noting complexity in that municipalities may beneﬁt from 
reduced costs of providing services when lands remain undeveloped and from mcreased 
revenue sharing as a result of reduced valuation) 
Potential Program Revisions 
A Provide state reimbursement to municipalities to reduce ﬁnancial burden on mumcipalities, 
in acknowledgement of the broad public beneﬁt of maintaining undeveloped lands 
(Reimbursement could be based on the same formula used for state reimbursement under the 
Tree Growth Current Use Tax program or could use the tax rates for undeveloped acreage used 
by individual municipalities ) 
B Revise Open Space Program valuation reductions to 
Increase the discount for “Ordinary ” Open Space (which precludes development) in 
order to encourage greater participation in the Open Space program and emphasize its core
21
value of helpmg to keep land undeveloped (The Task Force recommended an mcrease to 
50% from the current 20%)' 
Mamtam the current drscount of 25% for Publrc Access 
Create two new categorres 
Wrldhfe Habrtat Management Consrder a 20% drscount for rmplementatron of a wrldhfe 
enhancement practlce (Practlces to be approved by the Mame Department of Inland 
Frsherles and Wlldhfe 1n ahgmnent wrth the State Wrldhfe Actlon Plan or wrth mapped 
Begmnmg w1th Habrtat features, w1th landowner attestatron of practrce rmplementatlon)
E Carbon Management C0l1Sld6l' a 20% drscount, wrth ehgrbllrty based on the followmg 
concepts 
Forested land (propertres wlth 10 or more forested acres and greater than 70% forested) 
may qualrfy wrth any of the followmg optrons Any qualrfymg property would 
automatrcally be consrdered to provrde a pubhc beneﬁt and be ehglble for enrollment m the 
Open Space program 
Adoptron of a 10-year forest management plan slgned by a llC6I‘lS6(l forester that 
mcludes strategres to mcrease forest carbon and conslders carbon stored 1n forest 
products (Thrs 1s essentlally the same requrrement for the Tree Growth current use 
program elrgrbrllty, but the plan here can prlorrtrze forest carbon) 
Implementatron of a forest carbon practrce approved by the Mame Forest Servlce, 
quahfyrng for the Carbon Management reductlon for 10 years, wrth landowner 
attestatron of practlce rmplementatron (Thrs optron 1s mtended to facrhtate greater 
partrcrpatron by owners of smaller propertles) 
Propertres wrth permanent ecologlcal reserve restrrctrons shall qualrfy for the carbon 
management dlscount (The recommended 20% drscount 1s the same dlscount 
avarlable 1n the current program, and ecologrcal reserves have demonstrated beneﬁts 
for carbon storage ) 
Non-forested land (propertles not qualrfyrng as Forested Land, above) may qualrfy for 10 
years based on rmplementatlon of carbon management practrces approved by the Mame 
Department of Agrlculture, Conservatlon, & Forestry, wrth landowner attestatlon of 
practrce lmplementatron (Owners of non-forested lands may also have the optron to 1) 
choose the wlldlrfe habrtat management optron, or 2) 1f elrgrble, partrclpate 1n the Farmland 
Current Use program ) 
Mamtam the current maxrmum drscount of 95% (note that for forested acres, the current 
program l1m1ts the reductron to be no greater than that avarlable through the Tree Growth 
Current Use program)
22
\ 
C Streamllne program to rely on % reductrons and elrmmate the alternatrve approach of 
rndrvldual drscretlonary assessment based on assumed lmpacts of enrollment on valuatron (Tlns 
1s rntended to provrde greater clarlty and certarnty for landowners mterested 1n enrollrng 1n the 
program, and to reduce complexrty for assessors and mumcrpalrtles ) 
D Allow any landowner to transfer the1r property from Tree Growth to Open Space wrthout 
penalty for propertres 1n Tree Growth pnor to 2021
