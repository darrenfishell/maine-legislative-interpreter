Testimony of Rep. Jtm Boyle presenting 
LD 1648, An Act to Make Changes to the Farm and Open Space Tax Law 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Senator Grohoskr, Representat1ve Perry and d1st1ngu1shed members of the J omt Standmg 
Commlttee on Taxatlon, my name 1s J1m Boyle and I represent House D1str1ct 109, WI’l1CI1 1s the 
eastern half of Gorham I am here today to present LD 1648, An Act to Make Changes to the 
Farm and Open Space Tax Law. 
Over the last several months I worked closely w1th a vanety of stakeholders to craft tlus b1ll You 
W111 not1ce that both the t1tle and the b1ll draft 1nclude reference to the Farmland current use 
program — I worked w1th Representatrve Zelgler to mclude h1s suggested changes to the 
Farmland program I hope you W111 dlrect any questlons relatmg to that program to h1m or 
perhaps other 0rgan1zat1ons behmd me 
As you may know, I am a proud graduate of the Umvers1ty of Ma1ne forestry program and 
worked extenslvely as a forester 1n the North Mame Woods before sh1ft1ng 1nto envnomnental 
consultmg As a forester and wetland sc1ent1st, I care deeply about land conservatlon and support 
efforts to manage our natural resources to beneﬁt both forest and w1ldl1fe health and Ma1ne’s 
forest economy I bel1eve LD 1648 and the proposed changes to the Open Space Tax Program 
w1ll strengthen and modermze th1s 1mportant tool 
LD 1648 adjusts the valuatlon method for the Open Space Tax Law to brmg 1t mto allgmnent 
w1th the more frequently used Mame Tree Growth Tax Program Th1s adjustment alone W111 help 
landowners and mumc1pal1t1es to better understand and 1mplement the program 
In add1t1on to adjustmg the valuatlon method, my b11l serves to clean up and modermze the 
valuatlon categones Current law mcludes vague and somewhat redundant valuat1on categones 
that aren’t reﬂectlve of current management needs and trends Tlus b1ll updates the cr1ter1a ﬂ1at 
was developed 1n the late 1980s to focus on pr1or1t1es that serve Ma1ne’s forest management, 
w1ld11fe and clnnate goals publlc access, w1ldl1fe habltat management, carbon forest 
management and permanent protectlon These new categones are more clearly deﬁned and 
requ1re management plans to ensure accountab1l1ty and compllance, WI11CI'l strengthens the 
program and supports mumc1pal1t1es 
D1str1ct 109 Gorham (part)
LD 1648 also addresses the 1ssue of mumclpal rermbursement Currently there 1s not requlrement 
for mtmlcrpal relmbursement for revenue lost as a result of be1ng enrolled under the Farm or 
Open Space Current Use programs The Ma1ne Tree Growth Tax Law requlres munlcrpal 
rermbursement, and we know that munrcrpahtres have long been concerned about the lack of 
parlty for these other programs Thls b1ll requrres the State Tax Assessor to rermburse 
mumc1pal1t1es 1n a manner s1m1lar to the method of relmbursement under the Mame Tree Growth 
Tax Law , 
Thank you for the opportumty to present my b11l I’m happy to answer any questlons, but I know 
many of the folks who helped draft th1s b1ll are behmd me and they mrght be best surted to 
answer any detarled or specrﬁc questrons
