RE: LD 1648 - An Act to Make Changes to the Farm and Open Space Tax Law 
Senator Grohosk|, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Taxation, my name is Kaitlyn Nuzzo and l am the Government Relations Director for 
The Nature Conservancy in Maine I appreciate this opportunity to testify in support 
of LD 1648, An Act to Make Changes to the Farm and Open Space Tax Law. We want 
to especially thank Representative Boyle for working with us to bring this bill forward 
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) IS a nonprofit conservation organization dedicated to 
conserving the lands and waters on which all life depends Guided by science, we 
create innovative, on—the-ground solutions to our world's toughest challenges so that 
nature and people can thrive together We use a collaborative approach that engages 
local communities, governments, the private sector, and other partners The Nature 
Conservancy has been leading conservation in Maine for more than 60 years and is the 
12th largest landowner in the state, owning and managing roughly 300,000 acres We 
also work across Maine to restore rivers and streams, partner with fishermen in the 
Gulf of Maine to rebuild groundfish populations, and develop innovative solutions to 
address ourichanging climate 
Our organization worked closely with the bill sponsor and a variety of partner 
organizations to draft this bill Our goal from the outset was to incorporate 
recommendations from the Forest Carbon Task Force The Task Force was 
recommended by Maine's four—year climate action plan, Maine Won't Wait, and 
created by Executive Order by Governor l\/l|llS in January 2021 The Task Force set out 
to explore issues related to carbon storage for small—to—medium size woodland 
owners The Task Force met regularly for 10 months, solicited public input along the 
way, and ultimately resulted in a consensus report containing recommendations to 
enhance the ways in which Maine's forests Wlll continue to contribute toward < 
achieving our climate goals My colleague Mark Berry, TNC Maine's Forest Program 
Director, served as a member of the Task Force and worked specifically with a subset 
of the group to shape the recomri endations related to the Open Space Current Use 
Taxation program 
LD 1648 seeks to build Qn the work of the Task Force by incorporating the suggested 
program revisions into law Priority concepts that were considered by the Task Force 
included i 
- Streamlining the program with an added emphasis on climate benefit 
- Supporting the program's ability to contribute to maintaining forestland and 
reducing forestland loss in Maine 
- Increasing program efficiency by making it easier to administer by municipalities 
- Accommodate a wide range of potential land management practices — from 
harvesting for forest products to managing for different forest types or carbon 
storage

— 
Ensuring the program does not create a ﬁscal burden for municipal budgets by 
requiring state reimbursement 
LD 1648 addresses each of these c0ncepts ’and we believe it would make important and 
necessary changes 
It is worth noting that while the bill before you appears to be complex and the 
summary states that it establishes a "new method of the valuation of land under the 
farm and open space tax law” , the actual concept not new and quite simple Currently 
the Open Space Tax Law operates under a structure tl at is quite different from the 
more commonly known and utilized Maine Tree Growth Tax Law This bill would 
change the Open Space Tax Law program to conform to the simpler model used with 
Tree Growth, making it easier for landowners, municipalities, and the state to 
implement L 
Each year, the State Tax Assessor determines the Tree Growth rates broken out by 
county and forest type, then distributes those rates to municipalities so they can 
implement the Tree Growth Program LD 1648 uses those same annual values to 
calculate a maximum Open Space value brokenput by county as the starting point, 
then outlines a more streamlined set of criteria to further reduce the valuation 
Landowners can then choose any two of the following four management options to 
further reduce their valuation allowing public access, managing for wildlife habitat, 
managing for forest carbon sequestration, or opting for permanent protection The bill 
“outlines criteria for each of these categories and requires consultation with state 
agencies and management plans to ensure accountability to these priorities
L 
TNC strongly supports Maine's current use tax programs and utilizes both the,Open 
Space Tax Program and the Maine Tree Growth Tax Program We appreciate this 
opportunity to refresh the Open Space Tax Program to make it simpler and better able 
to accommodate current land management trends an i values around forest carbon 
We urge the committee to support LD 1648, and we are happy to answer questions 
now or at any point in the future Thank you for the opportunity to comment
