Biomarker testing saves lives and helps people live in less pain. Precision medicine is 
key when treating certain conditions like cancer or autoimmune types of arthritis. To 
give patients that best options for treatment, medicine needs to be tailored for their 
specific genes, proteins, and other substances in their body. That's why biomarker 
testing is so important because they can detemine what is the best treatment for a 
patient. 
Many doctors who treat arthritis patients report that insurance coverage for biomarker
testing is a barrier. Providers are fighting with insurance companies so that patients 
have access to biomarker testing because access to testing means a more prescise way
of treating the disease which could be lifesaving. We can improve the quality of life 
of many people in Maine by expanding appropriate coverage of biomarker testing for 
private and public insurance plans. We need to ensure patients will get the right care 
that they need at the right time.  For these reasons I respectfully request that you 
support LD 1577.
