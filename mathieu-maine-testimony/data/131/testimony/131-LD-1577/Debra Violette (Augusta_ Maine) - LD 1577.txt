                                    May 8, 2023 My name is Deb Viole4e and I am in support of LD-1577  “An Act to Require Health Insurance Coverage for Biomarker TesNng.” Thank you Senator Bailey, RepresentaNve Perry, disNnguished members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Commi4ee for allowing me to speak today.  I would also like to thank sponsors RepresentaNve Zager, Senator Benne4, RepresentaNve Arata, Cyrway, Javner, Perry, Swallow, and Bailey. I am President and founder of Free ME from Lung Caner, the only nonproﬁt based here in Maine dedicate solely to raising much needed money for research, early lung cancer screening and helping single family low income homeowners get access to radon air abatement systems.  I am here today to tesNfy in support of LD-1577. I am not a professional lobbyist, although I have done my share of lobbying on issues near to me.  I am a lung cancer paNent/survivor. I was diagnosed with stage III disease in 1998.  I visit my Boston oncologist who monitors my condiNon and are ready to treat the disease should it progress.  25 years ago biomarker tesNng was not something that was available to cancer pa-Nents. Biomarker tesNng is a way to look for genes, proteins and other substances “called biomarkers or tumor markers” that can provide informaNon about the tumor.  Just as we are all unique so isn't our biomarkers. Some of these biomarkers aﬀect how certain cancer treatments will work.  It helps the paNent and physician select a cancer treatment designed just for the paNent.  Some treatments including targeted therapies and immunotherapies may only work for people whose cancers have certain biomarkers. This is a game changer for paNents because once their bio-markers have been idenNﬁed a treatment plan can be developed that would best ﬁt the paNent.   It can also provide evidence about the safety and eﬃcacy of the chosen treatments. Biomarker tesNng is an important part of precision medicine, also called personalized medicine. Precision medicine is an approach to medical care in which disease prevenNon, diagnosis, and treatment are tailored to the genes, proteins and other substances in the paNent’s body. Bio-marker tesNng can also help you ﬁnd a study of a new cancer treatment “clinical trial” that the paNent may be able to join.  For some other clinical trails, biomarker tesNng is part of the study.  

For example studies NCI-MATCH and NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH are using biomarker tests to match people to treatments  based on the geneNc change their cancer.  Biomarker tesNng results could also show that the paNents cancer has a biomarker that may prevent a certain therapy form work.  This informaNon would spare the paNent from geeng a treatment that won’t help the paNent. Above test taken directly form the NaNonal Cancer InsNtutes website at h4ps://www.cancer.-gov/about-cancer/treatment/tyes/biomarker-tesNng-cancer-treatment  I am asking that you all support this important piece of legislaNon.  It will increase the standard of paNent care and ensure that the treatment plan chosen is the right treatment for the paNent.  Deb Viole4e, President Free ME from Lung Cancer
