RE: LD 1577, Require Health Insurance Coverage for Biomarker  Testing  – SUPPORT  
 
Chair  Bailey , Chair Perry , and members of the joint committee : 
On behalf of all the people we serve in Ma ine, including the 2,097 residents currently living with End -Stage -Renal Disease (ESRD) 
we respectfully request your support for Legislative Document 1577 (LD 1577) . This important bill w ill ensure that patients across 
the state have access to biomarker testing for the purposes of diagnoses and courses of treatment .   
The American Kidney Fund (AKF) is the nation’s leading nonprofit organizations working  on behalf of the 37 million Americans 
living with kidney disease, and the millions more at risk, with an unmatched scope of programs that support people wherever t hey 
are in their fight against kidney disease, from prevention through transplant. With prog rams that address early detection, disease 
management, financial assistance, clinical research, innovation and advocacy, no kidney organization impacts more lives than AKF.  
We are also one of the nation’s top -rated nonprofits, investing 97 cents of every donated dollar in programs, AKF has also 
received the highest 4- Star rating from Charity Navigator  for 19 consecutive years, as well as the Platinum Seal of Transparency 
from Guidestar.  
Insurance plans do not consistently cover the cost of biomarker testing, which involves analyzing a person’s tissue, blood or  other 
biospecimens to determine the best treatment for them. While frequently used in the field of oncology, kidney disease 
researchers are beginning to identify new biomarkers that could change the way doctors treat kidney disease.  
One of the American Kidney Fund’s top priorities is to advocate for health equity —and we believe that healthcare access and 
affordability are critical components. Action to expand coverage of promising medical testing, including biomarker testing, can 
help patients and providers in determining the most effective courses of treatment.  
We believe that removing barriers to biomarker testing will ensure that all patients —regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age, 
socioeconomic status or zip code —will benef it from better care. Expanded access to biomarker testing is sound public policy for 
the state of Maine, which is why we respectfully request your support for LD 1577. 
 
Thank you again for your time and for your careful consideration of this important issue .  If you have any questions, please feel 
free to contact me directly at any time. 
 
Sincerely,
