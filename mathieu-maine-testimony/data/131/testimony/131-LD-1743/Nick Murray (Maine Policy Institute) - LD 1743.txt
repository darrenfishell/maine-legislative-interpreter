Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1743,
“An
Act
to
Eliminate
the
Personal
Property
Tax.”
Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1743
.
Why
should
Mainers
have
to
pay
an
annual
tax
on
a
piece
of
property,
simply
because
they
have
owned
it
for
another
year?
In
even
the
most
generous
state
rankings
on
economic
health
and
competitiveness,
Maine
places
in
the
bottom
10.
1
The
cost
of
doing
business
here
is
9%
higher
than
the
national
average;
the
cost
of
living
is
15%
higher.
2
Our
tax
burden
is
the
third-highest
in
the
nation.
3
Taxes
and
fees
are
big
contributors
to
these
dubious
statistics.
We
pay
the
most
in
property
taxes,
as
a
share
of
personal
income,
than
any
other
state
in
the
nation.
4
You
can
be
a
part
of
the
solution
by
doing
all
that
you
can
to
reduce
the
onerous
tax
burden
on
Mainers.
Please
deem
LD
1743
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
put
an
end
to
the
nickel-and-diming
of
Maine
people
at
a
time
when
their
purchasing
power
is
being
stretched
to
its
limit.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
