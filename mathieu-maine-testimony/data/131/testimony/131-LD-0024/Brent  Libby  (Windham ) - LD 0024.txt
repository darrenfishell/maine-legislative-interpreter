LD 24
Please consider this testimony as my support for LD 24.
The Red Flag warning system has long served our industry to alert firefighters and the
public of an immanent fire threat. While it should be assumed that outside fires during
this time should not occur this LD further clarifies a Red Flag condition and provides 
guidance for prohibition of dangerous acts that could result in significant catastrophe. 
For the Regulation of Recreational Campfires this again provides much needed clarity
for citizens and firefighters. Locally we have adopted a similar definition as result of 
constant neighbor disputes and concerns for what is and what is not a recreational fire.
Further, what does and does not require an outside burning permit. 
I would like to thank the Forest Service and Senator Curry for submitting this 
legislation and to this committee for their anticipated support of these proposed 
amendments as outlined in LD 24.
