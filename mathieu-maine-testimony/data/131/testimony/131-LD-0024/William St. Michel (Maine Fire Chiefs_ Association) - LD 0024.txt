Testimony in Support of LD 24 An Act to Ban Open Fires on Red Flag Days 
and to Define Recreational Fires
Senator Ingwerson, Representative Pluecker and distinguished members of The 
Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. My name 
is William St. Michel, I am the retired Fire Chief of The Town of Durham and 
currently The Executive Director for Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association. Maine Fire 
Chiefs’ Association fully supports LD 24, An Act to Ban Open Fires on Red 
Flag Days and to Define Recreational Fires.
LD 24 removes the legal ability to conduct permitted open burning on Red Flag 
Days that currently exits. Red Flag days seldom occur but are posted when 
conditions for the rapid spread of outside fire are extremely high and dangerous. 
Removing the ability to conduct permitted open burning on Red Flag Days is in 
the best interest of our environment, citizens and first responders.
The current definition of a recreational campfire makes it difficult to define and 
provides no clear separation between a campfire and a bonfire. A recreational 
campfire used for it’s defined use does not require a permit when on the 
individuals’ property whereas as a bonfire always requires a permit. The changes 
to the definition listed in LD 24 will create a clear separation and definition.
Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association would like to request your support in moving 
this important piece of Legislation, LD 24 forward. Thank you for your time.
