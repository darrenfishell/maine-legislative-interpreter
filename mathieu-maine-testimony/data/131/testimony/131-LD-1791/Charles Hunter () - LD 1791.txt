LD 1791
I would like to provide opposing testimony on bill LD 1791.  The St. Lawrence & 
Atlantic RR (SLR) which operates freight railroad interstate services across Maine 
has a well established real estate department and process to handle all utility permit 
requests.  Rates and fees are set to fairly compensate the privately owned railroad for 
their services and use of it's property. Railroads are federally regulated and must 
comply with many safety standards and procedures when allowing installation of 
utility infrastructure on the right of way.  Introducing state rules on these procedures 
is burdensome and unnecessary.  The SLR is very aware of the importance of 
broadband expansion efforts and wants to support them wherever possible. If there are
individual situations where there may be an issue with a utility permit (which I am 
currently unaware), we are open to working through any issues to move projects 
forward. I am also providing some relevant information from the Association of 
American Railroads.  Should the committee need further information or have 
questions, please contact me.  Respectfully, Charles Hunter, Assistant VP of 
Government Affairs, Genesee & Wyoming RR Services, Inc.
