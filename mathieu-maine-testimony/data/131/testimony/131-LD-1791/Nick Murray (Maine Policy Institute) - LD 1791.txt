Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1791:
“An
Act
to
Make
the
ConnectMaine
Authority
Responsible
for
Attachments
to
and
Joint
Use
of
Utility
Poles
and
to
Establish
Procedures
for
Broadband
Service
Infrastructure
Crossing
Railroad
Tracks”
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities,
and
Technology,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1791.
LD
1791
would
allow
the
Maine
Connectivity
Authority
(MCA)
to
usurp
the
power
that
the
Public
Utilities
Commission
(PUC)
currently
has
today
to
govern
the
joint
use
of
utility
poles,
including
the
power
to
set
fees.
Private
ISPs
currently
negotiate
pole
use
fees
with
the
PUC,
a
neutral
arbiter.
The
problem
is,
MCA
effectively
competes
with
private
ISPs
by
giving
grants
to
municipalities
to
build
parallel
networks
to
already-existing
private
networks—along
the
same
poles.
The
Maine
Connectivity
Authority’s
entire
existence
has
been
in
conflict
with
existing
private-sector
ISPs.
To
allow
this
organization
to
govern
utility
poles
is
akin
to
letting
the
fox
guard
the
hen
house.
MCA
could
use
these
new
powers
to
punish
projects
they
don’t
like
by
raising
the
costs
to
use
poles
shared
by
private
ISPs
in
certain
towns.
This
would
allow
them
to
tip
the
scales
in
favor
of
projects
which
use
tax
dollars,
versus
private
projects
which
do
not.
This
urge
is
existential
to
MCA,
but
giving
it
powers
reserved
for
public
utility
regulators
would
be
completely
reckless.
It
is
simply
inappropriate
to
delegate
this
power,
one
that
is
unique
to
utility
regulation,
and
one
which
may
cause
significant
economic
effects
away
from
the
office
traditionally
designed
to
have
it.
Do
the
sponsors
have
any
legitimate
case
to
make
for
stripping
these
powers
from
the
PUC?
To
MCA,
there
is
no
internet
solution
if
it
is
not
publicly-owned
and
funded.
This
narrow-minded
view
of
internet
delivery
service
options
has
contributed
to
immense
waste
at
the
local
level.
LD
1791
would
give
this
group
powers
even
greater
than
what
it
wields
today,
and
in
a
less-constitutionally
proper
role.
It
would
expose
the
joint
use
of
poles
to
political
pressures
of
the
MCA,
who
regularly
steamroll
private
ISPs
and
concerned
community
members
in
their
attempts
to
overbuild
wasteful
and
duplicative
government-owned
broadband
networks.

Please
deem
LD
1791
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
protect
utility
regulation
from
political
ideologues
at
the
Maine
Connectivity
Authority.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
