Testimony in Support of LD 119, “An Act to Clarify the Boundary Between 
Waldo and Knox Counties in Penobscot Bay”
Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government
January 31, 2023
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on State and Local Government, I am Senator Chip Curry, and I represent the 26 rural, coastal, and 
island communities of Waldo County. Today, I am pleased to present LD 119, “An Act to Clarify the 
Boundary Between Waldo and Knox Counties in Penobscot Bay.” This bill is a product of the hard 
work of many stakeholders, including the Waldo and Knox County Commissioners.
LD 119 is necessary to address a discrepancy between recent maps and the legislative history of the 
boundary line between Waldo and Knox counties. This clarification is supported by the communities 
and has already been voted on and approved by both the Waldo County commissioners and Knox 
County commissioners.
This bill is a simple, straightforward solution to a long-standing discrepancy in the county maps. I 
strongly encourage the committee to support this bill and implement the boundary line that has the 
approval of the local communities.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m happy to answer any questions you may have.
Sincerely,
Chip Curry
Senator, District 11
