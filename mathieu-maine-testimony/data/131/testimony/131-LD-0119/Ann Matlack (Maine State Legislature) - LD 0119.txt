_ Testimony of Rep. Ann Matlack in support of 
LD 119, An Act to Clarify the Boundary Between Waldo and Knox 
Counties in Penobscot Bay 
Before the State and Local Government Committee 
Good afternoon, Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and respected colleagues on the State& 
Local Govermnent Committee. My name is Ann Matlack and I am here today to testify in support 
of LD 119, An Act to Clarify the Boundary Between Waldo and Knox Counties in Penobscot 
Bay. I represent House District 43, which includes the communities of Cushing, Thomaston, South 
Thomaston, St George and part of Owls Head, all of which are within Knox County. 
Senator Curry introduced this bill last session. He and I agreed to work with both Knox County 
and Waldo County to resolve the issue of the boundary of the 2 counties in Penobscot Bay. GIS 
personnel from both Knox and Waldo counties and the Maine State Land Use Planning 
Commission crafted a GIS map that shows the new permanent boundary that is equitable and 
resolves the issues brought up by planners in Waldo County. Last spring, both the Knox and Waldo 
boards of county commissioners Ô¨Ånalized the map developed by the GIS professionals. The 
language in this bill states in words what the map physically shows. I believe the County 
Administrator from Knox County will present the map to the committee. 
I am happy to support this effort by both counties to resolve a long-standing issue by working 
together to craft a new boundary line. 
Thank you for your time, and I would be happy to answer any questions. 
District 43 Cushing, South Thomaston, St. George, Thomaston and part of Owls Head
