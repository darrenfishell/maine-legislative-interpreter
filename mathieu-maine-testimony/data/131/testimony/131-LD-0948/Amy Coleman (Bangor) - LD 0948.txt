Dear Members of the Committee,
I am writing to express my strong support for the bill that allows other children to 
attend a preschool program or medical-based preschool program paid for by the 
Department of Education. As a parent of a preschool-aged child, I have seen firsthand
the tremendous benefits that preschool programs provide, both academically and 
socially.
My child has attended a high-quality preschool program for the past 2 years, and the 
progress she has made is truly remarkable. She has developed a love of learning, and 
her social skills have improved dramatically. She has learned to share, take turns, and 
work collaboratively with others - skills that will serve her well throughout her life.
Unfortunately, not all families have the same opportunities as mine. Many families 
cannot afford to send their children to preschool, and as a result, their children start 
kindergarten at a disadvantage. This is particularly true for families with medical 
needs, as the cost of medical-based preschool programs can be prohibitive.
By providing department of education funding for preschool programs, we can ensure
that all children have access to high-quality early education. This is not only the right 
thing to do from a social justice perspective, but it is also a smart investment in our 
future. Studies have shown that children who attend high-quality preschool programs 
are more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and earn higher salaries 
as adults.
I urge you to support this bill, which will help to level the playing field for all 
children and give them the opportunity to succeed. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Amy Coleman
