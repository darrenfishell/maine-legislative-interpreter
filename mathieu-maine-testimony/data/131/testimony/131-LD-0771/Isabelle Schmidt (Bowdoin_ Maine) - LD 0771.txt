LD 771
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Isabelle Schmidt, from Bowdoin. 
I am writing to speak in support of LD 771, “An Act to Protect a Woman's Right to 
Withdraw Consent for an Abortion”.
Imagine you’ve conceded to have your child aborted and then, once you’ve been 
readied for the procedure, you have a sudden change of heart.  Now imagine you do 
not have the right to stop your abortion before it starts, because of something you’ve 
signed or an associated expenditure already made in preparation, etc.  This right ought
to be stipulated by law, as there could be situations in which it is quite inconvenient to
prevent a procedure that has already had effort put in towards its accomplishment.  If 
a mother is not protected against the right to change her mind about killing her own 
unborn child before it has happened, doctors are certainly making murderers of 
themselves, in anyone’s eyes. 
We would agree that anyone would have the right to change their mind about any 
other medical procedure that has not yet actually begun in earnest.  We would also 
agree that a woman or minor female has a right to say “no” to sex at any point.  So, it 
follows that she ought also to have the right to prevent putting an end to her child, 
even at the last minute.  Sometimes clear-thinking and courage come to us when 
life-and-death related stress is at its peak, when there’s just enough time to 
accomplish that heroic act.  Let the woman’s right to choose be legal until the last 
minute.  
What would be the consequence of a fetus being spared an untimely death, even if it 
is as the result of a last-minute change of heart?  As long as it is possible to cease and 
desist with an abortion, it should certainly be legal.  
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 771.  Thank you.
