LD 771 An Act to Protect a Woman's Right to Withdraw Consent for an Abortion 
Support 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee l\/ly name lS Karen Vachon I 
am the Executive Director of Maine Right ‘To Life, in Auburn, and a resident of Scarborough I come before you 
today to speak in Support LD 771 
l\/laine Right to Life lS a state affiliate of the National Right To Life Committee We are a non-profit organization 
founded to protect and uphold the dignity and worth ofevery human life from conception to natural death by 
making abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia socially, ethically, and legally unacceptable and to actively promote 
positive alternatives 
We are Pro-Life, Pro-Active, and Pro—Women Our members share a belief that women were created uniquely to 
fulfill a very important role in mankind Women have a womb They bring new life into the world They are to be 
honored, respected, and protected The word, "reproductive" means to produce an offspring 
A change of heart is life-saving in so many ways l\/lost especially with abortion Not only does it save an unborn's 
beating heart, a change of heart for a woman spares a lifetime of grief, remorse, and regret The ability to change 
course requires courage There is nothing more powerful, though, when you know heart of heart what you must 
do, you take control and you do it The impact spreads far and wide 
Some of the most noted converts who saw the light, changed their minds, and became outspoken supporters of 
human life is Bernard Nathanson and Abbylohnson 
Dr Bernard Nathanson oversaw at least 75,000 abortions between 1970 and 1979, of which, 5,000 he performed 
himself l-le earned the nickname Abortion King By 1973 the advancement of ultrasound technology, helped him 
see abortion for what it lS and the pain the fetus experiences Nathanson became Pro-life Were it not for his 
complete change of heart, we would never know the truth about the deceptive narrative of the abortion industry's 
power, influence, and lies that were cramming abortion down Americans ’ throats 
Abby Johnson, was director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Texas, but not long after assisting in an actual 
abortion procedure for the first time, she had a change of heart and ]OlﬂEd the Coalition for Life 
This past Monday this committee heard testimony from countless women who were considering aborting their 
babies, and had a change of heart They spoke of the many blessings of that decision When your heart says 
change course You should listen 
My hope is that committee members who oppose this legislation and suppoit LD 1619 have a change of heart 
How can saving a human life ever be a bad thing Every single one of us in this room has "life privilege" The ability 
to pass that ”life privilege ” onto an unborn child through a change of heart is the very greatest gift of life Please 
vote ought to pass You will never regret this decision Thank you
