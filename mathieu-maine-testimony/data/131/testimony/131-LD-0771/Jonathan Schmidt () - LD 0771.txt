Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary.  My name is Jon Schmidt, I am a resident of Bowdoin, and I am 
submitting this testimony to express my SUPPORT for LD 771. 
I support LD 771 because its provisions, in combination with several other pro-life bills 
currently under consideration, will help to restore common sense safeguards and necessary 
restraint to Maineâ€™s permissive abortion laws.   
The appropriateness and necessity for the legal changes proposed in this bill are self-
evident.  One can scarcely believe that the need for thoroughly informed consent and the 
right of the woman to withdraw consent and/or halt the abortion procedure at any time 
would ever be questioned or limited. 
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS.. Thank you.
