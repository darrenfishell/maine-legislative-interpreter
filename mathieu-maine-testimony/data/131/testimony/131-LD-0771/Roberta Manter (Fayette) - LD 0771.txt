LD 771
Please vote LD 771 ought to pass.  If a woman realizes during preparations for an 
abortion that she does not want to go through with it, she should have the right to 
change her mind and withdraw consent.  I have heard stories of women who have 
tried to back out of an abortion, but were subjected to that abortion in spite of their 
protests.  Someone testified that there is no reason abortion should be singled out 
from other medical procedures for this sort of legislation.  But I challenge you to find 
any other medical procedure where the patient's decision is a matter of life or death 
for another person.  That is why abortion merits being singled out from all other 
medical procedures.  The woman will have to live with the consequences of her 
decision for the rest of her life.  She should never be denied the right to change her 
mind before it's too late to do so.
