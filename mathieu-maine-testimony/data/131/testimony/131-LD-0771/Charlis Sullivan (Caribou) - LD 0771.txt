Charlis Sullivan
Caribou
LD 771
Senator Eric Brakey and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Charlis Sullivan and I am a resident of Caribou. I am here to 
testify in support of LD 771, SPO330, An Act to Protect a Woman’s Right to 
Withdraw Consent for an Abortion. 
Please help to protect the rights of our Maine women and minor’s allowing them 
liberty to withdraw consent to have an abortion. Abortion is a life-or-death decision 
that is often made under duress and coercion—if a mom changes her mind, this 
proposed legislation will uphold her liberty of choice.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 771 to allow 
freedom and liberty for our Mainers when faced with a life altering decision. Thank 
you.
