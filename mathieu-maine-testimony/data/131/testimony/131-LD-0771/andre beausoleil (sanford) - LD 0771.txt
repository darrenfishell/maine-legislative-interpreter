LD771 
I am writing today in support of LD771 we 
have all been there done something then 
decided that we shouldn’t have. Bought an 
item but we have three days to bring it 
back. Unfortunately the killing of an unborn 
baby can’t be undone three days later. If 
the woman seconds before has an epiphany 
then her wishes at that moment should be 
respected no matter what. We are not 
talking about a washing machine we are 
talking about a human life.  
I strongly urge you to vote ought to pass on
