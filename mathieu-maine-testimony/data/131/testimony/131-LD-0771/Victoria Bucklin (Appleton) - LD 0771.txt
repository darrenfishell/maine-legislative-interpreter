Victoria Bucklin
Appleton
LD 771
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary; my name is Victoria Bucklin and Iâ€™m a resident of 
Appleton. I am writing in support of LD 771. 
Many women seek an abortion because they are afraid, under great duress, and do not 
know about other options. However, miracles do happen. I have a friend who is the 
survivor of a botched abortion. She is smart, industrious, and one of the kindest 
people I know. The world would be a much sadder place without her smile and the 
care she gives to others. LD 771 protects the life of those who have no voice. Let us 
be a state know for protecting the innocent lives of the unborn.
