LD 771
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Janet LeBlanc and I am a resident of 
Waterville. I am  testifying in support of LD 771, SP0330 An Act to Protect a 
Woman's Right to Withdraw Consent for an Abortion
Pregnant women  and pregnant minors at times may feel pressured into having an 
abortion.  They at times may give consent under direst. We need to protect pregnant 
women and pregnant minors from having an abortion performed against their will.   
Pregnant women and pregnant minors should always have the right to change her 
mind about abortion.  There should be criminal consequences for those who perform 
abortions after consent is withdrawn.
