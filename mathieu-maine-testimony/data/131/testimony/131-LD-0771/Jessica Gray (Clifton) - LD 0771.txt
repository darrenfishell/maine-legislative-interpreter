Good morning! I would like to make known my opinion on the subject of withholding
allow a woman to withdraw her consent to abort her baby. I believe all live is precious
and the unborn is vulnerable and in need of our protection. If a mother has changed to
mind and decides to allow her baby to have the right to live, she should have the right 
to withdraw her consent for an abortion at anytime. Thank you
