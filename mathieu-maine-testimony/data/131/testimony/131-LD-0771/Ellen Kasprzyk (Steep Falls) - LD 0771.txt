Women are often put in very difficult situations when they have an unplanned 
pregnancy.  Either the unborn's father, the mother's parents or the culture they live in 
may produce a crescendo of tears, fears and threats pushing the mother toward 
something she may not actually want.  Being inside an abortion facility may not be 
her idea and if she does not wish to follow through with her apparent decision, she 
Must be able to change her mind and refuse services when so much is at stake and 
100% irreversible.
