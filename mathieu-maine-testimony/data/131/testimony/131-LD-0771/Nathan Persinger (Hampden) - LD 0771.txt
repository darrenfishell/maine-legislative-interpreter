LD 771
Dear Judiciary Committee Members,
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 771. A woman, in particular minors, must be 
given every opportunity to withdraw consent to an abortion. A woman should not feel
coerced into going through with an abortion for which she has provided prior consent.
The lives of innocent children must be protected. This is a lethal decision that the 
child has no power to influence, every opportunity must be given for the mother to 
withdraw consent.
