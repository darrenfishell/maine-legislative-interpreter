Senator Carney, Representauve Moonen, and Members of the Jud1c1a1y Commrttee, I 
am Rey Dubo1s, from Bangor, and I am speak1ng m favor of LDs 494, 771, 1197, 1249, 
and 1614 
I base my presentatron on what 1s FAIR and What 1s MORAL 
The Hyde Amendment l1m1ts Med1ca1d re1mbursement for some abort1on costs, and 1t 1s 
entrrely fa1r that the Hyde Amendment be enforced 1n Mame, l1ke 1t 1s m most other 
states Tax payers should not be forced to pay for the electrve procedures that are 
abortron, when they profoundly d1sagree w1th abortron, the k1llmg of a pre-bom ch1ld 
Our elderly , mtellectually drsabled, and homeless people need those tax dollars more 
than the 98% of women who become pregnant through then own behavrors We 
taxpayers should not have to pay for the consequence of a man and a woman's 
consensual act that results m an unplanned pregnancy It's trme for them to pay for the 
result of then own dec1s1ons 
An Act to Protect a Woman's Rrght to Wrthdraw Consent for an Abortron makes so much 
sense, that I'm even surpnsed to see that th1s leg1slat1on must be requ1red as a law Don't 
we all agree that "NO" means "N01" Shouldn't you be allowed to change your mrnd, 
save a baby's hfe, and have your dec1s1on respected Pass LD 771 w1thout any hagghng 
It makes so much sense 
LD 1197 1s smnlarly so stra1ght forward that 1t should pass w1tl1out res1stance It 1s Just 
so FAIR that a woman should not be coerced mto k1ll1ng her ch1ld Aren't people always 
grven appropr1ate mformat1on/ educatron re electrve procedures 
LD 1249 restnct a Physlcran from prescnbmg abortlon through telehealth Wouldn't you 
thmk that an eth1cal med1cal pract1t1oner would want to do an actual face to face 
physrcal exam of a pregnant lady before domg somethmg so drastrc as 1Cl1ll161' ch1ld To 
abort a baby w1thout knowmg the correct fetal age, placenta locatron, or potent1al 
presence of ectop1c pregnancy seem tantamotmt to malpractrce Isn't the health and 
safety of the mother supposed to be so 1mportant â€˜? LD 1249 certarnly protects the health 
and safety of the mother more than ANY of the b1lls drscussed m hearmgs on Monday 
LD 1614 requlres that an ultrasound be completed and counselmg be provrded 
Appropr1ate d1agnost1cs and full d1scuss1on of safety and optrons seems hlce somethmg a 
respectable practrtroner would provrde 
All of us testrfymg today are gomg to tell you these brlls ought to pass, and I recommend 
that you vote "Ought to pass" , but not Just because they m1ght result m fewer bab1es 
bemg lulled Pass these b1lls because they'll result m the mothers bemg treated more 
safely and professronally, and the med1cal prov1ders w1ll practrce the1r trade 1n a more 
professlonal manner
