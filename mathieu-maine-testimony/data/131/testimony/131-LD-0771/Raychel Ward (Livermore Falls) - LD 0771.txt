Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen
and
Honorable
Members
of
the
joint
standing
committee
on
judiciary,
Hello
my
name
is
Raychel
Ward
and
I
am
from
Livermore
falls,
I
again
want
to
thank
you
for
being
here
today.
I
know
the
topics
you
have
heard
this
week
are
heavy
to
say
the
least
and
I
personally
want
to
thank
you
for
hearing
us
the
people
of
Maine.
I
am
here
in
support
of
LD771.
I
would
further
add
if
the
option
exists
that
healthcare
providers
shall
avoid
the
use
of
drugs
that
may
cloud
a
womens
judgment
until
the
abortion
is
completed.
I
say
this
because
in
the
5
years
of
street
ministry
I
was
involved
in
at
the
Planned
Parenthood
on
Congress
street
in
Portland
to
often
we
saw
women
basically
needing
to
be
carried
out
of
the
clinic
due
to
the
amount
of
medication
given
to
them.
I
also
support
this
bill
because
at
anytime
in
a
hospital
setting
no
matter
the
procedure
you
may
withdraw
consent
at
anytime
prior
to
the
procedure
beginning
why
should
it
be
any
different
in
one
of
these
settings?
I
thank
you
once
again
for
being
here
today
and
considering
our
elevated
voices
in
the
capital.
