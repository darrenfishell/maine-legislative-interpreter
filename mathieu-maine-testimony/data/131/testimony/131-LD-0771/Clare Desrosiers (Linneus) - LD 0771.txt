LD 771, SP0330 An Act to Protect a Woman's Right to Withdraw Consent for an 
Abortion - Sen. Eric Brakey of Androscoggin
Position: Support
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Clare Desrosiers, from Linneus, ME. I am submitting testimony in 
Support of LD 771. 
A woman should always have the right to change her mind about an abortion and if an
abortion is performed after consent has been withdrawn, there must be criminal 
consequences.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 771.
Thank you!
