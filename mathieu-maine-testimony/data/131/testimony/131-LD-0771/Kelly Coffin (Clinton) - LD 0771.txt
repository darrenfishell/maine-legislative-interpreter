Kelly Coffin
Clinton
LD 771
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, My name is Kelly Coffin from 
Clinton  testifying in favor of the passage of LD 771,SP330.I have heard personal 
testimonies of woman actually on the surgical table, feet in stirrups  decide they do 
not want to go through with an abortion only to be told they had to and be bullied by 
nurses and doctors . This is an incredibly difficult and confusing time for a woman 
and they are vulnerable . There is a LOT of money being made from abortion and I 
believe it can taint a professional's judgement for their own gain. This should NEVER
happen. This bill will help empower women and help keep weak professionals from 
possibly being tempted to abuse their power.  I once had a similar experience when I 
was pregnant and was told by medical professionals that I HAD to have a C-section 
and was threatened that insurance would not pay if I didn't and I could not afford to 
pay myself .
