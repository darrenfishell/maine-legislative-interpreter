Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Maine Committee on 
Judiciary I am Wendy Merrill from Benton. 
I am here to testify iii support of LD ll97,Aii Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion 
The State of Maine has a powerful duty to ensure a decision to abort is voluntary, 
without pressure, or coercion. Studies show that up to 60% of women abort 
because of piessure from someone else. (https /itmyuri com/MlCoercionBan) A 
Women pressured to abort is not making this decision for herseli Just last night,a 
woman told me that her husband coerced her into aborting her Last baby by 
threatening to leave her and their living children. She did abort, but here she is 40 
years later, lainentiiig that she caved to that pressure, still mourning the loss of her 
baby, and regretting having that abortion. He ended up leaving her anyway 
In my role as Executive Director of a pregnancy help center, I have walked with 
numerous women through the process of healing after abortion Most of those 
Women felt coerced to abort their baby A piece of health is mental health, Many 
Women suffer from mental health issues after a coerced abortion To ignore this is 
irresponsible and cruel 
Ifwe truly are about W0men & Women’s rights, about a Woman’s right to choose, 
then we must he doing everything We possibly can to ensure women are making 
abortion decisions after they have gathered all the facts, have ample time to 
process them, and are in no way pressured to end the hfe of their baby A woman 
who is coerced is not making her own choice. 
Iurge you to vote ‘YES’ to LD ll97, as well as to LD 494, LD 771, LD l249, LD 
1614, and LD 1809. Thank you
