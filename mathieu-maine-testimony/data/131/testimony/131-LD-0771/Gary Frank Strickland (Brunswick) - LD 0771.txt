Dear Judiciary Committee,
Please support this act to allow a woman to withdraw from an abortion procedure 
prior to the killing of her baby.  This is common sense and protects the ability of the 
woman to consider the error of abortion and choose life.  This should be encouraged 
not only by our elected officials, but for the mother, and for the life of the innocent 
baby.  
Sincerely,
Frank and Sue Strickland
Brunswick, Maine
