 
LD 771  
An Act to Protect a Woman's Right to  
Withdraw Consent for an Abortion  
Presented by Sen. Eric Brakey  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on Judiciary,  
My name is Abigail Beal of Cherryfield, Maine.  Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this 
issue.  
I urge you to SUPPORT LD 771, An Act to Protect a Woman's Right to Withdraw Consent for an 
Abortion.   
It only makes sense that a woman should have the right to change her mind about an 
abortion. And if an abortion is performed after consent has been withdrawn, there must be 
criminal consequences.  
So I ask you to support LD 771. Please protect life by voting, “Ought to Pass”.  Thank you for 
your time.
