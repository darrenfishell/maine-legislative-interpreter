LD 771
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony on LD 771.
I am in favor of this bill.  It makes perfect sense to me that whether it is a pregnant 
woman or a pregnant minor she should have the right to withdraw her consent to have
an abortion any time prior to the death of the fetus.  Whether to abort a baby or not is 
a heart-wrenching decision and there could be many reasons for changing one's mind. 
The first decision might have been made under the coercion of a boyfriend, husband 
or parent leaving the woman without support of any kind.  Since that time, help may 
have been offered making it possible for the woman to keep the baby or even consider
giving it up for adoption
There should definitely be a penalty for anyone who performs or aids in the 
performance of an abortion after consent has been withdrawn.  
Thank you for reading my testimony.  Please support LD 771.
