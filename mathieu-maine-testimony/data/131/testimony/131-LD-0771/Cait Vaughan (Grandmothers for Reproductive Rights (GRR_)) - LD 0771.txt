Senator
Anne
Carney ,
Representative
Matt
Moonen,
and
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
My
name
is
Cait
V aughan
and
I
am
a
staf f
member
with
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!),
an
education
and
advocacy
or ganization
dedicated
to
advancing
reproductive
health,
rights
and
justice
for
present
and
future
generations.
I’m
testifying
on
behalf
of
GRR!
in
opposition
to
LD
771:
An
Act
to
Pr otect
a
W oman's
Right
to
W ithdraw
Consent
for
an
Abortion.
This
bill
is
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem
and
not
based
in
the
realities
of
abortion
care
provision
nor
medical
science.
Abortion
providers
are
trained
in
and
adhere
to
regulated
informed
consent
practices.
When
a
pregnant
patient
comes
to
a
clinic
for
care,
they
are
made
aware
of
their
options.
If
a
patient
demonstrates
uncertainty
or
hesitation
when
they
arrive
to
receive
an
abortion,
clinics
of fer
rescheduling
their
appointment
to
give
them
additional
time
to
consider
their
options
and
refer
the
patient
to
trusted
sources
of
free,
unbiased
and
confidential
counseling.
Abortion
providers
only
want
to
provide
the
care
requested
and
needed
by
patients.
Additionally ,
it
is
unclear
if
this
bill
refers
to
a
debunked
process
called
“abortion
pill
reversal”.
This
is
intentional
misinformation
which
has
been
refuted
by
many
major
medical
associations,
including
the
American
College
of
Obstetricians
and
Gynecologists
(ACOG)
1
.
ACOG
explicitly
states
that
so-called
abortion
pill
reversal
procedures
are
“unproven
and
unethical.”
The
insistence
of
its
existence
by
anti-abortion
advocates
is
intentionally
confusing
and
a
tactic
to
deter
patients
from
medically
accurate
information
and
care
options.
GRR!s
want
pregnant
Mainers
to
feel
supported
and
safe,
and
LD
771
is
insulting
to
pregnant
people.
W e
ur ge
the
committee
to
oppose
LD
771.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration,
Cait
V aughan
&
GRR!s
across
Maine
