LD 771
 I think this Act to Protect a Womans Right to Withdraw Consent for an Abortion is 
very important. A woman may be feeling forced whether by parents, a man, school 
personnel or circumstances in her life. She needs to be given the chance to be free to 
change her mind.

I fully support Ld771.
