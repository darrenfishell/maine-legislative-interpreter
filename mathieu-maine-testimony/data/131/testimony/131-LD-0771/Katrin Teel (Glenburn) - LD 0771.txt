Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary:  
 
I am Katrin Teel of Glenburn, Maine. I am writing to testify in support of L.D. 771, An Act to 
Protect a Woman's Right to Withdraw Consent for an Abortion.  
 
As you know, this bill establishes a pregnant woman's and a pregnant minor's right to withdraw 
consent to an abortion at any time before the death of the fetus. I believe a woman should 
always have the right to change her mind about an abortion and if an abortion is performed after 
consent has been withdrawn, there must be criminal consequences. 
 
Toward that end, I encourage you to vote Ought to Pass on L.D.771. Thank you for allowing me 
to contribute my testimony.
