AND  
An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion  
 Position: Support  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committ ee.  My name is 
Ingrid Duran, I am the State Legislative Director representing the National Right to Life 
Committee .  I come before you to day to speak in s upport  of LD 771 “An Act to Protect a 
Woman's Right to Withdraw Consent for an Abortion ” and LD 1197 “An Act to Prevent Coerced 
Abortion .” 
 
According to a peer  reviewed research article by Vincent Rue, 64% of women often feel 
pressured into having abortions1.  Forms of coercion can look different, from a parent threatening 
to withdraw financial or emotional support to  a partner threatening to leave or worse physically 
harming the pregnant mother.  LD 771 safeguards a woman ’s right to withdraw her consent from 
an abortion.  No woman should ever feel pressured into making such a life -altering decision that 
will lead to the death of her unborn child without  her full informed consent.  LD 771 empowers 
women by informing them that they have every right to change their mind and withdraw consent.  
LD 1197 makes it illegal to coerce a pregnant woman from having an abortion and notifies her of 
her rights as well as giving survivors of do mestic violence information on resources if they are 
being threatened.   
 
This is a common sense law that does not prohibit abortion, and truly seeks to ensure  that women 
know t hey can withdraw consent prior to having the abortion. Failing to protect pregnant women 
is wrong.  Being p ro-choice should also entail a right to say no to abortion.  I ask the committee to 
vote Ought to Pass on LD 771  and LD 1197 .  Thank you!
