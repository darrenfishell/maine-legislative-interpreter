To: The Judiciary Committee 
I am writing to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD771. A woman has the right 
to change her mind about having an abortion performed on her. Do not take this 
right away from her! If someone performs an abortion against her will after she 
withdraws consent, then there should be criminal consequences. 
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD771.
