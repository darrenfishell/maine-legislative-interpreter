LD1197 An act to prevent coerced abor Ɵon 
LD771 An act to protect a woman’s right to withdraw consent f or an abor Ɵon 
 
I am wriƟng today in support of LD1197 & LD771.  It is standard prac Ɵce to provide a pa Ɵent informa Ɵon 
on the rights and risks related to a procedure.  Many women feel pressured to have an abor Ɵon.  What a 
dreadful heart- breaking posi Ɵon to be in.   This legislaƟon helps ensure the woman, young lady, minor, 
knows there are resources available to her should she be in an abusive relaƟonship.  Choosing to end a 
pregnancy is a heavy decision to make.  A person needs to be sure about it.  We are talking about a 
human life here; this small eﬀort , this thin layer of protec Ɵon could prevent a co erced abor Ɵon, could 
prevent life-long regret.  
 
Thank you for your service and a ƩenƟon.  Pleas e vote yes on LD1197 and on LD771.
