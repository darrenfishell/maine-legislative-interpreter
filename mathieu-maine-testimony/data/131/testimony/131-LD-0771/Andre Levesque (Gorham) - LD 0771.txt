                           BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
                                                                           Sponsored by : Sen. Eric Brakey 
                                                                         Public Hearing May 5, 2023 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary. 
My name is Andy Levesque I’m a resident of Gorham, a faithful Catholic, a member of the Knights of 
Columbus, and a board member of Maine Right to Life. 
So we meet again, after Mondays historic show of pro-life Mainers opposing LD1619 which would 
terminate the life of a newborn baby. 
I hope and pray that our sheer numbers will give you affirmation that the majority of Mainer’s do not 
support the Governor’s Bill to kill our newborns. 
Today I support LD494,771,1197,1249,1614 and 1809. 
This bill establishes a pregnant woman's and a pregnant minor's right to withdraw the woman's or the 
minor's consent to an abortion at any time before the death of the fetus. 
 The bill makes performing or aiding in the performance of an abortion after the pregnant woman or 
the pregnant minor has withdrawn consent a Class C crime. 
A woman should always have the right to change her mind about an abortion and if an abortion is 
performed after consent has been withdrawn, there must be criminal consequences. 
I urge you to vote for LD 771, It’s the right thing to do.
