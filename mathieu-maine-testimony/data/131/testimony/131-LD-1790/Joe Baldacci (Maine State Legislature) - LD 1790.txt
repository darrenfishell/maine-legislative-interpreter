Before the J 01nt Standmg Commlttee on Jud1c1ary 
May 10, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and D|st|ngu|shed Members of the Jomt 
Standmg Commlttee on Jud|c|ary I am Senatorloe Baldaccl, and I represent Senate D|str|ct 9, Wl"llCh rs 
made up of Bangor and Hermon l am here today to present LD 1790, ”An Act Removlng the Statute of 
L|m|tat|ons on Crlmmal and C|v|l Actlons lnvolvmg Sexual Abuse of Mlnors" 
It |s lmperatlve that th|s commlttee and the State of Mame abollsh the statute of l|m|tat|ons for chnld 
sexual assault Sexual assault at any age |s not an easy crlme to report It mvolves guvmg one's self over 
entnrely to the jLldlCla| system and law enforcement |n the asp|rat|ona| hope that they w||l do the right 
thmg, that you wall be belleved as a v|ct|m, and that the status of an offender, |nclud|ng the|r statlon |n 
the commumty, w|l| not matter to the lmpartlal adm|n|strat|on 0fjUStlCE When former US House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert was accused of Chlld sexual assault as a teacher and wrestllng coach |n lll|no|s, the story 
seemed unbelrevable to every smgle person who heard |t, except, of course, l‘llS v|ct|ms Long-t|me lll|no|s 
Attorney General LlS8 Madlgan, who knew Hastert, was equally as shocked In dec|d|ng to nmmedlately 
work w|th the lll|no|s Leglslature to end the statute of llmltatlons on ch|ld sexual assault, both c|v|lly and 
crlmmally, |n Ill|no|s, Madlgan reflected, of v|ct|ms, that "for decades they struggle to come to terms wlth 
the terrlble lmpacts these cnmes have on the|r l|ves - mcludmg the troublmg fact that few of the 
perpetrators are ever held accountable " 
It took slgnlflcant tragedy |n lll|no|s to compel change, as |t too 
often does 
l ask you to conslder the followmg statlstlcs, all sourced from the Mame Coal|t|on Agamst Sexual Assault 
one m ﬁve Mamers w|I| experlence sexual assault m the|r ||fet|me, accountlng for approxlmately 14,000 
of our c|t|zens However, |n 2019, only 514 sexual abuse matters were reported to Mame law 
enforcement That would mean approxlmately 3 6% of cases were reported, and the reason for that IS 
the 8b_|EC'£ trauma v|ct|ms must l|ve w|th before, dunng, and after commg forward 
One |n ﬁve women have been the v|ct|m of attempted or completed rape |n thelr l|fet|me - and one |n 
four m|nor males have experlenced sexual vlolence |n the|r l|fet|me Persons under 18 years of age

account for 67% of all sexual assault v|ct|m|zat|ons reported to law enforcement agencles Shockmgly, 
C|'1l|dl ‘€l'l under twelve years old are at least 34% ofthese cases, worse yet, chlldren under s|x account for 
at least 14% of tlu-zse cases Those are brutally, pamfully sobermg stat|st|cs, and are demonstratlve of why 
we must 8bO|lSh the statute of l|m|tat|ons surroundmg th|s horr|f|c cr|me It IS cruel to expect v|ct|ms to 
come forward on an arb|trary tlmetable set by the state, and |t IS also unreallstlc Th|nk about the 
followmg numbers wh|le 5% of ch|ld sexual assaults were reported to school author|t|es, 86% of the 
sexual assaults agamst chlldren |n Mame went unreported, year over year Persons under 18 who are by 
any measure dnﬁerently abled have an even hlgher rate of unreported abuse These numbers are 
mtolerable, and as a Leg|slature, we have a moral obllgatlon to protect chnldren, and to do so now, by 
el|m|nat|ng the crlmmal and c|v|l statutes of l|m|tat|ons durmg th|s Leg|slat|ve sesslon, wlthout further 
delay Ma|ne's rural countles have chlldren at even greater r|sk, s|nce |n communltues where everyone 
knows each other - and that |s vlrtually every commumty |n Mame - the chances of a report bemg made 
agamst an offender by a ch|ld are almost non-exlstent 
It's a slmple proposltlon v|ct|ms deserve justlce |n both cr|m|nal and c|v|l venues No one should be able 
to perpetrate this ev|l and slmply walk away, conﬁdent that tlme IS on thelr slde - and as we s|t here, tlme 
IS Indeed, on thelr s|de I urge you to read the testlmony provlded |n support of this b|l| I urge you to 
l|sten to what you w|ll hear today, and send thus b||| out of Commlttee to the floor and to the Governor's 
desk before one more ch||d IS v|ct|m|zed 
Thank you for your tame and conslderatlon, I would be happy to answer any questlons you may have
