Involvmg Sexual Abuse of Mmors 
DA May 10, 2023 
The Crlmlnal Law Advrsory Comm1ss1on (CLAC)* respectfully submlts the followmg 
testlmony regardlng LD 1790 
CLAC takes no pos1t1on w1th respect to Sectlon 1 of the b111, Wh1Cl1 pertams to c1v1l statutes 
of lumtatlons 
CLAC 1s not commentlng on the pohcy of extendlng the statute of 11m1tat1ons for the 
deslgnated crlmes However, CLAC does not support Sectron 2 1t 1n 1ts current form, grven draftlng 
concerns members have noted 
We note ﬁrst that exrstmg paragraph 8(l)(B) and proposed paragraph 8(1)(C) overlap, some 
crlmes fall lnto both prov1s1ons Draftlng lssues mclude the followlng Paragraph C 1s drafted 
w1th reference to an age l1m1t (18) that 1s often not an element of the crrme-—In many lnstances 1n 
Chapters 11 and 12, the cnmes aga1nstch11dren are deﬁned w1th reference to the v1ct1m not havmg 
attalned the age of 16, 14 or 12 In addltton, 1t would be srmpler to desrgnate a speclﬁc date rather 
than to reference the effectlve date generally (crrmes “commrtted on or after the effectrve date of 
th1s paragraph ”), as readers of the statute W111 not know the effect1ve date of the law wlthout further 
research 
In order to make the prov1s1on more cons1stentw1th exrstmg paragraph B, 1t mrght be 
constructed as follows “If the v1ct1m had not attalned the age of 18 [or other age desrgnated by the 
Leg1slature] at the tlme of the crlme, a prosecutlon for a crlme defined w1th1n chapter 11 or chapter 
12 Th1s paragraph appl1es to conduct commltted on or after [date] ” (Thxs language 1s cons1stent 
w1th the b1l1, 1t does not change the pohcy promoted by the LD of el1m1nat1ng the l1m1tat1ons perlod 
for more crrmes) 
The C1'1II‘l6 of lncest, 17-A M R S § 556, 1s not w1th1n Chapter ll or 12 We offer th1s 
observat1on solely to notlfy the Leg1slature that mcest 1nvolv1ng a v1ct1m under 16 would remarn 
w1th1n exlstmg paragraph B, and rncest 1nvo1v1ng a v1ct1m aged 16 or 17 would remarn SLlb_]6ClZ, as 1t 
currently 1s, to the general l1m1tat1ons perrods appl1cable to Class D (three years) and C crrmes (srx 
years) 1n 17-A M R S § 8(2)
