TESTIMONY OF MEAGAN SWAY, ESQ’ 
Ln OppOSltlOTL to 
LD 1790 — An Act Removing the Statute of Limitations on Criminal and 
Civil Actions Involving Sexual Abuse of Minors 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary

Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, greetings My name 1S Meagan 
Sway, and I am policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine,a 
statewide organization committed to advancing and preserving C1V1l liberties 
guaranteed by the Maine and U S Constitutions through advocacy, education, and 
litigation On behalf of our members, we oppose Section 2 of LD 17 90 
We recognize the very difficult issues raised by LD 1790, including the great time 
and pain that it sometimes takes for a victim to grasp What has happened to them 
after they have been victimized Sexual abuse against anyone, particularly children, 
1S despicable and victims are often, for a variety of reasons, unable to come forward 
immediately after such abuse has taken place Our opposition to this bill 1S not 
intended to diminish the courage of sexual assault victims to come forward 
However, we oppose it because of the important safeguards that a statute of 
limitations provides to the accused° 
Statutes of limitations play an essential role in the criminal Justice system and are 
carefully designed to preserve the right to prosecute while also protecting 
defendants ’ rights Statute of limitations are “designed to promote Justice by 
preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to 
slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have dis- 
appeared ”1 In any prosecution that takes place after a significant passage of time, 
an innocent person accused of a crime may be unable to remember where they were 
on a particular day Additionally, alibi witness’ memories fade, or such witnesses 
move away or otherwise become inaccessible By eliminating statutes of limitation 
entirely, a person could find themselves practically without the ability to defend 
themselves because all exculpatory evidence 1S gone
\ 
There 1S no denying that our criminal legal system often fails to deliver Justice for 
victims of sexual assault However, in order to truly address this lack of Justice, we

should start w1th blgger barrlers that prevent survlvors from f1nd1ng solace 1n our 
legal system. Fzrst, we should start w1th the blggest barrler to entry fear of ever 
report1ng to law enforcement A 2015 report that draws on 1nterv1ews w1th 900 
people mvolved 1n supportlng S11I‘V1VOI'S of sexual assault found that 88 percent of 
respondents answered that pol1ce “somet1mes ” or “often” do not belleve survlvors or 
blamed survivors for the vlolence 2 It 1s no wonder, then, that only 14 percent of 
sexual v1olen1:e v1ct1ms report the offense to pol1ce 3 Second, many v1ct1ms f1nd that 
even W1th support from pollce, they have d1ff1cult experlences progresslng through 
the cr1m1nal legal system Of the 14 percent of sexual assault v1ct1ms who report 
the1r assault to pol1ce, only 30 percent proceed to tr1al, and only 6 5 percent of 
defendants are conv1cted of the or1g1nal offense 4 These are 1ssues that have noth1ng 
to do w1th the statute of l1m1tat1ons, but affect 76 percent of sexual assault v1ct1ms 
Sex crlmes, and allegat1ons of sex crlmes, provoke strong emot1ons For th1s very 
reason, 1t 1s mcumbent upon lawmakers to recogmze that the cr1m1nal legal system 
1s suscept1ble to error, and that as a consequence, people who are lnnocent may 
become the targets of cr1m1nal prosecutlons For those who are wrongly conv1cted of 
sexual offenses, the consequences of the wrongful conv1ct1on are harsh sex offender 
reg1str1es, 1nvas1ve probatlon, and resldency restrlctlons can serve to l1m1ta 
person’s alnlity to re1ntegrate 1nto soclety 
We understand that sexual assault 1s part1cularly rldden w1th shame and fear, and 
that as a result the leg1slature has 1n the past already slngled out sex CI'1II16S 
aga1nst young people as exempt from the ordmary statute of l1m1tat1ons there 1s no 
statute of l1m1tat1ons for crlmes l1sted 1n Chapter 11 of the cr1m1nal code 1f 
commltted aga1nst a ch1ld under the age of 16, see 17-A M R S A §8(1)(B), and 
felony sex crnnes agamst people of any age have a 20 year statute of l1m1tat1ons, as 
opposed to the usual s1x year statute of l1m1tat1ons to br1ng other felony charges 
The latter change was made only 4 years ago, 1n 2019 We urge the leg1slature to 
exerc1se cautlon 1n el1m1nat1ng a statute of l1m1tat1ons altogether 
Because el1m1nat1ng the statute of l1m1tat1ons removes lmportant due process 
protectlons and lmposes ser1ous rlsks to due process and the ab1l1ty of the lnnocent 
to defend themselves, we ask you to vote ought not to pass on LD 1790
