Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 867, An Act Regarding Undesignated Ready -to-use Glucagon Rescue Therapies in Schools , 
proposes t o allow a primary or secondary public school, public charter school, or approved 
private school to obtain a standing order for undesignated ready -to-use glucagon  rescue therapy.  
This therapy is used to treat severe hypoglycemia and can be taken as a spray into the nose or as 
a subcutaneous injection. In cases of severe hypoglycemia, a s tudent may not be able to swallow 
glucose -containing foods or liquids that would ordinarily help to bring their own glucose levels 
into a safe range.  Ready -to-use glucagon therapies in school can provide a fast hypoglycemia 
treatment that can save lives.  
The Office of School and Student Supports, C oordinated School Health Team recently released a 
Guide to Diabetes Management . The purpose of this resource guide is to assist registered 
professional nur ses (RN) , educators, and all school staff members to help students with diabetes 
participate fully and meet goals pertaining to glucose control and stability, academics, physical 
education, and extracurricular activities. This can be accomplished through clinical assessments, 
monitoring, nutrition, exercise, staff/student education and risk reduction measures.   The 
Decision Tree for Coordination and Oversight  outlines the steps a registered professional nurse 
should follow in planning for a student who requires medication, or specific nursing tasks in 
school. The  RN is responsible for developing and revising the student’s individualized healthcare 
plan (IHP) and for following the steps of the decision tree. The RN’s responsibility includes 
assuring that unlicensed school personnel  are not doing any “health counsel ing, teaching or any 
task that requires independent, specialized nursing knowledge, skill or judgment”  according to 
Maine State Board of Nursing, Rules Ch. 6 . A medical provider c reates a diabetes medical 
management plan which the school nurse uses to create an individual health plan and emergency 
action plan for school and transportation if needed.  
According to the Department’s School Health Annual Report 2021 -22, there are 555 students in 
PK-12 schools in Maine with a diagnosis of diabetes , a number that is in alignment with national 
rates . Access to this life -saving medication has become an equity issue as it sometimes poses 
financial or logistical challenges for families with children with diabetes. Families with limited

financial resources or insurance coverage may not be able to supply the medication to their 
children’s school, increasing the chances of adverse outcomes in school settings.  There are at 
least two states t hat have already enacted similar legislation and the Department supports  efforts 
to reduce barriers to health at school.  
Implementing stock glucagon could result in significant fiscal impact for  school administrative 
units ( SAUs ). School administrative units will need to purchase the medication  and replace it as 
it is used or expires. The current level of school health specialists  within the Department can 
maintain the evidence -based Guide to Diabetes Management , which will support RNs and school 
administrative units in implementing stock glucagon. The Department in partnership with the 
Maine Association of School Nurses ha s, in the past, collaborated with me dical partners to 
provide training to school nurses and o ther school staff in the care of students with diabetes. 
These collaborations will continue.  
There are several opportunities to improve the language proposed in this bill  that will align the 
language with  current  Maine  statute s, rule s, or practice s. Maine Revised Statutes Title 20 -A 
section 6403 -A (5) directs the Commissioner to issue guidelines on the provision of school 
health services and health -related activities  and Rule Chapter 40  :  Rule for Medication 
Administration in Maine Schools provides  directions  for school administrative units in 
implementing the provision of the medication statute that provides direction for training of 
unlicensed school personnel in the administration of medication. I t is unclear i f the intent of this 
bill is to include stock gluca gon within the Chapter 40  rule, which would requir e a major 
substantive rule change . It is also important to clarify and align definitions of terms that are  
already used in statute and rule. ‘Diabetes care plan’, ‘health care provider’ and ‘school 
employee’ should all be carefully reviewed to ensure they are in alignment. The term 
‘information sheet’ for transportation is vague and might  better be described as an Emergency 
Action Plan.   
Policies such as this can improve healthcare equity and access to life -saving care across Maine 
but must be implemented carefully to avoid negative  unintended con sequences  or perceived 
barriers for schools . 
The Department will be available to provide addit ional information on LD 867 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
