to uphold their end of the bargain under the law, but sometimes consumers just don't know 
that they have protections. We would much rather see the laws on the books have more 
publicity before adding any other provisions that could hurt consumers and contractors alike. 
ABC Maine is happy to sit at the table to find solutions on how industry and government can 
work together to engage in such a campaign. 
We sympathize with those homeowners who have been unfairly taken advantage of. At ABC 
Maine we strive for excellence in the construction trades and encourage all our members to be

Thank you and I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have or provide answers I do not 
for the work session.
