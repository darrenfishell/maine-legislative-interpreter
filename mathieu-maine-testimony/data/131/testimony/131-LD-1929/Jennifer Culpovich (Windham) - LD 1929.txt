Dear Ms Roberts
I am extremely pleased anyone in a public office is acknowledging the struggles of 
home construction in Maine.
We have had over $100k stolen from us from Tony Fortin of Twin Cities 
construction. He is a thief and we will prosecute. But, that's not going to help anyone 
because most likely he won't pay and we'll just be wasting our money on attorney 
fees. Plus a year later we are still trying to finish our home while paying rent. It's 
extremely stressful.
I don't know the solution but an ongoing dialogue should be occurring. Something 
needs to be done to deter a person from even thinking about being so cruel and 
negligent. Other states do not have as rampant corruption and reckless construction as
we do in an unregulated, unlicensed field. 
Please keep fighting for the families like ours who lost life savings to evil, selfish 
crooks operating right in plain sight with egregious evidence.
Sincerely
Jennifer Culpovich
