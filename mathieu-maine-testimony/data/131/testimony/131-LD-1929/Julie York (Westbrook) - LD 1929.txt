As a Maine resident currently working with both the Maine and New Hampshire AG 
regarding a "contractor" from New Hampshire who scammed us out of over 125K and
others in Maine and New Hampshire for much more, I am shocked that the 
conversation about licensing contractors is even on the table. Licensing contractors 
would provide Maine people a place to start. It would provide us knowledge ahead of 
who is trying to do the work for us. As a teacher, I need a license. As a business 
owner, I need a license. Nail technicians need licenses. Given the financial harm that 
has happened, and continues to happen throughout our state, what possible reason is 
there to not have contractors be licensed? Unlicensed contractors get away with huge 
crimes. It's ridiculous the amount of effort and work victims like myself have to go 
through for these criminals to have consequence. The loop holes do nothing but hurt 
the consumers. Please license contractors.
