I have only lived in Maine for 1 year and have already found the business practices of 
many contractors to be reprehensible.   Story after story of shoddy work or worse, 
contractors taking money and not providing the service.  I personally I am in a 
situation where a contractor is not delivering on his promises.  I may be one of the 
lucky homeowners, as my contractor is now looking for a solution that will keep both 
parties happy.  Risk of losing a license or fines could go a long way in getting 
contractors to operate in good faith.
