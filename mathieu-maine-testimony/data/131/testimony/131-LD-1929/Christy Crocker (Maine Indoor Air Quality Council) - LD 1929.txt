LD 1173 : An Act to Protect Consumers by Licensing Home Building Contractors  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council (“MIAQC” or the “Council” ) is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization  
dedicated to creating healthy, productive and environmentally sustainable  indoor environments in 
Maine.  Our efforts focus on the development of education, communications, and advocacy for safe and 
healthy indoor environments where Maine citizens live, work, play and learn.  
 
 
Dear Senator Curry , Representative Roberts , and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement, and Business  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council submits this testimony in support of LD 1173, LD 1173:  An Act to 
Protect Consumers by Licensing Home Building Contractors  
 
Testimony  
 
Contractor li censing in Maine would close a  life safety gap.  
 
• Buildings have one primary purpose:  to protect people.  Buildings create a habitable environment 
when conditions outdoors are not.  
 
• Maine currently licenses a variety of professions whose services protect  the healt h and safety of 
building occupants:  electricians, plumbers, HVAC contractors, architects, engineers , and more .   
 
• Yet the one profession MOST responsible for creating a safe and healthy indoor environment --
building contractors --has been curiously omitted from Maine ’s licensing infrastructure , leading to a 
gap of professional knowled ge for creating built environments that won ’t harm people .   
 
Uniformity currently lacking.  
 
Maine has already invested a lot of time and resources to create a uniform building code that all 
communities can use to ensure that their newly constructed or renovated buildings don’t harm the 
people in them.   Yet, those  with the greatest responsibility for implementing the MUBEC (Maine 
Uniform Building and Energy Code) are currently provided t he least support for doing so.  This results 
in a lack  of statewide uniformity for the construction of healthy, energy -efficient buildings, primarily 
because builders aren ’t trained on how to meet the code.  While LD 1929 doesn ’t specifically address

code courses for licensed contractors, it does set a minimum requirement of education for licensure 
and directs additional education considerations to be addressed through rulemaking.   
 
MIAQC is available to help.  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council has been working with and providing training to members of 
Maine ’s construction community for 25  years.  The Council would be happy to work with those tas ked 
with creating and implementing the rules for contractor training and compliance.  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council is willing to answer any questions or provide additional information to assist you at the work session.
