An Act to Protect Consumers by Licensing Home Building Contractors 
RE: LD 1929 HP 1237 " 
An Act to Protect Consumers by Licensing Home Building Contractors" 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and Members of the Committee, 
l am Carl Chretien a residential contractor in southern Maine, member of the Home Builders and Remodelers Association 
here in Maine as well as a State Rep at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington DC. 
This is testimony l gave at the public hearing on Tuesday, Mar 26 2019 1:00PM, Cross Building, Room 202 in favor of the bil 
LD 896 "Resolve, Directing the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation To Study a Voluntary Licensing System 
for General Contractors for Home improvement and Construction ” , l as the HBRAME has always in the past a supporter of 
builder licensing. We have had several roadblocks the ﬁrst one l rememberwas having a statewide code which in 2004 the 
state moved towards with the “Maine Model Building Code” enacted in Aprilof that year. The other is that ﬁre personnel as 
well as commercial carpenters who do contracting on the side would berequired to licensed and carry general liability 
insurance as well. 
The HBRAME worked with the in coming up with language that required contracts to have at a minimum a link to the AG’s 
website explaining the consumer things to look for when hiring a home contractor. We have promoted statewide building 
codes that were adopted in 2008 and later worked to keep them in place in towns over 4000 with hopes that at some time 
they would be state wide.

Since the 26"‘ l have reached out to other states to ﬁnd out what they have in place and their comments are below. l would 
be willing to help at a work session that this committee may have. 
Nevada is mandatory licensing, and we enjoy an extremely aggressive contractors ‘ board. 
l am in Iowa we have one city that does a required test for residential contractors. The test must be passed to obtain 
a permit. They told me they average 35 people a year. For a city that builds under 100 homes a year. They told me 
that it has cut down on complaints from residents. l can provide you more info if you want to let me know. 
On the other side l myself believe some type of licensing would be good but lowa is not interested in adding any more types 
of licensing. Thanks 
Sorry Carl, we do not have contractors licensing here in Ohio. We license only plumbing, electrical and H\/AC 
contractors, and for them it is mandatory and requires continuing education. 
NH has nothing - we are watching you and VT to see how you proceed. We will probably start pushing for it in the 
next few years. 
Carl, We are members of this group: , . . . . 
New Jersey does not have licensing for builders or contractors and NJBA has historically opposed any attempts to do 
so. We do have a Contractor's Registration Act and a Builder Registration law tied to a home warranty, but we do 
NOT have licensing. There were several attempts to push licensing here, but we pushed back as they would have

benefits to the builders. 
lllinois does not currently have licensing. There has been talk and some committees to explrfe it, but nothing sofar. 
Every community that l know of does require you to license with them individual - means proof of insurance and of 
course pay a fee. This is also required for the major sub-contractors. 
Tennessee has required licensing and we are one vote in the House away, which is this week, that will require 
continuing ED at 8 hours every two years and membership in a "nationally recognized trade organization ” (NAHB) 
satisﬁes the requirement. We have a great relationship with the licensing board. No temporary or volunteer 
provisions in our licensing requirement. 
NC does not have volunteer licensing. We have mandatory. But l feel the pain of “ﬁreﬁghter, chuck in truck, etc.”. 
Therefore, we as a state HBA are pursuing legislation to require continuing ed for Gen Contractors in NC. The bill 
likely will pass this session for an 8 hr annual requirement. 
Maybe this is further catalyst for your lawmakers to consider licensing as other states are now moving onto required 
CE? 
it was similar here in Massachusetts, but they allowed a one-year period to grandfather in any they slowly have been 
weeded out the problem ones. We also now have 12 hrs. continuing education required every two years. 
Additionally, we nowalso have an HIC license, which is a home improvement contractor where this fee is supposed 
to fund the insurancepool for those that have workmanship suits. 
Licensing is mandatory for homebuiiders and remodelers in Alabama. 
We lobbied our State Legislature and Senate for two years to get it passed. We had tremendous leadership in our 
efforts. 
Our members were in agreement. Our State License board began in the mid-nineties. There is an initial State exam, 
and license has to be renewed each year along with a credit report. Our Licensing and our State Board has been very 
successful. 
Texas does not require general contractors to be licensed. Electricians, plumbers, HVAC installers, irrigators and 
security installers are licensed. 
The Texas Association of Builders supported mandatory registration beginning in about 2002. Plaintiff attorneys 
criticized the system as biased toward builders, and it was discontinued after four years. 
For at least the iast 30 years, our members in Texas have been about evenly split regarding the need for licensure. 
There are compelling arguments on both sides. The devil is always in the details with every licensure bill. l do 
believe code compliance and quality of work are generally good in our state. 
My guess is there would not be much participation in a voluntary licensure program. 
Arizona has had required licensing since 1931. Licensing is required for each type of general contractor and for each 
of the trades. To be licensed requires a certain number of years of experience in the field one once a license in. Both 
a business test and a trade test are required, also required is a full legal background check. Besides our license fee 
we also pay into a recovery fund which is available to those who have been harmed by a licensed contractor and that 
contractor has lost in a series of steps in the complainant process. We also post a contractors bond which the 
amountof the bond is based on your annual volume. it is a crime to perform work as a contractor or sub-contractor 
without a license. 
Our Associations work closely with the Registrar of Contractors and have great input into how we are regulated it has 
been a good working relationship. 
There has been an effort to require some form of continuing education to maintain your license, but that issue has not 
been resolved yet. 
Pennsylvania has no licensing requirements for homebuiiders but does for re-modelers. it’s an issue that constantly 
comes up. I suspect however that we will see it again in a form that requires continuing education and has insurance 
requirements. 
South Carolina has required a Builders License for a number of years. Currently, you must have worked for a building

must be renewed every two years and backed with a $15,000 bond. if you were a builder and move here from another 
state, it must be a state that requires testing. Otherwise, you must apply and take the test. ‘line license mustbe in an 
individual's name so there are no corporate licenses. 
The industry is presided over by a statewide Labor and License committee that oversees complaints. They also 
approve all License requests. 
All subcontractors must be licensed if the job total $5,000 plus. This covers handymen, framers, trim carpenters etc. 
The major trades(plumbing, electrical and H&A) are tested and licensed and each trade has it's own set of tests and 
requirements. 
We have a very good relationship with our governing committee, and they are appointed by the governor. 
in Minnesota we have had licensing since the early 90's. Besides plumbing and electrical we have licenses for 
Builders, Remodelers and Roofers. if you have a builder's license you do not need the other two and a Remodeler 
does not need a Roofers license. There is no experience required but a test of business practices and practical 
knowledge is required. 
We renew every 2 years and are required to have 16 hours of continuing education every two years. Part of our 
license fee is to a Contractor Recovery Fund, that is to help make homeowners whole who are defrauded bya 
contractor. The payout is limited to 300k per contractor l believe. 
There is also a handyman exemption that allows for those with gross receipts of 15k or less to bypass licensing. This 
has been pretty much of a failure as many individuals have significantly exceeded this limit with no consequences. 
Single trade contractors such as drywallers, masons, painters are exempted if they only provide one skill on a project. 
They may provide different skills on different projects but only one per project. 
The state does have a contractor registration for all contractors that provide work in the residential sector also. 
Corporations and those already required to be licensed are exempt from licensing. This also has not worked well as it 
has been communicated poorly, the search on the state website to verify. registration is poor and the state leaves it up 
to the builders and remodelers to enforce. They will ﬁne us for using a sub that is not registered but a homeowner is 
exempt. 
Over the last couple years we have been working to increase penalties for working as an unlicensed contractor. 
Currently it is a misdemeanor on par with unlicensed hair braiding. We have been working to get it reclassi ﬁed asa 
gross misdemeanor nonpartisan with being an unlicensed realtor. This has been held back by realtors who ﬂip 
homes that do not want to go through the licensing process. 
We still have a big issue with unlicensed contractors in more rural areas where the code is not enforced. Since there 
is on one to enforce the code there is no one to verify licensing and therefore a lot of contractors forgo licensing. As 
an association we have also been working on state wide enforcement as a way to reduce unlicensed contractors as 
well. 
Mandatory licensing has not worked for Minnesota in areas where the code is not enforced; l ﬁnd it difficult to believe 
that voluntary licensing would even get off the ground. 
in Arkansas we began mandatory registration in 1999. in 2002 we lobbied for licensing and were successful. 
Everyone that was registered “grandfathered in" . Since then Licensing is mandatory and started out with a test and 
just basic understanding of the licensing law. We've added remodelers and other trades that work directly for the 
public over a value of $2000. Exceptions include anyone building a house for themselves (go ﬁgure) but no more 
than one per year. We tried to get continuing education in 2013 but couldn't get it out of committee. Beginning in 
2015 a small but vocal group of anti~regulation folks tried to abolish Contractor Licensing along withmany other 
licenses. ln 2017 they came close. This year we were able to keep them at bay with a "study" of licensing. My 
suggestion is to start with registration and work hard to get everyone registered before moving to a licensing. 
Iowa only doe’s contractor registration proof of insurance and $50 takes you all the way. We do have some cities that 
require separate licensing. Waterloo has testing 50 questions on code items. North liberty requires a separate 
registration and another $50. Davenport and Sioux City have testing as well. 
This year the legislature tried to require remodelers to post a $75000 bond but the HBA fought it and we were
uyqvuwuuluu. 
We are thinking of asking the group that wanted the bonding to consider the continuing education idea. We support 
that. 
Georgia has had required licensing for about 12 years. Now, to get a licensing, you must show the proper experience, 
take the test, and meet minimal financial strength criteria. Grandfatheringwas allowed early on and that has phased 
out. The biggest problem we now have is dealing withunlicensed builders. 
ldaho has voluntaiy registration in which the contractor initially has to hold one of NAHB’s designations this allows 
you advertise as a state registered contractor and this point licensing is to be held off indeﬁnitely. 
Vtﬁsconsin has two registrations not licenses. All contractors and subs need to register with state with proof of 
insurance, Builders are required to have a "dwelling qualiﬁer” registration as well to be able to pull building permits 
which requires 12 hours of CE every year. There is also required education to get your qualiﬁer initially. Builders are 
required to have subs registrations on permit applications. Commercial general contractors are not required to have 
qualifiers if they don‘t do one and two family construction. 
Connecticut requires a registration for new construction and a separate registration for remodeling. 
Michigan requires all residential builders and maintenance and alteration contractors be licensed. Since June 2008 in order 
to obtain a license the person is required to take 60 hours of pre licensure classes. Upon completion the person makes 
application to the department and then takes the required exam which he/she must pass. 
Sincerely, 
Carl M Chretien
