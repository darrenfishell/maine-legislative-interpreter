G333‘ 
May 1, 2023 
Senator Donna Bailey, Representative Anne Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Services Committee , 
My name is Elayne Richard. I am a staff member with Grandmothers for Reproductive Rights (GRRI), an 
education and advocacy organization led by grandmothers and elders dedicated to advancing reproductive 
health, rights and justice for present and future generations. I’m testifying on behalf of GRR! in support of 
LD 263: An Act to Ensure Access to Healthcare. 
This bill would ensure that access to healthcare services are not diminished as a result of mergers and 
acquisitions of secular health care systems by religiously affiliated ones. Of greatest concern to us is the 
likely decrease in availability to the full range of sexual and reproductive health care services under such 
mergers. To use Catholic owned healthcare systems as an example, Catholic hospitals follow Ethical and 
Religious Directives or (ERDs) that are issued and enforced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
The ERDs ban the provision of key reproductive health services, including contraception, sterilization, 
abortion and infertility services. They also restrict how pregnancy complications and losses are managed, 
and have been known to refuse emergency contraception to victims of sexual assault‘. 
According to a 2020 report by consumer advocacy non-proﬁt Community Catalyst, the growing influence 
of Catholic-owned hospitals has led to 4 of the 10 largest hospital systems in the U.S. being under 
Catholic control, operating across 41 statesz . This same report showed fmdings that 23% of Maine’s 
staffed hospital beds are already in Catholic facilities. As independent hospitals across our rural state 
struggle ﬁnancially, Catholic organizations ’ market and geographic reach means they are often best 
positioned to acquire and survive ﬁnancially, thereby signiﬁcantly shifting the kinds of care Mainers can 
access locally. 
In a state like Maine, such mergers would disproportionately impact rural and low-income individuals 
who typically have less ability to travel for care. Whatever our personal beliefs, we can all agree that 
religious ideology should never curtail Mainers’ access to healthcare in the communities where they live. 
Mainers have, time and time again, voted to support sexual and reproductive healthcare access in our 
state. This bill would further that objective to ensure meaningful access for all of us. GRR! urges the 
committee to vote in support of LD 263: An Act to Ensure Access to Healthcare. 
Thank you for your consideration, 
Elayne Richard & GRR!s across Maine
