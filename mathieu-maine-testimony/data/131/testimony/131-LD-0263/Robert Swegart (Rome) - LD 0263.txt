Robert Swegart
Rome
LD 263
Senator Carney and representative Moonen, Honorable members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Robert Swegart, and I am a resident of Rome. I 
am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619. I was a victim of abortion. When I was
18 years old and in college, I got my girlfriend pregnant and consented to her request 
to abort the child. This event became the beginning of the end of my life. I had 
graduated from high school as president of my class and a committed Christian. I was 
a virgin. I had hopes of completing the pre-med program and pursuing a career as a 
doctor like my deceased father. Those hopes and dreams had to change because I 
quickly became a habitual addict of marijuana and sex. I graduated from college with 
average grades and low self-esteem. I wandered aimlessly for 5 years. Finally, I 
became motivated enough to pursue a career in social work. I was psychologically 
“the-walking-wounded” because of abortion. I did not seek help until I was married, 
with 3 children and 47 years old. By the grace of God, my wife and my children 
helped me to get to a good 12 step program for a long period of time. I still attend 12 
step meetings and I would highly recommend them, and I am 76 years old. By the 
way, I was licensed and practiced as a clinical social worker for 16 years in the state 
of Maine. I can say that the breakdown of the family and the decline in public 
morality that I have observed in Maine is directly attributed to the legalization of 
abortion. Please don’t pass this legislation and make matters worse for countless more
people who will have to suffer the losses that I suffered because of abortion. If you 
care about the levels of public morality in the great state of Maine, just say no.
