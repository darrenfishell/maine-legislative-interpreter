LD 263
I support LD 263 An Act to  Ensure  Access to Health Care. I am a Registered Nurse, 
hold a valid ME RN License and provided 43 years of nursing service to the 
Kennebec Valley Region. Quality healthcare including health education, insurance 
coverage and comprehensive follow through and follow-up for all care rendered 
should be   IMHO the right and privilege of ALL MAINE CITIZENS.
Thank you. Kimberly Hallee 12 Gray Street Waterville ME 04901.
