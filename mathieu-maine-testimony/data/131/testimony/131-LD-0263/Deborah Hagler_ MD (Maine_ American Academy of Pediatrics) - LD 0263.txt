Testimony for LD 263: "An Act to Ensure Access to Health Care"  
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and distinguished members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee, my name is Dr. Deborah Hagler. I am a 
resident of Brunswick, a pediatrician, the mother of two young adults, and concerned 
citizen.  
 Only half of girls who become pregnant in adolescence will receive a high school diploma 
(versus 90% of those who do not become pregnant).   Children of adolescent mothers 
struggle as well. They are more likely to drop out of high school and struggle with health 
problems and unemployment as they age.
1  While rates of sexual activity have not 
changed among adolescents, the teen birth rate has been steadily dropping and contraception has played a significant role.
2  It cannot be overstated that access to 
essential reproductive services is critical for adolescents. Young people are impulsive and 
make careless decisions, often with no foresight into what consequences might result.   
 
LD 263 is very important for the care of adolescents in Maine. Most Catholic controlled  
health care facilities follow the Doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. This prohibits these institutions from offering contraception/ abortion/ condom distribution and the full spectrum of HIV care services, for example. It is a real possibility that a religiously 
controlled provider could become the only option for care in some of our rural 
communities. Teens would have no idea about other options for their reproductive care which could have profound impacts on the future of the young women and the ensu ing 
generation of that community.  
 
LD 263 prevents the loss of access to reproductive services if these situations occur and 
requires that they remain available when systems merge.   
 
The Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly encourages passage of 
this bill for the health and well-being  of our adolescent population.
