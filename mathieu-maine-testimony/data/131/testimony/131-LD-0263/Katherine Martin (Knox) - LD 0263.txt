Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Services, LD 263 - “An Act to Ensure Access to Health Care”, May 1, 
2023.
Representative Sachs, and Members of the Committee:
My name is Katherine Martin. I am testifying in support of LD 263.
I believe this bill is critical for the State of Maine to firmly establish set law in view 
of the Supreme Courts decision that the rights allotted to women regarding their 
health and reproductive decisions be determined by each state’s legislature. It makes 
me sad that our Supreme Court does not recognize this as an act of establishing 
religion.
As a citizen of Maine, and of the United States I worry about the erosion of my 
freedom. The overreach of a religious minority determined to impose the beliefs of 
their group on the nation is scary. Hospitals with a religious affiliation are especially 
problematic. The loss of reproductive rights and freedoms should certainly be 
considered regarding mergers, which deeply affect rural populations.  
I fully support the state of Maine working to maintain health care access for all 
citizens. 
It is my hope that doing so will protect Maine citizens from the insurance industry 
acting as a regulating authority. 
Thank you for this protective piece of legislation. I shall hope it passes.
