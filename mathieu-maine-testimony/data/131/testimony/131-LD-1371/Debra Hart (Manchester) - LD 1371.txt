Re:  LD 1371, An Act to Amend the Limits on the Direct Shipment of Wine 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and Committee Members: 
 
Wine Institute, a public policy association of over 1,000 California wineries and affiliated 
suppliers dedicated to advocating the responsible consumption and enjoyment of wine, is in 
favor of LD 1371, An Act to Amend the Limits on the Direct Shipment of Wine. 
 
Wine Institute wholeheartedly supports winery direct shipment of wine to Maine consumers.  
During the recent pandemic wineries,  like a lot of businesses, had to shutter their facilities.  
Although they continued to make wine, they could not invite guests and visitors iton their tasting 
rooms, which represent a large part of their business model.  And like many businesses, these 
wineries were challenged to come up with unique ways to continue to employ people and keep 
their businesses viable in order to survive a country-wide shutdown.  Being entrapeunters, they 
came up with a way… consumers could participate in virtual wine tastings through shipping 375 
ml wine bottles.  In Maine, however, they were only allowed to ship 750 mls. This bill sponsored 
by Representative Terry will allow a direct shipper to ship no more than 9,000 milliliters (1 case) 
per shipment no more than 12 times a year which would supposrt the bottle-size change that 
was necessitated during the recent pandemic. 
 
Maine has a successful DTC wine shipping program. It continues to provide Maine’s wine 
consumers with the choices they want while at the same time providing additional revenues to 
the state.  
 
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.  
 
Respectfully,
