Testimony in support of LD 1673, “An Act to Encourage Affordable Housing and Mixed- 
use Development by Establishing a Thriving Corridors Program. ”

Good morning, chairpersons Gere and Pierce, and all members of the Housing committee. My 
name is Josie Phillips, and I'm representing Maine Center for Economic Policy. I'm testifying in 
favor of LD 1673 because it would promote efficient city planning that meets the housing and 
transportation needs of Mainers. Walkable cities with ample housing are more economically 
productive and provide significant benefits to their residents ’ health, economic mobility, and 
general satisfaction. Because of this, encouraging cities to develop high-density corridors with 
housing and commercial services close together would contribute to the state's economic 
growth. 
I and many others have testified before this committee on the urgent need to increase housing 
production across the state. This remains true, and LD 1673 would help accomplish this goal by 
providing funding and technical assistance to municipalities looking to redevelop their downtown 
areas or other high-use corridors. Based on its housing production merits alone, LD 1673 would 
warrant serious consideration. 
LD 1673 would not just promote housing blindly across the state but instead would encourage 
housing to be developed in areas where efficiency can be maximized, both from the residents ’ 
and local governments ’ perspectives. According to the World Economic Forum, the costs of 
building and maintaining denser, walkable urban areas are a tenth to a twentieth that of building 
and maintaining more driving-oriented suburban areas.‘ Developing denser neighborhoods 
around key sen/ices like grocery stores and other public services also has significant benefits to 
the environment, as they encourage people to use more environmentally friendly methods of 
transportation, like walking and mass transit. “ Walkable cities are typically more economically 
productive and are better able to attract new workers. “‘ There is also evidence to suggest that 
living in walkable neighborhoods can make residents happier," healthier," more financially 
stable in adulthood (for children who grow up in walkable neighborhoods)," ‘ and more likely to 
spend money in their local economy? “ Developing walkable neighborhoods may also benefit 
older Mainers by providing more opportunities for walking and providing alternative methods of 
transportation should they become unable to operate a car."‘" 
The benefits of thoughtfully planned, dense, walkable neighborhood development are profound 
for everyone. Residents benefit from neighborhoods that encourage physical and social activity 
while ensuring that goods and services are easily accessible. City officials benefit from a more 
efficient use of municipal resources which can then be reinvested in their residents. The entire 
state benefits from the increased economic activity, which can then attract workers considering 
relocating to Maine. Because of these significant and widespread benefits, as well as the 
promise this bill has in addressing Maine’s affordable housing crisis, l encourage this committee 
to vote yes on LD 1673.
