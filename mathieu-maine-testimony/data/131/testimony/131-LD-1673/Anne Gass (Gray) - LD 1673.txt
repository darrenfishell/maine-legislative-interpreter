 Senator Pierce, Representa�ve Gere, and Dis�nguished Members of the Joint 
Commitee on Housing:  
My name is Anne Gass and I’m wri�ng to support  LD 1673 , An Act to Encourage Aﬀordable 
Housing and Mixed- use Development by Establishing a Thriving Corridors Program.  
I am a former Vice -Chair of the Gray Town Council, founder and chair of the Gray Bike -Ped 
Commitee (2012 – 2019), lead author of Gray ’s Bike -Ped Plans (adopted by the Council in 2013 
and updated in 2018) , and of Gray ’s Complete  Street Policy, amon g other things. I have a 
Masters  in Community Planning. My tes�mony is  submite d on m y own behalf , not the Town of 
Gray ’s.  
For over ten years I and others have  been wo rking to revitalize Gray ’s village center , and in 
recent years we ’ve been making great progress. In November 2020 almost 80% of voters 
approved our latest Comprehensive Plan, whic h priori�zes building more housing within a half 
mile of the village center. This is precisely  the sort of development patern LD 1673 is designed 
to support.  
In July 2022  over 200 residents par�cipated in a three -day planning charete  designed to obtain 
input  into, and build consensus around, a  housing, commercial, and  transporta�on vision for 
Gray village. We emerged from this process with a very solid consensus a round what needed to 
happen  both in the village and in the corridors leading into it. We need more housing, beter 
bike-ped infrastructure, on -street parking to support local businesses , and traﬃc calming to 
slow down cars and trucks commu�ng through the v illage.  
We have begu n pu�ng the pieces in place to implement this vision. Steps t o date include 
acquiring vacant parcels for future redevelopment , re-working our ordinances to support the 
vision of denser development pater ns, and working with MaineDOT on plans to rebuild village  
streets to make them more walkable and bikeable.  
As you know, c osts have soared drama�cally since the pandemic , which has severely challen ged 
our ability to con�nue planning  and funding the improvements we want to see. Addi�onal 
funding  and technical assistance , such as that envisioned in LD 1673, is cri�cal to help make our 
vision succeed. These improvements will improve livability for Gray residents living in and near 
the village,  and support local business development.  
I’ve included below some photos that illustrate t he current state of Gray ’s village  center, and 
why funding f or LD 1673 is so necessary.

  Note the wide lanes and 
turning angles that make 
crossing the street 
dangerous for walkers and bikers. They also allow vehicles to move through 
the village at h igh speed.  
Figure 2 Gray Village, Reimagined  
This inadequate sidewalk on Main 
Street narrows down to nothing by 
the end of the building . At that point 
bikers and pedestrians must compete 
with traﬃc rushing to the turnpike 
interchanges a short way ahead.  
 Figure 3: Poor sidewalk design discourages 
walkability.  This is our vision for a 
redesigned Gray Village . 
Narrower road lane s allow 
for wider sidewalks ; these 
and street  trees ma ke 
walkin g & biking more 
possible! Note the vision for 
denser housing 
development.

 How is a person in a 
wheelchair, or a parent 
pushing a child in a stroller, 
supposed to navigate this 
sidewalk  with cars and 
tractor trailers barreling b y 
at speeds of up to 40 -50 
mph?  
 Figure 4:  Current sidewalk on Main Street in 
Gray Villa ge 
Another ridiculous short sec�on 
of sidewalk on Main Street that 
meets the leter of the law 
(ramps down to crosswalks ) but 
is diﬃcult  and unsafe to use, 
especially fo r someone in a 
wheelchair, pushing a stroller, or 
trying to navigate the 
intersec�on with small children. 
Note that the ramp essen�all y 
dumps walkers onto the street 
before  they can even access the 
crosswalk . Figure 5: A wholly in adequate  ramp and 
crosswalk on the corner of Main St. and 
Yarmouth Rd.

This very narrow sec�on of sidewalk 
on Main Street is unsafe and 
unatrac�ve ; really litle more than an 
a�ert hough t. It is almost lost in vast 
curb cuts. It is right on the street with very litle buﬀer from cars racing through the intersec�ons at speeds 
up to 40 -50mph.  
The wide curb cuts serve  a Thai 
restaurant . 
 Figure 6: Current sidewalks on Main St. in Gray 
discourage  use by  walkers an d bikers and oﬀer 
little safety .
