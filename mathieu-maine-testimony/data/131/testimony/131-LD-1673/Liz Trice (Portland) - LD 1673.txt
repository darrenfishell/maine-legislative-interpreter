LD 1673
Dear Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and Members of the Joint Select 
Committee on Housing,
My name is Liz Trice and I live in Portland. 
I'm writing to support LD 1673.
I believe our corridors are the #1 place we can prioritize and support development to 
make a better Maine economically, environmentally, and socially. Corridors are 
already developed. Right now many of our corridors are high speed locations, where 
people don't want to live, walk, jog or shop; they are only good places to drive, and 
even then, tend to have crashes, and not be pleasant as a town center or fast as a 
highway. 
Corridors are places that can have a huge positive impact if we slow traffic down, add
bike and pedestrian facilities, street trees, and encourage multi-level housing and 
shops. Right now it's too hard to build in these areas, and too easy to build sprawling 
single family developments where every resident needs a car to survive, and many 
families and individuals simply can't afford. 
Redesigning corridors requires cooperation between engineers, DOT, main street 
entities, environmental groups, municipal govt' to change zoning, and local and state 
and non-profits funding agencies to provide low cost financing for development. But 
working together is what we need to do in order for the majority of mainers to have 
nice places to live, work and recreate.
Please support LD 1673.
