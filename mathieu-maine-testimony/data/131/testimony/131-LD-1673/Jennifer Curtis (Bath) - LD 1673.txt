My name is Jennifer Cur Ɵs, and I’m wri Ɵng as the Director of Planning for the City of Bath, Main e.  Bath 
is currently upda Ɵng its comprehensive plan, and as part of the process the community ide nƟﬁed 
through a future land use planning exercise, the areas where it most wants to see trans formaƟonal 
change. Though the community may be divided alternately by a 5’ tall concrete wall and a four-lane 
viaduct, it is highly united behind the desire for trans formaƟonal change along the Route 1 corridor. The 
city faces a great challenge in blending the ongoing use of the Route 1 corridor with it’s goals of 
neighborly interacƟons, historical quality of place, and local economic vitality.  AddiƟonal State resources 
are criƟcally needed to assist communi Ɵes like ours in making inten Ɵonal transforma Ɵve change  locally, 
that will have Statewide beneﬁcial impacts.  
I thank you for your Ɵme and welcome your ques Ɵons.  
Best regards, 
 
Jenn CurƟs
