LD 1673
Dear Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and Members of the Joint Select 
Committee on Housing,
I write in support of LD 1673, An Act To Encourage Affordable Housing And 
Mixed-Use Development By Establishing A Thriving Corridors Program. 
Redeveloping high-impact corridors into mixed-income, walkable neighborhoods will
add much needed housing in areas of town that already have infrastructure and can be 
transformed into vibrant neighborhoods. Concentrating housing along existing 
corridors will allow for thousands new housing units to be created close to service and
job centers.
This type of development supports Maineâ€™s climate change goals by reducing reliance
on cars as residents will be able to walk, bike or bus to jobs, shopping, and 
recreational activities. Development along these corridors will also add to the 
municipal tax base without requiring extensive new infrastructure.
LD 1673 is critical as it will help municipalities who want to move in this direction by
providing technical support and financial incentives.
Please vote yes on LD1673.
Thank you.
