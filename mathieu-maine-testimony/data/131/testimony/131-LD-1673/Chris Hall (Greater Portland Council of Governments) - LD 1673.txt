Re: LD 1673, An Act to Encourage Affordable Housing and Mixed-use Development by Establishing a 
Thriving Corridors Program 
 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and Members of the Committee; 
 
Earlier today you received testimony from Abe Dailey, Senior Data Analyst for our organization in 
support of LD 1673, An Act to Encourage Affordable Housing and Mixed-use Development by 
Establishing a Thriving Corridors Program. 
 
Unfortunately, Mr. Dailey was not authorized to represent GPCOG on this legislation – our organization 
has taken no position on LD 1673. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to clarify GPCOG’s position on this bill, and please accept our apology for 
any confusion Mr. Dailey’s testimony may have caused. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Chris Hall 
Director of Regional Initiatives 
Greater Portland Council of Governments
