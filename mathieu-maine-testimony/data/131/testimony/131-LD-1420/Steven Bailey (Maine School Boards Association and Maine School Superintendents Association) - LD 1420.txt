TESTIMONY NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST 
L.D. 1420 -. 
AN ACT TO STRENGTHEN MA1NE’S ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SYSTEM BY 
CLARIFYING PURPOSES AND PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWS OF SCHOOLS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, neither for nor against L.D. 1420. 
Our associations believe it is appropriate that what we refer to as the public private schools, approved for 
tuition purposes, be held to the same standards of review as public schools. We are neither for nor against this 
bill because it adds additional reviews to public schools that are unnecessary. 
20-A, §4504 already requires the Commissioner of Education to determine if public schools are compliant 
with basic school approval standards, including compliance with the Maine Human Rights Act. 
Public schools have been engaged in the school approval process for years and most are on a 2-3-year review 
cycle. If the review raises issues or questions from the Department of Education with public schools, we 
respond. We believe further requirements on public schools are redundant.
