RE:  LD #    303 
_____________________________________________________________________________________  
 
On behalf of the Maine Association of Health Underwriters  (Maine AHU) , I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to submit  comments on the proposed bill. 
 MaineAHU is a state chapter of the National Association of Health Underwriters and represents licensed 
agents, brokers , and employee benefit consultants  who sell and service individual and group health, 
disability, Medicare,  and long -term care insurance.  
While we understand the concerns  expre ssed by LD 303,  we feel the bill is too far reaching in it s scope 
and atte mpts to achieve universal coverage.  We agree  with the sponsor  that building off the current 
employer  based system is the best starti ng point .  The German health care model  does this to a large 
extent but  a better un derstanding of the parameters and regula tions around its  seamless transition for 
employees between emp loyer based heal th insurance, i s needed.   

We also have concerns about getting  waivers from the Federal Government f rom established pro grams 
such as COBRA  which al so allows for continuity for displaced works .  We are especially  concerned with  
replacing Medicare which would seriously disru pt health care for thousands of Mainers while imposing  
an unknown cost of several million dollars  on the Maine taxpayers.  
There is little  mention ed about  lower ing health ca re costs, the primary reason for high health insur ance 
premiums, without bringing provider pay ment s to somewhere near Maine  Care levels.  That would have 
a significant impact on many provider sâ€™ ability to continue i n business.  
That being  said, our orga nization would look forward to partnering  with the Office of Affordable Health 
Care or any other stakeholder  group to develop  workable approac hes to th is issue.   
We would like to thank the Committee for considering our comments and the opportunity to express 
our views. If you have questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
Respectfully,
