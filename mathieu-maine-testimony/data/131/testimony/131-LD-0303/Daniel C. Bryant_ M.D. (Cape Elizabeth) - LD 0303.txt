LD 303
Additional Comments: During my medical career I became aware of the many 
problems in our health care system, especially the un- and under-insured, rising cost, 
waste and complexity, cost-sharing burden, narrow provider networks, job lock, and 
professional burnout and moral injury. LD 303 is an attempt to create “a uniform 
health insurance system across the whole state which will cover everyone” and 
“eliminate for-profit Medicare plans,” but I’m afraid that adding a public option to the
current mix of public programs and private plans, even more tightly regulated ones, 
could still mean that, until everyone is enrolled in it, the current situation will persist.
 
            Therefore, much as I admire the intention of this bill and some of its elements,
I reluctantly testify “neither for nor against” its passage..
 
Thank you.
