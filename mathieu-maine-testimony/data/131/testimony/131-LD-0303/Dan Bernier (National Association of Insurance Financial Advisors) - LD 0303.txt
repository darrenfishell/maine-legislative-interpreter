Of a $1,104.00 Premium~- $7.95 goes to Dividends - $1,096.05 does not go to dividends. 
I\T l‘£<‘. >§ 
1. Most proﬁts are reinvested in the company not paid as dividends. 
2. The difference between a nonproﬁt and a for proﬁt is not proﬁts, it is dividends. Nonproﬁts 
are allowed to make a proﬁt; they are not allowed to pay dividends. For proﬁts also pay 
taxes. 
3. Aetna’s current proﬁt margin of 4.5% is actually a little high by historical standards. It is 
usually less than that. . 
4. The $7.95 is also high because it assumes all proﬁts come from premiums. In reality, a 
portion of proﬁts come from return on investments.
