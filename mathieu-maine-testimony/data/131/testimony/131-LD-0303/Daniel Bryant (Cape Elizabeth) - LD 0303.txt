Testimony on LD 303: An Act to Provide Health Insurance, Reduce Administrative Burdens, 
Reduce Costs and Improve Health Outcomes

During my medical career I became aware of the many problems in our health care 
system, especially the un- and under-insured, rising cost, waste and complexity, cost-sharing 
burden, narrow provider networks, job lock, and professional burnout and moral injury. LD 303 
is an attempt to create “a uniform health insurance system across the whole state which will 
cover everyone” and “eliminate for-profit Medicare plans,” but I’m afraid that adding a public 
option to the current mix of public programs and private plans, even more tightly regulated ones, 
will still mean that, until everyone is enrolled in it, the current situation will persist: 
1. Not everyone will be covered 
2. There will be no mechanism for cost saving.  
3. Waste and complexity will not be reduced. 
4. Cost sharing (point of service charges) will continue to discourage care. 
5. Workers will continue to be tied to their employers’ plans. 
6. Choice will continue to be limited (narrow networks). 
7. Health care professionals will continue to suffer from corporate pressures on them. 
 
 Therefore, much as I admire the intention of this bill, I reluctantly testify “against” its 
passage and urge the committee to focus on more fundamental health care reform. 
 
Thank you.
