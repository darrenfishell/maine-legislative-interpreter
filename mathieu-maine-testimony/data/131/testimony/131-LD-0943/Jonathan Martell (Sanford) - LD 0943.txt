RE: LD 943 An Act to Enhance Privacy and Prohibit Shipping Companies from Maintaining Records of 
Firearm and Ammunition Shipments 
Members of the committee, l would like to express my Support of LD 943 An Act to Enhance Privacy and Prohibit 
Shipping Companies from Maintaining Records of Firearm and Ammunition Shipments. 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. l am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member. 
This bill simply affirms the Federal and Maine Constitutional right to keep and bear arms along with updating 
current Maine law under Title 25 ss2014 to prohibit carriers from creating registries, records or databases for 
firearms and firearm related information. A quick google search will generate multiple results of missing or stolen 
firearm and ammunition packages along with arrest records. As this becomes more common, it is critically 
important that these carriers do not provide easy access to information that may lead to more than just the theft 
of boxes. Imagine knowing where all firearm parts and ammunition is delivered within a city or area. How would 
this be useful to someone looking for steal firearms? 
Please support closing the gap in the law, by supporting this bill. 
Sincerely, 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
