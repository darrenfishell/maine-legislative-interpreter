LD 943
I oppose LD 943, “An Act to Enhance Privacy and Prohibit Shipping Companies 
from Maintaining Records of Firearm and Ammunition Shipments” on similar 
grounds. It is common practice for shipping companies to keep records on all sorts of 
items, and in the case of items like alcohol, must report and keep records on those 
items to comply with legal requirements and to ensure that such items to not get into 
the hands of minors. To do their job properly, shipping companies must keep detailed 
records of items and those shipping them, to ensure that items get where they are 
supposed to be going. This bill would make it impossible for shipping companies to 
conduct their business, as their business is based in keeping careful track of items 
shipped. The bill is frankly nonsensical and OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
