LD 943
Honorable committee members, 
It is the business of an individual and that individual alone what they purchase and 
have shipped to their home, and no records should be kept by any shipping company 
that could be used to draw a direct connection between an individual and specific 
firearms or types of ammunition.
LD 943 ought to pass!
Thank you
