LD 943
I'm writing in support of LD 943, "An Act to Enhance Privacy and Prohibit Shipping 
Companies from Maintaining Records of Firearm and Ammunition Shipments."
I don't want the federal government or state government to maintain a list of firearms 
owners, so I certainly don't want shipping companies to do so. If allowed, it will only 
be a matter of time that the feds or the states would use this list to circumvent federal 
or state laws.  
Article I, Section 16 of the Maine Constitution states that every citizen has a right to 
keep and bear arms and this right shall never be questioned. I find maintaining any 
form of lists or databases of firearms owners to be a violation of this Constitutionally 
protected natural right. 
I urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 943.
Sincerely, James M Waite
