LD 1471
LD 1471 An Act to Amend Provisions of the Maine Metallic Minerals Act 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and the Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources my name is Arleigh Kraus I am a registered cannabis caregiver 
with a B.S. in biochemistry, an organic farmer, and business owner in Warren. I am a 
board member of Maine based Citizens against Residential Mining Activities 
(CARMA) and a concerned citizen scientist. 
I am presenting testimony in support of LD 1471.
The need for responsible mining practices to be investigated and researched is 
imperative.  The framework for best practices for metallic mineral mining, associated 
health risks from all aspects of mining, and ancillary infrastructure must be studied.  
This bill is a positive step towards opening up discussions around these important 
topics.  
Please consider ought to pass LD1471
Respectfully,
Arleigh A. Kraus
