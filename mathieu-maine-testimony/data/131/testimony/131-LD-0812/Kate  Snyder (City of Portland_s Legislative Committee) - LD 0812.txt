Testimony Neither  for Nor  Against LD 812, An Act to Assist Clerks in Facilitating

Increasing Time for  Absentee Ballot Pr ocessing and In-person Voting
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs:
On behalf of the City of Portland, I write to you today to testify neither for nor against LD 812,
An Act to Assist Clerks in Facilitating Elections and to Improve Access to In-person Absentee
Voting for Working People by Increasing Time for Absentee Ballot Processing and In-person
Voting. While we believe elements of this bill could benefit municipalities’  election
administration processes, we are also concerned about its financial impact.
The provision in LD 812 that allows 14 days for the processing of absentee ballots (instead of 7
as in current law) would be a welcome change to the Portland City Clerk’ s office. The extra
processing time would be especially helpful during Presidential elections, when voter turnout is
particularly high.
While it’ s important to provide voters with flexibility in terms of when and where they can
vote, and although it may of fer voters additional convenience, we do not believe that requiring
an expansion of voting hours through the weekend would be the best use of funding, given the
many existing opportunities voters have to cast their ballot. We estimate the cost of this
mandate would be up to $3,000 per day for the City of Portland.
Thank you for your consideration.
