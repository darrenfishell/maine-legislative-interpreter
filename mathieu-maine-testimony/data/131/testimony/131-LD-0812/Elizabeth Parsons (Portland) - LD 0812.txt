As a deputy registrar for the City of Portland, over the past several years I have 
witnessed increasing citizen interest in voting.  Maine's same day voter registration is 
something people frequently remark positively on when they arrive at our registration 
tables. And long lines colleagues and I watch at our polling stations seem to come 
more frequently each election cycle. This bill contains reasonable recommendations 
to make voting more accessible and that make a lot of sense to me. I encourage 
Committee members to vote Ought to Pass on this measure. Thank you.
