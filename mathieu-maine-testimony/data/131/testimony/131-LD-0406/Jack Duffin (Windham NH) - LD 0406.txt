I am for, among other bills on this page, LD 406, urging Maine to take a step back 
and think about the railroad corridors that they are considering transforming into rail 
trails.
It's probably important for me to note that I'm not a Maine resident. I live in 
neighboring New Hampshire. I find this to be important since the two corridors that 
have garnered the most attention (namely the Mountain Division from Portland to 
Fryeburg and the Berlin Subdivision from Portland to Lewiston) are the first miles of 
interstate corridors. Both of them have connections to New Hampshire and Vermont. 
Were our states asked about our opinions on ripping up vital portions of these 
railroads?
MaineDOT needs to take a solid look at the potential uses of these lines, passenger 
and freight, in a way that includes all stakeholders (how involved was G&W in the 
process, really?). Simply going with the cheapest option of a trail is a detriment to the 
elderly and disabled, and hampers economic growth. I've seen it firsthand; New 
Hampshire has nearly 365 miles of these rail trails. 
To disregard neighboring states in the northern New England region on these 
corridors is, frankly, insulting. I implore you to take another, proper, unbiased look.
