Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and members of the Transportation 
Committee,
My name is Gerry O’Connell.  I am a resident of New Hampshire.  My company is 
currently engaged in development at locations in Maine where we have identified as 
future train station locations.  At Bethel Station in Bethel, Maine we are close to 
breaking ground and have positive expectations that sometime in the near future the 
State of Maine will initiate a passenger train service from Portland through to 
Montreal with a stop at the existing Bethel Maine Train station. 
Our firm has also identified station location sites on railroad corridors in Maine.  
These corridors are mostly owned by the State of Maine.  I am testifying in support of
LD 406 Directing the Department of Transportation To Develop and Adopt a Rail 
Corridor Use Vision Plan for State of Maine-Owned Railroads.
We are aware of the benefits for recreational trails using these corridors and 
connecting to stations.  However, it was brought to our attention that trail users want 
to convert the railroad to become a public trail by removing the railroad tracks.  We 
support LD 406 as an opportunity for everyone with an interest in these railroads to 
have a better understanding of the best use, and how developers like us may bring 
value to places with passenger train service.
Please vote to support LD 406 to get information out to all parties so the value of 
investing in railways is known.
