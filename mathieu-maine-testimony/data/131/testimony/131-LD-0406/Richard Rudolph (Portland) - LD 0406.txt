Re:  In Support of LD 406

Dear Senator Ben Chipman and Representative Lynn Williams and other Members 
of the Committee. 
  
My name is Richard Rudolph.  I am a Portland resident who has served as the chair 
of Amtrak’s National Customer Advisory Committee, and currently serve on the 
Maine Rail Group's Board of Directors and chair the Rail Users Network which 
represents long distance, commuter and transit rail riders all across America.   I 
also serve on the “Lower Road Rail Use Advisory Committee.” 
 
I am here today to ask you to support LD406.  The enactment of this bill will 
provide time to consider the use of these state owned rail assets that were 
purchased by Maine taxpayers in the late 1980’s for possible future passenger and 
freight rail services.    
  
 I strongly believe that a feasibility study needs to be completed before any state 
rail line can be converted to recreational use.  The passage of LD 406 is an 
essential first step.  The passage of the Governor’s bill LD 2124 during the last 
days of the 130th legislation session repealed a section of the 2003 State Railroad 
Preservation and Assistance Act that provided that state-owned track may not be 
dismantled or changed until the Department of Transportation, in consultation with 
other agencies, determines that “it will not have a negative impact on a region or 
on future economic opportunities for that region”.  As far as I can tell that 
provision has been completely ignored.  The same consultant hired to do a 
propensity study to determine possible ridership between the major cities in central 
Maine and Portland was engaged to provide an economic analysis to determine 
the potential economic benefits for establishing a recreational trail on the state 
owned rail line.  Unbelievably, the consultants maintained that the state would 
benefit more economically from bicyclists or walkers than from train riders. 
 
The passage of LD2124 has given the Maine State Commissioner of 
Transportation the discretion to appoint who serves on these committees resulting 
in a deck stacked in favor of converting the inactive state-owned rail corridors for 
recreational trail use.  There was only one rail advocate appointed to each of these 
committees.  Although I personally raised a point of order at the first “Lower 
Road” RUAC meeting stating that there is no representation from either Bangor or 
Waterville, no action has been taken on this matter.  These central Maine 
communities should ultimately have a voice regarding which of the two lines 
should be used to restore passenger service to their communities.  
 
The passage of LD406 will enable MEDOT through a competitive bid process 
and with the advice of the advisory committee established under section 4 the 
ability  to evaluate  the reasonable potential uses, benefits and costs of restoring the 
state owned rail corridors.  It will also study where railroad stations could be built 
and how this could drive new economic activity.    
 
There seems to be a mad rush to tear up the state-owned railways and convert them 
into bicycle / walking paths without first analyzing how restoring these lines could 
enhance the mobility of citizens in central Maine and support new economic 
development for Maine businesses. 
  
Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. 
  
Sincerely, 
  
Richard Rudolph, Ph.D.
