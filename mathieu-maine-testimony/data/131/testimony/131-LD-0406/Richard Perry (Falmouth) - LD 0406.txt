LD 406
In reference to LD406, I am against LD406.  
I live at 129 Middle Road in Falmouth.  It's bad enough that I live next to I-295 and 
have dealt with the loud noise of this heavy traffic for over 26 years.  The railroad 
tracks are in my backyard with very few trees as a boundary or privacy protection 
from passer-byes looking into my bedroom and bathroom windows at the exact same 
eye level as this proposed trail.  On the other side of my house is Route 9/Middle 
Road which has become a very busy road where many drivers regularly go well over 
the speed limit of 35 mph endangering my family and dog.  There will be absolutely 
zero backyard privacy for me and my family if this proposed trail is allowed. I use the
backyard often for gardening, small bon fires, playing with my dog and kids.  Having 
more people walk, run or bike by will force me to sell the house and move elsewhere 
before this trail is developed.  Please help maintain me and my families sanity by 
voting against LD406/860. I am also very upset how this trail proposal has been 
deceitfully and intentionally kept quiet from the public and my neighbors because 
those in favor of the trail don't live anywhere near it and are not impacted by it in any 
way at all. Who will be responsible for cleaning up the trash and waste left on the 
trails, not to mention dog feces?  Please do not approve this LD406 proposal.
