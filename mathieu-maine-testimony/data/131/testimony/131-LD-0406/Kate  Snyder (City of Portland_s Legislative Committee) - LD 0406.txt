Senator
Chipman,
Representative
W illiams,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
T ransportation:
I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portland’ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
Support
of
LD
406,
Directing
the
Department
of
T ransportation
T o
Develop
and
Adopt
a
Rail
Corridor
Use
V ision
Plan
for
State
of
Maine-Owned
Railroads.
Based
on
the
City
of
Portland’ s
recent
involvement
with
multiple
rail-related
studies
and
initiatives,
including
passenger
rail
feasibility
to
Lewiston
and
the
Portland-to-Auburn
Rail
Use
Advisory
Council,
it
has
become
clear
that
a
guiding
vision
of
the
future
use
of
critical
state
corridors
is
necessary ,
for
everything
from
passenger
transportation
to
freight
to
active
transportation
connections.
The
actions
included
by
this
legislation
would
provide
the
high-level
analysis
needed
to
move
the
State
of
Maine
on
a
path
toward
sustainable
community
development
and
away
from
auto-centric
planning;
this
shift
is
essential
to
an
ef fective,
forward-looking
course
as
we
navigate
climate
and
housing
crises.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
