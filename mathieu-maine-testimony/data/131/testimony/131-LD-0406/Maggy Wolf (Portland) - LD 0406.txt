LD 406
My name is Maggy Wolf and I SUPPORT  LD 406! As a resident of Portland, I 
strongly urge you to support LD 406 and the expansion of passenger rail service in the
state of Maine. It is critically important that we preserve rail corridors for passenger 
rail restoration and/or expansion. In these times of extreme climate change, we need 
to expand public mass transit, especially in heavily traveled commuter corridors. It 
would be a huge mistake to remove tracks in these corridors to convert them 
exclusively to trails. I am a big fan of trails and was an early supporter of the East 
Coast greenway and other trails, but passenger rail service has a much bigger 
potential to take cars off the roads. Please pass LD 406 for the sake of the planet!
