In support of LD 406 
April 12, 2023 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and members of the Transportation Committee, 
My name is Sharon Castellucci. I am a Falmouth resident and owner of a 3-acre property abutting 
the Maine tracks in Falmouth across from the Oceanside Retirement community and near the 
Falmouth Route one businesses. I am testifying in suppoit of LD 406 Directing the 
Department of Transportation To Develop and Adopt a Rail Corridor Use Vision Plan for 
State of Maine-Owned Railroads. 
It was brought to my attention that a group ofbike riders and trail users want to convert the 
railroad that abuts my property into a public trail. I am opposed to this. 
I have always considered my property to be an ideal location for a train station. I have been 
approached by developers offering to develop my land as a train station and housing. We are in 
serious discussions. I think a passenger train station within walking distance to the largest 
retirement community in the area and near Falmouth shopping and services would be very good. 
Not once have I been contacted by anyone wanting to make this land a trail. I do not wanta 
public trail crossing my property. I think the people wanting this have intentionally left people 
like me out of the discussions because they know this will reduce the value of my property. This 
bill LD 406 will allow everyone to discuss how to use this state railroad and will allow plans for 
a train station at my property to be heard. 
Please vote to support LD 406 and let’s have some open discussions and real answers to what 
this railroad can be used for.
