LD 406
I am writing this testimony in opposition to LD406.  I live at 128 Middle Road in 
Falmouth.  I am not in favor of the Casco Bay Trail being constructed.  It will be 
intrusive to me and my neighbors who live along the railroad tracks. I also know that 
people on the trail will use our property as cut throughs/shortcuts to go onto Middle 
Road and other places.  Who will be in charge of keeping the area clean and free of 
trash and debris?  My yard is already often the local trash can on Middle Road and is 
often littered with trash people throw out the window of their passing car.  My other 
concern is for the wildlife we have around the neighborhood such as deer, fox and 
other animals.  The noise from the vehicles on I-295 is very loud, and adding a 
constant stream of people walking by my house is an outright invasion of privacy and 
property.  The home values of the abutting residences to the trail will go down in 
value as the trail will be a huge detriment when it comes time to sell the abutting 
houses.  It's a question of respecting the people's rights who live on the abutting 
property.  I'm 73 years old and don't want to have to worry about people stealing my 
belongings I have in my yard including ladders, wheelbarrows, helping themselves to 
flowers/vegetables in my gardens, etc.  There are plenty of other trails in Maine for 
people to use. How many existing trails are being used now?  I respectfully ask you to
oppose LD406.  Thank you, Regina Furrer
