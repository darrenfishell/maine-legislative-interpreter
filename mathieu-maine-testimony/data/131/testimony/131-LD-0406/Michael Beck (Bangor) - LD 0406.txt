Dear Honorable Members of the Committee on Transportation,
I am writing to express my strong support for the expansion of passenger rail in the 
state of Maine. As a husband and a father of four children, travel can often be difficult
for my family, especially when we have only one car available.
I strongly believe that the expansion of passenger rail in Maine would be of major 
benefit to not just my family, but to countless other families in the state. With the 
availability of reliable and affordable rail travel, families like mine would have the 
opportunity to explore more of Maine together.  It would also help take away the 
stress of juggling the use of our family vehicle when my wife or I have to travel 
elsewhere in the state for work or other events.
Additionally, expanding passenger rail would also help to alleviate traffic congestion 
on the state's highways, reducing the time and stress associated with long commutes. 
This, in turn, would improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions, which would 
benefit not only our families but also the environment as a whole.
I urge you to consider the benefits of expanding passenger rail in Maine, not only for 
families like mine but for the state as a whole. I hope that you will take this 
opportunity to invest in the future of Maine and support this important initiative.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Michael Beck
Bangor, Maine
