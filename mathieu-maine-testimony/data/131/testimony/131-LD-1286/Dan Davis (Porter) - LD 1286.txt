LD 1286
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and members of the IDEAB Committee:
I represent no agency or entity and write in opposition to LD1286.
Sure, Maine has supported aquaculture for a long time, but it is okay to pause when 
we realize we did not consider the gross scale of these enterprises and the negative 
impacts they have on our water systems, communities, and ecology.
There is such a thing as ''too big to control'', we need to take a step back and decide 
what is a reasonable scale for Maine where the government is no co-opted or pushed 
around by the powerful interests in our water. We've already allowed ourselves to be 
manipulated and controlled by one water industry, largely because of our lax conflict 
of interest/financial disclosure laws.
One company controls 97% of the water bottling market in Maine and fills rooms 
with lawyers to bully and intimidate, and sways influential boards with compromised 
individuals whenever water restriction is discussed or more profit and less risk is 
wanted by the parent corporation. We have no political will to control this monopolist
and to ultimately do our jobs protecting the best interests of all Mainers.
Aren't we supposed to be learning from our mistakes and making positive adjustments
before jumping into another potential long-term subversion of Maine sovereignty by 
allowing operations that exceed our capacity and capability to manage them? 
Please pause and vote ought not to pass on this bill. Sounds great, but the devil is in 
the details.
Thanks,
Dan
