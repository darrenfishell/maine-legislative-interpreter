In what sense is creating a mechanism for handing Maine's freshwater supply over to 
private capital an emergency?
This dangerous piece of legislation needs to be thoroughly considered -- by the 
public, whom you represent -- before proceeding. Please vote "ought NOT to pass" 
and let the bill go through the normal channels for consideration of how it might 
impact Maine now and in the future.
