I do not understand the emergency nature of this legislation. Of course we all want a 
vibrant economy in Maine, but not at the expense of our natural resources. Our water 
and rural communities need protection from "green" money interests. This issue needs
much more time, research and community input. I urge you to postpone a vote on this 
legislation.
