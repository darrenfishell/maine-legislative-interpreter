Winnegance Oyster Farm
LD 1286
I am writing to support changes in LD 1286 to support the flourishing community of 
innovative, small-scale sea farms that make up a large part of the state’s aquaculture 
industry.
To do this, I propose that one of the two task force chairs in the aquaculture category 
should explicitly represent the small-scale, independent sea farms whose interests 
have largely been either ignored or actively opposed by industry lobbying over the 
last decade.
Doing this would acknowledge that innovation can come from Maine’s small-scale 
family farms, and not just the multinational operations pouring lobbying money into 
the state. Representation in blue economy planning will insure that there is a future 
here for businesses of all sizes and help will help protect one the few bright spots for 
small farms in the agriculture system as a whole.
