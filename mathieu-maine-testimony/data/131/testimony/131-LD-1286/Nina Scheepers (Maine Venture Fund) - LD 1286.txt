Testimony by Nina Scheepers 
Principal, Maine Venture Fund 
IN SUPPORT OF LD 1286 
Resolve, to Establish the Blue Economy Task Force to Support 
Maine's Emergence as a Center for Blue Economy Innovation and 
Opportunity in the 21st Century 
April 11, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Cuny, Representative Roberts, and Distinguished Members of the IDEA 
committee: 
My name is Nina Scheepers, and I am a Principal at the Small Enterprise Growth Fund, known 
as Maine Venture Fund, or “MVF” . I live in Topsham and am here to testify in support of LD 
1286. 
Maine Venture Fund invests in innovative Maine businesses to drive economic development and 
high-quality jobs in the state. Given Maine’s expansive coastline, quality maritime institutions, 
and long heritage of working with our ocean, we believe that Maine is well positioned to be 
leader in blue economy innovation. 
MVF has invested in several blue economy startups including American Unagi, Atlantic Sea 
Farms, BlueTrace, and True Fin. These businesses are building on Maine’s inherent attributes 
while irmovating new products and services to leverage and sustain Maine’s ocean resources. 
The Blue Economy task force proposed here will beneﬁt business like these by identifying 
infrastructure, workforce, and regulatory constraints, and setting a plan to improve those 
capabilities. 
We know that there is still work to be done to reﬁne the details of this bill, but by articulating a 
vision and setting a roadmap for Maine’s Blue Economy and proactively addressing 
opportunities and challenges, Maine can distinguish itself as a place with a robust blue economy 
ecosystem. This will continue to attract new entrepreneurs and investors and bolster existing 
businesses with additional support and funding. 
For these reasons I urge the Committee to vote unanimously ought to pass. Thank you for your 
time and attention, and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
