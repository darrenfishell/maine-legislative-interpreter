Although the concept of LD 1286 is very important for Maine’s 
economic future, there are fundamental problems with the charges to 
the proposed task force.  
1. The existing legal infrastructure in Maine on water rights, 
especially concerning Absolute Dominion or Absolute Capture, 
must be thoroughly evaluated by the task force. Especially in 
order to protect small communities and small businesses.  With 
“corporatization” of the state’s water by very large and influential 
organizations the rights and wellbeing of individual citizens, their 
communities and businesses are placed at great risk.   
2. Water usage, waste production, pesticide use, nitrogen and 
phosphorus load, spread of disease, and dissemination of 
potentially harmful genes into the wild populations must be 
specifically and  carefully evaluated for any endeavor under the 
auspices of the task force. 
Neglecting these fundamental issues will cause significant push back.  
Deliberately ignoring such obvious and basic problems will ultimately 
harm the development that LD 1286 intends promote. 
Thank you for your consideration.
