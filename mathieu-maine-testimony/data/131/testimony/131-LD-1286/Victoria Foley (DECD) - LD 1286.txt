TESTIMONY OF VICTORIA FOLEY, DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS & COMMUNICATIONS 
FOR THE MAINE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC & COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, REGARDING 
LD 1286, “RESOLVE, TO ESTABLISH THE BLUE ECONOMY TASK FORCE TO SUPPORT MAINE'S 
EMERGENCE AS A CENTER FOR BLUE ECONOMY INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY IN THE 
21ST CENTURY”  
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business  (IDEA), my 
name is Victoria Foley, and I am the Director of Legislative Affairs and Communications for 
DECD.  I am submitting this testimony neither for nor against Senator Duson’s Resolve, LD 1286, 
“To Establish the Blue Economy Task Force to Support Mai ne’s Emergence as a Center for Blue 
Economy Innovation and Opportunity in the 21st Century.”  
 
Senator Duson’s proposal calls for the creation of a 23 -person task force to develop a strategy 
and recommend a specific action plan to accelerate the State's emergence as an important 
contributor to the sustainable use of the ocean's resources for economi c health, improved 
livelihoods and jobs and ecosystem health, referred to the blue economy.  The strategy should 
identify the State's current and potential future opportunities and challenges in the blue 
economy.  
 
I think we can all agree that our economy  is heavily reliant on our ocean -based blue economy. 
We need to make every effort to ensure that we are tirelessly monitoring and assessing the 
challenges that may imperil it and the opportunities that will sustain and grow it.  While this 
proposal seeks t o tackle these issues, there is another effort currently underway that has been 
engaged in this effort since 2020.  The SEAMaine initiative is a $2.5 million federally funded  
effort to address many of the priorities in this Resolve.  It is an industry -led initiative that 
includes 30 -50 stakeholders from Maine’s commercial fishing, aquaculture, and seafood 
economy. The group is developing a “roadmap and action plan for economic growth, market 
and workforce development, and greater resiliency in Maine’s seafo od economy.”  Over the 
past three years, SEAMaine has generated a lot of data and reports  that are informing the final 
roadmap product.  They expect to complete the roadmap by the fall.  
 
SEAMaine’s project goals include creating economic growth and resiliency in Maine’s seafood 
economy by:  
  
Providing support to sustain Maine’s existing marine resource businesses by growing and 
diversifying markets for Maine seafood.  
Supporting the needs of today and the future of workforce in Maine’s marine economy

Attracting investment and talent in the seafood economy to support new technology  and 
product development in the sector.  
Strengthening Maine’s coastal communities through the preservation and improvements of our 
working waterfronts.  
Increasing the amount and value of marine living resources originating from Maine’s coastal 
waters in a way that minimizes the carbon footprint of the marine resource sector, increases 
competitiveness of Maine businesses, and maximizes resiliency and diversification  
  
While the proposed task force envisions some additional activities, we have some concern 
about a duplication of efforts.  Given that the SEAMaine roadmap is expected to be released 
this fall and will include a strategy and action plan as contemplated by this bill, we would 
respectfully ask that this legislation be carried over to the Second Regu lar Session so that the 
learnings from the three -plus-year SEAMaine effort can help inform any future task force that is 
created to assist Maine’s blue economy. This will help us all avoid the risk of duplication of 
effort s. The additional time provided by a carryover would also allow further discussion of the 
options for staffing such an effort, which would currently be a concern for the agencies 
identified.  
 
For your review, I would encourage you to visit the SEAMaine website at www.seamaine.org  to 
find out more information about the ongoing effort.  
  
Thank you for your time and consideration, I am happy to address any questions or concerns 
you may have.
