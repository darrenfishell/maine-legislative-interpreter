Senator
Curry ,
Representative
Roberts,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Innovation,
Development,

Advancement
and

I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portland’ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
Support
of
LD
1286,
Resolve,
to
Establish
the
Blue
Economy
T ask
Force
to
Support
Maine's
Emer gence
as
a
Center
for
Blue
Economy
Innovation
and
Opportunity
in
the
21st
Century .
Maine’ s
marine
industries
are
an
iconic
foundation
of
the
State’ s
economic
system.
Fishing,
aquaculture,
marine
transportation,
marine
construction,
boat
building,
and
vessel
repair
are
critical
to
both
Portland
and
coastal
Maine.
Emer ging
marine
industries
and
novel
applications
of
processes
in
the
marine
environment
hold
great
promise
to
expand
and
build
on
Maine’ s
maritime
heritage.
LD
1286’ s
intent
to
establish
a
body
with
the
broad
directive
to
concentrate
study
and
evaluation
on
identifying
opportunities,
constraints,
and
strategies
to
expand
the
footprint
of
these
opportunities
is
laudable
and
likely
overdue.
In
recognition
of
the
importance
and
potential
for
marine
industries,
the
work
of
the
proposed
task
force
expands
opportunities
to
grow
the
economy
needed
to
preserve
working
waterfronts
statewide.
Given
Portland’ s
commitment
to
preserving
the
working
waterfront,
expansion
of
new
industries
to
fill
space
and
retain
workforce
is
critical.
There
is
a
bright
future
in
our
Blue
Economy ,
and
we
must
take
the
necessary
steps
to
examine
how
Maine
can
be
a
leader
in
this
space.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
