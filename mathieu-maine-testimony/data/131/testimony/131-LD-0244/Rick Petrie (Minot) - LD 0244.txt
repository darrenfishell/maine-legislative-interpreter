Testimony in Support of LD 244
Resolve, Directing Maine Emergency Medical Services to Convene a 
Stakeholder Group to Explore Emergency Medical Services Career Pathways and 
Educational Opportunities in the State.
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe, Representative Salisbury and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee. My name is Rick Petrie, and I am a Paramedic 
who has worked in the Maine EMS system for 42 years. I am now the Chief Operations 
Officer for North East Mobile Health and Special Projects Advisor for Atlantic Partners 
EMS. Every EMS Service in Maine struggles every day with having enough staff to 
respond on 911 calls as well as provide non-emergency transport service to the citizens 
of, and visitors to, Maine.
I am here today to offer testimony in support of LD 244 because of the impact our 
current staffing shortage is having not only on our response times and capabilities, but 
also on the mental and physical well-being of our providers. Every day, we are seeing 
delays in 911 response times, a significant increase on an overtaxed mutual aid system, 
and an inability to move many patients to either receive care that they need or to relieve 
the pressure on our overcrowded hospitals. We have EMS providers who are routinely 
working 80–120 hours per week in an attempt to keep ambulances on the road, and 
going from one EMS job to another to keep the system functioning.   
We are in crisis mode, and we desperately need your help to rebuild the foundation of 
the EMS program in Maine. While there are multiple issues that need to be addressed, 
initiatives to increase our workforce must be one of the highest priorities.
 
When ambulance services can’t respond, emergency medical care to the people of 
Maine is negatively impacted. 
Thank you for your consideration, and I’ll answer any questions you may have.
Rick Petrie, EMT-P
