Testimony in Support of LD 244 a Resolve, Directing Maine Emergency 
Medical Services to Convene a Stakeholder Group to Explore Emergency 
Medical Services Career Pathways and Educational Opportunities in the 
State
Senator Beebe, Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of The 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. My name is 
William St. Michel, I am the retired Fire Chief of The Town of Durham and 
currently The Executive Director for Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association. Maine Fire 
Chiefs’ Association supports LD 244, a Resolve, Directing Maine Emergency 
Medical Services to Convene a Stakeholder Group to Explore emergency 
Medical Services Career Pathways and Educational Opportunities in the State.
The Fire Service is the largest group of EMS providers in the State. We struggle
with staffing and education. The lack of providers and the need to provide 
services to our communities creates an extremely unhealthy competitive 
situation. As the largest group of providers in the State, Maine Fire Chiefs’
Association feels we could offer valuable insight on the needs of Public EMS 
Agencies and therefore request an opportunity to be included in the list of
participants.
Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association would like to request your support in moving 
this important piece of Legislation, LD 244 forward. Thank you for your time!
Sincerely,
William St. Michel
