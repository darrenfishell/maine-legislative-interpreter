LD 59
Dear Health and Human Services Committee,
My name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China Village. I am writing today to ask 
you to oppose LD 59.
This affects me because it puts my health and my community's health at a higher risk. 
According to recent NPR reports, there are diseases making a reoccurrence due to 
rampant misinformation that led to people that think they can propose bills like this. - 
We thought we eradicated Polio- Nope! We thought we eradicated tetanus - we didn't.
We have the science and the tools to make diseases like this preventable - so kids can 
live long and happy lives to actually enjoy their childhood without sickly 
intermissions. The last thing I would want in my community is to see more children 
have a higher mortality rate and complications due to long covid. We're trying to get 
back to "normal" and kids who are not vaccinated don't have as consistent access to 
sports, or health programs because of frequent bouts of covid- where they are asked to
stay home. They won't be able to enjoy their childhood as much, compared to kids 
that are vaccinated - because that's what sickness does. So why let our children have a
higher risk of getting sicker than we were, when it could be entirely preventable. We 
also don't have health systems or infrastructure in place - to support the outcome of 
kids that don't get these vaccines. We still haven't financially survived Covid.  The 
preventive measures are all we have - and until then - it does not make sense to leave 
it out of the universal childhood immunization program. 
So oppose LD 59.
