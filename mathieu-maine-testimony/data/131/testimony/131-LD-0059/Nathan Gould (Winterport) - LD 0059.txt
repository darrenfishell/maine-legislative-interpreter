Testimony in Support of LD 59
An Act to Prohibit Inclusion of the COVID-19 Vaccine in the Universal Childhood Immunization
Program 
and
LD 1382
An Act to Establish the Guiding Public Health Principles of Focused Protection for Pandemics of a
Highly Infectious Respiratory Disease 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:
My name is Nathan Gould. I am writing this testimony in support of LD 59, “ An Act to Prohibit 
Inclusion of the COVID-19 Vaccine in the Universal Childhood Immunization Program,”  LD 1382, “An 
Act to Establish the Guiding Public Health Principles of Focused Protection for Pandemics of a Highly 
Infectious Respiratory Disease.”
Our State’s COVID response reveals a need to rethink our response to pandemics, and issues 
with the COVID vaccine warrant more caution regarding to whom it should be given. Parents should 
be involved in making decisions in what vaccines their children take. Other countries do not require 
the COVID vaccination for those under 18-years of age. Please consider the importance of improving 
our response to pandemics and learning from past mistakes.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for reading this testimony.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
