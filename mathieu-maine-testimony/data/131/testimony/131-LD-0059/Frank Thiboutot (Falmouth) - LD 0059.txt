LD 59
I wholeheartedly support this bill for a multitude of reasons but, first and foremost is 
that another vaccine, especially one that has not had adequate testing, is completely 
unnecessary. Numerous studies have shown that children are not affected by the 
COVID-19 virus unless there are underlying health conditions. I urge the members of 
the Committee to vote “Ought to Pass” for LD 59.
