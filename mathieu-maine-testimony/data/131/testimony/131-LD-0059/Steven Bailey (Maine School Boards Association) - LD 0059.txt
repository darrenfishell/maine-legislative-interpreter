TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 59  
 
AN ACT TO PROHIBIT I NCLUSION OF THE COVID -19 VACCINE IN THE 
UNIVERSAL CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Committee on Health 
and Human Services. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine School 
Boards Association, submitting testimony on behalf of the legislative committee of 
the Maine School Boards Association, in opposition to L.D. 59.  
 
School Boards are obligated to adopt policies that are in the best interest of staff 
and the students we serve. That obligation includes requiring students to have ap-
propriate vaccines to protect them and their fellow classmates and teachers.  
 
COVID shots are not part of the required vaccine program for public school at-
tendance, which does require shots for Polio, measles, mumps and rubella, chick-
enpox and diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough.  
 
That said, School Boards are opposed to L.D. 59 because it proactively excludes a 
COVID -19 vaccine at a time when we don ’t know what the future holds for the 
trajectory of this disease or the potential increased effectiveness of vaccine.  
 
Our position in is line with our responsibility to keep students in our care safe.
