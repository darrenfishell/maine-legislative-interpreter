LD 59
Dear Members of the Health and Human services Committee, 
I am writing in regards to ~ LD 59: "An Act to Prohibit Inclusion of the COVID-19 
Vaccine in the Universal Childhood Immunization Program"
I am urging "ought to pass" since we know now and it has been proven that there is 
no efficacy with the covid 19 shots, and in fact they have been proven to be very 
dangerous.  Bodily autonomy is a right given to us by our Creator and should not be 
stolen by those promoting mandates. 
Please vote ought to pass on LD 59
