As a healthcare worker and former immuno scientist and as a mother, I speak for the 
safety of our State's children as well as my own that the Covid-19 vaccines have not 
had critical long-term validation, nor unbiased review by pediatricians to classify the 
vaccines as being safe to add to the universal childhood immunization program.
We must be thorough in our analysis and thought processes, not reactive, to what the 
children in our State have (physically) endured, their (physiological) resilience, as 
well as what we (medically) require of them.
