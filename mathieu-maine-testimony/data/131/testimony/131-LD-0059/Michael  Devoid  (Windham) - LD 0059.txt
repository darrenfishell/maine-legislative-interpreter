There is no real evidence these vaccines do anything and the evidence actually 
supports that these "vaccines" for covid actually do more harm and injure more under 
35 then they actually help. I am 37 years old and forced to take these for my job and 
now have permanent damage to liver and blood work that sky rocketed. I had blood 
work every year prior all very similar 2 months after the shot and continuously feeling
tired blood work was 10x higher then ever before. Not all medication works the same 
on everyone. No body should be forced to take anything. This is supposed to be a free
country, government or employer should not have the ability to inject what ever they 
want.
