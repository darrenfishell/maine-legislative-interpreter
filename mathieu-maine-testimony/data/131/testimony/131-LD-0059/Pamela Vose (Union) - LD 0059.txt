Pamela Vose
Union
LD 59
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident of Union, Maine.   I am writing in 
opposition to LD 59.  Vaccines are safe and are a necessary part of keeping all 
citizens in our state healthy.    Giving in to pseudo science in the name of political 
gain is putting all of us at risk.   I urge you to vote ought not to pass on this misguided
bill.
