Immunization Program 
 
Memorandum of Support  
Date:  April 24, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Veterans and Legal Affairs  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 59 - An Act to Prohibit Inclusion of the COVID-19 Vaccine in the Universal Childhood Immunization 
Program 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 59 - An Act to Prohibit Inclusion of the 
COVID-19 Vaccine in the Universal Childhood Immunization Program. 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell from Sanford. 
 
As you may be aware, the COVID vaccine has been shown to not provide immunity to COVID or provide any 
significant benefit. Studies are also showing other negative side effects such as increased rates of myocarditis, 
and other uncommon conditions.  
 
Second, the death rate from COVID-19 in children is non existent, outside severe comorbidities.    
 
Please support this bill as children do not need this vaccine, and will likely cause harm in the long run. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
