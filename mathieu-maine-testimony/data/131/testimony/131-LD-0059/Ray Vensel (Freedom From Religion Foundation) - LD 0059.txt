LD 59 
 
Members of the Health and Human Services Committee, this is testimony AGAINST LD 59.  
LD 59 directly endangers the public health and makes more deaths from disease inevitable.  
Specifically eliminating COVID-19 from the list of vaccines is contrary to accepted science and 
introduces an unnecessary barrier to preventing the quick spread of a highly contagious disease 
among young schoolchildren and their circles of family and friends. Specifically eliminating 
COVID-19 also seems to label this as a political issue and not one of public health.  
The needs of public health demand that there be no barriers to the administration of vaccines, 
especially for children, immuno-compromised, and other vulnerable segments of the population.  
Vaccines help to prevent deaths.  
Please protect public health, and donâ€™t let this bill pass. Thank you.
