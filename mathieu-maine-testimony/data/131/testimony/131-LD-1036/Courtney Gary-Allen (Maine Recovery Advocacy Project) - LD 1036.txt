Good Afternoon Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salizbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice & Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Courtney Gary-Allen. I am the Organizing Director of the Maine Recovery 
Advocacy Project, a grassroots network of advocates, elected officials, and organizations 
working on community and public policy based solutions to substance use in Maine amid the 
skyrocketing overdose epidemic. I am here today to testify on behalf of our network in favor of 
LD lO36: An Act to Require All Police Officers to Carry Naloxone Hydrochloride When on 
Duty. 
Your committee does not need me to stand before you and read a list of statistics about the 
number of people who died from an overdose last year. You know. I imagine many of you know 
personally and if not, you’ve seen it in the news. 
In our eyes, LD 1036 is a very simple task. It's an ask that Maines first responders have what 
they need on them to respond to an overdose when the moment comes. We are actually going to 
request that your committee consider going a bit further with this proposed legislation by 
requiring that correctional officers also carry Naloxone throughout the county jails and state 
prison systems. 
Over the course of the last few years more and more 
Mainers have been dying inside our correctional facilities, 
so many so that reporters at 8 Investigates felt it necessary 
to do a months-long reporting effort to provide 
never-before-seen insight into how people are dying inside 
Maine’s jails and prisons? It was found that since 2019, at 
least 8 people have died from an accidental overdose ina 
Maine Jail or State Prison. That doesn’t even account fora 
more recent death inside Penobscot County J ail? D!!! ol.

One death it does account for is a death in Cumberland County Jail. Since that time Sheriff Joyce 
has taken it upon himself to change the jails policy and ensure that all staff members have 
Naloxone on their belt at all times, as announced last week.3

I know there are some concerns about how police departments or a correctional facility would 
pay for the Naloxone or required training. I think there is a very simple answer to that too. The 
State of Maine already purchases and distributes Naloxone through their Tier system. Governor 
Mills has already included an increased budget line to purchase more Naloxone this year. The 
Police Ofﬁcers and Correctional Facilities would have access to that Naloxone, furthermore there 
are countless organizations that provide training on Naloxone administration for free. 
Ensuring that our police ofﬁcers and correctional officers have access to this life saving 
medication is a simple way to help save lives on the front lines of the opioid crisis. I hope your 
committee Will vote to pass and consider my suggestion for an amendment to the bill. Thank you 
for your time. I’m happy to answer any questions. 
Sincerely, 
Courteny Gary-Allen
