Sen. Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury and distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I providing testimony neither for nor against LD 
1036, An Act to Require All Police Officers to Carry Naloxone Hydrochloride When on Duty, on behalf of 
the Maine Municipal Association, which represents the interests of municipal government before the 
Legislature. The positions of the Association are established by our 70-member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC), who are elected by the councils and selectboards of municipalities in each of Maineâ€™s 
35 Senate districts.
Under current law, law enforcement agencies that have routine interactions with individuals 
suffering from overdose situations have developed appropriate and locally supported policy to carry and 
administer naloxone hydrochloride. In some communities, this type of medicine is administered 
specifically in conjunction with emergency medical services who are well equipped not only to have 
additional supplies of the drug readily on hand, but also posses the ability to appropriately store the drug, 
and monitor and record additional uses. Changes to this law will create a mandate exclusively for law 
enforcement instead of the EMS system, and the bill will require the mandate preamble, but in general, 
officials believe this medicine should be available broadly and hope the committee will support that 
expenditure as part of this initiative.
Officials feel the current process works well because it manages finite and expendable resources 
in balance with the predictable need and protection of public investment. Because this bill seems to 
require the officer and not the agency to be the carrier of such material, it is unclear how this will work in 
services that have rescue on hand for its administration currently, without creating redundance or 
potential waste and shortages in the supply system shortages where it might not be appropriate. Naloxone 
is a medicine that requires temperature stability, not a uniform reality for the duties of police, particularly 
in rural locations where long hours may be spent in freezing or high heat conditions and a great distance 
from additional supplies. Often it requires more than one dose and is most appropriately managed with 
greater emergency medical supports nearby.  Rather than requiring each individual officer to carry the 
material, it may be more beneficial to direct and require the law enforcement agency to develop a plan for 
naloxone to be readily available for law enforcement and in consultation with the other available services 
to insure the appropriate supply and storage of the drug. 
In some states, like Connecticut, the EMS system has invested in an early warning system for 
overdose events that use increased emergency calls for naloxone as an indicator of dangerous supplies of 
fentanyl laced supplies often rolling up the I-95 corridor. Such crowdsourced information has better 
prepared hospitals and rescue services to source appropriate supplies and staffing resources to address the 
events and hopefully render them less deadly. Officials hope that you will also explore ways support the 
immediate sharing of information about overdose incidents where naloxone is administered to allow 
emergency services to be better prepared statewide which will also help with the management of the drug 
and concentrate the availability in the greatest area of need.
