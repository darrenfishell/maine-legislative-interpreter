An Act to Require All Police Ofﬁcers to Carry Naloxone Hydrochloride When on Duty 
. Sponsored by Representative Milliken 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and other distinguished members of the joint standing 
committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. My name is Major Scott Gosselin and I am here to 
represent the Maine State Police and the Maine Department of Public Safety to testify in support of LD 1036, 
“An Act To Require All Police Ofﬁcers to Carry Naloxone Hydrochloride When on Duty.” 
According to the Governor ’ s Overdose Report, 10,110 overdoses were reported in Maine in 2022, including 
716 suspected or conﬁrmed deaths, for a survival rate over the year of nearly 93 percent. Nearly 80 percent 
of conﬁrmed fatal drug overdoses in 2022, according to the report, are attributable to highly lethal non- 
pharmaceutical fentanyl, either used on its own or in combination with other illicit drugs, such as cocaine, 
heroin, or methamphetamine. As outlined in this report from the Governor ’s Ofﬁce, 716 fatal overdoses isa 
grim reminder that we still have a lot more work to do to combat the drug problem in our State and try and 
help save those afﬂicted with substance abuse disorder. 
During 2022, law enforcement ofﬁcers responded to a reported 2,138 drug overdose incidents (667 fatal; 
1,471 nonfatal) and Maine EMS responded to a reported 9,773 incidents (579 fatal; 9,194 nonfatal). In 2022 
based on the data available law enforcement reported successfully reversed a drug over-dose 73 times. 
Those are 73 people who but for law enforcement and their carrying of Narcan would not be alive today. 
Those people are mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, family and close friends. 
Starting in 2016, the Ofﬁce of the Maine Attorney General began purchasing kits of intranasal Narcan to be 
distributed to law enforcement agencies throughout the state of Maine to be used during emergency 
response calls to save the lives of people experiencing overdoses. Since then, multiple opioid overdose 
reversals by law enforcement were reported to the Maine Naloxone Distribution Initiative from the Law 
Enforcement Naloxone Distribution Program. There have been multiple occasions in Maine where having 
responding law enforcement officers equipped with Narcan has literally meant the difference between life 
and death.

A law enforcement ofﬁcer’ s fundamental duty is to protect people and help save lives. There is no reasona 
person suffering an overdose should die because a police ofﬁcer did not have this simple tool available. 
As this particular matter relates to the Maine State Police, our uniformed ofﬁcers and patrol units have been 
carrying NARCAN since 2016. We have also had this tool available in our specialty units such as the Crime 
Laboratory and Computer Crimes Units just in case their examination of evidence leads to an unexpected 
exposure. We do have some logistical concerns with this bill which may also impact other agencies. For 
example, due to the potency and market prevalence of today’s opioids, law enforcement ofﬁcers are 
routinely having to administer multiple doses of NARCAN per person to revive them. Also, it is not Lmheard 
of for a police ofﬁcer to respond to multiple overdoses during one shift. This means that law enforcement 
ofﬁcers may have to return to their station or department to resupply. It is important that this bill 
considers the logistics necessary ensure a continual supply is readily available. 
On behalf of the State Police and the Department of Public Safety we appreciate your careful consideration 
of these issues. Thank you for your time and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. 
Respectfully, 
Major Gosselin
