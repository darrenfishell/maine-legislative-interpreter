LD 1818
My name is David Boyer. I am a member of Third Act Maine, an organization of 
people over 60, in the 'third act' of our lives, who are devoted to aiding the transition 
to a renewable energy system. 
This transition must occur soon if we are to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement 
and keep the earth's temperature from increasing more than 1.5 degrees centigrade 
above the average at the beginning of the industrial era. Further destabilization of the 
climate will seriously erode the chances of those in the 'first act' of their lives (our 
grandchildren) to enjoy economic or social security.
I am writing in support of LD 1818. Passage of this bill is essential to the speediest 
possible transition to a renewable energy system. While solar may remain the largest 
clean energy sector, it is imperative that wind power be fully implemented as well. 
Our state is blessed with off-shore wind as a clean, ever renewed resource. This bill 
will provide good jobs and support a just transition to a decarbonized economy.
