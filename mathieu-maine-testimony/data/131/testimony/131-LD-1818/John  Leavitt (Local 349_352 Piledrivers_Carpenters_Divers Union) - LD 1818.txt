Good Afternoon  
Senate Chair Tipping, Representative Chair Roeder, and members of the Labor and Housing Committee, 
Thank you for hearing this extremely important bill.  
 
Offshore Wind is a global market and State of Maine is a desired location for many offshore wind developers to 
grow. With your help we have an opportunity to establish working guidelines in a new industry that could 
support working people and their families for many decades.  
 
As you see many trades, businesses, and communities have worked together to present this bill which represents 
the families of your constituents who will be directly impacted on how these projects are outlined.  
 
LD 1818 falls in line with the Governors Offshore Wind Roadmap and provides long term careers for the 
working people in Maine stemming from the research array which is being engineered with the University of 
Maine Orono campus. This bill includes the need for training a diverse workforce for long-term careers while 
protecting inland fisheries, wildlife, and accounting for port upgrades that work within the community directly 
affected.  
 
The ultimate benefit to the people of Maine is offshore wind turbines will provide a much-needed alternative 
energy source that is safe for our families and will provide a less oil dependent community while offering an 
economic boost.  
 
I am happy to answer any questions and I urge you to support LD 1818 as written and I thank you for your time 
and consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
John Leavitt

Please find my written testimony in support of LD 1818. I apologies I am unable to 
attend in person due to shoulder surgery.
I am happy to attend any workshops or answer any questions the committee may 
have.
Thank you for this opportunity.
