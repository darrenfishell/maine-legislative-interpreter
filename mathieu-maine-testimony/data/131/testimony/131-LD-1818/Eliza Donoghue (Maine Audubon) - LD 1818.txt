RE:

An

Offshor e
W ind
Power
Pr ojects
Dear
Senator
T ipping,
Representative
Roeder ,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1818,
An
Act
Regarding
Port
Facilities
Relating
to
Of fshore
W ind
Power
Projects
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
Maine
Audubon
is
a
strong
supporter
of
of fshore
wind
development
in
the
Gulf
of
Maine
as
a
leading
strategy
for
Maine
to
achieve
its
climate
and
clean
ener gy
goals.
The
potential
for
of fshore
wind
ener gy
development,
specifically
using
floating
technology ,
is
far
greater
than
any
other
renewable
ener gy
source
–
an
estimated
156
gigawatts
of
ener gy
per
year ,
more
than
70
times
the
amount
of
electricity
used
by
the
entire
state
of
Maine.
As
a
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat
conservation
or ganization,
our
staf f
biologists
and
policy
team
are
actively
understanding,
researching,
and
pursuing
strategies
to
ensure
that
all
reasonable
ef forts
are
made
to
avoid,
minimize,
and
mitigate
impacts
from
of fshore
wind
development
on
the
Gulf
of
Maine
environment.
W e’re
also
pursuing
strategies
to
ensure
Maine
people
benefit
from
this
new
development.
LD
1818
is
such
a
strategy .
LD
1818
sets
a
critical
foundation
for
catalyzing
a
responsible
of fshore
wind
industry
in
Maine.
The
bill
sets
strong
standards
for
port
facilities
that
are
necessary
for
building
of fshore
wind
at
scale
and
puts
Maine
in
a
strong
position
to
secure
the
permits
and
federal
funding
to
build
–
using
skilled,
Maine
workers
–
such
facilities.
Building
a
purpose-built
of fshore
wind
port
in
Maine
is
essential
to
Maine
realizing
the
full
economic
benefit
of
of fshore
wind
development
in
the
Gulf
of
Maine
and
beyond.
This
bill
supports
and
enhances
such
development
through
permitting
measures,
as
well
as
the
requirement
that
state
agencies
pursue
federal
funds
to
enhance
climate
resilience
and
the
biodiversity
of
any
nearshore,
intertidal,
or
upland
areas
disturbed
by
port
development.
Maine
Audubon
strongly
supports
this
legislation
and
we
encourage
the
Committee
to
do
the
same.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
our
testimony .

Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
