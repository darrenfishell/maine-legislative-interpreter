Committed to stoppin new fossil fuel projects and investments 
Chairperson Representative Roeder, Chairperson Senator Tipping and esteemed 
members of the Housing and Labor Committee, l strongly support LD 1818. 
My name is Renee Givner. lam on the Legislative Committee of Third Act Maine. We area 
climate action group of people over age 60 whose goal is to pressure the largest banks in the 
country to stop funding new fossil fuel projects and start being serious about funding 
renewable energy. We are part of the national Third Act organization. Our age group holdsa 
good percentage of the investments in this country so we are hoping we can influence the 
divestment of new fossil fuel projects. The climate does not look promising for our children 
and grandchildren unless we can keep carbon emissions down to levels consistent with the 
lPCC's target. Third Act Maine supports LD 1818 for it's good paying clean energyjobs which are 
vital for Maine's offshore wind energy projects. 
The inflation Reduction Act champions transition to a clean energy economy. Fortunately, at 
the state level, unlike the US Congress, clean energy producers are not all about party 
affiliation. Texas, lowa, Kansas, Oklahoma & lllinois are the biggest producers of wind energy. 
The biggest producers of solar energy are California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and 
Arizona. Solar energy is now the cheapest energy to produce. We have come a long way in the 
last 10 years. Now the goal is to keep fossil fuels in the ground as much as possible. 
Maine can be a leader in clean energy, particularly off-shore wind installations, by providing 
high paying clean energyjobs equitably. it is a win-win. lam counting on it for our kids and our 
grandchildren. Thank you for this important work.
