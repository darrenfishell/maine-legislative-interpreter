LD 1818
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing, my name is Carly Baker, I live in Roxbury and 
I’m submitting this testimony today in favor of LD 1818.
I will be graduating from high school in less than a month. I plan to attend Bates 
College. I am happy to be staying in Maine, the state that has been my home for 
nearly the past six years. I love this state and I wish more of my peers had the option 
to stay in the state. I hope to be able to find a job here in Maine after I graduate from 
college in 2027.
Unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone. So many of my classmates will leave 
Maine and not return. They do this because we do not have good paying jobs 
available to them. If our state wants to keep young people in the state, we need to 
invest in policies that create more good paying jobs for people in all fields of work. 
LD 1818 moves us towards that vision by taking steps towards ensuring good wages 
are paid to jobs at future offshore wind port facilities.
I recently turned eighteen and I’m about to graduate high school. This is an important 
time in my life and I am thinking about my future. But, what future exists for me as 
we deal with climate change? Many of my generation, myself included, are concerned
about our climate and the future of our state and nation. We need to support 
legislation that moves us more toward a climate-friendly future. This bill does this.
Please join me in supporting LD 1818 and invest in Maine’s future. Thank you.
