Third Act Maine
LD 1818
Chairperson Representative Roeder, Chairperson Senator Tipping and esteemed 
members of the Housing and Labor Committee, I am submitting this testimony in 
support of LD1818. This important bill represents the first step in reducing Maine's 
dependence on fossil fuels for electric power. It confirms the fact that the switch to 
alternative, clean energy will mean good union jobs for Maine's citizens. 
I am co facilitator of Maine Third Act, a volunteer organization of Mainers over 60 
working to end our dependence on fossil fuels. Recent reports by the International 
Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have warned that
all new investment in fossil fuel exploration and infrastructure must stop now if we 
are to avoid the potential catastrophic effects of climate change. 
Maine's wind power development is one important step in making investments in the 
fossil fuel industry less attractive. Wind energy will provide cheaper, more 
dependable power that will not be subject to the price instability of fossil fuels and the
undue influence of the world's worst actors, Russia and Saudi Arabia. 
Maine Third Act fully supports LD1818.
