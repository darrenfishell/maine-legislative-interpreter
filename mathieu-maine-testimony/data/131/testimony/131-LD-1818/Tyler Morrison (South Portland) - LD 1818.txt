Testimony from Tyler Morrison, in Support of L.D. 1818, "An Act Regarding Port 
Facilities Relating to Offshore Wind Power Projects‚Äù
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing, My name is Tyler Morrsion and I am a resident of 
South Portland and member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters local 352. I am 
speaking in favor of LD 1818.
I have been a member of the Carpenters Union since 2008 and can sincerely say my 
life is better as a result of being a union member. This bill is important to me because 
it means not just creating jobs to pay the bills but jobs that create a real path to the 
middle class. AS my career progressed I saw my life improve from living at home to 
being able to afford my own apartment and eventually to home ownership. As my 
career progressed so did my family life and due to my negotiated health insurance I 
have always been able to take care of my wife and two daughters.
Being able to provide a good life for my family now is important but I also support 
this bill knowing I am supporting a good future for my daughters as well. The threat 
posed by climate change is real and Green Energy provided by offshore wind is a way
to ensure a promising and prosperous future.
Thank you, and please support LD 1818
