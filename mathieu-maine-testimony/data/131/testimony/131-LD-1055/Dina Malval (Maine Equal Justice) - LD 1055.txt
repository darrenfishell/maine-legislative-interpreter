MEJ Testimony in Opposition to LD 1055, An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop 
Boxes 
March 22, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans 
and Legal Affairs Committee. My name is Dina Malual, I use she/her pronouns, and I’m 
a Policy Advocate with Maine Equal Justice, a nonproﬁt legal aid provider working to 
increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine. I am testifying 
in opposition to LD 1055. 
Voting is a civil right that Maine Equal Justice continues to protect. With continuous high 
voter turnout, we support maintaining different methods of voting in the state of Maine 
that are accessible to all eligible voters. LD 1055 would make voting more difﬁcult by 
scaling back access to drop boxes for returning absentee ballots. 
In recent years there have been many efforts to make voting difficult and turn eligible 
voters away. By prohibiting ballot boxes we inevitably make it harder for vulnerable 
voters to exercise their civil rights. Low-income Mainers are often most harmed by 
restrictions to voting access. Those working multiple jobs or irregular shifts with little 
ﬂexibility can struggle to make it to their town or city hall during nonnal business hours. 
Students, single parents, immunocompromised people, and people without reliable 
transportation can all beneﬁt from drop boxes because they are available at any time of 
the day and do not require waiting in lines. 
Maine consistently has one of the highest voter participation rates in the nation, and in the 
2022 midterm election, 75% of registered Maine voters voted? This speaks to our state’s 
commitment to civic engagement and ensuring multiple methods to access voting so we 
can meet the needs of voters. By allowing residents to choose their p1‘6f€1‘I‘€(l method of 
voting, we can continue to see high voter turnout. Reducing access, like LD 1055 seeks to

do, will disenfranchise voters who experience the greatest challenges with participating 
due to Work, child care, health challenges, disabilities, or lack of reliable transportation? 
At Maine Equal Justice we are deeply committed to protecting voter rights. Ballot drop 
boxes are essential to maintaining an equitable Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to 
share our thoughts with you today. We urge the committee to vote Ought Not To Pass on 
LD 1055.
