LD 1055 An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes
Testimony:  OUGHT NOT TO PASS
I strongly oppose this legislation.  The American democratic process depends on free, fair, accessible 
elections.  Local municipalities and state elections commissions set the guidelines for the voting period, 
voting place, poll times and designation of voting booths.  The current legislation for drop boxes is even 
more explicit as to the number and location of drop boxes, accessible design, monitoring, labeling, use 
and retrieval by designated municipal officials.  
Secure, locked, ballot drop boxes have proven to enfranchise all voters during local, state and federal 
elections.  No evidence has been presented that challenged the security of this system in the 2020 or 2022 
elections or justifies the need to eliminate drop boxes.
Secure, locked ballot drop boxes accommodate voters including:
Voters who work unconventional hours that prohibit them from voting in person
Voters who have compromising health conditions requiring special protection
Voters who are disabled requiring access and additional time to submit a ballot
Voters without transportation 
I therefore, ask that the committee report this bill as OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
