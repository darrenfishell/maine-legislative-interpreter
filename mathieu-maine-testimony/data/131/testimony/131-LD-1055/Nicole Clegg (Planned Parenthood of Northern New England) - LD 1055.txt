Sena tor Hickman, R epresen tative Supic a  and member s of the Join t Standing Commit tee onVeterans and Leg al Af fairs, my name is Nic ole Cleg g and I ser ve as the Acting CE O at PlannedParenthood of Northern Ne w England and I am pleased t o submit t estimon y in opposition t o LD1055
Planned P arenthood of Northern Ne w England pr ovides c ompr ehensiv e reproductiv e and se xualhealth c are to mor e than 14,000 people in Maine a t four health cen ters loc ated in Bidde ford,Portland, San ford and T opsham. P eople turn t o us f or affordable, high-quality c are includingwellness e xams, birth c ontrol, disease t esting and tr eatmen t, cancer scr eenings, abortion c areas w ell as a v ariety of primar y care ser vices. W e see e veryone who c omes t o us r egardless ofability t o pa y, and in a typic al year, we provide mor e than $4 million in fr ee and disc ounted careto our c ommunities in Maine.
As a mission driv en health c are provider , we fundamen tally belie ve everyone should be able t oget affordable, high quality se xual and r eproductiv e health c are in their c ommunities, no ma tterwher e the y live or ho w much mone y the y mak e and w e adv ocate for policies tha t help mak ethis vision a r eality .
As a healthc are provider which oft en w orks with mar ginaliz ed popula tions w e are incr ediblytroubled b y the onslaugh t of pr oposals be fore this c ommit tee to restrict access t o votingwhe ther it be thr ough the imposition of V oter ID , restriction of access t o ab sentee ballots, or asis the c ase f or LD 1055 curt ailing means b y which a Mainer c an return their ballot.
Maine is blessed with a deeply r ooted commitmen t to the elect oral pr ocess, a c ommitmen treflect ed in our s tate’s laws around v oting which ha ve continually pr ogressed in or der t o expandaccess and allo w mor e eligible Mainer s to exercise their fundamen tal righ t to vote. Fr om sameday registration t o in-per son ab sentee voting t o ballot dr op bo xes, Maine’ s election la ws haveevolved to mee t the challeng es of the 21s t cen tury and r esult ed in v oter turnout r ates tha t areconsis tently among the highes t in the na tion.
Though man y Mainer s enjo y casting their ballots a t the polls on Election Da y, other s prefer todo so fr om the sa fety and c onvenience of their o wn homes. F or Mainer s who choose t o voteabsentee, dr op bo xes of fer a sa fe, secur e and c onvenien t option t o return their ballots withoutrequiring a visit their t own of fice during s tandar d working hour s or being f orced acc ount entrusttheir v ote to a pos tal ser vice which suf fered fr om incr eased dela ys and spor adic mail deliv eryoutages the las t two election cy cles.
If the g oal of this pr oposal is t o strengthen Maine’ s already sa fe and secur e elections, I ur ge theLegisla ture to ins tead w ork t o expand access t o ong oing ab sentee voting , incr ease support f orelection w orkers, and pr ovide additional funding f or state and loc al election adminis trators tohave suf ficien t trained s taff as w ell as implemen ting other upda tes to moderniz e our electionsand elections in frastructur e.
In closing , a pr ohibition on dr op bo xes w ould be a s tep backw ards for voter access in Maine. Iurge you to vote not t o pass LD 1055.
