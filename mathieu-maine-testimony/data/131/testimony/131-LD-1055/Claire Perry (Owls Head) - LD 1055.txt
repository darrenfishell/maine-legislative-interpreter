LD 1055
Dear Committee members,
I am writing in opposition to LD 1055
Ballot Drop Boxes are one of the best and most secure ways for a busy person to vote.
Since some mistrust the postal service and others find it hard to accommodate the 
OPEN/CLOSED hours of their town office, this is a very convenient and sensible 
option for them.  
I believe the more we can safely enable those who want to vote, but aren't always 
able, the better. I have seen two of these boxes set outside town offices in my area, 
they look extremely secure, sturdy and safe. They have worked well in the past and I 
do not understand the angst others seem to have of them. Again, the more safe and 
secure options we can afford our citizens to vote; the better.
