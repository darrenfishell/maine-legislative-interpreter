Chair Hickman and Chair Supica and the distinguished members of the Committee on Veterans and 
Legal Affairs
My name is Shukri Abdirahman and I live in Lewiston, Maine. I am a Co-Director of Maine Youth Power,
a youth-led, youth movement throughout rural and suburban Maine ﬁghting to win human dignity,
equity and a livable future for all. I am here today to ask that you oppose LD 1055 An Act to Prohibit
the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes.
I believe American democracy depends on safeguarding our privilege/right to vote and having a fair
voting system for all who are eligible to vote. Voting should be easy access and people should be able
to vote as best for their circumstances. At my work with Maine Youth Power, we work to engage
young people in government. To protect our future as young Mainers I am strongly opposing this LD
1055 An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes. At Maine Youth Power, we believe and advocate
for making young people ﬁnd their power to actively participate in government. In our work we
believe Voting should not be more accessible for some Americans than others, and Maine laws like
same-day voter registration, absentee voting, and ballot drop boxes ensure eligible Mainers can cast
their ballot in a safe, secure way that works best for them. As we work towards a future where we are
ﬁghting to win human dignity, equity, and a liveable future for all.
As long as people are eligible to vote, they should be able to practice that right. But now we have
some politicians who threaten our right to vote and work to create barriers that move us away from
democracy and protect our rights as we are the people.
I urge you to OPPOSE LD 1055 An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes.
Thank you for listening,
Shukri Abdirahman
