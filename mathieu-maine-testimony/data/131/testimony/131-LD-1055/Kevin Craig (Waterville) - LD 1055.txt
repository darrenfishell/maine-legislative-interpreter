Chair Hickman and Chair Supica and the distinguished members of the Committee on Veterans and Legal 
Affairs 
Good morning, my name is Kevin Craig, and I live in Waterville, Maine. I work with Maine Youth Power and 
advocacy groups on Colby College's campus. l am here today in opposition of LD 1055: An Act to Prohibit 
the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes. 
Voting is the fundamental mechanism for creating a healthy democracy. That's why Maine is a shining 
beacon of democracy. ln the 2022 midterm election, 75% of‘ the 904,674 Mainers’ registered to vote in 
that election, 28%, or nearly @,_0_0ﬂ‘ llainers voted via absentee ballot. By banning ballot drop boxes, 
this legislation, through lines 1-1» on page 3 would eliminate a third of the options that Mainers have to 
return their absentee ballots. Should this bill pass, Mainers would be left with just mail or in-person 
returns of their absentee ballot.“ 
Maine's incredible voter participation comes from the intentional and varied means of accessing 
voting—incIuding the many ways to submit absentee ballots. Maine has safe, secure elections, with only 
two 2010 cases of voter fraud? ln fact, the text of this bill directly addresses the ways in which ballot drop 
boxes are safe: requirements that they be firmly affixed, monitored, and their ballots only retrievable by 
qualified personnel. 
If our election system and ballot drop boxes work, why seek to fix what is working? The answer is that this 
bill seeks to solve an invented problem to make voting harder. As a voter, l strongly urge you to not pass 
LD T055: An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes. 
Thank you for your consideration, 
Kevin Craig
