I've used the ballot drop box the last time I voted. I felt it was very secure. In fact, I 
trust it as much as a P.O. drop box. Please keep the drop box for voting. I want to 
make it easy for town clerks to get ballots, and easy for voters to return ballots at 
times when the town offices are not open. Thanks
