LD 1055
LD 1055 ought-TO-pass as it is an important measure in protecting the voting 
process. Absentee ballots are the best and safest method of voting early or as an 
alternative to on site voting.
This method of voting was enacted because of covid. It is time to return to the 
previous process.
Thank you.
