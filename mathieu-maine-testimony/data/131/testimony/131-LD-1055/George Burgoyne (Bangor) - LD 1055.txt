George Burgoyne

LD 1055
Greetings Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs, 
My name is George Burgoyne and I live in Bangor.  I am writing to urge this 
committee to vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 1055. I am a 76 year old retiree who has 
worked for many years as a Bangor election worker. I am very proud of the changes 
that have been enacted over the years towards the goal of making the act of voting 
more convenient and accessible. I believe that drop boxes have been a large and 
successful part of this effort.
I am also an active volunteer with AARP Maine, an organization that believes voting 
is a fundamental right. Options like absentee voting and the use of drop boxes 
expands access to voting. Laws around voting should encourage and promote 
participation, not limit it. Ballot drop boxes are an important tool that allow more 
Mainers to exercise their right to vote.   
I urge this committee to vote ought not to pass on this bill.
