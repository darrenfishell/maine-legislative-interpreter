LD 1055
Dear members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee,
I am Maya Faulstich and I’m with Maine Youth Power. I am writing to urge you to vote in 
opposition to LD 1055: An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes. Ballot boxes allow 
everyone to exercise our right to vote. As a sophomore in high school, in a few years, I’ll be 
allowed to vote, which I am very excited about. Banning ballot drop boxes would make it 
much harder for students to vote because, on election day, we have to be in school. I 
participate in sports and extracurricular activities and it is unlikely I’ll be able to find a time on 
election day to vote in person. Ballot boxes also allow people, like my parents, who have 
full-time jobs and a family to take care of to vote. Additionally, there is no evidence that ballot 
drop boxes have increased voter fraud or have security dangers associated with them. Early 
voting and absentee voting are valid and important ways to keep our democracy accurate and
serving everyone in our state. Without the voices of students and working-class citizens, our 
democracy wouldn’t be democratic at all. Voting is a right that everyone in this country has, 
and students and working-class citizens should not be discriminated against just because we 
can’t control the flexibility of our schedules. Maine has a long solid history of voting rights that 
make it easier for people to vote! Please continue this history and allow everyone, no matter 
their class or age, to vote by opposing LD 1055.
Thank you for your consideration,
Maya Faulstich
