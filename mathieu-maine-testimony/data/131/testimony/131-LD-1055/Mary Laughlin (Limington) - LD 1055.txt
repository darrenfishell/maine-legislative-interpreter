Re: Testimony against LD1055,  An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes
Good Morning,
I live in Limington, a town typical of many towns in Maine with a wide range of voters. Our 
young voters may work different shifts.  They may be very busy with young families.  Our 
older voters may be disabled and need assistance to get to the polls. 
Ballot drop boxes afford easier access for all of these voters to cast their ballots.
I see no good reason to prohibit the use of ballot drop boxes.   
The only reason to prohibit their use is to suppress voter participation.
I trust my municipal officials to manage and monitor the use of drop boxes according to the 
required Maine statutes so that no misuse occurs.  
I urge you to vote "ought not to pass" on LD 1055.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Mary Laughlin
