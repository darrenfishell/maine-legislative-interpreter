Good morning Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee. My name is Kate Kooperman. I am a resident of Portland and here to 
testify in opposition of LD 1055, ‘An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes‘. 
Offering multiple locations and methods to cast one’s ballot such as drop boxes is a reﬂection of 
how we sen/e our modern, diverse and dynamic state. Many citizens of Maine are working 
parents, teachers, nurses, sen/ice providers, people who are in motion, keeping our . 
communities flourishing. They are busy, often working hours that may not allow flexibility to 
leave during the day to vote. Many of our state's citizens have limited access to transportation or 
other reasons why using a ballot drop box is appropriate for them. It is crucial that we retain and 
strengthen all paths to voting for the people of Maine. 
I feel reassured knowing that ballot drop boxes are an option for me during our elections. The 
knowledge that they are available helps me to construct my plan to vote. 
The continued use of ballot drop boxes during elections is critical not only in Maine, but 
throughout our country. lt is the duty of our civil servants to ensure the stability of the structures 
that facilitate voting, not to dismantle them. I appreciate your consideration of this testimony and 
urge you to oppose LD 1055.
