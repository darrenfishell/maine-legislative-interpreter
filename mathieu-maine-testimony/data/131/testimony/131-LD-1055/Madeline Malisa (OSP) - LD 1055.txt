Chair Hickman, Chair Supica,  and honorable members of the committee, my name is 
Madeline Malisa, and I am a Visiting Fellow at the Opportunity Solutions Project. OSP is a 
non-partisan, non -profit organization. We work in more than 40 states across the country 
with one clear goal —to help more people achieve the American Dream. I appreciate the 
opportunity to submit written testimony  in support of LD 1055, which bans the use of 
ballot drop boxes.  
Security and oversight are crucial to successful election administration and voter 
confide nce in election results.  Banning drop boxes  will increase security  for the absentee 
voting process  in Maine . 
Drop  boxes were largely unused before the 2020 election, and lawmakers  across the 
country have recently enacted drop box reforms.  States like Misso uri and South Carolina 
have already passed legislation to ban  them .  
 
Maine  voters have many options to cast their ballots. They can vote in person on Election 
Day. They can vote in person during the early voting period. They can request an absentee 
ballot  and return it to their election office before or on Election Day.  They can return their 
absentee ballot by mail using  any postal box. They can also ask a family member, caregiver, 
or other trusted individual to hand deliver or mail their ballot.   
 
Maine  voters should have confidence that regardless of how they cast their ballots, their 
votes will count. For all these re asons, I urge you to support this legislation  and prohibit 
ballot drop boxes in Maine . Thank you for your time and I’m happy to provide additional 
information at the request of the committee .
