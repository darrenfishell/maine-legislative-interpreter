Testimony of Maine Conservation Voters
“An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes”
Before the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee
March 22, 2023
My name is Will Sedlack, Political Director at Maine Conservation Voters, writing in opposition
to LD 1055, “An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes” on behalf of more than 13,000
members and supporters of Maine Conservation Voters. Maine Conservation Voters works to
build an inclusive democracy and to make conservation and climate action a political priority .
We support measures that make voting more ef ficient, secure, and accessible for all eligible
Maine voters and oppose those that do not achieve that profoundly American goal.
This bill would
not
make voting more ef ficient, secure,
and accessible for all eligible Maine
voters and instead attempts to take away from eligible Maine voters an incredibly popular way to
conveniently and securely cast a ballot.
At Maine Conservation Voters we believe that the fundamental right to vote should
never
come
with barriers that make it more dif ficult, if not impossible, for some Mainers to make their voices
heard. Advocates working to curtail the rights and privileges of citizens should be held to a high
and rigorously enforced burden of proof to show why popular public benefits for citizens, once
granted, should be taken away . In our professional estimation and in the estimation of over 300
Mainers who signed a petition this week to oppose this piece of legislation, Senator Brakey has
not met this burden of proof. As a result, we believe that this is the wrong direction for Maine to
go in. Maine Conservation Voters ur ges you to vote “ought not to pass” on LD 1055.
Thank you.
William D. Sedlack, J.D.
Political Director
