In
opposition
to
the
LD1055:
An
Act
to
Prohibit
the
Use
of
Ballot
Drop
Boxes
Thank
you,
Senator
Hickman
and
Representative
Supica,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the 
Committee
on
V eterans
and
Legal
Af fairs
My
name
is
Angie
T ehuitzil,
I
live
in
Farmington,
Maine,
and
I
work
at
Maine
Y outh
Power
as
a 
legislative
fellow .
W e
are
a
youth-led
youth
movement
in
Maine
that
engages
youth
to
fight
for 
their
and
others'
future
and
bring
greater
success
in
Maine.
I
am
here
today
to
ask
that
you 
oppose
LD1055:
An
Act
to
Prohibit
the
Use
of
Ballot
Drop
Boxes.
I
am
an
active
political
student
at
the
University
of
Maine,
Farmington.
One
of
the
essential 
things
I
do
on
campus
is
to
inform
others
about
voting
and
why
it's
critical
for
youth
to
vote. 
Likewise,
on
campus,
other
students
and
I
hold
multiple
"walking
to
polls"
events
during 
elections
to
encourage
people
to
vote.
Many
college
students
appreciate
these
events
because 
they
can
go
with
a
group
or
friends
when
convenient
for
them,
rather
than
waiting
for
election 
day
to
go
and
vote.
I
have
also
worked
with
MYP
on
utilizing
relational
or ganizations
to 
encourage
youth
and
their
friends
to
vote
and
remind
them
of
the
dif ference
they
can
make.
Similarly ,
youth
vote
turnouts
are
rising
compared
to
the
last
midterms,
and
the
use
of
Ballot 
drop
boxes
doubled
the
percentage
of
youth
votes.
Not
only
was
45%
of
youth
using
ballot 
drop-of f
in
the
2020
election,
but
it
was
also
found
that
more
than
half
were
young
voters
of 
color
that
voted.
Thus,
compared
to
past
elections,
with
ballot
drop
boxes
there
has
been
an 
increase
in
youth
and
more
diverse
voters
such
as
black
people
and
people
of
color .
Likewise,
ballot
drop
boxes
are
an
alternative
option
that
is
highly
used
as
it
allows
people
to
get 
their
votes
collected,
whether
it's
because
they're
busy ,
the
line
waiting,
or
health
security
such
as 
the
measure
mainly
taken
during
the
pandemic.
Overall,
many
communities
appreciated
that
the 
voting
system
of fered
more
options
as
1
out
of
5
people
cast
ballots
by
drop
boxes,
and
in
Maine, 
requests
for
absentee
ballots
surpassed
those
voting
on
election
day .
Lastly ,
while
many
ar gue
that
drop-in
boxes
enhance
the
threat
of
fraud
and
worry
about
issues 
with
the
election
system,
there
was
no
evidence
of
fraudulent
behavior
in
the
2020
presidential 
election.
These
drop-of f
boxes
are
also
monitored
by
cameras,
made,
so
there
are
no
tamperings, 
secured
on
the
ground,
and
checked/emptied
by
clerks
multiple
times
daily .
No
one
that
is
eligible
to
vote
should
feel
that
there
are
barriers
that
are
not
making
it
impossible 
for
people
to
vote.
This
bill
is
making
it
challenging
for
all
to
vote
in
which
is
why
opposing
this 
bill
will
allow
for
voting
to
continue
being
accessible
and
for
people
to
feel
secure
about
their 
options
when
it
comes
to
voting.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
