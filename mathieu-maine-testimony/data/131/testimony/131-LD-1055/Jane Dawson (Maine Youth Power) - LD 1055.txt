Opposing  LD1055: An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop B oxes
Thank you, Senator Hickman and Representative Supica and honor able members of the jointstanding committee on Veterans and Legal Aﬀairs. My name is Jane Dawson, I grew up a nd stilllive in Pownal, Maine, and I am the Policy Director and a co-founde r of Maine Youth Power. Iam here today to ask that you oppose LD 1055:  An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop B oxes.
Over the past three years, much of my organizer work has centered around v oter turnout andengagement. From working at the polls to host ing pol itical forms to using relational organizingand phone banking tools to ensure that as many people in Maine as possible have the oppor tunityand ability to vote. This is a core value of not only the organization I co-founde d, M aine YouthPOwer, but a core value of Maine. Maine is a state that suppor ts all Mainers and ensures that weall can vote, regardless of it we can repeatably produc e phot o identiﬁcation.
Absentee ballot drop boxes have allowed young people l ike me to vote whenever they we re ableto. They ensure that working-class Mainers and M ainers that go to school have time to cast theirvote. Making voting easier for Mainers means that more people are able to vote. We more peoplevote we know that their region is better represented and therefore leads to more impactful policyand policymakers.
Absentee ballots encourage civic engagement in young people, oﬀering them  the rareopportunity to weigh in on political issues in Maine. Impeding young people’ s ability to voteleads to reduced interest in civic engagement and in the betterment of Maine as a state.
This bill, like the bill requiring photo IDs and ot hers, will only make it harder for people to voteand it will not make our elections any more secure.
If this bill will reduce voter turnout and will not make elections more secure there is no reason tovote ought to pass.
I encourage the committee to support
this bill.
