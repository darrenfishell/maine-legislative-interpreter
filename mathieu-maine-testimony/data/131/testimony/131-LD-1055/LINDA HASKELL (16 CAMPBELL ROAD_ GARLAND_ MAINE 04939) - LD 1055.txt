SP424   An Act to Prohibit the Use of  Ballot Drop Boxes 
The use of Drop Boxes is a cheaters program. We the people have and have had for 
numerous years the election sites/polls where we may vote with the privacy space 
needed. The unsatisfied loser of the election may run again the next time. I see that 
the Democrat party is trying to choke the honest legal residents, tax payer, hard 
working voters out of the final tally of the elections. Majority vote, one person, one 
vote, no fractional vote is the process that is legal and has been the process from the 
beginning of time, until the one world order has started to rear it ugly head. We the 
people do not want Ballot Drop Boxes on or at our elections!!!!!!!!!!!  LD1055 SP424
