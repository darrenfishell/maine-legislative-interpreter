Testimony Opposed to LD 1055 "An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes " 
 
Senator Hickman , Representative S upica,  and honorable members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee : 
 
AARP is the nationâ€™s largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering 
Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our more than 200,000 
members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony.  To day I am testify ing to 
express our opposition to LD 1055, a bill that bans absentee ballot drop boxes.  
 
LD 1055  could disenfranchise many older voters in the stat e, particularly voters with mobility 
issues, and those with disabilities by eliminating drop boxes, a popular way to return absentee 
ballots.  
 
Our members and o lder voters in general turn out overwhelmingly in every election. An AARP 
survey conducted shortly after the 2022 midterms showed that in 63 of the most competitive races 
for the U.S. House of Representatives, voters 50+ made up 61 percent of the ballots cast.1 Since the 
outbreak of the pandemic, Maine voters have increasingly voted b y absentee ballot , and many 
Mainers use drop boxes as a safe and convenient way to return their ballots.  
 
By banning drop boxes in the state, w e are concerned that LD 1055  will erect unnecessary barriers 
to voters  and eliminate  a popular option for returni ng an absentee ballot. A Pew Research survey 
from the 2020 election found that 41 percent of absentee voters used drop boxes to return their 
ballots  in that election .2 Banning drop boxes would also adversely affect voters with disabilities, 
who often require expansive options and accommodations to return their ballots. A 2022 survey 
conducted by Easterseals in conjunction with AARP found that 83 percent of voters with di sabilities 
support drop boxes.3 In addition to the barriers erected to voters, banning drop boxes would also 
not improve election security. A nationwide Associated Press survey of election officials found that 
there were no major issues with ballot drop b oxes in the 2020 election.4

AARP believes that the right to vote is a fundamental human right. Free and fair elections are 
essential to democracy and older voters are a key group that participates at high levels every 
election.  We hope you will take the  concerns of older voters to heart when deliberating on LD 
1055 .  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on this important bill . If you have question s for 
me, I can be reached at aanderson@aarp.org  or at 207 -330 -1147 .  
 
Sincerely,  
Alf Anderson
