RE:  LD 1055- An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes
My name is Pamela Vose.  I am a resident of Union.
I am testifying against LD 1055- An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes.
Ballot drop boxes are secure, convenient and necessary for those of us who are 
unable, for whatever reason, to visit our local polling place or other ballot return 
location accessible only during certain days and times.  Removing a no cost to the 
individual voter, proven safe and secure method of returning our ballots with no 
legitimate reason why can only be seen as a way to restrict voting for some people.  
The fact that "people" have "concerns" about the security of drop boxes is not a valid 
reason to remove them.   That "concern" can be resolved by simply telling people the 
truth about the security and safety of drop boxes and the absence of any meaningful 
fraud associated with their use.     
In this day and age we should be making voting more convenient and easier to do 
instead of making more irrelevant hoops for voters to jump through.    In fact in some 
areas we need more ballot drop boxes, not the removal of all of them.  
Thank you for the opportunity to share my strong opposition to this bill with you 
today.
