Good
morning
Senat or
Hickman,
Repr esentativ e
Supica,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
V eter ans
and
Legal
Affairs.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
writing
in
str ong
opposition
t o
LD
1055,
“ An
Act
t o
Pr ohibit
the
Use
of
Ballot
Dr op
Bo x es. ”
I
am
pr oud
t o
r epor t
that
her e
in
Lewist on
we
ha v e
many
diff er ent
wa ys
in
which
citiz ens
can
v ote.
W e
ha v e
four
Election
Da y
polling
places,
early
v oting
at
City
Hall,
absentee
balloting,
and
a
secur e
dr op
bo x
outside
City
Hall.
Along
with
v oting
early
and
mailing
in
absentee
ballots,
this
dr op
bo x
has
pr o v en
t o
be
a
popular
option,
especially
giv en
concerns
o v er
dela ys
in
deliv er y
via
the
postal
ser vice.
In
fact,
in
the
last
election,
nearly
42%
of
Lewist on
v oters
cast
their
ballots
in
a
manner
other
than
at
the
polls
on
Election
Da y .
What,
exactly ,
is
this
bill’ s
sponsor
tr ying
t o
accomplish
b y
taking
awa y
one
of
these
highly
popular
v oting
options?
In
an
er a
when
our
civic
institutions
and
democr atic
form
of
go v ernance
ar e
incr easingly
under
attack,
citiz ens
ought
t o
be
giv en
gr eater
oppor tunities
for
par ticipation,
not
f ewer .
The y
should
trust
that
the
go v ernment
v alues
citiz en
input
and
that
it
is
using
e v er y
a v ailable
means
t o
obtain
it,
r ather
than
limiting
the
people ’ s
ability
t o
