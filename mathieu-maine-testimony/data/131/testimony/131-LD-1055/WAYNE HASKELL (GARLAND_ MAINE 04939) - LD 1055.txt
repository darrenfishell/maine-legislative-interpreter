by Testimony from WAYNE D HASKELL  GARLAND, MAINE
I am against the use of ballot boxes off any kind in the Political Elections for this the 
United States and the State of Maine.We have voting area within each town, city or 
township. Why are the occupants of the elected offices at the State House, 
AUGUSTA, MAINE going to such lengths to change the laws, but for their agenda. I 
oppose these changes, testimony of WAYNE D HASKELL
