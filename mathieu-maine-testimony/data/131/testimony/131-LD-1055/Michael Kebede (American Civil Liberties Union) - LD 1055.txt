TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ. 
Ought Not to Pass — LD 1055 
An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes 
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
March 22, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Veterans and Legali Affairs, greetings. My name is Michael Kebede, and I am Policy Counsel 
for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide organization committed to 
advancing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. Constitutions. On 
behalf of our members, I urge you to oppose LD 1055 because it will make it harder for qualiﬁed 
voters to safely and efficiently cast their ballots. 
In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed “that voting is of the most fundamental 
signiﬁcance under our constitutional structure? “ In a democracy, the voters choose the 
government; the government does not get to choose the voters? Too often, however, proposals 
are put forth with no obvious rationale other than making it harder for certain groups of people—— 
people who have demanding jobs that keep them away from polling places during regular 
business hours; people with disabilities who have trouble voting on Election Day; people who 
are caregivers without a lot of ﬂexibility in their schedules; people without reliable postal 
service——to exercise their fundamental right to vote. The bill before you today is yet another in 
that class of proposals. We urge you to reject it.s

rights.”).

The right to vote is meaningless if people are not also ensured the opportunity to vote. 
“[T]he voter’s ability to actually cast a ballot” is thus a “fundamental right[]. ”3 Since 2020, 
thousands of people across Maine have exercised their right to vote by way of depositing their 
absentee ballots in secure drop boxes. These ballots are then subject to the same veriﬁcation and 
tabulation requirements that are applied when voters return their absentee through the postal 
service; the only important difference is that people are not required to rely on the postal service, 
which can take days or even Weeks to transport a letter across the state. 
“Voting is the beating heart of democracy. It is a fundamental political right, because [it 
is] preservative of all rights.”4 We urge you to preserve the right of Maine people to vote by 
voting ought not to pass.

their votes effectively ”).
