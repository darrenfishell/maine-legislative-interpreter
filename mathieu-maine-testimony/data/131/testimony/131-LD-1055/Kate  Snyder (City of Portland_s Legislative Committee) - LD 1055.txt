Testimony in opposition  of LD 1055  “An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes ” 
Senator Hickman , Representative Supica , and members of the Joint Standing Committee  on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs : 
I write to you  on behalf of the City of Portland’s Legislative/Nominating Committee in 
opposition of LD 1055 , An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes .  
Ballot drop boxes increase accessibility and convenience for vo ters. By providing a secure and 
easily accessible location for voters to drop off their ballots, it ensures that they can participate 
in the democratic process without having to worry about potential obstacles such as 
transportation or time constraints.  
 
Thank you for your consideration .
