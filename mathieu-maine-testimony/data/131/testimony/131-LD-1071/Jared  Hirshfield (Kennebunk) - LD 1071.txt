Neither
for
nor
Against
LD
1071 
"An
Act
to
Allow
Political
Candidates
to
Be
Nominated
by
Multiple
Parties
for
the
Same
Of fice"
Senator
Hickman,
Representative
Supica,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee 
on
State
and
Local
Government,
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
regarding
LD 
1071.
LD
1071
would
essentially
allow
a
version
of
what
is
called
electoral
fusion.
There
are 
two
versions
of
electoral
fusion
in
use
in
the
United
States.
The
Dual-labeling
version
which
is 
proposed
in
this
bill
and
full
electoral
fusion
as
is
used
in
Connecticut
and
New
Y ork.
The 
dif ference
between
these
two
types
of
electoral
fusion
lies
in
the
number
of
times
a
candidate's 
name
appears
on
the
ballot.
In
a
full
electoral
fusion
system
the
name
of
the
candidate
will 
appear
separately
for
each
party
they
are
nominated
by
and
their
total
votes
from
each
party
line 
tallied.
Under
this
dual-labeling
proposal,
the
candidates'
names
would
appear
only
once
with
the 
party
or
parties
who
are
nominating
them.
Prior
to
moving
to
Maine,
I
lived
and
worked
in
the
State
of
New
Y ork
which
used
a
full 
fusion
system.
Part
of
what
allowed
the
fusion
system
to
work
in
New
Y ork
was
the
fact
that 
voters
could
choose
which
party
they
were
voting
for
when
they
voted
for
an
individual 
candidate.
Under
this
proposal,
voters
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
this.
Rather ,
they
would
vote 
for
a
candidate
potentially
listed
under
multiple
parties.
Furthermore,
the
New
Y ork
full
electoral
fusion
system
allowed
for
a
tally
of
votes
by 
political
party ,
thus
allowing
data
to
be
kept
on
support
for
the
smaller
political
parties.
Under 
the
language
proposed
in
this
bill
that
data
would
be
unavailable.
In
the
two
states
that
use
full
electoral
fusion
systems
their
primaries
are
run
very 
dif ferently
from
Maineâ€™ s.
For
example,
New
Y ork
very
rarely
has
contested
primaries
for
local 
of fices.
Part
of
the
reason
electoral
fusion
works
in
New
Y ork
is
because
of
the
limited
number 
of
contested
primaries.
In
Maine
electoral
fusion
may
lead
to
candidates
attempting
to
enter 
primaries
of
a
rival
party
in
order
to
appear
as
the
only
candidate
on
the
ballot.
W ith
semi-open 
primaries
around
the
corner
in
Maine,
I
worry
about
candidates
attempting
to
take
advantage
of 
the
primaries
of
their
rival
political
party .
