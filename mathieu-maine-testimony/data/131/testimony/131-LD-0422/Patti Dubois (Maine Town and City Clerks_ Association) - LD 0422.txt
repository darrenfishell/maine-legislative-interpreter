Re: LD 422 — An Act to Eliminate the Requirement That Municipalities Provide Public 
Notice in Newspapers 
Position: Support 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is in strong support of LD 422 and we thank you 
for the opportunity to outline our points for your Committee. 
Municipal clerks support the option of meeting the public notice requirement by placing the 
notice on its municipal website. The fact that this is not a requirement but, rather, is 
optional was a selling point for our members since no size fits all in readership and 
availability of newspapers across the state. This bill would allow flexibility for municipalities 
to decide what method of notice is best for reaching its citizens. 
Clerks noted that cost savings could be realized by municipalities should this be passed. In 
addition, this could provide more consistency for citizens since newspapers that historically 
were daily newspapers are now opting to be printed for fewer days each week and have 
generally seen a shrinking audience with online news options being widely available. 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association appreciates the opportunity to share its 
testimony with the Committee. Should any questions arise, please feel free to contact me at 
207)680-4210 or by email: pdubois@waterville-me.gov .
