LD 422-  An Act to Eliminate the Requirement that Municipalities Provide Public Notice in 
Newspapers.  
 
Dear State and Local Government Committee:  
 I write on behalf of the Town of Thomaston in supporting LD 422. This proposed bill gives municipalit ies 
the option of advertising public notices in print newspapers , rather than  making it a requirement.  
 We are a small mid- coast town with a population of 2,800. We only have one local newspaper company 
in our area. If that one newspaper company were to ever  close, then the town would be required to 
advertise in larger newspaper firms like Bangor Daily News or Portland Press Herald at a much higher 
advertising rate.  This already is a cost burden for smaller municipalities that don â€™t have local newspaper s 
in their tow ns.  Even at a local level, newspaper advertising rates continue to increase each year. We 
paid $3,880 in fiscal year 2022 in advertising costs.  
 
Further, it is questionable how much readership the local newspaper g ets in print vs. online mediums. We 
do advert ise with our local newspapers on their on line service as well. Our small town has  been much 
more successful in sending out public notices on our website , newsletter, and Face Book page.  
 LD 422 will enable municipalities  to have the discretion whether to advertise in print or not.   
  
Thank you for your consideration in supporting LD 422  on the behalf of all qualifying municipalities.  
 
 
Best,  
 
 
Kara George  
Town Manager
