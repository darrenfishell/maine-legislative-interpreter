RE: LEGISLATIVE NOTICES ***#**(FAX: 297-15so)* 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: 
SEN. TIM NANGLE AND REP- HOLLY STOVER 
LD 422 2AN ACT TO ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT MUNICIPALITIES 
PROVIDE PUBLIC NOTICE IN NEWSPAPERS! 
COMMENTS: NO! NO! NO! NO! NOI- 
When I saw this notice in the MAINE SUNDAY TELEGRAM of 2-19-23, 
several relatively new terms came to miﬁa?'** 
AGEISM: DIVERSITY: INCLUSION: CENSORSHIPZ ISOLATION: CANCEL CULTURE: ETC. 
1 subscribe to the PRESS HERALD/SUNDAY TELEGRAM specifically 
for the LEGAL ADVERTISEMENTS. 
I can see an advertisement from Buxton, and right beside it 
there may be another ad from Sanford, Kennebunk, Cape Elizabeth, 
Portland, Brunswick, etc. dealing with the same issues. I can 
check their ordinances or proposals for comparison, such as how 
municipalities are dealing with the relatively new law concerning 
housing and local impacts. (I don,t use digital stuff, soI 
would be one of the isolated if this proposal were to pass). 
This proposal would EXCLUDE many in my AGE(ISM) group. 
The Municipalities already have the DIVERSITY to include this 
in their public access channels, but removing this from the 
LEGAL AD SECTION would have the effect of CENSORSHIP for us 
by restricting the flow of public information and moving it 
to just one source. 
You say, the municipalities could still advertise in the paper, 
but you know it will never happen. 
PLEASE; DO NOT LET THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE. 
SINCERELY, CE-III? ‘II-IZMAS, P. O. BOX H.1X‘IC1\1/ ME. 04093
