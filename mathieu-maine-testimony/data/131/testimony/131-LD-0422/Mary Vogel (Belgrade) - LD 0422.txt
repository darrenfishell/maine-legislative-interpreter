Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and 
Local Government, my name is Mary J. Vogel, and I am the Town Clerk for Belgrade.
I am submitting written testimony today to speak in support of LD 422, An Act to 
Eliminate the Requirement That Municipalities Provide Public Notice in Newspapers.
The requirement for municipalities to advertise in local newspapers is costly and 
burdensome to taxpayers.  Local newspapers cost for both block ads and for column 
ads have increased significantly over the past 10 years.  We are finding today that many 
people are using other sources of social media to get the information they need.
Local newspapers short shelf life considerably limits the town’s ability to reach its 
audience. Daily newspapers are especially affected, as readers may toss only a 
cursory glance at each day’s paper before running out the door to work. If the reader 
does not read the paper by the end of that day, ads that have been paid for will 
become obsolete, but other social media is available for a period.    Municipalities lack 
funds to advertise frequently, which makes it even less likely the business will reach 
its potential customers.
