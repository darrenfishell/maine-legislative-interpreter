I am writing today in support of LD1075, An Act to Promote Economic Growth 
Through Increased Film Incentives. Although I currently live in Massachusetts, I was 
raised in Maine; much of my family lives there. As such, I am aware of the economic 
realities of life in Maine. 
Movie and TV productions bring in a lot of out of state money and produce a lot of 
jobs. Whenever I am on set down here in MA, working as a background actor or 
"extra", I am struck by the number of people needed to make a movie. Those people 
need to be fed with locally purchased food, and provided with locally purchased fuel. 
The big names from away need to be housed, and have the budgets to rent nice places.
The productions I've been in have allowed me to start a new career and in time join 
SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union. Production companies are accustomed to working 
with union workers and paying good union wages. By giving production companies 
tax incentives to film in Maine, Maine people can get those good-paying gigs. The tax
incentives that Massachusetts grants have been a great success. I hope that the Maine 
legislature will enact their own incentives package.
Thank you for your attention.
