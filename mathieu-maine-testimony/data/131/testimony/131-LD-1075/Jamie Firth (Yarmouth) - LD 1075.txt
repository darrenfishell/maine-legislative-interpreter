LD 1075
Good Afternoon, Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation,
First of all, thank you for your public service - it is not easy or convenient to serve, I 
know.
I am writing to lend support on behalf of L.D. 1075, An Act to Promote Economic 
Growth Through Increased Film Incentives. I urge you to vote in favor of passage of 
this important bill.
Many other states have adopted aggressive incentives to encourage film making and 
have achieved significant economic benefits as a result. I hope Maine will seize this 
opportunity as well. More film making in Maine will bring more jobs for Mainers and
more revenues for Maine businesses. Film making requires carpenters, electricians, 
and other trades and workers; film crews need restaurants and hotels and motels for 
weeks, even months, at a time. Further, film making can happen in all regions of our 
state and it is a clean industry. 
Itâ€™s time for Maine to invest in a significant, aggressive way to better realize the huge 
economic potential of film making - through the incentives provided by LD 1075. 
Your vote in favor of L.D. 1075 will be a critical step in starting this process. Thank 
you for your consideration.
