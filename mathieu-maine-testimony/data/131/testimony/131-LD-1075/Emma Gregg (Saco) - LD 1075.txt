 Testimony in support of LD1075. My name is Emma Gregg, I am the director of production at p3 Maine, a production company based in Portland, ME. I am also the president of the Maine Film Association, a non-profit dedicated to advancing the art, craft and business of filmmaking in Maine.  I am writing to you today to share my support of increased tax incentives in Maine. I believe LD 1075 would be a great boon to our economy and would help provide more job opportunities for Mainers (especially recent graduates). I have witnessed these benefits first hand. Before working for p3, I was a freelance line producer for commercials and feature films. In this role I would help productions find local crew, actors, craftspeople, caterers, hotels, restaurants and so much more. A film production can act like a windfall for towns because of the opportunities they provide and the resources they require.  Let me give you an example. In the winter of 2018 I worked on a feature called Blow The Man Down that filmed in Harpswell. It is not an exaggeration to say our crew filled the vacant hotels and short-term apartments. We hired local townspeople to work on the movie, everyone from carpenters and caterers to teachers and business owners. We spent tens of thousands of dollars at local restaurants, bars and gas stations. By the time we wrapped everyone in the town knew the production and were glad to have the extra cash in the off-season. This is a model that can work in towns and cities across Maine. But the problem is when I talk to people interested in making a movie in Maine they often tell me that the current tax incentives make it “cost prohibitive.” But I can assure you the interest is there and the talent exists in Maine to support the work. Thank you in advance for supporting LD1075. Sincerely, Emma Gregg
