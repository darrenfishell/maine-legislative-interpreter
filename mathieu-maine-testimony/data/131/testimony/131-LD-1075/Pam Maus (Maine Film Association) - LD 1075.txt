To Taxation Committee Members, 
This letter is formally submitted as official testimony in relation to LD 1075 - An Act to Promote 
Economic Growth Through Increased Film incentives. 
As a full time Maine resident, I started making documentary films in 2012 during late career. 
Although Maine is filled with compelling stories, my craft is limited by the lack of support for 
filmmakers in Maine. It is easy to say, “This isn't Hollywood, why do we need to support people 
coming into our state to make films?” . However, as we all know, there is no more beautiful 
place to live and work.Why wouldn’t we want to show off our state and the many talented 
makers who want to live and work here. 
Currently l am the Communication and Administrative Coordinator for the Maine Film 
Association, and l feel fortunate to make some of my income related to the film industry. I am 
proud to be able to support the members of the MFA to help them leverage the opportunities 
they have in this state. They tend to be a younger population, who are ideally suited to the 
future of this state. 
l hope you will take into account how a clean industry such as filmmaking will bring much 
needed opportunities to not only keep people here, but to also attract them to Maine.
