Hello, my name is Joel Reidy and I live in Monmouth, Maine.   I’ve worked in the 
film industry since I graduated from the University of Maine at Orono in 1991.  Since 
that time guess how many days I’ve worked in Maine doing film work…… the 
answer is two. Two days of work in all that time.   I work primarily in Boston and 
commute or stay in Boston even though I live in Maine. A competitive tax incentive 
might help me work in the state I live in and love.  I look forward to the day when I 
can drive less than 3 hours to get home after work.  I appreciate the chance to be able 
to help bring my work home to Maine.  My name can be searched on IMDb.com.  
Except for two days on a commercial, none of that work was done in Maine.
