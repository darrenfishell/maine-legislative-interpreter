As a long time member of SAG-AFTRA it is a great disappointment that film 
production in Maine has been ignored by the Legislature.  Not only are you turning 
your nose up at an economic windfall (they spends LOTS of money when shooting 
and offer many jobs) but you are driving our young professionals in the industry 
away.  
Though my days as a performer are largely behind me (I am a 75 year old disabled 
Vet) I certainly would like to see the Legislature take off the blinders and get in the 
race.  Encourage Film Production in Maine!
