LD 1075
As a film and television producer I am testifying in support of LD 1075 -An Act to 
Promote Economic Growth Through Increased Film Incentives. As a resident of 
Maine, I had to leave the state to pursue my work. After 30 years I moved back to 
take care of my parents but my work was still mostly out of state. I have spent the last
15 plus years teaching workshops at Maine Media Workshops and promoting film 
and television work in Maine. Sadly, because there is not enough work here because 
of the lack of financial incentives, most of these young filmmakers from Maine, leave
the state, just as I did. If we want to keep young people investing in the future of 
Maine, we need to expand the job opportunities. Film and television has been a very 
successful business to keep people to stay and continue to invest in their state. Just 
look at Georgia and Massachusetts as two examples. Creating a film tax incentive 
creates local jobs and aligns perfectly with Governor Mills 10 year economic plan.
I look forward to the Maine State Legislature making the right decision for the future 
of Maine.
Thank you.
