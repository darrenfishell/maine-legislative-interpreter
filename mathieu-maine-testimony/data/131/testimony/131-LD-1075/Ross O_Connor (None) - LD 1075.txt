Subject: Support for LD 1705 
This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature. 
Dear Members of the Maine Legislature, 
I am writing to express my strong support for LD 1705, which aims to support and promote entrepreneurial independent 
producers in our state. As someone who is passionate about creating positive change in our community, I believe that 
this bill has the potential to make a significant impact on our local economy and our cultural landscape. 
As an independent producer myself, I know firsthand the challenges that come with trying to start and grow a business 
in today's world. The cost of production equipment and studio space alone can be prohibitively expensive, and it can be 
difficult to find the resources and support needed to bring our creative visions to life. Without a film tax incentive 
competitive with other states, it becomes fiscally irresponsible for productions to film here, at the expense of our state's 
economy. 
That's why I believe that LD 1705 is so important. By providing funding and resources to support independent producers, 
we can help to unlock the tremendous potential of our creative community. This bill will not only provide critical support 
to small businesses and entrepreneurs, but it will also help to promote Maine's unique cultural identity and artistic 
heritage. 
I have seen firsthand the transformative power of independent media and art, and I believe that we need to do 
everything we can to support those who are working to make a difference in our community. By passing LD 1705, we 
can help to create a more vibrant and thriving artistic community in Maine, and I urge you to support this important bill. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Ross O'Connor
