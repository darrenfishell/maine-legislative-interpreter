Hello,
My name is Dirt Haehnel. I am a member of IATSE Local 481 with 10+ years of 
experience in the film industry as a lighting technician and grip. I am based in Saco, 
Maine and relocated here from New York in 2020. I have seen first hand the positive 
effects a bill of this sort can have on a community. When significant tax breaks 
became available in Upstate New York to large scale narrative and commercial 
productions, the influx of projects into the area was substantial and immediate. I, 
along with the vast majority of my crew and others were able to permanently relocate 
from New York City to upstate towns along the Hudson river. This move resulted in 
huge improvements to our collective quality of life as well as a massive boon to the 
economies of these small towns. The state of Maine, not only the city of Portland, has 
an opportunity with the passing of this bill to gain the same profits and economic 
rewards I saw in New York towns like Kingston, Newburgh, Hudson, Buffalo and 
many more. These same towns are still benefiting from a consistent flow of 
production work 5+ years later. The average feature length film from large production
houses like Netflix or HBO shoots for 1-3 months with a crew of 50 - 150. Revenue 
from these production, cast and crew members go directly into local businesses in the 
food, hospitality and entertainment industries. I have personally worked on over 30 
projects like this and have seen the positive effects of a production's presence on the 
local economy first hand. Maine relies heavily on tourism already as a destination 
state. The passing of this bill will put us on the map as a film production destination 
and result in exponential growth to our local economy. We simply cannot afford to 
not pay attention to this opportunity. Thank you for your consideration and this 
opportunity to bare my testimony.
Sincerely, 
Dirt Haehnel
