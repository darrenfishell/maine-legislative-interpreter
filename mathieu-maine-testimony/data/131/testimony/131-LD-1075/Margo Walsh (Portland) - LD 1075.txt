LD 1075
To the Maine Legislature,
 
I am writing in support of LD1075 presented by Senators Mattie Daughtry and Henry 
Ingwersen and Representatives Gere and Roeder.
 
It has been an honor that MaineWorks was the subject of two movies produced and 
directed in Portland by the VIA Agency and Sternman Productions.  The first was 
‘Now What’, the second was ‘Hopeful: The Story  of MaineWorks’ which had it’s 
world premiere at the Maine International Film Festival last year.  There was a lot of 
discussion about movie making in Maine.  Being part of these productions was 
uplifting and exciting for our employees.  It was such a thrill to see their stories come 
to life in artistic and thoughtful ways.
 
From a workforce standpoint, MaineWorks would be honored to offer apprenticeships
or entry level careers in the myriad trades that support the film industry.  The 
proposed legislation, which would provide tax credits and other benefits to movie 
makers to come to Maine, would invigorate an important part of our economy.
 
There are too many movies that are about Maine and filmed in other locations. 
 
I would expect this legislation to pass in order to promote the rugged lifestyle, scenic 
beauty and natural resources which define Maine.  Filmmaking brings a community 
of people together from disparate backgrounds and skill sets to work communally on 
each film.  This opportunity to work as part of a creative team with public facing 
outcomes would be an outstanding career for young Mainers interested in the arts.
 
Passing this legislation would provide employment, direct impact for local hotels, 
shops and residents, provide incredible learning opportunities and facilitate 
community engagement.
I support LD1075.
 
All the best,
Margo Walsh
