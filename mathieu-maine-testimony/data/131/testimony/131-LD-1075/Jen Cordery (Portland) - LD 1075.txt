Maine State House ATTN: Committee on Taxation  c/o Legislative Information Oﬃce
Clerk, Benjamin Berry
Dear Taxation Committee Members,
My husband, Matt Cascella, and I moved to Maine in September 2020, after 16 years working in documentary, TV, and ﬁlm in New York. We were so inspired by the city of Portland and our new home state that we immediately started working on a feature-length movie script set here. 
Our script and the setting of Maine attracted talented actors – Desmin Borges (FX’s You’re the Worst, HBO’s Time Traveler’s Wife); Kelly O’Sullivan (Saint Frances); Barbara Rosenblat (Orange is the New Black); Catherine Curtin (Stranger Things); Steve Coulter (SheHulk, Yellowstone); and Maine’s own Matthew Delamater (The Tender Bar). We supplemented with local talent and extras, hired as many local crew as we could ﬁnd (14 out of 23 total), and got to work nailing down locations with the help of the Maine Film Oﬃce.  
We entered into production on Hangdog in early 2022 and ﬁlmed for 18 days over the course of April. Our ﬁlm had a budget of $400,000, half of which was pumped directly into the Portland economy through labor, hotels, car rentals, Airbnbs, catering, restaurants, the Casco Bay ferry, parking, gas stations, shops, and other expenses. 
We decided to set our ﬁlm here, knowing that the tax incentives weren’t ideal, because the city of Portland was essentially a central character in our ﬁlm and nowhere else would suﬃce. Had our budget been in the millions, as most ﬁlm productions are, we likely would have had to rewrite the script for an alternate location (Nova Scotia seems to be a frequent stand-in). 
It takes a village to make a feature, and we embraced – and were embraced by – our local community of entrepreneurs, makers, artists, and ﬁlmmakers. We aimed to feature multiple local businesses on camera and worked with several local artists for all of our art needs. We found the process of ﬁlming in Portland to be one of generosity, community, and creativity, and received nothing but support from every single person and business we encountered. We hope to have another opportunity to ﬁlm here. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. Please see the following page for a list of locations we showcased and businesses we supported. 
Sincerely,
Jen Cordery & Matt Cascella
