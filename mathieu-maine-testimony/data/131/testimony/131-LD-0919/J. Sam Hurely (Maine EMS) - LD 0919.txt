Testimony of J. Sam Hurley, MPH, EMPS, NRP  
Director , Maine Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (Maine EMS)  
Department of Public Safety  
In Support of  LD 919 
“An Act to Facilitate Employment in the Field of Emergency Medical Services ” 
Presented by Senator  Nicole Grohoski of Hancock County 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC 
SAFETY  
Public Hearing: Tuesday, May 9, 2023 
 
Senator Be ebe Center , Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety:  
 
My name is Sam Hurley , and I am the Directo r of Maine Emergency Medical Services, Maine 
EMS, within the Department of Public Safety. I am testifying  on behalf of Maine Department of 
Public Safety and Maine EMS  in support of LD 919, “ An Act to Facilitate Employment in the 
Field of Emergency Medical Services .” 
 
Maine EMS appreciates the Senator ’s amendment  and the i ntroduc tion of  this legislation to 
support the Maine EMS Board. Maine EMS currently recognizes multiple levels of licensure for 
all the entities that we license, EMS clinicians and services throu ghout the state. However, we 
were recently made aware that we may need to clarify the statutes related to EMS licensing that 
give the Board the authority to set specific levels of licensure for all  its regulated entities. This 
isn't necessarily adding n ew authority; instead, is clarifying the Board's authority to issue various 
EMS licenses for persons responsible for providing out -of-hospital emergency services. For 
instance, the Board already issues licenses for Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) and 
Page 2 of 2  
 Emergency Medical Technician; however, the statutory language doesn't specifically authorize 
multiple levels of licensure for basic emergency medical services persons.  
 
This is a clean up bill to align the current practices  and authorization of the Board of Emergency  
Medical Services across chapter.  
 
I am more than happy to answer any questions that you may have , but please feel free to reach 
out to me  anytime if there is any additional information that  we can offer you and/or the 
Committee . Thank you.
