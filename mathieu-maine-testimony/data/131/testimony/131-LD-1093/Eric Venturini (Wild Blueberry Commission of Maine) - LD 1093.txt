Testifying in Opposition  
LD 1093 , An Act to Create a Seasonal Gas Tax Exemption and Rate  
Senator Chipman , Representative  Williams , and esteemed members of the Committee on  
Transportation , my name is Eric Venturini and I am the Executive Director of the Wild Blueberry 
Commission of Maine .  
The Wild Blueberry Commission works on behalf of Maine’s 4851 wild blueberry farmers and businesses  
who grow our iconic wild blueberries on approximately 4 2,0002 acres across the state  and on 
Pass amaquoddy tribal land. In 2022, Maine produced 76 million pounds of wild blueberries representing 
nearly 100% of all wild  blueberries  and 9.6% of all blueberries  grown in the US. Our industry contributes 
an estimated 250 million dollars to the state’s  economy each year and t hat contribution brings vital  
economic activity to Maine’s most impoverished count y, Washingto n County.3 
In reading this bill , it appears the intent is to generate tax income from the 20 million  plus tourists who  
flock to Vacation Land each year by increasing the excise tax  on gasoline  by 10 cents per gallon.  
The bill , however,  will also disproporti onally hit the agricultur al sector . Farming  in Maine  is seasonal, 
with most activities occurring between May 1 and Thanksgiving Day. During this time , producers move 
farm machinery from field to field, transport crews of workers in and out of Maine and bet ween fields 
for harvest, truck berries from the field to the processors and from the processors to the freezers and 
buyers. My point is, that a n increase in the  fuel tax during this time of year will be paid not only b y 
tourists with enough surplus income to go on vacation, but also by Maine’s hard working family farms. 
Many of those farmers  struggle to stay in  business.  
The Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine , as representative of this critical  Maine industry, has identified 
as a Barrier to Prosperity , the:  
Lack of profitability discourage[ing]  the next generation from growing wild blueberries and

Additionally, in  2022, the Commission conducted a series of Grower Listening Sessions across the State. 
Our farmers voiced  concerns about labor, climate change, and many other topics  – but what tied all 
these concerns together was the challenge of  economic viability .  
As a representative of this industry and of these farmers, we oppose anything that will make i t even 
more challenging for Maine’s wild blueberry producers to earn a living . This bill would  impose a tax  
increase  unfairly on Maine farmers , and we urge you to vote, Ought Not To Pass.   
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions t hat you may have.
