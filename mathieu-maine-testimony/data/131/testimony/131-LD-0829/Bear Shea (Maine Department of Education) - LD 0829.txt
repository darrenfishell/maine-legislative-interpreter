The proposed amendment to LD 829, An Act to Improve Behavioral Health Support for Students 
in Public Schools , proposes  three m ajor elements : changing the term “school social worker” t o 
“clinical mental health provider;”  that the University of Southern Maine engage in a pilot 
training program  with 15 -20 educators; and that the student -to-staff ratios for  school 
psychologists  be set at 5 00:1 for the purpose of EPS .  
In addition to the concerns below, this bill has the potential to impact the Maine D epartment of 
Education  (DOE) proposed Chapter 117 rule which may  require additional revisions  before it has 
even been adopted.  Since Chapter 117  is currently awaiting a legislative hearing , this would 
delay much needed clarifications to the field in areas that have already been addressed by statute. 
Many of the provisions of LD 829 are more appropriately explained in Department -level 
guidance docum ents that are distributed to the field.   The Department has concerns about 
replacing the term “school social worker” with “clinical mental health provider.” Because the 
term “school social worker” covers a wide range of roles within a school, eliminating t he term 
altogether is problematic.  We suggest adding the term “clinical mental health provider” to the 
definition  of “guidance counselor” in MRSA 20A §15672 §11.  This will ensure that all 
members of the school mental health community are included and considered.   
Finally, the last element of LD 829 proposes a set ratio for both school psychologists  and 
“clinical mental health provider .” Currently, the Essential Programs and Services formula  does 
not differentiate the different types of school mental health workers. The current  student to 
guidance  ratio for Non -Special Education services is 350:1 for elementary schools and 250:1 for 
secondary schools. Ch anges to the ratio will have impacts on EPS formula calculations.  
Addressing access to best -practice resources to support student  behavioral  and mental  health has 
been a priority for the DOE that has been ref lected in the Department's  internal reorganization 
and creation of the Office of School and Student Supports and the addition of the first mental 
health specialist position over three years ago. Through the pandemic , the Department has 
focused  resources specifically supporting stud ent mental and behavioral health by increasing 
access to best -practice prevention programming  as well as broadening resources to systemic

support system s such as Multi -Tiered  Systems of Support and Positive Behavior Intervention and 
Supports. Additionally, DOE staff provid ed over 20,000 contact hours of free , mental health 
related  professional development and technical support directly to school staff.  
Educating and supporting students to have positive behavioral response s is a multidimensional  
process and , taking into account research that shows the  negative impact  of the  pandemic  on 
mental health factors , the need for a whole student approach is appar ent. While the DOE 
recognizes the significant , continued need for mental and behavioral health supports in schools,  
and looks to increase access to mental health professionals and resources,  we encourage the 
Committee to deliberate on the Chapter 117 and Chapter 33 rules before considering LD 829  and 
the implications for the fi eld.  We also understand, based on discussions with the sponsor of the 
bill, that there are further potential changes to LD 829.  The Department is happy to discuss these 
changes with the Committee  and the sponsor .    
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 829 and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
