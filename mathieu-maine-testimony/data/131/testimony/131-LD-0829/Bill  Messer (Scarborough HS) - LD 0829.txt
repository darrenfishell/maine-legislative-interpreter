God afternoon,
Over the last 30 plus years, I have worked and/or have been involved with mental 
health, Day Treatment education and public school education. During this time, I've 
had the fortune opportunity to see how mental health and education interweave with 
each system(s) given the current infrastructure at a local and state level. There has 
been a significant spike since COVID (even prior to COVID) with students 
possessing moderate to severe mental health concerns (Depression, Anxiety, suicide 
ideations or attempts, family conflicts, substance use and abuse) which  has 
dramatically interfered with students to be fully available to learn and be present in 
their classrooms. Often times, families aren't aware of community based resources 
that they could use to help best support students mental health needs or in many cases 
resources are limited to families due to long wait lists or no openings. Resources 
could include but not limited to; case management, outpatient therapy, support groups
or medication management. 
Given the limitations of community based resources and the spike of mental health 
and substance abuse within our local and state wide schools, teachers, social workers 
are at the forefront in best supporting and managing students behaviors and treatment 
needs, which can often involve parents. To help reduce the frequency and duration(s) 
of students emotional difficulties/behaviors at schools and or need to bridge 
community base services with students, school districts state wide need to make 
working with and treating (at times) a priority. Schools need to hire social workers 
who have experience in the field and that can also train educators ion how best to 
work with students who have these concerns at school. Students will never be able to 
be fully "available" to learn and grow socially if mental health issues are current in a 
child's life.
