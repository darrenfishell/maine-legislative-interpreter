Support of LD 8,291 An Act to Improve Behavioral Health Support for Students in Public Schools 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Gay Anne McDonald and I am the Executive Director for 
the Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities (MADSEC). 
On behalf of MADSEC, I am providing testimony in support of LD 829! An Act to Improve Behavioral 
Health Support for Students in Public Schools. MADSEC acknowledges and appreciates the recognition 
by Representative Crafts and the co—sponsors of this bill to address the behavioral health needs in Maine 
schools and supports LD 829 as amended. 
Speciﬁcally, MADSEC supports the amendment to include both direct and indirect services to students, 
which aligns with Title 20—A MRSA§4008 —A, sub~§2 and proposed Chapter 117 rules, and for striking the 
requirement for SAUs to employ an educator at each school who has completed a national 
board-certi ﬁed assistant behavior analyst training. 
MADSEC supports the establishment of a pilot program to further support educators in responding to 
behavioral health needs of students, however, current language in the bill is unclear as to who this 
collaboration would be with.' 
In closing, MADSEC would like the Committee to be mindful that a change in student—to-staff ratios may 
result in a reduction in state funding to school districts. 
Thank you for your time, consideration, and service to our state.
