No changes need to be made to current law.  
Each school district should be able to make a determination as to how much, if any, 
Behavioral Health Support it needs.  Additional resource determination certainly does
not need to be made at the state level.  Any additional school resources should be 
concentrated on learning â€“ reading, writing, math.  Additionally, we have shortages in
home and community based services - let's not exacerbate the problem by pulling 
resources from our communities into the schools.
OUGHT NOT TO PASS
