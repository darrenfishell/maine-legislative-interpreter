Re: Neither For Nor Against LD 829: An Act to Improve Behavioral Health Support for Students 
in Public Schools 
Date: March 28, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished member s of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, greetings. My name is Ruth Crowell, I ama 
certiﬁed school psychologist-specialist with 40 years of experiences providing school 
psychological services in the state of Maine and am the past-president of the Maine Association 
of School Psychologists. I am speaking neither for nor against LD 829, An Act to Improve 
Behavioral Health Support for Students in Public Schools. 
MASP supports the goal of improving behavioral health support in Maine’s schools. Children 
and adolescents are currently facing a mental health crisis. According to the National Association 
of School Psychologists, one in ﬁve students are suffering from a mental health disorder and 
roughly 80% of children and youth who are in need of mental health services do not receive 
them. Furthermore, the majority of students who do receive mental health services will receive 
them within the school setting. Data indicates that when student’s mental health needs are met, 
this leads to an improved ability to learn as well as ongoing safety and crisis prevention. This 
information clearly identiﬁes the strong need for increasing student access to school based 
behavioral and mental health services. (http§,,,;,{[gs5.§gx§_;nasp5g~ilwii1e.cln*g/Qf1§i}g)_gg;-g>l~ .

MASP supports increasing the ratio of school based mental health providers as a means of 
increasing student access to mental health services. LD 829 addresses improving ratios for 
Guidance Counselors and school-based Social Workers as well as increasing the number of 
school-based Board Certiﬁed Behavioral Analysts. However, LD 829 does not address the ratio 
of students to school psychologists, even though Maine’s ratio of approximately 1,500 - l is well 
above the recommended ratio of 500 - l and also well above the standards proposed for other 
school-based mental health service providers in LD 829. . 
School psychologists ’ unique training in the fields of psychology and education speciﬁcally 
prepare us to effectively provide a broad range oi’ mental and behavioral health services in public 
schools. These services include identifying students with mental health needs and providing 
services for these students on multiple levels within the school setting. School Psychologists ’

training includes direct services such as individual and group therapy as in developing effective 
behavioral interventions for students. School Psychologists also have expertise in leading schools 
to develop l\/iulti~Tiered Systems ofSupport (MTSS) speciﬁcally focused on improving students ‘ 
Social Emotional Learning (SEL). The breadth and depth of School Psychologist ’s training in 
providing a broad range ofschool-based behavioral and mental health supports and interventions 
makes them valuable members of a school’s behavioral and mental health team. 
Given the important role school psychologists play in identifying and addressing student 
behavioral and mental health needs, l\/IASP believes that it is critical to include a goal for 
decreasing the ratio of students to school psychologists within Maine schools as part of LD 829. 
We believe omitting school psychologists from this bill represents a grave oversight.
