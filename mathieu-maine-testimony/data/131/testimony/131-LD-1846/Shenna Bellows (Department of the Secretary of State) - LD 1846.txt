Testimony of Shenna Bellows, Secretary of State 
Department of the Secretary of State 
May 10, 2023 
Testifying Neither for Nor Against 
L.D. 1846, “Amend a Circulator's Oath for Petitions and Nomination Papers by Including the Number 
of Signatures Collected" 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans 
and Legal Affairs, my name is Shenna Bellows, and I am the Secretary of State and the chief elections 
officer. I am speaking today neither for nor against L.D. 1846 to provide the committee with 
information to consider in your decision-making. 
This bill, as written, would require the Elections Division to amend the form of the petition to include 
text and space for the circulator to fill it in with the number of signatures before signing the oath. The 
problem is what to do if the circulator does not indicate the number of signatures. This is not 
something required by the Constitution to either certify a petition or not, so we do not think we could 
reject the petition if that part of the oath is not completed. 
Additionally, requiring a circulator to determine the number of signatures would not necessarily make 
it easier for the municipal clerks/registrars or the Elections Division when they go through the 
certification process since both the municipalities and the state conduct independent verifications of 
each petition. 
For all these reasons, I testify neither for nor against this bill. This concludes my testimony. Thank you 
and I would be happy to answer any questions that the committee may have.
