Hello,
Thank you for allowing this testimony. 
I am writing this because I think this bill is simple and smart and is a great way to 
break away from the inspection laws on vehicles that in many cases, do not and 
should not require a state inspection. 
It is only for class C vehicles, which makes sense since most of these new vehicles 
have dealer and manufacturers warranties to cover most, if not all of the specified 
time. 
I would have to say that making the inspection due on the month of purchase after the 
3 year duration is a way to allot for time the inspection would be due. 
A 2023 vehicle bought this month,April, would be due for the required first state 
vehicle inspection in April of 2026. 
Any owner would still have the right to state inspect the vehicle every year if they 
choose to but is not required until 3 years from the model year. 
I like this bill. I think it is a great test to Mainers to show that not all vehicles should 
require a state inspection due to other market coverages and is quite honestly, just a 
boon for the garages and plays no significant role in safety on the roads. 
I do hope you will truly consider this testimony and I do hope and am looking 
forward to this bill passing into law. 
Thank you so much for your time.
