Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1587:
“An
Act
to
Amend
the
Motor
Vehicle
Inspection
Law
to
Exempt
Certain
Motor
Vehicles
Less
than
3
Years
Old”
Senator
Chipman,
Representative
Williams,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Transportation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1587.
This
question
has
been
endlessly
studied,
even
by
the
federal
government.
Inspection
programs
are
not
correlated
with
greater
roadway
safety
in
states
which
have
them
versus
states
which
do
not.
A
2015
report
from
the
federal
Government
Accountability
Office
(GAO)
that
reviewed
six
rigorous
studies
examining
vehicle
safety
inspection
programs
found
no
statistically
significant
difference
in
crash
rates,
fatalities,
or
injuries
between
states
with
and
without
inspection
programs.
1
Maine
drivers
spend
an
estimated
$16
million
in
stickers
and
vehicle
maintenance—and
countless
hours—getting
their
vehicles
inspected
each
year,
despite
the
absence
of
evidence
that
mandated
inspections
increase
safety
or
reduce
the
number
of
accidents
and
injuries
on
our
roads
and
highways.
Because
of
this,
state
vehicle
inspection
mandates
should
simply
not
exist
for
non-commercial
vehicles.
2
But,
if
inspections
are
to
remain
in
law,
the
program
should
be
administered
with
common
sense.
This
includes
exempting
young
vehicles
from
the
mandate,
whether
they
be
three,
five,
or
ten
years
old.
Any
measure
to
this
effect
would
be
prudent
for
this
Legislature.
To
date,
a
majority
of
states
do
not
require
vehicle
inspections
for
safety.
Only
20
states
still
have
these
laws
on
the
books
and
five
of
them,
including
California,
Colorado
and
Rhode
Island,
require
them
only
every
two
years.
3
Opponents
will
say
that
any
change
to
the
inspections
program
would
lead
to
people
driving
cars
which
are
falling
apart,
an
absurd
hyperbole
which,
of
course,
they
contend
means
roads
are
less
safe.
Their
claim
demands
real
scrutiny.

Vehicular
mechanical
failures
are
such
a
minor
factor
in
collisions
that
the
Maine
Department
of
Transportation
just
started
including
them
in
their
crash
statistics
report
in
the
last
decade.
Of
course,
there
is
potential
for
a
crash
to
be
caused
by
more
than
one
factor,
but
the
report
shows
little
more
than
3%
of
the
accidents
from
2015
to
2019
involved
a
vehicular
issue.
Those
involving
tire,
wheel,
steering,
suspension,
transmission,
or
brake
issues
made
up
only
1.75%
of
the
five-year
total
published
in
the
most
recent
report.
4
Additionally,
state
law
provides
a
mechanism
to
keep
roads
safe
from
dangerous
vehicles.
Title
29-A,
section
1768,
subsection
5
designates
the
authority
of
the
State
Police
to
determine
if
a
driver
is
operating
a
“defective
vehicle,”
including
paragraph
B
which
states,
“A
person
who
violates
this
subsection
commits
a
Class
E
crime
if
the
vehicle
is
unsafe
for
operation
because
it
poses
an
immediate
hazard
to
an
occupant
of
the
vehicle
or
the
general
public.”
5
Simply
put,
Maine
State
Police
do
not
need
a
vehicle
inspection
requirement
to
maintain
safety
on
the
roads.
Please
deem
LD
1587
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
begin
to
remove
the
multitude
of
ineffective
ways
Mainers
are
nickel-and-dimed
by
their
government
in
the
name
of
“safety.”.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
