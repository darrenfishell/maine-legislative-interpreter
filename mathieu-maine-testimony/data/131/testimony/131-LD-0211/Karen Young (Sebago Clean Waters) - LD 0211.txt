TESTIMONY OF Sebago Clean Waters IN SUPPORT OF
LD 211 – AN ACT TO AMEND THE LAWS GOVERNING WATER SUPPLY PROTECTION 
FUNDS
 
 
Chair Senator Lawrence, Co-Chair Representative Ziegler and Members of the Committee on
Energy, Utilities and Technology. I am Karen Young, Partnership Director for the Sebago 
Clean Waters coalition and am providing this testimony in support of LD 211.
Sebago Clean Waters is a coalition of nine conservation organizations and the 
Portland Water District working collaboratively to protect water quality, community 
well-being, a vibrant economy and fish and wildlife habitat in the Sebago region 
through voluntary forestland conservation and stewardship. Our coalition came 
together in 2017 around a shared goal of conserving 25% of the Sebago watershed 
forests that naturally purify the water in Sebago Lake, the drinking water supply for 
greater Portland and 219,000 people. These forests also provide many other benefits 
including healthy fisheries and wildlife habitat; opportunities for outdoor recreation; 
support for our local economy, mitigation of storms, cleaner air and more
SCW member organizations are collaborating to increase the pace of forest conservation for 
this and future generations. Our land trust partners have been working closely with the 
Portland Water District for over two decades and, through collaboration, have been able to do
much more conservation than any one entity would alone.  Working as a coalition advances 
our shared goal and provides so many benefits to Maine.
 
On behalf of our coalition members, I am encouraging you to support this bill because it will 
help increase the pace of forestland conservation that is key to protecting greater Portland’s 
water supply.  The ability for Portland Water District to provide direct financial support to the 
land trusts for this work will help us to bring more projects to closing more quickly and will 
increase the many benefits conserved forests provide to our communities.
