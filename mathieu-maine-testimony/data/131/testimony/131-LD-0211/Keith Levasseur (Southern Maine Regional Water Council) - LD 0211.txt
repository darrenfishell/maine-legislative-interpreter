RE: Testimony in Support of LD 211, An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Water Supply Protection Funds 
Dear Senator Lawrence and Representative Zeigler and Members of the Committee on Energy, Utilities and 
Technology: 
The Southern Maine Regional Water Council (SM RWC) urges the committee to support LD 211 An Act to 
Amend the Laws Governing Water Supply Protection Funds. SM RWC was formed by an act of the Maine 
Legislature in 2005. It consists of 7 water utilities in York and Cumberland County serving a total of 
approximately 300,000 people in 23 communities, or 25% of the population of the State of Maine. Our 
members are Kittery Water District, York Water District, Kennebunk Kennebunkport Wells Water District, 
South Berwick Water District, Sanford Water District, Maine Water Company — Biddeford/Saco, and Portland 
Water District. 
One of the more serious and imminent threats to public water supplies in Southern Maine is development in 
our watersheds. We are very lucky to live in a state with near pristine resources from which to draw our 
drinking water. This legislation would better facilitate the preservation of land in watersheds, thus allowing 
public water supplies to continue to provide abundant, clean, and affordable water to the citizens of our State 
for generations to come. Preservation of land in watersheds is often accomplished through partnerships 
involving water utilities, conservation groups, land owners, and various state agencies. The proposed changes 
to 35-A M.R.S.A §6113 clarify that a water utility could purchase a conservation easement, and would allowa 
water utility to work with a land trust or other non-profit entity that would be holding land in conservation by 
allowing the utility to give money from its water supply protection fund to the non-profit to go toward the 
conservation interest acquisition by the non-profit entity. 
Sincerely, 
President
