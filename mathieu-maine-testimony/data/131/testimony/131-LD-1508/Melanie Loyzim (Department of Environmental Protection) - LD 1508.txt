Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, l am 
Melanie Loyzim, Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, 
speaking in opposition to each of mining bills being heard today, with the exception of 
L.D. 1363. 
The Department recommends that only careful and narrow changes should be made to 
Maine’s Metallic Mineral Mining Act, to support environmentally responsible extraction 
of minerals needed for modern technology. Maine’s current law is vely restrictive, and 
the Department expects that any mining activity licensed and conducted under the law 
will not contaminate ground or surface waters, will not unreasonably impact protected 
natural resources, and will not adversely affect public health. Neither a moratorium as 
proposed in L.D. 1508 nor a Commission as proposed in L.D. 1495 are necessary. 
Additionally, the Department has adequate authority to regulate exploration activities, 
and requiring a full mining permit as proposed in L.D. 1564 would unnecessarily impede 
characterization of mineral deposits. L.D. 1471 would add a variety of new restrictions 
and review criteria to the law. The Department does not have adequate information 
about the projected environmental benefit of these requirements to assess them. 
The Department also recommends against the categorical exemptions for specific 
minerals proposed in L.D. 1433 and 1476. Deposits in different areas of the state will 
pose different environmental risks, and processing metallic minerals poses different 
risks than extraction. Exempting a particular type of rock from the Mining Act exempts 
all activities with that rock, from manual removal in a quarry to operation of a processing 
facility that produces wet tailings. Narrower, specific exemptions for lower risk activities 
are more appropriate, such as the exemption proposed in L.D. 1363 for manufacturing 
cement with limestone. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. l am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
