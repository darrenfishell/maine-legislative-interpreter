My

on
behalf
of
Maine
Y outh
Action,
a

youth
advocacy

that
represents
hundreds
of
young
Mainers
from
varying

and

and

Maine
Y outh
Action
and
our
members
understand
the
need
to
address
climate
change.
As
we
have
said
in
this
committee
before,
it
is
the
youth
of
our
state
that
will
be
impacted
the
most
by
the
climate
crisis
and
the
decisions
we
make
today .
W e
also
understand,
and
advocate
for ,
the
state
to
contribute
its
part
to
reversing
the
ef fects
of
climate
change,
especially
by
committing
to
the
Maine
W on’ t
W ait
climate
action
strategy .
However ,
despite
the
ur gency
to
act
swiftly
in
order
to
achieve
our
goals,
when
it
concerns
lithium
extraction
we
do
not
need
to
speed
up
this
process.
Mining
operations
in
general
are
fundamentally
harmful
to
our
environment,
so
we
need
to
approach
this
matter
with
caution.
The
proposed
lithium
extraction
in
Maine
raises
some
initial
concern.
First
and
foremost,
the
method
of
extraction
is
more
harmful
than
other
types.
The
proposed
lithium
extraction
in
Maine
would
require
an
open
pit
mine,
which
is
considered
to
be
the
most
environmentally
harmful
of
the
ways
to
extract
lithium,
according
to
a
Nature
Conservancy
report
.
In
that
report,
they
state

that
surface
mining
has
an
intense
disturbance
and
conversion
of
natural
lands.
They
also
noted
the
potential
impact
on
vegetation,
soil
health,
plants
and
animals.
Moreover ,
the
proposal
in
question
would
also
require
the
extraction
of
spodumene,
which
then
must
go
through
an
ener getically
and
chemically
intensive
process.
Most
of
the
lithium
extraction
in
the
United
States
comes
through
brines,
which
significantly
reduces
groundwater
impact
and
comes
without
the
environmental
costs
of
surface
mining.
I
mention
this
because
there
are
numerous
factors
and
concerns
that
must
be
addressed
before
we
ponder
the
idea
of
loosening
regulations.
Mining
laws
in
our
state
are
ar guably
the
strongest
in
the
nation,
so
loosening
restrictions
requires
a
period
of
time
to
evaluate.
Therefore,
it
makes
LD
1495
and
1508
important
in
order
to
ensure
our
due
diligence.
These
bills
will
allow
us
time
to
consider
our
positions
and
provide
us
an
opportunity
to
examine
any
environmental
harm
associated
with
this
activity .
When
you
are
considering
your
position
today ,
I
encourage
you
to
seriously
factor
in
the
youth’ s
voice.
This
decision
is
not
going
to
immediately
impact
our
state;
instead,
the
results
will
be
ones
that
my
generation
will
have
to
deal
with.
Therefore,
considering
the
stake
the
youth
have
in
this
issue,
I
ur ge
the
committee
to
exercise
caution
and
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1495
and
1508,
as
well
as
vote
“ought
not
to
pass”
on
LD
1433
and
1476.
I
thank
you
for
your
time
and
service.
