LD 1508 An Act to Ensure a Strategic Approach to Maineâ€™s Energy Transition by 
Imposing a Moratorium on Lithium Mining
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and the Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources my name is Arleigh Kraus I am a registered cannabis caregiver 
with a B.S. in biochemistry, an organic farmer, and business owner in Warren. I am a 
board member of Maine based Citizens against Residential Mining Activities 
(CARMA) and a concerned citizen scientist. 
I am presenting testimony today in favor of LD 1508.
Research into appropriate regulations for the mining of lithium from deposits found in
Maine would benefit from the passage of this bill.  A moratorium to facilitate studies 
and education of mining matters and allow for the legislature to learn from mining 
experts before making changes to state mining laws (especially metallic mineral 
mining) is necessary.
Please support ought to pass LD 1508
Respectfully,
Arleigh A. Kraus
