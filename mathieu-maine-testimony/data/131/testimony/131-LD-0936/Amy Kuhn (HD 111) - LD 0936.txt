District  111: Falmouth  (part)  
  
    March  21, 2023  
    Testimony  of Rep. Amy Kuhn  in support  of  
LD 936, An Act to Require  Disclosure  of Pay Ranges  and Record  
Keeping  of Pay History  
Before  the Joint  Standing  Committee  on Labor  and Housing  
 
Senator  Tipping,  Representative  Roeder,  esteemed  members  of the Labor  and Housing  
Committee.  My name  is Amy  Kuhn  and I proudly  represent  House  District  111, which  is the 
Town  of Falmouth.  It is my pleasure  to submit  testimony  in support  of LD 936, An Act to 
Require  Disclosure  of Pay Ranges  and Record  Keeping  of Pay History . 
 
Nationally,  women  working  full-time are on average  paid 82 cents  for every  dollar  paid to men.1 
The wage  gap is even  starker  for women  of color.  In 2020,  African  American  women  made  64 
cents  on the dollar,  and Latinas  just 57 cents  on the dollar  compared  to white,  non-Hispanic  
men.  The number  is even  lower  for Native  American  women.2 
 
One of the primary  causes  of this gap is the lack of transparency  in pay structures  within  
organization s. Pay transparency  will require  employers  to disclose  salary  information  offered  to 
candidates  in advance,  reducing  the potential  for gender  and racial  discrimination  in the 
workplace.  
 
Pay transparency  is also beneficial  for employers,  enabling  them  to operate  more  efficiently,  
avoiding  participating  in interviews  with potential  employees  who would  not take the job if they 
were  aware  of the anticipated  salary.   
 
Pay transparency  is fair for workers,  efficient  for employers  and good  for Maine.  I urge you to 
vote Ought  to Pass  on LD 936. 
 
Thank  you for your consideration.
