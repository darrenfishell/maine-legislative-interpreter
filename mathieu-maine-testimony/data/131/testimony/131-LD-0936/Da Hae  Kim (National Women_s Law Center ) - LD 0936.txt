Testimony Of 
 Da Hae Kim, S tate Policy Senior Counsel, Workplace Justice and Education  
National Women’s Law Center  
In SUPPORT Of Legislative Document (L.D.) 936  
Before the Maine Committee of Labor and Housing  
 
March 21, 2023  
 
Thank you for the opportun ity to submit this testimony on behalf of the National Women’s Law 
Center. NWLC has been working since 1972 to help women and families achieve economic 
security. We work closely with state policymakers across the country to streng then laws for 
closing gend er and racial pay gaps. Pay transparency laws, like Legislative Document 936 , have 
been identified as a leading tool for closing gender and racial pay gaps.  
In recent years, Maine  has taken a critical step towards helping employers de -bias their pay-
setting  practices  by prohibiting  employers from asking job applicants  for their salary  history . By 
requiring employers to include pay ranges in job announcements, L.D. 936  will build on this 
progress and give employers and employees a tool to help close gender and racial wage gaps and 
more efficie ntly and effectively recruit and retain talent .  
A rapidly growing chorus of states and localities have passed and/or implemented laws 
specifically requiring pay r anges to be included in job postings: Washington, Colorado, New 
York, California , New York City, Ithaca, NY; Westchester County, NY; and Jerse y City, NJ. 
Four more states —Nevada, Maryland, Connecticut, and Rhode Island —require employers to 
provide pay rang es at some point in the hiring process . Connecticut, Rho de Island,  and 
California have also required  employers to provide pay rang es to employees  during their tenure . 
This year, nearly twenty states are considering pay range transparency legislation . 
 
I. Pay range transparency helps close gender and racial pay gaps  
 
We all want to feel confident that we are being paid fairly. But when an e mployer doesn’t  
provide job applicants the pay range for positions, women lose out. For example, research shows 
that pay negotiations are notoriously unfavorable to women: Women who neg otiate are  
perceived as greedy and not team players; in addition , because women are typically coming from  
roles where they are paid less, women often ask for less than their equally qualified male  
counterparts.i

 For women of color  who, on average, experience the largest wage gaps , research shows that they  
often  state dramatically lower minimum salary requirements than white men, white women, and 
men of color.ii   
      
Fortunately, research shows that  when job applicants are clearly informed about the con text for 
negotiations, including the pay range, gender gaps in negotiations diminish, which could help 
narrow gender pay gaps.iii Being required to post pay ranges in job announcements also prompts 
employers to proactively review and evaluate their compensa tion practices and address any 
unjustified disparities between employees.   
 
Likewise, secrecy about pay  masks  and per petuates  gender pay gaps for employees. Providing 
employees with compensation information helps  employees  evaluate whether they are being paid 
fairly  and work with their employers to resolve pay disparities.  
 
A growing line of research points to a reduction in gender pay gaps and increased pay for women 
after states and/or employers have enacted pay transparency policies.iv  Research also  sugge sts 
that pay range transparency helps raise wages for low -paid workers.v The much  narrower pay 
gaps in unionized and public sector positions where pay structures are typically  transparent 
provide  further evidence that greater pay transparency help s reduc e pay disparities. vi 
 
II. Businesses —small and large alike —have found that including pay  ranges in job 
announcements helps attract and retain talent and save time and costs in hiring  
 
More and more employers have begun to include pay ranges in their job postings as it becomes  
starkly clear that doing so is crucial to attracting talent .vii A recent survey by the Society of 
Human Resource Management found that 70% of organizations that list pay ranges on job 
postings say that doing so has led to mo re people a pplying to their postings , nearly two -thirds 
(66%) found an increase in the quality of applicants, and 65% stated that doing so makes them 
more competitive in attracting top talent.viii  
 
Pay range transparency is especially  crucial for attracting  Gen Z talen t. Adobe’s Future 
Workforce Study of upcoming college seniors  and recent college grads revealed 85%  of those 
surveyed  are less likely to apply for a job if the company does not  disclose the salary range in the 
job posting.ix Moreover, survey af ter survey ha s shown that an  overwhelming majority of job 
candidates prefer to work at a company that discloses pay  information and almost all candidates 
believe an employer should disclose pay ranges in job  announcements.x Pay transparency is also 
shown to promote emp loyee trust, loyalty , and productivity, which helps retain talent  and is 
good for employers’ bottom line.xi  Also, b y leveling the negotiating playing field, pay range 
transparency helps employers avoid gender and racial wage gaps from arising to begin with  and 
thus avoid liability.  
 
Including pay ranges in job announcements also helps employers avoid wasting time culling  
and interviewing candidates  who would not accept the position because the pay does not meet  
their expectations. Research shows that it als o helps reduce online recruiting costs .xii

 We’ve  heard from small businesses  that don’t have an HR team that it is crucial for  them to 
include  pay ranges in job postings given that  they have limited  resources and time available to 
hire. Not surprisingly , research shows that small  businesses  already tend to share their pay 
ranges .xiii Smaller businesses also appreciate when pay range tran sparency laws  require 
employers to provide a “general description of benefits  and other compensation to be offe red” as 
it allows them to give a fuller picture of what they can offer beyond pay.  Given th e benefits  for 
small business , and th e eas e of complian ce—just be transparent about what you are generally 
hoping and willing to pay —it is important that this law applies  to all employers, regardless 
of size.  
 
Colorado, the first state to pass a pay range transparency law, saw a high compliance rate among 
its 50 largest employers right after the law’s passage, and nearly two years later, conti nues to 
enjoy even higher rates of compliance.xiv A study analyzing the impact of Colorado’s salary 
range transparency law found that, on average, the state experienced a greater increase in its 
labor force participation rate than Utah, a neighboring state with similar economic and 
demographic characteristics.xv  
 
Unfortunately, many employers, especially in the private  sector, are still not transparent about  
how much a position pays. Even if an employer doesn’t have formal pay ranges for particular  
roles, employers usually budget a gene ral amount or range for the position for which they are  
hiring. Pay range transparency laws simply ask employers to share that  information with  
applicants. Already, according to a PayScale survey, 86% of surveyed employers have a  
compensation structure in place or are working to develop one and around 68% of respondents  
stated they share their salary ranges with current employees ,xvi demonstrating that pay range  
transparency is possible.  
 
III. Conclusion  
We urge the members of this Committee to show up for Maine  businesses and working people 
by supporting L.D. 936.
