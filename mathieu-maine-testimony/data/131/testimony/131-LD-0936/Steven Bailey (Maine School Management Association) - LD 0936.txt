TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 936 
 
AN ACT TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF PAY RANGES AND RECORD KEEPING OF PAY HISTORY  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committ ee on Labor and Housing . I am Steven 
Bailey, executive director  for Maine  School Management Association , testifying on behalf o f the legislative 
committees of  the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents Association in 
opposition to  L.D. 936. 
 
We are opposed to this legislation because it puts a burdensome mandate on schools in terms of keeping track 
of the payment history essentially for all school employees, since we can think of few examples where there 
are less than 10. It also is unnecessary.  
 
Labor contracts negotiated with our employees and their union representative are a matter of public record 
since they are negotiated with the School Board. Hourly wages for non -union employees also are a matter of 
public record since we are public entities.  
 
We also think it is burdensome on any organizat ion to be required to maintain payment history for three years 
after an employee has move d on or retired.  
 
For these reasons we oppose this bill and also ask for clarification on whether it was intended to include all 
public employees, which also would inc lude state employees.
