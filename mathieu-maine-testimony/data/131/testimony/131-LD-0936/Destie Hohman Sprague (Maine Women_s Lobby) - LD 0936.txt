Senator Tipping , Representative Roeder , and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing ,  
I join you today on behalf of the Maine Women’s Lobby. For over forty years, the Maine 
Women’s Lobby has advocated for gender -responsive and gender -equitable public policies, with 
a focus on those most affected by misogyny, sexism, and other forms of oppression. We support 
systems and proposals which increase the health, wellness, safety, and economic securit y of all 
people in Maine.  We are before you today In Support of LD 936 , An Act to Require 
Disclosure of Pay Ranges and Record Keeping of Pay History .  
Just 7 days ago, Governor Mills declared March 14 Equal Pay Day1. The first line of the press 
release reads: According to the United States Census Bureau, the difference between median 
earnings for men and wom en in Maine who worked full -time, year -round in 2021 was $9,991 . 
The release goes on to share that nationally , that gap is as much as $28,797 for American 
Indian and Alaska Native women.2 
That disparity has actually widened s ince 2016.3 
There are many reasons for this – women are more likely to take time out of the work force for 
unpaid caregiving labor within their family or community .4 Women are more likely to work in 
low-wage , female -dominated  roles – and still make less money than men working within those 
roles.5  
But this is also simply structura l, relating to  salary history (inequity perpetuates inequity), salary 
negotiations which disfavor women, and expectations around silence  on the topic of wages. But 
we don’t have to live with those structures.  
Creating systems of salary transparency is one of the least burdensome and most impactful 
ways we can turn this tide.  With virtually no impact  on the part of the employer, salary 
transparency laws have been shown to  move the needle on the pay gap. Research shows  reduce d 
gender pay gaps and increased wages for women after states and/or employers have enacted pay 
transparency policies.6 It also helps businesses attract talent. A recent study shows that upcoming

 college seniors and recent college grads are 85% are less lik ely to apply for a job if the company 
does not disclose the salary range in the job posting.7  
We would like to share that we support the proposed amendment to make this universal  
(rather than exempting some employers). Small businesses are  often  already doing this, in large 
part because they see the results it has on recruitment ,8 and it helps save time in the hiring 
process.  
As a small employer myself, and the person in our organization in charge of employment 
systems and job posting, I know that it costs me nothing in terms of time and effort to post my 
salary ranges, but significantly improves our ability to attract employee s, makes negotiation 
faster and easier, and helps my team feel valued and informed.  
We hope you will vote Ought to Pass on LD 936.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
 
Destie Hohman Sprague, Executive Director
