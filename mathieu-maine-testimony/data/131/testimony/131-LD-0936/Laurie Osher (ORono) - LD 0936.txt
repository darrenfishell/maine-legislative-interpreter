T estimony

in
support
of
LD
936:
An
Act
to
Requir e
Disclosur e
of
Pay
Ranges
and
Record
Keeping
of
Pay
History
Before
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing
Senator
Tipping,
Representative
Roeder ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Labor
and
Housing
Committee.
I
am
Laurie
Osher
and
I
represent
District
25,
the
majority
of
Orono.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
express
my
support
for
LD
936:
An
Act
to
Requir e
Disclosur e
of
Pay
Ranges
and
Record
Keeping
of
Pay
History
.
Including
salary
information
in
job
advertisements
will
help
to
ensure
that
the
hiring
process
by
Maine
companies
is
more
transparent
and
more
fair.
I
support
this
bill
because
posting
salary
ranges
with
job
announcements
is
widely
considered
a
best
practice
for
diversity ,
equity ,
and
inclusion
(DEI).
Salary
transparency
helps
ensure
that
employees
are
not
underpaid
or
overpaid
based
on
factors
such
as
race,
gender ,
or
other
characteristics
that
should
not
impact
pay.
Maine
Labor
law
has
prohibited
potential
employers
from
asking
job
applicants
about
their
salary
history
since
2019.
You
can
find
that
in
Title
26,
Chapter
7,
Subchapter
2,
628-A-2.
That
law
was
enacted
because
social
scientists
had
demonstrated
that
employers
were
offering
compensation
based
on
the
applicant's
previous
earnings,
not
based
on
the
wages
being
paid
to
other
employees
doing
the
same
job
in
their
company .
I
support
this
bill
because
I’ve
experienced
and
witnessed
salary
discrepancy
in
too
many
workplaces,
including
here
in
Maine.
It’s
unfair ,
and
here
in
Maine
it
isn’t
the
way
our
citizens’ s
economic
life
should
be.
I
support
this
bill
because
I
would
like
Maine
to
join
the
cities,
counties
and
other
states
that
have
enacted
this
salary
transparency
law.
