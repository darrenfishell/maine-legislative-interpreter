Re: Testimony in Support of LD 1283, Resolve, To Reestablish the Task Force to Study the 
Creation of a Comprehensive Career and Technical Education System  
 
 
Senator Rafferty , Representative Brennan and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs.  My name is Beck y Smith. I am the Director of Government and 
Community Relations for the Maine Community College System.  Please  accept  this testimony 
in support of LD 1283.  We would also like to offer a friendly amendment to the Resolve before 
you. 
 
The Resolve seeks to reestablish a task force that will stud y the creation of a comprehensive CTE 
system.  A similar measure passed the legisl ature d uring the 130th but was never implemented. 
We are included as members of this task force, appointed by the Governor.  If your committee 
and the legislature chooses to  move forward with this current Resolve, we will be more than 
happy to participate.  We feel w e have a lot to offer this task force and welcome the opportunity 
to collaborate.  
 
However, the language in the current draft  states that the member is “an administrator at a 
community college.”  We ask that the language be changed to match that of the language used 
for the University of Maine System.  Our proposed language is “an admi nistrator at the Maine 
Community College System.”  This would allow the most flexibility  so the Governor could  name 
the best representative.  The language used in the final Resolve last year did include our proposed 
language , not the language before you today.  
 
Thank you for your time and attention.
