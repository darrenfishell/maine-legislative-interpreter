Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs 
April 24, 2023 
  
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee,  
 
My name is Grace Leavitt. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am serving as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51. I have over 43 years of 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certified teacher. The MEA represents 
nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well as in our 
institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine Community 
College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as well as many retired educators. 
 
I am here to testify on behalf of MEA in support of LD 1283, Resolve, to Reestablish the Task Force to 
Study the Creation of a Comprehensive Career and Technical Education System. 
 
It had been our understanding that this Task Force was to have been meeting in the fall of 2022. I had 
actually been appointed to serve on the Task Force as one of the seven members appointed by the 
Governor. When I asked when the Task Force would begin to meet, I was informed that it would not be 
meeting as planned. The reason given was that it had not been funded, yet that remains somewhat 
unclear. Thus we are not surprised to see LD 1283 this session, and we are hopeful that the Task Force 
will again be formed and that the work will get underway in a timely fashion.  
 
MEA understands the importance of career and technical education and realizes that there are potential 
barriers for some students to pursue their education in these areas. We are very supportive of finding 
ways to address such barriers to improve access for students to career and technical studies while we 
continue to provide the well-rounded education that Maineâ€™s high school diploma requirements ensure 
so that our students graduate prepared for their post-secondary lives, whichever direction they may take. 
 
 
We urge your support of LD 1283.
