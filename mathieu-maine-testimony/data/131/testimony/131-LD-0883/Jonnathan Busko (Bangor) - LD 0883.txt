Tes$mony of Dr. Jonnathan Busko, MD, MPH  a Resident of Bangor, Maine, in support of LD 883, An Act to Exempt Emergency Medical Services Community Paramedicine Programs from Home Health Care Provider Licensing Requirements   March 21, 2023  Dear Senator Baldacci, Representa$ve Meyer, and members of the CommiNee on Health and Human Services,   I’m Jonnathan Busko, an emergency physician living in Bangor.  I am the medical director for two EMS agencies that provide community paramedicine services and have been involved with the EMS prac$ce of community paramedicine since its incep$on in the early 1990’s when it was called expanded scope of service and prac$ce EMS.  I am also the designer of and medical director for the “Jackman Cri$cal Access Physician Extender Project,” a demonstra$on project using telehealth and advanced prac$ce paramedics to assure that Moose River Valley residents have 24-hour a day access to urgent and emergency care services, and have been involved in a number of other health care services access projects over the years in Maine’s rural and fron$er communi$es.   Timely access to all aspects of healthcare, including home-based services, is vital to maintain individual health and community stability.  This is par$cularly true in historically underserved seYngs including rural and fron$er communi$es as well as for un- and underinsured individuals.  While the concept of emergency medical services conjures images of ﬂashing lights and life-saving procedures, the reality is that the majority of EMS is low-acuity care.  More fundamental, however, is that EMS is the touchstone of healthcare in almost every community in Maine and across the US.  As health access becomes more challenging, EMS is o]en called upon to be the “spackle” that ﬁlls the gaps in the healthcare system and has risen to that role.   While Maine EMS began discussing community paramedicine in the late 2000’s and full authoriza$on for “unrestricted” community paramedicine became law in 2017 (MRS Title 32§84.4), the concept of EMS providing non-emergency episodic care under the direc$on of a physician to provide for unmet community needs has been in prac$ce for almost 35 years.  In some early programs, such as community vaccina$on programs and home safety  assessments, the EMS clinicians applied  procedures within their already authorized scope of prac$ce.  In other cases, physician and EMS leaders iden$ﬁed that the medical needs of communi$es exceeded the tradi$onal scope of prac$ce of an EMS provider and, using the statutory powers aﬀorded to them and to state EMS agencies, acted to appropriately expand those scopes of prac$ce.  In many cases, the ini$al focus of such programs was to iden$fy, during EMS emergency responses, low acuity pa$ents who did not require EMS transport to a hospital and for whom alternate, non-emergency care or services were appropriate.  Other programs, however, recognized that EMS assets were o]en engaged to be wai$ng and that this excess capacity could be put to use in the community, addressing unmet healthcare needs before they became emergencies.  In almost all cases, however, there was limited or no reimbursement for these services and many of the pa$ents were either 
uninsured or did not meet insurance eligibility requirements for the preven$ve and health maintenance services they needed.   Since the ﬁrst community paramedicine pilot projects were authorized in Maine, community paramedicine agencies have worked in partnership with healthcare systems, home health agencies, physicians, PAs, nurse prac$$oners, social services agencies, and community beneﬁt organiza$ons to iden$fy and serve pa$ents’ unmet non-emergency healthcare needs.  In par$cular, these agencies have worked closely with home health agencies to meet the needs of pa$ents who clearly have home health needs but either don’t meet insurance eligibility requirements or, for logis$cal reasons, cannot be served by a home health agency.  Addi$onally, the EMS agencies have provided services that do not fall into the bailiwick of tradi$onal home health such a food delivery and hea$ng assistance program referrals, and yet are o]en the services most needed by pa$ents to allow them to live in home seYngs.   I’m the hospital representa$ve to the Maine EMS Community Paramedicine SubcommiNee, and, using a community paramedicine perspec$ve, over the last 3 years we have been evalua$ng the unmet non-emergency health care needs of Mainers.  We’ve looked at community paramedicine prac$ce across the United States, both from a scope of prac$ce and a regulatory perspec$ve.  And over the last year, this subcommiNee has developed regulatory, educa$onal, creden$aling, and scope of prac$ce recommenda$ons for the Maine EMS Board.  The inten$on of this work is to create a formal, regulated framework for community paramedicine that makes EMS agencies valuable supplemental partners to other healthcare en$$es including hospitals, primary care providers, home health and hospice agencies, social services en$$es, and municipal governments.   Having spent the last 5 years of my career working with some of the most isolated communi$es in Maine to iden$fy their health care access needs, I ﬁrmly believe that community paramedicine is a cri$cal piece of Maine’s healthcare system.  I also believe that, given Maine EMS’ authority to license, regulate, and oversee EMS prac$ce, including community paramedicine, community paramedicine should not be considered home health nor fall under the oversight of the Department of Health and Human Services.  However, I also recognize the DHHS has a long history of licensing home health agencies and, as such, is an authorita$ve voice regarding best prac$ces in the oversight of the delivery of non-emergency care in pa$ents’ homes.  Therefore, I would recommend amending LD 883 to require Maine EMS to work with DHHS to develop func$onal parity in the licensing requirements of home health care providers and Community Paramedicine agencies, again with the regulatory oversight for Community Paramedicine agencies (and the providers working therein) under Maine EMS.  Sincerely,  Jonnathan Busko MD, MPH
