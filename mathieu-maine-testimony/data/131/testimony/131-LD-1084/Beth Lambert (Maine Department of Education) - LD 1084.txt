LD 1084, An Act to Enhance Wildlife Conservation Efforts and Preserve Sporting Heritage by 
Making the Elements of a Hunter Safety Course a Part of Public  School Curriculum , proposes to 
require elements of Maine hunter safety to be t aught no later than grade 9 in public and private 
schools. Successful completion will result in issuance of Maine hunter safety certification.   
As indicated in Title 20 -A, §2(2), the control and management of the public schools shall be 
vested in the legi slative and governing bodies of local school administrative units, as long as 
those units are in compliance with appropriate state statutes. This policy of “local control” 
provides communities with a stronger v oice in critical decisions in how education is  to be 
provided.  Under this statute the State cannot specify courses, content, or programs to be taught in schools.   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1084 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work sessi on.  
 
 Sincerely,  
 
Beth Lambert  
Director of Innovative Instruction
