My name is Rebecca Grooms, I have been employed with the State of Maine for 21 Â½ years, and I am 
writing on my own time to share my thoughts on the biennial budget  and the need to close the state 
employee pay gap.  
For the past 10 years, the State of Maine has offered new employees the opportunity to start out at step 
3 or 4 depending on the office.   However, there has not been any compensation for those employees 
who have been loyal to the State.   We have weathered years of pay raise and hiring freezes, shut down 
days and retirement incentives payouts of $10,000.  
I have heard that employees do not care to show up.  In reality, we are tired.  Tired of fighting for 
equitable pay, tired of being set aside, after giving our loyalty to State of Maine, and receiving little to no 
loyalty (compensation) in return.   
I am asking for equitable pay increases.   Whereas, the new employees are starting at step 4, the starting 
pay (step 1) and additional steps should be added to each pay grade.   All employees should receive a 
raise.  If we want to retain dedicated workers, we need to work to close the pay gap and ensure 
everyone is paid fairly for the important work they do.  
Thank yo u for your consideration.
