Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Tipping, 
Representative Roeder, and members of the 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Labor and 
Housing Committees, my name is Mike McGonigle, I live 
in Hampden, and I’m a State of Maine retiree and a 
member of MSEA.
 
Please fund a full, cumulative cost-of-living adjustment in 
the biennial budget. Inflation has increased substantially in 
the last few years, and MePERS retirees have never been 
made whole after the 2011 cuts.
 
My recent monthly bill from Versant Power’s “standard 
offer” for electricity supply has increased from $0.11684 to 
$0.16438. This is a 33.8098% difference now and going 
forward for me and other MSEA and MePERS retirees. It 
is a hardship for myself and surely for other MSEA 
retirees.
 
This is just one example of how retirees with a fixed 
income are struggling with rising costs. Please keep this in 
mind when working on the budget and take steps to help 
MePERS retirees keep up with these increased costs by 
fully funding a cumulative COLA.
Thank you for your work behalf MSEA Retirees.
Mike McGonigle,  Electronic Signature 02/08/2023
