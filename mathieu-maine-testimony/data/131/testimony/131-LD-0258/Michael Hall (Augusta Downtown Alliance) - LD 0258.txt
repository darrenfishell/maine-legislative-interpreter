Dear Honorable  Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial 
Affairs  
 
My name is Michael Hall and I’m the Executive Director for the Augusta Downtown Alliance.  
 For the past ten years, Maine Downtown Center has been an invaluable asset  in our quest to 
transform Downtown Augusta into a vibrant and burgeoning center for food, art and entertainment. With the help of their guidance  and educational seminars, we’ve been able to gain 
the tools necessary to develop our city center in a responsible way without compromising its historic character. I myself have relied on their advice numerous times, particularly when it comes to conducting research, and dealing with difficul t situations arising from revitalization.  
 I truly believe that without the guidance of MDC, the Augusta Downtown Alliance would be a mere shadow of itself as an organization. I therefore implore you to continue their funding.  
 Sincerely,  
 
Michael Hall
