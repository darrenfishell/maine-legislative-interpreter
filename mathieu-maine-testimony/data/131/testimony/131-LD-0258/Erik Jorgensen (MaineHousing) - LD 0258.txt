February 9, 2023 (IPM) 
Senators Rotundo and Pierce, Representatives Sachs and Gere, and Members of the Appropriations 
and Housing committees, my name is Erik Jorgensen, Director of Government Relations and 
Communications at MaineHousing. 
The Maine State Housing Authority is Maine’s housing finance agency, created by the legislature in 
1969 to address the problems of unsafe, unsuitable, overcrowded, and unaffordable housing. We are 
authorized to issue bonds to finance single-family and multi-family housing for Maine’s low and 
moderate income citizens. These bonds carry the moral obligation of the state; they are repaid from 
mortgage payments, not the General Fund. We are not part of state government, but are structured 
as an independent agency to utilize effective private methods of ﬁnance for public purposes, to be 
independent, and responsive. 
We are also authorized to act for the state in administering several federal programs, including rental 
subsidies, Weatherization and fuel assistance, two housing block grants, the low-income housing tax 
credit program, and homeless grant programs. We receive state general fund revenue for homeless 
programs and receive a dedicated portion of the real estate transfer tax for the Housing Opportunities 
for Maine (HOME) Fund to support our programs.

The context for today’s budget hearing is worth noting, as we are emerging from a period of 
unprecedented program and subsidy funding. In 2021 alone, MaineHousing provided more than 
$557 million dollars to Maine people in the form of Home Purchase assistance, Housing 
Development subsidy, Energy Assistance, Rental Assistance and Homeless Assistance. Whﬂe we have 
not yet reported our ﬁgures for 2022, this period will, in all likelihood, be a high-water mark for our 
agency’s programmatic funding, which has entered a period of contraction as pandemic era special 
programs are winding down. 
We have worked closely with state government in coordinating these investments, including additional 
special initiative funding made available from the state, such as that which you funded earlier last 
month in LD 3. For making all of this unprecedented investment possible, we would like to express 
our appreciation for the partnerships we have had with the Appropriations Committee, with DAFS 
and with our colleagues in the Governor ’s office. 
Our state funding, while not comprising the majority of our agency’s budget, provides absolutely 
critical resources to help in meeting Maine’s housing needs. This is the only money that the housing 
authority receives that is not strictly designated for specific, federally-defined purposes, and so it has 
particular importance as a part of our budget, as it enables us to be responsive in meeting emergent 
needs. 
Mainel-Iousing has ﬁve items in the biennial budget starting on page A431. 
The Housing Opportunities for Maine Fund — The HOME Fund (account 0442) 
The ﬁrst item in our budget is the HOME Fund, and that appears on Page A-432 as an other special 
revenue account. The HOME fund was created in 1983 to provide a dedicated and flexible source of 
funding for affordable housing. It’s our largest and I daresay most mission-critical source of state 
revenue. It was created with the support of the Realtors, bankers, and others in the industry who got 
behind a doubling of the real estate transfer tax to provide that revenue. 10% of the tax stays with the 
county that collects it as an agent fee, and the balance is split between the General Fund and the 
HOME Fund.
2
One of the unique features of this Fund is that when the real estate markets are hot and the people we 
serve need more assistance, the amount of money in the fund increases. Conversely, when the market 
is soft and rents and prices might be more affordable, we get less. The fact remains, however, that 
need always exceeds resources. 
Over the years, the legislature has repeatedly diverted funds, totaling over $80 million, from the 
HOME fund to provide funding for other needs in the budget. That was NOT the case in the last 
budget cycle, nor for this proposed budget, and for that we are very grateful. 
The legislature receives a detailed biennial report from us on the HOME fund, and that will be 
coming to you in April. But I can tell you a bit about the fund here, to give you a sense of what it 
does. 
Last year the HOME Fund funded $24,340,119 in expenditures. This was spread among a variety of 
housing programs — around 19% of that was used to support first-time homebuyers, providing down- 
payment assistance for people buying their ﬁrst single-family home. In this category, the fund also 
supported foreclosure avoidance programrning, mobile home replacement, and housing counseling. 
Another 21% paid for services for owners of substandard homes, and t_his covered well water 
contaminant abatement, lead remediation, and several home repair programs, including general 
repairs, repairs to make a house ready for weatherization, repairs to properties beingrented to section 
8 tenants, and repairs for homes owned by older Mainers, including the Community Aging in Place 
program that provides home modiﬁcations to improve accessibility. 
The next 25% of the funds supported services for the homeless — our shelter operating subsidy, 
incentives for landlords to rent to people coming out of homelessness, eviction prevention, rapid-re- 
housing services and our navigator program, as well as support for Maine’s redesigned system of 
homeless service coordination, now centered around nine service hubs. 
13°/o of the funding supported shelter repair and supportive housing services,
3
and the remaining 25% of the funds were used to provide subsidy for new unit construction, and 
other activities relating to the creation and preservation of affordable housing. 
This is just a snapshot showing one year of the HUME Fund, but my hope here was to illustrate the 
range of activities it supports as the only ﬂexible money MaineHousing has. You will ﬁnd we will 
always oppose efforts to specifically direct how we spend these funds, because we have to to maintain 
that flexibility. I should also point out that 100% of these funds go to program. None is used for 
MaineHousing ’s administration or overhead. 
Moving down the page, there are two INITIATIVES in this part of the budget. The ﬁrst one simply 
reconciles the HOME fund budget to the revenue projections for ﬁscal years 23-24 and 24-25. The 
revenue forecast predicts a reduction in the overall amount of real estate transfer tax revenue. This 
means a reduction to the HOME fund of $4,649,526 in the ﬁrst year and $4,816,650 in the second 
year. 
The second initiative is one we are very enthusiastic about, and relates to Language Item PART TT. 
Part TT Provides $30,000,000 from the General Fund Unallocated Surplus to provide subsidy to 
expand rental housing options that are affordable to workers and their families, split equally between 
the Rural Affordable Rental Housing Program and the Low-income Housing Tax credit program. All 
the available subsidy for these programs was used almost immediately when it was made available 
through the Maine Jobs and Recovery Act, so we know that demand for these resources in this 
budget will be high. And taken as a whole we project that this $30 I\/[illion will subsidize upwards of 
250 new affordable units. 
The $15 million in rural program funding will leverage other ﬁnancing in those projects, and the $15 
million designated for the tax credit program will leverage federal Low Income Housing Tax 
Credits. Our experience in the ﬁrst round of the Rural Rental Program suggests that units created 
through that program need roughly $1 50K/ unit in subsidy, so $15Million should produce another 
hundred units or so. Witli regard to the 4% tax credit (LIHTEC), those projects require around 
$110,000 per unit in subsidy (this is mostly due to the fact that these tend to be larger projects and so 
there are economies of scale), so we can expect the other $15 Million to generate about 150 units.
4
There are two points I want to make about this initiative. First, is that there is a budget error. 
Language Part TT speciﬁes that this is a $30MM initiative, while the corresponding ﬁgure on page A- 
432 shows it as a one-time appropriation of $25,000,000. We have discussed this discrepancy with 
both the administration and the bureau of the budget and they agree that the intended amount is 
$30,000,000 as shown in Part TT, and that this we understand, will be corrected in the change 
package. 
The second point is more of a contextual one, and that is to note that this is the ﬁrst time that there 
has ever been a direct appropriation for housing subsidy included in a biennial budget. We are 
extremely grateful to the Governor for adding this line — subsidy is the special ingredient that puts the 
“affordable ” into affordable housing. We can bond and provide attractive mortgages all day, but those 
are not enough to make the numbers work if you if you are buying land, building a project and 
charging long-term reduced rents. 
Thanks to the historic level of attention of the 130* Legislature and this Administration, we have 
never had a larger production pipeline in our agency’s history. There are 87 projects currently in our 
overall pipeline, representing 3,623 apartment units at some stage in production. From our 
perspective that’s an amazing number, but what might be of greatest interest to you is the sheer 
number of those projects that were made possible thanks to state support. There is a chart appended 
to my testimony that shows those state-supported projects in detail. ’A 
Low Income Energy Assis tance Program (account 0708) 
The next item is a placeholder account for the Low Income Assistance Program, and it is found on 
page A-433. This program is commonly referred to as LIAP and it provides a discount for low 
income electricity consumers. This should not be confused with LIHEAP or HEAP, which is our 
federally funded heating assistance program. (W e would suggest the title of this be changed to 
remove “Energy” from its name). The Public Utilities Commission created LIAP for the electric 
utilities, and funding for it comes from electrical ratepayers. PUC asked MaineHousing to coordinate 
the ﬂow of funds among the utility companies and the Community Action Agencies, which we do. At 
the time it was created there was some discussion about the state contributing funds as well. That
5
hasn’t happened yet; but this account stands ready, as the vehicle for that. To put this in perspective, 
around 30,000 people took part in this program last year. There are no initiatives in this program. 
The Maine Energy, Housing, and Economic Recovery Program (account Z124) 
The next item is The Maine Energy, Housing, and Economic Recovery Program, or what are also 
known as “Part E Bonds” . This program appears on page A-433. This program was created in 2009 
with the aim of constructing or substantially rehabilitating energy efficient affordable rental housing, 
to replace pre-1976 substandard manufactured housing units; and to create jobs. We are authorized to 
sell $30,000,000 or more in bonds per year with a cap of $200,000,000, but we only issue enough 
bonds to meet the level of debt service that’s available. Those bonds are repaid from the state’s share 
of the real estate transfer tax, and this line reﬂects the debt service for those bonds due over the 
biennium. 
I am pleased to report we recently restructured the debt in this program and issued new bonds ata 
substantially lower interest rate. This allowed us to provide an additional $36,000,000 in new subsidy, 
while holding the state’s annual debt service payment level. The $4,318, 538 shown as an Other~ 
Special Revenue line in the budget represents payments on those bonds over the next two years. They 
are paid for through the portion of the real estate transfer tax that does not ﬂow to the HOME fund. 
There is a small INITIATIVE in this section and it simply reconciles the budget to the bond payment 
schedule. t e"
~ 
Shelter Operating Subsidy (account 0661) 
Finally, the last MaineHousing item appears on page A-434 and is The Shelter Operating Subsidy. 
This is our only ongoing general fund line and these funds support operating costs for emergency 
homeless shelters across the state. The line was ﬁrst funded in 1988 at $500,000. In the 126*‘ 
Legislature, the Labor and Housing Committee worked very hard to increase this appropriation to 
$2,500,000 - and the Appropriations Committee worked hard to include it in the budget. The. 
Governor continues this funding in this year’s budget proposal.
6
I think it’s important to note that MaineHousing ’s support of shelters goes beyond this line. In 
addition to this $2,500,000, MaineHousing adds funding from HUD’s Emergency Solutions Grant 
program (currently $1,283,470 in federal funds, not shown in the State Budget), and $3,500,000 from 
the HOME Fund. We combine these funds together to create the Emergency Shelter and Housing 
Assistance Program (we call it ESHAP), which supports shelter operations and housing stabilization 
services. It also includes a performance incentive to assist shelters ir1 reporting the most accurate data 
on the clients they serve. 
One other relevant item around shelters relates to LD 3, which you passed last month. We have been 
working very quickly to deploy our portion of that funding in terms of heating assistance and 
emergency shelter. Within a few days of that bill being signed we had posted two notices of funding 
availability - the ﬁrst for short term overnight warming shelters this winter, and the other for longer 
term capacity enhancements that will enable homeless shelter providers to accommodate more 
people. The ﬁrst of those N OFA’s closed last Friday; we had 17 proposals which we reviewed over 
the weekend; we scored them on Monday and are preparing to finalize awards by tomorrow. We will 
be funding about a dozen of these and are working with some of the other applicants to fmd a way to 
get to yes. The other category closes at the end of the month, and we will work to turn those around 
as quickly as possible. LD 3 is not part of this budget, of course, but we wanted to report on that 
progress. 
This concludes my testimony. We appreciate your time and your interest in our programs. Thank you.
