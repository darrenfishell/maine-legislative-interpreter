To me, being fully staffed and funded means greater access to support and services to the 
children and families we serve at CDS, happier staff members, and a workplace that attracts 
new hires.   
 
From my personal experience at CDS, we have always struggled to fill vacant positions. To 
fill the gaps in vacancies, many positions have been asked to do more work or increase 
work expectations to fill the staffing voids.   
 
Many positions at CDS do not  appropriately compensate workers with their pay. This has 
been leaving many vacant positions that do not get filled, directly affecting children and the 
services they can receive. Which then in turn creates heavier caseloads,  occupational stress 
and a high employee burn out/turnover rate.  
 
The children being served by CDS are an  incredibly important but are also very vulnerable. 
All have unique and specialized needs that must be cared for by a variety of providers. 
These services take a caring, passionate an d driven provider. However, employees can not 
pour from any empty cup. With staffing shortages, many of our CDS staff members 
are feeling overworked and  unable to provide the quality of services they wish they could 
or lack the resources to do so, or are b eing asked to work outside of their originally tasked 
job. 
 
A fully funded and staffed CDS means staff  members are being  compensated for their work, 
working hard to retain current staff and to hire new staff to fill the gaps that are 
missing.  Ultimately, c hildren in our state will be better  served and be provided a greater 
amount of services due to an  increase of providers.  
 
Thank you!
