Written Testimony  for LD 258  
February 24 , 2023  
 
Dear Senators Rotundo and Baldacci,  Representatives Sachs and Meyer, and members of the 
Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Health and Human 
Services:  
 
On behalf of the Maine brain injury community – survivors , caregivers and families – we urge 
your support of the DHHS budget request for brain injury and other conditions.  
 
Many more Mainer’s  are now living with  brain injury as a result of  the overdose  crisis . 
Individuals  who survive an  overdose often sustain hypoxic/anoxic brain injury from loss of 
oxygen  to the brain. These i ndividuals are dependent on brain injury core support s and 
services provided by DHHS OADS for help with the chronic  long-term phase of recovery.  
 
These core supports and services are currently in a discretionar y line within the DH HS OADS 
brain injury budget request. We ask that you consider moving  these to their own individual 
line item within the brain injury funding request so that they will continue to be available in 
the future as more individuals surviv e overdose with anoxic/h ypoxic injury to the brain.  
 
Thank you for considering our testimony today. We stand ready to answer any questions that 
you may have about the increasing incidence of brain injury  within Maine’s ongoing  overdose 
crisis.  
 
Respectfully submitted,
