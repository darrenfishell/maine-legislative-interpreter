Dear Members of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs and the Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry Affairs Committees,
My name is Molly DellaRoman and I am providing testimony today in support of the 
biennial budgetâ€™s funding proposals for the Maine Healthy Soils Program and the 
Farmers Drought Relief Program.  Together with my partner, Timothy Skillin, we 
own and operate a MOFGA-certified organic orchard and native plant nursery in 
Brooklin, ME.  As fruit tree growers in Maine, we are on the front lines as far as how 
climate change is negatively impacting agriculture in New England.  Extreme weather
patterns, including drought in the summer and rain instead of snow during the winter, 
has caused great stress to our established orchard trees over the last decade.  The rate 
of our peach tree death this past summer was extreme and will take us years to 
recover from.  We contemplated not planting back peach trees as they have become 
very difficult to grow.  
This month, we found out we were approved for a Maine Soil Health Program grant.  
This grant will provide funds for weed barrier and in combination with an additional 
grant for woodchips through the NRCS's EQIP program, we are planning on building 
back with climate change and drought as a top priority in our peach tree orchard.  
Stone fruits are shallow rooted compared to pomme fruits and therefore are much 
more susceptible to drought.  With the weed fabric to cut down on water competition 
from weeds and the woodchips as both a source of mulch to conserve water and to 
build up soil organic matter, we are now hopeful to keep being able to grow a local, 
organic source of highly nutritious fruit for our community.  
This is just one example of how important this program is.   We are asking for your 
full support in funding these vital programs.
Thank you,
Molly DellaRoman and Timothy Skillin
