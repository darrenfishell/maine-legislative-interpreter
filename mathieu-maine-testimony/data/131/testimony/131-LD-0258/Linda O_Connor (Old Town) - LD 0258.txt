My name is Linda O’Connor and I am writing this testimony on my own time. I work for the State (BMV) 
and I enjoy my job.  I would love to be able have our wages comparable to other jobs around and put us 
up where we belong.    
  
I am a supervisor and some of my employees have left due to not enough income.   They enjoy the work 
and like what they do, but just cannot justify the wages/cost of benefits and with the cost of living 
around here.  They have a lot of information to be res ponsible for and they work face to face with the 
public and customers at times are not very nice to them. They are a hardworking team and so many 
parts to their job.  The turnover rate is very frustrating, and it seems like as soon as I get someone 
trained , they find a job with more pay and leave.    
  
I have a lot of responsibility and a few years ago, (2020) I was diagnosed with cancer.   Being a single 
Mom and trying to run a household on my own, then getting sick and not being able to work was for 
sure a hardship.   I am now still struggling to pay bills, medical bills and have had to sell my home as I 
could not afford to keep it.   I would like for the State to be able to close the pay GAP and keep the good 
people doing the work they do.   It has been a long  time since we have had a pay raise and once you have 
been here so long, you do not see one for years.   The cost of living has gone up so much, yet our wages 
are staying the same.    
  
Thank you.
