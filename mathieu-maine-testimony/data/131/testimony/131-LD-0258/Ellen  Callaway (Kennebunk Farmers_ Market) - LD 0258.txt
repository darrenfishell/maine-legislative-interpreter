Kennebunk Farmers' Market
LD 258
My name is Ellen Callaway, I am a resident of Kennebunk, Maine, and I am here 
today as Kennebunk Farmers' Market Manager to express my support the 
appropriation for the Nutrition Incentive Fund but please make it CONTINUOUS.
Last season, I made many transactions for people in need that rely on the MHB 
program. One woman has 4 kids and a husband that is diagnosed with cancer. Her 
kids are happy & healthy because of the program and her will to provide them with a 
solid childhood. The program is also an integral part of our local economyâ€“providing 
sales for our farmers. 
Without this program, families in need would not be able to buy healthy produce from
our market and our farmers would be penalized with fewer sales.
