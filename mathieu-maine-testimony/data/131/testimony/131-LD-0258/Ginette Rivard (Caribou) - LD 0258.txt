Testimony in support of Retiree COLA  0 2/10/202 3 
Senator Rotundo , Representative Sachs  and members of the Appropriations  and 
Financial Affairs Committee , Senator Tipping  and members of the Labor and 
Housing Committee . My name is Ginette Rivard and I live in Caribou. I retired 7 
years ago, after nearly 25 years in the Children’s Behavioral Health unit at DHHS.  
However, I was on Leave of Absence while serving as full time President of MSEA 
during my last four years of service. I continue to be active with the MSEA Retiree 
program.  
AS you have heard from others, the COLA for MainePERS participants was 
artificially capped at 3% in 2011.  This allowed the administration of that time to 
balance the budget , in order to incr ease spending in other areas.  To put it 
bluntly, that budget was balanced on the backs of the very people who kept the 
state running and  have  continue d to do so.   
As you know a COLA, or Cost -of-Living Adjustment , is defined as “ an increase 
made to count eract the effects of rising prices in the economy ”.  Granted, since 
2011, the COLA has been below the 3%  cap a number of times .  However, the 
COLA  has been in excess of 3% a t least  twice we have had to come before this 
committee, hat in hand, begging for a n Ad Hoc COLA.  And we appreciate your 
willingness to hear us.  
We ask that you raise the cap for future years so that current and future retirees 
have the assurance that the retirement benefits we all worked hard to secure will 
keep up with inflation.  Thi s action will help address the inequity that was created 
by the 2011 cuts to current and future retirees .  As always, I thank you for your 
time and consideration.
