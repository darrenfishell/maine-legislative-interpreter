Good afternoon, Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs; Senator Lawrence and 
Representative Ziegler and members of the Joint Select Committee on Energy, Utilities 
and Technology. My name is Nick Battista, and I am the Chief Policy Ofﬁcer of the 
Island Institute and Chair of the ConnectMaine Authority. I am here today to testify in 
support of LD258, the Biennial Budget. 
This budget advances the Governor ’s guiding belief that to build a stronger, more 
prosperous state where opportunity is available to all, then We must invest in the 
infrastructure that supports the people of Maine, our greatest asset. 
For the ConnectMaine Authority, the biennial budget presented to you today, does 
not request any additional funding or contain any new initiatives though, importantly, it 
will allow for the continued administration of a $28M competitive grant awarded in 2021 
by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration that is bringing 
broadband to 15,000 Maine homes in very rural, unserved, parts of our state.

CONNECTMAINE AUTHORITY 
The ConnectMaine Authority is a public instrumentality of Maine state 
government, whose mission is to facilitate the universal availability of broadband to all 
Maine households and businesses and help them understand the valuable role it can play 
in enriching their lives and helping their communities thrive. Duties of the Authority 
include establishing criteria defining unserved and under-served areas; collecting and 
disseminating information regarding the availability of broadband; promoting and 
supporting broadband investment; and facilitating state support of deployment of 
broadband infrastructure. The Authority consists of seven voting members. 
On July 15, 2022, the ConnectMaine Authority signed a service contract with 
Maine Connectivity Authority (MCA) to undertake these duties in a way that maximized 
Maine's ability to leverage additional Federal broadband funding while streamlining 
operations and improving coordination with local governments, internet service 
providers, and others involved in broadband network planning or construction. This 
combined effort enables the acceleration of planning and funding of projects serving 
underserved and unserved areas of the State and ensures ongoing alignment of policies 
critical to achieving universal access. This "single door" solution simplifies access to 
Maine citizens, broadband stakeholders, and the federal government to State of Maine 
broadband authority and eliminates public confusion about the roles and responsibilities 
of the various broadband entities.
