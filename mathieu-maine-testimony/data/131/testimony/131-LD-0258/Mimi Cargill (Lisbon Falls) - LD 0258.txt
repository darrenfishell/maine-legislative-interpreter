Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and 
honorable members of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and 
Financial Affairs and Labor and Housing: my name is Mimi Cargill and I live in 
Lisbon Falls.
As an end of life care giver, I see how hard it is for families to cope with the stress of 
having a loved one in a precarious situation; having to work, and deal with the 
emotional part of it. On top of that, the family might have to pay any caregiver that's 
helping out, in many cases pooling their money to afford this expense. They have to 
pay me $15 per hour, sometimes for 24 hrs straight or up to 40 hours per week. 
These people need help now. This is why it is very important that the appropriation 
committee fund start-up costs for Paid Family and Medical Leave. Please, please, do 
not wait two to three years to allocate the money for this most important need. In my 
opinion paid leave is cheaper than the cost of a nursing care facility, and will allow a 
loved one to care for and spend quality time with a family member. Thank you.
