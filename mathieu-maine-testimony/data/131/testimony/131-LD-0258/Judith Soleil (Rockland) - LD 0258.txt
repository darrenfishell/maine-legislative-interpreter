 Maine Healthy Soils Program creates a hub for critical information, tools, and 
assistance to help more Maine farms use practices to build soil health and benefit 
from the climate change resilience and mitigation as well as the economic benefits 
that healthy soils can provide. I support robust implementation of the program.
