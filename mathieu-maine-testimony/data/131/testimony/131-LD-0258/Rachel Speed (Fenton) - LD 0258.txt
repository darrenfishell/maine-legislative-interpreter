Rachel Speed
Fenton
LD 258
My name is Rachel Speed and I worked 31 years as a school social worker in Maine. I
retired with a pension in 2014 and moved back to Missouri to help my ailing parents. 
I was 58 yrs old and lost 20% of my pension because I was not at my normal 
retirement age of 62.
At the time I retired I was making a little over $60,000. My current monthly pension 
is $1957 a month. I do qualify to take my Social Security but I am waiting a little 
longer so that my monthly benefit will increase. I have some investments and if not 
for that I would be greatly struggling financially. I am single and I have no other 
source of income
I am writing you this email to strongly urge your  support of LD 111, LD 112 and LD 
70. Teachers and support staff should have the respect and financial compensation 
they deserve. They are in charge of our greatest resource, our children. Passing these 
bills would help pension beneficiaries keep pace with inflation. Please demonstrate 
you care about children and believe that the teachers and support staff that help 
educate them merit the critical benefits these bills would bring.
Thank you for your time in this important matter.
                                            Sincerely,
                                             Rachel Speed
                                             Fenton, Mo.
