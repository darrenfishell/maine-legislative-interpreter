RE: LD 258
I am in favor of this bill so that no other family has to endure what we have been 
through, trying to find our missing disabled son for nearly 9 months. I am submitting 
an account of what we’ve experienced, hoping it will inspire you to make changes in 
the system. And I know that change will not come unless behavioral health is properly
funded, so please approve LD 258.
Here is my account:
WONDERING WHY WE HAVEN’T FOUND MY DISABLED ADULT SON, 
GRAHAM LACHER, EIGHT MONTHS AFTER HE DISAPPEARED? 
It might surprise you to know that, in effect, there is:
NO OFFICIAL ONGOING SEARCH FOR MY SON
NO TRUE SYSTEMWIDE ALERT SENT OUT
NO CONSISTENT PROTOCOL FOR FOLLOWING UP ON POSSIBLE LEADS
Let’s take them one at a time:
1) NO OFFICIAL SEARCH. If you follow this page, you know there was a brief, 
inadequate search by Bangor Maine Police Department (BPD) the day he went 
missing in June. We know it was inadequate because Graham was actually in the 
woods they briefly searched—he was shown on security footage there, and his hat 
was found there (we know it was his hat because it had his name written on the tag). 
Five days after he disappeared, there were planes, drones and dogs out looking for 
him, but we know now those efforts were more geared toward finding a body than a 
living person. 
2) NO ONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS OFFICIALLY LOOKING FOR 
GRAHAM NOW. In fact, many in law enforcement aren’t aware that he’s a missing 
person—a vulnerable adult, without ID or money, whose impaired judgment puts his 
life at risk. We know that many aren’t aware because we’ve been told that, face to 
face, as we travel the state in search of him ourselves.
2) NO SYSTEMWIDE ALERT. Not only did we have to fight to get a Silver Alert 
issued for my son (it was delayed by hours—busy, early evening hours, when the 
public might have seen him), but we’ve learned that a Silver Alert isn’t what most of 
us think it is. 
 According to the state’s website, a Silver Alert is issued by a local police department, which 
“will also contact the Maine Department of Public Safety’s Communications center to assist in
getting the information out to the news media, the Maine Lottery Commission and the Maine 
Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike Authority.” 
 SILVER ALERTS ARE NOT SENT TO ALL MAINE POLICE DEPARTMENTS OR TO THE 
WARDEN SERVICE. So it is no surprise that many of the law officers we’ve encountered 
throughout the state have not been aware of Graham’s disappearance.
 But police are not alone in this. SILVER ALERTS ARE ALSO NOT SENT TO 
AMBULANCES, HOSPITALS, HOMELESS SHELTERS, WARMING CENTERS, SOUP 
KITCHENS OR ANY OF THE AGENCIES THAT HELP THE HOMELESS. If Graham is still 
alive, these are the services he is most likely to access. 
 SILVER ALERTS ARE ALSO NOT SENT TO SEARCH AND RESCUE GROUPS, most of 
which do not get involved in a search unless they are invited by local law enforcement. In our 
case, BPD assigned an officer to Graham’s case who didn’t know a Silver Alert should be 
issued, who didn’t invite the Warden Service despite the fact that Graham entered the woods,
and who didn’t invite any other search groups to join the effort. (We are lucky that the 
volunteer search group DEEMI does not wait to be invited, has conducted searches in 
response to possible sightings, and will do so again if Graham is spotted in the Penobscot 
County area.)
3) NO CONSISTENT PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. This part is especially heartbreaking. Even if 
someone sees Graham, recognizes him, and tries to get him help, we are not likely to know 
anything about it unless they contact us directly and we go out ourselves to try to find and 
help him.
                                                    
Despite official pleas for help from the public, THERE IS ALMOST NO CHANCE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT WILL FOLLOW UP IN A TIMELY MANNER  WHEN A POSSIBLE 
SIGHTING IS CALLED IN. There are many reasons for this. 
 What the public is told to do is contradictory. The Silver Alert posted on the Dept. of Public 
Safety’s website (and sent to media outlets) tells the public to contact BPD if they have 
information about Graham’s whereabouts. BPD’s press releases tell the public to contact their
own local law enforcement agencies. We ourselves have been sent in jurisdictional circles 
when we’ve tried to get help following up on a lead. And we’ve been told by numerous 
members of the public that, they, too, have been sent in circles when trying to report a 
sighting.
 Calling 911 won’t necessarily result in action. 911 calls go to local dispatch centers. Some 
serve police departments that are so big they don’t place much emphasis on finding an adult 
male who is a missing person. And if they haven’t been sent or don’t understand that the 
Silver Alert means Graham is a vulnerable adult whose life is in danger, it’s not a surprise that
they don’t act. Other departments may be so small they don’t have the resources to respond 
at all; we’ve been told more than once that they would do their best, but couldn’t guarantee 
they’d be able to follow up.
 It is rare, nearly miraculous, when all the elements are present—when police receive a tip in 
a timely manner; know that Graham is a missing, vulnerable adult/subject of a Silver Alert; 
have the manpower to follow up immediately; encounter the person believed to be Graham; 
and make a positive ID either to confirm or eliminate the sighting. When that happens, we’ve 
found caring, compassionate law officers who do their best to help; what we need is a system
that routinely—rather than rarely—helps them do that.
                                                     
Despite the fact that I am Graham’s full, legal guardian (in other words: because he makes 
decisions that can endanger his life, my authority supersedes his own), I AM NOT AT ALL 
LIKELY TO KNOW IF AN AGENCY OR SERVICE HAS INTERACTED WITH HIM.
 There is widespread misunderstanding, misinterpretation and misapplication of privacy 
rules. As Graham’s full legal guardian, no person or agency is allowed to withhold information
from me about his medical condition, whereabouts, or well-being. Yet I am repeatedly told 
they can’t tell me anything because of privacy rules. 
 We have encountered police who’ve told us they really can’t do or say anything unless I can 
show them a “blue-paper.” (A “blue paper” is an involuntary hospital commitment order issued
by a judge after a health evaluation has been made of a patient and concludes they need 
treatment. It cannot be issued unless the patient is present; in other words, I can’t have one in
my possession because Graham is missing!).
 A disoriented man crying out for help was recently transported by ambulance to a hospital in
a city with two hospitals. I called both and was told by both that no one fitting that description 
had been admitted. I followed up with local dispatch and found that the person was, indeed, 
admitted but was not Graham. So one of the hospitals lied to me, probably due to a 
misapplication of HIPAA laws designed to protect patient privacy. But here’s the thing: I did 
not ask them to reveal the identity of the man admitted unless he was my son. If the patient 
had been my son, they would be violating my rights as his guardian by not telling me (not to 
mention Graham's right to a court-appointed advocate to work on his behalf).
I despair of ever getting this system to work for someone like my son!
                                                  
BOTTOM LINE: THERE IS NO OFFICIAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT TO DO OR WHEN 
TO DO IT WHEN SOMEONE LIKE MY SON GOES MISSING. AND HIS LIFE COULD WELL 
BE LOST BECAUSE OF THAT.
