Hearing Date: February 21, 2023 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services; my name is Benjamin Mann and I am the 
Deputy Commissioner of Finance at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). I 
am here today to speak in support of LD 258, the Governor ’s Biennial Budget proposal for State 
ﬁscal years 2024 and 2025. 
Overall Budget 
This budget advances the Govemor’s guiding belief that to build a stronger, more prosperous state 
where opportunity is available to all, then we must invest in the infrastructure that supports the 
people of Maine, our greatest asset. 
That is Why this budget proposal strengthens the very things that Maine people rely on every day 
to succeed. It builds on the strong success of the currently enacted budget and the work done in 
last legislative session to tackle Maine’s greatest challenges. 
We have governed cautiously and in a fiscally prudent way over the past four years, making sure 
that — even in the hardest of times during the pandemic - we lived within our means. This budget 
proposal continues that practice. 
Highlights from Department of Health and Human Services 
Governor Mills’ budget proposal for the DHHS FY24-25 biennial budget continues policy 
efforts that were initiated at the beginning of her Administration, such as expanding access to 
health care and child care, as well as rebuilding critical parts of State government, such as the 
Maine CDC. This budget makes historic investments in behavioral health, increases supports for 
older Mainers, and supports a transformation of services for adults with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities (IDD). The budget also provides funding for cost-of~living 
2/21/2023 Department of Health and Human Services — Biennial Budget Page 1 of32
adjustments in_numerous MaineCare and related provider payment rates in the wake of high 
inﬂation, consistent with Public Law 2021, chapter 398, Part AAAA as Well as MaineCare rate 
reform as codiﬁed in Public Law 2021, chapter 639. 
Before going through speciﬁc initiatives, I would like to brieﬂy describe the major investments 
in the Department ’s budget proposal. For the Department ’s budget as a Whole, the Governor is 
proposing funding of $638 million ($316 million General Fund) for ﬁscal years 2024 and 2025. 
This would be partially offset by $59 million in one-time deappropriations and lapse of prior 
year canying balances to ensure that we are being ﬁscally prudent and living within our means. 
The biennial budget proposes to invest $237 million ($94 million GF) in behavioral health 
services over the coming biennium. The primary initiative behind this historic investment isa 
$166 million ($63 million GF) increase in MaineCare and related behavioral health rates. The 
new rates support mental health and substance use disorder services and targeted case 
management. Many of these rates have not been updated for years. These changes help 
MaineCare members access and coordinate mental health, medical and social services in their 
communities. Also included in the $237 million investment is $17 million ($10 million GF) to 
bolster children ’s behavioral health services in light of a pressing need to ﬁll gaps in the 
continuum of services. 
This budget proposes to provide $144 million ($72 million GF) to expand and improve home 
based care, the safety of older Mainers, and continues to invest in long term care facilities, 
including nursing homes. Included in this $144 million is $4 million to implement several 
recommendations from the Elder Justice Roadmap, $48 million ($30 million GF) to make 
community living sustainable for older adults such as supporting home-delivered meals and 
sustaining the expansion of home-based care (Section 63) enacted in last year’s budget, and $91 
million ($37 million GF) for Maine’s nursing homes and residential care facilities (PNMI Cs) 
and to support reform in how MaineCare pays for long-term care. 
The biennial budget proposes $84 million ($27 million GF) to support access to services for 
individuals with [DD and brain injury, including $34 million ($11 million GF) to ensure there is 
no wait for Section 29 services at the start of 2025 by requesting support for an additional 900 
people, and $3 million ($1 million GF) to fully fund enrolling people served on an emergency 
basis under Section 21. The budget proposes $5 million ($2 million GF) to transform service 
delivery by creating a new Lifespan Waiver, which will address multiple levels of need overan 
individual ‘s lifetime within a single program. As the Governor said in her budget address, this 
initiative ﬂips the system to focus on the services individuals need, not on the bureaucracy that 
provides those services. This will help give individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers, the 
peace of mind of a system of adjustable, adaptable, and individualized support. 
The majority of the cost of the Department ’s budget is for policies that are already in current law. 
The budget provides funding for cost-of-living adjustments in numerous MaineCare and related 
provider payment rates in the wake of high inﬂation, consistent with MaineCare rate reform as 
codiﬁed in P.L. 2021 ch. 639. This includes planned rate reform for hospitals and nursing 
facilities. It proposes ongoing funding for rates that support 125 percent of minimum wage for 
2/21/2023 Department of Health and Human Services — Biennial Budget Page0 
2 of32
direct care workers. And it ﬁilly funds initiatives that Were partly funded in the previous budget 
such as the rate rebasing for Federally Qualiﬁed Health Centers. 
Similarly, the Department ’s budget proposal continues investment in child care and child 
welfare. Speciﬁcally, the budget requests nearly $8 million to fully fund the child care salary 
supplements enacted in the FY2022 supplemental budget to so that child care workers will 
continue to receive increased pay for the critical services they provide. Building on the 
substantial funding provided in prior budgets, this biennial budget requests nearly $12 million for 
foster care and adoption assistance and also provides $2 million for foster care reimbursement 
rate increases. 
As in the supplemental budget, the biennial budget proposes one-time funding for both the state 
($8 million) and municipalities ($3 million) to support increased General Assistance costs which 
have risen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic and policy changes. This funding would 
serve as a bridge while the Department works With the Legislature, municipalities, and 
stakeholders toward sustainable policy changes to support the pro gram’s goal of serving people 
in need effectively in the long run. 
Lastly, the Department proposes ntunerous initiatives to support its ongoing operations. This 
includes, for example, $3 million to support renovation and maintenance activities at Dorothea 
Dix Psychiatric Center and Riverview Psychiatric Center. The proposals include $2 million in 
general funds for Maine CDC positions such as those needed to conduct testing for PFAS, 
improve state lab response, and expand drinking Water inﬁastructure projects. 
I will not be talking about all of the above priorities today, but they will all be covered over the 
course of the scheduled DHHS budget hearings. 
A housekeeping note before I begin: for many of the initiatives that we’ll cover, I included the 
traditional budget language that directly aligns to what you see in the Governor ’s printed budget. 
This language is italicized. However, my oral testimony today will summarize each initiative so 
that it’s easier to understand while not losing any detail or meaning. Thus, my testimony today is 
32 pages but I won’t be reading it all. I think this approach will help with an understanding of 
initiatives, but please let me know if you have any questions.
