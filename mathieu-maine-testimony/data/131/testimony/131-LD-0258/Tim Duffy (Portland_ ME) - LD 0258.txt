Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative 
Salisbury, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committees on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Criminal Justice and Public Safety: my 
name is Tim Duffy and I live in Portland. I come before you today as someone whose 
family, like so many others, has been affected by the carceral system’s use as the 
main treatment for substance use issues. I have a half-brother and two uncles who are 
no longer with us, all of whom spent time in prison as a result of substances. I am not 
blaming this system directly for them not being here but I do regularly wonder what 
could have been if we had a system that focuses on care and rehabilitation instead of 
punishment. 
Time after time we put vast amounts of money into systems that take away freedom 
from people and turn them into numbers, while giving the bare minimum to 
non-punitive recovery systems. We take people who have made mistakes and remove 
them from their communities and families and place them in facilities where they are 
often isolated or in dangerous situations. The majority of these people will eventually 
be returned to their communities and families but are they returning better than before
they went in? Are they even the same? The answer is different for all but in my 
experience, I know they weren’t the same.
I ask today that you please consider taking the step to properly funding treatment 
options that heal instead of punish. The DOC and police continually have massive 
budgets and the problems communities face are only increasing. It is time to take a 
stand and look towards compassionate, evidence-based care so that we can begin to 
rebuild our communities.
Thank you for your time.
