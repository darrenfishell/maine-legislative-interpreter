Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, members of the Committee on Appropriations and
Financial Affairs, and Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Health and
Human Services, my name is Jordyn Rossignol and I own and operate Miss Jordyn’s Child
Development Center in Caribou.
Over the last few years I’ve been very vocal about how severely fractured our entire child care
sector is. I could sit here for hours and tell you about all the cracks in the foundation of this
critical service to our community. But to really understand how imperative it is to act now, I
encourage you to spend time at your local child care center or family child care provider’s home.
I urge you to spend an hour watching how we are working with limited resources yet held to the
highest standards of care by those who license us.
We cannot continue to do this work without qualified staff who are here because they love this
career. We cannot continue to do this work while worrying how we are going to make our rent
this month or cover food costs. We cannot continue to do this work without funding. We cannot
continue to allow parents to stay employed and keep our economy afloat if we aren’t heard once
and for all.
Childcare WILL be obsolete if we don’t invest NOW. The relief money has kept us afloat but
these are bandaids to an otherwise oozing wound. It is time that we completely rework how the
business model of the entire child sector is built so that we once and for all, will officially operate
like the PROFESSION we are.
