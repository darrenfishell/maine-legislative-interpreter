LD 258 “An Act Making Unified Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund and 
Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain Provisions of the 
Law Necessary to the Proper Operations of State Government for the Fiscal Years Ending June 
30, 2023, June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025 -”
Representative Sachs, Senator Rotundo and members of the Committee on Appropriations and 
Financial Affairs.
My name is Dennis LaJoie, I have been the Town Manager of Norway, Maine for the last 5 
years. I’m speaking today in support of LD 258, specifically the provision for funding Maine’s 
Community Resilience Partnership. Our town, with the support of The Center for an Ecology-
Based Economy, a local non-profit and Service Provider for the program, has received funding 
from the program to conduct a climate resilience assessment of all the critical infrastructure in 
the municipality, as well as assessment and planning work to support vulnerable populations in 
our community. Additionally, we are creating a standing Climate Action Advisory Committee to 
create a climate action plan for the town which will be referenced in our forthcoming 
Comprehensive Plan. This group will also guide future engagement with the Community 
Resilience Partnership and already identified a solar project on our town office building that will 
save the town thousands of dollars annually in electricity costs while being a public 
demonstration of the critical transition to renewable energy as Maine works to meet its 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. 
Continued funding for this program will be critical to small communities like ours to lead the 
transition to clean energy and to build resilience to the accelerating effects of climate change. 
We look forward to working with the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future as 
part of this important and innovative program. 
Thank you for you consideration of this critical funding.
