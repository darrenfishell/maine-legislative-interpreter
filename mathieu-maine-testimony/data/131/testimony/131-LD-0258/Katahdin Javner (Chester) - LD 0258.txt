Dear Reader,
My name is Katahdin Javner, I am a first year Business Management student at Eastern Maine
Community College (EMCC) Bangor campus. I was fortunate enough to qualify for the 2-years of free
college that is covering my tuition costs.
This financial assistance has impacted my educational journey in several ways. It brought down the
barrier of paying for my full education during a time when I was faced with many changes, like many other
students the time of the pandemic changed a lot of students plans and even our confidence to continue
our education. After high school I started my own Limited Liability Company (LLC) because of a need I
wanted to fill in my hometown community, however I knew that I would have to continue my education in
order to best serve my community with running my business the best way I can. The free tuition sealed
the deal for attending EMCC to gain the knowledge and experience to better run my business in order to
help my community.
The benefits from the free college tuition has no limits. I know it has motivated students that would have
not continued their education to go on and accomplish more than they could ever imagine because that
was me. The greatest investment for a community is an investment into the education of the people, the
benefits will most certainly outweigh the costs. I highly recommend the continuing of this funding. If it does
not continue Maine residents will suffer a much lower standard of living when the ever decreasing number
of workers continues to go down. I do not want our future generations to have to pay over $100/h for any
trades to complete basic home maintenance. We need trained workers in our state!
Sincerely,
Katahdin Javner
