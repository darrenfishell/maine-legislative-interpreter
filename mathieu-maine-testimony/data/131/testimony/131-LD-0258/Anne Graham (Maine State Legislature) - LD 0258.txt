Testimony of Rep. Anne Graham in support of 
LD 258, An Act Making Uniﬁed Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund 
and Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain 
Provisions of the Law Necessary to the Proper Operations of State Government for the 
Fiscal Years Ending June 30, 2023, June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, PartI 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and my esteemed colleagues of the Appropriations and 
Financial Affairs Committee, my name is Anne Graham and I represent the communities of Gray 
and North Yarmouth, House District 105. I am here to testify in support of clarifying language 
on LD 1: 5721-A. Limitation on municipal property tax levy. This is in reference to Part “I” 
which updates statutes relevant to the General Fund appropriations limit. Repeal of the law can 
be considered at the discretion of this honorable committee. 
POSTED ON: MAY 31, 2022 - 9:09AM Town of Gray website 
LD1 is a state law that attempts to limit the growth of T own budgets by requiring a vote if the 
property tax levy limit, which is determined by the LD] formula, is exceeded. Because of this 
formula, voters will need to approve the new Town budget ﬁgure in Article 3 as well as an 
override (increase) of the LD1 limit in Article J 0 for the Town budget to pass. Article 10 on the 
ballot asks voters to increase this limit from $4, 645,213 to $5,655,301. 
In the past two ﬁscal years, the State has gone ﬁrom giving towns three percent in revenue 
sharing to ﬁve percent, and this has a direct impact on the LD] formula (see the next question). 
The increased State revenue changed Gray's LD1 formulation enough to warrant an override. 
As one of the town of Gray’s two state representatives, I understand that this law has caused 
confusion among voters and created an undue burden for the work of Gray’s town government 
and other connnunities around the state. I also represent North Yarmouth where we enjoy the 
town meeting format where confusion can sometimes reign. The LD 1 override law language 
sows even more confusion. As a fonner select board member, I can say that we were usually able 
District 105: North Yarmouth and Gray
to explain LD 1 with the 50 to 100 residents who showed up on a Spring Saturday morning. Gray 
doesn't have that option. 
In my humble opinion, it comes down to keeping things simple. It is important that our 
community members understand what they are voting on. I look to DAFS and AF A to craft this 
language that will do that on LD 1 override language. 
Thank you for your time and I look forward to our work together in the 131st session and beyond.
