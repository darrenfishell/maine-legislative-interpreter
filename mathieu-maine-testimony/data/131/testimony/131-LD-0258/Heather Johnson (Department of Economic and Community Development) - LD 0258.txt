HOUSING OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM 
The Housing Opportunity Program was established in DECD in 2022 through 
Public Law 2021, chapter 672 which provided program guidance and chapter 635 which 
provided funding for two limited period positions as well as operating funds and grant 
funds to meet program requirements. The grant funds became part of the baseline 
budget.' 
Public Law 2021, chapter 672 required the Housing Opportunity Program to go 
through rulemaking to create the grant fund and to clarify the zoning regulations. The 
rules were officially released yesterday. Once the rulemaking process is complete, we 
will begin the grant programming to ﬁnancially support service providers and 
municipalities with zoning ordinance implementation, to suppoit increased housing 
development. We anticipate that to start in the May 2023 timeframe. 
In addition, we are working collaboratively With the Maine State Housing 
Authority to establish statewide housing inventory report and to develop production 
goals based in part on that data. 
The request for the Housing Opportunity Program may be found on page A-201. 
The General Fund baseline request of $2,656,126 in FY24 and FY25 in All Other 
represents funding to administer two competitive grant programs. The ﬁrst competitive 
grant totals $1,000,000 and provides ﬁlnding to regional service providers to support 
town housing ordinance development, planning board and public processes in each 
participating municipality; the second grant totals $1,450,000 and provides funding for 
community housing implementation grants to individual towns to support community 
housing priorities, the remaining all other of $206,126 is for program administration. 
Personal Services costs of $254,8 1 0 covers the costs of two limited period staff members 
in FY24. Pursuant to statute, a report will be provided by January 15, 2024, to the Joint
