Good Evening  Members  of the Maine Committee on Appropriations  and Financial 
Affairs:  
 
Social workers are committed to their careers, helping all individuals in communities 
throughout the State of Maine. Now more than ever is the time for Appropriations Committee 
Members of Maine to look                       toward the mental health future of our state and make a 
solid statement about their commitment to change by funding the Social Wor k Loan Repayment 
Program -LD 632.  
The State of Maine's economy suffers when mental or behavioral health needs go unmet, 
so providing an answer to one of the root causes can provide a significant impact on hundreds of 
social workers currently                 struggling to pay their student loans while serving Maineâ€™s 
children, families, older adults, those with substance use disorders, or struggling with health and 
mental health concerns.  
Social workers can be found in a variety of settings working within home s, schools, 
hospitals, prisons, government, social service agencies, mental health facilities, nonprofit 
organizations, and so many more.                     Student loan debt and the lack of competitive pay 
for social workers in Maine have forced many qual ified would -be therapists to avert the field or 
move out of state. The behavioral health care crisis cannot be                     addressed if it lacks the 
professionals needed to do the work. These behavioral healthcare workers are so vital to the 
overall  well-being of our society  
Please vote in favor of and pass the Social Work Loan Repayment Program -LD 632. This 
bill is a path that will provide a sustainable financial future not only for those who live in Maine 
and are in need of mental               health support but for the empathetic problem -solvers that are 
committed to providing support for the holistic health of All Mainers. While funding society's 
equitable programs is important, financially supporting               those who do the work is vital.  
 
Sincerely,  
Lori Pelkey  MSW,LPN
