The Maine Connectivity Authority (MCA) was established in 2021 and operationalized in 2022 
as a quasi-govemmental agency charged with achieving universal access of affordable high-speed 
broadband in Maine. Led by an experienced staff and eleven member board appointed by the Governor 
and conﬁrmed by the Senate, the MCA works collaboratively with the ConnectMaine Authority to 
ensure effective, accessible connectivity be universally available in the state; that there be secure, 
affordable, reliable, competitive, sustainable and forward-looking infrastructure that can meet future 
needs; and that all residents, businesses and institutions in Maine be able to take full advantage of the 
economic, health, educational and other opportunities available through connectivity services. MCA 
was intentionally designed to ensure seamless alignment with the State’s existing broadband ofﬁce 
ConnectMaine, which is housed within the Department of Economic and Community Development. 
That intent has been codiﬁed with an agreement to share staff and streamline operations between the 
agencies effectively creating a “single-door solution ” for all stakeholders.

0 $150M through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) which includes the State’s allocation 
of $21M through the Maine Jobs & Recovery Program (MJRP) and $129M through the Capital 
Projects Funds. 
0 An anticipated $250M through lnﬁastructure, Investment and Jobs Act (The Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law). We are currently conducting a planning process required to access those 
funds.
