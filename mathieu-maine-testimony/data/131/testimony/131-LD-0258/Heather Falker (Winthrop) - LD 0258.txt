To whom it may concern,  
Thank you for your time and attention. My name is Heather Falker . I have worked for DHHS for 
approximately 6 years. I am writing  on my own personal time  in support of the biennial b udget LD 258.   
My greatest concerns related to the budget include closing the pay gap , fixing the classification system  
and continuing Covid aid . This would not only i mpact myself  personally , but also m y husband. He has 
worked for the Department of Corrections for nearly 20 years.  
The budget increase would aid in our ability to live . In one year we have seen increases in child care 
THREE times . On top  of the c ontinu ed price increase for energy and food. This has dramatically affected 
our household budget. However, I have only received one wage step increase.  Which was also my last 
step . 
Previously, we had additional time off to care for our family of five during covid  infections. As of 2023 
we d o not.  Unfortunately, covid impacts my child care center availability, d ue to staff shortages . 
Consequently, forcing myself and or husband to take time off of work , even if by  some  chance none of 
my family is ill. I was pregnant at the time covid became ou r reality. Therefore, my children are too 
young to wear a mask safely or effectively.  
Please consider my story, that is like so many other Mainer families that  also serve The State of Maine  
for the people of Maine.  
Thank you for your contributions,  
Heathe r Falker
