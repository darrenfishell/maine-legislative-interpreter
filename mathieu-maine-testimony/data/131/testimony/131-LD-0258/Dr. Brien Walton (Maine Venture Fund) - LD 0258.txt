During my past two years as Chairman of the Maine Venture Fund, I have witnessed 
a seamless transition of governance from John Burns, our founding Managing 
Director, to Joe Powers and Nina Scheepers, who are supported by Terri Wark, in 
managing all aspects of the Fund’s operations.  During the past two years, the Maine 
Venture Fund has deployed more capital investment into Maine companies than in 
prior years, and launched more new initiatives to both broaden and deepen the Fund’s 
impact on the Maine entrepreneurial ecosystem, and I am honored to have the 
privilege of working alongside Joe and his team.
