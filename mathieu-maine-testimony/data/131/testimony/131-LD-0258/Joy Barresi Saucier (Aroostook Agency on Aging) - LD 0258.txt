Good morning, Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and members of the Appropriations & Financial 
Affairs Committee, and Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee. 
My name is Joy Barresi Saucier. of Mars Hill, Maine, offering testimony in support of LD 258 in my role as 
Executive Director of the Aroostook Agency on Aging and President of the Maine Association of Agencies 
on Aging. 
As we age, we want to make our own decisions and live independently. We know that when we age in 
our home community, we contribute our knowledge and talent to make our community stronger. There 
are five Agencies on Aging in Maine; all focused on helping older adults continue to live independently in 
their home communities. 
Nearly 29% of Maine's total population is age 60 and over. We know that 1 of every 4 older adults live 
alone in Maine and that 1 of every 6 are threatened by hunger._ 
All Agencies on Aging offer five categories of core service, two of which are impacted by LD 258: 
Supportive Services including Aging and Disability Resource Centers and Nutrition Services including 
Home Delivered Meals. 
Aging and Disability Resource Centers 
All people have questions or need assistance from time to time. Agencies on Aging in Maine act as 
Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) providing confidential, unbiased ’ telephone and in-person 
information and support to older people, those with disabilities and their family caregivers. These 
agencies often act as the first and only responder to those with questions or challenges that impact their 
ability to live independently. 
In FY2022, Maine's Agencies on Aging provided responses to over 291,000 requests for Information and 
Assistance. Not only is the current community need immense, but requests from consumers areyI

(Continued) Testimony of Maine Association of Agencies on Aging and Aroostook Agency on Aging 
in Support of Home Delivered Meals and Aging and Disability Resource Centers a part of LD 258 (HP 163) 
Home Delivered Meals 
All Agencies on Aging address nutritional needs through a variety of programs, including Home- 
Delivered Meals, Congregate Dining, and Nutrition Counseling and Education. Home Delivered Meals, 
more commonly known as Meals on Wheels, provides daily fresh meals or weekly frozen meals to older 
adults who are homebound and have difficulty with meal preparation. All participants receive an 
assessment of their nutritional status and referrals are made as appropriate to other programs and 
services to help ensure good nutrition and independence. Meals are delivered regularly to participants 
by volunteers who not only take the time to conduct safety checks, but also to provide a caring 
connection to the community. 
A Brown University study in 2015 found that older adults living alone who received meals had significant 
reductions in feelings of isolation and loneliness, were less worried about staying in their homes, felt 
safer, and experienced fewer falls and hospitalizations. There have been many examples throughout 
the state of situations where Home Delivered Meals staff and volunteers have saved the lives of those 
served. 
Through the pandemic, all regions of Maine saw significant growth in demand for Home-Delivered 
Meals. In the fiscal year prior to COVlD, statewide over 5,200 older adults were provided with over 
661,000 meals. During COVID, that number basically doubled to over 10,000 older adults receiving 
1,156,033 meals annually with approximately 2/3 of new consumers qualifying by pre-pandemic 
eligibility standards. In the last fiscal year, Agencies on Aging continued to see strong need for the 
program with 1,022,352 meals provided; a 45% increase over pre-pandemic levels. 
Contributions from the community make the program highly cost efficient. Last year, 700 volunteers 
throughout Maine contributed 63,886 hours of service to the program. Valued at $1.7 million, this 
volunteer time exceeded the total amount contributed to the program through either state funding 
($564,043) or regular Older Americans Act Title lll funding ($1.43M). In addition, the Agencies on Aging 
receive over $1.5 million annually to support this vital program from corporate, individual, foundation, 
and municipal donations. 
Total expenditures state-wide for Home Delivered Meals in 2021-2022 exceeded $8.6 million, witha 
portion of those costs covered through ARPA funding, which is expected to be depleted by the fall of 
2023. 
This leaves many older adults in the State at risk for losing this life sustaining program. LD 258 is one 
step we can take to prevent this from happening as it provides an additional $2.29M in state funding 
annually to ensure home-delivered meals continue to be available for homebound older adults. 
We appreciate your support as we all work together to continue to meet the needs of older adults living 
independently in the great State of Maine.
