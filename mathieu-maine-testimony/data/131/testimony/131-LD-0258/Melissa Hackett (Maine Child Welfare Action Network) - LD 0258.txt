To the Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
May 17, 2023 
 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and esteemed members of the Appropriations and Financial 
Affairs Committee. I am Melissa Hackett, submitting testimony on behalf of the Maine Child Welfare 
Action Network. We are a group of organizations and individuals working to ensure the safety and well-
being of all Maine children, youth, and families. 
Specifically, the Network would like to lift up for your consideration two items in the Health and Human 
Services portion of the change package, related to initiatives outlined in the newly released state Child 
Safety and Family Well-being Plan,i which focuses on efforts to keep children safe by keeping families 
strong. The Network has been proud to work alongside partners in DHHS and OCFS, in collaboration with 
other state and community partners, as well as families, to inform the development of this plan that 
outlines how we can work together to support the health and well-being of Maine families.  
The two initiatives in the Purchased Social Services program include $750,000 in one-time funding to 
develop and implement a resource hub and communications campaign to reduce stigma for parents in 
accessing supports and services and to elevate the universal message that parenting is hard and seeking 
help is a strength; and $335,000 in one-time funding for the development and implementation of 
coordinated community-based strategies to support and strengthen families.  
Additionally, the Network supports the proposed: 
• $7 million to bolster direct response to the opioid crisis and funding to support substance use 
prevention, treatment, and recovery; 
• $8 million to catalyze improvements to children’s behavioral health care;  
• $12 million for foster care and adoption assistance;  
• $2.3 million to expand the Maine Apprenticeship Program;  
• $4 million to double the state’s refundable child care tax credit;  
• $15 million to expand eligibility for the Low-Income Assistance Program; and 
• $5.9 million to expand High-fidelity Wraparound Services. 
Furthermore, our Network strongly encourages the committee to review and support the strategic 
legislative and budget initiatives outlined in the Child Safety and Family Well-being Plan, as critical 
investments that in total would represent a $153 million investment in state and community programs 
and services to keep Maine children safe by keeping their families strong. Thank you.
