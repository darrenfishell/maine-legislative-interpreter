Greetings and thank you for your time. My comment regards funding for the Maine 
Healthy Soils Program. 
This past Sunday I learned how Growing to Give / Scatter Good Farm, a farming 
nonprofit in Brunswick, is using regenerative methods such as no-til, mulching, cover 
crops, and companion planting. I am very impressed at the observed benefits to the 
quality of the farm's soil compared to three years ago when they started using these 
methods. But most of all, I'm impressed about how simple these regenerative methods
are once established. It seems to me that any farm could implement these methods 
given sufficient education and support to make the transition. 
Better-quality soil leads to more nutrient-dense foods, and better health for the people 
who eat them.
In addition, better-quality soil can make a difference in climate change. The 
documentary "Kiss the Ground" (https://kissthegroundmovie.com) describes how 
regenerative farming can transform farms from negative climate impact to a positive 
one through the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in the 
soil. 
As a native and resident who is both appreciative of local wholesome foods, and 
concerned about the climate crisis, I would like every farm in Maine to have the 
knowledge and tools needed to maintain healthy soil. Please support this portion of 
LD 258 so that we can achieve that. Thank you.
