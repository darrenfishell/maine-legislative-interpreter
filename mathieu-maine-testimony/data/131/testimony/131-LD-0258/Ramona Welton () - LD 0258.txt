Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, members of the Committee on Appropriations and 
Financial Affairs, Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, member s of the Committee on 
Transportation, I’m Ramona Welton, writing as a private citizen on my own time and as both a member and immediate past president of my union, the Maine Service Employees Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union. My union represents over 13,000 Maine workers, including workers in all three branches of Maine State Government.  
I work as an Auditor II for the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles  (BMV) within the Maine 
Department of Secretary of State, where I am proudl y in my 39
th year of  service to my fellow 
Maine citizens . As a career public servant,  I’m here to provide you with a sense of what’s 
happening in terms of staffing right now  in the BMV as you make decisions on the proposed 
State Budget and LD 258, “An Act Making Unified Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund and Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain Provisions of the Law Necessary to the Proper Operations of State Government for the Fiscal Years Ending June 30, 2023, June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025" (Emergency) , (Governor's Bill)  
Sponsored by Representative Melanie Sachs .

The recruitment and retention problem is impacting the delivery of BMV  services statewide. Due 
to short staffing, some regional BMV offices occasionally have to close for parts of the day. The 
understaffing is particularly problematic in small offices like Calais . 
A number of entry- level positions are vacant in the BMV’s main office in Augusta. These 
positions can be difficult to fill. It’s phone work and the reality of entry-level jobs is folks often only stay long enough until they find a better-paying job elsewhere. The fact is, other Maine 
employers have been doing a much better jo b at providing pay that is much more attractive  than 
what the State of Maine currently  pays. High housing costs also are an issue in finding workers 
at BMV branch offices in communities like Portland and Scarborough, as well as communities 
like Augusta and Bangor. Even if folks can afford housing, they might not be able to afford to 
commute to these and other BMV offices at the rate the State currently pays.  
The constant churn of employees within the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles is threatening the 
institutional knowledge that BMV workers have passed on to each other. With big projects 
coming up such as plans for a new Maine license plate, as well as the ongoing new technology 
being incorporated into our work, it’s essential for the BMV  to have an experienced and 
qualified workforce so it can meet the needs of all Maine citizens regardless of where they live in our great state.  
Recruitment and retention , and low pay, are issue s impacting more than just the BMV . They are 
impacting  all department s of Maine State Government . The State of Maine Market Study Report
 
dated November 20, 2020, documents that State of Maine workers are underpaid, on average, 15 
percent compared to our counterparts throughout New England, even after adjusting for regional 
differences. For many State workers, it’s worse – accountants are underpaid by 20 to 33%; 
3 
 chemists, 24%; civil engineers, 20 to 25%; maintenance mechanics, 31%; correctional officers, 
16%; and correctional captains, 26% . 
It's past time that the State ends the State Employee Pay Gap. It’s the right thing to do – and it’s also necessary for the State to recruit and retain qualified workers for the kinds of positions the BMV is seeking to fill right now.  That’s why I respectfully ask that you include  funding in the 
proposed State Budget to end the State Employee Pay Gap. Thank you and I’m glad to answer any questions.
