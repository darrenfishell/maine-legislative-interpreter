Testimony of Maine Conservation Voters 
In support of LD 258 
An Act Making Unified Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund and 
Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain 
Provisions of the Law Necessary to the Proper Operations of State Government for 
the Fiscal Years Ending June 30, 2023, June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025
Before the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee
February 17, 2023
Good day Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and members of the 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee. My name is Beth Ahearn, 
Director of Government Affairs for Maine Conservation Voters. My testimony 
today focuses on the Community Resilience Partnership within the Governor’s 
Office of Policy Innovation and the Future (pages 289-290 of the budget 
document). The Community Resilience Partnership (CRP) was developed as a 
result of a recommendation of the Maine Climate Council in the Climate Action 
Plan entitled Maine Won’t Wait. The CRP provides resources to towns and Tribal 
governments to assist them in reducing carbon emissions, transitioning to clean 
energy, and building resilience to climate change effects like flooding and rising 
sea level. Since 2021, 131 communities have received grants from this partnership 
and other communities are clammering for these resources.
