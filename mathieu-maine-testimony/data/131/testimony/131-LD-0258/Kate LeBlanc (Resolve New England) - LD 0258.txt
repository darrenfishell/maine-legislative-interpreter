"An Act Making Unified Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund and Other Funds for 
the Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain Provisions of the Law Necessary to the

Dear Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs; Senator Bailey and Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing Committee o n Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services , 
 I have been the Executive Director of Resolve New England since January 2015. Resolve New England (RNE) is a non -profit organization that provides emotional support, education and advocacy 
for ALL those in New England that are struggling with fertility and family building.  
 We are so grateful to the  130
th legislature for passing  LD 1539, An Act to Provide Access to Fertility 
Care , and to Governor Mills for signing it into law and her continuous support. The law, which will 
take effect on January 1, 2024, w ill ensure that many more Maine rs will have  access to fertility 
coverage  so that they are able to try to grow much wanted families in Maine. When the bill was 
approved, one of the patient  advocates  said, “I feel hopeful for the first time in a long time.”  
   
I am testifying today in support of the  $3.8 million appropriation  in Section Z373  of LD 258 to  cover 
any potential cost of implementing this fertility  care  coverage , so that the hope created by passage 
of this law can be realized . 
 Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in support of this part of the state budget. RNE looks forward to assisting in any way that we can be helpful.  
 Sincerely,  
 
Kate Weldon LeBlanc  
Executive Director
