Senator Rotundo, Senator Baldacci, Representa$ve Sachs, Representa$ve Meyer, and dis$nguished members of the Appropria$ons and Financial Aﬀairs and Health and Human Services CommiYees, my name is Stephen Mills. I am a semi-re$red pediatric den$st who has prac$ced in Maine for 36 years. In addi$on, I have had the honor of par$cipa$ng on the Board of Directors of the Children!s Oral Health Network of Maine. I!m tes$fying to extend my deepest apprecia$on to the administra$on for their decision to include fund-ing for the school oral health program in the change package. This investment demonstrates their recog-ni$on of the importance of preven$ve oral health care for our children in Maine. I also want to express my gra$tude to the Health and Human Services commiYee for their con$nued support of oral health issues by priori$zing this funding during this session.  I am becoming somewhat comfortable with this process and it never ceases to impress me as to your level of commitment to the people of the State.  The acknowledgement of the ﬁnancial needs of this program is just another example of this.  Thank you from the boYom of my heart.  And of course,  if you have any ques$ons about pediatric den$stry as it exists here in the State of Maine as well as na$onally, I am always happy to help!
