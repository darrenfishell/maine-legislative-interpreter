Testimony in support of the Governor’s Proposed Initiatives Relating to Behavioral  
Health Services and Response to the Opioid Crisis  
February 2 4, 2023  
Greetings Senator s Rotundo and Baldacci , Representatives Sachs and Meyer,  and honorable 
members of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriation and Financial Affairs (AFA) and 
Health and Human Services ; my name is Lee Klarman , Director Health  at United Way of 
Southern Maine (UWSM).  
I am here today to express United Way of Southern Maine’s (UWSM) strong support for the 
investment s in the proposed biennial budget  regarding the  rate increases for behavioral health 
services, the expansion of children’s behavioral health services, and funding to address the 
growing opioid crisis. The behavioral health system needs  more robust support to remedy  
program closures, extended waitlists, and rationing of care . This is an opportunity to strengthen 
support for  the State’s behavioral health system . 
There is growing concern and public recognition around  mental health in Maine communities. 
The rate of suicide deaths  in Maine  was 19 per 100,000 in 2020 , an increase from 16.8 in 
2016 .1 In 2021, 46% of Mainers who did not access health care did so because of cost.2  For 
individuals living with mental illnesses and substance use disorders, access to affordable, 
quality health care is essential for treatment and recovery. Access to behavioral health care 
services can identify health conditions early on and provide opportunities for prevention. UWSM 
supports the proposed rate increases for behavioral he alth care services (on pages A -370-372), 
which will increase the number of providers able to provide these essential services to 
individuals and families across the State. 
Children and youth in Maine , especially,  are experiencing symptoms of mental illness at 
increasing rates. According to the Maine Integrated Youth Health (MIYH) Survey, 35.9% of high 
school students and 29.6% of middle school students felt sad or hopeless for more than two 
weeks in 2021.3 Moreove r, 20% of high schoolers and 18.5% of middle schoolers considere d 
suicide in 2021.4 In 2022, the rate of suicide for Maine youth was 16.8 per 100,000 deaths, an 
increase from 14.5 per 100,000 in 2021, and higher than the national rate of 10.8 per 100,000.5

These numbers peaked even  higher at the height of the COVID -19 pandemic. While some 
COVID Emergency Response Funds were dedicated to addressing this crisis, much of that 
funding has ended, leaving youth vulnerable. The proposed investment in children’s behavioral 
health services (A -366, 370, 393 -400), especially in  evidence -based tools and treatment options 
and infrastructure to support safe and consistent treatment delivery will help ensure positive 
health outcomes for children and families.  
 
Additionally, the opioid crisis has had a huge impact on Maine’s communities. 7 16 individuals 
died from an overdose in Maine in 2022, which is the highest since tracking began, and the 
State is already on track to surpass this number in 2023.6  130 of these deaths were in 
Cumberland County alone, and 101 were in York County. There were 10,110 overdoses in 2022  
-- showing that harm reduction efforts, specifically  the distribution of naloxone, are having 
positive impacts, altho ugh the overall rate of overdose continues to increase7. The additional 
funds included in the proposed budge t (A-408, 410) to address the opioid crisis by increasing 
naloxone distribution and strengthening treatment and recovery supports, such as expanding 
access to the OPTIONS Program, Recovery Coaches, Centers, and Residences  will expand the 
capacity of Medically Supervised Withdrawal (detox) programs, a critical service for ind ividuals 
starting their recovery.  
UWSM supports these proposed budgetary measures to address the growing mental health and 
substance use concerns across the State, and we urge legislators to do the same.  
I thank you for your leadership and service , and I am happy to answer any questions  you have.
