Dear Senator Rotundo, Repr esentative Sachs, and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs; Senator 
Bailey and Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee On Health Coverage, Insuranc e and Financial Services 
Committee,  
 First and foremost,  I am thankful to the legislature and to Governor Mills for 
passing the fertility insurance law last session. I care deeply about insurance 
coverage for fertility treatment. My husband and I have been  trying to have a 
child since 2018 , and I will be 39 in April. We have paid out of pocket for 3 
rounds of IUI , which were unsuccessful. Neither one of our insurances 
currently covers the cost of fertility tr eatments . If IVF ends up being our 
only option to have a child, we need this fertility coverage to  be able to do it 
because we can’t afford to pay out of pocket . The thought of not being able 
to have a child and start a family is sad. It will be wonderful for insurance 
compa nies to cover fertility  treatment in Maine  starting in 2024 . Please 
approve the funding in LD 258 , "An Act Making Unified Appropriations 
and Allocations from the General Fund and Other Funds for the 
Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain Provisions of the Law Necessar y to the Proper Operations of State Government for the Fiscal 
Years Ending June 30, 2023, June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025” to 
implement this law.  Having coverage for fertility treatment would help us in 
fulfilling our dreams of being parents and starting a family of our very own.   
 
Thank you,  
Tracy LaPlante  
Cornville, ME
