Greetings Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and honorable members of the Joint 
Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Committee on Labor and Housing . My na me is Bridget Quinn, and I am an Associate State 
Director for Advocacy and Outreach with AARP Maine. Today, on behalf of our 200,000 
Maine members, I am testifying neither in support or opposed on labor provision s LD 258 . 
 
In Maine, 181,000 unpaid family ca regivers provide nearly 152 million hours of care.1  
Many of these family caregivers provide support to their loved ones while also juggling a 
full or part time job . According to an AARP 2020 national survey nearly 61% of family 
caregivers were also emplo yed during their time as a caregiver.  On average, these 
caregivers worked 35.7 hours a week on top of their caregiving duties.  Family care 
partners who ’ve left work in order to provide care have reported that they left work for 
reason such as:   
• Needing more time to care for a l oved one;  
• Not being  able to afford to pay for help;  
• Being in a job that did not allow flexible work hours; or  
•Being in a job that does not allow for time -off with pay  
 
Caring for a loved one should not cost someone their job. Family caregivers are truly the 
backbone of our long -term care industry. By caring for a loved one Maine’s family 
caregivers delay institutional care and allow individuals  to remain at  home, where t hey 
want to be. Their critical work  prevents further burden s on our already stressed long term 
care industry.  
 
Paid leave benefits would be crucial in helping family caregivers continue to support their 
loved ones while also p rotecting their financial security.  That is why we urge to set aside

funds in the budget to cover  the startup  costs to make paid leave a reality  for Maine ’s 
unpaid family caregivers.
