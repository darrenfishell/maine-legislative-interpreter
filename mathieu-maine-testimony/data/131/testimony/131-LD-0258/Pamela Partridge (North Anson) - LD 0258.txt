Testimony Neither for nor Against LD 258, part HHHHH 
Honorable Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and other esteemed 
members of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, 
My name is Pamela Partridge and I live in North Anson. I retumed to 
college as a non traditional student in my mid thirties to becomea 
certiﬁed classroom teacher and retired after 25 years of teaching. In those 
25 years I taught adult education, middle level science, and the upper 
elementary grades. 
I am also the current President of SEAR, the Somerset Education 
Association Retired. 
I am here today to testify neither for nor against the Governor ’s proposed 
change package to LD 258, speciﬁcally related to part HHHHH of the 
proposal, a one-time ad hoc COLA of 3% for retirees. Last year we 
received a COLA bump, and I heard members of SEAR say they 
appreciated receiving the additional dollars, but they need a long term 
solution. Our members, particularly our older members with smaller 
pensions, feel this has been going on for too long. The lack of a sufﬁcient 
COLA has caused them stress in their ability to pay their bills. 
This proposal is a life line with a time limit. It would help meet current 
monthly costs that have blown up this past year due to inﬂation, but it 
doesn’t stop the snowballing gap between our monthly income and the 
cost of living. Again, there needs to be a more permanent solution to the 
COLA problem so that we have reliable, consistent protection from 
inﬂation, and not the growing erosion to our ability to pay our bills. 
Thank you for your time and for all you do for the people of the great 
state of Maine.
