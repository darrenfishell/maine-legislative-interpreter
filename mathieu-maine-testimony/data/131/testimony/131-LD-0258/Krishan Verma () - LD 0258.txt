My dear Honorable Legislators  
 
My Name is Krishan Verma and I have been a resident  of Lewiston for the past 50 years. I worked for the 
State of Maine Department of Developmental and intellectual disabilities for 35 years. I have also had 
the honor of closing The Pineland Center and placing the people with Disabilities into the community  
where they are leading daily normal lives. I am now retired and receiving the pension to make ends 
meet. My wife is still working to assist and fulfill our daily lives with her earnings.  
 
I would like to draw your attention to the pension  we retired work ers are receiving.  Unfortunately, the 
previous administration chose to first lay off state employees in big numbers "saying state employment 
was not an employment agency. ‚Äù On the other hand our pension was limited to 3% annual raise for the 
cost of living,  and it was restricted to only a given amount  of the benefit . In other words, the 3%  raise 
when applied to the whole amount was only 1% of the whole.. We all know that the current cost of 
living climbed 11.7% last year.  
 
I would like to request this honora ble body of legislators to expand our  cost of living  adjustment to the 
full amount now that we have the current budgetary means to do so.  
 
Krishan Verma
