Senators Rotundo and Ingwersen, Representatives Sachs and Pluecker, and Distinguished 
Members of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and 
Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry: 
My name is Bill Norbert. I am the Governmental Affairs and Communications Manager 
at the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) and submit this written testimony in support of the 
Governor’s proposed initiative contained in the “change package” to L.D. 258 related to the 
Dairy Improvement Fund , which is found on Page 45  of your materials. FAME administers 
this fund on behalf of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry. 
As you may recall, LD 258 originally proposed an initiative adjusting funding to the fund 
to bring allocations in line with projected available resources for Fiscal Year 2023-24 and Fiscal 
Year 2024-25. It reflected an increase of $42,788 in FY 23-24 and $43,883 in FY 24-25 from 
casino revenues. The Governor’s “change package” initiative on Page 45 now amends the prior 
initiative to update program allocations to align with projected revenues reflected in the May 
2023 Revenue Forecasting Committee report. These new allocations are $65,292 for FY 23-24 
and $71,048 for FY 24-25. We support these adjustments and hope you will, too. 
The Dairy Improvement Fund Program was created in 2011 by the Maine Legislature to 
help farms and dairy enterprises fund capital improvements to maintain and enhance the viability 
of their operations. Generally, any business or individual located in Maine and identified by the 
Department as engaged in commercial production of cow milk or cow milk products is eligible. 
Eligible uses include design, construction or improvement of milking parlors, dairy cattle 
housing, silos, grain bins, feed sheds, or the construction or renovation of buildings, or 

equipment, located in Maine and used in connection with a dairy enterprise. The program offers 
a 1% fixed interest rate on loans up to $250,000.  
Thank you for your consideration of my testimony. I would be happy to make myself 
available at a future work session.
