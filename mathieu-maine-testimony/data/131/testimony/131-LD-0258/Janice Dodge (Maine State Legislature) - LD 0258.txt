Testimony of Rep. Jan Dodge in support of 
Part HHHHH of the Budget Change Package 
Before the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee 
Good aftemoon, Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs. I am Representative Jan Dodge of 
House District #39, Belfast, Northpoit and Belmont. I am here to speak in support of Part 
HHHHH of the budget change package. 
The 3% ad hoc Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) will result in an average one-time beneﬁt of 
$527. This is not sufficient due to the depth and breadth of pension injustices imposed on 
teachers and certain state employees. These have been revealed, acknowledged and explained. 
Bills have proposed corrective measures for the unfairness in multiple facets of retiree 
compensation. We need the help of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee and the 
Chief Executive. 
LD 70 would eliminate the cap on the amount of a pension to which a COLA is applied. This 
bill had a preliminary ﬁscal note of $1.1 billion, yes, billion with a “b,” dollars. Please consider 
the level of ﬁscal harm experienced by a group that ﬁxing just one of their problems will cost 
$1.1 billion dollars. 
Another bill, LD 1096, would remove the 3% cap on the COLA. Please remember retired 
teachers and state employees do not ever receive cost of living adjustments in the 8 to 9% range 
like those who participate in Social Security. 
In the 130th Legislature, a bill passed to achieve Maine Income Tax parity with Social Security 
for MEPERS recipients by 2024. State, Federal and military retirement beneﬁts were only 
allowed a $10,000 deduction but are moving incrementally to a $35,000 deduction. 
LD 112 prompts consideration that retired teachers have paid a large percentage of their health 
insurance costs out of their meager pensions for decades. It took ﬁfteen years to increase 
beneﬁts by 10%. 
The budget balancing actions of 2011 and 2012 increased the penalty for retiring prior to age 62 
from 2.25% up to 6% for each year under the statutory age of retirement. That age is a moving
goal post of 59 and a half to 60, to 62 and then to 65. Some ﬁnd they have worked for 30 to 35 
years and still do not qualify for full retirement. I taught for 31 years and retired at age 54, andI 
lost 6% of my pension for each year I was under 60, the statutory age of retirement at the time. 
This is not a one-time penalty, but the formula that determined the calculation of the pension 
amount I will receive each year until I die. My loss is compounding over time. Further, some 
teachers chose to teach in school districts in rural Maine Where salaries were nearly the lowest in 
the state. That, too, reduces the pensions of many. 
In 11 years, my MEPERS pension has increased three-hundred two dollars and ninety-six cents 
($3 02.96), or an average yearly increase of twenty-seven dollars and ﬁfty-four cents ($27.54). I 
know EACH of my budget categories has increased by more than that amount! A few months 
ago, I bought a head of cauliﬂower for a pasta salad that cost nine dollars and change! 
Please expand this one-time correction and prioritize cumulative pension increases. This 
segment of Maine’s retirees has suffered the injustice of multiple assaults on their pensions. It is 
time to tum the tide. We have waited long enough. 
Thank you.
