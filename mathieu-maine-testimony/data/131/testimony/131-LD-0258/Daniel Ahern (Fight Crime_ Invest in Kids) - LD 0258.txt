FIGHT CRIME: 
INVEST IN KIDS COUNCIL FOR A STRONG AMERICA 
January 2023 
Dear Senator/Representative, 
Please accept our collective congratulations on being chosen by your fellow Mainers to be 
their voice in state government. There is little doubt that these next two years will be 
exciting and challenging ones as you and your colleagues work to forge a path forward as 
we come through the unprecedented times created by the pandemic. As you do this 
important work, we hope you will keep in mind that the strength and safety of our 
communities in the future are often grounded in the priorities and investments that you will 
be making during the 131st Legislature. 
We are writing as members of the anti-crime organization Fight Crime: Invest In Kids,a 
nonprofit organization including more than 140 law enforcement leaders in Maine, who 
know from our experience that research-based investments in kids help prevent later 
crime and make our communities safer. In addition, research shows that these 
investments can substantially save in corrections and other law enforcement costs over 
time. We are writing today to ask you to keep our youngest Mainers top of mind in your 
legislative work and to make funding programs that support our youngest children a 
priority. 
We hope you will join us in our collective commitment to provide high-quality early care and 
education that is affordable and accessible to all of Maine's youngest children, birth to age 8 no 
matter what county they live in. This includes growing high-quality, accessible and affordable 
child care; recruiting, developing, and retaining a solid child care workforce by increasing 
compensation and strengthening training pathways; and supporting pre-K expansion. in addition 
it is important that we improve data collection, tracking, and reporting across Maine's early 
childhood programs to help you as a policymaker monitor progress, impact, and quality 
improvements.‘ 
We offer an unexpected perspective on high-quality early learning - its impact on crime. 
Research clearly shows high-quality early care and education for at-risk kids not only can 
reduce their likelihood of committing a crime later in life, but also provides far greater 
savings than their cost. For example, a study of Chicago's Child-Parent Centers- — 
government-funded early education programs that have sen/ed 100,000 three-and four- 
year-olds —-found that at-risk kids left out of the program were 70 percent more likely to be

arrested for a violent crime by age 18 than kids who participated. At-risk kids left out of 
another high-quality program, the High/Scope Perry Preschool, were five times more likely 
to be chronic offenders with five or more arrests by age 27. Another, more recent 
example: an MIT study of the Boston preschool program found that enrollees were less 
likely to have been incarcerated in a juvenile facility during high school, compared to 
non-enrollees. These programs also save money. The High/Scope Perry preschool 
program cut crime and other costs so much that it saved taxpayers $16 for every $1 
invested, while the Child-Parent Centers program saved more than $10 for every $1 spent 
— with crime reduction costs being a big part of the savings. 
We recognize that there are many competing demands for resources. However, we are 
currently paying ~ in staggering criminal justice costs alone — for the previous inability to 
prioritize investments in evidence-based approaches that give our kids, at the youngest 
stages of development, the ability to become contributing members of society, rather than 
a huge drain on public coffers if they drop out of school and move towards crime. As law 
enforcement leaders we have watched too many kids grow up to become criminals. We 
urge you to prioritize early care and education program investments shown by research to 
give kids the right start in life and help keep them on track while saving taxpayers money. 
We hope we can count on you to make high-quality early learning a priority during the 
131"‘ Legislature. 
Thank you for your service to our great state. 
Sincerely, 
i,.,iiu...
