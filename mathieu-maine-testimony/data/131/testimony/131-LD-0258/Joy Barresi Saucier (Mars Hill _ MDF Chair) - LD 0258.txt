Testimony In Support of Funding in L.D. 258  
FY202 4-FY2025  “Biennial Budget Bill ,” 
for the Maine Development Foundation  
 
February 15, 2023  
 
Honorable Chairs and Members of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations & Financial 
Affairs and Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement & Business , 
 
My name is Joy Barresi Saucier of Mars Hill, Maine, and the current chair of the Board of Directors 
of the Maine Development Foundation, offering testimony on behalf of the Board in support of the 
proposed appropriation of  $58,444 annually to the Maine Development Foundation  (page A -191) . 
 MDF is a statewide non -profit, non -partisan membership organization uniquely established by the 
Legislature and the Governor in 1977 to work across the business, government, and education  
sectors to provide an objective, respected, long- range vision and strategies for growing Maine’s 
economy. We do this through our trusted economic research, leadership programs, and several signature public- private partnerships.  MDF’s annual budget is aro und $3 million, and state General 
Fund accounts for only about 5% of this total.  
 
The proposed budget currently supports two important programs at MDF.  First, the budget bill 
amount includes $33,444 annually for the Realize Maine Network.  The Realize Maine  Network is a 
coalition of locally -based organizations working together to retain and attract young people to 
Maine, empower them to reach their greatest career and civic potential, and create opportunities 
to keep them living, working, and thriving in our  state. The driving force behind the Network is its 
affiliated regional groups, each of which is autonomous and unique to a different place in Maine. 
Groups work independently and collaboratively to create opportunities for young people to 
network, build t heir communities, and pursue their aspirations. I hope the importance of this work 
– including Momentum Aroostook in my home region  – is self -evident.  
 
Second, the budget bill continues to include $25,000 annually to the Maine Downtown Center  
(MDC), as the Maine Legislature has provided since FY2012. The MDC was established in state law 
in 1999 as a public -private partnership based at MDF. The MDC’s mission is to advance 
preservation -based economic development in downtowns across Maine, resulti ng in business 
growth, job creation, building rehabilitation, cultural enhancement, and organizational leadership.  The MDC and its 15 -member professional Advisory Council serves as a clearinghouse and technical 
assistance resource for all Maine communitie s interested in undertaking downtown revitalization 
projects.  Dozens of Maine communities are involved, and the reinvestment statistics for the 
program are off the charts.  And I’ve seen firsthand the renewed energy that MDC has aided in bringing over the  years to communities such as Houlton, Presque Isle, and Madawaska.  
 
We are very appreciative of your support to keep the “public” in this successful public- private 
partnership. The leverage obtained from this General Fund support (less than 5% of the MDC ’s 
total budget) is exponential. Over the past four years, MDC has been awarded $2. 25 million in 
competitive federal grants and earmarks, of which $1.8 million has gone directly back out to 
numerous local communities alongside the technical assistance and know -how for stronger impact.

Fulfilling Commitments, Leveraging Potential, Realizing Opportunities  
We seek your support for the proposed appropriations and would be grateful for it. However, we 
also respectfully ask you to consider increasing the level of state General Fund investment in MDF 
overall to make up for years of inflation- eroded flat -funding; and to fulfill the original pledge  to 
match MDF’s private sector membership funding up to $250 ,000  per year (Public Laws 1977 c. 548, 
sec. 3) .  The State kept its pledge for about a dozen years after 1977 but since the recession and 
cutbacks of 1990 -91, has permanently shifted the burden for most of MDF’s work over to the 
private sector or competitive grants MD F can win.  Increasing state general operating support back 
to $250,000 would p rovide significant matching opportunities for MDF fundraising and grant -
writing.  The state founded MDF to be an engine for innovative long- term economic growth 
strategies and b ringing best practices here – that takes sustained and meaningful commitment.  
 
We would also request that added funding be considered to expand the reach of the MDC 
specifically to better serve rural and smaller service centers; better leverage outside inv estments; 
and achieve parity with the $200k total per year in Maine Community Development Block Grant 
(CDBG ) funding received by the MDC.  This would be an  additional $175,000 per year  for MDC, for 
a grand total of an additional $425,000 each year. We pledge we would match any state funding at 
least 1:1 with additional outside funding (and likely much more  with competitive grants ) -- even 
though currently MDF has already leveraged up state General Fund investments 20:1.  
 In addition to the work funded in the modest GF budget line item here, MDF is driving high -impact 
efforts for Maine leaders, communities, and economic sectors through its work – such as the Policy 
Leaders Academy for the Legislature; managing the FOR/Maine  and SEAMaine efforts for growth 
strategies for Maine’s innovating, evolving heritage forestry and fisheries i ndustries ; and workforce 
efforts through the MaineSpark collaborative, especially for adult learners who are going back to school and up -skilling.  The efficacy of these efforts was well- described in the Government 
Evaluation Act report for 2021 presented to IDEAB last year.  Most of these efforts are solely funded by private philanthropy or federal grants.  
 
We appreciate your consideration and supp ort for the proposed budget, and for additional 
investment that would augment and leverage the considerable private sector support MDF 
currently attracts to this powerful public -private partnership.  
 Sincerely,  
Joy Barresi Saucier, Chair
