Mission and Programs 
Maine Historical Society is a private 50l(c)3 non-proﬁt whose mission is to preserve and share Maine’s story. 
We are based in Portland, and work with communities and partners throughout the state. 
This is a signiﬁcant moment for MHS——in 2022, we celebrated our 200"‘ birthday as an institution. We have 
marked that occasion by focusing on preparing the organization for its third century of service to Maine. 
Maine Historical Society (MHS) was founded in l822——two years after Maine became a state— and has been 
collecting, preserving, and promoting research, scholarship, and engagement with Maine history ever since. 
Our program areas include the Brown Research Library, MHS Museum, and Maine Memory Network. 
(1) The Brown Research Library includes the most comprehensive collection of archival material related to 
Maine history and serves researchers, scholars, educators, students, genealogists, the general public, and 
professionals from across many ﬁelds. 
Through our research library, MHS supports extensive scholarly and collections activities —the foundation for 
meaningful civic dialog. MHS publishes the scholarly journal Maine History in partnership with the History 
Department at the University of Maine. We also host fellowships and scholarly forums, and have recently 
completed major collections care and access initiatives related to our photography, clothing, and architecture 
collections. 
With funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, we are just completing a major initiative to 
digitize our Proprietors and Northeast Boundary collections which document the settlement and distribution of 
land throughout Maine from the 17"‘ through 19"‘ centuries. It was a massive undertaking, and is now fully- 
accessible online through the Maine Memory Network. 
Maj or, recent collections acquisitions include the extensive archive of the Merrill Companies.
I encourage you to draw on us——our collections, knowledge, and staff are a tremendous resource for you in your 
work in the Legislature. MHS documents the evolution of virtually every aspect of Maine life and issue you 
address in your work here. 
(2) The MHS Museum offers changing exhibitions and public programs that use Maine history to provide context 
for issues of contemporary interest and concern. Recent major initiatives explored immigration, veterans ’ issues, 
Maine’s food heritage and economy, and Maine’s evolving paper industry. 
Our major Bicentennial exhibition, Holding Up the Sky: Wabanaki People, Culture, History & Art explored 
13,000 years of Wabanaki stewardship of Maine and was developed with eight Wabanaki co-curators. 
Our 2021 exhibition —Begin Again: Reckoning with Intolerance in Maine—explored how Maine ﬁts into the 
national dialog on race and equity. 
Our 2022 exhibition —Northem Tl2reads —-featured never-before-seen historic clothing from MHS’ 3,000-piece 
collection, which we recently digitized, rehoused, and conserved with a major federal grant. 
This year’s major exhibition, Code Red, opening in March, will explore the importance of the enviromnent to 
Maine’s identity and way of life, and how climate change may affect that. 
Each initiative includes an exhibition, digital resources, extensive public programs delivered via Zoom, and 
educational resources that support remote learning. All are available online via the Maine Memory Network. 
Our Museum also includes the Wadsworth-Longfellow House (1785-86), a National Historic Landmark. 
(4) Finally, the Maine Memory Network our nationally-recognized digital platform, 
empowers Maine communities to share their collections, stories, and perspectives. Maine Memory has evolved 
constantly since its launch in 2001 and is a robust platform for a wide range of historical interests and activity. It 
includes historical items contributed by 285 partners across Maine, hundreds of digital exhibits, educational 
resources, :1-/1'1-* .-ltrzitwe Stories—~a portal that enables individuals to share their stories, and .-'1-etuine lelisto/'st' {_)12!j,1,;j, a 
sprawling introduction to Maine. The model gives status to local knowledge and expertise, and radically expands 
the perspectives that are included in Maine history. New material is added constantly. I encourage you to visit and 
explore online—no doubt you will ﬁnd material from your corner of Maine. 
In addition to those program areas, we partner with and provide archival, curatorial, storage, and other services to 
individuals, institutions, and businesses. 
Public Service 
Through these activities, MHS serves approximately 500,000 people each year on our campus, through outreach 
programs, and online. 
Emplovees, Total Budget, and the General Fund 
MHS has a staff of 18 full-time and 16 part-time employees with a current annual total budget of approximately 
$2.25 million. Our budget is supported by individual philanthropy, membership, earned income, endowment, and 
foundation and government grants. In the proposed Bl6l')I1121l Budget for 2024-2025, MHS would receive $44,864 
annually from the State of Maine General Fund, or approximately 2% of our operating budget. 
Funding Initiative 
State funds received by Maine Historical Society support the development, maintenance, and outreach services 
provided through the _Maine Memory Network. Annual operating costs for Maine Memory are approximately 
$250,000 per year. In the current year, state funding accounts for 18% of its operations. Sustaining Maine Memory
as a free and vital public resource is one of MHS’ foremost strategic priorities. The state’s general fund allocation 
is essential to that. 
Our Third Century 
With that overview, I’d like to speak brieﬂy about our strategic focus. 
The MHS Board, Staff, Stakeholders, and I spent the latter part of the pandemic focused on developing a new 
2022-2027 MHS Business Plan that lays the foundation for MHS’ Third Century. 
Our Business Plan outlines 5 critical paths and 22 initiatives that will guide us as we transform MHS from a small 
but mighty organization that consistently ﬁghts above its weight to one that has the capacity and resources to 
inspire and be a source of perspective for all people who care about Maine. 
Speciﬁc goals include: 
0 To leverage MHS’ signiﬁcant assets to grow audience, increase revenue, and expand ﬁnancial capacity 
0 To methodically and sustainably grow our annual operating budget from $2 million to $3.5 million 
0 To create the inﬁastructure needed to seamlessly serve MHS’ digital and in person audiences. 
Each activity is measured by Key Performance Indicators, including Revenue, Capacity, Partnership, and 
Audience. 
The Plan invests in and draws on the incredible assets and expertise that MHS built over the past 200 years-—@e_ 
cornerstone of our mission, work, and future, and the core of what we have to offer the people of Maine. 
These assets include: 
0 the premiere collection of historical material documenting the Maine Experience; 
0 deep and expansive knowledge about Maine that grows every day; 
professional staff skilled at facilitating research, telling stories, and making connections; 
landmarks including the Wadsworth-Longfellow House & Garden and Brown Research Library; 
state-of-the art collections facilities; 
0 the groundbreaking Maine Memory Network; 
Q a museum dedicated to exploring how Maine is shaped by its history; and, 
0 two campuses bristling with potential. 
We also have one other essential asset: the unique “Maine-ness ” of our mission. 
The love that people across the state—and far beyond—have for Maine is a powerful force and provides a 
remarkable foundation and focus for MHS’ work. 
We have built an organization dedicated to exploring what makes Maine “Maine” , and to drawing together and 
sharing the stories and contributions that people from every corner of the state—and from Away—make to the 
Maine Experience. 
We look forward to sharing more about our plans and collaborating with you in the months and years ahead. 
We are now completing a new Audience Engagement Plan that will guide program development, and launch a new 
brand and institutional website this month. We will be launching expanded digital content this year, and a new 
membership program. There is lots going on! 
Thank you so much for your interest and support. I’d be happy to answer any questions.

Responding to Interests and Issues in Maine Today 
Begin Again: reckoning with intolerance in Maine 
May 27-December 31, 2021 
Description 
A pandemic, political unrest, race-based violence, and drastic economic 
inequities in 2020 spurred conversations about intolerance in America and 
Maine. During this crisis, many asked, How did we get here? Begin Again: 
reckoning with intolerance in Maine explored the centuries old histories 
behind the roots of injustice and discrimination in Maine. This exhibition 
examined different paths of experiences in Maine and the sometimes 
difficult and shocking histories. Begin Again ‘s installation promoted 
empathetic and emotional responses. We purposely obscured colonial maps 
with Indigenous objects, and large graphics drew attention to topics. Spatial 
design, especially the division of the room by a curtain, communicated 
Begin Again explored MHS as a colonialist institution and asked Who is missing? to engage visitors in a dialog 
about the role of museums and representation. Curators and a network of advisors from around the state 
invited visitors to work toward healing through truth, and "Begin Again," envisioning a more equitable 
experience for all of Maine's residents in the future. By truly collaborating, we ceded the typical museum 
authority dynamic and acknowledged there are perspectives on Maine history which have been left out or 
subjugated over the centuries, and are necessary to contextualize why Maine is the whitest state in the 
nation.

State of Mind: Becoming Maine explored Maine as the homeland of the 
Wabanaki people, as a European province, as part of the District of 
Massachusetts, and the State of Maine. lt considered Maine's Bicentennial 
milestone in relation to Maine's formation as a state 200 years ago; the 
significance of the Missouri Compromise; how the idea of "Maine" is perceived 
by people today; and how the changing landscape could alter Maine's future. 
The exhibition featured manuscripts and items relating to statehood, historic 
maps, contemporary artwork, and opportunities to learn about the 
experiences of Wabanaki people alongside the early settlers, including: 
European American, African American, and Acadian communities.

Holding Up the Sky: Wabanaki People, Culture, History & Art 
April 12, 2019 -February 1, 2020 
Description 
Holding up the Sky explored Wabanaki philosophies of 
leadership and obligation relating to humans and non-humans 
by highlighting 13,000 years of Wabanaki residence in what is 
now known as Maine. Wabanaki co-curators guided the 
exhibition, interpreting 17th century colonial treaties, 
photographs, heritage items, and contemporary artworks- 
everything from ash baskets to haute couture fashion.

Paper has shaped Maine's economy, molded individual and 
community identities, and impacted the environment throughout 
Maine. When Hugh Chisholm opened the Otis Falls Pulp Company in 
Jay in 1888, the mill was one of the most modern paper-making 
facilities in the country, and was connected to national and global 
markets. For the next century, Maine was an international leader in 
the manufacture of pulp and paper. Making Paper, Making 
Maine recognized the historic transition taking place in Maine's 
paper industry, and asked, what's next for Maine's economy?

Co-curated by Tilly Laskey and Reza Jalali, a Kurd from Iran, 
educator, writer, scholar, human rights and refugee activist who 
has lived in Maine since 1985 and currently works for the 
University of Southern Maine. The exhibition was based upon

Beest, an immigrant from the Netherlands who has lived in 
Maine since 1970. The exhibition was augmented with items 
from MHS's permanent collections and loans from the

with the flags of their home countries. The Buoys were installed 
on the historic iron gate of MHS's Wadsworth Longfellow House. 
Major themes in 400 Years of New Mainers were racism and nationalism, including the KKK in Maine. Street 
artist Pigeon was commissioned to wheat paste his series, the Mainer Project on the front of MHS's museum 
building as well as on the gallery walls.

A Convenient Soldier: the Black Guards of Maine 
Fall 2020 
Direct collaborator Description 
The Black Guards were African American army soldiers 
sent to guard the railways of Maine during WWII, from 
1941-1945. The purpose of their deployment was to 
prevent terrorist attacks along the railways to keep 
Maine citizens safe during the war. 
This installation looks at the day-to-day lives of these 
loyal citizen-soldiers who stood watch during a time of 
a racially segregated country and military. Their watch 
embodied the incongruity they faced straddling a 
complex state of racism, and a citizenship that was 
exercised as a matter of convenience during war-time. 
Asata Radcliffe, African American and Indigenous writer and multi-media artist
