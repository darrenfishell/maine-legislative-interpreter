We are in a state of profound state of ecological change, in which no previously held 
paradigm is wholly adequate to meet this moment. What we do know is that 
agriculture that works in partnership with our ecology, rather than purely extractive, 
will be required to sustain Maine families and Maine culture. This is where we lead a 
nation largely in denial about the future we face. We should continue our tradition of 
quiet, independent leadership by example.
This is why I urge you to support the Maine Healthy Soils Program and Farmers 
Drought Relief Grant Program with healthy, full funding. Maine farmers need each 
other and a locus of scientific as well as knowledge gained through shared experience 
in order to meet the challenges of the future and ensure the independence of our 
livestock, vegetables, fruits and other plants.
Please work to provide FULL funding for these two programs.
