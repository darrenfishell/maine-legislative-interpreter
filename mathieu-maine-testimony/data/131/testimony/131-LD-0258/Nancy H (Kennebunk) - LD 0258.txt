LD 258  
This is Nancy , I work for Vocational Rehabilitation as a Counselor 2 . I’ve been working for the State for 
nine years, going onto my tenth year , and this has been the most challenging  time  over  the past two 
years . One is the financial hardships ; I have two kids in colleg e, and I’m trying to budget and get them 
through . I often get called back to my old job, which is $10 -15k more in Mass than it is in Maine, but I 
would rather stay working for Maine. But I’m really struggling . There are many staff that ar e leaving and 
we used to have 18 -19 staff members. Now w e’re down to a staff of 8 -9 people, but there aren’t very 
many willing to work here because the salary is below what the average salary is for step one – it’s way 
below $50k. People are leaving , and i t seems like my caseload has increased . It affects my health, my 
medical status, I’m having to pay more medical bills and pay for my hearing aids and whatnot . Because  
of the stress, it’s impacting my health, so that’s why we need additional funds  to raise wages.
