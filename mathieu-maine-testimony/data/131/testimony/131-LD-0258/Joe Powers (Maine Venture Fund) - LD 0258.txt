Senator Rotundo, Senator Curry, Representative Sachs, Representative Roberts, and 
Distinguished Members of the Committees:
My name is Joe Powers. I am the Managing Director of the Small Enterprise Growth 
Fund, known as Maine Venture Fund, or “MVF”. I live in Portland and am here to 
testify in support of the Governor’s proposed biennial budget as it relates to 
continuing the $500,000 in ongoing funding for the Maine Venture Fund.
As you heard in the testimony of Bill Norbert, who manages government affairs on 
behalf of MVF via his role at FAME, this funding is critical to sustaining MVF’s 
presence in the state as a long-standing resource for innovative companies who are 
seeking to grow jobs aggressively in the state. 
The investments made by the Fund are themselves “evergreen”, in that any returns are
recycled into other Maine companies, rather than paid out to my team, as would be 
the case for a private sector venture fund, which makes this ongoing funding all the 
more important. This funding offsets the majority of the administrative expense of 
running our public Fund structure and expands the amount of capital available to 
Maine-based companies so that they can more quickly grow quality jobs in the state. 
Thank you for your consideration of my testimony. I would be happy to answer any questions 
you might have.
