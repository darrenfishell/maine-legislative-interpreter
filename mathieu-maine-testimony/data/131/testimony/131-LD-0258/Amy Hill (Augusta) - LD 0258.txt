To the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee  
 
I am submitting testimony on my own time on the budget regarding the importance of funding 
public services and addressing continued retention issues. I have been a state employee 
working for DHHS for over 25 years. The importance of funding public services and retention 
continues to be a concern.   
 
During my years of state service, I have seen high to impossible caseloads, lack of resources, 
lack of support from management, and lack of training to support the job.   To continue to 
provide quality services, it is important  to provide funding to retain and attract well qualified 
workers. It is important to stay competitive with the private sector. I have seen people leave 
because they have found jobs that have better benefits and/or salary as well as less stress due 
to more manageable job duties.   
 
DHHS has been an ever evolving system with changes in management, direction of services, 
changes in technology, and policy. As a state employee, this is very challenging to continue to 
manage on a direct care level.   
 
The need to  adequately fund public services can make a difference in the quality, longevity of 
workers, the amount of experience state employees have, and attract more qualified workers.   
 
I urge the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee to address the pay gap in comparison 
to other states, to adequately fund and prevent staff shortages, and to have adequate resources 
such as training and technology.
