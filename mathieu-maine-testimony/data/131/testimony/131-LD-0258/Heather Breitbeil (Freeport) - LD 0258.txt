We are thankful to the legislature and to Governor Mills for passing the fertility 
insurance law last session. Please approve the funding in the state budget that the 
Governor feels is needed to implement this law. I care deeply about insurance 
coverage for fertility treatment and have had a lengthy journey with infertility, along 
with the emotional, physical, and economic toll it takes.
My husband and I started our fertility treatment journey in 2014 knowing that in the 
State of Maine, this was going to be an out of pocket expense. At the time we had no 
idea what that would actually mean- that the first time was not 'guaranteed', that the 
meds were not covered by insurance, and that nothing and I mean nothing could heal 
the pain of a failed IVF cycle. 
We successfully became pregnant via IVF with our first son, born in June of 2015, 
and had our second son via IVF in early 2017. Our third miracle took about 3 years of
repeated cycling, repeated miscarriages and nonstop heartache but we are happy to 
say our family is complete thanks to science and the fact that we had the "privilege" 
of figuring out how to make it all work financially. 
All in, we spent about $150,000 for IVF without insurance coverage. This was, and 
still is, an added stress to an already incredibly stressful process. The financial burden
is something I hope will not be such a burden for others moving forward and I 
sincerely appreciate your continued support of this bill.
Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, and thank you for your support!
