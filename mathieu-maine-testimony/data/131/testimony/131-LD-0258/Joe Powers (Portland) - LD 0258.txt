Senator Rotundo, Senator Curry, Representative Sachs, Representative Roberts, and 
Distinguished Members of the Committees:
My name is Joe Powers. I am the Managing Director of the Small Enterprise Growth 
Fund, known as Maine Venture Fund, or “MVF”. I live in Portland and am here to testify in 
support of the Governor’s proposed biennial budget as it relates to continue the $500,000 in 
ongoing funding for the Maine Venture Fund.
As you heard in the testimony of Bill Norbert, who manages government affairs on 
behalf of MVF via his role at FAME, this funding is critical to sustaining MVF’s presence in the 
state as a long-standing resource for innovative companies who are seeking to grow jobs 
aggressively in the state. 
The investments made by the Fund are themselves “evergreen”, in that any returns are 
recycled into other Maine companies, rather than paid out to my team, as would be the case for a 
private sector venture fund, which makes this ongoing funding all the more important. This 
funding offsets the majority of the administrative expense of running our public Fund structure 
and expands the amount of capital available to Maine-based companies so that they can more 
quickly grow quality jobs in the state. 
Thank you for your consideration of my testimony. I would be happy to answer any 
questions you might have.
