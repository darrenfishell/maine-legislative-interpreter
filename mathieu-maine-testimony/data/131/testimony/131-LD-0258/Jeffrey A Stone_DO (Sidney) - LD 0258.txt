Senator Rotundo, Senator Baldacci, Representative Sachs, Representative Meyer, and 
members of the
Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Health and Human Services Committees, 
my name is Dr. Jeff
Stone. I have been a pediatrician for 30 years in my hometown of Waterville and am 
the founder of
Waterville Pediatrics.
I want to express my sincere gratitude to the administration for including funding for 
the school oral
health program in the change package. Every day as a pediatrician I saw the 
devastation of the lack of
adequate access to dental care in my patients. I would see kids with multiple dental 
cavities, painful
teeth, and tooth abscesses due to inadequate or nonexistent dental care. Funding the 
School Oral
Health Program is crucial in addressing the oral health needs of our children, as oral 
health plays a vital
role in their overall well-being.
I would also like to extend my appreciation to the Health and Human Services 
committee for their
continued support of oral health issues and their commitment to ensuring that our 
children receive the
dental care they deserve.
