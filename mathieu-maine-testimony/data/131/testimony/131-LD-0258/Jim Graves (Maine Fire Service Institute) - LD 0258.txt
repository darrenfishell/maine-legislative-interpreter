Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Beebe-Center and Representative Suzanne Salisbury, Members 
of the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and the Joint Standing Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety, I am Jim Graves, the Director Fire Training at the Maine Fire Service institute 
located at Southern Maine Community College. 
lt is with great pride that I write to make you aware of the Regional Fire Training Programs that have been made 
available with the funding that was provided initially through LD73l and is now included in the Governor ’s 
proposed budget (A-138). In early January, the Maine Fire Protection Services Commission made seven (7) full 
and/or partial awards to regional ﬁre ﬁghter I & ll programs across the state. 
This is above and beyond our normal operations at the Maine Fire Service Institute. With this funding we are able 
to grow our Pro-Board Certiﬁed Fire Instructor offerings in hopes to create a trickle~down effect to help make ﬁre 
departments somewhat able to be self-suf ﬁcient with regards to training their personnel at the local level. 
Moreover, we have been able to expand our Pro-Board Certiﬁed Fire Ofﬁcer l Program to raise the level of 
training and education of Maine’s Fire Service. Sadly, the demand is still at a point that even with these 
additional funds we cannot completely meet the demand from all regions of our state. We have heard from the 
towns of Fryeburg, Denmark, Limerick, Stocking Springs, Searsport and Northern York County that are 
desperately seeking ﬁre training programs. Unfortunately, we have had to ask them to apply for the next round of 
grants (should we continue to be funded). With that said, we hope you will continue to support this much needed 
funding to our States Fire Service Training programs, as we will continue to work hard to see our State’s 
ﬁreﬁghters receive the best training possible. 
Below is a list of regional ﬁreﬁghter l & ll program awards for your review. We were not able to grant all that 
requested training support. 
l will be happy to answer any questions you may have, and my apologies for not being in attendance today. 
Respectfully, 
James A Graves, Director of F ire Training
