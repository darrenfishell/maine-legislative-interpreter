Testimony of Anne L. Head, Commissioner 
Department of Professional and Financial Regulation 
February 15, 2023 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and 
the Joint Standing Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business 
LD 258 "An Act Making Unified Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund and Other 
Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain provisions of the Law Necessary 
to the Proper Operations of State Government for the Fiscal Years Ending June 30, 2023, June 30, 2024 
and June 30, 2025" 
Good morning, Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs; Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business. My name is Anne L. Head, 
and I am the Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation. I am here today to 
testify in support of the biennial budget bill, LD 258. 
This budget advances the Governor ’s guiding belief that to build a stronger, more prosperous state where 
opportunity is available to all, then we must invest in the infrastructure that supports the people of Maine, our 
greatest asset. 
That is why this budget proposal strengthens the very things that Maine people rely on every day to succeed, 
building on the strong success of the currently enacted budget and the last legislative session to tackle Maine’s 
greatest challenges. 
We have governed cautiously and in a fiscally prudent way over the past four years, making sure that - even in 
the hardest of times during the pandemic - we lived within our means. This budget proposal continues that 
practice. 
We look forward to the discussions over the next several months as we outline each initiative and impact of the 
proposed investments. 
I am pleased to present information to both committees regarding the Governor ’s biennial budget request for the 
Department of Professional and Financial Regulation ’s Administrative Services Division, Office of Professional 
and Occupational Regulation and the Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers, one of six licensing 
programs affiliated with the Department. The term “affiliated ” indicates that these licensing programs havea

statutory connection to the Department through the state budget process. Affiliated boards have their own staff, 
and each board develops its own budget under the general oversight of the Department. 
In addition to the three programs I will be discussing today, there are four financial services agencies within the 
Department and five affiliated boards under the oversight of the Joint Standing Committee of Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services. These are the Bureau of Insurance, the Bureau of Financial Institutions, the 
Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection, the Office of Securities, the Board of Licensure in Medicine, Board of 
Nursing, Board of Optometry, Board of Dental Practice and Board of Osteopathic Licensure. Budget 
information on these programs will be presented on March lst. 
As a whole, the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation is charged with the important role of 
protecting the health, safety and welfare of citizens of Maine through the regulation of State-chartered financial 
institutions, the insurance industry, grantors of consumer credit, the securities industry, and numerous 
professions and occupations providing services to the public through licensing, examination, and auditing 
activities; by conducting programs aimed at increasing voluntary compliance with State laws; by investigating 
possible violations of law; and by undertaking enforcement actions. By encouraging the development of sound 
ethical businesses which serve the needs of Maine citizens, the Department fosters a healthy business 
environment through competent, impartial and efficient regulation. 
It is important to note, that our budget contains no General Fund appropriations or initiatives. The Department 
is funded exclusively with dedicated revenue and relies on Other Special Revenue Funds as the sole source of 
revenue to fund Department operations. 
Administrative Services Division - 0094 
I will begin with the Administrative Services Division on pages A-557 and A-558. The Division, which 
includes the Commissioner ’s Office, provides overall management and administrative oversight for the 
Department ’s five regulatory agencies and six affiliated boards in the areas of policy development, legislative 
support, technology services, accounting, budgeting, facility management, personnel and information 
management, centralizing functions to ensure efficient operations and compliance with statutory and public 
service responsibilities. The Division is supported by Other" Special Revenue Funds transferred from the 
agencies and boards within and affiliated with the Department. 
The baseline budget request for this program provides funding to continue administrative support for 
Department. This program has five initiatives. 
The lst initiative reﬂects a net increase in funding for services provided by MaineIT. Please note that this 
account procures technology for all agencies within the Department, so the increase of $87,705 in FY24 and 
$87,892 in FY25 is the estimated increase in cost for the Administrative Service Division as well as the 5 other 
programs within the Department. Estimated cost of services provided by MainelT is based on current usage and 
FY24/25 MaineIT rates. 
The 2“d initiative increases funding for technology services not procured through MaineIT by $502,970 
annually. This program is responsible for the support and maintenance of the Agency License Management 
System (ALMS) software program. The ALMS software is currently used by several of the State's regulatory 
agencies for licensing, complaint management and reporting. Increasing the existing contract will 
accommodate changes needed to address the software's increased usage across multiple agencies, add 
enhancements required to implement new legislation, and to convert the software to a web-based user interface.
2
The 3"‘ initiative increases funding for services by the financial and human resources service center within the 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services by $131,979 annually. As with services provided with 
MaineIT, this estimate represents the increased cost for all 6 programs within the Department. Estimated costs 
for service center support is based on estimates provided by DAFS. 
The 4”‘ initiative establishes and provides funding for a one Public Service Manager I position to serve asa 
communication liaison and training coordinator for ALMS users; understanding the business needs and 
processes of each of the ALMS programs to provide guidance on the most effective use of the tools and 
functionality available; providing training and training documentation; and facilitating streamlined and efficient 
use of the ALMS application. The estimated cost of the position including Personal Services and All Other is 
$ 107,242 in FY2024 and $113,062 in FY2025. 
The final initiative at the top of page A-558 increases funding by $20,532 in FY24 and $20,525 in FY25 for the 
proposed reorganization of the Assistant to the Commissioner position to a Deputy Commissioner. The position 
acts on behalf of the Commissioner in the performance of statutory responsibilities by performing delegated 
functions and accepting delegated responsibilities. This proposed reorganization aligns the position 
compensation with the duties and responsibilities of the position.

Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers — 0369 
The next program I will be discussing is the Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers on page A-561. The 
Board protects the public safety and welfare of the people of Maine through the licensing of qualified applicants 
for an engineer license and regulation of the practice of engineering. The Board is supported solely by Other 
Special Revenue Funds generated from licensing fees. The Board consists of seven members appointed by the 
Governor and employs an executive director and one administrative staff member. 
The Board elects a Chair from its members. Brent Bridges P.E. is the current Board Chair. 
The baseline budget request for this program continues funding for administrative operations such as staff, 
complaint investigation, and board member travel and compensation. 
The Board has three initiatives. 
The ls‘ initiative increases allocation by $12,230 annually for professional services. The Board anticipates 
additional funding will be needed for expenses related to hearings. 
The next initiative increases funding for services provided by the Office of the Attorney General by $1,442 in 
FY24 and $2,120 in FY25. Cost for legal services is based on estimates provided by the AG’s Office. 
The 3rd initiative increases allocation by $21,403 in FY24 only. The Professional Engineers Board operates 
with a biennial license cycle, requiring additional allocation in even fiscal years for expenses associated with 
processing license renewals. This is a recurring initiative as the baseline budget is calculated from the odd 
fiscal year.

Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation - 0352 
The Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation (OPOR), on page A-567 and A-568, is an umbrella 
administrative agency for 37 professional and occupational regulatory programs. The Office protects the public 
against unqualified, incompetent and unethical practitioners through licensure, establishment of practice 
standards, inspection, complaint investigation and, when warranted, imposition of professional discipline. Full- 
time staff and board members appointed by the Governor implement license qualifications determined by the 
Legislature, set standards of practice and ethical behavior, and assist in conducting disciplinary proceedings. 
The program is funded with Other Special Revenue Funds, primarily from license fees. 
The Other Special Revenue baseline budget request for this program is a consolidation of the budget requests 
for the 37 individual programs and provides allocation for shared administrative operations such as 
administrative staff, complaint investigation and rent, as well as providing funding for program-specific needs 
such as inspection staff and rulemaking. 
The program also has $200,000 baseline allocation in FY2024 for Federal Expenditures Fund ARPA funds. 
The Office received funding to support Governor Mill’s 10-year Economic Development plan expanding 
Maine’s workforce. Funds will be used to assist individuals seeking work in Maine to obtain their highest level 
of licensure. 
The program has three initiatives relating to the Other Special Revenue Fund budget. 
The lst initiative transfers positions and allocation from the Board of Dental Practice to OPOR, reflecting a 
proposed change in status of the Board of Dental Practice from a program affiliated with the Department toa 
component program of the Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation. The Department can better 
support board function through this status change without impacting the Board’s statutory authority or 
processes. The proposed restructuring will put the Board in an improved financial and staff resource position, 
enabling both the Board and OPOR to realize efficiencies through shared resources. Increases to position count 
and allocation in OPOR will be offset with decreases to the Board of Dental Practice. Both the Dental budget 
(page A-560) and proposed language (Part NNN) are scheduled for public hearing on March 1“ , to be held in 
conjunction with the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services, anda 
copy is attached for your reference. 
The 2nd initiative increases funding for vehicle leased through DAFS Central Fleet Management by $55,668 in 
FY2024 and $67,848 in FY2025. Estimated cost is based on rates provide by Central Fleet Management. 
The 3rd and final initiative for this program is requesting to establish headcount and make permanent one 
Public Service Executive II position previously established by Financial Order. This is a senior policy position 
that will provide advanced legal analysis skills to the Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation and 
advise the director on emerging policy issues. The position will enable the Office to meet higher demand for 
licensed behavioral and physical health practitioners and licensed trade professionals. This position is 
especially important due to the heightened focus on the Office's ability to manage all aspects of professional and 
occupational licensing for Maine and increased pressure on the agency to expedite the licensing process to 
expand Maine's workforce. There is also greater focus on legal licensing issues that emerge as states look for 
ways to encourage workers from other states and countries to join Maine's workforce. The estimated cost of the 
position including Personal Services and All Other is $142,115 in FY24 and $149,864 in FY25.
