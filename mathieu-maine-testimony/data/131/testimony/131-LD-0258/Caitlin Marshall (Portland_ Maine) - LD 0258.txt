Dear Sen. Rotundo and Rep. Sachs,  
 
The Maine Climate Corps is a great opportunity for Mainers.   It's not a huge outlay, compared to many 
other line items on the state budget, but the rewards are many: creation of jobs to attract and keep 
young Mainers, encouraging the growth of the fossil -free economy, and of course, helping to turn the 
tide against climate  change.  
 
With smoke from out of control wildfires darkening the skies in states all aro und us, even causing air 
quality warnings here in Maine, the climate crisis is indisputably here.   But we can meet this darkness 
with hope, in programs like the Climate Corps.   AmeriCorps is a proven, well established program 
nationwide and in Maine.   The Climate Corps will extend this successful model to meet this greatest 
challenge of our time.  
 
Thank you for your service, and for your consideration of this important bill.  
 
Sincerely,  
Caitlin Marshall  
Portland, Maine
