LD 258
“Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and 
honorable members of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs
and Health and Human Services: 
My name is Habone and I am here today to testify in favor of LD 199. I live in 
Lewiston, I am a mother of a 6 years old daughter. My husband died in a car accident 
three years ago while on duty for a transportation company. 
I was new then when my husband died in that tragedy. I did not know or have means 
to support myself. I lost the Mainecare six months after the delivery of my child. 
Since then I cannot afford going to the doctor or doing any annual medical check ups. 
For years I live without health care insurance and if I feel sick I buy my meds from 
the pharmacy. It’s hard to be in the shoes of someone who feels left behind. I don’t 
believe it’s a matter of affordability for the state or the country but this is more about 
a choice for those who are deciding who should have access to healthcare. .
I have a daughter who is an American citizen and every time I get sick, I have 
tremendous fear of  passing on dangerous viruses or diseases. Going to the doctor is a 
huge challenge because of the cost of one visit or a prescription. For example I have a
list of medications that I could not afford and a therapy session that was prescribed for
me for muscle pain. 
If I have access to healthcare, it will be a big moral uplifting and a boost for  my 
mental and physical health. A healthy mother can raise a healthy child otherwise it’s a
heavy burden on my heart.  
For that reason, I am calling you Honorables committee, to pass LD 199 for our 
families and public health investment. 
Thank you
