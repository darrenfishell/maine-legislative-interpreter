LD 258 
 
 
Distinguished Appropriations Committee Members, 
The Franklin County Jail has seen between 7-30% increases in the contracted services required by the State to 
provide the inmates at the Jail facility. The request for proposal process for Mental Health and Medical contractors 
in our rural area was a challenge. We only received on bidder and the cost was roughly 30% higher than we had 
budgeted for. These costs are not optional and therefore they should be considered when discussing State funding. 
We humbly request that LD 258 be voted in favor to pass to assist all the Countries with providing the services the 
State requires for the inmate population. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Amy L Bernard, MPA 
Franklin County Administrator
