Good afternoon, Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs; Senator Beebe-Center, Representative 
Salisbury, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. 
My name is Michael Sauschuck, and I am the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety. 
I am here today to testify in support of the biennial budget. 
Overall Budget 
This budget advances the Governor ’s guiding belief that to build a stronger, more 
prosperous state where opportunity is available to all, we must invest in the infrastructure that 
supports the people of Maine, our greatest asset. 
That is Why this budget proposal strengthens the very things that Maine people rely on 
every day to succeed, building on the strong success of the currently enacted budget and the last 
legislative session to tackle Maine’s greatest challenges. 
We have governed cautiously and in a ﬁscally prudent way over the past four years, 
making sure that — even in the hardest of times during the pandemic — we lived within our 
means. This budget proposal continues that practice.

We look forward to the discussions over the next several months as we outline each initiative and 
impact of the proposed investments. 
Departmental Overview 
The Department of Public Safety was established to serve the people by providing, 
coordinating, and leading a responsive and comprehensive public safety system to protect their 
lives, rights, and properties. This broad mission is accomplished with 643 positions spread 
across 10 bureaus. The Bureaus are Administration, Capitol Police, Consolidated Emergency 
Communications, Emergency Medical Services, Fire Marshal's Ofﬁce, Gambling Control, 
Highway Safety, Maine Criminal Justice Academy, Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, and the 
Maine State Police. 
Administration — Public Safety 
I will begin today on Page A-576 with Administration — Public Safety Program. This Program 
is the Commissioner's Ofﬁce, and it oversees the activities and programs of the bureaus and 
ofﬁces, undertakes comprehensive planning, develops and implements procedures and practices 
to promote economy and coordination within the department and actively seeks cooperation 
between the department and all other law enforcement entities in the State. The ofﬁce houses the 
public information office and coordinates with the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services for information technology, ﬁnancial, and human resource services. 
The ﬁrst initiative provides funding for increases to statewide technology services and adjusts 
the baseline budget in the General Fund by $4,035 in both FY24 and FY25. With the increase in
