Testimony of Maine Public Health Association : 
LD 258: An Act Making Unified Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund and Other 
Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain Provisions of the Law Necessary 
to the Proper Operations of State Government for the Fiscal Years Ending June 30, 2023, June 30, 2024, 
and June 30, 2025 
 
Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs  
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services  
Wednesday, February 22, 2023  Good morning, Senators Rotundo and Baldacci , Representatives Sachs  and Meyer, and members of the Joint 
Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Health and Human Services. My name is Rebecca Boulos. I am a resident of South Portland and executive director of Maine Public Health Association. MPHA is providing testimony about porti ons of  LD 258: “ An Act Making Unified Appropriations and 
Allocations from the General Fund and Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and Changing Certain Provisions of the Law Necessary to the Proper Operations of State Government for the Fiscal Years Ending June 30, 2023, June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2025.”  
 
MPHA is the state’s oldest, largest, and most diverse association for public health professionals. We represent 
more than 700 individual members and 60 organizations across the state. The mission of MPHA is to improve and sustain the health and well -being of all people in Maine through health promotion, disease prevention, and 
the advancement of health equity. As a statewide nonprofit association, we a dvocate, act, and advise on critical 
public health challenges, aiming to improve the policies, systems, and environments that underlie health inequities – but which also have potential to improve health outcomes for all people in Maine. We are not tied to a national agenda, which means we are responsive to the needs of Maine’s communities, and we take that responsibility seriously. 
 
Fund for a Healthy Maine  
In 1998, Maine was one of 46 states to settle a lawsuit with the t obacco industry. Per the Tobacco Master 
Settlement Agreement  (MSA) , Maine receives annual payments from the tobacco industry to compensate 
taxpayers for public costs related to tobacco use. These payments have averaged $50 million annually and are schedule d to be received in perpetuity. Maine’s legisla ture at the time was forward thinking and established 
statute ( “the Fu nd for a Healthy Maine ”) that outlined how the money should be spent – with an explicit focus 
on tobacco use prevention and treatment . Recognizing that effective tobacco prevention and treatment policy 
includes improving other determinants of health, including addressing challenges associated with healthcare in rural areas, the legislature also included funding for school -based health centers, oral health , and other health 
programs.  
 
Over time, an d particularly starting in 2013, more of these funds have been used for Medicaid reimbursement. 
This has meant a steady decline for prevention programming, with consistently 70% of the revenue being 
allocated for Medicaid reimbursement and only 30% be ing used for prevention activities ; despite d ata that show 
it less expensive to prevent chronic diseas es than to treat  them. Indeed, 
resear ch conducted by the Trust for 
122 State Street, Augusta, ME 04330 • 207- 808-0487 • mainepublichealth.org  America’s Health  demonstrate s that the R eturn -On-Investment  for chronic disease prevention programs in 
Maine is $7.52 in economic output  and $5.60 in health care savings  for every $1.00 invested.  
 
As you can see from the  tables below , the Fund is facing a structural defi cit, such that the state has allocated 
more monies from the Fund than it will receive from the MSA  in future years. The MSA  is tied  to national sales 
of combustible cigarettes. As more people have switched to electronic cigar ettes, which were not included in the  
origina l settlement, sales of combustible cigarettes hav e declined ; thus, the state ’s revenue from the MSA is 
decreasing , and will con tinue to do so. In other words, the Fund’s budget  is no longer sustainable . 
 MPHA has a longstanding commitment to protecting the Fund for a Healthy Maine (
see our 2021 Historical 
Report here ) and advancing planful approaches to public health funding and programming in Maine . As such, 
we respectfully request  this legislature to actively pursue solutions to this structural deficit in the current 
biennium, while there are still just  enough resources available to fund the F und for a H ealthy M aine 
baseline and time to thoughtfully consider potential solutions .

  Public Health Nursing  
MPHA i s very supportive of the allocated funding for  Maine’s public health nursing workfor ce. We 
worked closely with Senator Brownie Car son in the 128
th legislature to pass LD 1108 , “An Act to Restore 
Public Health Nursing Services .” Ensuring there  are sufficient  funds to support  this essential sector of Maine ’s 
public hea lth workf orce should be a priorit y – particularly  given our state ’s rural geography and the closing of 
rural hospitals  and maternal and child health centers  across the stat e. 
 
In the words of Georges Benjamin, MD, FACP, Executive Director of the  American Public Health Association, 
“Public health nurses do what nobody else is doing. And what every community deserves. ” From the 
American Public Health Association’s Public Health Nursing Definition Document Task Force (2013): “ Public 
health nursing is the practice of promoting and protecting the health of populations using knowledge from 
122 State Street, Augusta, ME 04330 • 207- 808-0487 • mainepublichealth.org  nursing, social, and public health sciences. Public health nursing is a specialty practice within nursing and 
public health. It focuses on improving population health by emphasizing prevention and attending to multiple determinants of health ….While the discipline of nursing was founded on improving environmental conditions 
to facilitate health at the bedside, public hea lth nurses focus on improving population health in the environments 
where people live, work, learn, and play. ” 
 Public health nurses support the health of entire families, inclu ding new mothers and babies, as well as ol der 
adults and patients diagnosed with TB. Public health nurses e nsure their patients ’ medical needs are met, and 
that everyone in the home has what they need to be healthy, including food, heat, and social /emotional support. 
 Oral Health Care  
In the 130
th legislature, LD 1501  was included in  the budget ; this bill expanded  the Maine CDC ’s School Oral 
Health Program to all schools. Currently, t he School Oral Health P rogram (2022- 23) serves  about 220 schools 
with a budget of  approximately $239,000, using monies from the Fund for Healthy Maine , and $194,474 in 
State General Funds. The  proposed biennial  budget  keeps the funding at its  current baseline, which is 
insufficient to  enable full  expansion given that there are approximately 600 schools  in the state. The  fiscal note 
for LD 1501 had project ed increasing the State General Fund allocation to  $464,377 for FY2024 and $587,907 
for FY2025. Thus, we are asking for a 2- year  increase of $454,750 in the 2024- 25 biennial budget (the 
amount needed over the current year's baseline allocation) to ensure t he program funding reaches the 
level of funding needed for the full expansion by 2025. 
 Nationally, 13.2%  of youth ages 5-19 years have untreated tooth decay;  the percentage is doubled among adults 
aged 20- 44 years (25.9%) .
1 A recent (2019) systematic review confirmed that  low individual/household income 
is associated with more oral cancer, dental caries prevalence, any caries experience, tooth loss, and traumatic 
dental injuries. The review also confirm ed qualitatively that low -income is associated with periodontal disease  
and poor oral health- related quality of life.2 
 According to the National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center, “Schools are the intersec tion of 
public health programs, oral health care, and self -care. Schools therefore have a unique opportunity to enhance 
students’ health literacy, including oral health literacy.”
3 Currently, there are four components of the School 
Oral Health Program in Maine: education, fluoride, dental screenings, and dental sealants.4 Dental sealants are 
thin coatings to prevent tooth decay; they are one of the most effective ways to protect teeth. Once a sealant is 
applied, a tooth is protected against 80%  of cavities for 2 years, and 50% of cavities for up to 5 years.5 Children 
between the ages of 6 to 11 years without sealants have three times more first molar cavities than children who 
have sealants.4 Each tooth sealed saves more than $11 in treatment c osts.4 
 The School Oral Health Program fills a critical gap in the oral health care system  by ensuring that all kids can  
receive at least a screening and fluoride varnish, and assistance with follow up referrals as needed. Last  fall, 
about 1 in 4 children screened by the program were identified with active deca y; this proportion could be 
significantly higher in schools where the School Oral Health Program  has not been available as decay rates tend 
to improve once schools have had the services for a few years. Funding to expand the program, as intended, is 
essential for supporting the or al health need s of all children in Maine.  
 Tobacco Prevention and Control  
MPHA is  gratef ul the Governor’s biennial budget proposal provides “ full” funding for the state ’s tobacco  
prevention and control program at the U .S. Centers for D isease C ontrol and Prevention’ s recommended level of 
$15.9 million/year. Th ese funds support statewide and local efforts to prevent tobacco use , and provide 
intervention and treatment programming. The funding also supports data  collection  and enforcement efforts.  
  
 
122 State Street, Augusta, ME 04330 • 207- 808-0487 • mainepublichealth.org  Environmental Health  
We support funding for water testing, abat ing, and  mitigating identified contaminatio n, as well as the 
installation of filter treatment systems , and other necessary actions to ensure the provision of clean 
drinking water. We also support funding for  solid waste management  to help with PFAS management.  
 
According to data from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC), 56.7% of Maine 
households obtain their drinking water from a residential well ;6 the highest percentage of any state.7 Most 
of these residences are in rural areas, where residents are also less likely to have access to quality medical care, 
broadband internet, and other positive determinants of health. According to Maine CDC, 1 in 10 wells in Maine has too much arsenic, uranium, radon, or other harmful chemicals. Data fro m Maine’s public health laboratory 
show that nearly 20% (16.5%) of private wells tested exceed the 10ppb federal health standard for arsenic in drinking water.
8 In some Maine communities, more than 60% of wells exceed the arsenic standard, meaning 
approxi mately 130,000 Mainers lack safe drinking water.9 Based on state averages for age, that would include 
approximately 3,600 children under the age of 5 years. Arsenic contamination has been associated with cardiac disease
10,11,12,13 and depression14 in adults, and lower verbal IQ and poorer long- term memory in children.15 
 Radon gas exposure is another concern for private well owners. According to Maine CDC, one in three homes tested will show higher than normal levels of radon; and one in five wells will have radon concentrations higher than the recommended level. The website, City -Data.com, provides a map of radon zones in Maine
 based on data 
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Radon gas exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer among nonsmokers, and second only to tobacco use in all cases. Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S. In Maine, the lung cancer rate is 30% higher than the national average. Unfortunately, 75% of lung cancer cases in Maine are detected late and are not treatable. P ersons with lower 
income and those living in rural areas share a greater burden of lung cancer than persons with higher income or those living in urban areas.
16 For example:  
• People with family incomes of less than $12,500 have lung cancer incidence rates that are more than 1.7 times  the incidence rate of those with incomes $50,000 or higher.
17 
• People living in rural areas have 18–20% higher rates of lung cancer than people living in urban areas.11 
 
PFAS is another potential source of contamination for well water. According to the U.S. EPA, PFAS are found 
in air, soil, surface water, and groundwater (including drinking water); food and food packaging; commercial 
household products; and some living organisms (where PFAS have accumulated over time).18 PFAS do not 
break down and can accumulate over time. There is evidence from huma n and animal studies that PFAS 
exposure may reduce antibody responses to vaccines19,20 and infectious disease resistance,21 alter metabolism22 
and fertility,23 reduce fetal growth and increase the risk of being overweight or obese.24 A recent review of the 
research literature explored the relationship between PFAS exposure and children’s health. Six associations with health were identified: early puberty onset, thyroid and renal function, immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic measures, and neurodevelopmental/attention.
25 What is particularly challenging about these 
chemicals is both their widespread use and the public’s unawareness of their additive exposure and accumulation.  
 
Given the greater risk and burden of disease among vulnerable Mainers – incl uding persons with lower -income, 
those living in rural areas, and those with less access to health care, who are also likely to have later -stage 
disease diagnosis
26 – increasing available funding to treat contaminated wells is needed for reducing polluted 
drinking water and the associated health consequences for already high- risk Maine households. Clean drinking 
water is fundamental for good health, and we strongly support efforts to ensure safe drinking water for all people in Maine.  
 I would be happy to answer any questions. Thank you fo r your conside ration .
