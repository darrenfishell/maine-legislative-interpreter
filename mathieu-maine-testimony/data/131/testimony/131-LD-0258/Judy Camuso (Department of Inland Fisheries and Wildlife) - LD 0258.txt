Good morning Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs; Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, 
and members of the Joint Standing Committee on inland Fisheries and Wildlife. My name is 
Judy Camuso, and lam the Commissioner of the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. l 
am here today to testify in support ofthe biennial budget bill, LD 258. 
This budget advances the Governor's guiding belief that to build a stronger, more prosperous 
state where opportunity is available to all, then we must invest in the infrastructure that 
supports the people of Maine, our greatest asset. 
That is why this budget proposal strengthens the very things that Maine people rely on every 
day to succeed, building Ion the strong success ofthe currently enacted budget and the last 
legislative session to tackle Maine's greatest challenges. 
We have governed cautiously and in a fiscally prudent way over the past four years, making 
sure that — even in the hardest of times during the pandemic — we lived within our means. This 
budget proposal continues that practice. 
We look forward to the discussions over the next several months as we outline each initiative 
and impact of the proposed investments. 
The Department of inland Fisheries & Wildlife is the lead agency in Maine with the 
responsibility to preserve, protect and enhance the inland fisheries and wildlife resources of the 
State; to encourage the wise use of these resources; to ensure coordinated planning for the 
future use and preservation of these resources; and to provide for effective management of 
these resources.
