MAINE STATE AUDITOR" 
LD 258, An Act Making Uniﬁed Appropriations and Allocations from the General F and and 
Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government for the Fiscal Years Ending 
June 30, 2023, June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2025 
Senator Rotundo and Representative Sachs, Senator Nangle and Representative Stover and 
distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
and State and Local Government, my name is Matt Dmilap of Old Town, and I have the high honor 
and distinct privilege of serving as State Auditor. I am here to present several sections of the 
biennial budget and to answer any question about those sections as they pertain to the Office of 
the State Auditor. 
First, I believe some context is in order which I hope will assist the committees in their 
deliberations. The Ofﬁce of the State Auditor was formally established in law in 1907; While our 
duties have changed somewhat over the last 116 years, our core mission has not. The premise is 
simple; we examine and test transactions conducted by state agencies to reasonably assure that 
those programs are expending resources according to the criteria set forth in law. As a former 
policymaker, I note that it’s an activity that seldom attracts much attention, but in terms of our 
commitment to support the Work of state agencies in maintaining efﬁcient processes and in 
complying with legal guidelines attached to the use of Federal and state appropriations, allocations 
and allotments, the importance of the functions of this office cannot be over-emphasized. The 
Office is currently auditing 18 Federal programs totaling approximately 89% percent of the 
$5.7 billion in Federal ﬁnancial assistance expended by the State in ﬁscal year 2022. Our partners 
in state government in general and our fellow citizens in particular are Well-served by the expert 
and committed staff at the Ofﬁce of the State Auditor, and I am very proud to work with them. 
In concert with the Executive, we are pleased to offer you the opportunity to modestly enhance 
our effectiveness. The initiatives for the Office of the State Auditor begin on page A-125 of the 
budget document.

software licenses and renewal of 30 licenses, as well as technology costs for OIT personal services 
to develop servers to roll out software. This all other request is funded from Other Special
