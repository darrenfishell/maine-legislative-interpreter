Re: Testimony of the Maine Judicial Branch on LD 258, the Biennium Budget (MCILS) 
I am Amy Quinlan, the State Court Administrator, and I am testifying neither 
for nor against the portion of L.D. 258 that pertains to the budget for the 
Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services. I am testifying "neither for nor 
against" the proposed budget because it is not the role of the Iudiciary to tell 
the Legislature what policy to adopt to solve the problems that MCILS faces, 
but it is important for the Iudiciary to tell the Legislature the problems that 
the Iudiciary is facing because of the shortage of defense attorneys. 
The shortage of defense attorneys affects the Iudiciary in many ways: 
0 First, all of us care so very much that the constitutional rights of the 
people who come into the court system are protected as they face 
possible incarceration or the loss of their children. 
0 Second, our clerks are spending hours and hours trying to find lawyers 
in some cases. This takes them away from the workload they are 
already trying to manage under difficult circumstance and puts the 
courts even further behind in clearing cases. 
0 Third, our trial courts shift operations on a regular basis to 
accommodate the needs of attorneys strained by their case load and 
spread out through many counties. This means increased use of Zoom,
even when it is not otherwise effective. It means cases are continued, 
whether formally through motions or informally, because there is just 
too much to handle. 
We urge these committees to consider carefully the policy choices before you 
and to craft and fund the policy that you think will best protect the rights of 
Maine residents who come into the court system and will lay the foundation 
for a system that guarantees access justice now and into the foreseeable 
future.

From: Amy Quinlan, State Court Administrator 
Date: February 27, 2023 
Re: Testimony of the Maine Judicial Branch on LD 258, the Biennium Budget 
My name is Amy Quinlan; l am the State Court Administrator for the Maine Judicial 
Branch. I appreciate the opportunity to come before you today to discuss the Judicial Branch 
budget and the new initiatives. Over the past three years a great deal has been said about the 
impact of the pandemic on how the courts conduct business. The justice system has undergone 
drastic changes transitioning centuries old processes moored by constitutional protections and 
the right to due process. These processes are the backbone of our system and must be followed 
before any individual may be deprived of any life, liberty, or property interests. 
When the pandemic made it impossible for a time for the courts to bring people into the 
courthouses, we needed to develop new ways of doing business while meeting these 
constitutional and due process mandates. We did what all courts did nationwide: we introduced 
new technologies to allow for remote proceedings and the exchange of electronic information, 
and we altered operations to support these changes. You have heard a lot about the steps taken to 
protect the public during the pandemic and I won’t repeat them here. The bottom line is that we 
were successful in implementing unprecedented change in a very short period of time. 
We know that many of these new processes and technologies have been beneﬁcial by 
providing more access to the courts particularly in our rural areas, allowing attorneys to attend 
remote proceedings on behalf of litigants in other locations, and for people to attend court 
proceedings without having to go to a courthouse in certain case types. These technologies are 
here to stay because they beneﬁt the system as a whole and provide better access to justice. But 
these changes do not necessarily translate into more efﬁciencies for court staff. In fact, in many 
instances the opposite is true. The due process requirements that ensure a right to trial by an 
impartial jury and public access to many court proceedings, or the right to a court record from 
which to bring an appeal, or the right to confront and cross examine a Witness do not easily 
translate to remote proceedings, although the technology has improved since 2020. Many of the 
requests you will see relate to continuing those technology enhancements, additional resources to 
manage those technology solutions, and training to support a transitioning work force.
One thing we did not do in response to the pandemic was close the courts. To be clear, 
the state court system remained open during the pandemic. There was a period of about 15 
months where certain dockets, especially jury trials, were curtailed to comply with CDC 
recommendations concerning distancing and capacity. This led to a buildup of cases now 
referred to as the backlog that we are still trying to address. 
We have spent some time in recent months while developing our FY 2024/2025 budget 
requests trying to understand how we got to where we are and creative solutions for reducing the 
backlog. We have looked at over a decade’s worth of information including court ﬁling trends, 
how long it takes to resolve cases, and whether we are keeping up with demand. As it turns out, 
the Judicial Branch was struggling to keep up with our caseload even before the pandemic. 
Many of these trends began back in 2010 and have increased incrementally over time. For 
example: 
Criminal Cases 
0 Between 2010 to 2019, the time to resolve criminal cases signiﬁcantly increased 
despite a drop in ﬁlings for the same time period. 
0 Filings in our most serious criminal cases increased by +8.6% and the felony 
pending caseload leading up to the pandemic grew by +95%. 
0 Both trends continued through the pandemic, with average felony ﬁlings up 
+9.2% ﬁ'om 2010 and the pending felony caseload up +84.3%. 
0 Between 2010 and 2019, the Judicial Branch saw an overall increase in 
continuance rates across all cases (+21 .7%), but some of the most signiﬁcant 
increases were in criminal cases (+21 .9% overall, +19.3% in misdemeanor cases, 
and +41 . 1% in felony cases). 
Mental Health 
0 Between 2014 and 2019, there was a marked increases in mental health-related 
events in criminal cases, including motions requesting mental health exams 
(+25.8%), court ordered exams (+99.0%), and ﬁndings of incompetence to stand 
trial (+81.3%). These trends were even more pronounced in misdemeanor cases 
and have grown exponentially since the pandemic. While these events make upa 
relatively small portion of the criminal caseload, mental health issues add 
signiﬁcant complexity such that a small number of cases can havea 
disproportionate effect on the overall caseload. 
Protective Custody 
0 Protective Custody cases experienced explosive growth between 2010 and 2019, 
with ﬁlings nearly doubling (+93.2%). 
We explored how some of these changes correlate to new statutory requirements or rules changes 
and the advent of electronic discovery. The causes for these evolving caseload trends cannot be 
attributed to any one thing. The apparent reasons for delay are varied and systemwide. But one 
thing is clear: The pandemic was a tipping point that unmasked the reality that, even before the 
pandemic, the courts and judicial system were struggling to keep up with the demand. 
We have made some headway this past year (thanks, in part, to the added resources 
received though the last Supplemental Budget). I am pleased to report that the backlog is
decreasing in some case types. In those cases where pending caseloads continued to increase, 
growth has slowed over the past year. But many cases are still taking too long to resolve. The 
simple truth is that we are under resourced and have been for some time. We need more judges, 
clerks, marshals, technologists, process and training support, and more. Through the Chief and 
my statewide visits, focus groups and discussions, and review of our caseload data and case 
processing information, we have developed what we believe to be a comprehensive request to 
address the Branch’s critical resource needs. As before, our requests focus on resources to 
address the backlog and long-term stafﬁng needs. 
We are grateful to Governor Mills for including in her Recommended Biennium Budget 
59 positions for the Judicial Branch. That includes, among other things, 4 new judges, 24 clerks 
or clerk support staff, and 16 deputy marshals and court attendants. We recognize that is a very 
large number. Yet it is less than our original ask of 83 positions -- the need we identiﬁed through 
our months-long budget process. And it is far less than the need identiﬁed by the recent 
Weighted Caseload Study conducted by the National Center for State Courts (an independent, 
non-proﬁt organization focused on improving the administration of justice in state courts). Their 
study analyzed the need for additional judicial and clerk resources through a time study 
conducted in October and November of 2022. Their report identiﬁes an additional need of l0 
new judicial ofﬁcers and 54 clerk positions just to keep up with current ﬁlings. The study did 
not focus on reducing the backlog. 
We recognize that these numbers are overwhelming. We understand that sufﬁciently 
resourcing the justice system may need to be done in increments which is why we worked with 
the Governor ’s ofﬁce to adjust our original ask. We also know that you must do the difﬁcult 
work of considering many critical and deserving needs. And, the budget requests we present to 
you today are the result of thorough analysis and careful consideration to identify what resources 
the Judicial Branch must have to meet our mission of providing equal justice to all. 
Turning to our speciﬁc requests, they are as follows: 
Page A-478, #1: General Fund FY24 $135,624 / FY25 $143,098 
This ﬁrst initiative is for one Assistant Systems Administrator position. This position 
would provide technical support for the network and computing infrastructure used in the 
Judicial Branch, as well as technical user support for judges and staff. Responsibilities also 
include software updates for both servers and computers. Our technology staff is small. The 
increasing reliance on technology solutions is straining our ability to manage our technology 
infrastructure from our data centers, software licenses and conﬁgurations, equipment 
maintenance and upgrades, and security issues. Currently we have two positions that primarily 
focus on our infrastructtue which is insufﬁcient particularly as our reliance on technology grows. 
Moreover, there is very little overlap between the two infrastructure positions which leaves the 
Judicial Branch vulnerable should one of them become available. This new position would 
negate that risk by backing up these positions while adding capacity and support to those existing 
roles. C-A-36 
Page A-478, #2: General Fund Revenue FY25 l40,'739 
This next initiative establishes one Legal Process Specialist position for our criminal 
caseload. We currently have one position charged with overseeing all criminal processes for the 
Judicial Branch. This is insufﬁcient. By adding an additional position, We would be able to better 
assist the clerks and judges with developing alternative schedules to manage caseloads, analyze
\ 
caseloads, prepare public information documents and online training, assist the clerks in 
developing a plan for management of the shrinking roster of court appointed counsel and provide 
training statewide to bail commissioners and jail staff. C-A-37 
Page A-479, #1: General Fund FY24 $02,308 / FY25 $108,148 
Establishes one Form Development Specialist in FY24. Much of the information 
provided to the court and from the court is entered into official court forms. These forms are 
based on statute or court rule and are integral to court processes. Due to frequent changes in 
statute and rules, these forms need to be constantly reviewed and updated to accurately reﬂect 
those changes. Currently many positions contribute to form development in addition to other 
duties. But we are struggling to keep up with the demand without diminishing effectiveness in 
other key areas particularly as it relates to electronic forms which requires technical assistance. 
This position will create and maintain all electronic forms used in Odyssey. C-A-39 
Page A-479, #2: General Fund FY24 $360,956 / FY25 $471,978 
Establishes 3 Electronic Filing Specialist positions and one Electronic Filing Supervisor 
position in FY24 and one Electronic Filing Specialist position in FY24. These positions will 
help maintain our timing goals for ﬁled documents being available for public viewing. It has 
become clear that centralizing this function allows for a more consistent approach to ﬁle review 
while reducing work in otherwise busy clerks’ ofﬁces. These positions will review ﬁlings for 
compliance with requirements and would also provide phone support to electronic ﬁlers who 
need additional assistances. C-A-40 
Page A-479, #3: General Fund FY24 $239,801 / $25l,254 
Continues and makes permanent two Field Operations Specialist positions. The need for 
these positions was so great that we established limited term positions to begin this work last fall. 
These positions provide support to clerk’s ofﬁces in the form of resource development, training 
and added stafﬁng as needed. The work performed by clerks’ ofﬁces has become increasingly 
complex through statutory, rule, and process changes, new technology, and other factors. 
Turnover rates in our clerk’s ofﬁces since the beginning of the pandemic have run about 34% 
statewide with some of our bigger courthouses near or above 50%. Inadequate stafﬁng and lack 
of training are two primary causes for this strain. C-A-4l 
Page A-4'79, #4: General Fund FY24 $163,247 / FY25 $172,295 
Establishes 2 Service Center/Violations Bureau Assistant Clerk positions effective FY24 
and provides funding for related All Other costs for workstations, computers and other set up 
costs. The Service Center provides an array of services on behalf of the trial courts, including 
answering all incoming public calls for 8 superior & 15 district courts and fully resolve 79% of 
all inquiries and transferring the remaining questions to the appropriate court. In doing so, the 
Service Center efﬁciently provides the public contacting those regions with high quality public 
service by responding to public inquiries while freeing up court clerks to focus on pressing local 
needs. C-A-43 
Page A-479, #5: General Fund FY24 $50,000 / FY25 $50,000 
Provides funding for contracted cybersecurity services. Cybersecurity is becoming 
increasingly critical given the growing reliance on technology solutions. The Judicial Branch 
recently signed a one-time, one-year contract with Tyler Cybersecurity Solutions (formerly Sage, 
a Maine company) to analyze, plan, test, and develop action plans to address cybersecurity 
threats. The Judicial Branch anticipates the need for ongoing expertise in this area. C-A-44
Page A-479, #6: General Fund FY24 Sl35,62-4 / FY25 $l43,089 
Establishes one Odyssey Administrator position. This position will monitor and control 
the system users; monitor system alerts and develop solutions to keep the system functioning 
well; develop training materials; coordinate data base refreshes of non-production environments; 
engage with other agencies as data is exchanged and work through any issues. These tasks are 
currently being absorbed by other positions. It has become clear that a dedicated position is 
required to effectively manage these tasks as we implement the Odyssey system in additional 
courts statewide. If this position is not created, the Judicial Branch would need to contract with 
Tyler Technologies to manage these tasks which would be cost prohibitive. C-A-45 
Page A-480, #1: General Fund FY24 $50,000 
Provides one-time funding for Alternative Dispute Resolution Information System 
(ADRIS) software updates. This is the system used by Court Alternative Dispute Resolution 
Services (CADRES) to process payments, create schedules, and manage workﬂow. These 
critical changes will address security issues and the addition of mediation in consumer debt 
collection cases from last year’s legislative session. C-A-46 
Page A-480, #2: General Fund FY24 $791,390 / FY25 $794,306 
Continues 3 limited-period Intermittent project Referee positions to address the backlog 
of non-jury, family, and civil cases, caused by the pandemic by providing determinations on 
referred cases when agreed to by the parties. The goal of this program is to add capacity to 
dispose of cases without using sitting judges or other Judicial Branch personnel. The All Other 
costs related to these positions include transcription services, minor equipment, and technology 
costs related to licenses and video remote hosting services. 
C-A-47 
Page A—480, #3: Other Special Revenue FY24 $('788.99'7) / FY25 ($793,729) 
This initiative is a house-cleaning item and reduces our funding to align with projected 
available resources for our Other Special Revenue Accounts. C-A-5l 
Page A-480, #4: General Fund FY24 $114,620 /' 
FY25 $114,620 
Provides funding for an increase in active retired justices ‘ and judges‘ per diem rates from 
$3 50 to $500 per day and from $200 to $300 per half day. At this rate the active retired judges 
are paid $43.75 to $50.00 per hour, which is lower than court appointed attorneys, guardian ad 
litems and most other service providers. Language for this change is reflected in PART LLL.

Transfers one Manager of Court Alternative Dispute Resolution Services (CADRES) 
position and reallocates the cost from 65% Other Special Revenue Funds and 35% General Fund 
to 100% General Fund within the same program. The reallocation of this position is necessary 
for the continued ability to fund this critical role. The services provided by the CADRES 
program have increased, but fees are sometimes waived when parties are not able to afford the 
cost. Since fees are waived for parties who cannot afford to pay, increasing fees is unlikely to 
support the expenses in this account. This leaves the program susceptible to revenue shortfall 
and projections show that the account will not be able to sustain the continued cost of this 
position. Existing staff do not have the ability to absorb the workload. C-A-1
Page A-480, #6: General Fund FY24 GF $250,000 / FY25 CF $250,000 
Provides one-time funding for increased Maine Judicial Information System (MEJIS) 
support costs. We retain contractors to maintain the system software that is an Apple language 
and not commonly used. The contractor rates have increased to $150/hr from $100/hr that was 
set 10 years ago. C-A-4 
Page A-481, #1: General Fund FY24 $50,000 / FY25 $50,000

Continues and makes permanent one Accounting Technician position and one Collections 
Coordinator position, and one Court Fine Screener position. These positions support revenue 
collection throughout the state, from assisting clerks with processing payment issues, tax and 
lottery offset, revenue recording, reconciliations, research death records, coordinating collections 
efforts, and providing guidance and assistance to individuals who have failed to pay ﬁnes in 
accordance with court orders. These positions were established pursuant to 4 MRS § 20 and are

Page A-481, #7: General Fund FY24 $520,000 / FY25 $520,000 
Provides funding for operational costs for the York Judicial Center. These costs include 
snow removal, janitorial, utilities and landscaping costs and reﬂect savings from closing 
Springvale and Biddeford District Courts and turning them over to DAF S for disposition; leaving 
Alfred Superior Court where most costs were paid by the county; and maintaining York District 
Court for ﬁle and furniture storage on a temporary basis. C-A-11 
Page A-482, #1: General Fund FY24 $275,000 / FY25 $275,000 
Provides funding for mediation service rate increases in the Court Alternative Dispute 
Resolution Services Account (CADRES). Mediation for dispute resolution is an effective way 
to divert and resolve certain types of cases and is mandated in certain cases. This initiative 
provides funding to increase Family mediation rates by $35 per session to a rate of $125 per
session and small claims mediation rates by $30 per session to $100 per session. These rates are 
per session and not hourly. Average session last 2.5 hours. Increasing fees in the past has 
resulted in more waiving of fees as more parties cannot afford the cost. Therefore, increasing 
fees is not a viable solution to support any increases. Not supporting the program will result ina 
judge hearing more cases. C-A-12 
Page A-482, #2: General Fund FY24 $290,000 / FY25 $290,000

utilities, snow removal, janitorial, and landscaping costs. 
Page A-482, #3: Other Special Revenue FY24 $500,000 / FY25 $500,000 
Provides funding for increased capital improvement costs. This increase provides a total 
of $800,000 in statewide capital improvement costs for all facilities. The Judicial Branch is 
currently authorized up to $300,000 per ﬁscal year of fee revenue collected to support capital 
expenditures. This funding cap has not been increased since it was established in Public Law 
2009, Chapter 213, Part QQ section 2. That is no longer sufﬁcient. For example, several of our 
HVAC units are at end of life or beyond. In 2023, it will cost $750,000 to replace one HVAC 
system in West Bath. Language in PART KKK has been updated. C-A-15

(including this one) to manage all Judicial Branch facilities statewide. This position was created 
to assist with providing project management oversight of the construction of the York Judicial 
Center and would continue to manage facilities at that location. The position will be 
permanently assigned to the York Judicial Center and funded by IV-D Other Special Revenue.

General Fund and 5% Federal Expenditures Fund within the same program. These positions have 
historically been funded by the federal Victims of Crime Assistance grant. In prior years we 
received a speciﬁed portion of the grant funds available, but future grants will be moving toa 
competitive bid process. This process change means that we could receive less grant ‘funding or 
none at all. The uncertainty of funding and necessity of these positions to complete statutorily 
required program functions means that to continue to conﬁdently provide services we will need 
to fund these positions (at least partially) through the General Fund. Structure allows us to to 
apply any amount of Fed funds received for the positions, should it be awarded. These positions 
assist the Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Director and supervise the efforts of the 
CASA volunteers assisting children subject to abuse and neglect. The use of volunteers reduces

Establishes 4 court attendant positions and 2 deputy marshal positions in FY24 and 
another 3 deputy marshal positions in FY25. The court attendant positions act as jury officers 
and control room attendants and are not law enforcement officers. By handling some of the tasks 
where law enforcement training is not necessary, these positions help to free the deputy marshals 
to focus on tasks where law enforcement training is essential, such as at entry screening. These 
positions were ﬁrst established in the last Supplemental Budget to creatively address the 
increased need for law enforcement personnel. By contrast, the deputy marshal positions are 
sworn law enforcement officers and provide critical courtroom security and entry screening. 
COVID-19 has underscored the need for these positions and the Way we meet our security needs 
has dramatically changed over the last 3-4 years. In prior years, we were able to supplement our 
security needs by using contractual positions. That is no longer possible. In recent years the 
ability to obtain contractual assistance to supplement the Work of our full-time law enforcement 
officers has all but disappeared. At times, we have had to close courthouses to the public to 
divert personnel to provide security in priority dockets. The lack of resources also inhibits our
ability to schedule jury trials because they require the highest level of security staffing. And yet, 
exposing cases to trial is the key to reducing the backlog and keeping up with the current 
caseload. C-A-25

Establishes 4 Assistant Clerk positions in FY24 and 2 Assistant Clerk positions in FY25. 
Assistant clerks docket, process, and ﬁle matters before the court. They schedule pre-trial 
activities, trials, motions, and other proceedings. They manage trailing dockets and trial lists; 
process ﬁnes, fees, and other funds coming into the courts and maintain accounts as necessary. 
The work closely with judges/justices, attorneys, members of the public and state, local, county, 
and federal agencies concerning matters before the court. Staff are now tasked with an 
increasing number of duties, both regulatory and technological in nature. Frequent statutory and 
rule changes require new processes to be developed and incorporated into daily operations. 
These tasks are often time sensitive, including bail and arrest warrants, protection orders, and 
motions for counsel. All of this must be accomplished While responding to attorney inquiries and 
questions from the public who need help accessing the court. We are seeing high levels of stress 
with existing staff, heavy overtime just to try to keep up with current demand, employee burnout, 
and large turnover rates particularly since the beginning of the pandemic. Experienced staff are 
diverted from other duties to assist new employees as they onboard — typically a several months’ 
long process. C-A-26

Establishes 3 Courtroom Technology Assistant positions in FY24 and 2 Courtroom 
Teclmology Assistant positions in FY25. These positions set up the recording devices and handle 
the recording of court proceedings which must be preserved for future reference and in case of 
appeal. As more sophisticated technology solutions are integrated into the courtroom process, we 
need more positions focused on managing the equipment, working with internal staff, litigants, 
and the public to access the technology, and troubleshoot technical issues in real time. C-A-27

Establishes one Mediator Coordinator position in FY25. This position would assist the 
director of the Court Alternative Dispute Resolution Service program (CADRES) with 
recruiting, retaining, and scheduling of mediators. During the pandemic, CADRES losta 
signiﬁcant number of rostered mediators. In addition, there are fewer mediators who are willing 
to travel to courthouses when compensation is lower than that offered by other state entities.F 
While the Director has been able to maintain mediation services in virtually all instances, it is 
increasingly difﬁcult to do so. This position would also be available to offer mediation to 
supplement the independent contractors. C-A-32

Establishes one Business Analyst Technology Trainer position and one Court Operations 
Trainer position. Training is one of the most critical and understaffed needs in the Judicial 
Branch. The lack of resources has created ripple effects branch wide contributing to high rates of 
turnover. As we incorporate more technology to modernize our processes, an expanded training 
team is needed to support our transitioning workforce. Our current staff is unable to handle all 
the training needs that have increased with the inﬂux of technology solutions and the high rates 
of turnover during the pandemic and due to retirements. C-A-34

LANGUAGE 
PART JJJ Page 46 Judges and Justice Salary Adjustment 
This language provides for an additional 4.5% increase in ﬁscal year 2024 in addition to 
the cost-of-living adjustment of 3% maximum in each ﬁscal year of the biemuum. 
Maine’s judges are currently the lowest paid judges (51st ) in the nation when salaries are 
adjusted for the cost of living. Our initial request to the Governor drew upon the methodology 
used by the last Compensation Commission and sought a 9% increase in addition to the statutory 
3% COLA. This would raise the salaries to $158,556 in FY 2024 and $163,313 in FY 2025, 
bringing them closer to the rates paid by their peers in the New England region. In addition to 
seeking fair compensation for our judges, the increase would help to remedy the salary 
compression we are experiencing across the branch. We still think this is appropriate. 
The language included in the biennium budget decreased our request but still provides for 
an additional 4.5% increase in ﬁscal year 2024 in addition to the cost-of-living adjustment of 3% 
maximum in each ﬁscal year of the biennium. We are grateful to Governor Mills for 
recommending this much needed increase. The added funding would raise the salaries for Maine 
trial judges from $145,642 to $156,565 effective July 1, 2023, and $ 161,262 in FY 2024. Based 
on recently release ﬁgures from NCSC, that increase would maintain Maine’s standing at 51st 
lowest in the nation and far below our sister states New Hampshire ($168,761) and Vermont 
($175,654) FY23 rates, but at least it will assist us in keeping pace with the increase in cost of 
living. 
PART KKK Page 46 
This section updates 4 MRSA section 28 that provides a formula for capital expenditures based 
on fees.

This language updates the statute concerning active retired judge pay discussed earlier. 
PART MMM Page 47 
The cost of the three courthouse projects (York, Oxford, and Waldo Counties) have come in 
under budget and funds are available for additional facility projects. This language extends the 
existing authority to also include purchasing property in Lewiston, Augusta, and Skowhegan for 
future expansion. We expect the total cost of all three to be about $1.5 million. All three 
locations have property available that is adjacent to our courthouse. 
Additional Items: 
Change Package: General Fund FY24 $403,551 / FY25 $396,881 
We understand that you will be receiving a change package from the Governor which will 
include 4 new Judges (1 Superior Court Associate Justice/ 3 District Court Associate Judges), 4 
Assistant Clerk Positions, and 4 Deputy Marshals. The need for these positions is outlined above 
and supported by the Weighted Caseload Study. We need more positions just to keep up with the 
current caseload demand. We are grateful to the Governor for recognizing the need. But I want 
to be clear that these new positions alone will not address the backlog for the next few years to 
come. NCSC identiﬁed a need of 10 additional judges to meet current need.
Rate increases for Guardians ad Litem 
Finally, I would like to address extending into FY24 and FY25 the rate increases for the 
Guardians ad Litem (GALs) gained through the Supplemental Budget. It is unclear whether this 
increase will be included in the Governor ’s Change Package. Based on the monetary transfers 
authorized in the Supplemental Budget, the Judicial Branch increased the rate paid to GALs to 
$150/hr., up from $80/hr. The Judicial Branch authorized this increase after conﬁrming that 
MCILS increased its rates for attorney compensation to the same amount as of the same date. It 
is unclear whether funds to continue the GAL rate increase into FY 24 and FY25 will be 
included in the change package, but we need to maintain the rate of $150 per hour to maintain 
the stability of the GAL program. We anticipate that the cost of keeping the $150/hr. rate paid to 
GALs will be an additional $3,402,900.00 per year for the Judicial Branch. We are asking that 
you appropriate funds to allow us to meet this cost increase. 
By statute, both parents and children involved in child protection cases are entitled to legal 
representation. Parents are entitled to a court-appointed attorney, and children are entitled toa 
guardian ad litem. 22 MRSA § 4005. All GALs paid to do child protective work must be 
attorneys. Me Rule GAL 2(a)(2). The Judicial Branch believes that maintaining equal pay 
among the practitioners appointed to a child protection case is critical to maintaining a pool of 
attorneys to serve as advocates for the parents and GALs for the children. Indeed, 
Administrative Order JB-05-5 requires it. The Judicial Branch believes that paying GALs less 
than their MCILS counterparts will result in a shortage of GALs and hobble the ability of the 
courts to handle the increasing, and increasingly complex, docket of protective custody cases. 
Many of the GALs credentialed to accept appointments in child protection cases also accept 
appointments to represent parents. The Judicial Branch fears that this disparate treatment among 
practitioners appointed in the same case will be a catalyst for resignations from the GAL roster. 
While an increase in the rate for parent attorneys may resolve the immediate need for parent 
representation, resignations from the GAL roster is a collateral consequence that cannot be 
ignored. The Judicial Branch cannot endorse a system that treats the Work of GALs representing 
the best interest of children in child protection cases as less valuable than the work of attorneys 
representing parents in these matters.
