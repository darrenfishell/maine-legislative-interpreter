-. 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and other esteemed members of the 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee- 
My name is Bob Jean from Rockland. l 
am a retired elementary teacher with 38 
years of service in Maine Public Schools. I am also the President of Maine 
Education Associati0n- Retired, an organization that represents well over 5,000 
members statewide.~ 
l’m here to testify neither for nor against the Governor's proposed change 
package to LD 258 as it relates to part HHHHH of the proposal. That part 
proposes a one-time ad hoc COLA of 3% for retirees. We truly appreciate this, 
however, it does not go far enough in addressing the real problem. The 3% cap 
on our COLA, which only applies to part of our pensions, is the real culprit. Until 
we ﬁnd a way to remove the cap, even if it‘s in incremental steps, our retirees will 
continue to fall behind as their pensions continue to lose value each year. it's 
difficult playing from behind all the time. It's demoralizing. 
So, yes, we appreciate the Governor's proposal but we can’t depend on one-time 
ﬁxes. We know those can't be guaranteed from year to year. Retired educators 
are looking fowvard to the day that work begins on dealing with the unfair COLA 
cap. 
Thank you for your time and thank you for your sen/ice to the citizens of Maine! 
Bob Jean
