Dear Maine Legislators I am writing this on my own time not work time to inform you of the urgent need 
to increase funding to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.  
In the last 3 years at the Dry Mills State Fish Hatchery in Gray Maine we have had significant turn over 
and were short handed for an extended period of time.  
The Most difficult aspect of this is training employees just to have them leave for better pay elsewhere! 
Retention is at an all time low and recruitment is very difficult  at this time. I realize this is an issue all 
across Maine both private and public however it is especially difficult when you are dealing with raising 
and stocking live fish for the public.  
Prime examples of us loosing good people is Jamie Brey and Greg B ell two supervisors. Jamie left to 
work for DOT and Greg is just leaving because he is tired of fighting with the state for more pay for him 
and his employees. I personally would leave also however I am only two and a half years away from 
retirement after having worked for Inland Fisheries and Wildlife for almost 35 years now.  
During the Pandemic a couple years ago out of four employees here at the Dry Mills Hatchery only 2 
remained for almost two Months myself and my supervisor Greg Bell thatâ€™s just to har d on workers over 
50 years old.  
I feel the only way to retain our work force is to close the pay gap between state employees and other 
states pay along with private sector. Thank you to all Legislators for listening to my testimony.  
Sincerely yours  
Mike An drews
