Senator Rotondo and Representative Sachs and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs, my name is Laura Blaisdell, 
I am practicing pediatrician and the current president of the Maine Chapter of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics. 
I am writing to express great concern regarding the lack of investment in the 
foundational challenges of Maine’s child care system in the Governors Change 
package to LD 258. 
 
The tax credit for families proposed in LD 258 are not the same as child tax 
credits.  The tax credit proposes a very small reimbursement in comparison to 
child care costs. Additionally, many lower income, families are excluded from the 
the proposed tax credit. The number of families in Maine, that would be eligible 
to receive the double child and dependent care tax credit are representated in only 
9% child care programs that are rated at the highest level on the Quality Rating 
and Improvements Scale.  
In my work with families I seen time and again that families need access to 
afforable quality child care.  An increase in child care wages is necessary to 
increase availability across the stage. We also need to expand subsidy and Head 
Start eligibility to reduce the cost burden on families. 
Our children are our future and we know that investing in them has an 
immeasurable but certainly mulit-fold return on investment. I stand here as a 
voice to the thousands of children in Maine who need quality child care systems 
to grow and thrive.  Please consisder a change package that includes more robust 
funding for our child care system including increased wages and expanded 
subsidies. 
Respectfully, 
Dr. Laura Blaisdell MD/MPH, FAAP
President, Maine Chapter AAP
