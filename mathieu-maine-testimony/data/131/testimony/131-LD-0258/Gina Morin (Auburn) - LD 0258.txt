Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and 
honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial
Affairs and the Joint Select Committee on Housing: my name is Gina Morin and I live
in Auburn. I am writing to ask you to invest in affordable housing for all Mainers.
I have entirely too much familiarity with Maine’s lack of affordable housing. In 2016,
I was forced out of my home and I lived in my car for ten days. I struggled to eat and 
stay warm. I had to go to my storage unit just to heat water for ramen noodles. I used 
a quarter of a tank of gas just to try to keep warm at night. After that, I rented a motel 
room where I lived for the next four and a half years. I was lucky I had just enough 
resources to rent that room, but I was stuck there–keeping that small bit of roof over 
my head made it nearly impossible to pay for a deposit on a real apartment, and rents 
were going up all the time. 
I finally found a good, affordable apartment through dumb luck. My apartment has changed 
my life. I’m actually living again, not just surviving, and I’m so grateful. I’ve been able to help 
others who needed a safe place to stay while getting back on their feet. People like me 
should not be living in motels. We need safe, affordable housing. Please make this 
investment now, so future Mainers will be able to thrive.
