 “An Act Making Unified Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund 
and Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and Changing 
Certain Provisions of the Law Necessary to the Proper Operations of State 
Government”  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
 
Public Hearing Date: May 17, 2023 
Testimony in Support of LD 258 
 
Chair Rotundo, Chair Sachs, and Honorable Members of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
Committee, my name is Maeghan Maloney, I am the District Attorney for Kennebec and Somerset 
Counties and the President of the Maine Prosecutors Association. I am here today in Support of LD 258, 
Part A, Section 1, Line 0409 which establishes 3 limited-period Assistant District Attorney positions for 
the STOP Violence against Women grant through June 14, 2025. 
Thankfully, this is a simple one. This initiative requires no money from the State of Maine. These 
three positions are exclusively funded by money from the federal government. Specifically, the federal 
STOP Violence against Women grant provides the money for these three positions. Therefore, this 
request is to allow the three limited-period positions to continue through June 14, 2025. If it is possible 
to have them continue longer, that would keep us from having to return to renew this request in two 
years. 
In case some background on these positions is helpful, I will provide that here. Every year I 
personally apply for a federal STOP grant. In the past, this grant covered 4 prosecutors who handled 
sexual assault and domestic violence cases in the counties of York, Androscoggin, Oxford, Franklin, 
Kennebec, Somerset, Penobscot, and Piscataquis. Unfortunately, the amount money available was 
reduced this year and now Penobscot and Piscataquis no longer receives this funding. This leaves three 
federal STOP grant prosecutors. The money will be further reduced this year and the Attorney General’s 
Office predicts the money will only cover two STOP grant prosecutors by the end of the year. 
Regardless, at this moment, there are three Stop prosecutors which is the reason for the need for three 
limited period positions. 
 
Thank you for your consideration,
