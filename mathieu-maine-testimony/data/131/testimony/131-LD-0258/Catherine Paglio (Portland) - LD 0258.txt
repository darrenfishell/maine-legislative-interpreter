To whom it may concern,  
My name is Catherine Paglio and I am a Childcare Licensing Specialist in the Office of Child and Family 
Services. I am currently in my tenth year working for the state . I truly do love my job and work with 
wonderful co -workers and childcare providers.  
I am  writing this letter on my own time to support the need to fully fund our departments, including 
closing the pay gap and improving wages.  
My husband and I live in a small home in Portland, my husband is partially retired and our cost to live in 
this small home has increased in the past year and our wages are making it more difficult to make ends 
meet. I would like to list a few examples : below you will see  our bills from January 2022  compared to 
January 2023  
                                               January 2022                       January 2023  
 
House payment                   $ 1589.00                       $ 1624.00 -increase due to rise in city taxes  
CMP electricity                     $102.28                          $300.00 - 
Spectrum/tv/internet          $123.00                         $143.00  
Groceries -weekly                 $60.00 -$70.00             $110.00 (approx.)  
Gas-weekly                            $20.00 (full tank)         $35.00 ( full tank)  
And I am reimbursed for my mileage -which doe s not really cover the gas I use weekly to complete 
childcare inspections from Portland to Lyman and several towns in between.  
Those bills listed above are the bills that have increased the most since January 2022, luckily we have no 
credit card debt but w e do have two car payments, car insurance, propane, payment towards IRA -
retirement, water , even the man who plows our driveway went up and addition $10.00 each time in 
needs to plow,  and not to mention unexpected expen ses-just this past year we had to repl ace out hot 
water tank, our gas stove, outdoor fencing and expensive repairs to our garage door. We keep our heat 
on our heat pumps low, we keep as many lights as we can off, we watch sales at all the grocery stores 
and closely watch gas prices. My paychec k has spread about as far as it can. Please support the need to 
fully fund all departments, and close the pay gap, improving wages.  
Thank you for taking the time to read my letter of support.
