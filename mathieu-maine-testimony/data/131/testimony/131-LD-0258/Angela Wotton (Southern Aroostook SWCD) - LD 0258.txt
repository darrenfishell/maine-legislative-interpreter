Maine's 16 Soil and Water Conservation Districts have consistently provided "more 
bang for the buck," as demonstrated in the summaries and return on investment 
dollars highlighted in annual reports to the legislature. In addition to the annual 
payment through Maine DACF, these investment dollars come from municipal or 
country contributions, grant funding, and volunteer time. Districts last received a 
funding increase in 2015 when annual funding was increased to $25,000 per District, 
or $400,000 total. With the 2015 funding increase, Districts have been able to add 
positions, provide more public educational opportunities, and taken on more 
programming, among other things. In Southern Aroostook, funding for general 
technical assistance continues to be limited as focus has shifted within federal 
programs to focusing on program participation through implementation of practices. 
Additional funding for the Southern Aroostook SWCD in particular would allow for 
needed one-on-one technical assistance to those landowners who aren't served 
through federal agencies like NRCS, as well as allow the SASWCD to pursue a wider
range of on-the-ground projects that involve practice designs. Remaining relevant 
with landowners is vital as we navigate shifts in weather patterns, adapt to new and 
recurring pest and disease pressures, and prioritize building soil health and resiliency 
to maintain our rural life and community. Additional funding within the new budget 
would be utilized with these priorities in mind and SASWCD respectfully requests the
committee to look at the impact of SWCD's as a whole in Maine and recognize the 
value of the education and work that has been done to improve our land and water.
