Good afternoon, Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Appropriations and Financial Affairs, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members ofthe 
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is Laura Harper, and l am a Senior 
Associate at Moose Ridge Associates. l am here today to present testimony on behalf of the Maine Long- 
Term Care Ombudsman Program. 
The Maine Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program provides advocacy services for residents in nursing 
homes, assisted housing (residential care and assisted living) and for recipients of home care services. 
Additionally, the program provides assistance to patients in hospitals who encounter barriers in 
accessing the long-term services and supports they need when they are ready to be discharged.

Home-Based Care (section 63) Services: An Essential Program for Older and Disabled Adults Who 
Want to Remain at Home 
The Ombudsman Program is pleased to support funding that sustains the expansion of the Home-Based 
Care (HBC) program (Section 63) that was approved in last year's Supplemental budget. This state 
funded program provides home care services for older and disabled adults who are ineligible for 
MaineCare and lack sufficient financial resources to pay for in-home care services. HBC provides services 
including personal care, adult day services, Physical and Occupational skilled therapies and respite 
services. The program offers a range of support from a few hours a week of care to providing nursing 
home level of care at home. It is an essential program that can help prevent or delay the need for care in 
a long-term care home. Additionally, the provision of these services provides much needed support to 
family caregivers. 
Time and time again, we have seen the great value of the Home~Based Care Program. For example, the 
husband of a woman in her 80's with advanced dementia requested our assistance. His wife required 
constant supervision. He was feeling overwhelmed with her care. His wife had been on the waitlist for 
the HBC program for eight months. We made an inquiry about her spot on the waitlist and were tolda 
funded spot was opening up for her. She was reassessed for services and was able to receive the care 
and support she needed. This made the difference in keeping her at home, avoiding an admission toa 
long-term care home. 
Initiative: Provides one-time funding for a contracted consultant to assist personal care agencies with 
licensing, training and quality standard requirements identified as a result of Resolve 2021, chapter 117.

Personal Care Agency Management and Quality Standards will be improved with Consulting Support 
We support this initiative that would assist Personal Care Agencies with licensing, training and quality 
standards. in our experience, there is a great need for this support to assure that these agencies are well
prepared to meet their obligations both to their employees as well as to the home care recipients they 
serve. Personal Care Agencies (PCA) provide non-medical services to individuals in their homes, they are 
registered with the Division of Licensing and Certification (DLC). PCA services include, but are not limited 
to activities of daily living, household tasks and medication reminders. Older adults and adults with 
disabilities rely on PCA services to remain independent in the community. They are an integral part of 
long-term services and supports in Maine. Providing a consultant for PCA agencies to assist with 
licensing, training and quality standards of service will improve their ability to maintain staffing and 
provide care. The success of PCA agencies directly impacts access to and quality of home care services 
for consumers.

in improving health outcomes and in reducing social isolation for homebound older adults and those 
receiving Home Based Care, Section 63 services. Recipients may lack social support, have physical 
disabilities and suffer from economic hardship. The interaction with volunteers who deliver the meals 
can be beneficial to recipients as well as the benefit of providing nutritious meals.

Affordable Assisted Living is an Important Model of Care 
The Ombudsman Program is pleased to support a per diem rate increase for Maine's seven affordable 
assisted living programs. These tax credit projects serve low-income older adults and adults with 
disabilities and are located in the following areas: Sanford, Portland, Saco, Camden, Augusta, Bangor 
and Millinocket. Each resident has their own apartment with access to support services as needed. 
These services include meals, personal care, medication administration, homemaker services and 
emergency response system. Over 200 residents live in the seven projects. Our experience with 
residents is that they are very satisfied with the quality of life and care the projects provide. This budget 
initiative that would provide a greatly needed per diem rate increase is the result of the program and 
financial review ofthe affordable assisted living projects recently conducted by Guidehouse lnc. for the 
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Aging and Disability Services. This comprehensive 
review will be very important in providing information that will guide the sustainability of the projects 
that serve as a critical part of the long-term services and supports continuum.

Home Care Programs that Support Older and Disabled Adults to Live independently in the Community 
The Ombudsman Program supports cost of living increases for home care programing including: Section
19, 18, 12 and 20. Section 19 Home and Community Benefits for the Elderly and Adults with Disabilities 
provides home care services for those that are nursing home level of care and vvant to stay in their own 
home. Section 18 Home and Community-Based Services for Adults with Brain injury provides services to 
qualifying individuals who have sustained an acquired brain injury. Section 12 Consumer Directed 
Attendant Services allows home care consumers with physical disabilities to consumer direct their own 
care. Section 20 Home and Community based services for Adults with Other Related Conditions allows 
consumers with cerebral palsy or other related conditions who are institutional level of care to choose 
to live in the community with support. These programs prevent adults with disabilities from 
inappropriate institutionalization and give those in institutions the ability to move back into the 
community. increased funding is necessary to ensure timely access to services, prevent informal 
caregiver burnout and make sure services are of the highest quality.

Maine Legal Services for the Elderly: An Extremely Effective Organization 
We are pleased to support this initiative that requires increasing the staffing capacity at Maine Legal 
Services for the Elderly (LSE) with one full-time staff attorney and a part-time helpline attorney. 
Increasing the staffing capacity of LSE is identified as a top priority recommendation in the Maine Elder 
Justice Roadmap. With additional staffing, it would allow LSE greater capacity to represent victims of 
abuse as well as other older persons who need legal assistance. There is a critical need for statewide 
access to legal services for low-income older persons. This non-profit legal services organization is
extremely effective in addressing a range of issues on behalf of the individual's they serve. The 
Ombudsman Program often works collaboratively with LSE on issues impacting the older and disabled 
adults we serve who need long-term services and supports. In fact, they are a critical partner in the 
advocacy work we do. 
The following are examples of the effectiveness of LSE: 
LTCOP was contacted by a home care consumer who wanted to appeal her reduction in home care 
services, she was reduced from 64 hours a week to 29 hours a week. LTCOP filed an appeal and madea 
referral to LSE, the assigned LSE lawyer and regional ombudsman investigated and found consumer had 
a significant health decline and loss of informal support since the assessment. The LSE lawyer advocated 
that the department reassess in lieu of an appeal, the department agreed, and the consumer was 
reassessed and restored to her previous hours. 
LTCOP was contacted by the family of a medically complex home care consumer. The consumer was at 
cap for how many hours she could receive under the program she was on. The family was facing burn 
out and requested assistance to go over program cap. LTCOP made a referral to LSE, the assigned lawyer 
made an ADA reasonable accommodation request to go over program cap. The ADA was approved, and 
the family was able to get the additional home care hours they needed for the consumer to remain at 
home.

as well as their family members, need an identified community resource for information about these 
services. ADRCs provide information about the options for services, caregiver support programs,
caregiver training, respite, and benefits programs. They are an important resource to help older and 
disabled adults and their family members in accessing the information and services they need.
