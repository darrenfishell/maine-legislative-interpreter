PART
YYY
SUMMARY
This
Part
revises
income
tax
law
to
increase
the
base
amount
of
the
Child
Care
Credit
(tax
credit
for
child
care
expenses)
from
25%
to
50%;
and
removes
references
to
an
outdated
applicable
percentage.
This
tax
credit
is
doubled
when
families
access
child
care
programs
rated
at
the
top
of
the
Maine
Quality
Rating
and
Improvement
Scale.
In
Maine
only
around
9%
of
child
care
programs
are
rated
at
the
highest
quality
which
means
the
majority
of
families
don’t
have
access
to
the
double
tax
credit.
While
we
appreciate
the
intention
of
this

initiative
to
reduce
the
burden
of
child
care
costs,
this
credit
is
not
available
to
Maine’s
lower
income
families.
This
is
also
a
small
credit
in
comparison
to
what
families
pay
for
child
care
costs.

Instead
we
would
ask
you
to
consider
investing
in
more
long
term,
sustainable
fixes
to
promote
high
quality,
affordable
child
care
in
Maine.
Investing
in
increases
to
the
child
tax
credit
which
benefits
all
Maine
families
with
children
would
have
a
greater
impact
in
tax
policy
for
families.
Investing
in
the
foundational
fixes
of
child
care
are
also
necessary
to
increase
access
and
affordability.
Low
wages
drive
child
care
educators
out
of
the
workforce.
While
the
child
care
workforce
declined
over
the
pandemic
and
has
yet
to
recover,
turnover
and
recruitment
in
the
field
have
been
a
decades
long
problem.

There
are
220
fewer
programs
in
Maine
than
in
2020
and
while
efforts
have
been
made
to
build
back
child
care
capacity,
enrollment
in
child
care
programs
is
restricted
due
to
the
inability
to
hire
employees.
In
fact,
the
Maine
Department
of
Labor
statistics
indicate
that
the
child
care
workforce
will
continue
to
see
an
annual
decline
in
employment
of
4.4%
over
the
next
7
years.
The
largest
declining
workforce
employment
in
the
occupation
group
of
Personal
Care
and
Service.
The
average
hourly
wage
of
child
care
employees
is
$15.42
just
slightly
more
than
amusement
and
recreation
attendants
and
less
than
nonfarm
animal
caretakers.
Child
care
educators
commit
to
standards
of
health
and
safety
and
training
in
quality
practices
for
child
development.
They
often
do
not
have
access
to
benefits
such
as
health
care,
paid
time
off,
retirement,
etc.
With
a
declining
child
care
workforce,
programs
are
met
with
challenges
such
as
reducing
hours
of
operation,
closing
classrooms,
lack
of
subs
for
staff
sick
days
leading
to
closures
for
illness,
and
even
closing
all
together.
30%
of
centers
in
a
survey
conducted
by
MaineAEYC
indicated
that
they
are
not
at
full
capacity
of
children
due
to
staffing
shortages.
Of
the
programs
lost
during
the
pandemic,
family
child
care
has
seen
a
significant
decline
which
has
continued
a
decades
long
loss
of
family
child
care
providers.
These
programs
are
a
lifeline
for
many
communities,
and
are
often
more
flexible
to
offer
non-traditional
hours
to
meet
the
working
needs
of
their
families.
While
family
child
care
educators
retire
or
close
businesses,
not
enough
new
family
child
care
programs
are
opening.
In
a
survey
conducted
in
2019,
wages
were
among
the
top
3
challenges
for
family
child
care
providers
to
sustain
their
business.

In
order
to
build
child
care
back
in
Maine,
we
have
to
address
the
foundational
issues
that
have
plagued
the
industry
for
decades.
Until
the
workforce
is
provided
with
professional
compensation
for
the
very
skilled
and
crucial
work
they
do,
child
care
will
continue
to
face
constant
staff
shortages
and
turnover.
We
must
recognize,
as
stated
by
the
U.S.
Treasury,
that
child
care
is
a
failed
market.
In
order
for
Maine’s
economy
to
thrive
and
grow,
then
we
need
to
further
invest
in
the
workforce
behind
the
workforce.
We
also
need
to
invest
in
affordability
for
families
by
increasing
eligibility
for
families
to
access
the
Child
Care
Subsidy
Program.
By
increasing
subsidy
eligibility
for
families
from
85%
SMI
to
125%
SMI,
families
who
often
feel
the
most
struggles
and
leave
the
workforce,
the
lower
middle
class
families,
would
have
access
to
support
for
paying
for
child
care.
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by
Supporting
Child
Care
for
Working
Families
includes
these
foundational
fixes
of
wages
for
educators
and
affordability
for
families.
If
we
want
to
really
address
child
care
this
session
and
make
it
work
better
for
all
Maine
families
than
LD
1726
should
be
included
in
this
change
package.
Thank
you
and
we
are
happy
to
answer
any
questions
from
members
of
the
committees.
