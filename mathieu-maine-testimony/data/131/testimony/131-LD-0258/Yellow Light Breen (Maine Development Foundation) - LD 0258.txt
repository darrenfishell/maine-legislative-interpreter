Economic Advancement & Business 
In Support of Funding in L.D. 258: FY24-FY25 "Biennial Budget Bill" 
for the Maine Development Foundation & Maine Economic Growth Council 
February 15, 2023 
The Maine Development Foundation offers testimony, via our CEO Yellow Light Breen of Holden, Maine, in 
support of the proposed appropriation of $58,444 annually to the Maine Development Foundation and $90,395 
annually to the Maine Economic Growth Council (served by DECD as fiscal agent). 
MDF is a statewide non-profit, non-partisan membership organization uniquely established by the Legislature 
and the Governor in 1977 to work across the business, government, and education sectors to provide an 
objective, respected, long-range vision and strategies for growing Maine's economy. We do this through our 
trusted economic research, leadership programs, and several signature public-private partnerships. 
in support of funding the Maine Development Foundation at $58,444 annualiy__(page A-191) 
The proposed budget currently supports two programs at MDF. 
Realize Maine Network: 
First, the budget bill amount includes $33,444 annually for the Realize Maine Network, as it has since FY2008. 
The Realize Maine Network is a coalition of locally-based organizations working together to retain and attract 
young people to Maine, empower them to reach their greatest career and civic potential, and create 
opportunities to keep them living, working, and thriving in our state. The driving force behind the Network is its 
affiliated regional groups, each of which is autonomous and unique to a different place in Maine. Groups work 
independently and collaboratively to create opportunities for young people to network, build their communities, 
and pursue their aspirations. 
The generous support of the Maine Legislature funds two important activities. A portion of the money is used by 
MDF to provide organizational and technical support to the all-volunteer Network and its members throughout 
the year. Services include coordinating the Network steering committee, sharing best practices, fiscal 
management, and representation of the program inside and outside of Maine, to name just a few. 
Money also funds a competitive grant program (administered by MDF) awarded directly to the regional groups 
to implement projects in their communities. Both MDF and the Network continue to use the State's investment 
to leverage additional multiples of private and philanthropic funds to support these activities. 
The Network is supported by a dedicated steering committee led by a chair, marketing chair, and secretary. The 
Network is currently re-energized with the recent addition of two new member groups (PROPEL in Portland and 
Live + Work in Maine which is statewide). The additions are a result of the steering committee's continued focus 
on raising visibility/awareness of RM N, helping member groups market themselves and their events, and

recruiting new regional affiliate representation. (Skowhegan is testing the waters by engaging with Waten/ille- 
based KV Connect and now Biddeford is exploring formation of a group). 
The member groups adapted extremely well to the limitations created by COVID in 2020, creatively offering 
outdoor events and virtual offerings. Some of these were so successful that the groups continue those offering 
even while returning mostly to in-person programming. Examples of group successes include: 
0 FUSION: Bangor held a day-long conference in September 2022 for a community discussion focused on 
social equity, including housing and robust downtowns. 
u KV Connect routinely partners with community groups to provide volunteers for those groups’ activities, 
as a way of raising the group's visibility and giving back. 
0 All of the groups partnered with Live + Work in Maine in 2021 and 2022 to host "Welcome Home" 
events, social gatherings that create a welcoming environment and networking for locals, 
Boomerangers, and those interested in making Maine home. 
RMN continues to devote some funds to scholarships for younger leaders to access MDF's statewide leadership 
development opportunities such as Leadership Maine and the Institute for Civic Leadership. 
And, in 2022 KV Connect hosted Magnetize Maine, a statewide event bringing together members of all regional 
Realize Maine Network groups and other leaders to tackle issues important to young professionals across the 
state. KV Connect offered workshops on personal brand, mentoring, how to be an effective manager, and other 
pertinent topics; each workshop was held at a different area restaurant which had the added benefit of 
spotlighting the Waten/ille Downtown's recent growth and revitalization and supporting local businesses. This 
year's Magnetize is scheduled for August 2023 in Aroostook County. 
All the above types of activities are made possible in part by the funded sub-grant program. The grant program 
includes small regional planning grants designed to help groups explore the viability of a project idea; larger 
project grants up to $5,000 designed to help groups start or significantly expand "best practice" events or 
programs that can be easily duplicated in any region; and seed funds to help approved and accepted new 
regional groups with start-up expenses so they can build their own sustainable funding base through 
partnerships, grants, sponsorships, small event fees, and/or membership fees. 
Realize Maine plays an important role in addressing Maine's demographic challenges by actively engaging young 
people in leading solutions for their community and economy. Efforts like Live + Work in Maine build a funnel of 
talent and Realize Maine works to make the local connections sticky and lasting! 
Maine Downtown Center: 
Second, the budget bill continues to include $25,000 annually to the Maine Downtown Center (MDC), as the 
Maine Legislature has provided since FY2012. The MDC was established in state law in 1999 as a public-private 
partnership based at MDF. MDC serves as the state coordinator for the National Main Street Center, utilizing the 
43-year-old Main Street Four-Point Approach which has earned a reputation as one of the most powerful local 
economic development tools in the nation focusing on design, organization, economic vitality, and promotions. 
The MDC's mission is to advance preservation-based economic development in downtowns across Maine, 
resulting in business growth, job creation, building rehabilitation, cultural enhancement, and organizational 
MDF Budget Testimony February 15, 2023 Page 2 of4
leadership. The MDC and its 15-member professional Advisory Council serves as a clearinghouse and technical 
assistance resource for all Maine communities interested in undertaking downtown revitalization projects. The 
Center currently has 24 communities in its formal program -- 10 nationally accredited Main Street programs and 
14 state-designated Maine Downtown Affiliates -- and serves dozens more with programming and assistance. 
Reinvestment statistics from 2002 to 2020 from our 10 Nationally designated Main Street Communities 
included: 
o 444 net new businesses 
o Nearly 2000 new jobs 
o 1030 building rehabilitations 
o 937 building rehabilitations 
o A total reinvestment of $272 million 
o A reinvestment ratio of $20.18 for every $1 spent by the local community 
ln 2022, Heart of Biddeford, one of Maine's nationally accredited Main Streets ,was named a Great American 
Main Street by Main Street America. This is the highest honor a Main Street can achieve, and it is Maine's 
second such awardee with Bath being the first (2012) and only the sixth ever awarded in all of New England. 
MDC is a busy, efficient operation including two full-time Program Directors and one part-time Program 
Coordinator. ln 2023, MDC will hold numerous trainings including two Maine Downtown institutes; four 
webinars; ten Main Street Annual Accreditation Site Visits; and numerous site visits, public presentations, and 
individual community trainings. 
We are very appreciative of your support to keep the "public” in this successful public—private partnership. The 
leverage obtained from this General Fund support (less than 5% of the MDC's total budget) is exponential. ln 
2019 and 2021 MDC was awarded a total of $1.5 million from the National Park Service through the Historic 
Preservation Fund for a bricks and mortar sub-grant program for historic downtown buildings that drive 
economic development. MDC was awarded the largest amount in the country both years and was able to sub- 
grant to 10 projects in Augusta, Ellsworth, Norway, Eastport, Gardiner, Machias, Rumford, Skowhegan, Bath and 
Dover-Foxcroft. MDC was also awarded a $747,000 in Congressionally Directed Spending ("earmark") to build 
strong entrepreneur ecosystems in rural Maine. ln addition to extensive technical assistance, $540,000 of the 
total will be passed through to 9 communities. 
In additional sup_port of Fulfilling Commitments, Leveraging Potential, Realizing Opportunities 
We seek your support for the proposed appropriations and would be grateful for it. However, we also 
respectfully ask you to consider increasing the level of state General Fund investment in MDF overall to make up 
for years of inflation-eroded flat-funding; to fulfill the original pledge to match MDF’s private sector 
membership funding up to $250k per year (Public Laws 1977 c. 548, sec. 3); and to also expand the reach of the 
MDC specifically to better serve rural and smaller service centers; better leverage outside investments, with an 
additional $175k per year achieving parity with the $200k total per year in Maine CDBG funding received by the 
MDC. This would total an additional $425,000 each year. We pledge we would match any additional funding at 
MDF Budget Testimony February 15, 2023 Page 3 of4
least an additional 1:1 (and likely much more) even though currently MDF has already leveraged state General 
Fund investments 20:1. We can supply more details on impact at work session. 
In support of funding the Maine Economic Growth Council at $90,395 annuallﬂpage A-204) 
MDF administers the work of the Maine Economic Growth Council, an independent body created in statute in 
1993 to develop and assess our progress toward a long-term vision for Maine's economic growth. DECD is the 
Council's fiscal agent. Council members are jointly appointed by the Governor, Speaker of the House, and 
President of the Senate, and represent a broad and diverse cross~section of leaders across Maine's key 
constituencies, including the public, private, and non-profit sectors. 
The Council's annual Measures of Growth report (”MOG") is an objective, data-driven, and trusted assessment 
of Maine's progress toward the Council's vision of ”a high quality of life for all Maine people” . Measures of 
Growth includes key indicators and benchmarks that support a vibrant and sustainable economy, thriving 
communities, and a healthy environment. The 28th Measures of Growth report was released in November 2022. 
The Council and MDF make every effort to provide a product that helps policymakers focus their efforts and 
understand the connections between and among the major issues affecting the economy and the well-being of 
Maine people. The indicators included give context to Maine's long-term performance by comparing to U.S., 
New England, and EPSCoR averages. The MOG helped provide the situational analysis for Maine's 10-Year 
Economic Development Strategy (2019) and presently assists DECD in tracking progress towards the plan's goals. 
in many ways the short—term disruptions of pandemic and recessions magnify the value of the long-term insights 
provided by the MOG — spotlighting the importance of Maine's workforce, innovation, and connectivity, and 
both our longstanding strengths and most notable challenges shape our resilience and our path forward. 
Constant refinement occurs to better reflect current circumstances: since 2019 Measures of Growth has added 
four new measures: Racial/Ethnic income Equity, Prekindergarten Education, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and 
Mental & Behavioral Health. We have also adjusted the methodology to improve the utility of several metrics, 
including Broadband Connectivity to track access to high-speed service; Postsecondary Degrees & Credentials to 
now include valuable non-degree certifications; Entrepreneurship now measures how/if start-ups outpace 
closures; and Labor Force Participation better tracks in which industries and sectors Mainers are working in — or 
leaving. The MOG presentation was reorganized so that MOG can more readily be used to track the progress of 
the 10-Year Economic Development Strategy. importantly, MOG has become a vastly improved tool for public 
usage and understanding with the addition of a mobile-optimized and enhanced digital presentation in 2021. 
We are grateful to the Governor and Legislature for increasing funding to $90k per year beginning in FY21-22, up 
from an unsustainable level of $55k, and encourage you to support full funding for the Council. We look 
forward to continuing to work with the Council to provide a valuable and trusted perspective for Maine leaders. 
Thank you for this opportunity to update you on our efforts and seek your continued co-investment in MDF.

Yellow, 
Thank you for contacting the Law and Legislative Reference Library, a non-partisan office of the 
lviaine Legislature. 
Unallocated language in El 1977 ch, 545 appears to answer your question: 
Sec. 3. Appropriation. 
There is appropriated from the General Fund the sum of $250,000 for the fiscal years 1977- 
78 and 1978-79 to assist the foundation in its efforts to foster, support and assist economic 
growth and revitalization in the State. It is provided, however, that no amount of the 
appropriation shall be provided to the foundation unless the foundation can demonstrate a 
matching and equal fiscal support from its private and public corporators and members 
described in Title 10, chapter 107. 
if you have further questions please feel free to contact us again.
