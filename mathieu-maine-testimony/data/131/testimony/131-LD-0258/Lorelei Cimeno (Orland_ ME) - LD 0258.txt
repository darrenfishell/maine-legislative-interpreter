Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and 
honorable members of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and 
Financial Affairs and Labor and Housing: my name is Lorelei Cimeno and I live in 
Orland, Maine. Everyone, no matter how much they make or what they do for a 
living, should be able to take care of themselves or a loved one in times of illness or 
other crises without going into debt, risking their job or housing, or making other 
terrible tradeoffs. But the majority of Mainers don’t have access to any extended paid 
leave to care for themselves or loved ones. It doesn’t have to be that way. I urge you 
to set aside funds in the budget to cover the estimated $65 Million in start-up costs to 
make paid leave a reality for all Maine workers and their families.
