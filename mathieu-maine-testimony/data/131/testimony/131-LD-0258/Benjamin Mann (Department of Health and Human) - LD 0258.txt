Hearing Date: February 22, 2023 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services; my name is Benjamin Mann, Deputy 
Commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). I am here today to 
speak in support of LD 258, the Governor ’s Biennial Budget proposal for State ﬁscal years 2024 
and 2025. 
Overall Budget 
This budget advances the Governor ’s guiding belief that to build a stronger, more prosperous state 
where opportunity is available to all, then we must invest in the infrastructure that supports the 
people of Maine, our greatest asset. 
That is why this budget proposal strengthens the very things that Maine people rely on every day 
to succeed. It builds on the strong success of the currently enacted budget and the work done in 
last legislative session to tackle Maine’s greatest challenges. 
We have governed cautiously and in a ﬁscally prudent way over the past four years, making sure 
that ~ even in the hardest of times during the pandemic — We lived within our means. This budget 
proposal continues that practice. 
Highlights from Department of Health and Human Services 
Governor Mills’ budget proposal for the DHHS FY24-25 biennial budget continues policy 
efforts that were initiated at the beginning of her Administration, such as expanding access to 
health care and child care, as well as rebuilding critical parts of State government, such as the 
Maine CDC. This budget makes historic investments in behavioral health, increases supports for 
older Mainers, and supports a transformation of services for adults with intellectual and

developmental disabilities (IDD). The budget also provides funding for cost-of-living 
adjustments in numerous MaineCare and related provider payment rates in the wake of high 
inﬂation, consistent with Public Law 2021, chapter 398, Part AAAA as well as MaineCare rate 
reform as codiﬁed in Public Law 2021, chapter 639. 
For the Department ’s budget as a whole, the Governor is proposing funding of $638 million 
($316 million General Fund) for ﬁscal years 2024 and 2025. This would be partially offset by 
$5 9 million in one-time deappropriations and lapse of prior year carrying balances to ensure that 
we are being ﬁscally prudent and living within our means. We look forward to working with 
both the AFA and HHS Committees to review this budget in detail and make needed investments 
in health and human services for the people of Maine.
