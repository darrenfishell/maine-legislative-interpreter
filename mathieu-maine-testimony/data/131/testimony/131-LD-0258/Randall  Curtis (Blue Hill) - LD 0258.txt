Appropriations Statement of Support for the Community Resilience Partnership 
Program  
7 June, 2023  
 
I wish to write in support of the increase in the state ’s investment to $3 million a 
year for the state ’s Community Resilience Partnership Program (CRP).   The CRP 
has provided grants and technical support to all 9 towns of the Blue Hill Peninsula 
covering town identified needs for climate resilience planning and emissions 
reductions planning.  
 
In Blue Hill, where I sit on the town ’s Climate Resilience Committ ee, we have 
benefited dramatically from the technical assistance of a state supported service 
provider who helped us with:  
a) signing up to join the Community Resilience Partnership  
b) a successful $1M grant from the state Infrastructure Adaptation Fund that was 
eligible for a lower local match  
c) a $175,000 Community Action Grant for a three town climate Vulnerability 
Assessment study with Surry and Brooksville  
 
This support has been crucial in helping us plan for and start raising financing for 
our was tewater treatment plant which serves a whole set of community lifelines 
required by not only the town of Blue Hill but all 9 towns on the peninsula 
including the regional hospital, two grocery stores, 4 schools, 2 hardware stores, a 
community laundry and a  significant number of businesses.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.
