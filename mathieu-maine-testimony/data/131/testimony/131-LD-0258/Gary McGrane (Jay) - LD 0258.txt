Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and other esteemed members of 
the /appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, my name is Gary 
Nleﬂrane and l live in the town of Jay. I retired as an educator from the 
University of Maine in 2015. After retirement I continued to he active in 
the Maine Education Association — Retired group of educators; first as 
deeretary, then as President-elect then as President. I have rounded out 
my eareer in education by helping others less fortunate whose retirement 
loenefits have been eroded by the Windfall Elimination Protection and/or 
the {Government Pension Offset. 
l understand we cannot change these detrimental pieces of federal 
legislation today; however, you can try and make our MEA 
members whole by restoring the debilitating effects of inflation. l 
em liere today in support of restoring our members’ buying power. 
We ere not asking for a raise we are simply asking that our 
eelueators be allowed to retire with the full buying power of their 
state pension. Unfortunately, many of our members cannot retire 
leeeauee their retirement income has not kept pace with inflation. 
Therefore, H am here today to testify neither for nor against the Governor ’s 
proposed change package to LD 258, specifically related to part HHHHH 
of the proposal. lt is my understanding that Part HHHHH proposes a one- 
time, ad hoe QQLA of 3% for retirees. While We appreciate the proposal, 
We fear it is not enough to provide the support retired teachers and state 
employees needi l implore you to find a Way to help these dedicated 
worlrers to he able to retire with dignity and respect. Thank you for your 
consideration in making this ad hoe adjustment permanent. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Gary IVleGrane, immediate Past President of MEA-Retired
