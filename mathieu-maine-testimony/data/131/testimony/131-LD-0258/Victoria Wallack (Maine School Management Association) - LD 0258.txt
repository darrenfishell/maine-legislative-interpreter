Director of Communications and Government Relations for Maine School Management Association testifying 
in support of L.D. 258  on behalf of the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards and Maine School 
Superintendents Associations.  
 
Our members apprecia te the ongoing support from Governor Mills , the Appro priations Committee  and the 
Education Committee for funding public education at the promised 55 percent. Meeting that obligation  sends 
an important message to our school districts  and is respectful to t axpayers who have consistently supported 
local school budgets across the state.  
 
We also want to  highlight our support for  fully funding school meals for all students, regardless of their 
familyâ€™s income. This eliminates any stigma that occurred under the old system . 
 
We also want to note the continued support in the budget for Career and Technical Education , which prepare s 
our students for work after graduation  and helps them de cide what job s and careers they want to pursu e. This 
workforce development is essential a s our current workforce moves toward retirement.
