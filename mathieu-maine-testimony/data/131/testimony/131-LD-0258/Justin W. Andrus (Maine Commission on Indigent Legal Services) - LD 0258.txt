MCILS INITIATIVE 1 — ASSIGNED COUNSEL PAYMENTS 
TO: JUDICIARY AND AFA COMMITTEES 
FROM: JUSTIN W. ANDRUS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MCILS 
SUBJECT: MCILS INITLATIV E 1- AS SIGNED COUNSEL PAYMENTS 
DATE: 2/23/2023 
CC: COMMISSION; INTERESTED PARTIES 
MCILS budget Initiative 1 requests an appropriation to permit us to maintain the rate increase from 
$80 to $150 into the next biennium. MCILS respectfully reduces the appropriation it requests 
through Initiative 1 from $21,457,780 to $18,606,910 in each year of the biennium. 
During Fiscal Year 2022, MCILS assigned counsel invoiced and were paid for 252,117 hours. For 
the rolling year February 22, 2022, to February 23, 2022, MCILS assigned counsel invoiced for 
and were paid for 265,813 hours. This is an increase of 13,696 hours, or approximately 5%. We 
attribute this increase in hours worked to an increase in substantive in-court work performed by 
counsel. 
MCILS can never perfectly predict the number of hours for which it will be responsible because 
the ﬂow of work in the Courts changes from time to time. We are using the year-on-year number 
of 265,813 as the most recent accurate count. We calculate the requested new appropriation as 
follows: 
Hours 265,813 
@$80 $ 21,265,040.00 
@$l50 $ 39,87I,950.00 
New appropriation $ 18,606,910.00' 
The current Executive Branch initiative to provide additional funding to support assigned counsel 
rates would provide $6,100,000, a difference of $12,506,910.
