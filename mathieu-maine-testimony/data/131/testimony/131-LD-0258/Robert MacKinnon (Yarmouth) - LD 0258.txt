RE:  Support of the Governor’s Budget Change Package, Part MMMM, funding for water and 
wastewater infrastructure 
 
Dear Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and Members of the Appropriations and Financial 
Affairs Committee: 
 
I retired two years ago after a 36 year career with the Yarmouth Water District. During my tenure 
at the District I had the honor of serving multiple terms on the Maine Public Drinking Water 
Commission. As a commissioner I worked closely with the Drinking Water Program on many 
challenging issues. One issue that we repeatedly had to deal with was obtaining the necessary State 
funding match needed to leverage the Federal funding for water infrastructure projects, via the 
State Revolving Loan Program (SRF Program). I found it troublesome that so much of the 
Drinking Water Programs effort and time was spent on obtaining the needed funding, especially 
when there were so many other important issues to be working on. We were finally able to secure 
the match for multiple years, allowing utilities from all over the State to replace and improve their 
system’s infrastructure. I can tell you from my personal experience that the SRF Program enabled 
us to do major infrastructure replacement projects that we have been unable to do otherwise. I 
would urge the Committee to adopt Part MMMM of the budget change package to provide the 
matching funding. This investment in the future will help utilities provide safe, affordable water 
for future generations to come. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Robert MacKinnon Jr. 
 
Retired Superintendent, Yarmouth Water District
