Testimony on 
L.D. 1933, “An Act to Increase the Debt Limit of the Limerick 
Water District ” 
Presented by 
Representative David Woodsome 
District 139 
Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee 
Thursday, May 18, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and 
distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities, and Technology: 
I am State Representative David Woodsome, and I proudly 
represent District 139, Limerick, Parsonsfield, and a portion of 
Waterboro. It is an honor to appear before you today for the 
purpose of introducing L.D. 1933, “An Act to Increase the Debt 
Limit of the Limerick Water District. ” 
The intent of this bill is simple. If passed, L.D. 1933 will 
allow for the Limerick Water and Sewer District to increase its 
debt limit from $1 million to $2 million for the purpose of 
improving and addressing critical needs. 
With a $1.2 million project in process to improve the water 
quality for all of the District's customers, a challenge arose 
to acquire needed funding under its current debt limit. Having 
to front all of the money, incurring a great expense, followed 
by a period of time to be reimbursed triggered the debt limit 
increase need. Increasing the debt limit will improve the 
District's chances of being approved for the remaining sought 
after funds via the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Program 
that is approved and administered by the Maine Bond Bank. 
Thank you for your consideration. Those testifying after me 
are better suited to answer any questions you may\have at this 
time.
