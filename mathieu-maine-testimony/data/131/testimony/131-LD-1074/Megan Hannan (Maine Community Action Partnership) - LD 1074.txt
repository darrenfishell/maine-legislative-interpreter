207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports Housing Sections of 
L.D. 1074 An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund 
New Affordable Housing for Low-income Households 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, members of the Committee on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs, I am Megan Hannan, Executive 
Director of Maine Community Action Partnership, and we support LD 
1074 An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund New 
Affordable Housing for Low-income Households.- 
Our state’s greatest resource is our people, and our state’s policies and 
budget shape pe0pIe’s possibilities. In Community Action, we create 
conditions that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, 
tapping into the hidden potential in our communities. Through our 
Whole Family approach, we build a family's capacity for sustained 
stability and economic growth. We invest in the family's well-being, we 
let them drive their own story, and we have tangible success. 
Vlﬁth that success comes social and economic mobility, the opportunity to 
build a sense of safety for themselves and their family. But even with that, 
even with a little more money to spend on the roof over one’s head, we 
have a crisis in Maine. Rents are going up in every town and city, and too 
many of the people we depend on — teachers, police, plumbers — are 
being squeezed out." 
Compounding the problem in Maine is simply that we do not have enough 
housing built and move in ready for all who need it, let alone housing 
speciﬁcally for working people and families. The $100 million bond 
proposed to increase the supply of housing is one of- the most important 
things we can do this year, and I hope you will support it. We have public 
and private companies and community action agencies that want to build 
more workforce housing, but building new developments is costly and 
when you are also assuming lower rents, the math doesn't always look 
good. . 
The programs we have in place, the Rural Rental Program and Low 
Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program, both administered by 
MaineHousing, are critical to our success. Adding this funding to what 
already exists is necessary now, as we know we need to build more 
housing to meet the needs of our communities. We have asked for money 
in the budget and certainly hope that is still in the mix. This adds more, 
very necessary money to that table from a different source. 
Thank you very much _ for your time and consideration.
