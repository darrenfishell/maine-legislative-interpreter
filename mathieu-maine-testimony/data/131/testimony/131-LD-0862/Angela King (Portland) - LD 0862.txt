Greetings
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
T ransportation:
My
name
is
Angela
King,
Advocacy
Manager
for
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
(BCM).
Our
mission
is
to
make
Maine
better
and
safer
for
bicycling
and
walking.
On
behalf
of
BCM,
and
aligned
with
the
views
of
our
more
than
20,000
members
and
supporters,
this
testimony
is
submitted
in
OPPOSITION
to
LD
862.
Rail
lines
in
Maine
are
supervised,
managed
and
in
some
cases,
owned
by
the
Department
of
T ransportation.
The
BCM
believes
that
the
public
interest
is
best
served
if
the
MaineDOT
continues
in
these
roles,
and
that
management
of
these
assets
continue
to
be
managed
by
a
public
entity
and
arm
of
state
government.
T ransferring
“jurisdiction”
for
rail
lines
to
an
“independent
authority”
is
a
policy
directive
that
is
largely
opaque
and
therefore
unsupportable.
What
does
“jurisdiction”
even
mean
–
control
over
these
assets,
or
removal
of
these
assets
from
public
processes
such
as
Rail
Use
Advisory
Councils
that
assess
the
best
and
highest
use
of
these
corridors?
And
is
the
independent
authority
a
private
corporation,
a
quasi-governmental
entity
like
the
T urnpike
Authority ,
or
something
else?
In
the
absence
of
any
details
about
what
this
bill
is
seeking
to
do,
the
BCM
opposes
LD
862
and
recommends
an
Ought
Not
to
Pass
report.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service
to
the
people
of
Maine.
Sincerely ,
Angela
King
Advocacy
Manager
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
