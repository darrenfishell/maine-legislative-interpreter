I am the Assistant Vice President, Government Affairs, for Genesee & Wyoming RR 
Services, Inc.  The St. Lawrence & Atlantic RR (SLR), based in Auburn, ME 
provides international rail freight service to numerous Maine businesses located on 
the SLR as well as businesses that are served via transload operations. I have worked 
with Maine DOT's rail division for over 25 years in support and partnership with the 
SLR.  I have always found Maine DOT to be interested and focused on railroad 
safety, operations, investment through public-private partnerships, and the needs of 
Maine businesses that utilize freight rail for their supply chain needs. Moving the 
oversight of railroads away from Maine DOT would diminish the effectiveness of the 
state's involvement, cooperation, coordination, and success in dealing with a 
constantly changing rail network needs that extend into neighboring states and 
Canada.
