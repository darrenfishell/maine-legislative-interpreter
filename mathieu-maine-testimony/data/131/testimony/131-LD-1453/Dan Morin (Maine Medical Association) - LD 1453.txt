RE:   NFNA - LD 1453 , An Act to Amend the Physical Therapist Practice Laws  
 
The Maine Medical Association is Maine’s largest professional association representing over 
4,300 current and future physicians from all specialties in all practice settings.  
 
Unfortunately, the Maine Medical Association’s legislative Committee, which provides guidance 
and feedback on proposed state legislation has not fully reviewed the contents of LD 1453. 
 
The bill will be presented along with a slate of other bills for consideration tomorrow evening, 
Wednesday, April 25, to discuss the access to care issue along with any potential safety 
concerns that may present to members relating to scope of practice.  
 
If necessary, we will submit written comments as soon as possible prior to any scheduled work 
session on the bill.  
 
We respectfully apologize for not contributing sooner. Thank you for accepting our comments.
