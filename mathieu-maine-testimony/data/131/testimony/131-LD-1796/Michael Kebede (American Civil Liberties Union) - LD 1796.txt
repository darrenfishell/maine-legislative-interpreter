AMERIGAN CIVIL UBERTIES UNION 
Maine 
TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ. 
Ought Not to Pass - LD 1796 
An Act to Protect Maine's Transit Employees 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY 
May 2, 2023 
Senator Bebee-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety, greetings. My name is Michael Kebede, 
and I am the Policy Counsel at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed to 
advancing and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. 
Constitutions. On behalf of our members, we urge you to oppose Section l of LD 1796, which 
proposes to make it a Class C crime to assault a transit employee. 
The ACLU of Maine has long opposed unnecessary expansion of our state’s criminal code. It 
has been our position that creating new crimes for behavior that is already illegal does not deter bad 
behavior but does expand our jail and prison populations. Even with one of the lowest incarceration 
rates in the country, our state’s incarceration rate is still higher than the incarceration rates of Bahrain, 
Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Israel, Turkey, Portugal and the United Kingdom, among 
many other countries. Class C crimes cany a possible 5-year prison sentence and $5000 ﬁne. This 
bill’s new crime would duplicate the already-existing Class D crime of assault, which carries a 
possible 1-year prison sentence and $2,000 ﬁne. 17-A MRS §207. 
The approach to this problem that Section 2 of this bill takes, public education and better 
training for transit employees, is more promising than increased criminalization. Our opposition 
is therefore restricted to Section 1 of this bill. We urge you to either vote ought not to pass, or 
amend this bill to remove Section 1’s criminal penalty.
