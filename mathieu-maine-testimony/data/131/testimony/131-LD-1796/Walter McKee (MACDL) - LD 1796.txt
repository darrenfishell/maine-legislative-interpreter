RE: LD 1796 --  An Act to Protect Maine ’s Transit Employees  
 
Dear Senator Beebe -Center , Represe ntative  Salisbury, and Mem bers of the Crimin al 
Justice and Pu blic Safety Committee:  
 
MACDL opposes  LD 1796.   
 
This bill makes it a felony  offense to commit any assault wh atsoever on a “transit 
employee. ”  This includes spitting at a transit employee.  
 
While  we can all a gree th at assaulting anyone and even spitting on them is a crime for 
which there should be  a punishment, making this a full -blown felony  level off ense is 
inappropriate , inconsistent with basic principles of criminal  justice,  and not 
proportionate to the offense.  
 
As it stands now, and as MACDL has said repeatedly this past session, a person who  
commits assau lt on a transit worker is subjected to a penalty of up to 364 days in jail 
as well as fines.  T here is no evidence that any judge, much less a prosecutor, has ever 
sugg ested that the current c rime is an insufficient deterrent and that  the jud ge or the 
prosecutor would seek to impose a sentence of more than 364 days in jail for  a person 
engaged in these acts.  
 
Felony crimes should be reserved for those par ticularly outrage ous or repeated such 
that a person should be branded a felon for th e rest  of their li fe and suffer all of th ose 
many significant consequences.   Assault on a transit employee is not one of those 
crimes.  
 
Do not c reate a new felony.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to address this issue.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Walter F. McKee  
Chair, Legi slative Committee
