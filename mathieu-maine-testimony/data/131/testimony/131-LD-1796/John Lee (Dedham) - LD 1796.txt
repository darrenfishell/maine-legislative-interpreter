LD 1796
Good afternoon,
I am submitting this written testimony in support of LD 1796 An Act to Protect 
Transit Workers. As a longtime transit worker who currently works for the City of 
Bangor at the Community Connector, I strongly support this vital legislation. Assaults
on transit workers happen far to often and, in most cases, are without consequences 
for those who commit these attacks.
Imagine for a moment that a passenger on a bus were to assault a driver causing that 
driver to lose control of their vehicle. Not only is the driver and all of the passengers 
on the bus at risk but also other motorists and pedestrians. The bus could cross over 
into on coming traffic and have a head-on collision or run off the road into a crowded 
area striking innocent pedestrians.
This legislation would serve as notice that an assault on a transit worker would not be 
tolerated here in the State of Maine…that to do so would be a Class C crime and 
anyone committing such a crime will be held accountable.
I have been in the transit industry since the early 1990’s, mostly in the City of Boston.
I served 24 years with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority also known as
the MBTA. I have since relocated and now proudly call Maine my home. I have taken
a position as a bus operator for the Communtiy Connector and over my career I have 
unfortunately seen many of my coworkers suffer attacks while just trying to do their 
jobs providing a vital public service. You are in a position to help change that by 
supporting this legislation. I am asking that you please get on board and protect transit
workers.
Thank You,
John Lee
