207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Opposes LD 1448 An Act to 
Change the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program 
Requirements by Reducing Benefits Commensurate witha 
Recipient's Salary, Reducing the Special Housing Allowance and 
I 
Limiting Eligibility for 2-parent Families 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Sen/ices, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership and we oppose LD 1448 An 
Act to Change the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program 
Requirements by Reducing Beneﬁts Commensurate with a Recipient's 
Salary, Reducing the Special Housing Allowance and Limiting Eligibility 
for 2-parent Families. 
Our state's greatest resource is our people, and our state’s policies 
shape people's possibilities. In Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the hidden potential in our communities. Through our Whole Family 
approach, we build a family’s capacity for sustained stability and 
economic growth. We invest in the family's well-being, we let them drive 
their own story, and we have tangible success. 
As these families fulfill their promise and make more money, which they 
do, many of the necessary supports that have been there to help them to 
be safely housed, fed well and healthy fall out. You all know about the 
so-called Cliff Effect. It can be devastating to be working hard, enjoying 
yourjob and your children just to have to say “No" to a better job for fear 
of losing those supports. LD 1448 will only exacerbate that cliff, in effect 
punishing people as they get ahead. 
Reducing TANF benefits when a family needs them most is the wrong 
way to help families leave TANF. The economic security of keeping 
earned income adds to the family's well-being, social, emotional and 
economic health — when this is the result, the program has worked as it 
was originally intended, It was created to support families and to build 
social capital and economic independence, not to punish families who 
are doing the right thing. 
Thank you for your time and attention today, I am happy to answer any 
questions that I can.
