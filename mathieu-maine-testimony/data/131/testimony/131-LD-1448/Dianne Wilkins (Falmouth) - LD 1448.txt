Re: Testimony in favor of LD 1488 , An Act Concerning Testing for and Disclosure of PFAS 
Contamination of Residential  Drinking Water Wells  sponsored by Laurie Osher  
 
Dear HHS Committee,  
 
Plea se vote to pass LD 1 488.  
 
With 50% of Mainers getti ng their drinking water from residential well s, it’s absolutely a no -
brainer  that the state  should  require  a seller & landlord  “Homeowner’s  Disclos ure” to let 
tenants and real estate buyers know if and when a residential well has been tested for PFAS and 
the results of that testi ng.   
 
This is a reasonable  policy  change  as people have a right to know  about what’s  in the ir drinking 
water  so they can protect their fa milies from exposure to th is deadly toxin  and the state a lready 
require s disclosure for arsenic, r adon and other testing for residential wells . The serious and 
significant health risks associated with  PFAS exposure warrants this prec autionary  measure.  
 
Sincerely,  
Dianne Wilkins
