Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1448:
“An
Act
to
Change
the
Temporary
Assistance
for
Needy
Families
Program
Requirements
by
Reducing
Benefits
Commensurate
with
a
Recipient's
Salary,
Reducing
the
Special
Housing
Allowance
and
Limiting
Eligibility
for
2-parent
Families”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1448.
This
bill
seeks
to
provide
a
solution
to
the
phenomenon
known
as
“the
welfare
cliff,”
a
situation
in
which
someone
on
welfare
loses
the
entirety
of
their
benefits
after
working
enough
to
earn
a
certain
level
of
income.
1
This
naturally
disincentivizes
people
on
welfare
programs
to
continue
working
and
earning
more.
Instead,
they
may
try
to
not
work
too
much
in
order
to
avoid
the
“cliff”
that
results
in
lost
benefits.
LD
1448
would
smooth
out
this
transition
by
phasing
down
the
level
of
one’s
benefits
over
the
following
year
starting
at
the
third
consecutive
month
of
working,
to
75%
of
the
benefit
level,
through
the
ninth
consecutive
month
of
employment,
and
to
50%
after
that.
As
long
as
Maine
continues
to
reject
work
requirements
for
these
benefits
in
the
first
place,
this
bill
provides
a
reasonable
translation
period
for
workers
on
the
TANF
bubble.
To
make
up
for
these
extended
benefits,
the
bill
also
reduces
the
special
housing
allowance
offered
to
those
on
TANF,
and
tightens
eligibility
requirements
to
ensure
that
single-parent
households
receive
benefits
first.
We
understand
that
these
inclusions
are
not
part
of
the
sponsor’s
intent,
but
we
see
them
as
appropriate
reforms
in
service
of
a
more
accountable
system
that
prioritizes
the
truly
needy.
Please
deem
LD
1448
“Ought
To
Pass”
to
ensure
greater
accountability
in
our
welfare
system,
and
provide
Mainers
on
welfare
a
path
to
meaningful
work
and
independence.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
