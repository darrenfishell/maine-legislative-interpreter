LD 282
Good afternoon Senator Joseph Baldacci, Representative Michele Meyer,  and 
distinguished members of this committee,
I am writing to you today to urge you to oppose LD 282,  An Act to Allow the 
Department of Health and Human Services to Authorize Standing Orders .
My understanding is that “standing orders” by their nature foster a cookie cutter 
approach to a patient.  Such an approach is flawed because no medical procedure is a 
one size fits all.   Aspirin is safe for some people but can cause eye bleeding in others.
Milk and chocolate are great for some people and cause significant problems to 
others.  Vaccines have complex ingredients and have been labeled “unavoidably 
unsafe” by Congress in the National Childhood Vaccine Act of 1986. 1 Vaccines 
should never be taken lightly.   Certainly the people that are targeted by this bill need 
individualized, precision medical care. To me, this bill is going in the direction of a 
technocratic approach to medical care for vulnerable people who are at the mercy of 
the state instead of  individualized patient-centered care.
If a patient refused a standing order would that go on their medical record and 
negatively reflect on future care? This happened in my family when we refused a 
suggested treatment, my family member’s medical record said he had refused care 
and it followed him for years and interfered with insurance payments.  
If the system currently is working without standing orders for vaccines and 
nonprescription drugs, then it seems like this bill is not needed.
Please vote to  “oppose”  LD 282.
