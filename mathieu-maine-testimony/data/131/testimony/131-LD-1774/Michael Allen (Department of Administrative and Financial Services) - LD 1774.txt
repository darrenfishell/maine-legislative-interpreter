 TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Hearing Date: May 9, 2023 
  
LD 1774 – “An Act Exempting Certain Emergency Distributions and Emergency 
Savings Accounts from Taxation” 
 
 
 Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee – good afternoon, my name is Michael Allen, Associate Commissioner 
for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  I am 
testifying at the request of the Administration Against LD 1774, “An Act 
Exempting Certain Emergency Distributions and Emergency Savings Accounts 
from Taxation.” 
The bill proposes two new income subtraction modifications from Maine 
adjusted gross income, to the extent included in federal adjusted gross income, 
equal to: (1) any distribution after December 31, 2023, for emergency personal 
expenses from an eligible retirement plan under the federal Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, 
Section 115; and (2) any capital gains, dividends, or interest earned in a pension-
linked emergency savings account described under the federal Secure 2.0 Act of 
2022, Section 127.  
The Administration has proposed to conform to the federal Secure Act 2.0 in 
LD 7 (“An Act to Update References to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 Contained in the Maine Revised Statutes”).  This bill, LD 1774, on the other 
hand, would decouple from the federal treatment of these distributions and 
accounts.  We estimate that the tax savings from this bill will be minimal and may 
create issues in later tax years by being out of conformity with federal tax law.  In 
2 
 general, conformity, especially with retirement provisions, are preferred for both 
the taxpayer and MRS. 
Generally, distributions from an eligible retirement account are subject to 
federal and Maine income taxes, except that a pension-linked emergency savings 
account established under the federal Secure 2.0 Act of 2022 (Secure Act 2.0) is 
funded with after-tax contributions and withdrawals are generally tax free.  Annual 
contributions to a pension-linked emergency savings account are generally limited 
to 3% of an employee’s pay or $2,500 (subject to an inflation adjustment after 
2024), whichever is less. 
For Maine tax purposes, retirement plan distributions included in federal 
adjusted gross income that are not subject to the federal 10% early distribution 
penalty under IRC Section 72(t) may be eligible for the pension income deduction 
under 36 M.R.S. § 5122(2)(M-2), in an amount up to $30,000 for tax years 
beginning in 2023 and $35,000 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. 
For federal tax purposes, early distributions from a retirement plan and 
withdrawals from a pension-linked emergency savings account taken before age 59 
1/2 are generally subject to the federal additional 10% early distribution penalty.  
However, the Secure Act 2.0 provides an exception to the 10% penalty for early 
distributions for emergency personal expenses after December 31, 2023, up to 
$1,000 annually, and for withdrawals from a pension-linked emergency savings 
account funded with after-tax contributions for plan years beginning after 
December 31, 2023. There is no Maine income tax early distribution penalty. 
The Administration notes the following technical concerns: 
• Section 3 of the bill should be amended to include an application date for 
Section 2 of the bill. 
3 
 • The bill should be amended to coordinate the income subtraction 
modifications with the Maine pension income deduction.   
The estimated revenue impact of the bill is not currently available. 
The estimated administrative costs are $22,000 for fiscal year 2024-2025.  
One-time computer programing costs are included to add two additional lines on 
Form 1040ME, Schedule 1S, to update check stub messages and notices, to make 
federal tape changes, and to perform systems testing.   
The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.
