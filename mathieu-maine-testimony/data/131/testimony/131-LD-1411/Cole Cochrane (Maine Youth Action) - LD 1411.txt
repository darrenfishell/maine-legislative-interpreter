Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
the
honorable
members
of
the
Environment
&
Natural
Resources
Committee.
My
name
is
Cole
Cochrane,
I
am
a
senior
at
Thornton
Academy
in
Saco,
and
I
am
representing
Maine
Y outh
Action,
a
statewide
youth
advocacy
group
that
represents
hundreds
of
young
Mainers
across
the
state
from
varying
backgrounds.
Maine
Y outh
Action
is
testifying
in
support
of
LD
141 1,
An
Act
to
Require
the
Adoption
of
Sector -specific
Greenhouse
Gas
Emission
Limits.
Maine
has
become
a
critical
leader
in
the
movement
to
address
the
climate
crisis.
W e
have
established
ambitious
emission
reduction
tar gets,
calling
for
a
45%
decrease
in
GHG
emissions
by
2030
and
at
least
80%
by
2050.
W e
have
created
the
Climate
Council,
a
body
that
represents
all
stakeholders
in
our
climate
action.
I
also
commend
the
state
for
its
creation
of
the
Maine
W on’ t
W ait
climate
strategy ,
a
comprehensive
plan
on
our
approach
to
such
a
complex
issue.
It
has
provided
a
suf ficient
roadmap
to
address
all
emission
sectors.
Although
the
Maine
W on’ t
W ait
climate
plan
may
outline
initiatives
in
each
sector
of
emissions,
it
is
clear
that
the
responsibility
of
reducing
our
emissions
must
be
shared
equitably
and
clearly
understood
amongst
all
decision
makers.
Therefore,
LD
141 1
is
an
integral
piece
to
bolstering
our
response
to
climate
change.
LD
141 1
strengthens
our
existing
law
by
providing
clear
and
tangible
metrics
for
each
emission
sector ,
allowing
the
state
to
measure
its
progress
more
ef fectively .
Currently ,
the
existing
statewide
tar gets
assist
us
in
our
overarching
objectives,
but
does
not
support
more
niche
areas,
such
as
transportation.
Through
the
establishment
of
sector -specific
emission
tar gets,
agencies

will
be
able
to
guide
their
approaches
in
accordance
with
what
is
expected
of
them.
For
example,
a
sector
specific
emission
tar get
for
transportation
would
better
inform
MaineDOT
in
the
direction
of
their
investment
and
decision
making,
such
as
their
levels
of
spending
on
clean
transportation
methods.
Overall,
this
would
be
immensely
helpful
to
our
agencies
and
stakeholders
who
need
a
specific
direction
in
order
to
ef fectively
address
the
problems
we
face
regarding
climate
change.
It
is
imperative
that
we
take
necessary
actions
to
make
our
response
to
climate
change
ef fective,
ef ficient,
and
ur gent
given
the
circumstances.
LD
141 1
is
the
right
step
to
make
to
achieve
those
goals.
Therefore,
I
ur ge
the
committee
to
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
141 1.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service.
