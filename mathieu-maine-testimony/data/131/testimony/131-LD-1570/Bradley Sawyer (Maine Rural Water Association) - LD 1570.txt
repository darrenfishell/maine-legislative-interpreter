Re Testnnony in Support of L D 15 70, An Act to Create the Storm Water Infrastructure 
Repair and Replacement Fund 
Senator Bremier, Representative Gramlich, and Members of the Joint Committee for 
Environment and Natural Resources, thank you for the ability to provide brief testimony on L D. 
1570, An Act to Create the Storm Water Inﬁ'astructure Repair and Replacement Fund 
The Maine Rural Water Association is a member-driven non-proﬁt orgamzation based in 
Richmond that specializes in traming, techmcal assistance, and advocacy on behalf of our almost 
three hundred members The I11ﬂ]0I'1ty of our membership is made up of water and wastewater 
utilities ﬁom around the state and are comimtted to ensurmg clean and safe drinking water anda 
healthy environment through the proper treatment of wastewater 
We support any attempt to increase funding for efforts relating to drinking water, wastewater, 
and stormwater and as such applaud Representative Aiikeles for bringing this forward. In their 2021 
report card, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave Maine’s stormwater mfrastructurea grade 
of C- and expanded on reasons why. They stated 
“Within the past ﬁve decades, extreme precipitation events mcreased by 70% 
which is more sigmﬁcant than m any other U.S. region. Urban stormwater 
disproportionately impacts Mame’s surface water quality considering that only 
2 8% of the state is developed land Dedicated ﬁmding for stormwater 
infrastructure is critical, voter-approved bonds similar to the transportation sector 
and more local stormwater utilities are crucial for serving the present needs while 
preparing for the future ”1 
We would request one small change in the language of this bill While there are not many 
quasi-municipal utilities that are responsible for stormwater they do exist, including in Augusta. We 
suggest that to ensure that this critical fundmg is available to all Mainers the term “or quasi- 
municipal utility (utilities) ” be added where the word municipality or municipalities appears in the 
legislation. 
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at 
Bradley Sawyer@MaineRWA org or 207-737-9014.
