 May 2, 2023 , 20231  RE: LD 1570, An Act to Create the Storm Water Infrastructure Repair and Replacement Fund  Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Distinguished Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,  Thank you for this opportunity to share our support for LD 1570 and its goal of advancing the implementation of better storm water management practices.  Storm water management is an extremely important aspect of maintaining clean and healthy waters. It is also extremely challenging for many towns and cities to manage because of the costs associated with taking actions. Yet the risks are great—runoff is a source of pollution that often brings pesticides, oil, sediment and animal waste to our rivers, streams and coastal waters. The negative impacts can range from long-term habitat degradation to closed beaches. There are certainly impacts on human health as well as the health of fish and animal populations.   Storm water problems are particularly insidious because their impacts are huge and yet these impacts add up from so many disparate individual actions. According to EPA:  Used oil from a single oil change can pollute up to one million gallons of freshwater. Improper disposal of used oil, which includes oil leaking from cars, contributes significantly to stormwater pollution. The EPA estimates that American households improperly dump about 193 million gallons of used oil every year, or roughly the equivalent of 17 Exxon Valdez oil spills.  ( https://www3.epa.gov/region9/water/npdes/stormwater-feature.html)  Widespread as these problems are, funding the solutions to better manage storm water can be a huge challenge for Maine communities. We therefore support this bill and we see the value in creating a Storm Water Infrastructure Repair and Replacement Fund. We see this proposed legislation as an important step in the right direction—toward a stable fund with a funded position at Maine DEP.
