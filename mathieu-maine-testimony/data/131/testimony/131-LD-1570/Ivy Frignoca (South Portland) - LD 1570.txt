RE: Friends of Casco Bay Testimony in Support of LD 1570, An Act to 
Create the Storm Water Infrastructure Repair and  Replacement Fund 
 Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Distinguished Members of the Committee,  
 
Friends of Casco Bay supports LD 1570, An Act to Create the Storm Water 
Infrastructure Repair and Replacement Fund and respectfully requests that the 
Committee vote that the bill Ought To Pass. Stormwater pollution is a major cause 
of poor water quality resulting in  beach closures, fishing c losures, and more. The 
solutions to this problem largely fall on municipalities, which do not have the 
financial resources to repair and upgrade aging infrastructure or install systems to filter stormwater before it reaches our wa terways. LD 1570 provides a good start ; 
it should allocate more than  $10 million dollars  and should specifically fund new 
infrastructure to treat stormwater.  
 Who we are : Friends of Casco Bay works to improve and protect water quality in 
Casco Bay and its watershed. We collect data and advocate for solu tions. 
Stormwater pollution poses one of the biggest threats to our watershed. It sheets off our increasingly urbanized landscapes directly into streams, rivers and the Bay. Stormwater carries all the toxins  it finds, including harmful chemicals from car 
exhaust, pesticides, fertilizers, pet waste, and so much more. This problem will increase as Maine experiences more precipitation and intense storms as a consequence of climate change.   We monitor  the health  of the Bay. Our data show that stormwater carries high  loads of nitrogen that 
cause nuisance algal blooms which smother clam flats and phytoplankton blooms that harm eelgrass and decrease oxygen for marine species. Some phytoplankton blooms are even toxic . Our data also show  
that stormwater carries  mixed and varied loads of pesticides and chlorides .  
 Each year, we identify stormwater pollution as a priority issue. In recent years, we advocated for a stricter MS4 permit to reduce pollution that flows through municipal storm sewer systems from  our 
urbanized areas into tributaries and the Bay. We also have advocated for stricter municipal ordinances to reduce stormwater pollution, and for a state law requiring the Department of Environmental Protection to update its Chapter 500 stormwater regulations. We hope that process starts soon.  
 The Problem : Stormwater delivers the largest  mostly  unregulated loads of pollutants to our 
waters. As we convert natural landscapes to paved surfaces, know n as impervious cover or IC, we 
remove nature’s filtering system. When rainfall reaches an undisturbed watershed, the natural 
   
landscapes absorb and filt er the rainfall before it reaches groundwater or surface water. In urbanized 
environments, water instead sheets off roofs, roads, parking lots and other IC directly into surface water. 
It carries with it whatever toxins are on those surfaces. The  greater the percentage of IC the  lower  the 
water quality.  
 
Maine’s Department of Environment Protection has documented this problem through the report of 
impaired waters it compiles to meet federal and state law. A ccording to the most recent report , 472 miles 
of riv ers and streams are impaired by nonpoint source pollution (NPS is  pollution that does not flow 
through pipes or other conveyances), 116 by unspecified urban stormwater, 49 by parking lot runoff, 38 by wet weather discharges (stormwater and combined storm and sewer water known as CSOs), 35 by habitat modification, 32 by erosion and sediment (often caused during construction), 19 by airports, and 9 by NPS wet weather discharges.  Unspecified urban stormwater impairs  another 11,535 acres of lakes.
1 
These are j ust some of the impairments related to stormwater from the report.  
 To address  part of  this problem Maine has created an IC -TMDL,
2 which set forth the amount of 
impervious cover that must be reduced or treated along im paired urban streams to restore water  quality. 
There are many other waterways impaired by stormwater pollution that are covered by other TMDLs or 
by none at all.  The  solutions  to these problems  will be cost ly and will fall largely to municipalities to 
address.  Most municipalities have lean budgets with tough competing priorities  and no permit (only 30 
of Maine ’s 483 municipalities are covered by the  MS4 permit) requiring them to restore water quality . 
Moreover, they do not have the tax base to spread costs to commercial ventures or charge stormwater 
utility fees. Portland is the only city that currently assesses such a fee.  
 
The Solution: Maine must have stricter regulations and allocate funds to a ddress stormwater pollution. 
Our economy depends upon clean, healthy waters. LD 1570 provides a good start. Now or in  future 
years, the legislature should increase the funds payable into this fund through bonds or other means. The 
bill language also should make  clear that the fund will prioritize infrastructure that conveys and  treat s 
stormwater .  
 
We request  you vote that LD 1570 O ught T o Pass. Thank you for considering our comments.  
 
Respectfully submitted,

2 https://attains.epa.gov/attains -public/api/documents/actions/MEDEP/42495/107074 . For impaired waters, the state must set 
a Total Maximum Daily Load  (TMDL)  for the pollutant s causing the impairment , establish  reduction target s to get to that 
healthy level and allocate  load reductions  to contributing sources  to restore water quality  to the level set by the TMDL . The 
IC-TMDL requires reductions in IC as a proxy for re ducing the pollutants.
