LD 224
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance
and Financial Services Committee,
I'd like to begin by thanking Rep Zager for sponsoring LD 224.  I heartily support this
bill.  I have been a physician for 39 years and have lived and practiced in Maine since 
2000.  Given my many years in medicine, I have been witness to the growth of the 
MOC process and disheartened by its cost and needless complexity. The complexity 
relates not to learning clinical material but rather the rules for completing and 
reporting MOC.  
I agree with Dr. Abreu that this bill is a win for all parties, except those who write the MOC 
learning materials and then sell them to us!
I agree also that a more flexible approach to MOC in Maine would be a significant draw to 
young physicians considering moving to our beautiful state.
Thank you for the work you do for us in the legislature.
Best,
Sarah Davy Muscat MD
