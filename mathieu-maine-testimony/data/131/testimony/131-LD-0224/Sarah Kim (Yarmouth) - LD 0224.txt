I am a psychiatrist and the medical director of behavioral health at a large primary 
care practice in Southern Maine. Most of our patients need to stay within their 
insurance networks to obtain mental health treatment. Finding psychiatrists who 
participate in network with insurance is exceedingly difficult due to clinically 
inappropriate restrictions on care, spurious denials of claims, time and energy needed 
to obtain payments for services rendered, and inadequate reimbursement rates. 
Mainers would be served well by the legislature explicitly preventing carriers from 
creating yet another barrier for patients to overcome  to access mental health services. 
It is very hard to find psychiatrists willing to participate in insurance networks; it 
would not be in Mainersâ€™ best interest  to permit payers to have another reason to 
deny coverage.
