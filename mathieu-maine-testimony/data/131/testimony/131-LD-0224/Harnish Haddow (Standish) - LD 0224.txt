Testimony in support: 
LD 224, “An Act to Strengthen Maine's Health Care Workforce by Preventing Discrimination by 
Requiring Maintenance of Certification for Insurance Reimbursement"

Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Services Committee, my name is Hamish Haddow. l am a Psychiatrist in Maine, andI 
am licensed by the Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine, as are all MD‘s. DO's (an equivalent 
degree) are licensed by the Board of Osteopathic Medicine. We are required to re-license every 
3 years, and must prove 150 hours of continuing medical education (CME) over those 3 years. 
This is independent of the additional requirements imposed by the American Board of 
Psychiatry and Neurology, through which I am also certified; it may come as no surprise that the 
ABPN Maintenance of Certification (MOC), which is currently a requirement by many insurers 
for coverage, charges substantially more than the Maine BOLIM. 
I have just completed my first certification through the ABPN, following my graduation from 
residency last year. At that time I took a certification exam, which is independent of the 
additional requirements for MOC. Ongoing examination to ensure competence is most 
appropriate, and I participate in this most willingly understanding that this is part of how we keep 
our workforce up to date and competent; I am disturbed by the fact that most non-physician 
providers do not have to take an exam to prove competence over time as we do. However, in 
addition to the exam, I am required to complete CME that comes directly from the ABPN, and 
for which I have to pay the ABPN. The CME I do for my licensure does not count toward this 
requirement. While continuing education is a pillar of medical practice, and all physicians of 
good conscious are engaged in constant ongoing learning and self-betterment, this practice by 
specialty licensing boards is redundant to the practices already in place through BOLIM and 
healthcare institutions, and serves primarily to generate large amounts of revenue on behalf of 
the specialty boards. While business are certainly entitled to make a profit, this profit comes at 
the cost of substantial time and expense that could be better used in the pursuit of direct patient 
care, the reason most of us are in medicine in the first place. If the money and time used for 
CME is spent on MOC through specialty boards, this limits the capacity of physicians to attend 
conferences and educational programs that are of interest to them, and provide new skills and 
knowledge a community needs. This risks obvious impacts to the overall health of our 
communities, both directly in lost time and distracted focus and indirectly through the early 
retirement of physicians who grow tired of this unnecessary and repetitive activity that seems 
less motivated by patient outcomes than profit. 
Moral injury in the field of medicine has taken a substantial toll on the workforce in recent years; 
I see this both in my colleagues and in my patients. Most physicians take pride in the parts of 
their work that still involve direct patient care, but this proportion seems to be dwindling as an 
increase in ancillary tasks builds. We know that doing the work that fuels us tends to combat 
moral injury, and helps in physician retention; and engaged physician who can focus on their
