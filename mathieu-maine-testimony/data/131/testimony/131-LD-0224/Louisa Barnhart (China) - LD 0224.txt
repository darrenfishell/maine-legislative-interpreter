Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee,
This week I had to catch up on continued medical education to renew my medical license. I 
wanted to also fulfill my MOC criteria at the same time. I had to join a medical academy to 
have access to their CME which was MOC approved. Then I had to pay for the course as 
well. Because they had no available tech help, I had to abandon this course of study, $250 
later. I had to start all over and seek another. This one had good tech support and costs $149
for 8.5 hours.  I'm going to need 20 more hours. In addition to all this one pays the Board 
$175  a year.  It all adds up. 
Numerous times in this process this week, I asked myself if this misery was worth it.  
The rigid rules prevent me due to its time drain from seeking education in directions 
that I feel lacking and interest me. I think this process substantially increases burnout 
because it's miserable and full of questions designed to trip one up. Who needs 
this???? 
Please support LD 224
