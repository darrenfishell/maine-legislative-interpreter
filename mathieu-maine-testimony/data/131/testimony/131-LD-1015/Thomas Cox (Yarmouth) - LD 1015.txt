Re: LD 1015--Resolve, Establishing the Commission to Study the Foreclosure Process 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonan and Members of the Committee: 
I offer this testimony in opposition to LD 1015. 
I am a private attorney who represented financial institutions for over 30 years 
before devoting the last 15 years of my legal work primarily to providing free legal 
representation to low-income Maine homeowners facing foreclosure. I have handled 
many hundreds of Maine foreclosure cases over the past 45 years, both for banks and for 
homeowners. My foreclosure defense work in 2010 exposed the national Robo-Signing 
Scandal which led in 2012 to the $25 billion National Mortgage Settlement between state 
and federal agencies and the nation’s national banks and mortgage servicers intended to 
halt their fraudulent and deceptive foreclosure practices. I have provided legal education 
in foreclosure work to thousands of lawyers across the country in seminars promoted by 
the National Consumer Law Center, the Practicing Law Institute, the American Bar 
Association, and others. I have participated in over 25 appeals of foreclosure cases in the 
Maine Supreme Court and the First Circuit Court of Appeals. My work in representing 
homeowners in foreclosure cases has resulted in my receiving awards from the Maine 
Bar Foundation, Boston University School of Law, the State Bar of New York, and the 
$100,000 Purpose Prize from Encore.org. 
My extensive experience in working in the Maine foreclosure process tells me 
that there is no need for the appointment of a new commission to study the Maine 
foreclosure process for the reasons discussed below. 
I. The Maine Foreclosure Process is Working Appropriately and Provides 
Critical Protections to Maine Homeowners. 
In the fourteen years since the 2008 financial crisis, the Legislature and the 
Judicial Branch have made multiple changes to the Maine foreclosure process. In 2009, 
they started the foreclosure mediation program highly successful in helping to save 
hundreds of Maine home from foreclosure. The program became a model for similar 
programs in other states.

In 2013, when there were multiple foreclosure bills pending before this 
committee, then Attorney General Janet Mills conducted a thorough study of Maine’s 
foreclosure laws which resulted in the production of the Attorney General Janet Mills’ 
Foreclosure Report, That report clariﬁed the need to preserve existing laws which protect 
Maine homeowners from rushed or flawed foreclosure actions. She did not ﬁnd any need 
for a wholesale revision of the Maine foreclosure process. Nothing in that report 
suggested that acceleration of the Maine foreclosure process would result in the 
production of more affordable housing in Maine. The report had several 
recommendations for the Ofﬁce of the Attorney General, the Judiciary, the Lenders and 
Servicers, and the Legislature. A number of them have been implemented. Possibly 
further action could be taken on those which have not been implemented, but nothing has 
happened since the issuance of the Mills report to suggest there is now a need for a new 
commission to study the Maine foreclosure process 
II. Alleged Delays in Completions of Maine Foreclosures are Caused by the 
National Mortgage Servicers. 
A. The National Mortgage Servicers Do Not Sufﬁciently Incentivize 
Their Lawyers to Expedite the Completions of Foreclosure. 
There are two distinct approaches to handling Maine foreclosures. The approach 
followed by the Maine based banks and credit unions produces quicker foreclosures with 
far fewer delays and errors. The approach followed by the national mortgage servicers 
and their lawyers produces constant and substantial delays in completions of foreclosure 
cases and many court decisions resulting in judgments against the foreclosure plaintiffs. 
The Maine based banks and credit unions account for less than 20% of the 
foreclosure volume in Maine. They hire good quality Maine lawyers and pay them fairly 
and reasonably for their work. Their cases progress without delays and rarely do courts 
ﬁnd fault with them. 
The national mortgage servicers, accounting for over 80% of Maine foreclosure 
cases, rely primarily upon law ﬁrms based outside of the State of Maine whose only work 
is handling foreclosures on a volume basis across multiple states. In uncontested cases, 
the servicers pay those law ﬁrms a flat fee sum for each case. That incentives those law 
ﬁrms to hire few lawyers and many non-lawyer assistants to process the cases to reduce 
the lawyer time involved and to maximize the proﬁt earned on each flat-fee case. For 
example, one of the most active out-of-state foreclosure ﬁrms operating in Maine hasa 
ratio of over eight employees to one lawyer. The lawyer is stretched thin by having to 
handle a high volume of court activity, thus resulting in little supervision of the 
paperwork being created by the non-lawyers back in the ofﬁce and constant needs to seek 
court delays of pending cases. Another result is frequent errors in these cases resulting in 
court denials or delayed processing of foreclosure claims, and delays resulting from re- 
ﬁlings of those claims.
2r
tE 
B. The National Servicers and Their Lawyers Fail to Use Available Civil 
Rules to Prosecute their Foreclosures More Quickly. 
The great majority of foreclosure cases are not contested, meaning there will be 
no homeowner dispute of the facts which must be proved. Those are ideal cases for ﬁling 
motions for summary judgment early and the avoidance of trials. The lawyers for Maine 
based banks and credit unions recognize that and routinely ﬁle motions for summary 
judgment. The lawyers for the national servicers _n_q\_1_er file motions for summary 
judgment because (a) preparing such motions requires care and diligence which cannot be 
provided by the non-lawyer employees, (b) such motions take longer to prepare than does 
the lavvyer’s attendance at an uncontested 20-minute trial, meaning there is less proﬁt for 
that fiat-fee law ﬁrm if it moves for summary judgment. The result here is that the Maine 
based bank or credit union can move a foreclosure case through a Maine court ona 
motion for summary judgment in probably half the time that the lawyers for a national 
servicer will take to process a case where they must await an assignment on a trial list. 
C. The National Mortgage Servicers and Their Lawyers Carelessly 
Cause Delays in Foreclosures. 
1. The Foreclosure Plaintiffs Do Not Diligently Prosecute Their 
Cases. 
The foreclosure mill law firms hired by the national servicers operate on a volume 
basis, handling as many cases as possible with the least possible amount of lawyer time 
devoted to each case. The few lawyers hired by the foreclosure mill firm must cover 
many cases across multiple courts and often face conﬂicting hearings and the need for 
motions to continue cases or seek orders allowing them to seek extensions of court 
deadlines. A perfect example of this came just ten days ago in the order attached as 
Exhibit A,‘ where the court severely admonished that foreclosure mill lawyer and her 
ﬁrm, stating that she “and her firm have a long and troubled history of failing to comply 
with Court deadlines and have been admonished repeatedly ” and were engaged in 
“dilatory conduct. ” The 20% of Maine foreclosures handled by the lawyers for the 
Maine based banks and credit unions do not engage in this conduct, but it is not at all 
unusual in the cases handled by the lawyers for the national mortgage servicers. 
2. The Foreclosure Plaintiffs D0 Not Utilize Statutes Allowing 
them to Expedite Foreclosure Cases. 
In 2013, the bankers asked the Legislature to amend the foreclosure laws to allow 
an expedited foreclosure process for properties abandoned by homeowners. The law they 
asked for was enacted as Ch. 521 in the 2013 Legislature and became 14 M.R.S. 6326 
entitled “Order of abandonment for residential properties in foreclosure. ” While I have 
seen occasional use of this statute by Maine based financial institutions, I have never seen

v  
the statute used by the lawyers for the national servicers to expedite foreclosures of 
vacant properties. 
Two years later, in 2015, the Maine ﬁnancial institutions asked this Committee to 
implement a recommendation in the 2014 Attorney General Janet Mills’ Foreclosure 
Report by enacting Ch. 243 of the 2015 Legislature entitled “An Act to Expedite Final 
Hearings in Certain Foreclosure Cases.” That statute, now appearing at 14 M.R.S § 6321- 
B was used in a few cases after 2015, but I have seen no use of it at all by the lawyers for 
the national mortgage servicers for the past 5 years. 
3. The Foreclosure Plaintiffs File Motions Which Delay Cases. 
Over the years, the banking community has regularly complained that the Maine 
foreclosure process is being unduly prolonged by the courts. By 2015, the Judicial 
Branch responded to those charges by showing it was the foreclosing banks and servicers 
who were delaying cases. In connection with what was then LD 846, and which became 
enacted as 14 M.R.S. 6321-B, the Judicial Branch submitted to this Committee the data 
shown on Exhibit B. That data showed that, on average, foreclosure cases in which 
neither party ﬁled a delay motion, such as a motion stay a case or to continue a trial or 
hearing, were being completed in 264 days. However, in cases where delay motions 
were ﬁled, the average completion time was 474 days--an increase of over 200 days per 
case often resulting from multiple delay motions being ﬁled. 
The Judicial Branch then determined which parties were responsible for these 
delay motions. Its data showed that it was the foreclosure plaintiffs who were ﬁling these 
motions in 81.5% of the cases, and the defendants were ﬁling them in only 11.7% of the 
cases. The court decision attached as Exhibit A and discussed in the Subsection 1 above 
illustrates this delay activity. 
Our experience in the foreclosure process since the Judicial Branch produced this 
revealing data, leads us to believe that the situation remains about the same. By refusing 
to use the summary judgment process, the lawyers for the national servicers face constant 
logistical challenges in getting witnesses to trials, thus often requiring filing motions for 
continuances. In many foreclosure cases managed by the national mortgage servicers, 
cases do not even get put on trial list for years due to their lawyers ﬁling repeated 
motions to stay those cases. As an example, recently I was asked to handle a foreclosure 
case ﬁled in the York District Court in 2018 which has lingered there for four years while 
the foreclosure plaintiff has repeatedly ﬁled motions to stay the case and has done 
nothing to move it to conclusion? 
2 Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. O'Brien, YORDC-RE-18-41 (York District Court)

4. The Lawyers for the National Servicers File Cases Which are 
Flawed. 
Exhibit C to this letter has a description of a pending foreclosure case arising out 
of a default that occurred 14 years ago.3 In the Raymond case, the homeowner lost his 
job in the summer of 2009 and had to vacate the house and move out of state to ﬁnd other 
employment. Bank of America, as servicer for Fannie Mae took possession of the house 
in 2009, but over the following 13 years, this house sat empty and deteriorating while the 
servicers brought one flawed foreclosure action after another--four in all, and even the 
fourth case is fatally ﬂawed. In May of 2022, the property had deteriorated to the point 
where the City of Sanford declared the building to be unsafe and dangerous and caused it 
to be demolished. There is no excuse for the failure of the lawyers, hired by Bank of 
America back in 2010, to have properly completed a foreclosure back then, or for the 
repeated failures of the lawyers for the national services to have completed the 
foreclosure process in the following 13 years. The loss of this house was not due to any 
flaw in the Maine foreclosure process but was entirely the result of egregious failures of 
the lawyers hired by the national services to competently and diligently handle the 
foreclosures. 
III. Conclusion. 
The foreclosure process in Maine was thoroughly studied by than Attorney 
General Janet Mills who involved all stakeholders in her review process. Detailed 
recommendations were made, and many were implemented. The COVID-19 pandemic 
greatly disrupted the entire Maine judicial process, and the Judicial Branch is working 
hard to return to nonnal. That unfortunate event, which has affected all types of litigation 
in Maine, not just foreclosures, does not justify the appointment now of a new 
commission to study the Maine foreclosure process. If they chose to do so, the national 
mortgage servicers can (and indeed should) review their own practices in the Maine 
foreclosure process to bring to an end their systematic failures to conduct their 
foreclosures competently and diligently.

Defendant 
ORDER 
The deadline for DLJ Mortgage Capital, Inc., to serve its complaint on 
Jason A. M. Holland was March 6, 2023, which was ninety days after DLJ initiated 
this foreclosure action. See ECF No. 1; Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). That deadline came and 
went without DLJ ﬁling any proof of service on Holland or even requesting an 
extension of time to do so, which prompted this Court to issue an order to show cause. 
See ECF No. 6. In response to the order to show cause, DLJ filed a motion claiming 
that Holland is evading service and seeking an additional forty-five days to serve him. 
See ECF No. 7. 
DLJ is represented by Attorney Reneau J. Longoria of the law firm of Doonan, 
Graves & Longoria, LLC. Attorney Longoria and her ﬁrm have a long and troubled 
history of failing to comply with this Court’s deadlines and have been admonished 
repeatedly. See, e.g., U.S Bank Tr., N.A. v. Cousins, No. 2:22-cv-00323-JAW, 
2023 WL 2561579, at *1-2 (D. Me. Mar. 17, 2023) (rec. dec.) (recommending dismissal 
after Attorney Longoria failed to respond to an order to show cause and noting that

her “complete indifference to this Court’s deadlines and orders” is “frustrating ” 
because, among other things, “it creates a great deal of unnecessary work for the 
Court”); Fed. Nat? Mortg. Ass’n v. Butler, No. 1:19-cv-00218-JAW, ECF No. 73

Cause. Once again, [the plaintiff] has failed to ﬁle proof of service of the Amended 
Complaint on [the defendant], , . . The Court will issue no further Orders to Show 
Cause in this case. As the Court has stated multiple times in this matter, the Clerk’s 
Office is not responsible for [the plaintiffs] compliance with Court deadlines and will 
not act as her administrative assistants. ” (cleaned up)); Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. 
Yardley, No. 1:19-cv-00187-LEW, ECF No. 54 (D. Me. June 28, 2021) (“In this case, 
the Clerk[’]s Office has issued fog; Orders to Show Cause. Plaintiff has serially 
failed to file a motion for entry of default judgment . . . . Counsel has been admonished 
repeatedly that if no motion were timely ﬁled, the Court would dismiss Plaintiff[ ’]s 
case for lack of prosecution. The Court, remarkably, has granted 11 motions to extend 
time to file a motion for default judgment . . . . To date, the Court has not received a 
Motion for Default Judgment. Counsel is reminded that the Court[’]s staff does not 
exist to provide auxiliary support to his own staff to remind him of his ﬁling 
obligations, to call to remind him when he has failed to meet his ﬁling obligations, 
which result in a cascade of Orders to Show Cause and motions to extend time. 
The Court will not manage this or any other case by a series of Orders to Show Cause, 
and the ensuing carousel of motions for mercy and more time.” (cleaned up)). 
According to data compiled by the Clerk’s Office, from January 1, 2019, to the present,
2     
Case 1:22-cv-00376-NT Document 9 Filed O3/24/23 Page 3 of 4 Page|D #1 86 
this Court has issued approximately 160 orders to show cause in foreclosure cases 
where Doonan, Graves & Longoria, LLC, represented the plaintiff. 
Enough is enough. Part of this “Court’s responsibility is to see that” its limited 
“resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests of justice. ” In re 
McDonald, 489 U.S. 180, 184 (1989). Having to continually issue orders to show 
cause and act on never-ending motions to extend time in cases involving 
Attorney Longoria and her ﬁrm most decidedly does not promote the interests of 
justice. Rather it is a tremendous waste of time that distracts this Court and its staff 
from important substantive work. 
So, here is what I am going to do. I will reluctantly GRANT DLJ’s motion 
(ECF No. 7), EXTEND the deadline for serving Holland to May 5, 2023, and 
TERMINATE the order to show cause (ECF No. 6). But I will not extend the deadline 
for service any further in this case, and Attorney Longoria and her firm are 
hereby_placed on notice thatbgoing forward, I will not grant any motion for 
extension of time filed by them in this or any other case after the deadline 
has already_passed absent truly extraordinary circumstances. See Gelin v. 
Shaman, 35 F/ith 212, 218 (4th Cir. 2022) (noting that good cause for failing to serve 
a defendant within the ninety-day time period prescribed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) 
requires a showing of diligence and that a failure to seek an extension of time before 
the deadline has lapsed tends to undercut any claim of good cause); Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 6(b) (“When an act may or must be done within a speciﬁed time, the court 
may, for good cause, extend the time . . . on motion made after the time has expired

inattention or carelessness, without more, normally does not constitute excusable 
neglect. ” (cleaned up)). 
Finally, to the extent that Attorney Longoria and her ﬁrm continue to engage 
in this sort of dilatory conduct, they should know that I may consider harsher 
penalties such as the imposition of monetary sanctions or the initiation of disciplinary 
proceedings.

Federal National Mortgage Association v. Raymond, 
SPRDC-RE-19-72 (Springvale District Court) 
SUMMARY OF DELAY EVENTS 
Raymond loses his job in summer 2009, vacates house in Sanford, notiﬁes servicer, Bank 
of America, that he is out of work and can no longer pay the mortgage. Bank of America 
takes control of the property. 
First Foreclosure Case is ﬁled in July 2010, Raymond does nothing to oppose it. Bank of 
America fails to prosecute the case for 1 ‘/2 years and dismisses it in February 2012 due to 
bank’s failure to obtain necessary assignment of mortgage. 
Second Foreclosure case commenced over a year later, in April 2013. Raymond does 
nothing to oppose it. The bank does nothing to prosecute it for almost 1 ‘/2 years and 
dismisses the case in July 2015 due to its failure to obtain necessary assignment. 
Fannie Mae delays for 15 months, then commences the Declaratory Judgment Suit in 
November 2016. Raymond does nothing to oppose it. Fannie Mae’s servicer fails to 
prosecute the case for over 3 years and dismisses it in December 2019. 
Third Foreclosure case is commenced by new Fannie Mae servicer in late 2019. Because 
Fannie Mae’s servicers have delayed for so long, causing the mortgage debt to climb 
from $175,000 in 2009 to over $3 80,000, Raymond opposes this foreclosure action. 
o The servicer for Fannie Mae repeatedly delays and stonewalls Raymond’s 
discovery efforts and takes no steps to advance the case. 
o In May 2022, the City of Sanford demolishes the house due to its becoming an 
unsafe and dangerous building due to the neglect of Fannie Mae’s sewicers. 
o In March 2023, Fannie Mae and the servicer agree to a settlement involving a 
consent to foreclosure by Raymond and a waiver by Fannie Mae of any remaining 
liability on the debt. 
Signiﬁcant issues: 
13 ‘/1 years from date of default to completion of settlement and consent foreclosure 
judgment 
Four lawsuits by the servicers, each of which is fundamentally flawed 
Failures by servicer ’s lawyers in each of four cases to prosecute the cases 
competently and diligently.
