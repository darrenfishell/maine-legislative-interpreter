UNIVERSITY OF MAINE SYSTEM 
University of Maine System Testimony Presented by Chancellor Dannel Malloy 
In Support of LD 460, An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Improve Student 
Success and Workforce Readiness Within the University of Maine System, April 26, 2023 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and distinguished members of the Joint Standing . 
Committee on Appropriations & Financial Affairs: My name is Dannel Malloy and I am the 
Chancellor of the University of Maine System (UMS). l am here to speak in strong support of the 
investment in Maine’s public university infrastructure proposed by LD 460, An Act to Authorize a 
Genera! Fund Bond Issue to Improve Student Success and Workforce Readiness Vl/ithin the 
University of Maine System. 
I would like to start by saying thank you. Yesterday, the University of Southern Maine opened its 
new nursing simulation lab that replicates both hospital and home care settings. This state-of- 
the-art, 6,000-square-foot facility will allow Maine's largest nursing education program to 
enhance hands-on healthcare workforce training and expand student enrollment by 20% to help 
address the state’s severe RN shortage. And it was made possible, in part, by public investment 
provided to our System through a 2018 general obligation (GO) bond approved by the 128"‘ 
Legislature and the people of Maine. At the same time USM was cutting their ribbon, l was up at 
the University of Maine at Fort Kent touring the new immersive nursing simulation lab under 
construction there using a share of the Maine Jobs & Recovery Plan funding awarded to UMS 
by Gov. Mills and the Legislature. This too will allow for expanded program enrollment and 
ensure UMFK nursing graduates have the skills to deliver safe, effective patient care. 
Later this summer, USM will also open a new 580-bed residence hall and Career & Student 
Success Center that will incorporate innovative mass timber construction. The project will 
transform USM’s Portland campus, the community and students ‘ readiness for the Maine 
workforce —providing much needed affordable housing that will make it easier for our students 
to stay in school to degree completion while incurring less debt and alleviating demand on local 
units. This project too was supported, in part, by the 2018 GO. bond. 
Our public universities ’ serious need for infrastructure investment is well known. More than half 
of UMS facilities and three-quarters of our residence halls have not been meaningfully 
renovated in at least 50 years. 
Many of you have heard me say before that beyond the region’s demographic challenges, the 
condition of our campuses is the biggest threat to Maine's workforce readiness and the 
sustainability of our System -— especially our rural campuses. According to an independent 
analysis (Gordian), our public universities are burdened by a backlog of deferred 
maintenance and imminent investment need that exceeds $1.6 billion, more than four 
times the combined need of Maine’s community college system and maritime academy. 
Today though, I want to focus on opportunity.

ln the cases of both the southern Maine nursing simulation and student housing projects, State 
support spurred significant private philanthropy. The same is true for the Ferland 
Engineering Education & Design Center that opened in 2022 at the University of Maine and will 
allow the System to deliver on our bold commitment to double our output of the engineers and 
computing professionals needed to power Maine’s economy. Ongoing annual appropriation for 
UMS debt service initiated by the Legislature in 2017 helped catalyze the capital campaign for 
that project, which then raised a record $25 million from more than 500 alumni, friends and 
corporate donors — including the single largest capital gift in UMaine’s history from Skowhegan 
native and mechanical engineering alumnus James Ferland, and his wife, Eileen. 
Most recently, the additional debt service appropriated to us by the 130"‘ Legislature has 
already been activated to support the renovation of 300 Fore Street in downtown Portland, 
where Maine’s only law school relocated this year to be closer to the courts and commerce. 
State funding was more than matched by private giving, including from the Harold Alfond 
Foundation, Bobby Monks and Bonnie Porta. Maine Law’s new home, which it shares with 
UMaine and USM academic, research and outreach programs, is already proving the power of 
modern facilities to attracting students and faculty. While applications to other New England law 
schools for fall 2023 admission are down 9%, Dean Leigh Saufley reports those to Maine Law 
are holding steady. 
Each of these projects supported great-paying construction jobs during the pandemic 
and will enable our universities to sustain and increase program enrollment, improve 
student success, meet the needs of Maine employers for more skilled workers and 
research-driven innovation, and benefit local communities. 
So too would the projects that would be made possible by additional State infrastructure 
investment, as proposed by LD 460, which has bipartisan support and was further endorsed by 
the Education & Cultural Affairs Committee in their budget report-back to you last month. 
The System would allocate new funds across all universities statewide as determined by capital 
condition data. Notably, our flagship UMaine, by far the largest of our campuses, would receive 
$58 million of a $100 million investment, with $23 million for USM and $7.8 million for the 
University of Maine at Farmington, by far the oldest of our campuses. 
I would like to tell you about several projects that we plan to pursue with these funds that 
demonstrate the depth and diversity of our need, and more importantly, the incredible impact 
infrastructure investment would have on the System, our students and this state. 
LD 460 would support the demolition of the infamous round building that formerly housed 
the law school, creating opportunity for redevelopment at the gateway of USM’s Portland 
campus while reducing our System’s overall square footage, energy usage, and 
operating and maintenance costs as part of my efforts to right-size our institutions ’ physical 
plant for the future. Over the past decade, we have taken hundreds of thousands of square feet 
of underutilized or obsolete space offline.

Across our System, we would also modernize residence halls, the availability and condition 
of which is among the top factors in student recruitment and retention — especially given 
the state‘s shortage of affordable housing — as well as student physical and mental health. 
Planned projects include roof and window replacements and upgrades to HVAC and other 
systems for Merriman and Emerson Halls at the University of Maine at Presque Isle and Scott 
Hall North and South at UMF —- none of which have been meaningfully renovated for at least 55 
years. 
Finally, infrastructure investment this year would allow us to break ground in 2024 at the R1 
UMaine for the Green Engineering & Materials Factory of the Future (GEM), which has 
already garnered $80 million, including from the U.S. Department of Defense. 
Utilizing artificial intelligence and arrays of massive 3D printers, this cutting-edge facility will 
enable the expansion of our Advanced Structures & Composites Center's world-leading 
workforce training, research and innovation into next-generation, large-scale biobased 
manufacturing process and materials development. Building off the success of UMaine’s 
BioHome3D made entirely from low-value wood fiber, the state’s vast, sustainable forest 
resources, and market opportunities for durable, low-cost construction materials, an entire bay 
of the 90,000-square-foot Factory of the Future would be focused on affordable housing R&D. 
Other applications advanced by GEM, and then commercialized by the private sector, would be 
clean energy, transportation and boat building, including for national security use.i 
Each of these projects represents tremendous opportunity for Maine: 
- To be more competitive against better-resourced institutions in New England and the nation 
so we can keep Maine’s best and brightest students here, bring new talent to our 
state, and grow the size and skill of the state’s workforce; 
0 To stabilize enrollment including at our rural campuses, on which local economies and 
communities are uniquely -dependent; 
Q To keep tuition costs and debt down, and support students to completion of their door- 
opening degrees; 
0 To attract private, philanthropic and other investment; 
0 To reduce our System’s footprint, fossil fuel usage and operating costs; and 
0 To leverage UMaine's R1 designation and solidify the state as a global leader in 
research and development that matters to Maine. 
The University of Maine System has demonstrated we deploy public infrastructure investment to 
provide the greatest return to taxpayers in the form of the talent and innovation necessary for 
Maine’s people and economy to prosper. 
We urge your support of LD 460 and thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
