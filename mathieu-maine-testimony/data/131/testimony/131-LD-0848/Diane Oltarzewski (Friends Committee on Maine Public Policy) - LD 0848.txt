Re: LD 848 An Act to Expunge Certain Nonviolent Drug Crimes 
 
For over 30 years, the Friends Committee on Maine Public Policy has held as core objectives the 
promotion of Restorative Justice and the amelioration of Tribal-State Relations.  
Today, we express our wholehearted support for LD 848. This bill will grant individuals the right 
and ability to see their records swept clean of any limiting taint of felony conviction, once they 
have served out their sentence and steered clear of problem behavior for five years.  
 
Such expungement will level the playing field and enable these individuals to compete in the 
marketplace based solely on their energy, ambition, skills and talents.   
 
The present moment finds us all caught in a rather absurd situation where a Class 1 drug can be 
legally purchased for recreation in any number of locations across the country. So there ceases 
to be any justification for continuing to cripple a personâ€™s opportunity to grow into useful 
employment, and play a constructive role in our society, merely because of prior and non-
violent possession of a drug.  
 
More than ever, we need a society peopled by individuals with hopeful prospects, not 
embittered alienation. Because this bill will help to foster such a society, we urge you to vote 
unanimously that LD 848 ought to pass. 
 
Thank you.
