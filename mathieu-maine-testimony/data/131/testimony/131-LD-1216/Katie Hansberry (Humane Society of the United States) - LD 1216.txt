An Act to Create the Animal Cruelty Task Force  
Committ ee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry  
April 3 , 2023  
 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and honorable members of the Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry , my name is Katie Hansberry and I am the Maine State 
Director of The Humane Society of the United States.  
 
On behalf of HSUS and our Maine supporters, I want to thank you for the opportuni ty to testify today 
in support of L D 1216 , which proposes a  new entity to assist with pro viding support and resources 
for the handling of animal cruelty cases.  
 
While Maine is a leader in animal protection laws, we continue to se e cruelty and neglect cases 
involving dozens o f animals all too frequently. Some recent examples include a case in Wales 
involving more than 100 cats, a cas e in Hampden invol ving more than 20 Great Danes, and  a case in 
Solon involving nearly 100 Collies.  
 
We are very fortunate to have the Animal Welfare Program and a statute requiring munici palities 
have an anima l control  officer, but many of th ose animal control  officers  are covering numerous 
towns with very limited resou rces. The proposed task force could provide necessary support , 
resources , and training  to animal control officers responding to more egregious or difficult cases 
while also possibly providing  an earlier intervention to help address concerning situations before they 
get to the point of requiring a large -scale seizure.   
 
We are gr ateful for this committee â€™s recognition of the  importan ce of providing resou rces to assist 
with the enforcement of Maine strong animal protection laws , such as the passage of LD 1744 last 
session  to prov ide more funding to the Animal Welfare Program , and ask that you continue to build 
upon  and support such efforts . 
 
Thank you for your time and  consideration .
