LD 915 , Resolve, to Establish the Blue Ribbon Commission to Study the Organization of 
and Service Delivery  by the Department of Health and Human Services  
Before the Joint Standing  Committee on Health and Human Services  
 
Friday, May 12 , 2023  
 
Good morning, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and  Human Service s. I am Senator Craig Hickman , representing 
10 towns and 2 cities in Southern Kennebec County, and I am here to express my support for LD  
915, titled "Resolve, to Enhance Service Delivery by the Department of Health and Human 
Services ." 
 
The current state of DHHS demands our attention and calls for transformative action. We have 
an opportunity to reevaluate and improve the organization and service delivery within the 
department. LD 915 proposes the establishment of a Blue Ribbon Commission, co mprising 
experts and stakeholders, to comprehensively study DHHS's operations and draw insights from 
successful models  employed by other states. By examining how other states structure their health 
and human services agencies and deliver crucial services, we can adopt proven best practices and 
tailor them to meet the unique needs of Maine. This approach ensures that we learn from the 
successes and failures of others, avoiding unnecessary pitfalls and accelerating the 
implementation of effective solutions.  
 
The proposed Blue Ribbon Commission allows for an in -depth analysis of DHHS's challenges 
and the identification of opportunities for improvement. It is crucial that we allocate sufficient 
time and resources for this endeavor to ensure thorough research and  thoughtful 
recommendations. LD 915 provides a reasonable timeframe for the commission to convene, 
gather data, and prepare comprehensive recommendations to guide the future of DHHS.  
 
The people of Maine, who rely on the services provided by DHHS, deserve the highest quality 
care and support. Furthermore, our taxpayers deserve efficient and effective delivery of these 
essential services. By enacting LD 915, we can foster positive change  within DHHS, leading to 
better outcomes for the individuals and families it serves.  
 
I urge you to vote in favor of LD 915. Thank you.
