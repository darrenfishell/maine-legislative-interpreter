We live in a time where many people think that if they don't like something, it should 
be banned, controlled, or cancelled. 
I believe that most Mainers would agree that we do not want to *increase* the amount
of unnecessary government regulation and control happening in our great state.
I understand that cannabis is not desirable to everybody, but that doesn't mean we get 
to control what our neighbors do.
The proposed bill is quite frankly - ridiculous. There are no arguments on the other 
side besides "I don't like it, therefore it should be banned."
When I smell cigarette smoke, it makes me feel physically ill. Others are bothered by 
the smell of meat on the grill and bonfires in their neighbors' yards.  Can you 
*imagine* a bill being passed that would outlaw smoking cigarettes or having a fire in
your OWN yard? What a gross violation of sovereignty and liberty that would be. 
Despite the physical revulsion I feel in response to cigarette smoke, I would never 
seek to violate my neighbors' freedom by outlawing them.
As with any other state, Mainers are hanging in the balance of a war on freedom.
What will we decide? In which direction will we move forward? 
Freedom - or control? 
Sovereignty - or a nanny state? 
The seemingly small decisions like that of this bill are the ones that propel us in one 
of those directions or the other. I invite you to take seriously any infringement of our 
rights, any attempt at controlling what law abiding citizens are allowed to do on their 
own properties. I invite you to make the right choice - the one that doesn't impose 
your own opinions on every single other person.
Thank you for your time
