LD 410
I am against LD410. I believe that it is reverting back in time from already passed 
legislation. Also, thereâ€™s no way to determine whether a plant is hemp or cannabis, 
which is a huge problem. There is no way to determine whether the smell would be 
coming from a hemp cigarette or a cannabis cigarette. I am both shocked and appalled
at the legislation, especially seeing as senator cut way, has already brought forth very 
similar legislation in the past years, and it seems extremely redundant and a waste of 
time and taxpayer money.  This is a huge violation of our privacy, and I implore you 
to imagine what it would be like to be told you could not smoke in your own home in 
your own yard in your own private property.
