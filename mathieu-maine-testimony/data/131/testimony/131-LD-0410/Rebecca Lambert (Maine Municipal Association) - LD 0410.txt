Neither for Nor Against  
 
LD 410 - An Act Regarding the Nuisance of Cannabis Plants and Smoke in Residential Areas  
 
April 5 , 2023 
 
 Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, and I am providing testimony neither for nor against  LD 410 on 
behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee 
(LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Since this bill was originally a concept draft, the LPC has not yet taken a position. We appreciate 
the amendment that Rep. Caswell brought forth and plan to bring the measure  before our LPC  at our April 
11
th meeting.  
MMA will plan to submit additional testimony based on the  outcome of that discussion in advance 
of the work session. Thank you for your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
