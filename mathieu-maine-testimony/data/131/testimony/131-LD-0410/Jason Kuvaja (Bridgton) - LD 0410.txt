Jason Kuvaja
Bridgton
LD 410
Good afternoon Committee members,
My name is Jason Kuvaja of Bridgton, and I am submitting this testimony against LD 
410.
Firstly, this punitive and discriminatory bill goes against the spirit of Maine's 
cannabis laws. Laws that were directly enacted by the will of the people in 
referendum. 
This bill discriminatorily targets the cannabis industry and home grower for 
subjective "smells" while ignoring countless other Maine industries that routinely 
produce offensive odors as part of production. Farming, fishing (including lobsters), 
paper production, various mills and the list goes on. We do not penalize these 
industries, nor should we cannabis.
Cannabis farming helps save family farms from urban sprawl. Don't penalize and 
further encumber it. Farming is already hard work.
The smells associated with cannabis are only present during the mid and late 
flowering, effectively only a month or two. I can assure you from personal experience
growing up on a Maine farm, cannabis smells much less, and much less often than 
traditional animal farming.
I also believe that medicinal cannabis fits well within the recently enacted 
constitutional amendment  declaring that "all individuals have a natural, inherent and 
unalienable right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own 
choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being."
Are we going to fine farmers,fisherman and wharf shop owners? Perhaps an 
injunction against low tide while were at it? Certainly not as that would be as 
ridiculous as this proposal.
Finally, this is not an issue for the State, but rather for individual towns and cities 
planning and code boards.
Thank you for listening to my opinion.
