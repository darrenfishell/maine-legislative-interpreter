Eben Sumner
West Baldwin 
LD 410
Thank you Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and the esteemed Veteran and 
Legal Affairs Committee for the chance to testify against LD 410 today.
My name is Eben Sumner and I am from West Baldwin, Maine. I am here, speaking 
on behalf of myself, and as the president and legislative chair of the Maine Growers 
Alliance. I am also a founding member of the Cannabis Council of Maine, shaper 
participant in Seed2Health, and own and operate two businesses in the cannabis space
in Maine.
I absolutely disagree with this bill in its entirety. I feel that this bill, yet again singles 
out, Cannabis cultivators, program participants, and any Maine citizen exercising their
right to grow personal plants on their property. This bill provides a legal pathway for 
disgruntled persons to prohibit program stakeholders and Maine citizens, their right to
cannabis consumption, and to operate businesses.
Additionally, there are no other agricultural or manufacturing laws against the smell 
of any other industry. Let’s consider a paper mill and the odor it emits at an entirely 
massive scale. We can also consider every spring the spread of manure across all of 
our agricultural fields in the state. We have all experienced that two weeks of odor, 
seemingly erupting from every corner of our state. Let’s also consider the year-round 
odor that a pig farm, dairy farm, avian farm also emits. None of these agriculture or 
manufacturing industries are required to limit odor through statute.
We must also consider how vague and relative “smell” or “odor” is. There is no 
equipment, in my experience, that can quantify smell or odor  in such a way that a 
decibel meter quantifies noise or sound.
I urge you all to vote ought not to pass for LD 410.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit a written testimony. I am available to be 
contacted with any questions.
Best,
Eben Sumner
