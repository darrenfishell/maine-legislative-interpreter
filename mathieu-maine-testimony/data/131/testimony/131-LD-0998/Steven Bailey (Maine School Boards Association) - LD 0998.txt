TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 998  
 
AN ACT TO REMOVE THE COST -OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT  
FROM THE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Manage-
ment Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine 
School Boards Association, in opposition to L.D. 998.  
 
This bill sets the minimum wage at $13.80, which already is the current minimum 
under state law. It also removes the requirement that each January 1 the wage goes 
up by the increase in the cost -of-living. Removing the cost -of-living adjustment, as 
currently is in the law, puts our workers and families in financial jeopardy. As it is 
now, small businesses, schools and even larger businesses are having difficulty 
finding workers to employ. Keeping the minimum salary this low will certainly 
not help the economy move forward and will contribute to food insecurity, lack of 
secure housing, and family financial instability. Students who are working in the 
summer to pay for college will need more than the minimum and those who go 
straight to work after high school graduation, also will be disadvantaged.  
 
Our association is opposed to this bill because we believe it puts the state and our 
students at a disadvantage when the minimum wage does not increase. Given the 
circumstances within the state, this bill just doesn ’t make sense. MSBA urges the 
Committee to vote no on L.D. 998.
