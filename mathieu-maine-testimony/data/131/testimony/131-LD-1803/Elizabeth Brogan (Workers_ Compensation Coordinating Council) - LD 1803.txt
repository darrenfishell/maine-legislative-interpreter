Testimony in Support of LD 1803 
An Act to improve the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992 
May 2, 2023 
Presented by Elizabeth Brogan 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and distinguished members of the Labor 
and Housing Committee, my name is Elizabeth Brogan and I am the Executive 
Director of the Workers’ Compensation Coordinating Council and Maine Council 
of Self-insurers. My testimony is in support of LD 1803. 
This bill consists of a half dozen or so commonsense changes to the Maine 
Workers’ Compensation Act and represents collaborative efforts of Labor and 
Management at the Workers’ Compensation Board to update and simplify. If this 
bill becomes law, the predetermination process for independent contractors will 
be simpler and more convenient for everyone concerned; a formula for 
calculating and coordinating old-age, wage continuation, disability, pension or 
retirement benefits, will be vastly simplified and less confusing; outdated 
obligations on the part of the board will be eliminated; and employer form-filing 
obligations will be clarified. 
Thank you. lam happy to take any questions.
