LD 1803 - An Act to Improve the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992
Addressing the Chairperson and committee. The Workers' Compensation Act of 1992 
has been serving the employers and the employees well. I do not agree with all of the 
contents of this Act and believe this amended Act would destroy the will of business 
people to employ workers. I own my business and operate alone, because laws, 
regulations and financial cost to employ workers. Entrepreneurs are operating at a 
smaller size due to the legal risks, poor economy and new laws crippling business. 
LINDA HASKELL, OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
