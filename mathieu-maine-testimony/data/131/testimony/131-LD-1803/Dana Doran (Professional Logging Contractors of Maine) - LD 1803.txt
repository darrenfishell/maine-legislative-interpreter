       Testimony of  DANA A. DORAN Executive Director Professional Logging Contractors of Maine  Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and House, In Support of LD 1803, An Act to Improve the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992  Tuesday, May 2, 2023  Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, my name is Dana Doran, and I am the Executive Director of the Professional Logging Contractors of Maine. The Professional Logging Contractors of Maine (PLC) is a trade association that represents logging and associated trucking contractors throughout the state of Maine. The PLC was formed in 1995 to give independent contractors a voice in a rapidly changing forest industry.   As of 2021, logging and trucking contractors in Maine employed over 3,000 people directly and were indirectly responsible for the creation of an additional 2,500 jobs.  This employment and the investments that contractors make contributed $582 million to the state’s economy.  Our membership, which includes 200 contractor members and an additional 120 associate members, employs more than 75% of the individuals who work in this industry and is also responsible for 80% of Maine’s annual timber harvest.   Thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify on behalf of our membership in support of LD 1803, An Act to Improve the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992.  We have reviewed the proposed legislation and have also discussed it with Mr. Rhode from the Maine Workers’ Compensation Board, and we are supportive of the changes that are included in this legislation.  None of the proposed changes will have a detrimental impact on the current system for sole proprietors to obtain predetermination and in fact will likely make the system more efficient with respect to the establishment of relationship that contractors have with small landowners before a timber harvest takes place. For these reasons, we urge the Committee to vote Ought to pass.         Thank you for your time and attention to this matter and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
