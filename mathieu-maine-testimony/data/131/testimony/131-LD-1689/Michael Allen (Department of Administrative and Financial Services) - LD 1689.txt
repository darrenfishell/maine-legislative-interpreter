 TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Hearing Date: Tuesday, May 9, 2023, 1:00 PM 
  
L.D. 1689 – “An Act to Exempt Prescription Pet Medications from Sales Tax” 
 
 
 Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee – good afternoon, my name is Michael Allen, Associate Commissioner 
for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  I am 
here today at the request of the Administration to testify Against L.D. 1689, “An 
Act to Exempt Prescription Pet Medications from Sales Tax.” 
Current law exempts medicine and antibiotics for animals from the sales tax 
when used in animal agricultural production.  If the Committee chooses to move 
forward with this proposal, it should be amended to exempt medications for pets 
when “sold pursuant to a veterinarian’s prescription,” or “by someone licensed to 
practice veterinary medicine under Title 32, Chapter 71-A.”  In our view, however, 
this bill erodes the sales tax base and does not meet the necessity of life criteria 
often used as a policy justification for sales tax exemptions.   
The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.
