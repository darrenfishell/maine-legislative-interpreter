RE: Testimony  in SUPPORT  of LD 301, An Act to Exempt Employers from Providing Earned 
Paid Leave for Certain Employees  
Dear Senator Tipping , Representative Roeder  and members of the Labor and Housing  
Committee : 
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO  of the Retail Association of Maine. I 
am a resident of Topsham.  We have more than 350  members statewide and represent retailers 
of all sizes.  Maine’s retailers employ more than 80,000 Mainers.  I am submitting the testimony 
in support of LD 301. 
 
LD 301 would exempt part -time and temporary retail em ployees from Maine ’s earned paid 
leave law. As many pe ople are aware, r etailers of ten hire additional temporary help during bus y 
times of year like the Christmas holidays. For garden centers, their busy time of year is Spring. 
For candymakers, it could be Valenti ne’s Day. Regardless of when it happens, temporary hires 
are part of the business, and the person being hired is aware that it is a temporary posit ion, and 
is not ex pected to endure. The record  keeping of earned time for temporary positions is 
significant, and this exemption would  be helpful . 
 
We do n ot support the exemption of part -time employees. Although they are not working full -
time hours, we are fine with them continu ing to earn pro -rated earned paid leave as provided 
by the Maine law. However , because part-time work are often year -round employees, we feel 
they differ from te mporary employees.  
 
Thank you for the consideration of our comments . 
 
Curtis Picard, CAE  
President and CEO
