LD 1122
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation, my name is.Mary Jensen nd I'm from Dayton,
Maine and I am here today to speak in support of LD 1122 Resolve, to Rename 
Bridges in the Town of Cornish.  
I think it is a simple and inexpensive way to remind young and old of the heroes who 
serve our country.  We live busy lives and sometimes forget to appreciate those who 
have made our way of life possible.  Crossing over these bridges and having the signs 
catch our eye would be an excellent way for the three people/groups honored by this 
simple act to be remembered and reflected upon.
