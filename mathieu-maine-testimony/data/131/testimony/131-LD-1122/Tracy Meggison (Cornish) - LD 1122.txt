LD 1122
Good Afternoon.
My name is Tracy Meggison and I wish to express my support for LD 1122.
I am a lifelong resident of Cornish and I think this would be a great way to honor 
those who have not only sacrificed so much for our freedoms and liberties but 
continue to do so.
This would also be a great way to put Cornish on the map and would attract many 
tourists which would only benefit the town.
Appreciate your time in this matter and let's make it happen and show respect to so 
many who gave so much of themselves and to those who still do.
Thanks!
