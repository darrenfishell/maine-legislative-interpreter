Dear Senators  Chipman, Representative Williams, and honorable members of the 
joint standing committee on transportation: 
My name is Lana Roberts.  I am a former resident of the Cornish/Limington area.  In 
the interest of my friend, Calista Cross, I write this letter in support of LD1122 
Resolve to rename bridges in the town of Cornish.   
The three bridges of Cornish that I am in support of renaming include: 
1. The bridge located on Depot Road, Cornish, Maine and crosses the Saco 
River.  The chosen rename of this bridge would be “Veteran’s Memorial 
Bridge” and to be decorated with US flags to honor the POWs and veterans 
of the Viet Nam war. 
 
2. The bridge located on Route 25, Cornish, Maine, located by Krista’s 
Restaurant.  The desired name would be “911 Memorial Bridge”, decorated 
with Hero flags on each side of the sign. 
 
3. The third bridge located on Route 5, Cornish, Maine would be renamed “ 
The Harriet Tubman Memorial Bridge” with flags of her on each side of 
sign. 
 
The reason for my support/interest in renaming the above said bridges is because I 
feel our veterans who fought for this country deserve to be recognized and honored 
far more than they are.  It is too late for those who did not return from the Viet Nam 
war.  For those who did return from that war, through no fault of their own, they 
were met with anger and disrespect.  Perhaps this small late token of appreciation 
can help to rectify the injustice.  I therefore pledge my written support. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
Lana Roberts
