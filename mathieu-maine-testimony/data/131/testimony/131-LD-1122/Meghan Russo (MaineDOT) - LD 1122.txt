Neither F or Nor Against  
 
LD 1122  
Resolve, to Rename Bridges in the Town of Cornish  
________________________________________ _____________________  
 
Senator Chipman , Representative Williams  and distinguished  members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, I am Meghan Russo , Legislative Liaison for the Maine 
Department of Transportatio n.  MaineDOT is neither for nor against LD 1122 , Resolve, to 
Rename Bridges in the  Town of Cornish.  
 
MaineDOT considers the naming of bridges, roadways, and other state transportation 
infrastructure to be within the purview of the Legislature. Simply put, we build them and you name 
them. Accordingly, we generally  do not take positions on so -called “naming bills .” However, we 
do submit written testimony regarding whether the particular infrastructure under consideration 
has been named before, and if so what those name(s) are. In this case, we are not aware of any 
previous legislatively -sanctioned names for these bridges . MaineDOT’s current inventory 
number s for these  structure s are 3859, 3024, and 3025 . 
 
We hope this information is helpful. Thank you.
