Renaming the bridges in Cornish would be a wonderful tribute to all the brave men 
and women who fought for the freedom of our country.  I what better way to show 
our appreciation and support for the military then by naming these bridges.  I myself 
had an uncle who was a prisoner of war and was raised in Cornish.   We really love 
and are thankful for all military personnel and hopefully the renaming of the bridges 
would bring some comfort to the families of those who were lost in wars and those 
who continue to fight.
