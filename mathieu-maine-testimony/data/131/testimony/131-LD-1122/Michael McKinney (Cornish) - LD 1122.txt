LD 1122
My name is Michael McKinney and I am from Cornish Maine. I am writing today to 
speak in support of LD 1122 to Rename Bridges in Cornish.  Name changes would 
include 9-11 memorial, Veterans Memorial and Harriet Tubman Memorial. 
 I believe it is vital that we preserve our history for generations to come and this bill 
does just that. We must never forget that dreadful day of September 11 when America
was attacked.  Renaming a bridge in Cornish will honor those first responders who 
made the ultimate sacrifice on that day and preserve the memories of loved ones lost. 
Veterans Memorial Bridge will honor those who served our great nation and Harriet 
Tubman Memorial Bridge would honor an abolitionist who lead America during a 
dark period in our history.
I ask that you vote in favor of this bill and thank you for your time.
