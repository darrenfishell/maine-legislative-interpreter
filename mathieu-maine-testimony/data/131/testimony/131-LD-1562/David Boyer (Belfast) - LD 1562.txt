LD 1562
I am opposed to LD 1562 as it is unduly restrictive in its definitions of key terms (e.g.
fiduciary, material, pecuniary, etc.) with the clear intent of prohibiting consideration 
of factors which bear upon the fullest meaning of those terms. Environmental, social, 
and governance factors must, of course, be considered in deciding whether a 
particular investment decision best protects the pecuniary interests of 
beneficiaries.The law as currently worded is sufficient to the task and supports 
considered judgment to be made with regard specifically to the question of divestment
of fossil fuels holdings. The more carbon that is burned the more damage is done to 
the environment, the more physical harm is done to the populations, and greater stress
is placed on the maintenance of effective governance. At some point, which I believe 
has already been reached, Maine PERS will be forced to decide that the fiduciary, 
material, and pecuniary interests of the beneficiaries require divestment of fossil fuels 
as quickly as is practicable. To do otherwise is to weaken the economic security of the
beneficiaries who will have to share in the shouldering of costs to repair the 
environment, to gain needed treatment for illness and injury occasioned by climatic 
changes and to support governmental costs in re=establishing  social stability. These 
judgments must not be denied overseers of investment funds by defining terms in 
such a way that only a "contextless" decision is possible.
