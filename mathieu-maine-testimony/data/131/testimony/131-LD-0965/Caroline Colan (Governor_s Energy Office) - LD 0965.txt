TESTIMONY BEFORE THE ENERGY, UTILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE 
An Act to Subsidize Hydroelectric Power 
L.D. 965 
GOVERNOR'S ENERGY OFFICE 
April 12, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology (EUT): My name is Caroline Colan, and I am the Legislative Liaison for the 
Governor's Energy Office (GEO). 
The GEO testifies in opposition to L.D. 965. 
Hydroelectric generation has been and continues to be an important resource in Maine's electricity mix, 
providing 27 percent of Maine's total electricity net generation in 2021, produced by 51 licensed 
hydroelectric power plants in the state with about 726 MW of total capacity? The Public Utilities 
Commission's latest report on RPS compliance which reports on 2021 activity, reported that 
hydroelectricity made up a significant portion of Maine's RPS including 81 percent of Class ll resources, 
and more than 12 percent of both Class l and Class IA resources, respectively? Additionally, small hydro 
represents about ten percent of operational capacity enrolled in net energy billing programs? 
The Maine Hydropower Study, published by the GEO in 2015, developed an inventory of existing and 
potential hydropower resources. It shows that most of Maine's hydroelectric potential has already been 
tapped, with approximately 56 MW of latent capacity for conventional development as of publishing. ‘ 
The GEO's 2021 Renewable Energy Goals Market Assessment additionally forecasts limited potential for 
new in-state hydro to play a major role in satisfying Maine's RPS requirements going forward? 
Considering the prevalence of hydroelectric power in Maine's energy landscape today, and the limited 
existing potential capacity remaining available for development in the state, the GEO does not seea 
need to provide new state-specific subsidies or incentives for hydroelectric power. However, there are 
significant new federal incentives for hydroelectric power plants that could be utilized for Maine-based 
hydro projects. 
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law authorized three hydro incentive programs “:

0 Hydroelectric Production lncentives (BlL provision 40331): Will provide $125 million in incentive 
payments to qualified hydroelectric facilities at a rate of 1.8 cents/kWh with a ceiling of $1 
million per facility. 
¢ Hydroelectric Efficiency lmprovement lncentives (BIL provision 40332); lnvests $75 million to 
enable upgrades to hydroelectric facilities to increase their efficiency by at least 3 percent. 
0 Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity lncentives (BIL provision 40333); lnvests $554 
million to enhance existing hydropower facilities for capital improvements directly related to 
grid resiliency, dam safety, and environmental improvements. 
The lnﬂation Reduction Act additionally provides several funding opportunities and incentives for 
hydropower in the form of production tax credits and loan financing. ’ Together, these federal programs 
offer opportunities for new hydroelectric power plants and to existing projects to increase their 
operational efficiency. 
ln sum, the GEO believes the existing suite of opportunities and supports available to hydroelectric 
power plant operators are sufficient. 
Thank you for your consideration.
