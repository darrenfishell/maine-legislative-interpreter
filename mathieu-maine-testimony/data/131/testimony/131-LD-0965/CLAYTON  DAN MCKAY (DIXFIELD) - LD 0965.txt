Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee
I swear the more bills entered for consideration, the dumber they get
Who do you know wants to pay more for something?
Any bill presented without even one word of why anyone should consider it serious 
should be chucked into the circular file. 
This is a waste of the people's money to allocate one second to discussing this 
"Concept"
I've already wasted too much of my time preparing this testimony!
