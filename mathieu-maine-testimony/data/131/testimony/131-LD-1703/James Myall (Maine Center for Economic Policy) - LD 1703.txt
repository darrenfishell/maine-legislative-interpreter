Testimony  in Support of LD 1703  “An Act to Amend the Maine Equal Pay Law by Prohibiting Pay 
Discrimination Based on Race ” 
 
Dear Senator Tipping, Rep resen tative Roeder, and members of the  Joint Standing Committee  on Labor 
and Housing. My name is James Myall. I ’m an economic policy  analyst at  the Maine Center for Economic 
Policy, and I ’m writing to you in support of LD 1703, “An Act to Amend the Maine Equal Pay Law by 
Prohibiting Pay Discrimination Based on Race .” MECEP s uppo rts LD 1703 because it will help to improve 
the w ages of  Black, L atino, Asian, and Indigenous  Mainers in our state, who are currentl y underpaid for 
a variety of re asons, including outright discrimination. LD 1703 will send a message that this 
discri mination is clearly unacceptable and help close the racial earnings gap.  
Pay discrimination on the basis  of ra ce or ethnicity is already  illegal  under  federal law ,i however, having 
this pro hibition laid out explicitly in state law would send a message to employers that the state takes 
this form of discrimination  seriou sly and it will not be tolerated.  Inclu sion in sta te law will also give the 
Maine Depar tment of Labor explicit authority to pursue offenders rather than relying on federal 
investigations.  
And despite the long -standing prohibition  against this practice in federal  law, it appears that some level 
of discrimination still o ccurs. For MECEP ’s State of Working Maine 2020 report,  we examined the 
average wages of Mainers from different racial and e thnic g roups with si milar educati on levels.ii We 
foun d that at every educ ation level, M ainers of color earned substantially  less t han t heir white 
counterparts.  We found that if the wage s for Mainers of Color were e quivalent to those of white 
Mainer s, their earnings would be a full $ 214 million extra every year.

There are man y factors that contribute to this disparity,  which the r eport examines in more detail , but 
they include lack of occupat ional segregation ; low er social capital for some isolated  racial  groups; 
discri mination in the criminal justice system which reduces employment op portunities; and disparities in 
educational  access due to  financial burden . Yet discrimination remains at least partly a factor in the low 
earnings and lack of employment  opportunities for non-white Mainers.  
It can be difficult to pinpoint th e precise extent of discrimination and t he impact it has on wages for 
people  of color. Nonetheless, all signs point to continued racial discrimination in t he workplace  playing a 
role in lower earnings f or people of color.iii Academic st udies which have exam ined the “racial wage 
gap” consistently  find some portion of the wage gap which cannot be explained by education, skill, 
experie nce, or occupation, suggesting the persistence of some kind of dis crimination. And personal 
experie nces corroborate  this. Nationally, Black Americans are five times as likely as white Americans, 
and Latinos are four times as likely , to report being treated unfairly regarding hiring, pay, or a promotion 
in the past year.iv 
LD 1703 will not solve the problem of the racial wage gap alone, but it will help us to make progress 
toward s a more equi table labor market for people of color. It wi ll help us live up to the promise that all 
Mainers deserve to be paid fairly for the work they do, and to  be free from d iscrimination based on race 
or ethnicity . I urge you to vo te “ought to  pass” on the legislati on.  
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I ’m happy  to answer any qu estions you may have and can be
