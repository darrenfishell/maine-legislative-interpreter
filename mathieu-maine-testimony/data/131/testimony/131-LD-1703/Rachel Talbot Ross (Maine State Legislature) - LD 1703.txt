SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
Tuesday, May l6th, 2023 
Testimony of Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross presenting 
LD 1 703 An Act to Amend the Maine Equal Pay Law by Prohibiting 
Pay Discrimination Based on Race 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor & Housing 
Good afternoon Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and other 
distinguished members of the Labor & Housing Committee. I am Rachel Talbot 
Ross and I represent House District l 18 which is the Portland neighborhoods of 
Parkside, Bayside, East Bayside, Oakdale and the University of Southern Maine 
Campus and I also have the distinct honor of serving as Maine Speaker of the 
House. I am here today to present LD 1703, An Act to Amend the Maine Equal 
Pay Law by Prohibiting Pay Discrimination Based on Race. 
LD 1703 will create an expanded protection against pay discrimination on 
the basis of race in the 2019 Maine Equal Pay Law. This means that if two people 
are equally qualiﬁed for the same job, with the only difference being their skin 
color, the employer may not pay one person more than the other. 
This bill will also prohibit an employer from instructing their employees of 
different races not to discuss their wages and prohibit an employer from inquiring 
about an applicant ’s pay history for the purposes of offering a lower wage. Finally, 
for the Department of Labor’s annual report to your committee on the progress of 
Equal Pay labor matters, LD 1703 will require that race be considered as a part of 
the annual report. 
According to US Census Bureau statistics, in Maine and in the United 
States, people who are white consistently have higher wages and lower 
unemployment rates than their Black, Latino and Native American neighbors. 
While white women face their own struggle with pay equity, earning only 82 cents 
to the dollar that a White man makes - Women of color face a much larger 
disparity. Black Women earn 64 cents to the dollar, Native American women earn 
60 cents to the dollar, and Hispanic Women earn 57 cents to the dollar.

Why does this happen? This is due to systemic and individual job 
discrimination — whether it is limited access to higher education, increased 
likelihood of involvement with the criminal justice system, cultural bias towards 
the name on top of a resume, or exclusion from social networks that advance 
employment prospects. 
Facing systemic barriers, women and men of color resort to taking jobs for 
which they are overquali ﬁed in order to provide for themselves and their families. 
According to the Urban Institute ’s 2017 study Mismatch: How Many Workers with 
a Bachelor ’s Degree Are Overquali ﬁed for Their Jobs? “were these college- 
educated Mainers able to get suitable work at the same rate as white Mainers, 
approximately 800 Mainers of color would earn an additional $47 million per 
year.” Tragically, millions of dollars of generational wealth are stolen away from 
the hard—earned labor of Mainers of color, perpetuating a cycle of poverty.

wage increases. 
With limited employment opportunities, Mainers of color are pushed into 
low wage positions with the higher likelihood of employers taking advantage of 
their labor in unsafe working conditions and longer hours away from their families. 
As reported in the National Women’s Law Center, “The Wage Gap Has Robbed 
Women of Their Ability to Weather COVID-19 ” — over the course of a 40-year
career, Black Women lose an estimated $964,400 to the wage gap, Native 
American women lose $986,240, Hispanic women lose $1,163,920. 
The earning potential leads to further complications as stated in the 
American Psychological Association study “Social Psychological and Personality 
Science” . Mainers of color face higher health risks with earning a lower rate of pay 
based of their skin color. Not only are people of color twice as likely to be food 
insecure as white Mainers, they are also more likely to have difﬁculty paying for 
health care leading to a lower life expectancy. These income gaps will also havea 
complicating effect on the mental stress of Mainers of color from increased 
feelings of competition, anxiety, and a general lack of trust between communities 
that can transform into more cultural division. 
Eliminating the income gap for men and women of color will provide 
immediate and certainly additional unforeseen benefits for all Mainers. 
While Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned 
compensation discrimination due to “race, color, religion, sex or national origin” —- 
that hasn’t stopped employers from paying men more than women, or people of 
color less. LD 1703 is a single measure working towards Mainers of color will earn 
the same paycheck as their colleagues. 
Currently, 13 other states have some variation equal pay protections or pay 
equity protections based on race — Alabama, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, 
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, & Wisconsin. 
In a news release for this year’s Maine Equal Pay Day, Labor Commissioner 
Laura Fortman succinctly stated," 
. . .while women in general have had to work 
until half-way through March to earn what men already earned in 2022, the reality 
is even starker for women of color.” LD 1703 is just one small step the Maine 
Legislature can take to help bring parity among a system that chooses to ignore the 
advancement of one group of people versus others. 
Thank you for time and attention. I am happy to take questions, but there are 
others that are more knowledgeable on the subject than I am that can be more 
helpful.
