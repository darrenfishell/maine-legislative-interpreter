In Support of LD 1703, 
An Act to Amend the Maine Equal Pay Law by Prohibiting Pay Discrimination Based on Race 
To the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing Public Hearing, 
Tuesday, May 16, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing. I am Mike Roland, Director of the Bureau of Labor Standards for the 
Maine Department of Labor (Department). lam here today to speak on behalf of the Department in 
support of LD 1703, An Act to Amend the Maine Equal Pay Law by Prohibiting Pay Discrimination Based 
on Race. 
Requirements regarding equal pay have been part of Maine law since 1949. Maine's current Equal Pay 
statute, 26 MRS section 628, dates back to 1965 and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, 
specifically requiring equal pay for ”comparable work on jobs that have comparable requirements 
relating to skill, effort and responsibility" in the same establishment. The Department receives few 
complaints under this statute and finds even fewer violations. Yet we know that the considerable 
earnings gap between males and females across industries and occupations persists. 
ln reviewing this bill, the Department analyzed available data regarding earnings differentials among 
several categories. We found that the discrepancy between the earnings of male and female workers 
in Maine, while still quite large, is exceeded by the discrepancy between Black or African American 
workers and White or other categories of workers. In particular: , 
0 Among all workers sixteen years and older over the past 12 months, Black workers earned 
slightly over two-thirds of what White workers earned. 
0 More specifically, Black men who worked full-time, year-round in the past 12 months earned 
72% of what White men earned who worked full-time, year-round in the past 12 months; and 
I Black women who worked full-time, year-round in the past 12 months earned only 66% of what 
White women earned who worked full-time, year-round in the past 12 months. 
0 And most dramatically, Black women earned only 54% -slightly over half!— of what White 
men earned. (The attached table contains more detailed information.)

Over the more than ﬁve decades since Maine's Equal Pay law first took effect, the pay gap between A 
men and women has diminished a bit, and a variety of measures have been added to strengthen the 
impact ofthe statute. We believe that these multiple strategies, in totality, have helped to close the 
pay gap between men and women. But there is still work to do. The Department urges workers to 
contact us or use our complaint form to report if they suspect they are being paid less than their 
colleagues for comparable work. And adding pay discrimination based on race to the prohibited 
actions of an employer will give us the additional tools necessary to continue making progress in this 
8l"88.‘ 
The Department urges you to support LD 1703 and will continue to work to make the Maine Equal Pay 
Law effective.
