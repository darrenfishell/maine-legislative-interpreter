L D 1917, “RESOLUTION, Proposmg an Amendment to the Const1tut1on of Mame To Implement 
Ranked-cholce Votmg for Govemor, State Senator and State Representat1ve ” 
Senator Hlckman, Representatlve Sup1ca and Members of the Jolnt Standmg Commlttee on Veterans 
and Legal Affalrs, my name 1s Shenna Bellows and I am the Secretary of State and the chlef electlons 
off1cer I am speakmg today 1n support of L D 1917 
Pnor to my t1me 1n ofﬁce, I was an ongmal member of the Commlttee for Ranked Cho1ce Vot1ng 
(RCV), wh1ch worked to pass Ma1ne’s ranked cho1ce law, try1ng repeatedly through the leg1slat1ve 
process, and eventually succeedlng 1n passlng the law through Ma1ne’s c1t1zen 1mt1at1ve process 1n 
2016 At thls tlme, based on statewlde votes, legal (l6ClSlO1 ‘1S and the prov1s1ons of the Mame 
Const1tut1on, the State of Mame 1s uslng ranked -cho1ce votmg for all of Ma1ne's state-level prnnary 
electlons, and 1n general electrons only for federal offlces, mcludlng the offlce of U S Presldent The 
ranked-cholce rounds are used only m races 1n Wh1ch there are more than two cand1dates Now, th1s 
b1ll seeks to change our const1tut1on to allow for nnplementatlon of ranked cholce votmg for general 
electlons for the Govemor, State Senator, and State Representatlve 
You have all heard from testlmony glven for a dlfferent b1ll how much we support ranked cholce 
votlng because of the ab1l1ty 1t glves to voters to rank the cand1dates on the1r ballots, lnstead of causlng 
stress and worry that votlng for then favonte candldate 1n a plurahty electlon may end up helpmg the1r 
least favonte candldate Wm, that they W111 have to vote for the lesser of two ev1ls, or that then dec1s1on 
Wlll spl1t the vote Voter frustratron, often found m that plurahty votmg, does not always accurately 
reﬂect the Wlll of the majonty, and th1s 1s one of the reasons Mame voters chose RCV Voters should 
feel and know that thelr vote matters, and that the electlons they partlclpate 1n result 1n representatlon 
that mlrrors the electorate 
We support expandmg the use of ranked cholce votmg to general electlons for Governor and state 
legrslatlve offlces 
Th1s concludes my testrmony I am happy to answer quest1ons or pI‘0VlClC addrttonal rnformatlon later
