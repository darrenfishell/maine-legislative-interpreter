RE LD 1917 — RESOLUTION, Proposmg an Amendment to the Constltutnon of Mame To 
Implement Ranked-cho|ce Votmg for Governor, State Senator and State Representatlve 
Good mornmg Senator H|ckman and Representatlve Suplca 
My name IS W|ll Hayward I am here today as the Advocacy Program Coordmator on behalf of the 
League of Women Voters of Mame lam testlfymg In support on LD 1917 
The League of Women Voters of Mame IS a nonpart|san po||t|cal organlzatlon that has been workmg for 
over 100 years to encourage mformed and actlve part|c|pat|on In government, to mcrease understandlng 
of l‘|"|8jOl' pubhc policy ISSUGS, and to mfluence pubhc pollcy through educatlon and advocacy We never 
support or oppose any polltlcal party or candldate 
In smgle-seat electlons, the League of Women Voters of Mame supports electlon systems where the 
wmner |s the person who recelves a majorlty of the votes We belleve that the majonty threshold IS 
healthy for our democrat|c process and provldes a mandate for govermng We support ranked cholce 
votmg as the best way to determme whlch candldate has a majorlty of the vote 
The League supports LD 1917 Th|s b||l would remove the lmpedlment to ranked cholce votmg ldentlﬁed 
by the 2017 Solemn Occaslon op|n|on of the Mame Supreme Court A majorlty of voters have takena 
stand In favor of ranked cholce votmg on two occas|ons, |nclud|ng for these state ofﬁces But |n the 
court's v|ew, the Mame Constltutlon must be amended before the full w|ll of the voters can be reallzed 
LD 1917 amends the constltutlon to fulﬁll the w|ll of voters — expressed |n 2016 and 2018 — by allowmg 
ranked-cholce votmg to be used |n general electlons for the Leglslature and Governor 
We belleve that a majoruty of Mame voters support ranked-cholce votmg and support l’CS expansion to 
state leglslatlve and gubernatorlal races However, even If you do not share our bellef, th|s b|ll merlts 
your conslderatlon As a constltutlonal amendment, should |t recelve the necessary support |n the 
Leglslature, Mame voters would stlll have the ﬁnal word By poslng the questlon of whether to put 
ranked C|’IOlC€ votmg |n our constltutlon, we can feel conﬁdent that Mame voters w|ll dellver the ﬁnal 
verdlct on whether ranked cholce votmg IS here to stay We know a strong majonty of voters ﬁnd 
ranked-cholce votmg easy to use, let's entrust them to declde whether to enshrme |t |n our constltutlon 
We urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1917 
Thank you for the opportumty to testlfy I would be happy to answer any questlons from the Commlttee
