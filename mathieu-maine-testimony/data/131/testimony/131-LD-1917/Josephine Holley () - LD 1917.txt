This bill Ought Not Pass,,,Rank Choice Voting has caused more confusion to voters 
here in Maine.  Working the polls locally, have seen it first hand…One Person One 
Vote….some how Maine has been made SPECIAL,,,in changing how the rest of the 
nation votes.
(Alaska not has joined the ranks of confusion.)
