Testimony in Opposition to LD 1917
RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine To Implement Ranked-choice
Voting for Governor, State Senator and State Representative 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs:
My name is Nathan Gould, and I am submitting this testimony in opposition to LD 1917, 
“RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine To Implement Ranked-choice 
Voting for Governor, State Senator and State Representative.”
I am unequivocally opposed to the expansion of ranked-choice voting. Ranked-choice voting is 
already controversial. We must return to choosing our elected officials by a plurality, a simpler and 
straightforward system. I would like to see an end to the ranked-choice experiment.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass. Thank you for reading this testimony.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
