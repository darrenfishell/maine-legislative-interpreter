LD 1917
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident and voter in Union Maine.   
I am writing in strong support of RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine To Implement Ranked-choice Voting for Governor, State 
Senator and State Representative
The state Constitution was changed to resolve a dispute long ago and that is the 
reason that RCV is not allowed for Governor, State Senator and State Representative. 
I support the resolution which would put Majority voting back for these offices as our 
Constitution originally intended.  
RCV is necessary and I am thankful that we have it now in our state.   No one should 
be elected to any office without the majority of voters supporting them.
Thank you 
Pamela Vose
