LD 1917
I write in opposition to LD 1917. Ranked-choice voting ought to be repealed in the 
state of Maine!
Ranked choice voting is how unpopular candidates get installed.
Legal citizens in the United Stated are entitled to one vote. . . not roll the dice until we
like the result.
I suggest the uniparty in Maine find better candidates who can muster at least 50% of 
the vote.
LD 1917 OUGHT NOT PASS!
