LD 1917
I'm writing in opposition to LD 1917, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of
Maine To Implement Ranked-choice Voting for Governor, State Senator and State 
Representative. 
In my lifetime, there has been no single issue that has upset me as much as ranked 
choice voting. I have no doubt that RCV is unconstitutional and I wish somebody 
would take it to the Supreme Court and settle it once and fore all. I believe if an 
honest and clear question was ever placed on the ballot asking the people of Maine if 
they want to keep RCV or get rid of it, they would vote to get rid of it. This belief is 
supported by the fact that none of my family, friends or coworkers support RCV. In 
fact, I don't know a single person who does.
Democratic choice, within the confines of our constitutional republic, forms the 
bedrock of Americaâ€™s system of governance. Adopting a simple, fair, and secure 
voting system is fundamental to democratic elections. It is clear that plurality 
elections are much simpler and easier to understand than races determined by 
ranked-choice voting.
An analysis of 96 ranked-choice voting elections from across the country showed that 
the voting system produces false majorities, frequently exhausts more than 10 percent 
of ballots cast on Election Day, and further disenfranchises voters who are already 
less likely to vote.
While proponents of ranked-choice voting may claim the new voting system is a 
better alternative to traditional voting systems, the plurality system offers voters an 
easier method of selecting representatives without the false promises of ranked-choice
voting.
I urge this committee to vote "Ought Not To Pass" on LD 1917.
