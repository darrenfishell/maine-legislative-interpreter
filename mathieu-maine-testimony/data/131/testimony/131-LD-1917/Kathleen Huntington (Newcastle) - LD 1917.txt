     I firmly believe our state Constitution would better serve all Mainers if we amend 
it to add ranked choice voting for Governor, state senators and state representatives. 
Ranked Choice Voting encourages more civil campaigning and is a better indication 
of who we Mainers want to represent us, requiring a majority, not a simple plurality, 
to win an election. Thankfully we already use RCV for federal positions; let's come 
full circle and make it our method of electing the one person believed to be 
appropriate by a majority of voters for our state leaders, as well.
