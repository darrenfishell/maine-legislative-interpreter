RE:LD 1917
My name is Tom Keller and I am a resident of Newcastle in Lincoln County and I am 
writing in complete support of LD 1917. When passed this bill will reduce the 
confusion on which elections are held which way, and make all of them based on 
ranked choice. That eliminates one problem.
A second problem this bill eliminates is the undervaluing of multiple candidate 
elections. By allowing ranked choice voting, the voice of the people is actually 
magnified by allowing them to select the candidates of their choice in the order of 
their choice. This is not a difficult undertaking and is easily learned by the many 
resources available through the Secretary of State’s Office and the League of Women 
Voters. And, in fact, we already do this for some elections. 
It makes no sense to have two systems in the state – one for federal elections and one 
for state and local elections. If anything, that causes more confusion than it resolves.
Since the Maine people have already voted by referendum for ranked choice voting, 
this is the opportunity for the Legislature to put that into effect as was our intention in 
2016.
Please vote Ought to Pass on LD 1917.
Thank you.
