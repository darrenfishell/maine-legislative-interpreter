Ranked-Choice
Voting
(RCV)
is
a
fad
and
a
costly
failure,
both
in
practice
and
in
the
abstract.
Political
scientists
have
studied
it
and
found
that
greater
ballot
complexity
drives
“the
negative
effect
of
RCV…[which]
increases
as
elections
become
less
competitive,
and
that
it
increases
with
the
number
of
candidates.”
1
Research
from
San
Francisco
has
also
shown
that
“the
adoption
of
RCV
exacerbated
disparities
in
voter
turnout
between
those
who
are
already
likely
to
vote
and
those
who
are
not,
including
younger
voters
and
those
with
lower
levels
of
education.”
2
Voters
should
understand
that,
under
RCV,
their
votes
may
not
count.
This
is
why
Hazel
Dukes,
president
of
the
New
York
State
chapter
of
the
National
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Colored
People,
called
RCV
“voter
suppression”
in
a
comment
to
The
New
York
Post
in
2021,
adding
that
“Ranked
choice
voting
is
not
beneficial
to
minorities.”

Think
of
it
this
way:
less
than
one
percent
of
mailed
ballots
are
rejected
in
the
average
U.S.
election,
but
a
2019
Maine
Policy
Institute
analysis
of
nearly
100
RCV
races
found
that,
on
average,
“exhausted
ballots”
made
up
more
than
10-times
that
amount.
For
those
not
familiar
with
the
term,
exhausted
ballots
occur
when
a
voter
does
not
rank
one
of
the
two
final-round
candidates,
and
their
ballot
is
removed
from
the
final
tally.
A
report
by
Princeton
professor
Nolan
McCarty
submitted
to
the
U.S.
District
Court
in
Maine
found
that,
in
15
of
98
races
studied,
more
than
20
percent
of
ballots

were
exhausted.
McCarty
also
found
higher
rates
of
exhausted
ballots
among
electorates
with
more
elderly
and
non-college-educated
voters.

In
the
2018
Maine
Gubernatorial
Democratic
primary,
nearly
9,000
voters
(7%)
had
their
ballots
removed
by
the
final
tally.
In
other
words,
these
voters
cast
legible
ballots,
but
were
ultimately
excluded
when
determining
the
“majority
winner.”
How
can
a
system
be
branded
as
more
democratic
when
it
relies
on
removing
ballots
from
the
final
count
to
arrive
at
its
false
majority?
Often
because
of
high
rates
of
exhausted
ballots,
more
than
six-in-ten
RCV
winners
do
not
earn
a
majority
of
votes
cast.
Some
say
this
can
be
solved
through
voter
education,
but
McCarty
saw
higher
rates
of
exhausted
ballots
even
among
electorates
with
more
experience
with
RCV
elections.
Under
RCV,
not
only
must
voters
understand
the
issues
and
candidates
on
their
ballots,
but
they
must
strategically
plot
their
choices
to
maximize
their
effect
on
the
outcome.
By
declining
to
rank
every
candidate
or
choosing
to
vote
for
less-widely
popular
third-party
candidates,
their
votes
are
unwillingly
diluted.
In
this
way,
RCV
has
its
own
“spoiler
effect,”
similar
to
the
way
in
which
today’s
third-party
and
independent
voters
must
succumb
when
asked
to
choose
between
one
of
the
two
major
party
candidates
to
avoid
“throwing
away
a
vote.”
It
is
certainly
no
better
in
this
regard.
One
thing
is
certain:
RCV
is
inherently
more
complex
and
confusing
to
voters
than
the
status
quo,
which
is
reflected
in
the
level
of
exhausted
ballots
and
disaffected
voting
blocs.
Voting
systems
should
meet
some
basic
criteria:
casting
a
ballot
is
as
easy
as
possible,
and
every
voter
can
be
assured
that
his
or
her
vote
will
count
equally
toward
the
final
result.
Unfortunately,
RCV
fails
these
simple
tests.
Please
deem
LD
1917
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
instead
repeal
ranked-choice
voting
entirely
from
Maine
law.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
