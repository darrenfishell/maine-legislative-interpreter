Having just enough time to write brief testimony I will make this brief and 
"interesting." 
For those who think this is confusing RCV.  I am thinking if they had to vote for their 
favorite football game beverage, it wouldn't confuse them at all.  Their choices of 
being served would be: 
Budwiser
Coors 
Near Beer
Coffee
Milk
Soy Milk
My thinking is, they wouldn't have much of a problem with their first and second 
choices...and maybe they'd even take the time to make a third or fourth.  Easy. 
That's what rank choice voting is...voting for your preferences...IN ORDER of BEST 
to LEAST BEST. 
It is about a majority of votes winning the day...not a plurality. And chances are, this 
way, you'll be happier in the long run.  
OR, you can vote for just ONE....say Budwiser and call it good, because you wouldn't
want any of the others if somebody gave it to you. 
MAJORITY VOTE WINS - RANKED CHOICE VOTING 
Easy 
Peasy
Beautiful.
