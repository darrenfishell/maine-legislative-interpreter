I believe that ranked choice voting should be implemented in Maine because it is the 
best way to ensure that the ultimate winner of an election represents the interests and 
welfare of the largest percentage of the electorate.  Ranked choice voting will prevent 
the election of a candidate who wins a plurality in the first round but that does not 
represent the interests of at least 50% of the electorate.
