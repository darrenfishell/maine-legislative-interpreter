LD 1917
Greetings:
As a long time voter in the State of Maine I wish to express my dismay that the 
disaster known as Rank Choice Voting is being promoted. Again. 
RCV is just plain awful.  Any person who has attempted to make sense out of a RCV 
ballot will come to the same conclusion I have come to.  The RCV ballot is difficult 
to navigate and brings questionable results.  This comes after researching the 
candidates, trying to understand their positions and finally having to make multiple 
selections in the order of preference.  
In my opinion there is little to gain by approving this practice for major offices and 
much to lose by confusing and discouraging voters from casting their vote.  Please 
vote NO on this misguided proposal.  Vote NO on LD 1917.  Thank You
Robert Smith
