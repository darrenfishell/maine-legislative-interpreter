Testimony of Represemwtive ﬁlichael Brennan Introducing 
LD 1162, An Act to Protect the Environment by Funding Ash Tree 
Management 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and F oresrrfy 
Good morning, Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker and honorable members of the 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee. My name is Michael Brennan, andI 
represent House district 115, which includes a portion of Portland. I am here to introduce LD 
1162, An Act to Protect the Environment by F undiug Ash Tree Management 
The emerald ash borer is one of the most serious invasive species threatening our ash resources 
and forests. All species of native ash trees that grow in Maine, with the exception of mountain 
ash, are susceptible to injury and death by the emerald ash borer. They tunnel through the 
conductive tissue of trees and cut off the ﬂow of water and nutrients, killing the trees in ﬁve 
years or less- 
\Vhen we lose our ash trees, we lose a crucial food source for wildlife and a key material for 
traditional basket making, which is important in the cultural traditions of the Wabanaki tribes of 
the region. With the loss of this resource, we can expect potential economic impacts of nearly 
S320 million to forest landowners. The removal of dying and dead trees will cost millions of 
dollars and will impact our tree-lined communities. 
This bill simply provides ongoing funding of $500,000 to provide grants to towns and 
municipalities to address ash tree disease issues and expand tree replacement efforts. 
Thank you for considering this legislation. I am happy to help answer any questions you may 
have. 
District 115: Part of Portland
