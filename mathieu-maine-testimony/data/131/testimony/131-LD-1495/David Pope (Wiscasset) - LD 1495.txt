LD 1495
I am David Pope of Wiscasset, Maine, a retired high school science teacher.  In 1966, 
while in college, I prospected in the wilds of Quebec for a company which had 
discovered a copper deposit.  Today, more than 50 years later, I returned by Google 
Earth only to find several stagnant looking ponds on denuded ground.  The 
magnificent river, which ran through the deposit, is now in a ditch, diverted around 
the formerly forested mine site. Countless stories like this have made people wary of 
any attempts to change Maine’s stringent mining laws. 
The LD 1495 Commission would be comprised of a cross section of Maine people. 
Based on their findings, the public and lawmakers would build understanding of 
modern mining methods, and be able to evaluate proposed changes to Maine’s mining
laws. Without such a review and resulting education, proposed changes will face 
justified mistrust of mining, mistrust of government, mistrust of science. In short, this 
Commission would make it possible to make informed decisions about Maine mining 
laws. This Commission is needed if we are to make thoughtful progress with our 
mining laws. I urge you to support it.
