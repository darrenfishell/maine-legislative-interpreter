Testimony for the 131st Session of the Maine Legislature 
Committee on Taxation 
 Public Hearing: May 4, 2023 
 
 LD. 1544:  An Act to Improve Economic Security for Maine Children by 
Establishing the Maine Dependent Tax Credit.   
Chairpersons Senator Grohoski and Representative Perry and Members of 
the Committee, my name is Suzanne Rudalevige and I live in Cape 
Elizabeth. I am a member of the anti-racism policy group at the 
HopeGateWay Church in Portland. 
 I am in support of this bill because its greatest positive impact will be on 
those in our State who have the least. Due to our long time structural 
inequities, the bulk of our Black and Brown residents are invariably at the 
bottom of Maine’s economic ladder. This we must change. My reading of 
the Bible leaves me in no doubt that this is   the way that God would have 
us go. 
This child tax credit is modest but powerful in the difference it can make to 
those living on the margins. Because it does not have a minimum income 
threshold, it will be much more meaningful than Maine’s previous 
Dependent Exemption Tax Credit. We know from the data that this was 
helpful in raising many families into something like livable economic levels, 
as did the now defunct Federal child tax credit.  
 In a year that promises that Maine will have more than expected   State 
income, let us use it to raise our residents’ living standards. (This kind of 
tax credit is so much more efficient at raising the standard of living of the 
poor than tax cuts, since those invariably help the wealthy way more, 
making the wealth gap even wider.)  
The cost of the tax credits will, by and large, go back into Maine’s 
economy, thus encouraging wider stability than simply among the families 
who receive them. It’s time to stop blaming the poor for their economic 
status and face up to why so many boats are grounded by past 
discrimination and arbitrary judgement. This is our opportunity to float all 
boats in Maine!! 
Thank you.
