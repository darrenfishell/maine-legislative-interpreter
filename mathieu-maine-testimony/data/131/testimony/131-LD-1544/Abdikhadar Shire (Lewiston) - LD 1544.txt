Abdikhadar Shire
Lewiston
LD 1544
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Taxation: my name is Abdikhadar Shire, I am a resident of Lewiston, 
and I am writing to testify in favor of LD 1544.
Just over 2 years ago I founded AK Health and Social Services because I saw that 
many people in my community were having trouble accessing the basics of life in the 
United States: Employment. Housing. Healthcare. At AK Health, we offer workforce 
development, case management, and literacy training, and during the pandemic we 
expanded into health equity work. 
I see in my work every day that our communities need support. The expanded federal 
Child Tax Credit helped so many of the families we work with, so they could still get 
by despite the increasing costs of basic needs such as housing, childcare, and food. 
Making the proposed changes to Maine’s child tax credit would raise 3,500 Maine 
kids above the poverty line. Why wouldn’t we make this investment in our future?
As a parent, I don’t want to have to choose between important things. For us, the 
expanded federal CTC helped keep us in our apartment when our rent increased last 
year. And costs have continued to rise. Lots of families are feeling the pinch.
But one thing all Maine families have in common–no matter what language we speak 
at home or what meals we put on the table–-is a desire to protect our children and 
provide a secure future for them. Let’s pass LD 1544 for all our children and our 
common future.
