LD 1544
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Taxation: My name is Sharon Carter, and I’m a parent and a 
grandparent from Lewiston. In the past, my husband and I have also been foster 
parents. I am writing in support of LD 1544.
I urge Maine’s legislature to pass and fund LD 1544 – which will make Maine’s Child
Tax Credit available to everyone, even our families with the lowest incomes, and 
increase it to $350.
 
My husband Chuck and I have adopted two kids. We do what we can to help our kids 
have a normal childhood, even if they had a difficult start in life. 
One of our children was diagnosed with autism last year, and we’re working to make 
sure he has the structure and support he needs to thrive. 
I was also diagnosed with cancer in 2021 and am undergoing treatment. Cancer is 
scary for families, but we’re all staying positive. 
I share all this because I want you to understand that our family is resilient. And I 
want you to understand that the Child Tax Credit makes our families and our 
communities MORE resilient – especially now, with costs rising all the time.
We’re lucky that we can meet our kids’ basic needs. But the expanded federal CTC in
2021 allowed us to go further. We were able to open up a savings account for the 
kids’ education needs, buy a computer for our son, and send our daughter to camp in 
the summer. 
LD 1544 in Maine will make sure that families of all shapes and sizes who need a 
little extra boost can receive it – three hundred fifty dollars a year, no matter how low 
their incomes are. 
That extra cash makes a big difference – and research has shown that programs like 
the expanded CTC help kids their whole lives. They stay in school longer, they’re 
healthier, and they have higher salaries as adults. 
I ask you to please support LD 1544. For Maine’s families. Thank you.
