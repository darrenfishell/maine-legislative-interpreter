My name is Mary-Gene Rumery, I am the adoptive mother of four and the biological mother of one and l am from Norridgewock. l struggle year long to ensure all of my family's basic needs are met. We, like so many others, are making ends meet by borrowing from one bill to pay another. If LD1544 were to be passed it would help my family and so many others to be more financially secure throughout the year. I encourage you to support LD1544 today.
