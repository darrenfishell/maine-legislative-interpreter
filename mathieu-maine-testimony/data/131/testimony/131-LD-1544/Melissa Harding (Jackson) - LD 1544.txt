Senator
Claxton,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services:
My
name
is
Melissa
Harding,
I
am
a
mom
of
four ,
I
live
in
Jackson
and
I
am
writing
today
to
testify
in
favor
of
LD
1544.
I
am
testifying
in
favor
of
this
bill
because
I
truly
wish
the
Child
T ax
Credit
was
still
coming
to
families.
Before
the
CTC
started
my
husband
and
I
had
been
doing
our
best
to
keep
our
heads
above
water ,
however
something
was
always
late
or
behind
no
matter
how
hard
we
tried.
Paying
bills
was
always
like
robbing
Peter
to
pay
Paul.
When
we
started
receiving
the
CTC
it
was
immediate
relief
and
I
realized
how
much
financial
stress
we
actually
had
because
I
felt
it
going
away .
The
first
few
months
were
life
changing.
W e
were
no
longer
robbing
Peter
to
pay
Paul.
W e
did
not
have
to
choose
between
keeping
our
lights
on
or
having
groceries
in
the
fridge.
During
that
12
months
my
car
payment
was
actually
on
time
every
month
for
the
first
time
which
saved
me
another
$50
every
month
in
late
fees.
All
my
children's
needs
were
being
met
and
mine
and
my
husband's
mental
health
seriously
improved
since
we
were
no
longer
trying
to
keep
our
heads
above
water ,
we
actually
had
the
chance
to
swim.
W e
had
relief
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time.
Now
that
the
CTC
has
stopped,
many
of
the
same
stresses
are
just
a
part
of
our
everyday
life
again
and
we
are
faced
with
making
decisions
between
essential
needs
like
paying
electric
on
time
or
having
to
take
the
late
fees
to
avoid
disconnection
and
ultimately
pay
more
for
the
bill
we
couldn't
af ford
in
the
first
place.
Having
to
choose
between
medications,
or
groceries,
keeping
your
lights
on,
or
your
home
warm
are
not
choices
families
should
have
to
make.W e
can
not
continue
to
ignore
that
familiar
ARE
making
these
choices,
and
the
ones
who
suf fer
the
most
are
our
children.
The
cost
of
living
and
surviving
continues
to
rise
and
the
choices
are
getting
harder
and
harder
to
make.
I
sincerely
urge
everyone
on
this
committee
to
think
of
a
child
and
ask
yourself
if
they
deserve
to
thrive.
The
answer
is
yes.
Every
single
one
of
them
deserves
a
chance
to
thrive.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
and
I
hope
to
see
you
all
in
favor
of
LD
1544.
