Meeting urgent needs ● Empowering people ● Advocating for change ● Creating solutions to 
homelessness and hunger
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Taxation 
Committee,
My name is Devon Stockmayer, and I am the Advocacy Supervisor at Preble Street 
working with the Maine Hunger Initiative. I am writing to express my enthusiastic 
support for and urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD1544: An Act to Improve 
Economic Security for Maine Children by Establishing the Maine Dependent Tax 
Credit. 
In partnership with DoorDash, the Preble Street Food Security Hub (FSH) delivers 
food boxes to households across Southern Maine. Since the end of SNAP 
emergency allotments, we have seen a significant spike in the number of food box 
orders the FSH receives—as many as 200 more per month. We need to identify 
long-term policy solutions to relieve families of the stress of hunger and allow 
them the dignity of traveling to the grocery store or the farmer’s market to select 
food for their household. LD1544 provides a long-term tax solution to end food 
insecurity for families across Maine. 
LD1544 will expand the dependent exemption tax credit for Maine families 
experiencing poverty. It is an opportunity to put money back in the pockets of 
households struggling to stay afloat, a credit that can be used to directly support 
children and offset household expenses in a time of high inflation. Busy parents 
and families should not worry about whether they can put meals on the table, and 
all Mainers deserve food security and freedom.
When you set food insecurity data in Maine against the dramatic impact of these 
tax credit payments, the numbers speak for themselves. Of the more than 571,000 
households in Maine, 9.5% face hunger. Maine has long held the highest rates of 
childhood food insecurity in New England, with one in six children experiencing it. 
Yet federal monthly child tax credit payments during the pandemic lifted more than 
10,000 children and their families out of poverty. While the expanded CTC during 
COVID reduced food insufficiency by 19% for families across the state, food 
insufficiency has increased by 25% since the end of the federal benefit.

LD1544 is a chance to change this, to lend families a hand by giving them a tax 
credit for their children. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates 
that this tax credit could reduce child poverty in Maine by up to 12.3% — 
transforming the lives of 3,500 children. With a broad standard for qualifying, the 
credit proposed by LD1544 will reach low to middle-income families who often 
slip through the cracks in accessing these kinds of tax benefits but desperately need 
the help. 
Healthy humans need nourishment, shelter, and stability — all severely threatened 
when households cannot make ends meet. An investment in Maine children is an 
investment in the future of Maine. I urge you to vote in support of LD1544. Thank 
you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Devon Stockmayer
