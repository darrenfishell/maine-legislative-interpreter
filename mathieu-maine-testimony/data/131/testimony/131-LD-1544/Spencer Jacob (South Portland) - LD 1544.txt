CTC Testimony 
 
Hello Everyone, thank you for your time today 
My name is Spencer, I live in South Portland with my wife and two-year-old daughter, Claudia 
 
I am writing to express my strong support for the child tax credit. As a parent, I understand the 
financial burden of raising a child. However, I strongly believe that every cent put into our children is 
the right path to a stronger, smarter, and kinder society. The child tax credit provides much-needed 
relief for families such as mine struggling to cover the costs of child care, education, and other essential 
expenses. 
 
The child tax credit not only helps families make ends meet, but also invests in the future of our 
economy by supporting the education and well-being of our children. It is essential to ensure that every 
child has the opportunity to reach their full potential regardless of their family’s income. 
 
The child tax credit has been a lifeline for many families, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This refundable tax credit has been expanded to benefit more families, providing monthly payments to 
help cover the costs of raising a child. This critical support has protected families from financial 
hardship and contributed to the overall economic recovery. 
 
I urge you to continue supporting the child tax credit and expand its benefits to ensure that every child 
has the chance to succeed. Investing in our children and families is a fundamental obligation that we all 
share, and the child tax credit is one way that we can fulfill that commitment.  
 
Let’s set the next generation up for success. They’ll be taking care of us in the end.
