Honorable members of the Taxation Committee: 
I strongly support L1544, an Act to Improve Economic Security for Maine Children 
by Establishing the Maine Dependent Tax Credit designed to reduce child poverty in 
Maine. 
With the expiration of the enhanced Federal Child Credit which reduced Maine child  
poverty by almost half, many families are re-experiencing the stresses of poverty. It 
has been estimated by economists that the Federal Child tax credit would have a 
1000% return on investment per year ($10 for each $1 spent.
My husband, Joe Wishcamper, and I have been involved directly in a Direct Basic 
Income pilot, the Magnolia Motherâ€™s Trust, a program of Springboard to 
Opportunities in Jackson, Mississippi. The results of  four cohorts of families have 
been amazing beyond expectation. We are currently working with Quality Housing 
Coalition, Victoria Morales, on Project Home Trust, to begin a similar initiative in 
Southern Maine. 
Social and educational programs are important to family well being but there needs to
be a foundation of adequate available cash for families to rise above the debilitating 
stress of not having money to meet the most basic of needs. 
We have seen the impact.  
We hope the Taxation Committee will take this opportunity to structurally provide the
conditions for all Maine children to have access to a safe, healthy childhood leading 
to successful experiences. throughout their lives. 
Thank you for your careful attention to this critical matter that has the potential to 
change many many lives.
