LD 1544
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Taxation: my name is Ashley Medina, I am a resident of Lewiston, and
I am writing in support of LD 1544.
I’m a single mom to two kids. I work to support leadership development in young 
people, and I serve on the Lewiston school committee. I can tell you that the 
expanded federal child tax credit in 2021 was a life-saver for so many people in my 
community. 
We all know basic necessities have been getting more expensive. Those CTC 
payments helped me buy groceries, pay my oil bill, and buy things the kids needed. I 
knew a new mother who was living on half her normal paycheck while on maternity 
leave. The expanded CTC helped her buy diapers, pay her rent, and give her child a 
better start in life. For other people, it meant better access to food and transportation. 
It was a big relief to know they had that money to back them up.
The full refundability of this credit means it will help the families who need it most. 
Even a bit of extra cash can make a big difference to kids as they’re growing up. It 
means peace of mind, and less anxiety in the home. Sometimes kids feel they have to 
go out and make money to help support their families. I’ve known of kids who steal 
basic necessities their families can’t afford. People have to survive. Why not give kids
a bit more access to the life we say we want them to lead?
I hope you will advance LD 1544 and make this investment in Maine’s future. Thank 
you.
