Senator Nicole Grohoski, Representative Joe Perry and members of the Taxation Committee, 
My name is Rajel Hippler and l am a mom of 2 in Oakland. I am testifying in favor of LD1544, a 
bill that would really help low income families to create a more solid future for their families. 
Have you EVER lived in poverty? Have you ever tried to stretch a few dollars in a day? I know 
many of the people in my support system live below poverty level. How awful is that? How can 
we continue to allow this to happen - kids growing up in poverty? According to the Kids Count 
Data Center, in 2021 13.8% of families lived below poverty level. To me, that right there is 
ridiculous. What can you do with this bill to make our children's lives better? Vote yes on 
LD1544. Support the Child Tax Credit. Support a stronger future.
