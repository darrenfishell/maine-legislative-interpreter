LD 1544

To members of the Committee on Taxation of the Maine legislature:
I am writing in support of LD 1544, “An Act to Improve Economic Security for 
Maine Children by Establishing the Maine Dependent Tax Credit.”
The federal Child Tax Credit implemented in 2021 demonstrated that a small amount 
of money ($250-300/month) can make a large difference in how children fare in our 
economy. It is a terrible shame that the payment did not continue into the present. The
percentage of children experiencing poverty dropped dramatically in 2021 as a result 
of the credit. Even those who still were considered in poverty were better able to 
survive, if not thrive, as a result of that program.
While the smaller amount from this tax credit will not be as beneficial, it is a start. We
must recognize that individuals who do not receive enough money to meet their basic 
needs work hard, sometimes for inadequate pay and sometimes, such as caregivers for
children, without any pay, and deserve to have enough income to meet their needs. 
This bill recognizes that need and attempts to meet it to a minimal extent.
I know all of us in Maine want healthy children, healthy parents, and healthy 
communities. This bill is a small step toward achieving those goals. Please vote in 
support of LD 1544.
Sincerely,
Larry Dansinger
