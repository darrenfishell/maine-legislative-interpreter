Auburn
LD 1544
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Taxation 
Committee: my name is Meghan Marcous, I live in Auburn, and I am here today to 
testify in favor of LD 1544.
I’m a single mom with two kids – Josiah, who’s 4, and Samarah, who’s 2. 
We all know raising children is incredibly expensive, especially with costs rising the 
way they are right now. I work at a retail store, and I’m working toward a degree right
now at Central Maine Community College. 
I work hard – at work, at school, and raising my children. And sometimes, it’s like the
stress of figuring out how to pay the rent and our bills every month is like another job.
I want Josiah and Samarah have a future where they don’t have to think that way – 
that’s a big part of why I’m getting my degree. But right now, things are tight. 
That’s why I’m here testifying in favor of LD 1544. During the pandemic, the 
expanded Child Tax Credit made such a difference for me and my kids. And we know
that programs like the CTC help kids their whole lives – to stay in school, to be 
healthier, and to have jobs with better salaries when they grow up. 
Here in Maine, we have a chance to build on the success of the expanded CTC, by 
increasing our annual state credit from $300 to $350. This bill will also make the state
CTC fully refundable, to help families with the lowest incomes to pay the bills, or 
maybe even afford something more than the absolute minimum.
Increasing the Maine CTC to $350 and making it fully refundable will help all Maine 
families – including those who need that help the most. I hope you will support this 
bill. Thank you for your time.
