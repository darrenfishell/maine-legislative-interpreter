Testimony in Support of 
LD 1544, “An Act to Improve Economic Security for Maine Children by 
Establishing the Maine Dependent Tax Credit” 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation. My name is Justin Alfond, I am a resident of Portland, and I am 
pleased to submit testimony in support of LD 1544, “An Act to Improve Economic 
Security for Maine Children by Establishing the Maine Dependent Tax Credit.” 
We all know that investing in our kids is crucial. Everyone wants our kids to have every 
opportunity to thrive, grow and reach their full potential. 
One of the most effective ways to invest in our kid’s future is providing support to 
households. When a family has more financial security, it brings stability, reduces 
anxiety, and helps families thrive. 
So often, elected officials present policies without having the benefit of knowing how 
effective that program might be. Thankfully in this case, we aren’t walking in the dark. 
The federal childcare tax credit was introduced in 2021 and it reduced the child poverty 
rate in Maine by nearly half. 
The timing of LD 1544 is crucial because the federal child care tax credit was not 
renewed by Congress. Without LD 1544, Maine’s poverty rate will slide backwards ata 
time when families are already facing too many obstacles and can’t afford it. 
The State of Maine is having our moment. Let’s pass LD 1544 and work together to 
make Maine the best state in the country to raise a family. l urge The Taxation 
Committee to pass LD 1544. Let’s pass LD 1554 and help our kids and families.
