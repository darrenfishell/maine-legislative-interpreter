Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and Members of the Taxation Committee, 
Hi, my name is Michele Gonya ( single Mother to three Special needs sons ages 2O,17&8). I 
live in Winslow. 
I am here today to advocate for LD1544 Child Tax Credit. As a mom l have witnessed first hand 
how this credit has helped my family. We were able to not have the stress of worrying about how items such as new clothes, food, or other bills will be paid for. This credit gave my family a boost 
of support when we needed it the most. I was even able to put five hundred of it in a savings 
account to use for future emergencies. I have also had a huge honor of helping others apply for 
this Child tax credit and make sure others too can have this benefit of, who may not have even 
known this credit even existed to help them in the first place. So please pass LD1544 Child tax 
credit to help all Maine kids and their families to keep moving upward and out of Poverty for 
good. 
Thank you, 
Michele Gonya
