207-324-5762  Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 1544 An Act to 
Improve Economic Security for Maine Children by Establishing the 
Maine Dependent Tax Credit  
 
May 4 , 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry , members of the Committee on 
Taxation, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the Maine Community 
Action Partnership , the membership organization of the ten Community 
Action agencies in Maine,  and we support LD 1544 An Act to Improve 
Economic Security for Maine Children by Establishing the Maine Dependent 
Tax Credit . 
 
Our state’s greatest resource  is our people, and our state’s policies shape 
people’s possibilities.  In Community Action, we create conditions that invite 
children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into the potential in our communities. Through our W hole Family approach , we build a family’s 
capacity for sustained stability and economic growth.  We invest in the 
family’s well- being, we let them drive their own story, and we have tangible 
success.  
 
As these families fulfill their promise and make more money , which  they do, 
many of the necessary supports that have been there to help them to be 
safely housed, fed well and healthy fall out.  You all know about the so -called  
Cliff Effect. It can be devastating to be working hard, enjoying your job and 
your children just to have to say “N o” to a better job for fear of losing those 
supports.  But losing that support is exactly what happened this year, as the 
pandemi c child tax credit, which li fted 50% of families  living in po verty  out of 
poverty, w as cut back.  
 
Imagine, for a mom ent, what that must feel like. Today, you are able to buy 
the groc eries you nee d to feed you family; tomorrow, your SNAP  is cut, your 
monthly child tax credit check doesn ’t come –  you and your family are left 
not just back w here you were, but back to knowing how much you are 
missing. Poverty is not a personal failing, it is a failing of policy, and we are 
failing our m ost vulnerable families.  
 In the work that my member agencies and I do every day, we talk about the 
need to move upstream, to solve problems before they manifest themselves. 
The child tax credit is a proven, effective and cost-effective  way to move 
upstream , to solve problems before they happen. It seems  like a small 
amount of money, $50 more, bu t for the families we are talking about, that 
$50 is a huge amount. It will lift those families closer to a liv ing, breathing, 
fulfilling life. Children that grow  up in poverty are more likely to live in poverty 
their whole lives ; giving those children this chance to live just a  mite above 
poverty, for their  families to afford healthy food, rent, clothes  – to reduce the 
real and persistent  stress th at poverty causes  – that alone is wor th the small 
price  tag. Stress of poverty is violen ce for children. A fully refundable child 
tax credit is a measure of our values and Mainers, as caring  people. 
 
Please support LD 1544 and help our children and their families out of 
poverty.
