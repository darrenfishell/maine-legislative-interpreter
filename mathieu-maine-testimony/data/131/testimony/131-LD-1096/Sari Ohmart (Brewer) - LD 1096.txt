Chairpersons Tipping, Roeder, and members of the Committee of Labor and 
Housing, thank you for allowing this bill to be discussed today. 
My name is Sari Ohmart. I am a resident of Brewer, Maine taught in the State of 
Maine for 39 years. 
I would like to thank all of the legislators for presenting LD 1096 to the legislature. 
I began my teaching career in New Hampshire. After a few years, I came to teach 
in Maine where I received a signiﬁcant decrease in pay. In late 2019 I ofﬁcially 
retired ﬁom teaching. It has been disheartening to say the least to discover how 
much I am being penalized for having been a public school teacher in the State of 
Maine. Upon retirement, I knew that I would not be eligible for any of my 
husband’s Social Security, or mine which I contributed to due to Maine being one 
of the states that has the offset. However, when I discovered that my COLA was 
only on a portion of my pension and that it wasn’t even close to the percent that the 
Federal Government was giving Social Security I truly felt regret for choosing to 
teach in the State of Maine. Since my retirement, just a few years ago, the prices of 
things have sky-rocketed. Groceries, ﬁiel, and electricity especially have had major 
increases. Every month when paying bills I feel like I am losing ground. It is sad 
that I hope I don’t outlive my husband as I would then have to rely on my pension 
alone which appears to be going backwards not forwards. I do not know how 
households that rely solely on State of Maine pensions can survive. 
LD 1096 is a good start to helping retired teachers like myself. Thank you for 
considering this step forward. 
Sincerely, 
Sari Ohmart
