John Kosinski, Government Relations Director, Maine Education Association  
Before the Labor and Housing Committee  
March 28 , 2023  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and esteemed members of the Labor and Housing Committee,  
My name is John Kosinski (he/him) and I am proud to serve as the Director of Government Relations for 
the Maine Education Association (MEA).  The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, 
including teachers and other professionals in nearly ev ery public school in the state and faculty and other 
professional staff in the University of Maine and Community College Systems.  
 
I am here to testify on behalf of the MEA in support of LD 1096, An Act to Help Retired Teachers and 
State Employees Keep Pace with Inflation by Matching the Cost -of-living Adjustment for Social Security 
Benefits.    
 
You have already heard this session abou t many ways retired teachers and ed techs are disadvantaged in 
retirement.  Today, I will not go on and on about the unjust and unfair Social Security offsets, the 
Government Pension Offset (GPO) and Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), that penalize educ ators 
who have earned Social Security benefits, only to lose 2/3rds or more of their benefits because of their 
public pension.  I will not drone on about the dreaded pension cuts in 2011 that froze COLAs, capped 
the COLA to the first $20,000 of earnings (l ater adjusted for inflation), among other reductions in 
benefits.  Instead, this bill is an attempt to specifically address the impact of inflation on retirees , 
especially higher than average inflation as we have seen over the past two years .   
 
Regarding S ection one of the bill, we do not have a position.  Whether we use CPI -U or CPI -W to 
calculate the cost -of-living we feel is irrelevant.  I have reviewed most recent reports of CPI -U and CPI -
W and I don’t believe this change will produce a significant diff erence in benefits for retirees, but we do 
appreciate the concept of aligning our public pension system with the Social Security system.  However, 
the evidence is clear – regardless of whatever metric we use, it is undeniable that pension benefits for 
retired teachers, ed techs and state employees have not kept pace with inflation.   
 
For 21 -22, retirees saw a 4% COLA increase thanks to the bipartisan work of the last Legislature (Thank 
you!).  Inflation during this time was 5.4% (CPI -U).  It is important to  note, the bipartisan supplemental 
budget in 2022 also lifted the base amount the COLA applies to by the full 5.4% inflationary amount.  
This is hugely impactful now and into the future.  This move helped prevent the further degrading in

purchasing power o f benefits for everyone going forward, including teachers and ed techs currently in 
our schools.   
 
For 22 -23, retirees saw a 3% COLA increase, but inflation was 9.1% (CPI -U).  Unlike the budget passed 
last year, the base remained with only the 3% increase,  representing a loss for everyone currently at the 
cap or above, and for all impacted employees currently working in our schools whenever they retire.   
LD 1096 is an attempt to ensure retired teachers, ed techs and state employees can keep pace with 
inflation, rather than the fixed maximum COLA of 3%.  We fully expect the cost of this bill will place 
this solution far out of reach at this time , but we hope that at least some progress could be made towards 
this goal.  We appreciate the intent and hope the Co mmittee will continue to look at solutions for 
retirees.   
 
Thank you for your time and your service to the people of Maine and I will do my best to answer any 
questions you may have.
