I would like to encourage legislators to support this bill for retired educators.  We 
were denied access to social security and depend on our retirement earnings to 
manage our finances as we age.  The current law has allowed our available income vis
a vie cost of living to decline yearly as social security beneficiaries have been better 
equipped to deal with current cost of basic needs.  Please consider the proposed 
legislation as one step in the direction of helping retirees keep up.  The clause of cola 
applying only to part of our retirement salaries is also unfair and prohibitive to all of 
us depending on state retirement.
