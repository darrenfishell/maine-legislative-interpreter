Hello, my name is Michaela Flint. I am a Maine artist and illustrator and I am writing in support
of The Act To Create Public Art Fund.A little background about myself. I am a Maine College 
of Art and Design alumni and I've lived in Portland Maine for eight years. As an artist I 
understand the importance of public art. Public art benefits local artists and the 
public,especially children.Public art adds enormous value to the cultural, aesthetic and 
economic vitality of a community. Allowing more public art in the city of Portland will 
contribute to the community's identity, foster community pride and a sense of belonging, and 
enhance the quality of life for its residents and visitors. Passing this bill will provide 
professional opportunities for artists and cultivate an environment in which the creative class 
thrives.It will boost the local economy for businesses that supply materials and labor; 
restaurants, hotels and transportation companies benefit from a site that attracts visitors. 
Lastly public art will raise public awareness about important community issues, such as 
environmental stewardship and respect for diversity. Passing this bill will be an enormous 
benefit to the city of Portland. I am looking forward to hearing the final decision.
