Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the‘ Education . 
and Culture Affairs Committee, 
I am writing in support of HP 438, An Act to Create the Public Art Fund. Visual-Art and 
Performance Art including dance, music, and theater, need support now more than ever as 
school and municipal budgets whittle away alts funding. Beyond providing beauty, historical 
remembrance, provoking thought and discourse, or challenging one‘s perceptions and 
preconceived notions, art is what makes a civilized society civilized. It creates connection_ 
between people and can help reconnect people to themselves. 
So many Mainers, especially young people and the elderly, are experiencing feelings of 
oven/vhelm, isolation, and depression. The arts can be a 100% pharmaceutical-free way to 
help alleviate some of these issues for people. Put simply, art brings joy. Please pass this 
Act so that all Mainers may experience a bit more joy in these challenging times.
