As a practitioner of music for the last 66 years and a teacher of music for_the last 48 years,I 
fully support the proposal of a Fund for Public Art. Public art is accessible to all and free for 
all, builds a sense of identity within a community, enhances public spaces, encourages‘ 
broader thinking and promotes tourism in areas in which it is displayed. Students who have 
access to the arts early on in their education develop finer motor skills, greater confidence, 
better ability to cooperate with others and exhibit a healthy form of self-expression which 
can enhance the entirety of their lives;‘
