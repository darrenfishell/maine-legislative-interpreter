Dear Committee Members:
I write in strong opposition to this bill. My reasons are as follows: in addition to 
wasting school resources  and opening schools up to lawsuits, it will not make schools
safer as security guards are not law enforcement officers.  It will also further indicate 
that schools are dangerous places for everyone. As a psychotherapist of more than 40 
years of experience I can tell you that our community has yet to fully recover from the
impact of Covid and the last thing school personnel need is more reasons to feel 
anxious. What they need is more protection from guns, to wit, further gun safety 
measures in general.  This bill makes no progress in that area. Thank you
 progress in that area.
