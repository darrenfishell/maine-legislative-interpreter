Anna Mead
Portland
LD 518
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, my name is Anna Mead and I am a 
resident of Portland.  I have a two and a half year old daughter who will start 
kindergarten in a few years, and I am also a nurse practitioner with a background in 
public health.  
 
I oppose LD 52, LD 518, LD 1326 and LD 1557 because I want school to be a place 
where children like my daughter can focus on learning, not a place where they think 
adults must carry weapons in order to keep them safe.  My background in public 
health also informs my opposition to these bills.  In public health we often talk about 
different levels of prevention: primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.  Primary 
prevention aims to prevent disease or injury before it occurs; secondary prevention 
aims to reduce the impact of a disease or injury that has already occurred; and tertiary 
prevention aims to reduce the impact of an ongoing illness or injury that has 
long-lasting affects.  Arming school personnel is a tertiary prevention measure; it does
nothing to prevent gun violence from occurring, only mitigates potential damage from
a mass shooter. 
Rather than waiting until mass shootings occur and implementing tertiary prevention 
methods to mitigate damage, we should focus on primary and secondary prevention 
strategies to keep our children and schools safe.  These strategies could include 
investing in school-based mental health professionals and resources, passing 
legislation that encourages secure storage of firearms, and banning assault-style 
weapons which are so often the weapons of choice for mass shooters. 
Thank you.
