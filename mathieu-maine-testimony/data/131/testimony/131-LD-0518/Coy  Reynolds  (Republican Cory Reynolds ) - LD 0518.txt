Republican Cory Reynolds 
LD 518
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, My Name is Cory Reynolds and I am in 
support for LD- 518 - An Act to Allow Armed Security in Schools. School shootings 
are getting worse in America, children are dying and it’s sad. We Need Armed 
Security Officers, School Resource Officers, and other police officers, and Veterans 
in our schools to keep the students, teachers safe. Please let’s stop playing politics 
Democrat’s and Republican’s and  pass LD-518. 
Thank You, 
Republican Cory Reynolds
