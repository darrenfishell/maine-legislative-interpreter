Hillary Shende
Brunswick
LD 518
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennen, and esteeemed members of the Education 
and Cultural Affairs Commitee, My name is Hillary Shende, and I am here to testify 
against LD 518.
An armed guard in Maine doesn’t have nearly enough training to safely stop a mass 
shooter. Only a fully trained law enforcement officer can do that. So if a municipality 
wants to protect its schools with the presence of a law enforcement officer, but the 
town can’t afford to place a full time officer there, an armed guard would only add to 
the chaos of the moment, should a mass shooter attack. Instead, I would advise 
amending this bill such that a fully qualified law enforcement officer is provided to 
the school at state expense.
Thank you.
