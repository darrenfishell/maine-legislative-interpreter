Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee. 
Let us for a second take ourselves out of this room, out of these proceedings, away from the 
politics and think of this issue as a parent. Or grandparent. Uncle, Aunt, Neighbor. Someone 
who appreciates and recognizes the beauty, innocence, and potential in all children. Our love 
for our children is so profound it's hard to even be rational. And yet, this whole proposed 
legislation is not loving or rational. Why else would the NRA flood inboxes? it has nothing to do 
with the child and everything to do with an agenda. 
Do we truly believe the answer to gun violence is more guns? Arming a young teacher, who 
choose a career in education not police enforcement, with a gun. 
We do not inject a body ﬁghting cancer with cancer. 
We do not use a flamethrower to fight a forest fire 
I believe, in your heart of hearts, you know more guns in schools will not save children but turn 
a playground and classroom into a perilous probability of accidental and unforeseen casualties. 
We are suffering from a headache of gun violence and this bill is asking to turn the music 
louder. 
Vote NO. Republicans have no issue banning abortion to save an unborn child. Then by this 
logic, we should be banning guns in schools to save the ones who are living. 
Think as a parent. Not a politician.
