Grace Leavitt - President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Education and Cultural Affairs 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Committee on Education and Cultural 
Affairs, 
My name is Grace Leavitt. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I proudly serve as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51. I have over 43 years of 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certiﬁed teacher. The MEA represents 
nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well as in our 
institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine Community 
College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as well as many retired educators. 
I am here to testify on behalf of MEA in the strongest of opposition to LD 52 An Act to Allow Certain 
School Employees to Cany Firearms on School Property, LD 518 An Act to Allow Armed Security in 
Schools, LD 1326 An Act to Increase School Security Through Design and Protocol, and LD 1557 An 
Act to Increase and Enhance School Safety by Allowing Individuals with Concealed Carry Permits to 
Possess Handguns on School Property. 
The basis for opposition to these bills is quite simple: The answer to too many guns is NOT more guns! 
The headlines are horriﬁc: 
"74 people have been killed or injured by guns at American schools this year "I 
"More than 349,000 students have experienced gun violence at school since Columbine; There 
have been 3 77 school shootings since I999 “2 
“Frequent shootings put US mass killings on a record pace "3

They are horriﬁc and frequent. And we must do more, much more, to diminish these numbers, these 
incidents, if not avoid them entirely. We all must, and can, do more to keep our students and educators- 
and our communities —-safe. 
But having guns in schools is simply not the answer. Arming school employees, as called for in LD 52, 
would very likely lead to headlines like this one: “In confusion and chaos following a pulled alarm, 
student is shot in error by armed educator ” or “Student manages to obtain educator ’s gun and kills two 
classmates These are imaginary headlines ——ones I hope to never be reading. But with all that 
educators are called upon to do throughout the day, not the least of which is teaching, scenarios like 
these could become real. 
LD 518 would convert our schools from welcoming places to high security institutions. Many districts 
have school resource ofﬁcers, but these ofﬁcers, although in the views of some they do provide a sense 
of security, when they are appropriately trained they are meant to serve as additional supports for 
students, not ‘armed guards’ . And there are many who are opposed to having even SROs in schools at 
all. There are studies that show the trauma this can cause some students and even staff D0 we want our 
schools to have environments that welcome all students, or do We want schools where fear is instilled in 
all who approach the entrance each day? 
LD 1557 will have everyone wondering, “Does that person have a concealed weapon?” Would we all be 
looking at one another with fear and/or suspicion, rather than having a sense of camaraderie and 
collaboration? And then there is the potential for an accident or the wrong person——a student—managing 
to get the individual ’s weapon. 
LD 1326 is perhaps the most heinous of all. Now it is the fault of the educator who perhaps left a door 
unlocked, whether knowingly to allow students to enter or unwittingly in the course of the busy day, ifa 
tragedy should occur. As if such an incident would not already destroy the educator with the sense that 
they may have in any way contributed to a tragic incident, now they would be criminally and civilly 
liable as well. This would not apply to a student who opens a door, even props it open for their friends 
who have arrived late, despite rules dictating otherwise —just the educator who perhaps left a door aj ar 
while on recess duty or the like. 
If you want to increase the already critical shortages of educators, enact any of these proposed bills. You 
will see many more leaving the profession, and even fewer considering entering it. The worry ofa 
possible tragedy, the concern for safety-——these are already enough cause for some to leave and for some 
to turn to other careers. 
The editorial in this past Sunday’s paper, “Our View: A school with guns in it is not a safe school ”4 , had 
149 comments posted by that afternoon- —and they were overwhelmingly, nearly every one, in line with 
the opinion expressed in the editorial.

MEA Resolutions, the positions of the MEA as adopted at our armual Representative Assembly, call for 
schools to have a ‘weapon free environment ’ and that “At no time should parents, students, educators, or 
others be encouraged, permitted or required to carry ﬁrearms on school property ”. 
MEA urges you all to oppose the bills before you today: LD 52, LD 518, LD 1326, and LD 1557 and 
instead encourages you to support LD 22, LD 60, LD 168, and LD 582 which came before the 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety earlier this month as these bills would put in place 
measures that promote better gun safety in our state, and may, just may prevent the kinds of headlines 
we see all too often.
