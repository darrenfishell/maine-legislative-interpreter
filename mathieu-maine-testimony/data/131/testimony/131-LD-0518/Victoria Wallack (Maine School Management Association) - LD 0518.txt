L.D. 518 —AN ACT TO ALLOW ARMED SECURITY IN SCHOOLS

Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Victoria Wallack , director of communications and government relations for Maine Sch ool Management 
Associa tion, testifying on behalf of the legislati ve committe es of the Maine School Boards Association and 
Maine School Superintendent s Association in opposition to L.D. 52, L.D. 518, and L.D.  1557.  
 
These three bills do similar things  with v arying requirements and restrictions . We are opposed t o all three 
because we do not want guns on school property.  
 
L.D. 52 allows school employees to possess or discharge a gun within 500 feet of school property to enhance 
the safety and security of the sc hool, if they’ve done training at the Criminal Justice Ac ademy and have been 
authorized by the School Board to possess or discharge a firearm.  
 
L.D. 518 allows a School Board to engage by contract a school resource office r, private contractor or 
volunteer with applicable background and experience, which are not de fined, to carry.  
 
L.D. 1557  allows a person with a permit to carry concealed handguns, to posses s a firearm on school grounds.  
 
We would like things to be as clear and straightforward as possible w hen it come s to guns on school grounds  
by keeping current st atute as it is. It reads.  
 
Title 20 -A §6552  
Prohibition.   A person may not possess a firearm on public school property or the property of an approved private 
school or discharge a firearm within 5 00 feet of public school property or the property of an appro ved private school.  
 
Exemptions are made for those using a school -operated gun range if the range and gun program are authorized 
by School Board policy.  
 
We urge you to defeat these bills becaus e when the lines get blurred on whether guns are or are not al lowed 
on school property, that has the potential of putting our students and staff at risk.
