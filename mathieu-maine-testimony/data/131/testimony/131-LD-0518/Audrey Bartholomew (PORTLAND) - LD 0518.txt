I am writing to OPPOSE this bill.  I am a former teacher and currently prepare future 
teachers.  The last thing we need is more guns in schools, even carried by trained 
professionals.  We have seen examples of school resource officers and police both 
who are highly trained yet could not safely resolve a school shooting situation in a 
timely manner.  Increasing the number of guns in schools will only lead to fear and 
accidents.
