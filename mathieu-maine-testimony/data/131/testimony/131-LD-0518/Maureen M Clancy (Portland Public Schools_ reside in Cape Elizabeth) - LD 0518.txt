Thank you to the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee for reading my 
testimony. I am a mother, wife, active community member, voter, and school 
employee. My husband and sons hunt and our family does own guns. I understand the
urge to do something to protect our children and school staff from mass shootings and
other forms of violence at school. However, I resist the urge to fight violence with 
more guns. More access to weapons is not the answer to this complex issue. More 
guns in school increases the everyday risk. Law enforcement in schools has not been 
shown to reduce school shootings but has been shown to increase the number of 
students being arrested or criminalized. There are always warnings signs prior to 
violent events like school shootings. It is vital that our schools learn how to support 
students and identify risks. Most students facing crisis will not commit a violent act 
and must not be treated like criminals. School must be trusted places where students 
feel safe to share when they are in crisis and have trained staff to assist them. They 
must know there is support not punishment. We must have safe buildings but more 
important than law enforcement in schools is trained school staff who can assess and 
treat risk. We must create a culture of support not a culture of fear. Law enforcement 
in schools increases disciplinary actions and arrests, and reduces education outcomes 
by increasing chronic absenteeism and dropouts. Children are not criminals, children 
are struggling and suffering and it is the school’s role to provide a safe and nurturing 
environment to learn. Let’s focus on how to improve our schools, meet the needs of 
students and families in our communities, and reduce access to guns as the proven and
most effective ways to increase safety and educate our next generation for a brighter 
future.
