Testimony in Opposition to L.D. 518 
An Act to Allow Armed Security in Schools 
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee: 
 
My name is Sandy Lovell, I live in Portland, and I have two grandchildren who attend 
Longfellow Elementary School in Portland. I also volunteer in a Rowe School elementary 
school classroom once or twice a week.  
 
I want to be one more rational voice asking you to oppose L.D. 518. 
 
Arming untrained and undertrained security guards in a school setting invites mishaps, 
mistakes and potential disasters. Schools would be liable for any injuries. It’s a bad idea.  
 
If we continue to tell the story that our schools are not safe by having guns on site, the 
learning environment changes. Not only the teachers, administrators and staff will know it, 
but the children will know it/feel it as well. If this is not the world we want for our children 
and grandchildren, then let’s not create it.  
 
Let’s support schools to put their full attention on creating a vibrant learning environment 
without distractions or fear. Let’s keep guns out of schools. Period. 
 
Please vote out not to pass L.D. 518.
