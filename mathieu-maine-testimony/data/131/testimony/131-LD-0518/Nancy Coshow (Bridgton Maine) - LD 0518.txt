Honorable Senator Rafferty, Honorable Representative Brenner and all 
members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee 
€3/ ’.3/ 
I have read thru LD. , LD 518 and LD 1326 and consider this 
commonsense legislation for the protection of Maine's schools, which, 
more importantly, helps to protect Maine's children - our future. 
Criminals and those bent on destruction look for "gun free zones” 
because they are cowards. They want to do the most damage, but 
don't want anyone to be able to defend themselves. We need to take 
the "target" off our schools. 
Locked doors, did you lock your house before you came to the Capital 
today? 
Trained personal, who is with the kids all day? Just like having some of 
the employees trained in ﬁrst aid. 
Recently, I was able to wander around a grade school because I didn't 
know where the office was. There were kids and teachers, and no one 
asked me what I was doing. I admit, I looked like a confused 
Grandmother, but what if I wasn't? I was uncomfortable with the 
situation but decided to continue to ﬁnd the ofﬁce on my own, just to 
see if anyone stopped me. Luckily, I was just dropping off some school 
supplies, but nobody asked my name or watched me leave the building 
This was a good example of a perfect situation for a catastrophic event. 
For the sake of our children, grandchildren and all future generations, 
please support these three bills. I never want to have a tragedy in 
Maine like other states have suffered. I never want the children of 
Maine to go thru this kind of trauma that you can help prevent. 
Thank you, 
Nancy Coshow /Z’
