Testimony for the 131st Session of the Maine Legislature 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
 
Public Hearing: April 26, 2023 
 
 LD. 518:  An Act to Allow Armed Security in Schools 
 
Chairperson Senator Joseph Rafferty and Representative Michael Brennan 
and Members of the Committee, my name is Suzanne Rudalevige and I 
live in Cape Elizabeth. 
 
I strongly oppose this bill. 
 I do not believe that having an armed person on school property is in the 
interests of safety for the employees and students.  The presence of a gun 
creates a risk. Having an armed guard at the school also carries with it the 
feeling of a place under siege. While shootings happen at schools, it is still 
rare and students do not need to be reminded all the time of this possibility. 
Such tragedies will not likely be prevented by an armed guard but by 
commonsense limitation of gun possession in our communities. 
Thank you.
