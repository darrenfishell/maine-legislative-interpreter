Our legislatures can take a direct action by voting for this bill to actually make a difference by 
enacting this law. It's widely known in the training world that to stop an active shooter you need 
equal or greater force to stop the killing. This bill would give the power to school districts to 
ensure the safety of their students and staff. Armed security personnel would add another layer 
of security to our schools, if approved by the local school board. 
Professional armed security or retired law enforcement ofﬁcers have years of experience 
spotting behaviors of concerns or red ﬂags. Their mindset and observations skills are different 
than school administrators or teachers. Having trained personnel that are armed is a deterrent 
and provides the school with another resource to identify observable behaviors of concern. 
School administrators, teachers, Ed Techs, School Nurses, Bus Drivers, SRO's and Armed Security 
Professionals working together and trained per an Emergency Action Plan would enhance the 
safety of students. 
History has shown repeatedly that drug free zones or gun free zones Do Not Work. You should 
ask the policymakers/legislatures what plan is in place if a gunman walks through the door of 
our school and starts shooting. The only answer to this question that would make the difference 
is a countermeasure with equal or greater force.

l’m not sure about this bill. I like the securing school aspect. I have to give the teachers propping 
open a door some thought. Training all staff and holding them accountable would take care of 
the problem. Alarms on doors if they're open to long. There's another issue with students 
opening doors for other people. Doors can be breached by shooting the glass out or locking 
device.
