LD 518
I am a mother and grandmother speaking out on behalf of my children and 
grandchildren. Having armed security guards in schools is NOT a solution to the 
epidemic of gun violence in our country, and I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to this 
legislation (LD518). Armed personnel in our schools will only increase the potential 
for more violence and trauma for students, parents and teachers -- This is WRONG!
