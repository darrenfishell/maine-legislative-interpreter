LD 518
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee,
I am writing to ask you to oppose LD 518.  There is no standard of training for 
security personnel.  If you want trained armed personnel in a school, the answer is a 
trained police resource officer.  Should the legislature feel it is important to have a 
police resource officer in every school, fund it.
Sincerely,
Gail  Witherill
