LD 518
To the distinguished members of the Education committee,
I am writing today to express my opposition to LD 52. I oppose allowing school 
boards to crease their own armed guards on public or private school grounds. This bill
even allows “volunteers” at no cost to the school board. It sounds like the sponsors 
are encouraging militia groups to take interest in “protecting” schools!
I have worked in schools and don’t find it smart to militarize our schools. It’s guns 
that are killing kids. More guns in schools is not the answer to the gun problem in our 
country.
Please vote against this bill.
Thank you,
