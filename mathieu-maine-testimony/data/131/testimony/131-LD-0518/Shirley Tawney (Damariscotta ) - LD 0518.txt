LD 518
I strongly urge you to oppose LD 118!
I am an educator, both as a teacher and an administrator for 5 decades!This 
experience was in Kansas, Vermont, Germany, Japan and Washington DC in 
Department of Defense schools.  This wide and varied experience form my opposing 
of Armed Security in Schools!  The results would bring diminished true educational 
safety and fear that exists now.
Thank you for your sincere consideration of my request !
