LD 518
I would like to add testimony on LD 518.  I am a retired Maine State Police Detective 
currently the Director of School Safety at Thornton Academy in Saco.  I qualify with 
the State Police at the Scarborough range twice per year and am certified to carry 
nationwide per federal law HR 218.  I was on the governor's protective detail for the 
last 9 years of my career and was on the King and Baldacci security team.  I feel that 
Maine has an enormous pool of retired full time police officers that could make our 
schools safer if allowed to carry weapons.  In the event of a school shooting here, I 
am on campus and would be able to protect our students and staff immediately.  With 
all the shortage in police staffing this could mean a substantial amount of lives saved 
in districts that would adopt this program. I believe that each school or district could 
make their own decisions to hire a retiree or not with passage of this bill.  I am in no 
way supportive of educators or non police personnel being armed, the training we go 
through is more than a set class or hours at a range.  The administration and Board of 
Trustees at Thornton support this and would allow me to carry if this is passed. I am 
not able to attend this hearing but would be available for any questions or thoughts.
