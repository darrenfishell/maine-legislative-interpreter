Vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 52, 1557 and 518 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Join Standing Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs, 
My name is Sue Kistenmacher and I am a retired high school and middle school science teacher, a 
volunteer nature educator, a mom and a grandmom. I occasionally enjoy target shooting and will readily 
accept venison from my friends who are hunters. I am not opposed to gun ownership, but I urge you to 
oppose LD 52, 1557 and 518/ 
1' 
Schools should be environments free of fear, violence, intimidation and guns and that is why Federal Law 
prohibits possession of a firearm in a school zone. 
LD 52, 1557 and 518 would make schools more dangerous places by allowing individuals to carry guns who 
don't have experience using them in high stress situations such as that of an active shooter. 
Teachers, principals and other school staff are educators, not police. 
I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 52, 1557 and 518.~
