Matt Drewette-Card
Topsham
LD 518
To Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Matt Drewette-Card. I am a resident of Topsham, Maine, a proud parent 
of two MSAD #75 students, and have been a practicing educator for more than 20 
years (including 5 years on the MSAD #75 School Board of Directors). I am 
submitting this testimony in opposition to LD 52, 518, and 1557 on behalf of myself 
only, and my testimony does not represent any school, district, or other organization 
to which I may be affiliated or connected.
I will keep this testimony short and simple: keep guns and weapons out of schools. 
Guns and weapons do not belong in schools, nor do they increase the safety and 
security of the students, educators, staff, or community members within the school 
building.
Please vote "Ought Not To Pass" on LD 52, 518, and 1557.
Respectfully and with thanks for your service to Maine,
Matt Drewette-Card
Topsham
