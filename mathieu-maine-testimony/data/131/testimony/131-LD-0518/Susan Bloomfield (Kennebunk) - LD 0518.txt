LD 518
Good morning, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the 
Education & Cultural Affairs Committee. Thank you for accepting my testimony. I 
am a resident of Kennebunk. I am opposed to LD 518. 
As written, this bill “…allows a school board to employ or engage by contract a 
school resource officer, private contractor or volunteer with applicable background 
and experience to provide armed security at a school within the school board's school 
administrative unit.”
I am deeply troubled at the concept of the State of Maine enabling a contractor or 
volunteer to perform these duties. In countless school shootings, trained law 
enforcement personnel have proved either precious or sadly, impotent, against a 
shooter with a powerful weapon. The idea of contracting pseudo-law enforcement 
officers for school duties is abhorrent.
No vigilantes in our schools! Let’s have clear heads about this issue, at least. 
Thank you.
