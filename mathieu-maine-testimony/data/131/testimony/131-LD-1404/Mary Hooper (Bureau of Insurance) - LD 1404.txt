Re: L.D. 1404, An Act Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover the Care of Expectant 
Mothers in Adoption Cases and Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 1404.  The purpose of this letter is to provide 
you with background information.  
This bill would require health insurance carriers to provide coverage or the option of coverage 
under the policy of an adoptive parent for the person giving birth to the child.  This coverage 
would include maternity and postpartum coverage for the duration of the pregnancy and through 
the 12 months following a birth.  The bill would allow an adoptive parent to pay for the health 
insurance coverage of the person giving birth to the child as part of an adoption proceeding.  The 
bill as drafted does not specify an effective date for this requirement.  
The bill appears to conflict with coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  
Currently the ACA allows coverage to be offered for the subscriber as well as the subscriber’s 
spouse, domestic partner and dependents up to age 26.  The IRS, Department of Labor, and the 
ACA define a dependent as a spouse, domestic partner, biological child, stepchild, adopted child 
(including children placed for adoption), or a foster child who is placed with the individual by an 
authorized placement agency or through a judgment, decree, or other order of any court of 
competent jurisdiction.   
There are public programs for persons whose income does not allow for the purchase of private 
insurance, such as MaineCare and CHIP, that cover pregnant women and newborns.  
Additionally, the adopting family could purchase coverage through the ACA Marketplace for the 
person bearing the child to be adopted. 
The Committee may want to consider how terms such as “unplanned” and “unexpected” are 
defined if it is intended to prevent use of this provision for intentional surrogacy situations. 
Last, the bill title says “and Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women” but there 
doesn’t appear to be any language to this effect in the bill.
