Senator Bailey Representative Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance & Financial Services Committee (HCIFS), thank you for the opportunity 
to present before you today. 
 
I’m Penny Morrell, from Belgrade and am in favor of LD L.D. 1404, “An Act 
Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover the Care of Expectant Mothers in 
Adoption Cases and Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women.”  
 
First, I want to thank Rep. Morris for sponsoring this bill. 
 
This bill is pro-life because it covers the cost of care for the baby in the womb and 
encourages adoption. 
It is pro-woman because it gives a woman experiencing an unplanned pregnancy 
healthcare and covers her costs through postpartum care. 
It is pro-family because it gives the new parents the opportunity to ensure their 
new baby has the best access to care from the beginning. 
Please vote L.D. 1404 “ought to pass”.  Thank you.
