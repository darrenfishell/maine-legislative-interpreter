LD 1404
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee. My name is Rob Poissant from  Gorham,ME. I 
come before you today to speak in Support LD 1404.
The reason for my support is that LD 1404 would cover the cost of care for a baby in 
the womb and would encourage adoption. As a person of faith, I believe that every 
human unborn and born baby is a person created by God and deserves love , to be 
nurtured and to be provided for. 
Allowing a woman experiencing an unplanned pregnancy ,the health care and 
postpartum care for her baby would allow a positive and life affirming choice and 
would provide her with opportunity to place the baby with an adoptive parent. The 
new parent would have the opportunity to ensure that their new baby has the access to
care from the beginning of their life and be welcome, loved and nurtured in a family.
 My experience as one of 7 in. a Maine family , my Pastoral Ministry experience and 
my life experience with families who have adopted  in our local Maine areas affirms 
 that LD 1404 is an overwhelming positive contribution and is in the best interest of 
all involved for the mother, the baby, and the family.
In conclusion  for these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 
1404.
Thank you!
