LD 1404
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee. My name is Janet LeBlanc, from Waterville, ME. 
Please  support LD 1404.
 
This bill has the best interest of the birth mother, the adoptive parent(s) and the 
preborn child.  It ensures all will preborn child and the mother will receive the proper 
medical care needed.  It allows for the adoptive parent to possibly pay for the health 
insurance.  Maineâ€™s death rate is higher than its birth rate.  This bill removes a 
possible obstetrical to choosing adoption.  Our laws need to support increasing the 
birth in Maine.  Requiring insurance companies to expectant mothers in adoption 
cases is good for Maine.
This bill is good for the birth mother, the preborn child, the adoptive parents, and for 
the people of Maine.  Please vote Ought to Pass on LD 1404.
Thank you
