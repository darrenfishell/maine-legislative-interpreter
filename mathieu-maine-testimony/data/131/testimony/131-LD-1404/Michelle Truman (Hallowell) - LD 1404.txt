LD 1404
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee:
My name is Michelle Truman of Hallowell.  I speak in SUPPORT of LD 1404, "An 
Act Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover the Care of Expectant Mothers in 
Adoption Cases and Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women".
I support this bill mainly because it helps to encourage adoption.  The costs of 
adopting a child are astronomical for parents, who nevertheless are willing to assume 
the costs and give the child a chance.  Love does such things!
With insurance companies covering the care for the expectant mother in an adoption 
case, it opens a window of HOPE for both the parents and the expectant mother.
I ask the Committee to vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1404.  Strike a blow for life!  
Thank you.
