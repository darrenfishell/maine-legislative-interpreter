SUPPORT - LD 1404 - An Act Requiring Insurance Companies to 
Cover the Care of Expectant Mothers in Adoption Cases and Provide 
Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Health 
Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee: 
My name is Sadie Brochu. I am a resident of Oakland, and I had the privilege of 
being adopted by my wonderful Dad and Mom. 
I was born with spina biﬁda, an opening in the spinal area, that required medical 
intervention. 
Thirty-two years ago, my birth mother may not have had easy access to prenatal 
healthcare. 
I stand before you today to §_y_pp_g_r__§_LD 1404 - An Act Requiring Insurance 
Companies to Cover the Care of Expectant Mothers in Adoption Cases and 
Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women. 
Giving a baby up for adoption is an act of love. 
Raising a baby is a labor of love. 
The adoptive parents may not know the birth mother, but if they do, with this 
new bill, they can work together to help the baby thrive by allowing important 
healthcare support. 
Thank you for considering my views. 
I am available to answer any questions.
