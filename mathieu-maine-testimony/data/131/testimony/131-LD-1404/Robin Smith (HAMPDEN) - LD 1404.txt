LD 1404
Dear Representatives and Senators, 
  I would like to let you know that LD 1404 is a very good bill, covering the care of 
expectant mothers in adoption cases. This measure would go a long way towards 
alleviating the mothers apprehension  or concerns about the cost of medical care, 
prenatal and delivery,  of having a baby. 
  I fully support it and commend any representatives for authoring it, co-sponsoring it,
and supporting it.
Thanks for your good work.
