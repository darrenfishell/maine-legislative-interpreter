Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and Members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee:
My name is Jean Hall from Buxton, ME.  I ask you to support LD 1404, HP 0900
As a retired nurse after 44 years advocating for my patients/clients health and welfare,
this bill would cover the cost of care for the baby in the womb.  It gives a woman 
experiencing an unplanned pregnancy essential healthcare and coverage through 
postpartum care.  This bill also gives the new parents the opportunity to ensure their 
new baby has access to care from the beginning.   
In closing please help insure the healthcare of the unborn baby and the mother.   For 
these reasons I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1404 HP0900.  Thank 
You!
Respectfully,
Jean Rioux Hall, RN, BSN
Buxton, ME
