LD 1404
Greetings to the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial services committee 
members. I want to recommend passage of LD 1404 so that all expectant mothers get 
medical insurance coverage when they deliver in all cases including giving the child 
up for adoption which is the best option for the child. Thank you for consideration of 
my testimony
