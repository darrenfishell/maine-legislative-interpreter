Meredith Kerr
North Yarmouth
LD 1404
Insurance Coverage for care in adoption cases, LD 1404
Position: Support
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee. My name is Meredith Kerr, from North Yarmouth,
ME. I come before you today to speak in Support LD 1404.
 
I am a retired grandmother who fears for the next generation regarding their 
understanding of the sacredness of life. Every support should be available to pregnant 
women who face an unwanted pregnancy, including the insurance coverage of those 
who are choosing adoption for their babies. This provision removes at least one 
barrier to the choice of adoption and shows society's willingness to provide for the 
post-birth needs of a new born and it's mother. It also sends the message to our 
children and grandchildren of the value our generation places on the unborn.  
 
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1404. 
Thank you!
