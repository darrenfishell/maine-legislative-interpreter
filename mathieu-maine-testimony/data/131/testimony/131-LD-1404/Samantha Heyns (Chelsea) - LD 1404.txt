LD 1404
I am writing in favor of LD 1404
One reason given for abortion is that it is too expensive to have and raise a child.  
Requiring Insurance Companies to cover the care of expectant mothers in adoption 
cases and providing notice of that coverage to pregnant women would take a huge 
burden of worry off, and make it as affordable to give a child up for adoption as it is 
to kill the baby in the womb.
Please vote yes on LD 1404.
Thank you,
