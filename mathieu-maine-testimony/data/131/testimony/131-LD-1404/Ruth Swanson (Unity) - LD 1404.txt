Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and 
members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Services committee 
My name is Ruth Swanson, I reside in 
Unity, Me. I come before you today 
to speak in support of LD 1404y 
" Pro- Choice " 
ends up meaning " No Choice 
but Abortion" 
Lets do all we can do to show Women the real 
choice both sides, keeping the child or having 
the Insurance companies to cover the care of 
expectant mothers in adoption cases, and let 
pregnant women, have notice of that coverage. 
Women who choose adoption and though it 
is difﬁcult, but have been left with a sense of 
peace knowing they have given someone the 
gift of life. 
I ask the committee to vote ought to pass on 
LD 1404 
Thank you
