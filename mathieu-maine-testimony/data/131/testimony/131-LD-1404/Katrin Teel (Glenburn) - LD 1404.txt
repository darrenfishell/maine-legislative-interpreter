Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services.  
 
I am Katrin Teel of Glenburn, Maine. I am here to testify in support of L.D. 1404, An Act 
Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover the Care of Expectant Mothers in Adoption Cases and 
Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women. 
As you know, if passed, L.D.1404 would require insurance carriers to provide coverage under 
the policy of an adoptive parent for the person giving birth to the child, not only through the 
duration of the pregnancy but also for the 12 months following the birth. This is a tremendous 
benefit to a woman experiencing an unplanned pregnancy! This would cover the cost of care for 
the baby in the womb and also encourage adoption. Additionally, this would give the new 
parents an opportunity to help ensure their new baby has the best access to care right from the 
beginning.  
 
Toward that end, I encourage you to vote Out to Pass on L.D.1404. Thank you for allowing me 
to contribute my testimony.
