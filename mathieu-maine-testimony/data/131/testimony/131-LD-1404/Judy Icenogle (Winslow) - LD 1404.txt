An Act Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover the Care of Expectant Mothers in 
Adoption Cases and Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women.
LD 1404
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee.
My name is Judy Icenogle from Winslow, Maine and I am writing this email to tell 
you of my support for LD 1404.
It covers the cost of care for the baby in the womb and encourages adoption.
It gives a woman experiencing an unplanned pregnancy healthcare and covers her 
costs through postpartum care.
It gives new parents the opportunity to ensure their new baby has the best access to 
care from the beginning.
Thank you for reading my email and I urge you to support LD 1404 by voting "ought 
to pass".
