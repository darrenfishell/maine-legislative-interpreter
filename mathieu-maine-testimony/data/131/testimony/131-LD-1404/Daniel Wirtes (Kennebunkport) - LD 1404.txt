Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee. My name is Daniel Wirtes from Kennebunkport 
Maine. I support this very important Bill and share my written testimony with you on 
LD 1404, HP0900.
 I married into a family of four adoptive people, my sister-in-law, her husband and 
son our Godson and my wife’s brother. I can’t imagine my life without these people 
who have been a blessing to me.  Adoption is an absolute alternative to the killing of 
innocent babies. Please vote to support this very important Bill.
Thank you,
