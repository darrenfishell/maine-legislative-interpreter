Armelle Sigaud
Rockland
LD 1404
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance
and Financial Services Committee,
My name is Armelle Sigaud. I live in Rockland, Maine.
I am writing to you today in support of LD 1404.
This bill is not just pro-life, it is also pro-woman and pro-family.
Why? First, because it helps the pregnant mother. It provides healthcare for a woman 
experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, and it covers her costs through postpartum 
care. In other words, during her pregnancy and until her baby blows the first candle 
on the birthday cake, that mother knows that she doesn't have to worry about paying 
for healthcare. Can you imagine her relief at such help? 
Secondly, this bill also gives new parents, including adoptive parents, the opportunity 
to ensure their new baby has the best access to care from Day One. 
Please vote "ought to pass" on LD 1404.
Thank you.
