LD 1404
Hi support LD1404 because it is a great bill which would encourage adoption rather 
than killing a baby. Many people are looking for a baby to adopt and this would make
more babies available for adoption. It would also be a great help to a woman 
experiencing an unplanned pregnancy because it would ensure that she wouldnâ€™t have
to worry about healthcare costs. Thank you.
