TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
LD 1404, HP 0900  
An Act Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover the Care of Expectant Mothers in Adoption 
Cases and Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women  
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee.   My name is Russell Brimmer, a 
resident and registered voter from Levant, ME.  I come before you today to 
speak in Support of LD 1404 , An Act Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover 
the Care of Ex pectant Mothers in Adoption Cases and Provide Notice of That 
Coverage to Pregnant Women . 
Finances play an important role for each of us in our daily lives.  The cost of 
prenatal and postnatal care is a significant issue for a pregnant woman.  This 
remains true whether the mother decides to raise her child herself or to allow 
her baby to be adopted by others.  If adoption is the choice, there are also 
significant financial ramifications for the adoptive family.  LD 1404 provides vital 
financial assistance to  assure the health of the mother and the new baby.  It 
recognizes the decision of the adoptive parents to undertake the long -term 
responsibility for a new child in their family.  It requires the adoptive family’s 
insurance to cover the cost of prenatal and  postnatal care for the birth mother.  
This helps all parties involved.  It is common for a birth mother to have limited 
financial resources , and t he availability of medical care can have a definitive 
effect on the mother’s choice to continue her pregnancy  or to abort her unborn 
baby.  This bill also helps assure the adoptive parents that their child receives 
the appropriate medical attention throughout the child’s development.  Lastly, it 
gives the baby the best possible opportunity for a healthy life.    
I encourage the committee to vote favorably on LD  1404.
