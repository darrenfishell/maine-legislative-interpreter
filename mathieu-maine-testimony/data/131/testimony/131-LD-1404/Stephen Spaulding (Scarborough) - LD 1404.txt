LD 1404, HP0900   An Act Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover the Care 
of Expectant Mothers in Adoption Cases and Provide Notice of That Coverage 
to Pregnant Women 
Position: Support 
 
Many women who find themselves unexpectedly pregnant donâ€™t know about the 
availability of medical coverage for their pregnancy, and have little understanding 
of how modern-day open or closed adoptions work. The bill in question requires 
health insurance providers to cover the maternity and postpartum expenses of the 
person giving birth to a child for the duration of their pregnancy and 12 months 
following childbirth under an individual or group health insurance policy of an 
adoptive parent. It also clarifies that an adoptive parent may pay for the healthcare 
coverage for the pregnant individual as part of an adoption proceeding. If choice is 
really desired for a woman, she needs to be aware of the availability of the choice 
to adopt out her child, and that her medical bills will be covered. This bill benefits 
both the unborn child and the birth mother by ensuring that the necessary 
healthcare costs are covered, encouraging adoption, and providing postpartum care 
for the mother. Additionally, it supports the new family unit by providing access to 
healthcare from the start, ultimately benefiting the well-being of the family as a 
whole. 
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1404. Thank 
you!
