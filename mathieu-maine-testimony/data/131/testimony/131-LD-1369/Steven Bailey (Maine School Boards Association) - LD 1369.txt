Michael Buescher, Esq., Chair TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO 
L.D. 1369 
AN ACT TO AMEND THE ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS AND 
SERVICES FUNDING FORMULA TO INCLUDE ALL COSTS 
FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF STUDENTS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cul- 
tural Affairs Committee. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine 
School Boards Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the 
Maine School Boards Association in opposition to L.D. 1369. 
The Maine School Boards Association views L.D. 1369 as a lofty goal but doesn’t 
see it as realistic given the current payment by the state of 55% of the cost of edu- 
cation. The bill indicates that transportation costs (100%) would be provided to 
each district, above and beyond the state share of the total allocation. This would 
include required secondary education transportation and all transportation to co- 
curricular and extracurricular activities. The timeframe for this bill would take ef- 
fect in 2024-2025. 
MSBA questions the ﬁscal impact this would have after the recalculation is done 
to shift costs from subsidizable costs to a guaranteed 100% payment of costs.
