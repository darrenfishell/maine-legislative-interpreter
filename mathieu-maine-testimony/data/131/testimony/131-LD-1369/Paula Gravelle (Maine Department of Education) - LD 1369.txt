Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 1369 , An Act to Amend the Essential Programs and Services Funding Formula to Include All 
Costs for the Transportation of Students , provides for  transportation costs for public school 
students which are to be paid by the state. This bill would cover 100% of school commuting and 
extra - and co -curricular activities.    
This bill proposes to change many aspects of the current funding for transportati on within the 
Essential Programs and Services (EPS)  funding formula. First, it would move the funding 
allocation from the “other subsidizable ” section  to a section of th e formula  where it would be 
100% state funded , with no local share. Second, it proposes to mandate the transportation of 
elementary  and secondary  students. And third, co - and extra -curricular activities are included in 
transportation.  
Currently, the EPS model includes some transportation funding as part of the “other 
subsidizable ” section of the formula.  As  described in Title 20 -A, Chapter 606 -B §15672 , 32-C 
Transportation operating costs “means all cost s incurred in the transportation of pupils in 
kindergarten to grade 12, including lease costs for  bus garage and maintenance facilities and 
lease -purchase costs that the school administrative unit may apply to the purchase of bus garage 
and maintenance facilities, when the leases and lease -purchase agreements have been approved 
by the commissioner, bu t excluding the costs of bus purchases and excluding all costs not 
associated with transporting students from home to school and back home each day. ” Local 
school administrative units ( SAUs ) receive funds towards these transportation costs as part of 
their state share and  are then responsible to use local funds to meet their  total transportation cost 
needs.   
The total amount of additional funds the Department estimates needing  in fiscal year 2024 is 
$60,150,343.41. This encompasses  the total state  share ($128,723,532.01)  and local share  
($57,925,589.40)  as indicated on SAU ED279 reports, as well as co -and extra -curricular 
transportation  ($2,224,754.01).  
Funding 100% of transportation costs for schools would be a significant expen se to the State.  In 
addition, the new data that would need to be collected by the Department  in order to accurately 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 8EB187EA-9289-4EE7-88DC-2D15EE5B04D1
calcu late the transportation needs for each SAU would be an ad ditional project requiring staff 
and funding .  It is also important to note the interconnectedness of EPS funding formula 
components. Individual component adjustments to the EPS formula always have positive and 
negative impacts on SAUs . Given the finite am ount of funding, a calculation to increase one 
segment will necessarily decrease another segment. It would be prudent to examine any one 
element in the context of a comprehensive study. In order to  make equitable decisions that cause 
the least harm to our SAUs, the Department will need to dedicate  additional  time and resources 
to analyze the implications of any change.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1369 , An Act to 
Amend the Essential Programs and Services Funding Formula to Include All Costs for the 
Transportation of Students  and respond to  any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
