Re: LD 886 – An Act to Allow Clerks  to Issue Absentee  Ballots  After the 3rd Business  
Day Before  Election  Day to Voters  Who have a Nonphysical  Disability  and Voters  
Who Support  a Person  with a Disability
Position: Neither For Nor Against
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is neither for nor against LD 1821 and we thank 
you for the opportunity to outline our points for your committee.
Members supported the addition of “or other” to Section 1.D(2), which will clarify that any 
disability is an allowable circumstance where any absentee ballot can be requested during 
the special circumstance period.  Clerks routinely do not ask for any detail when a voter 
claims a disability, so this will simply codify standard practice.
Clerks were strongly opposed to the addition of Section 1.D (5) and stated the following 
reasons:
The language is unclear and would allow almost anyone to be defined as a caregiver 
and thereby able to request a ballot during the special circumstances period.
Clerks haven’t received pushback from voters who don’t qualify for the special 
circumstances absentee ballot, since the current language is sufficient to handle 
those unforeseen circumstances.
Caregivers, like all other voters, have a robust opportunity to cast an absentee ballot 
since they can request one up to 3 months before election day.  Voters can call, 
request online, or send in a written application for an absentee ballot.
Municipal clerks across the state initiated the legislation about 10 years ago to 
establish the 3-business day cutoff, which was, and still is, critical time needed to 
prepare for election day.  Adding another class of voter who qualifies, with vague 
language, will erode this much-needed buffer and open the door to other classes of 
voters.

MunicipalitiesVoters are accustomed to the cut off established in statute, and change to those 
established practices adds confusion to the voters
This bill appears to be a response to a singular instance where an issue was raised 
by a voter.
