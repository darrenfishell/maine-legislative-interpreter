Testimony in support of LD 886:"An Act to Allow Clerks to Issue Absentee Ballots After 
the 3rd Business Day Before Election Day to Voters Who Have a Nonphysical Disability 
and Voters Who Support a Person with a Disability"
Dear Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, 
My name is Eric McVay and I live in Bangor, ME. I am a self-advocate, who is a person who 
lives with a disability. I am submitting this testimony today in favor of LD 886 because I think it 
is important for people who live with disabilities and their care givers to exercise their right to 
vote. 
I support this bill because sometimes when people who live with Intellectual and Developmental 
Disabilities are getting ready to go vote on election day some challenges might come up. Some 
of the challenges they might have is having the right support staff available on election day to 
help them read the ballot. Scheduling conflicts happen at the last minute for people all the time. 
Transportation to the polling place can become a challenge. Many people live in a part of Maine 
that does not have accessible transportation and they have trouble finding rides. 
If I, or my staff were to get sick at right before I would not be able to go vote because I would 
not have the support I need. Being able to get an absentee ballot right before election day would 
help make sure my right to vote is protected.  
It is important for people to vote even with unforeseen circumstances happen. I would ask 
members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee to vote Ought to Pass on this bill and 
give these people their chance to vote. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Eric McVay 
Bangor, ME
