Testimony in support of LD 886:"An Act to Allow Clerks to Issue Absentee Ballots After 
the 3rd Business Day Before Election Day to Voters Who Have a Nonphysical Disability 
and Voters Who Support a Person with a Disability"
Dear Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, 
My name is Kile Pelletier and I live in Fort Kent. I am a self-advocate meaning I am a person 
who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, Maine’s Self-
Advocacy Network. I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 886. 
People should have the right to have an absentee vote on or after the 3rd day so that they can have 
enough time to vote and have their voices heard. People with disabilities get pushed aside of 
issues and sometimes most of them have transportation issues to get to the polls to vote, or 
sometimes their staff gets too busy and then they can’t bring them. 
Having an absentee ballot after the 3rd business day would help people who have a disability be 
able to vote and they won’t have to go to the polls and try to find a ride. They can still have their 
right to vote and will be able to do it from their own home.  
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Kile Pelletier
