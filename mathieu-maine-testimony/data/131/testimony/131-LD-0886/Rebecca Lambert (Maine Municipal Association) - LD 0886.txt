Neither for Nor Against  
 
LD 886, An Act to Allow Clerks to Issue Absentee Ballots After the 3rd Business Day Before 
Election Day to Voters Who Have a Nonphysical Disability and Voters Who Support a Person 
with a Disability  
 
March 13, 2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony neither for nor against  
LD 886 on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative 
Policy Committee (LPC). For reference , the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA 
and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Local leaders across Maine recog nize and appreciate the inclusion of all people with 
disabilities, rather than solely a physical disability, to possess the ability of receiving an absentee 
ballot. There are a variety of nonphysical disabilities that could prevent an individual from going  
to the polls and the LPC supports this measure.  
Extending this ability to include caregivers of those with a nonphysical disability does give 
some municipal leaders pause. Exceptions already currently exist in statute and coupled with the 
ease of obtainin g an absentee ballot , that would ensure voters are able to participate in the 
process.  
 Further, by including such a broad definition of caregiver , it could potentially  lead to an 
erosion of this special exception. In that  same vein, local leaders recogniz e that living with an 
individual with a disability shape  the way the caregiver lives their life and is  therefore  also 
affected.  
Thank you for  your time and for  considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
