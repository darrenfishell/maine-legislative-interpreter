Testimony in support of LD 886:"An Act to Allow Clerks to Issue Absentee Ballots After 
the 3rd Business Day Before Election Day to Voters Who Have a Nonphysical Disability 
and Voters Who Support a Person with a Disability"
Dear Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, 
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate meaning I am a person 
who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, Maine’s Self-
Advocacy Network. I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 886 because I think 
everyone should have the right to vote. 
I think it is important that people should be able to get an absentee ballot if they are not able to 
vote on election day. This would be good for them so that they can still fill it out and get it back 
so if they can’t make it suddenly to the polls on election day, they can still have their vote count. 
Often times people do not have a ride or transportation because not everyone has a local bus they 
can take. If someone finds out at the last moment they do not have a ride to the polls then they 
won’t be able to vote. I think that voting is one of the biggest rights that people have and they 
should be able to vote no matter what even if they do have a disability and need support. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Jon McGovern
