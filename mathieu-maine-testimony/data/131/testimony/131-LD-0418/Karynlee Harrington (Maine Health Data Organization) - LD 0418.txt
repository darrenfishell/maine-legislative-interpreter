Karynlee Harrington, Executive Director 
Maine Health Data Organization 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance & Financial Services 
Public Hearing Date: February 16, 2023 
L.D. 418 
"Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of Portions of Chapter 100, Enforcement Procedures, 
a Major Substantive Rule of the Maine Health Data Organization" 
Senator Bailey and Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health Coverage, Insurance & Financial Services. My name is Karynlee Harrington; l am the 
Executive Director of the Maine Health Data Organization (MHDO) and the Maine Quality Forum 
(MQF). I am here today to present testimony in support of the proposed changes to MHDO’s 
Rule Chapter 100, Enforcement Procedures. 
Role of MHDO 
The Maine Health Data Organization (MHDO) is authorized by statute to collect health care 
data, including prescription drug price data. The purpose of the MHDO as deﬁned in Title 
22, Chapter 1683, is to create and maintain a useful, objective, reliable, and comprehensive 
health information database that is accessed by a broad group of authorized users to improve 
the health care quality and costs for Maine people; and to promote the transparency of the 
cost and quality of health care services and prescription drugs in the State through a publicly 
accessible website.
The Maine Health Data Organization is governed by a board of directors which includes 
representatives from the following stakeholder groups: Payers, Hospitals, Providers, Home 
Health Care, Consumers, Employers, and Government. 
I\/lHDO’s governing statute includes a provision regarding fines and enforcement actions for when 
a person or entity violates the requirements of this chapter. 
MHDO Rule Chapter 100, Enforcement Procedures, establishes the schedule of fines and other 
enforcement actions for failure to file clinical, quality, financial, health care claims and now 
prescription drug price data. Failure to pay the annual assessment; and intentional or knowing 
failure to protect the disclosure of confidential or privileged data is a violation of this chapter. 
This proposed rule change is necessary to align the enforcement requirements in Public Law 
2021, Chapter 603 and in 90-590 C.M.R. Chapter 247, with the enforcement provisions described 
in 90-590 C.M.R. Chapter 100: Enforcement Procedures. 
MHDO Board of Directors Public Hearing 
The MHDO Board of Directors (the board) met on April 7, 2022, and authorized MHDO to 
initiate major substantive rulemaking for Chapter 100. The proposed rule was publicly noticed 
on September 14, 2022, and a public hearing was held on October 6, 2022. No public 
comments were received at the public hearing or by the 10-day comment period deadline of 
October 17, 2022. The Board met on December 1, 2022, and unanimously voted to 
provisionally adopt the rule changes presented to you today.
..
Summary of Proposed Changes 
These proposed changes add a new provision under Section 3. Penalties; fines, for a payor that 
fails to file supplemental health care data sets and/or to meet the standards for data as defined 
in 90-590 Chapter 247. Additionally, the definitions for manufacturer and wholesale drug 
distributor have been updated to align the definitions in 22 MRS Chapter 1683 and 90-S90 C.M.R 
Chapter 570. Attached to my testimony is a Basis Statement that includes a description of each 
proposed change and the rationale for the change (Attachment A); and a copy of Rule Chapter 
100 with the proposed changes identified in track changes (Attachment B). 
This concludes my testimony. I would be happy to answer questions now or at the work session

clinical, quality, financial, restructuring, health care claims and prescription drug price data; 
failure to pay the annual assessment; and for intentional or knowing failure to protect the 
disclosure of confidential or privileged data. 
The proposed changes summarized below (except for updates to two definitions in Section 2) 
are a result of the new requirements in 24-A M.R.S. §6951, including those in PL 2021, c603, 
”An Act Regarding Reporting on Spending for Behavioral Health Care Services and To Clarify 
Requirements for Credentialing by Health Insurance Carriers" .

Prescription Drug Price Data Sets. 
Rationale: Uniformity in definitions across various agency rules. 
Section 3. Penalties; fines. (page 3) 
This proposed rule change is necessary in order to align the enforcement requirements in Public

described in 90-590 C.M.R. Chapter 100: Enforcement Procedures. These proposed changes
