  The former Roman Catholic Church in Lille, a village in Grand Isle located between Van Buren 
and Madawaska, is on the National Register of Historic Places and has been undergoing a 
restoration of the exterior and interior since 1983.   
  The village is agrarian, but the commercial economy of the village has declined.  The 
restoration project has employed dozens of workers and has prompted some growth with the 
rise of a farm to table restaurant / gift shop business just down the road. 
The former church is now a museum and acts as a cultural center, hosting performers, lectures 
and exhibitions.  We are also turning the former general store into an exhibition center housing 
part of our huge collection of local folk artifacts, which interpret the history and culture of the 
region.  The work is not completed yet, but it is close.  We excitedly support LD 912.
