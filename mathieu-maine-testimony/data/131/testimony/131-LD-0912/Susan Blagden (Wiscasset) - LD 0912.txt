To Whom it may concern: 
Many of our grandparents and parents attended the Wiscasset 
School Which Was housed for many years in What is now the 
Maine Art Gallery. The gallery Was started by historian and 
artist Mildred Burrage after the school moved. Miss Burrage 
was determined to preserve historic buildings in Wiscasset and 
to provide a forum for the arts in Midcoast Maine. 
The Maine Art Gallery is an important outlet for artists of all 
ages and media. It has been a valuable learning resource for 
many students and provides a venue for established 
professional artists to mentor developing talents. 
This historic building is part of the rich fabric of our town and 
is a “draw” for visitors from all over the country. The airy open 
space makes it possible to display works of art of all kinds to 
advantage.
