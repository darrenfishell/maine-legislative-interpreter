The Grand
LD 912
The Grand was built as a movie theater in 1938 as an anchor on Main Street, 
Ellsworth, Maine, to help rebuild the local economy after a fire devastated downtown.
In 1975, the building was "saved" from demolition and renovated into a multi-use 
venue by a passionate community theater group led by director Harris Strong. The 
Grand has experienced many renovation projects through the Belvedere Fund at the 
Maine Community Foundation, The Davis Foundation, and the Stephen and Tabitha 
King Foundation, helping to return it to its historic Art Deco design and The Grand is 
now on the National Historic Registry. But every year, repairs and maintenance is 
required to sustain its historic integrity, and it's never "cheap." The Grand required a 
storefront window replacement to the tune of $17,000, and as successful as the 
organization has been at increasing revenue and bringing people downtown, that still 
hobbled the recovery progress after 18 months of being closed due to pandemic 
restrictions. Restoration support of historic buildings like the 
Grand is not only important to Maine communities but also to Maine's unique 
identity.
