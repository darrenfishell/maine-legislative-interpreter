LD 1311
As marijuana has been found to have many physical and psychological benefits, I am 
in support of LD 1311. Marijuana can be an incredible tool to help individuals process
trauma allowing them to better themselves and their lives. Their betterment only 
betters the communities they live in and our state as a whole.
It's time we stop criminalizing a highly beneficial substance that has power to make 
the world live in a bit more harmony.
