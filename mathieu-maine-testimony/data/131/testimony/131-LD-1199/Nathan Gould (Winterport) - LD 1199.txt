Distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural 
Affairs,
I, Nathan Gould of Winterport, submit this testimony in favor of LD 1199, "An Act to
Provide Transparency in Public School Curricula." There are many other bills being 
heard that support the rights of parents, and I hope you will consider them as well.
Transparency and cooperation with parents should be a given for educators. It is 
unfortunate that we have reached the point were such basic principles need to be 
enforced by law, yet we have seen a flagrant disregard for parents' concerns in 
Damariscotta, Hermon, Windham, Hampden, and elsewhere across our state.
The right of parents, as the primary caretakers of their children, to guide and oversee 
their children's education must be protected, especially considering the turbulent 
social climate in which we find ourselves.
I ask the Committee to respect the parents and guardians of our State and vote Ought 
to Pass. Thank you for your time.
