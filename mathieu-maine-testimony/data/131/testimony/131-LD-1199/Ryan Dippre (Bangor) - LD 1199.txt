LD 1199
I am writing in opposition to LD 1199: “An Act to Provide Transparency in Public 
School Curricula.”  This act does nothing but add a level of complication to the work 
of running a public school by demanding that schools share their entire curricula by 
October 1 of each year.  It does not provide funding for this.  It does not provide 
guidance for how this material will be organized and shared.  It provides no 
infrastructure to schools for doing this work.  It does not make clear how parents will 
be able to review it, and what the process will be for them to complete that review.  It 
does not make clear how schools are to take up feedback by parents (if indeed 
feedback is given).  It is an undeveloped bill that in no way deals with the 
consequences of its enactment, and therefore ought not to pass.
