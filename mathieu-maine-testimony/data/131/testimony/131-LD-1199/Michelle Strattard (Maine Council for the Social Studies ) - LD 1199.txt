Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs
Committee.
My
name
is
Nicole
W illard
and
I
am
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
for
the
Maine
Council
for
the
Social
Studies
(“MCSS”).
MCSS
is
the
lar gest
professional
or ganization
for
social
studies
teachers
in
the
State
of
Maine
and
we
are
af filiated
with
the
National
Council
for
Social
Studies
(“NCSS”),
the
lar gest
professional
or ganization
for
social
studies
teachers
in
the
United
States.
One
of
the
goals
of
MCSS
is
to
“provide
institutional
representation
for
the
interests
of
and
concerns
of
social
studies
educators”.
I
am
submitting
this
testimony
on
behalf
of
the
board
and
members
of
MCSS
in
opposition
to
L.D.
1 129
and
LD
1 199.
The
MCSS
Board
unanimously
opposes
LD
1 129
and
LD
1 199.
Either
of
these
bills,
if
enacted,
would
place
additional
burden
on
teachers
and
school
districts
that
are
already
overworked.
Much
of
what
these
bills
ask
for
is
already
available
from
schools
and
teachers.
Most
teachers
use
multiple
ways
of
connecting
with
parents
about
curriculum
such
as
web
pages,
conferences,
emails,
online
grading
portals,
and
open
house
nights.
If
parents
have
questions
about
the
curriculum,
then
they
are
able
and
often
do
contact
the
teacher
or
school.
T eachers
are
trained
to
dif ferentiate
instruction
and
they
often
need
to
make
revisions
and
changes
to
units
and
lessons
in
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
their
students.
This
bill
makes
the
assumption
that
teachers
rely
on
a
kit
that
is
never
changing
throughout
the
school
year .
Having
to
publish
and
stick
to
a
curriculum
because
it
was
what
was
published
could
stifle
a
teacher ’ s
ability
to
meet
students
where
they
are.
This
should
remain
in
the
control
of
local
school
districts
where
administrators,
parents,
and
teachers
can
meet
to
discuss
the
educational
value
of
curriculum
and
determine
the
appropriateness
for
their
children
and
community .
T eachers
and
administrators
should
be
able
to
focus
their
time
and
ener gy
on
the
students
in
their
schools
and
not
on
a
state
mandate
that
adds
additional
burdens
to
educators,
and
will
not
improve
the
educational
experience
of
students.

The
Maine
Council
for
Social
Studies
ur ges
the
Committee
to
vote
Ought
Not
to
Pass
on
LD 
1 129
and
LD
1 199.
W e
are
also
concerned
about
the
impact
of
the
requirements
about
professional
development.
It
is 
unclear
if
it
applies
just
to
district
provided
professional
development
or
any
development
a 
district
might
pay
for
a
teacher
to
attend.
As
an
or ganization
that
hosts
an
annual
conference
the 
idea
that
districts
would
not
be
able
to
pay
for
teachers
to
attend
unless
all
materials
can
be 
posted
for
the
schools
places
an
undue
burden
on
the
teachers,
districts
and
us
as
an
or ganization. 
It
would
require
permissions
from
all
our
presenters
to
share
their
work
publicly
to
people
who 
did
not
pay
to
attend
their
sessions.
