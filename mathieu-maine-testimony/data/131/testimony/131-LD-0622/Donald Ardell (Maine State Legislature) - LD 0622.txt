February 28, 2023 
To the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology co-chairs Senator 
Mark Lawrence and Representative S. Paige Zeigler, and esteemed members of the 
committee, I offer my thanks for taking the time to allow me to introduce LD 622, "An 
Act to Create Equal Opportunity Access to Clean Energy by Removing the 100-megawatt 
Limit on Clean Energy Sources" . My name is Donny Ardell, and I represent House 
District 6. 
Policy adopted by Maine in 1999’s Title 35 -A, Chapter 32, subsection 3210 reads: 
“Policy. In order to ensure an adequate and reliable supply of electricity for Maine 
residents and to encourage the use of renewable, efficient and indigenous resources, it is 
the policy of this State to encourage the generation of electricity from renewable and 
efﬁcient sources and to diversify electricity production on which residents of this State 
rely in a manner consistent with this section. ” 
Subsection 3210 l—A continues to state the Maine State renewable energy goals include 
percentages of retail sales of electricity coming from renewable sources be 80% by 2030, 
and 100% by the start of 2050. 
Subsection 3210 B-3(1) goes on to deﬁne “Renewable Capacity Resource ” as a source of 
electrical generation that relies on a list of six sources whose power production capacity 
does not exceed 100 megawatts: (a) Fuel cells, (b) Tidal power, (d) Geothermal 
installations; (e) Hydroelectric generators that meet all state and federal ﬁsh passage 
requirements applicable to the generator, (f) Biomass generators that are fueled by Wood, 
wood Waste or landﬁll gas; and (g) Anaerobic digestion of by-products of waste from 
animals or agricultural crops, food or vegetative material, algae or organic refuse. 
Subsection 3210 B-3(2), amended in 2019, follows, designating wind and solar power 
House District 6
installations as not subject to the 100 megawatt limit to be considered as Renewable 
Capacity Resources. 
The intent of these designations of sources of electrical generation, by past legislatures, is 
clearly to limit hydropower and other competing sources of energy generation and 
prioritizing solar and wind, designating them as Renewable Capacity Resources with no 
limit, a tactic that is apparently satisfying the “diversify electricity production ” clause in 
Maine’s energy policy in the beginning the section. 
However, is diversity in sources of electrical generation for the sake of diversity best for 
Maine, and Mainers‘? Does it provide for diversity but inadvertently encourage the use of 
nonrenewable energy sources? By providing advantages to wind and solar, are We 
removing free market forces that would choose the most “adequate and reliable ” sources 
of power for Maine, as the policy also requests? Predictably, solar power installations 
that are only fueled by solar energy, during the day, are unable to produce electricity at 
night. Were Maine a location with high demand for home and business cooling during 
the day, as southem states are, I ’d agree that solar electricity generation is a wise energy 
choice. But Maine is far more reliant on Winter heating than summer cooling, and during 
the winter months, when the nights are longest and when Mainers’ home heating needs 
are the highest, solar is taking the night off. Wind power generation, similarly, but less 
predictably, is inconsistent in that it does not produce electricity when the wind is moving 
in insufficient volume to transfer that kinetic energy to a moving turbine. And yet 
Mainers’ winter electricity demand continues, regardless of whether the sun is shining or 
if the wind is blowing. By way of example, on the coldest winter night of 2022 in 
Aroostook County, the overnight low air temperature was -35 degrees Fahrenheit, and the 
wind speed was zero. Neither the sun was shining nor the wind blowing, and yet 
Mainers’ winter home heating energy needs were the highest. 
Ironically, when wind and solar are not producing, backup generators powered by natural 
gas or diesel are used to make up the deﬁcit. If wind and solar are continued to be 
prioritized, unless a change is made, Maine will be able to reach neither its 2030 goal of 
80%, nor its 2050 goal of 100%, of renewable energy, and natural gas and diesel 
generation backup will continue to be relied on. By de-incentivizing the six other 
Renewable Capacity Resources in Subsection 3210 B-3(1), we are in fact incentivizing 
the use of natural gas and diesel generators. 
Hydropower, however, would have been running that cold winter night, capturing kinetic 
energy through water ﬂow day and night, every night. Hydropower is a source of energy 
that is inexpensive, clean, and available for sale from nearby Canada where Winter 
House District 6
snowfall provides a predictable and reliable source of snow melt-off and river ﬂow. 
While not an indigenous resource, nearby Canada’s ability and willingness to sell 
hydropower-generated electricity to Maine would provide a “renewable and efficient ” 
resource. Wildlife engineers have designed efficient ﬁsh ladders, that aside from 
permitting the ﬁsh safe passage upstream to spawn, also allow wildlife biologists, 
through sensors in the ﬁsh ladder, to track and conduct counts of salmon implanted with 
transmitters. For salmon young who return to the ocean, wildlife engineers have 
designed bypass routes to keep them from having to travel through the turbines. Best of 
all, hydropower needs no natural gas or diesel backup. 
To return to Maine’s stated energy policy, economy to the consumer is not mentioned, 
and apparently not considered. Maine’s seniors, veterans, and disabled, living on ﬁxed 
incomes, pensions, and Social Security, are reliant on our sound decision-making. In 
closing, I’d like to suggest Maine’s energy policy, one that emphasizes an “adequate and 
reliable ” supply for Maine residents, and that encourages the use of “renewable, efﬁcient, 
and indigenous resources ” , While prioritizing Wind and solar, is in fact creating a 
structure in which the least reliable sources of power are creating an increased need for 
backup natural gas and diesel power generation. 
Thank you for your time, and careful consideration of this bill. 
Sincerely, 
Donald J. Ardell

The Next Energy Battle: Renewables vs. 
Natural Gas.

Byline: Ivan Penn 
Dominion Energy, one of the nation's largest utilities, in late June erected wind turbines off the Virginia 
coast - only the second such installation in the United States - as part of a big bet on renewable 
energy. 
The company is also planning to build new power plants that burn natural gas. 
Utilities around the country are promoting their growing use of renewable energy like hydroelectric 
dams, wind turbines and solar panels, which collectively provided more power than coal-fired power 
plants for the first time last year. But even as they add more green sources of power, the industiy 
remains deeply dependent on natural gas, a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and is likely to 
remain a cornerstone of the electric grid for years or even decades. 
Utilities maintain that they need to keep using natural gas because the wind and the sun are too 
unreliable. They are also reluctant to invest in energy storage, arguing that it would cost too much to 
buy batteries that can power the grid when there isn't enough sunlight or wind. 
"We've got to have a resource that has an ‘on’ and ‘off’ switch," said Katharine Bond, vice president for 
public policy and state affairs at Dominion. 
For years, environmental activists and liberal policymakers fought to force utilities to reduce coal use 
to curb emissions and climate change. As the use of coal fades, the battle lines are rapidly shifting, 
with the proponents of a carbon-free grid facing off against those who champion natural gas, an 
abundant fuel that produces about half the greenhouse gas emissions that burning coal does. 
Coal plants supply less than 20 percent of the country's electricity, down from about half a decade 
ago. Over that same time, the share from natural gas has doubled to about 40 percent. Renewable 
energy has also more than doubled to about 20 percent, and nuclear plants have been relatively 
steady at around 20 percent. 
Experts argue that the surge in wind and solar energy, while impressive, is not reducing emissions 
quickly enough to avert the worst effects of climate change, including more intense heat waves and 
storms. They argue that utilities urgently need to reduce the use of natural gas, too. 
"Replacing coal with gas doesn't solve our public health problem," said Mary Anne Hitt, national 
director of campaigns at the Sierra Club.
Proponents of renewable energy note that solar panels are increasingly the cheapest source of 
electricity. Solar panels can deliver power to 650 homes for one hour - one megawatt-hour in industry 
jargon - at $31 to $111 a megawatt-hour, according to Lazard, the investment firm. By comparison, 
natural gas peaking plants, which utilities can turn on and off quickly to meet surging demand, deliver 
power at $122 to $162 a megawatt-hour. 
A report in June by the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that by 2035, the U.S. electric grid 
could get 90 percent of its power without greenhouse gas emissions while lowering electricity rates. To 
do that, the country would have to increase its use of renewables, energy storage and transmission 
lines while closing all coal plants and slashing natural gas use by 70 percent. 
Some lawmakers argue that utilities are wasting billions of dollars by investing in natural gas plants 
that will have to be shut down before their useful lives end. 
"The urgent need to address the climate crisis means we can't make reckless investments now that 
will have to be paid off for decades," said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and 
one of the authors of the legislation known as the Green New Deal. "We have to consider clean 
options, which, fortunately for consumers, are also cost-effective." 
Some experts say they hope that the country can move away from fossil fuels in part because the use 
of renewables has grown even as the Trump administration has repealed environmental regulations 
and pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. 
"Fighting the transition is not going to stop the transition," Dennis Wamsted, an analyst for the Institute 
for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said. "Economically, it will happen inevitably." 
Utility executives acknowledge that renewable energy will continue to grow. But many dismiss the idea 
that wind turbines, solar panels and batteries can replace natural gas plants. 
Great River Energy, a Minnesota utility owned by its customers, recently gained national attention 
when it said it would phase out coal use. The cooperative plans to shut down a 40-year-old plant in 
Underwood, N.D., called Coal Creek after failing to sell it. 
"The situation that led to our decision was based purely on the economics," said David Saggau, 
president and chief executive of Great River Energy. "lt has been tougher and tougher for some of our 
legacy facilities to compete in the marketplace." 
The Unden/vood plant and a nearby coal mine that supplies it employ about 660 people, many of 
whom will probably have to leave the area to find new jobs, said Underwood's mayor, Leon 
Weisenburger Jr. "lt's going to hurt those communities severely," he said. "Some won't sun/ive." 
But while Great River plans to increase its reliance on wind turbines, it is not giving up fossil fuels and 
will convert its other coal-ﬁred power plant to natural gas. 
Another large utility, the Alabama Power Company, won approval in June to replace some of its coal- 
fired plants with the equivalent of two large natural gas facilities, even as its parent, the Southern 
Company, has proposed to make its entire system carbon neutral by 2050. The utility and regulators 
gave little consideration to renewables and batteries. 
Even where elected leaders have committed to eliminating emissions, utilities have found it difficult to 
rid themselves of fossil fuels. 
Mayor Eric Garcetti, for example, wants Los Angeles to have an all-renewable electric grid by 2045. 
But the city-owned utility, the Department of Water and Power, still gets about 18 percent of its 
electricity from a coal-ﬁred plant in Utah and about 30 percent from natural gas plants.
It will take five years for the city to end its reliance on coal and much longer to wean it from natural 
gas. Officials said they would like to move more quickly, but Los Angeles owns some power plants 
with neighboring municipal utilities and has had to resolve labor contracts, plan the use of 
transmission lines and line up other energy sources. 
Dominion Energy, with more than seven million customers and operations in 20 states, said it had high 
expectations for offshore wind farms, which have been widely used in Europe for years. The company 
is erecting two wind turbines off Virginia Beach this year - with blades as high as 620 feet above sea 
level - as a test for the installation of nearly 200 turbines over the next six years. 
While environmental groups have long criticized Dominion's record, executives say they are 
committed to a greener grid and are planning to shut two coal-fired plants in Virginia in 2024 before 
either turns 30. Last year, the company closed six coal plants and converted five to natural gas, a fuel 
it views as complementary to renewables.' 
Investors, customers and lawmakers are demanding electricity from cleaner sources. In April, Gov. 
Ralph Northam of Virginia signed a bill requiring almost all coal-fired power plants to close by 2024 
and the state to become a carbon-free electricity producer by 2050. 
On Sunday, Dominion and Duke Energy announced that they had canceled the Atlantic Coast 
Pipeline, which would have crossed the Appalachian Trail, after legal challenges drove up the project's 
cost to $8 billion from about $4.5 billion. The two utilities said they had proposed the project "in 
response to a lack of energy supply and delivery diversiﬁcation for millions of families, businesses, 
schools, and national defense installations across North Carolina and Virginia." 
At the same time, Dominion announced a separate deal to sell all of its gas transmission and storage 
to an affiliate of Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy. 
From Dominion's perspective, its growing focus on clean energy should not have surprised anyone 
because the utility said it was a pioneer in the use of technologies like energy storage. In the 1980s, it 
built a power plant near Lexington, Va., that can use excess electricity to pump water to a reservoir at 
a higher elevation. When power is needed, the company can release water to a lower reservoir. The 
company said the six-turbine facility was the largest of its kind, able to power up to 750,000 homes 
and less expensive to operate than a bank of lithium-ion batteries. 
Executives said such plants could be built only in certain areas, so Dominion is also investing in 
batteries. But the company said it had concluded that the current generation of batteries was still too 
expensive and could generally store only up to five hours of power for the grid. 
"Natural gas remains the only resource that allows us to ratchet up and down," said Ms. Bond, the 
Dominion policy executive. "We're absolutely committed to investments in renewable energy- 
gigawatts' worth of wind, gigawatts' worth of solar. We're also committed to keeping the lights on for 
our customers."
