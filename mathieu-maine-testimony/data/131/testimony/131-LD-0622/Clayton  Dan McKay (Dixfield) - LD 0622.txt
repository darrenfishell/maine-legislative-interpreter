Another Failure, When does it end???
 " A 2020 rulemaking proceeding (Docket No. 2020-00212) resulted in changes to 
Chapter 311 to implement the new thermal energy credit portfolio (TREC) 
requirement. 2021 was the first year with a TREC requirement. The Commission only
approved five TREC projects by the end of May 2022. As a result of inadequate 
TREC supply in the marketplace, the bulk of the TREC obligation was fulfilled by 
Alternative Compliance Payments (ACP), equaling approximately $700,000. As 
required by statute, the Commission forwarded the ACP money to the Efficiency 
Maine Trust. " Maine PUC 2022 Annual Report
