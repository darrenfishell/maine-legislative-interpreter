“An
Act
Requiring

Refer endum

the
Former
Maine
Flag”
Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover ,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on 
State
and
Local
Government,
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
regarding
LD 
1069.
V exillology
is
the
scientific
study
of
the
history ,
symbolism,
and
usage
of
flags.
The 
North
American
V exillological
Association
conducted
an
opinion
survey
in
2002
of
State, 
T erritorial,
and
Provincial
flags
of
North
America.
Maine’ s
current
flag
design
came
in
60th
out 
of
72.
The
North
American
V exillological
Association
also
highlights
five
key
points
of
flag 
design
compiled
by
T ed
Kaye
and
twenty
other
expert
vexillologists
in
the
publication
Good 
Flag,
Bad
Flag
.
They
are
as
follows: 
1.
Keep
It
Simple:
The
flag
should
be
so
simple
that
a
child
can
draw
it
from
memory . 
2.
Use
Meaningful
Symbolism:
The
flag's
images,
colors,
or
patterns
should
relate
to
what 
it
symbolizes. 
3.
Use
2
or
3
Basic
Colors:
Limit
the
number
of
colors
on
the
flag
to
three
which
contrast 
well
and
come
from
the
standard
color
set. 
4.
No
Lettering
or
Seals:
Never
use
writing
of
any
kind
or
an
or ganization's
seal. 
5.
Be
Distinctive
or
Be
Related:
A void
duplicating
other
flags,
but
use
similarities
to
show 
connections.
When
Old
T own,
Maine
was
choosing
their
municipal
flag
in
2021,
they
highlighted
the 
importance
of
these
principles
stating
in
a
resolution:
“The
simplicity
of
the
design
is 
intentional.
The
flag
has
three
colors,
one
central
char ge,
and
little
else.
At
once,
the
design
looks 
old
and
new .
The
char ge
has
a
deep
meaning,
and
it
will
be
instantly
recognizable
to
Mainers
as 
Old
T own’ s
flag.
W e
believe
this
symbol
has
the
ability
to
represent
the
past,
present,
and
future 
citizens
of
Old
T own.”

I
believe
the
simplicity
and
meaningful
symbolism
of
the
former
state
flag
is
better 
representative
of
the
beauty
and
uniqueness
of
the
State
of
Maine.
Citizens
of
Maine
should
be 
given
a
choice
between
the
current
State
Seal
on
a
blue
background
used
by
countless
states
and 
the
simplistic
yet
meaningful
design
of
the
former
state
flag.
