RE:L.D. 833 – An Act to Prohibit Persons Who Donate to a Governor's Transition Committeeand Inaugural Committee from Registering as Lobbyists
Good morning Senator Hickman and Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and LegalAffairs Committee.
My name is Paul Lavin.  I’m a resident of Winthrop. I am here today as a volunteer for Maine Citizens forClean Elections. I am testifying neither for nor against L.D. 833.
Maine Citizens for Clean Elections has been the leading campaign finance organization in Maine for overtwenty years and one of the nation’s most respected state-based organizations advocating fordemocratically funded elections and campaign finance laws that serve the public interest. We are proudof our national reputation. But we are all Mainers, and our nonpartisan mission has always been withand for the people of this state.
We generally support efforts to ensure separation between political contributions and the formation ofpublic policy. We also support efforts to mitigate “the revolving door” problem – where public officialsmove back and forth between public service and paid advocacy. The revolving door raises ethicalquestions because it allows a public official to leave a position of unbiased service in the public interestand immediately begin advocating for a private agenda, usually lobbying the official’s former colleagueson the same issues. Often those in the revolving door are paid well by private interests for theconnections and expertise they developed at taxpayer expense.
The first subsection of L.D. 833 would make a minor change in current law. It would add the followingunderlined phrase to the prohibition already in 3 MRS §318-A:1
A person may notregister as a lobbyist or lobbyistassociate orengage in activities that require
registration as a lobbyist or lobbyist associate as defined by section 312
‑
A, subsections 10 and
10
‑
A, respectively, if that person has within the previous 12 months been employed in a positionfor which the salary is subject to adjustment by the Governor under Title 2, section 6 or that is
1Section 318-A was signed into law on June 18, 2013.

described as a major policy-influencing position under Title 5, chapter 71.  A person who violatesthis subsection may be assessed a fine of $100 for every day the person engages in lobbying.
This would apply the existing ban in §318-A not only to lobbying activities, but also to the very act ofregistering as a lobbyist. We don’t believe this change will affect many people since it is hard tounderstand why someone would register as a lobbyist unless they also engage in lobbying activities.2
The second part of the bill would prohibit anyone who had donated to a transition or inauguralcommittee of a governor-elect from lobbying for the duration of the governor’s term. Prior to the 2015Clean Elections citizen initiative, fundraising activity by gubernatorial inaugural or transition committeeswas not public information. MCCE was the leading advocate for requiring these committees to reportthat information. The donors reported by the 2023 inaugural committee as a result of that new law arelisted at the end of this testimony.
Donations to the transition or inaugural committee of a governor-elect may be perceived as incurringfavoritism from the new administration and a ban on donors from lobbying the administration may helpmitigate that appearance.  However, we read the bill as prohibitingindividualsfrom registering aslobbyists if they donate to a committee. As the attached list shows many of the donors to an inauguralcommittee will likely be businesses, organizations, and lobbying firms that hire or employ lobbyists.  Thebill would have no impact on businesses and firms that donate to a transition or inaugural committee.
The ban in §318-A(2) would prohibit individuals who donated to these committees from subsequentlylobbying that governor and their administration. However, the proposed lobbying ban would also applyto lobbying legislators and the other constitutional officers (i.e., the Secretary of State, Attorney Generaland State Treasurer). Those officials probably don’t feel the same benefit (or indebtedness) from adonation to the gubernatorial transition or inaugural committee, and therefore the proposed ban mightnot have the same justification when it comes to lobbying those officials.3
We honor the sponsor’s interest in separating political donations from policymaking and in seeking toaddress the appearance problem of currying favor from public officials. However, it is important to makeany rules consistent across all groups of public officials and all types of political donations. The sameappearance problem that arises in connection with a donation to an inaugural committee can be just astroubling when it arises in connection with a contribution to a candidate, caucus PAC or leadership PAC.If those who donate to an inaugural committee are banned from lobbying, why not apply the same ruleto those who contribute to other recipients who are equally involved in the process of making law andpolicy?
Maine recently enacted a partial ban on contributions from lobbyists to elected officials and candidatesfor office. 1 MRS §1015-A; PL 2019, c. 534, §4. The ban has many loopholes, including allowing lobbyists
3The bill, if enacted, also raises issues of fairness and retroactivity as it would impose an immediate lobbying banduring the current governor’s term on individuals who donated to the inaugural committee.2There are five references to “registered lobbyist” in Maine law but it is not clear whether any of them creates anintentional distinction between the act of registration and the act of actual lobbying.

to make contributions from money provided by their clients, or contributions directly from the lobbyistemployer to a legislator’s campaign.Perhaps a fullreview of existing prohibitions and those contained in4
this bill should be conducted to ensure a comprehensive approach and consistency across all offices andcontributors. We see L.D. 833 as an attempt to separate political donations from policymaking and toaddress the revolving door problem, and we support that effort. However, we might prefer the morecomprehensive approach to the one presented by this bill.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I would be happy to answer any questions.
4LD 833 would prohibit a contributor from becoming a lobbyist, whereas the law enacted in 2019 prohibits alobbyist from becoming a contributor (under certain circumstances). There may be subtle differences between thetwo approaches that the committee may wish to explore.
