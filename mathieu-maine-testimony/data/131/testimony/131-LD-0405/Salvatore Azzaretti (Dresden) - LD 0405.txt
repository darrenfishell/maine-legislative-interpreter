Senator Beebe-Center , Representative Salisbury , and
members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Committee: my name is Sal Azzaretti, I'm from Dresden,
and I am a 3rd Grade Teacher at Great Salt Bay
Community School in Damariscotta, and I am writing in
support of
LD 405, An Act to Prevent False Reporting
Leading to Evacuation, Shutdown or Lockdown.
In December , on the last day of school before Christmas
break, as students were beginning to head down to the
gymnasium for our Holiday assembly , an announcement
was made over the intercom to evacuate the building and
go to the local YMCA. Staf f members and students filed
out of the building and met back up in the basketball
courts.
Once there, we were informed that there had been a bomb
threat and that school had been canceled for the rest of
the day . This was a traumatic experience for the students,
who did not understand how or why this happened, or why
they were missing out on an important school and
community event. Little did we know at the time that this
was just the beginning, and would happen two more times.
It has gotten to the point where some students expect
more threats to happen, which is disruptive to their
learning and harmful to their mental health.
It is frustrating that teaching students of a generation that
have been exposed to incessant school shootings, now
we have to bear the burden of seemingly non-stop bomb
threats as well. It is unfair to the school staf f, students, and
community , and negatively af fects each and every one of
us. School does not feel safe. Staf f members, and
especially students, should not have to feel afraid to come
to school.
Our administration and our local law enforcement have
limited options to prevent the continuation of this abuse of
our community . We need our elected of ficials to step up
and give them options. I urge you to vote Ought to Pass
on LD 405.
