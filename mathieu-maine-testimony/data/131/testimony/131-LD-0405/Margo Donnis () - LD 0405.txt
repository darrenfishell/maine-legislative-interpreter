I approve these tighter penalties for a false reporting of a school attack that results in a
lockdown. I was so shocked last November when the schools were locked down in 10
Maine communities. Some students were texting "I love you" to their parents, as they 
were not sure they would survive. We need to heavily punish anyone who calls in 
these hoaxes. We need to support our students and families in any way we can.
