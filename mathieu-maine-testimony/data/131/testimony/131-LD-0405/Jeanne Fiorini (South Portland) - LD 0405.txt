I am urging you to support this bill to increase the penalty for creating any situation which 
results in evacuation, shutdown, or lockdown of our schools.
Not only is such an act a waste of time and resources, it creates a situation that no parent, 
teacher, or student should have to endure...  in any case. Until a ban on assault weapons 
passes (an immediate step in the right direction) and better mental health awareness is 
brought to families and the community (a long-term plan to help alleviate this rampant 
behavior) we need to send the message that  any prank or malicious act replicating this 
horrible type of event will not be tolerated.
Thank you.
