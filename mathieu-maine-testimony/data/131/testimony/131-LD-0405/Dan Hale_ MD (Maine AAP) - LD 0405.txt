LD 405
I am writing in support of L.D. 405, “An Act to Prevent False Reporting Leading to 
Evacuation, Shutdown or Lockdown.”
I am pediatrician living in Kittery, Maine and am a member of the Maine Chapter of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics Board of Directors.  I was working at 
Portsmouth Regional Hospital during one of the December 2022 school shooting false
alarms. Our team was enacting plans to be ready for multiple casualties. This was 
very upsetting for us because my daughter and several of our children were at nearby 
schools during this time. In addition to the emotional harm for all of the people at 
those schools, that was also a high-risk potential safety event for those people and 
responding personnel. Luckily no one was harmed but it certainly gave us the 
experience of what it would be like to be in an active shooter situation.
L.D. 405 will help deter false alarms and is an additional step to keep our children and
all citizens safe.
L.D. 405 is non-partisan legislation, supported by both Democratic and Republican 
Maine legislators, as is consistent with the bipartisan support of similar legislation 
enacted in both “blue” and “red” states.
Thank you for keeping our communities safe,
Dan Hale, M.D.,FAAP, SFHM
