Testimony in support of LD 1829, An Act to Reduce Prescription Drug Costs by 
Requiring Reference-based Pricing 
 
 
I am testifying in support of LD 1829, An Act to Reduce Prescription Drug Costs by 
Requiring Reference-based Pricing.  
 
My child has Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). A medication 
Corlanor (Ivabradine) was prescribed to reduce the heart rate by changing the heart’s 
electrical activity.  
 
The insurance company denied it and it was going to cost almost $600 for 60 pills at our 
local Walgreens. I started researching other ways to obtain the medication. I looked into 
using the RX discount card and researched online Canadian websites. Prescription 
costs in the US are astronomical and my adult child cannot afford to pay out of pocket 
for necessary medications. Please see the attached price table I created for 
Corlanor/Ivabradine comparison.  
 
I worked diligently with the doctor’s office and provided additional information showing 
other medications that did not work to finally have the prescription approved. This took 
months and a lot of time and effort. 
 
Thank you, 
Tracy Robertson
