Senator Barley, Representatlve Perry, and Members of the J o1nt Standrng Commrttee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Frnancral Servrces 
My name 1s Dan Dementt, the Executrve Drrector of the Mame Assoclatron of Health Plans 
(MeAHP) Our plans lnclude Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shleld, Crgna, CVS / Aetna, 
Communlty Health Optrons, Harvard P1lgr1m Health Care, and Unrted Health Care Our member 
health msurance earners provrde or adm1n1ster health msurance coverage to about 600,000 
Mame people Our m1ss1on as an assoc1at1on 1s to rmprove the health of Marne people by 
promotrng affordable, safe, a.nd coordrnated healthcare 
The excessrve cost of prescnptlon drugs 1s one of the key contrrbutors to mﬂatron 1n health care 
and one of the blggest challenges msurance carrrers face when trylng to keep premrums 
affordable We understand the ob] ect1ve of LDs 1816 and 1829, and our assoc1at1on supports 
efforts to control the rlsrng costs of prescrrptron drugs 
We oppose penalrzrng earners for the mrsconduct of drug manufacturers not makrng prescrlptlon 
drugs on the target l1st avarlable 1n Marne at reference-based prrces 
The Marne Health Data Organrzatron reports annually on prescrrptron drug costs and ut1l1zat1on 
1n Ma1ne at retarl and marl-order pharmacres The report for the year endrng June 30, 2022, tells 
us that prescrrptron drug spendrng rncreased by 6 6% desplte a 1 8% decrease 1n the number of 
prescrrptrons ﬁlled 
The $2 762 b1ll1on We spent on prescrrptrons last year amounts to $2,000 for every Marner1 
The ob]ect1ve of LDs 1816 and 1829 1s to achleve parrty between the costs pald for some 
prescrrptron drugs by consumers Wrth prrvate msurance and those protected by Med1care ’s new

Our concern w1th L D s 1816 and 1829 1s that both bllls seek to punlsh health msurance plans for 
the actlons of drug manufacturers These b1l1s place the burden and the punrshment on carrlers 
for payrng more than the reference prrce wrthout restrlctmg the ab1l1ty of a drug manufacturer to 
charge more than the reference pnce If the legrslature 1s rnterested 1n regulatmg the pnce of 
prescr1pt10n drugs, 1t should regulate the amount charged, not the amount pald, and punlsh drug 
manufacturers that charge more than that amount
