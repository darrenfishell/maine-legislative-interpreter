Jolnt Standlng Comm|ttee on Jud|c|ary 
Testlmony of Malne Transgender Network 
LD 535 "An Act to Increase Access to Necessary Medlcal Care for Certaln Mlnors" 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and honorable members of the Jud|c|ary Comm|ttee my 
name ls Qulnn Gormley, I am the Executlve Dlrector of MalneTransNet, and I am testlfylng today ln 
enthuslastlc support of LD 535 "An Act to Increase Access to Necessary Medlcal Care for 
Certaln Mlnors" 
All thlngs cons|dered, I got pretty lucky wlth my parents They are lncredlbly acceptlng and 
supportlve of both me and my slbllng as transgender people My dad IS my blggest cheerleader 
My mom ls my best frlend The happlness and closeness my famlly knows ls rare And lt ls also 
recent When I flrst came out to my parents when I was 14, they were worrled and confused, but 
they trled They took me to theraplsts and doctors They got me evaluated, tested, dlagnosed 
Every provlder came to the same concluslon "Pam, Mal, you have a daughter, and she needs 
help" 
But when that help looked llke hormones, my parents hesltated It's not that they dldn't understand 
I was trans It's not that they rejected me But they were scared about, what lf I changed my mlnd, 
what would havlng klds look llke, what would my Ilfe look llke‘? Because of that fear, they dragged 
thelr feet for two years In that tlme, I grew four lnches My faclal halr started comlng ln My 
shoulders got wlder, my chln grew boxler, my volce dropped I learned how to cut myself, and what 
the lnslde of a psychlatrlc ward looks llke 
My parents weren't wrong to have fears Fear and anxlety about our klds golng through blg 
changes ls understandable But my parents falled to understand that maklng me walt wasn'ta 
neutral actlon thelr chooslng not to act had consequences for me And desplte how posltlve our 
relatlonshlps have become, I contlnue to llve wlth the consequences of thelr fear 
Gettlng to the polnt where a provlder recommends a young trans person begln hormones ls not 
easy It requlres multlple lnteractlons wlth mental health provlders to explore the person's ldentlty ‘ 
It lnvolves exploratlon of what soclal and medlcal lnterventlons would relleve the stress of gender 
dysphorla — the medlcal term for the feellng of mlsallgnment between sex and gender felt by many 
transgender people And before medlcal lnterventlons are approved, lt lnvolves ln depth

WPATH Standards of Care Verslon 8
d|scuss|ons about the long term ram|f|cat|ons of that care on the development of the|r bodles and 
the|r reproductrve capab|l|t|es 
Because transgender healthcare |s hrghly stlgmatlzed, youth don‘t always get the care they 
need The same rs true for other health care needs as well Abortlon, for example, IS often 
deeply strgmatized, yet our state recognlzes that denynng young people access to abortron care 
may be harmful to them, and a v|olat|on of the|r bod||y autonomy So too w|th transgender health 
care No one should be denled medncally necessary care because the care rs mlsunderstood 
and strgmatrzed No one should be dented medlcally necessary care because of the famlly they 
were born lI'l'[O 
Broad lT1€C|lC8|' 
consensus recognlzes that gender transltlon care |s the standard of care |n 
approprlate c|rcumstances followmg careful evaluatlon Makmg an adolescent wa|t unt|l age 18 
to get the care they need IS harmful Evrdence shows that mmors who have been dragnosed 
w|th gender dy' sphor|a have more successful treatment and better l|fe outcomes when they 
recelve tlmely care and are thus able to go through puberty congruent wlth the|r gender |dent|ty 
Makmg them wart to recelve care IS dangerous 
We have ample precedent recognlzmg the capac|ty of 16 and 17 year olds to provrde Informed 
consent to a w|de variety of healthcare procedures, especlally when such procedures are 
stlgmatlzed, or vvhere the consequences of |nact|on result In llfelong consequences 
I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 535
