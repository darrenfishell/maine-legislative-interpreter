Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Judiciary, my name IS Joe Anderson l am a resident of Portland, a 
pediatrician in Lewiston, and l serve on the board of the Maine Chapter of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics I am writing today to express our support for 
LD 535 An Act to Increase Access to Necessary Medical Care for Certain Minors 
We ask that you vote Ought to Pass on this bill. 
As we have discussed with other proposed legislation recently, confidentiality and 
independent consent for potentially sensitive health care issues are important 
components of adolescent health care 1 
This is especially important for LGBTQ 
adolescents, as fewer than 40% of LGBTQ young people live in LGBTQ-affirming 
homes 2 Research increasingly suggests that familial acceptance or l‘8]eC‘lZlOl'1 
ultimately has little influence on the gender identity of youth, however, it may 
profoundly affect young person's ability to openly discuss or disclose concerns 
about their identity, and ultimately their mental health A study of 433 
adolescents in Ontario who identified as trans revealed suicide attempt rates of 
4% among those with strongly supportive parents, and as high as 60% among 
those whose parents were not supportive3 
Pediatricians strive to create a safe environment for parents and families to better 
understand and listen to the needs of their children while receiving reassurance 
and education We try to help adolescents understand their parents’ concerns as 
well The process of acceptance and understanding can be challenging and 
complex for families, and unfortunately parental acceptance isn't always attained 
by adolescence, if at all For youth experiencing gender dysphoria, this can make 
the teenage years particularly troublesome, as they enter puberty and develop 
secondary sex characteristics of their sex assigned at birth 
Gender dysphoria is a well-recognized medical diagnosis with an established and 
effective treatment One aspect of treatment is social affirmation, the other is 
gender-affirming hormone therapy Gender affirming hormone therapy allows 
adolescents to develop secondary sex characteristics of the opposite biological 
sex This therapy can be life saving in the case of young adults struggling with 
gender dysphoria 
Late adolescence IS a pivotal time in the lives of all teens For those suffering from 
gender dysphoria, it can be either liberating or suffocating For those who have 
access to gender affirming care, they can look forward to finishing high school and 
moving forward to their next stage of life, be it higher education or the workforce, 
presenting themselves to the world in a manner that they feel matches who they 
are inside For those who have been denied access to gender affirming care, 
taking that next step can be incredibly distressing The thought of entering a new 
environment and meeting a new peer group while still physically presenting ina 
way that is incongruent with their internalized gender can be paralyzing

Allowing adolescents to make decisions about their own gender affirming care 
recognizes their autonomy and right to self-determination It respects their 
personal experiences, feelings, and understanding of their own gender identity It 
empowers young people to take ownership of their bodies and healthcare 
decisions, promoting a sense of agency and well-being 
In Maine, laws and medical guidelines already permit adolescents to consent to 
certain medical treatments without parental consent These laws were developed 
based on extensive research, ethical considerations, and expert opinion, aiming to 
balance the best interests of the adolescent with their safety and well-being 
Treatment for gender dysphoria is time-sensitive, and delaying access to gender 
affirming care can have negative consequences Allowing adolescents to 
independently consent to gender affirming care reduces potential barriers to 
accessing timely interventions, ensuring that they receive the care they need 
when they need it, which can lead to better long-term outcomes 
We believe this amended bill is thoughtful, the level of counseling and education 
required of the adolescent IS incredibly thorough Ultimately, this bill is designed 
to prioritize what is in the best interests of the adolescent It ensures they are 
fully informed on the consequences, benefits, and alternatives to gender affirming 
hormone therapy before allowing them to consent, and ensures they are able to 
access this medically necessary care We urge you to support the health of this 
underserved population and vote Ought to Pass on LD 535. 
Respectfully,
