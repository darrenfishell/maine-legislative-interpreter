Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representatrve Moone, and members of the Judrcrary 
Commrttee My name 1s Rory Tmnbull, my pronouns are they/them/therrs, and I am from Standrsh I am 
m ﬁrll support of LD 535 
I am l6 years old, and I am Transgender, Norrbmary I have been out and socrally transrtroned for 
two years now I love to wrrte musrc, smg m my hrgh school, select chorr, act, draw, among other thmgs 
And Mame 1s my home The word “home” means much more than some people thrnk To me Mame rsa 
place where I can be safe, happy, loved, and supported by my commumty But 1t strll has much room for 
growth and lmprovement I want to help make that growth happen Before my transrtron, I was m mrddle 
school Way before then, I had never truly felt hke my assrgned gender at bnth I d1dn’t know I had any 
other optrons, but somethrng always felt wrong I was rarsed pretty rehgrously I had no 1dea what 
transgender even meant 
In mrddle school, I started puberty I felt hornble The small amount of strange I felt before 
erupted mto thrs overwhelmmg feelmg of utter self hatred I hated my body, and I d1dn’t know whyI 
started leammg what trans nonbmary meant, and rt felt rrght But I d1dn't feel hke I could change anythmg 
yet I d1dn’t feel okay wrth bemg trans, because of how httle everyone around me knew Thrs feelmg, I 
now know 1s gender dysphorra, became so overwhelmmg I felt trapped m my own body, and I felt hke 
there was no way out I d1dn’t want to deal wrth that temble feelmg anymore, whrch got so bad that 
sometlmes I could feel physrcal pam m my chest, and breathrng was hard Lrvmg seemed more hkea 
burden than a Joy, and I d1dn’t want to hve anymore If I had known that healthcare, and gender afﬁrmmg 
0pt10IlS were an optron, I may not have felt so alone Soon I had gathered up the courage to come out to 
my mom and my dad My mom showed her full support, buymg me chest bmders, and helpmg me go get 
my harrcut m a way that made a lot of ﬂrat werght and pam go away The ﬁrst trme I put my chest bmder 
on, I cned I erred and laughed w1th_|oy, I ﬁnally felt rrght 1n how I looked, and I ran downstarrs to my 
mom and srsters and I was so exerted, and they were happy for me too 
The next year thmgs would only get better I would meet a bunch of new people who support and 
love me to thrs day, and help me realrze what “home” means Home 1sn’t a house Home 1sn’t a place 
Home rs a commumty, ﬁ1ll of people who love and support you, and hsten to you I had ﬁnally found that 
But there are others who aren't as lucky as I am I am pnvrleged 1n the way that because of my supportrve 
famrly, that 1f I chose to I would have access to gender aﬂirmmg care, such as gender therapy, hormones, 
etc But there are many others that I know who don’t have that pnvrlege, who go home not to a home, but 
to a house A house wrth people who won’t lrsten to them, and the effects are rrreversrble There are many 
hke me who never saw that optron for care, or could see rt but couldn’t attam rt And because of that, they 
are gone 
To me, Marne 1s home Marne rs a place where I can be myself, and where I can be hstened to, 
and celebrated, and loved I have seen the eﬁects of thrs mrracle of healthcare on ﬁrends, and 1t brmgs 
people together, saves lrves, and brmgs Joy You all m front of me have the power to make Mame home, 
for all of us, to save hves, and to brrng people together If we don’t pass th1s b111, we would be takmg 
away home ﬁom those who need rt most Look mto my eyes, see me, and lrsten Pass thrs b1ll Make 
Mame home, for all ofus
