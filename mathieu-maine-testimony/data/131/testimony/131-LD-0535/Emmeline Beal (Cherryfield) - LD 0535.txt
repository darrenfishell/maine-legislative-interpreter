Testimony of Emmeline Beal 
Against LD 535 
An Act to Increase Access to Necessary Medical Care for Certain Minors 
and LD 1735 
An Act to Safeguard Gender-affirming Health Care 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on the 
Judiciary, 
My name is Emmeline Beal of Cherryfield, and I am testifying in opposition to LD 535 and 
LD 1735 because I believe they displease the Creator and endanger children and families 
In 1620, ]USt over four hundred yearsi ago, the Pilgrims came to New England But why? 
What compelled them to leave everything they had known and start over in a new land? 
Actually, they did it twice. In 1607 and 1608 they fled England because of religious 
persecution They moved to the Netherlands, where they could serve God freely according to 
their conscience, guided by the Bible Over time, however, it became clear that living there was 
not a permanent solution. In his book Of Plymouth Plantation, Governor William Bradford 
wrote an eyewitness account of their experiences, including the reasons they left the 
Netherlands 
I would like to share with you one of his reasons "But still more lamentable, and of all 
sorrows most heavy to be borne, was that many of the children, influenced by these conditions 
[of economic hardship], and the great licentiousness of the young people of the country, and 
the many temptations of the city, were led by evil example into dangerous courses, getting the 
reins off their necks and leaving their parents. Some became soldiers, others embarked upon 
voyages by sea and others upon worse courses tending to dissoluteness and the danger of their 
souls, to the great grief of the parents and the dishonour of God So they saw their posterity 
would be in danger to degenerate and become corrupt"1 
Due to this and several other causes, the Pilgrims prepared to set out for the New World 
During their sixty-six-day crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, they endured cramped quarters, 
seasickness, mockery from the sailors, and lack of fresh water Their first winter in Plymouth 
was one of hunger, rampant illness, and painful loss, approximately half of them died Yet 
those left behind persevered for the sake of their Lord and for the sake of posterity l wonder, if 
William Bradford were alive today and knew that these bills were being proposed in the very 
New England he and his fellow Pilgrims sacrificed to build, what would he say?
