LD 535 
My name 1s N1cholas Sevos, and I am a resldent of Searsport When I went to look up 
th1s b11l, there was only a short summary stat1ng 1t would be for the purpose of" 
mcrease access to necessary med1cal care for ce1ta1n m1nors" Th1s sounds hkea 
general1zat1on of allowmg chlldren to rece1ve hormonal theraples, surg1cal alteratlons, 
etc 1n the name of pushmg a transgender 1dent1ty on them I say pushmg because a 
chtld who 1s transgender 1s 11ke a cat who wears a sweater, you can say they chose 1t 
all you want but we all know someone else made the dec1s1on STOP SUPPORTING THIS MADNESS A grown adult has the nght to do what they Want, even 1f We all 
choose (and should choose) to go along w1th 1t, but a ch11d has no ab1l1ty make such 
cho1ces, to understand the full grav1ty of these Cl101C6S and consequences of them 
Every effort must be made to protect chlldren from these lunatlcs, and 1t starts by not 
codlfymg even more allowances for th1s ev1l 1nto law
