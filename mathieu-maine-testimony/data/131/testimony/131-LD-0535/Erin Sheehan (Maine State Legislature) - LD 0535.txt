Testimony of Representative Erin Sheehan introducing 
LD 535 - An Act to Increase Access to Necessary Medical Care for Certain Minors 
before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
April 26, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and esteemed colleagues of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Erin Sheehan and l represent part of the 
great City of Biddeford Today, I present to you LD 535, “An Act to Increase Access to 
Necessary Medical Care for Certain Minors" 
The goal of this proposal is to protect the lives of young trans people who will 
certainly be harmed by a delay in receiving gender-af ﬁrming care, including gender- 
afﬁrming hormone therapy, which includes interventions to suppress puberty, to align 
the pat|ent’s appearance with their gender identity, and to alleviate the effects of gender 
dysphoria Not all trans people experience gender dysphoria, but those who do 
experience significant psychological distress due to the mcongruence between their sex 
characteristics and their gender identity Parents of trans youth may deny their children 
access to care for a variety of reasons on the basis of deeply held beliefs, for example, 
or because they want to protect their children from possible adverse consequences 
There are, however, grave risks associated with delaying or denying gender-affirming 
care, especially gender-af ﬁrming hormone therapy, to young people experiencing 
gender dysphoria ln these cases, delaying or denying care results in negative long- 
term consequences, including intensifying dysphoria due to the physical effects of 
Distnct 132 Blddetord (part)
puberty, greatly elevated risk of self-harm, and in the need for further, more invasive 
medical inten/entions later in life The testimony following my presentation will provide 
you with medical, legal, and personal insights regarding the risks and consequences of 
delayed care 
LD 535 creates a pathway for 16 and 17 year old transgender Mainers to access 
gender-af ﬁrming hormone therapy without parental consent if, and only if, a health care 
professional, defined in 1 (C), determines that the minor meets strict requirements, and, 
that after extensive counseling and information provision, the minor is mentally and 
physically competent to understand the information provided and to give informed 
consent for this kind of care 
Before providing care to such a minor, a health care professional must establish 
that the minor meets the following thresholds 
1) the minor has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria 
2) the minor is experiencing or will experience harm if the care is not provided 
3) the health care professional has determined the minor mentally and physically 
capable to consent and has secured from that minor informed written consent 
To be clear, under the provisions of this bill, health care providers retain 
signiﬁcant discretion If, in their opinion, a minor will not experience harm if care not 
provided, or if they do not believe a minor mentally or physically capable to consent, 
they may decline to sign off on care This provision does not oblige providers to endorse 
or provide gender-affirming hormone therapy 
To ensure that consent for gender-affirming hormone therapy is informed 
consent, a health care professional must provide extensive information and counseling, 
which must include the following to be documented in writing 
D1stnct 132 B1ddeford (part)
- lnformatIon on gender afﬁrmIng hormone therapy, Its possIble consequences and 
benefIts, and alternatrves to gender afﬁrmmg hormone therapy, and how to access 
further relIable InformatIon on the toprc, 
- An explanatIon that the mInor may wIthdraw a decIsIon on to proceed wIth receIvIng 
gender-af ﬁrmmg hormone therapy, 
- A clear and full exploratron of the alternatIves for managIng the gender dysphorra, 
- Ample opportunIty for the mInor to ask questrons and receIve answers about gender- 
afﬁrmmg hormone therapy, 
- A conversatron about the possIbIlIty of InvolvIng the mInor’s parent or guardIan In the 
mInor’s decIsIon makmg about gender-af ﬁrmIng hormone therapy, along wlth an 
explanatlon of the reasons for not InvolvIng theIr parents or guardIan 
Later testlmony wIll provlde a more robust prcture of what thIs looks lIke In 
pract|ce, but thIs portlon of the bIll puts In statute sIgnIﬁcant provIsIons to ensure that 
mInors seekmg thIs care are Informed and not coerced Into InItIatIng care Should the 
process result In wrItten Informed consent, the health care professIonal who provIded 
the InformatIon and counselIng must slgn, date, and address the form, and retaIn It In 
theIr records 
ln closIng, I'd lIke to thank my commIttee colleagues for your attentlon and your 
engagement The Issues we’re consIderIng here are hlghly sensItIve at the best of 
tImes, but today, transgender health care Is beIng polItIcIzed and stIgmatIzed In the 
press and on socIal medIa Transgender people, IncludIng youth, are beIng explIcItly 
vIlIﬁed and branded a threat to theIr peers by grown-ups, even by leaders In theIr 
communItIes ThIs promotes fear and suspIcIon across the entIre spectrum of opInIon, 
makmg It dIfﬁcult for us to undertake the conscIentIous delIberatIons we owe our 
constltuents lwant you to know that l am commItted to that process But the fear and 
suspIcIon also does a great dIsservIce to youth— and to parents, the vast maIorIty of 
whom want what Is best for theIr chlld and want access to trustworthy Informatlon on 
how to facIlItate the best for them Thank you for keepIng the best Interests of our most 
vulnerable youth In mInd as you delIberate As you all know, l’m not a doctor, a lawyer, a
