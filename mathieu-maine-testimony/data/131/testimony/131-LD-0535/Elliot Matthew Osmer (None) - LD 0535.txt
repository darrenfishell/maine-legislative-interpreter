Hello Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonln and members of the Judlclal Commltee My 
name IS Elllot Matthew Osmer and I am 16 years old Although that's not the name on my blrth 
cemflcate that IS slmply who I am I'm here to speak about passlng the b|ll to allow trans youth 
ages 16-17 to start hormone replacement therapy wlthout parental consent Growlng upI 
always felt as If I was out of place and In a body that was not my own It felt as If my body d|dn't 
match who I was or who I was supposed to be I knew Il'I order to contmue my journey I had to 
take my own steps to do thls At age twelve I came out to my mother as transgender, andI 
remember to thls day how terrlfled I was to tell her As the years passed, cuttmg my halr and 
changmg my clothes were no longer enough, and I knew that to truly feel llke myself I would 
need to start HRT In order to do thus I would have to come out to my father as well In my caseI 
was met wlth support and understandmg After a year of waltlng I ﬁnally was able to start 
Testosterone In that year of waltlng It gave me something to look fon/vard to and kept me gomg 
everyday I could tell myself "okay I can do thls, I'm gomg to be startlng soon” I w|ll always 
remember the rellef I felt once I started I could ﬁnally be myself But unfortunately thls |sn’t the 
case for many trans youth today They are faced wlth parents who don't support them, and have 
no escape from the cycle of feellng out of place HRT truly saved my Ilfe and allowed me to be 
able to become the person I am andz always was on the Inslde Nearly three quarters of trans 
I a 
students reported depresslve symptoms and half of them serlously consldered sulclde In the 
past year |ust In Mame alone I'm asklng you to pass thls b|ll In hopes th/at no more trans klds, 
who may have not been met wlth the same support that I was, w|II no longer become part of the 
r|s|ng statlstlc of sulclde among trans youth Thank you foryeu-F llstenlng
