HelpIng transgender youth to get the gender-affIrmIng care they so desperately 
need can help that dream become a realIty SomethIng to look fonrvard to and 
achIevIng comfort and safety In your own body, especIally In the hardest years of

g0Ing to say the names of ones I have lost to the battle agamst themselves
