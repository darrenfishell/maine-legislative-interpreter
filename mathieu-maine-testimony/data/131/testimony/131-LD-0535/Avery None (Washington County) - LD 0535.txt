Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and honorable members of the Judicial committee, 
good afternoon, my name's Avery, I use he/him pronouns, I'm from Washington County, and I'm 
testifying in support of LD 535 “An Act to Increase Access to Necessary Medical Care for 
Certain Minors" 
I keep thinking about a time where I was on a date with my partner A student from my school 
saw us together and reacted quiet strongly to us being together This student had a history of 
calling me derogatory terms on school grounds This student looks over and uses a multitude of 
slurs and belittling comments This student also has a history of getting violent and he is much 
bigger than both my partner and I He looked like he was going to turn around and come 
towards us We scrambled and ran in the other direction Our date was ruined out of fear for our 
lives 
This fear lives inside of me every day Following this incident, I continued my search for options 
that I could access to look more like my male peers There was nothing anyone could do without 
a signature from a guardian Just a simple signature I feared for my safety in my school, I 
feared for the safety of my partner Where I come from if you appear trans or 
gender-nonconforming you are unsafe Unfortunately, I'm visibly trans I don't look like a typical 
teenage boy My facial features are too soft, my voice too high, and my body far too 
feminine Knowing this, I don't feel at home with my body Not only does this affect me 
safety-wise, but it also affects my mental health and school life on a daily basis It's hard to 
make friends when everyone seems to think you're some sort of imposter because of your 
identity I cannot thrive in a society that sees me as less than 
If this bill was to pass, I could avoid future altercations like the one mentioned before This bill 
would allow 16 year and up access to this life-saving care and in less than 2 weeks, I will be 16I 
started puberty at 8 years old I may not be able to reverse the effects of the hormones that 
have coursed throughout my body for the last 8 years, but I might be able to salvage what little 
bit of time I have left by ﬁtting in with my peers Because the truth IS, I don't ﬁt in I get weird 
stares, rude comments, and I have no friends And because of this, I have been further isolated 
by a community that wasn't built for me, just as many trans youth have 
The most common argument you might see against gender-affirming care to minors IS maturity 
It's easy to assume that people like myself are not mature enough to make a C|8ClSl0I'I that'lI 
drastically change their lives But I disagree In the fall of last year, I went to my school board 
and advocated for myself to graduate a year early, and I was approved Not only did I do that, but 
in that same time frame I received my driving permit That fall I also applied for different college 
classes, all of which I was accepted into My achievements aren't unique, either Transgender 
teens who operate without the support of their parents are mature due to their need tobe
\ 
self-suf ﬁcient We mature faster because we have to And in the case where a transgender 
teenager ISN'T mature enough, they would not qualify under this bill's requirements 
The emotional rewards of transitioning are indescribable The ﬁrst time I saw my chest ﬂat,I 
cried out of relief and joy The ﬁrst time I cut my hair short l was so giddy and had a smile on my 
face for the rest of the day The ﬁrst piece of men's clothing I owned is so cherished that there's 
a rip in the shirt because of how much I wore it I've saved every hall pass from my teachers that 
have my chosen name on it I kept the ﬁrst medical documentation of a doctor recognizing that 
I'm trans Trans joy can be incredible if you have the care you need 
Unfortunately, most transgender youths do not receive the care that we need to thrive 
According to the National Library of Medicine Right now, in the United States, there are upward 
of 130,000 transgender teenagers 56% of these youths have reported a suicide attempt and 
82% reported feeling suicidal This study factored in what was causing the high rates of 
suicidality The most signiﬁcant contributions were school belonging, emotional neglect by 
family, and internalized self—stigma Gender-af ﬁrming care would solve most, if not all of these 
issues therefore dropping suicide rates If this passes, It WILL save lives 
For many people, gender is an afterthought It's not a thing that most people consider or even 
notice But for trans people, every day is a ﬁght to ﬁt in and be accepted by those around usI 
can't change people's minds about me, that's not my j0b l can't make school a safe spot when 
no one will listen to me, the only thing I can do is advocate for change If this bill passes I will be 
able to get life-saving medication that would help me be seen as who I am You have the power 
to change my world Therefore I'm asking you to please consider voting to pass LD 535 
Thank you so much for listening to my testimony and I hope it has helped you to understand 
our perspective
