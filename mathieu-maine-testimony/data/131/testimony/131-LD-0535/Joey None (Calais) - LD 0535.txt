Good afternoon members of the JudIcIary CommIttee, my name Is Joey, I use he/hIm pronouns, 
and I am 17 years old I am a senlor at Calals HIgh School I am testIfyIng In support of LD 535 
An Act to Provlde Necessary MedIcaI Care to CertaIn MInors 
Two thlngs I can tell you rIght now about beIng a teenager are that parental conﬂIcts are bound 
to happen, and that you do not maglcally become mature on your 18th blrthday I can also tell 
you that If famIly conf|Icts happen as a result of havlng to waIt untII age 18 to access IIfe savrng 
care, parental relatlonshrps wIlI be conslderably damaged compared to what they have 
the potential to be 
Gender-af ﬁrmmg care Is somethIng everyone who needs It should have Unfortunately, many do 
not As of recently, I ImagIne we have all seen a lot of conversatrons happen In other states 
about how monumental numbers of kIds wIlI dre by suIcIde If they don’t get the IIfe-savlng care 
they need, when they need It - especially If they have to wart untIl age 18 So, what about those 
who do have to waIt untII age 18 because theIr parents won’t slgn for It’? 
When parents are the only thlng standIng In the way of lIfe-savIng care, It wrll put a straIn on the 
relatlonshlp TransItIonIng Is not always an easy process for everyone and theIr famIIIes But If 
parents need tIme to process, that tIme Is bemg stolen from the mInor who Is suffenng 
I am one such example, and my experlences echo those who have also had to waIt whIle the 
tIme to receIve gender-af ﬁrmmg care quIckly tIcks by 
I've known I was transgender srnce before the pandemrc I've known I was transgender srnce 
before I started hIgh school In 2019 I have the support of every medrcal provIder I have metI 
have had the dlagnosrs of gender dysphorla for 3 years Staff at school have seen me cry over 
not bemg able to access medlcal treatment, day after day after day 
In that tIme my bones have cemented me Into a ﬁgure that Is not mIne, and all I see In the mIrror 
Is a shell of lost potentIaI I have a sIIm chance of gettIng taller, and my hIp bones wIII never be 
as narrow as they once were Gender dysphorra Is degeneratIve when you are a mmor because 
It typIcally gets worse as puberty progresses As It goes, the longer you waIt for treatment, the 
more Invasrve and expensIve It wIIl be later on 
I have spent the last 4 years In and out of doctor's ofﬁces trylng to ﬁnd someone, anyone who 
could help me, and all I have gotten Is “Oh, that sucks, but It's okay, because you only have5 
more years left untII you can do what you want” 
or “Ugh, I’m so sorry I really don’t know what we can do wrthout a slgnature but you only have 
4 more years untrl you can srgn for yourselfI" 
or “I know It’s hard and we’ve had thls conversatlon before, but hang In there You only have3 
more years ” “Just try to stlck It out You only have 2 years left ” “1 more year" 
Every bIrthday has been a celebratlon of the tIme trIckIIng away before the date of autonomy 
The age of 18 should be a mllestone - not a countdown Some people don't have a few years 
left In them - I know I clIdn't
“Wr 
I thmk It hurts the most when people who come out and socrally transrtron after me, especrally rf 
they are younger, access thls care before I do 
I've been employed srnce the age of 15 I pay Income taxes l’II be attending college this yearI 
am plannrng on gettmg Ircensed very soon after havrng a permrt for a year and a half I am the 
valedrctorran of my class Teens have the capabrlrty of bemg mature too 
It rs ngj; farr that I have every other qualrfrcatlon that would make me ehglble for thrs 
treatment, but |t IS bemg held above my head ]US|Z because I d|dn’t get the luck of the 
draw 
I wall never heal from bemg forced to wart longer than I had to I feel as though my mabrhty to 
access thus care. even hormone blockers, has taken the potential to be a happier, healthrer 
person away from me 
Thank you for your trme and consrderatlon, and I hope you vote ought to pass on LD 535
