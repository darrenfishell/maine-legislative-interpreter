LD 1222
My name is Scott Beal. I am the Environmental & Security Manager for Woodland 
Pulp in Baileyville. On behalf of the 480 Women and Men at our three member 
companies (Woodland Pulp LLC, St. Croix Tissue, Inc. and St. Croix Chipping). I 
wanted to I offer my testimony in Support of LD-1222 in the form of this email as I’m
unable to attend today’s Public Hearing or participate remotely.
The age demographics at our facilities are similar to countless others in our state.  
Over the past several years, we have experienced a large turnover in our employee 
base largely due to well earned retirements. As we work to replace retiring employees
with some younger individuals looking to start their careers (and families), our HR 
department hears all too often the difficulties younger workers face with the dearth of 
available Child Care services.  Unfortunately this serves as a barrier for some to enter 
the state’s workforce and has an impact on our ability to recruit and retain younger 
members of the state’s population segment. 
While this may not serve as the missing link to solving the current situation, we 
nevertheless believe this will be a very important step in helping to remedy it. 
As such, we very much appreciate Senator Stewart, Senator Bennett, Senator Vitelli, 
President Jackson, Representatives Millett and Terry for sponsoring and 
co-sponsoring this bill. In closing we are asking for your support in giving this bill a 
Unanimous Ought-To-Pass vote out of committee.
Thank you for considering our position on this legislation.
