Testimony of Meg Helming before 
the Committee On Taxation 
in support of 
LD 1222: An Act to Expand Child Care Services Through 
an Employer-Supported Tax Credit 
Apﬂl11,2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and distinguished members of the Committee On Taxation, my 
name is Meg Helming and I'm the COO for the YMCA Alliance of Northern New England, which represents 
the 15 YMCAs in Maine. The YMCA strongly supports LD 1222: An Act to Expand Child Care Sen/ices 
Through an Employer-Supported Tax Credit. 
Collectively, the 15 YMCAs in Maine are the largest childcare provider in the state. We serve thousands of 
children in our early childhood education programs, before/afterschool programs, and summer camp. 
These programs provide children with safe, nurturing and enriching care, and are a critical component of 
our state's infrastructure to support working parents and our economy. 
Unfortunately, the childcare system is under incredible strain. The Ys have extensive waitlists of families 
trying to access care for their children. The wait for an infant or toddler slot in particular can easily exceed 
a year. This leaves parents to make incredibly hard decisions around placing their children in unlicensed 
care, cutting back their work hours, or leaving the workforce altogether. Despite our best efforts, the 
system is failing Maine families. 
Even if families are able to secure a coveted childcare slot for their child, they are then faced with the 
challenge of paying for the care. I am acutely aware of this struggle as a parent of a 2.5 year old and7 
month old. My husband and I pay $566 per week for childcare — that is nearly $29,000 per year. My 
experience is not an anomaly. The average cost for childcare in Maine is $10,000 - $15,000 per child per 
year. To say that this puts an incredible strain on families is an understatement. 
LD 1222 presents a pathway for the State to help families, employers, and childcare providers work 
together in support of a common goal ~ increasing access to reliable and affordable care so parents can 
enter and remain in the workforce. As a childcare provider, we so appreciate the business community's 
recognition that addressing Maine's childcare challenges should not and cannot rest on the backs of 
parents or childcare providers alone. We all must work together. 
We urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 1222.
