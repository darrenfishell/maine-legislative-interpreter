207-324-5762  Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 1222 
An Act to Expand Child Care Services Through an 
Employer Supported Tax Credit  
 
April 11, 2023  
 
 
Senator Grohoski , Represent ative Perry, members of the Committee on 
Taxation, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director o f Maine Community 
Action Partner ship, and we support  LD 1222 An Act to Expand Child 
Care Services Through an Employer  Supported Tax Credit . 
 As we have all heard by now, Maine is in the middle of a few realities 
which, combined,  are hur ting our economy. All three are inextricably 
linked:  lack of affordable housing and childcare leads to people who 
cannot  find or keep the jobs  they need. This bill will help to a ddress one 
part of the problem  by incentivi zing employers to help their employees 
to access affordable childcare, so  they are able to join or  remain 
working.  
 
Maineâ€™s report on ending hunger by 2030 noted that lack of access to 
quality, affordable childcare is a barrier for heads of households and 
especiall y for women to participating in the workforce1. This tax 
incentive, combined with others this and other  committee s will hear this 
session, will cer tainly be a step in the right direction.  
 Thank you for your time and attention.
