RE: Testimony  in SUPPORT of LD 1222, An Act to  Expand Child Care Services Through an Employer -
supported Tax Credit  
 
Dear Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry and members of the Taxation  Committee:  
 
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO  of the Retail Association of Maine. I am a resident of 
Topsham.  We have more than  350 members statewide and represent retailers of all sizes. Maine’s retailers 
employ more than 85 ,000 Mainers. In the interest of time, I am also submitting comments on behalf of the 
Maine Gr ocers and Food P roducers Assoc iation. MGFPA is a business trade association representing more 
than 200 businesses within Maine’s food community; Main Street businesses including independently owned 
and operated grocery stores and supermarkets, food and beverage producers and processors, manufacturers, 
wholesalers, distributors, and supportive service companies. Both of our organizations are testif ying in  
support of LD 1222 . 
 
In 2020, Go vernor Mills appoin ted me to serve on the Economic Recovery Committee to help navigate Maine 
through the pandemic, and to provide direct ion to help grow Maine ’s economy. While our primary focus was 
helping businesses  that were directly harmed b y shutdowns and curtail ment of services, the Committee also 
spent time f ocusing on some of the underlying issues that were ha mpering Maine ’s econom y. Those two 
issue s are inex tricably tied together: wor kforce shortages, and lack of available childcare. There is a certain 
segm ent of the workforce that will be limited in their participation i f there is not aff ordable and available 
child care.

 While LD 1222 will not be a cure -all, it is certainly  a step in the right direction . The bill authorizes a refundable 
tax credit of up to $3,000 for an employer that pays or provides in -kind  resource s for child care for the 
children of its employees.  
 
We are pleased to see the bi -partisan sponsor ship of  this bill , and we believe it will be a positive step fo rward.  
We support LD 1222 , and hope the committee does as well.   
 
Sincerely,
