Steven Santiago
Orono
LD 1905
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and honorable members of the Joint Select 
Committee on Housing: my name is Steven Santiago, a UMaine student and resident 
of Orono testifying in favor of LD 1905.
Housing is not only a human need, but also a valuable asset. An asset that we the state
of Maine leave entirely exposed to markets. Markets however, are not the end all be 
all of organizing economies. They are fallible. A renal registry is a good practice to 
organize our economy and the data on housing in Maine. This is a good tool that will 
serve housing policy needs for decades to come. 
Without a single point of data organising, what housing is available is dependent on 
what platform you are using to search for housing. Not every rental is listed on 
Apartments.com or Craigslist. Some are exclusively posted to such places as 
facebook. Where I currently live was never posted to any such platform. Rather I 
heard of it through word of mouth. This is not a viable way to express rental 
information. 
Having to manage a truckload of separate apps and platforms is exhausting. You have
no assurances when engaging with the market. You don’t know whether your bid will 
even be acknowledged, lost in the sea of posting across various platforms. 
That’s what it is, a sea of information, subject to the same currents and tides as the 
Atlantic. People navigating this sea end up lost and confused. LD 1905 would provide
a port for safe harbour. LD 1905 will help Mainers, policy analysts or otherwise.
