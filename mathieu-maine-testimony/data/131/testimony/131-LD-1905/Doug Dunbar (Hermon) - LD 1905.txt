Testimony of Doug Dunbar from Hermon, Maine 
In Support of LD 1905 
An Act to Create a Residential Rental Unit Registry  
Public Hearing: May 19, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere and members of the Committee on Housing, my name is 
Doug Dunbar. I appreciate the opportunity to express support for LD 1905 and to thank 
Representative Amy Roeder for sponsoring this important bill. 
 
As legislators know, access to data is often essential for addressing and resolving problems in 
our communities and state. Currently, as everyone is aware, we are in the midst of a housing 
crisis. Even with meaningful interventions, it will be with us for years to come. LD 1905 would 
almost certainly help to address the crisis and benefit everyone interested in the housing market.  
 
Policymakers and community planners require data to make informed decisions about what is 
lacking and the actions to take in meeting our critical housing needs. LD 1905 would facilitate 
much greater access to necessary information. Likewise, housing navigators and others seeking 
to assist individuals and families obtain a place to call home would clearly benefit from having a 
place to turn for accurate, updated residential rental property details. 
 
But the benefits would not stop with people in desperate need of an apartment and those working 
to house them. Developers, real estate investors and landlords would gain from a clearer 
understanding of the housing stock. They would have much more reliable data to use in 
formulating business plans. In short, as previously indicated, everyone stands to benefit from LD 
1905. 
 
Thank you for giving this legislation serious consideration, especially in this time of crisis. The 
efforts of Representative Roeder and the billâ€™s cosponsors are appreciated.
