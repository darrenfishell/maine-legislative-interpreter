Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1905,
“An
Act
to
Create
a
Residential
Rental
Unit
Registry”
Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Housing,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1905
.
Maine
Policy
has
been
following
this
issue
on
the
local
level
in
Maine
since
Sanford
was
considering
its
own
rental
registry
in
June
2017.
We
pointed
to
the
potential
constitutional
issues
with
local
officials
pledging
to
go
“block-by-block”
and
“building-by-building”
to
administer
their
“proactive
inspections,”
seeking
“full
compliance”
with
a
new
city-wide
building
registry.

This
sort
of
Orwellian
language
should
make
any
American
nervous.
Unfortunately,
LD
1905
aims
to
bring
this
level
of
power
over
individuals
to
the
state
level,
enshrining
violations
of
constitutional
rights
into
state
law.
It
would
compel
landlords
to
register
their
rental
properties
and
allow
state
bureaucrats
to
inspect
rental
units
without
a
warrant,
and
fine
those
who
object.
Not
only
are
these
laws
at
odds
with
private
property
rights,
but
they
prevent
individuals
from
renting
their
property
without
being
subjected
to
a
coerced
inspection.
Mandatory
rental
inspections
violate
the
Fourth
Amendment
and
may
deter
property
owners
from
entering
the
housing
market
at
all.
Our
position
is
simply
this:
Mainers
should
not
lose
their
privacy
rights
just
because
they
choose
to
rent
a
property.
Enforcement
of
rental
registries
may
potentially
limit
Mainers’
4th
Amendment
rights
because
searches
pursuant
to
administrative
warrants
require
a
lower
standard
of
judicial
scrutiny,
under
current
interpretation.
This
is
wrong.
An
administrative
warrant
for
a
search
of
property
should
be
considered
like
any
other
warrant,
so
the
state
should
show
that
it
has
a
compelling
interest
to
subject
property
owners
to
inspection
of
their
rental
properties,
for
no
other
reason
than
it
exists.
In
the
context
of
Maine
law,
Title
30-A
§4452
gives
municipal
officials,
“with
the
consent
of
the
owner,
occupant
or
agent,”
authority
to
inspect
housing
property
for
code
violations.
It
does
not
allow
housing
inspections
to
be
carried
out
without
proper

consent,
as
the
U.S.
Constitution
mandates,
and
as
federal
district
courts
and
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
(SCOTUS)
have
maintained.
In
Payton
v
New
York
(1980)
,
SCOTUS
held
that
“the
sanctity
of
the
home
.
.
.
has
been
embedded
in
our
traditions
since
the
founding
of
the
Republic”
and
further,
in
Camara
v
San
Francisco
(1967)
,
that
“[i]t
is
surely
anomalous
to
say
that
the
individual
and
his
private
property
are
fully
protected
by
the
Fourth
Amendment
only
when
the
individual
is
suspected
of
criminal
behavior.”
In
Camara
,
the
Court
maintained
that
even
in
noncriminal
cases
(such
as
the
enforcement
of
building
codes)
the
Fourth
Amendment
still
applies.
In
2015,
Ohio’s
1851
Society
represented
property
owners
in
a
case
challenging
a
local
rental
registry
ordinance,
for
which
Judge
Susan
Dlott
of
the
Western
Division
of
the
Southern
District
of
Ohio
ruled
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
Fourth
Amendment
“insofar
as
it
authorizes
warrantless
administrative
inspections.”

A
paper
published
in
the
Touro
Law
Review
entitled,
“Administrative
inspections:
The
Loophole
in
the
Fourth
Amendment”
explores
the
relevant
case
law
and
constitutional
questions
in
greater
depth.

According
to
the
Fourth
Amendment,
no
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
shall
be
granted
without
obtaining
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause.
Probable
cause
refers
to
a
state
entity’s
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
or
will
soon
be
committed.
Barring
the
owner’s
consent,
government
officials
cannot
search
property
without
a
warrant.
Please
deem
LD
1905
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
reject
this
unnecessary
attempt
to
project
this
level
of
state
control
over
individual
property
ownership.
It
will
work
against
other
efforts
to
alleviate
the
state’s
housing
crisis.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
