 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Bangor, like many communities across the country, is facing challenges in providing affordable, quality housing. Housing impacts economic 
development, workforce recruitment and the health and wellbeing of residents. Providing housing that meets the needs of shifting demographics and 
new configurations of who lives in a household is even more difficult. Similar to other cities, areas of Bangor’s residential urban core are showing the 
signs of neglect after decades of investment, and development in the rural areas of the city and neighboring rural communities. Even so, Bangor has 
many assets in its housing market and provides a wonderful quality of life for many residents. Bangor is challenged, however, by an older housing 
stock, an older population, a lower median income, and a rating as the least affordable city to rent in Maine. Bangor is a service center that is host to 
many housing support programs including shelters and rental subsidies. The city has an active rental market with more than half of the city’s housing 
units serving as rentals, but it lacks data regarding the number, size, and quality of its rentals to ensure quality standards.  
To better understand these housing issues and develop recommendations for improvement, the City launched a work group to study housing. The 
findings of the work group’s analysis of Bangor’s housing situation, along with their recommendations and priority next steps, are included in this 
report. The work group was clear that decisive action is needed. The city’s resources and diverse community stakeholders will need to be activated to 
achieve sustained impact. 
Priority Recommendations for the City are to:  
1. Launch Rental Registry with Inspections 
2. Heightened Accountability for Housing Quality  
3. Incentivize Rehabilitation and Development in the Urban Core 
4. Develop a Housing Production Plan 
5. Update Zoning and Development Standards to Encourage Denser Development in the Urban Core 
 
Priority Recommendations for other stakeholders are to:  
1. Increase Supportive Housing Services 
2. Collaboratively Leverage Data Systems to Ease Access to Housing for Vulnerable Populations 
3. Utilize a Stakeholder Committee to Increase Community Engagement on Housing as an Economic Development Strategy 
Moving forward, Bangor needs to adopt a culture of “Yes” to housing similar to a citywide resident group in Massachusetts, A Better Cambridge. 
We are committed to building a more diverse and sustainable city, with housing for all people. We support increased 
housing of all kinds, smart, eco-friendly density, and growth that is public-transit centered, to create vibrant, 
walkable, bikeable, livable neighborhoods. Through education and advocacy, we seek to impact the public 
conversation, include under-represented groups, and encourage thoughtful, smart planning and policy . ~ A Better Cambridge

 BANGOR HOUSING: SITUATION OVERVIEW 
 
Bangor is in the midst of a housing crisis that has been brewing for decades. Quality, affordable housing is necessary for a city’s economic success and 
is a determinant of residents’ health and wellbeing. Bangor boasts award winning schools, a wide array of arts and cultural assets, diverse 
recreational opportunities, and thriving neighborhoods. Yet professionals such as nurses, lawyers and teachers, along with older adults and 
vulnerable populations, are all struggling to find housing in Bangor. There are 1,571 multi-unit properties in Bangor, but the City lacks data on how 
many rental units exist, what size they are, and the condition they are in. The City has also seen a spike in vacant properties that are a blight on 
neighborhood aesthetics and quality, while also removing housing units from inventory. In 2018, the City of Bangor launched a Housing Work Group 
and undertook a broad-based process to understand areas of concern regarding housing and to identify a set of recommendations to address these 
issues. 
 
National and local factors help tell the history behind the City’s challenges and the opportunity for solutions moving forward. Bangor’s rich history 
and success as the lumber capital of the world, or “Queen City” as it was referred to during the turn of the 20th Century, brought significant housing 
development in its urban core. These stately homes sometimes had 6 or 10 bedrooms to meet the needs of that era’s large household sizes. The 
residential urban core where this development focused is now described as the areas of Bangor inside Interstate 95 closest to downtown. These 
historic homes add appeal and character throughout the City, but they require ongoing maintenance and rehab to sustain their value and 
neighborhood aesthetic. This can be cost prohibitive in today’s market with changing demographics, particularly shrinking household size, aging 
residents, options in other communities and limited income. Today, Bangor’s housing stock is old compared to national standards, especially in its 
urban core, and these properties are frequently of lower quality due to lack of diligent maintenance and investment.  
 
Over time, national and local housing development and investment shifted away 
from single family properties in the urban core to suburban dwellings on larger 
lots on the outskirts of cities and in neighboring rural communities. These homes 
and developments are designed for vehicle transportation, not for pedestrians. 
This suburban style development meets a valuable sector of market demand that 
benefits communities. It even appears financially positive over the short-term 
from tax revenue. Research by Strong Towns has shown that over the long-term, 
however, this suburban style of development creates a shortfall for municipalities 
when considering the cost of developing and maintaining the new roads and 
infrastructure. The revenue created from these developments doesn’t cover the 
long-term costs. While housing growth throughout Bangor can help address the 
issues the city is facing, maximizing opportunities in the already dense urban core 
is essential. Using a “mini-village” lens of an area all within a 5-minute walk to 
public and pedestrian transit, and services like a market, coffee shop or school 
may highlight beneficial locations for residential development.    
“We need to intentionally return to our traditional 
pattern of development, one based on creating 
neighborhoods of value, scaled to actual people. 
When we do this, we will inevitably rediscover our 
traditional values of prudence and thrift as well as 
the value of community and place.”

Concurrent to the shift toward large lot sizes outside the urban core, national and local 
household sizes decreased. There has been a shift away from traditional households 
with two parents and children to smaller, single adult or multiple adults living in a 
household. These household changes don’t align with traditional development 
patterns of 4-bedroom single family homes for nuclear families. In fact, the American 
Association of Retired Persons 2018 report Making Room: Housing for a Changing 
America, found that “our vision of America’s household is inaccurate and outdated.” 
The same report also illustrated (graphic below) that the U.S. housing stock doesn’t 
align with current housing demand for single people living alone. Bangor Housing 
Authority shared their greatest demand for rentals is one-bedroom units. 
 
 
Decades ago, to address these household size shifts, Bangor’s 
large single-family historic homes in the urban core were 
transitioned to multi-unit rental properties. This is particularly 
evident in the West End, the East Side’s Tree Street neighborhood 
and along busier thoroughfares such as Center, Hammond and 
Ohio Streets. Many of these properties have not seen the level of 
investment required to maintain desirable neighborhood quality 
standards. Bangor Police and human service providers are also 
finding that areas with housing quality concerns are stressed from 
poverty and health and social issues such as drug overdoses, 
crime, and homelessness.  
 
 Case Study: Suburban Road 
A suburban road is in disrepair and needs to be resurfaced. The modest project involves repair of the existing paved surface and the installation of a 
new, bituminous surface. The total project cost was $354,000. We asked the question: Based on the taxes being paid by the property owners along 
this road, how long will it take for the city to recoup the cost of this project. The answer: 79 years, and only if the city adjusted upward its budget for 
capital improvements. For the city to recoup the cost of the repairs from the property owners in the development, an immediate property tax 
increase of 46% would be needed. Full case study at: StrongTowns.org, The Cost of Development, Local Roads Edition, January 2010   
 
“The post–World War II suburbanization of the United States  
was driven by the housing needs of nuclear families, a group 
 defined as two parents and their minor children. In 1950, 
these families represented 43 percent of households. Since 
then, unprecedented shifts in demographics and lifestyle have 
redefined who we are — and how we live. Today, nuclear 
families account for 20 percent of U.S. households.”

 Population and income also play a role in understanding the housing market. Census data shows that Bangor has had a stagnant population of about 
30,000 people since the loss of Dow Air Force Base in 1968. While Bangor has the highest percentage of 20-somethings in the region, Maine is also 
the oldest state in the nation and the percentage of older adults is expected to grow by 6% in the coming years. AARP data shows that while older 
adults may require some unique housing characteristics, they have similar needs for community assets as younger populations. Older adults’ needs 
for supports may also align well with flexible housing arrangements with younger demographics that need affordable housing.  
 
According to American Community Survey data, 
Bangor has had relatively stable wages since the 
2008 recession and has a comparatively low 
median annual income ($40,071 in 2017). The 
definition of affordability is set by Federal 
standards. To be affordable, no more than 30% 
of someone’s income should be spent on 
housing. The affordability index uses the median 
household or median renter income and the 
average 2-bedroom actual rent in the community 
(or ownership cost based on home prices). 
Anything less than 1 is considered unaffordable.  
 
Providing affordable housing is challenging when 
1 in 4 people in Bangor live below the Federal 
Poverty Line. Based on Maine State Housing 
Authority and Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages 
data, Bangor is less affordable for renters than all 
of Penobscot County, the State of Maine, and 
even larger cities such as Portland. It is similarly 
unaffordable for many residents to consider 
purchasing a home in Bangor. With multiple 
rental subsidy programs available to Bangor 
residents, the baseline for rent is set at a subsidy 
level that drives rates regardless of the quality of 
these units.

 Bangor’s affordability ranking compared to other communities is driven more by its lower median income, and the wages residents earn, than by the 
price of housing. In fact, compared to other Maine communities, the price of houses and rentals are generally lower in Bangor. See Tables 1 and 2 in the 
Data Summary section for more on the affordability index. This income differential may be explained by the age distribution of the city’s population.  
 
Bangor’s adult population has the highest numbers of 20 to 34-
year olds and potential retiree’s 65 years and older. These age 
groups at the beginning and end of their careers are frequently 
earning less than residents in the middle of their working 
career. These age groups also represent two of the three 
population growth areas in Bangor, while the city overall 
decreased in population between 2010 and 2017.  
 
According to the 2017 American Community Survey, 17% of 
adults under age 65 in Bangor were living with a disability 
compared to 12% in Maine and lower rates in towns 
surrounding Bangor. This may also impact the city’s median 
income. 
 
Young adults 25 to 34, as well as older adults, are more likely to 
need smaller housing units such as 1-bedrooms, rooms or 
efficiency units. This is reflected in the high demand for affordable, small units in Bangor. Bangor Housing Authority has waitlists and the highest 
demand for 1 bedrooms. More than 58% of Bangor’s state General Assistance program rental support went toward rooms, efficiencies and 1-
bedrooms. Data on the size of units in Bangor is for all housing units, not just rentals, but it leans toward larger units.

 Bangor continues to serve as the economic engine for the region. Just over 30,000 people live in Bangor, but more than 100,000 people travel into 
the area each day for work, services, shopping, and more. Bangor faces stiff competition for residential development in neighboring communities. 
These towns don’t face the same municipal burden of serving as the region’s service center and have comparatively lower property tax rates.  They 
also have more undeveloped land for new housing. Census data shows that neighboring towns have collectively had twice as much new housing 
development in the last few decades compared to Bangor.  This matters because newer housing stock is of higher quality and value. Maine’s 
population is also getting older. Census 2010 data estimates that b y 2030, 28% of Maine’s population will be 65 or older, higher than any other state 
and the national number is estimated at 20%. See Table 5 on page 24 for more detailed population data.

 The case needs to be made for the assets offered in Bangor to offset the costs of rehabbing older homes and building 
in denser areas, such as Bangor’s walkability, top quality neighborhood schools, access to the arts, services, and 
more. See Table 6 on page 25 for more housing unit data.

 Movement toward suburban development in combination with the 2008 recession that left many properties in foreclosure has left an increasingly 
large number of vacant/abandoned properties in most of Bangor’s historic neighborhoods. As a result, Bangor’s neighborhoods are blighted with 
properties that are in poor condition which, if not properly weatherized, will be irreparable after one or two winters. This is confounded by the 
national and local trend toward a decrease in average household size. This data may indicate that Bangor is experiencing national housing trends that 
show a misalignment between demand for smaller houses and the current stock of larger units.

 Bangor’s Housing Work Group listened closely to homeowners, city officials, landlords, service and health care providers, law enforcement, 
businesses, investors, and advocates for tenants during its seven meetings. The economic consequences of not addressing Bangor’s housing issues 
were paramount throughout the discussions. Also, of note, were the health issues that are a root cause of the struggles many populations face trying 
to find housing.  Significant community mental health and substance use challenges are driving the rate of homelessness and stretching emergency 
rooms and health care providers to their limits. The Housing Work Group clearly understood that a diverse stakeholder approach to solving the city’s 
housing concerns is necessary in order to positively impact all the factors involved.  The 25+ person Housing Work Group concluded with a prioritized 
set of recommendations. A smaller subset of participants then developed a short-term implementation plan for priority recommendations. These are 
included in this report. Two key messages the Housing Work Group clearly heard during its sessions were:  
 
Housing Quality Concerns: Bangor’s housing market, particularly for rentals, has serious issues resulting in poor condition and quality of too many 
properties. Some of these properties are now unsafe. There are also serious issues of unaffordability. Rental subsidy programs are available in Bangor 
and help many vulnerable populations find necessary housing, but this assistance is likely driving the market’s baseline and is supporting housing that 
doesn’t meet code.  Over time, the proliferation of dilapidated structures chopped into multiple apartments - a consequence of the availability, at 
reasonable prices, of Bangor’s stock of aging, large homes - has had serious negative consequences for those seeking safe, structurally sound housing, 
and also for the quality of neighborhoods. Meanwhile, there is a lack of quality workforce housing to attract young professionals and essential 
employees like teachers, police officers, and fire fighters. These problems have been cumulative, over decades, and have created an environment in 
some areas that don’t reflect Bangor’s values of quality of life and livable housing in desirable neighborhoods.  
 
Quick Action Is Needed:  Assertive action by a variety of stakeholders is required to confront the issues of quality, availability, safety, and affordability 
of single family and rental housing.  First, the City Council and city administration needs to address critical elements. These include registering and 
inspecting rental units, incentivizing rehab and development in the urban core, and revising development standards to allow for this denser 
development that leverages the City’s walkability, public transportation, neighborhood schools, and proximity to services. The City’s initiative and 
leadership will announce and serve as a catalyst to stakeholders that this community is committed to improving its long-term quality of life. 
Concurrently, a comprehensive approach is needed for the well-being of all current and future residents that will confront chronic short-term issues, 
while expressing the long-term aspiration to thoughtfully locate and develop a mix of affordable rental and home ownership options. The plan should 
guide all stakeholders including prospective developers, financiers, landlords, and residents, to initiate short-term action to address the most pressing 
conditions in Bangor’s rental units and begin steps to create long-term development and policy changes.  
 
  
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 13 
 Short-term steps the City should take to catalyze action: 
1. Launch Rental Registry with Inspections: The City lacks data on the current supply of rental units in Bangor such as the number, size, and quality of these 
units. To thoughtfully plan for current and future demand for rentals and ensure accountability for quality, the City requires a rental registry program 
with unit inspections. The registry will track this data, identify examples of rental housing neglect, and provide the opportunity to address them. 
 
2. Heightened Accountability for Housing Quality:  The City needs to aggressively enforce existing codes to send a clear message that sub-standard living 
conditions are not allowed. Outreach to landlords is needed, particularly those who are accepting taxpayer subsidies, that highlights this commitment. 
Owners of deteriorating properties should receive notice that they need to make repairs and the City should follow through on timely consequences for 
not doing so. Investment in staff and resources will be required for heightened inspection, inventorying, and accountability of deficient properties. 
 
3. Incentivize Rehabilitation and Development in the Urban Core: The City needs to revise its Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to 
more readily incentivize rehab of rental units and single-family homes. The City also needs to revise the vacant, abandoned, and placarded or foreclosed 
property policies to incentivize and accelerate the timeline for the reuse or demolition of these buildings. These properties are unattractive and create 
broader impacts that diminish neighborhood quality of life and property values. To newcomers and residents alike, they send the wrong message about 
Bangor’s vitality. Tapping into resources outside the city should also be considered for incentives. These might include federal Opportunity Zones, local 
foundations interested in sustaining the historic character of communities and businesses with a vested interest in employee housing. Considering tax 
code adjustments that encourage development of vacant lots in the urban core may also be an option. 
 
4. Develop a Housing Production Plan:  To grow, Bangor needs to sustain and improve current housing and develop new, quality housing.  The housing 
production plan will identify goals and a community rallying cry for the desired shifts in Bangor’s housing market along with the number and type of 
housing that needs to be available to meet demand. The plan will consider current supply and affordability levels along with vacancies and demand in 
each of those categories. Housing can be produced through rehab or new development, and should consider innovative approaches such as accessory 
dwelling units and redevelopment of underutilized properties/land.  
 
5. Update Zoning and Development Standards to Encourage Denser Development in the Urban Core:  The city needs to provide an ideal environment for 
the development of affordable, quality housing through new construction or rehabilitation in its urban core. This development should maintain or 
increase historic density levels. To do this, the City needs to assess and revise zoning and development standards to: a) remove barriers to 
re/development, 2) reflect current uses, 3) encourage the reuse of properties at or above historic density, 4) enable denser development throughout the 
City and 5) identify where to direct future “transit-oriented” residential development. The City should apply evidence-based examples from other 
communities. Potential recommendations include inclusionary zoning that requires developments of a certain scale to include a percentage of 
affordable housing, accessory dwelling units, collectives, and an amnesty program that would bring unidentified, unregulated apartments up to code. 
Some of these standards, in combination with incentives and business engagement, could be launched as pilots in small “transit-oriented mini-villages” 
that are along bus routes and have pedestrian/bike access. These mini-villages, potentially located at or near shopping centers and other important 
services, could provide a mix of single and multi-family residential units, with units dedicated to low-income renters.

Page 14 
 Short-term steps other stakeholders can take to catalyze action:  
1. Increase Supportive Housing Services:   Helping vulnerable populations remain housed or find housing is challenging. Supportive services are 
needed such as: education on home ownership, rental and financial management; group homes with supportive case management; transitional 
housing for individuals released from hospitals and jail, particularly those struggling with mental health and substance use disorder; and 
formalized shared living arrangements for older adults. Bangor has many service providers doing this type of work, but there are gaps and 
potentially areas of duplication. Community service providers should assess the availability of services, define gaps, and work to collaboratively 
meet the community’s needs.   
 
2. Collaboratively Leverage Data Systems to Ease Access to Housing for Vulnerable Populations:  Bangor, as was pointed out to the work group, is 
“program rich, but systems poor”. There are many valuable programs, subsidies, and supports effectively serving people in need. Systems to 
ensure easy access, track and measure results, ensure there isn’t duplication and people don’t fall through the cracks are still lacking. Housing 
service providers are working together and leveraging 2-1-1 as a potential tool to conduct intake and refer people in need to housing. There 
remains an opportunity for deeper collaboration, data sharing and improved referral so people in need don’t need to navigate so many programs, 
requirements and agencies. Supports beyond housing, such as transportation and food, are vital elements in keeping people housed. Service 
providers should convene representatives of Bangor’s many non-profit groups that deal with housing the disadvantaged, poor, and vulnerable in 
our community. The discussion should start now among these organizations to identify how they can develop a system to work collaboratively, in 
conjunction with the owners of these vacant properties and the City to more effectively and efficiently serve the housing interests of those in 
need. According to presenters from non-profits and public safety officials, much of the demand to house vulnerable populations is driven by the 
underlying problem of mental illness and substance use. Navigating each program’s requirements to find help is challenging. As a first step in 
creating a collaborative, cooperative response system, non-profits should conduct a process map for accessing services to identify gaps and 
develop a navigation tool. This can help build upon “2-1-1” or a different centralized data repository to be a resource inventory of available 
services and requirements that anyone can use to help individuals in crisis. 
 
3. Utilize a Stakeholder Committee to Increase Community Engagement on Housing as an Economic Development Strategy:  Addressing the 
housing issues in Bangor is going to take years – it was decades in the making – and will require some changes that initially may be met with a 
“Not In My Back Yard” or “NIMBY” response. To plan for this and to champion ongoing positive housing related changes, a stakeholder group of 
businesses and community leaders should develop a communications plan, a “YIMBY” or “Yes In My Back Yard” advocacy group, and identify 
long-term implementation steps. Employers in the area can play a role through participating in discussions to share the value of housing as a 
workforce development tool, help address the lack of workforce housing, and identify clear steps they can take to increase the number of units 
needed for current and future employees. For example, employers could consider offering housing as a recruitment incentive or housing grants 
for longevity awards or developing their own housing. 
 
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 15 
 Long-term step for all stakeholders: 
1. Review Subsidy Programs and Impacts:  Review state statutes and leverage any opportunities to revise rent subsidy and voucher programs, 
including building and livability standards they demand of participating rental properties. Bangor’s median income is relatively stagnant, the 
regional economy has been slumping for decades as the paper industry declined, yet Bangor’s rents are among the most unaffordable statewide. 
It will be important to ensure quality of rentals where reimbursement is given to landlords reflects the market, so the baseline rent isn’t 
unnecessarily driving up the market for poor quality units. 
The State’s General Assistance (GA) program that the City of Bangor operates and is mandated to help pay for was of particular interest because 
inspections of properties receiving GA rent subsidy are not mandated. All other voucher programs such as Section 8, Shelter Plus Care and BRAP 
require unit inspections. A summer 2018 survey of 75 of Bangor’s GA recipients highlighted numerous quality and safety concerns in units 
including mold and other issues. Last year, GA invested $1.3 million in rent to assist residents in need in the City of Bangor. The Fair Market Rate 
for GA rent assistance uses current average market rent data, but this could provide a distorted rate if over time, subsidies are setting the 
baseline and quality isn’t factored in. 
 
An unavoidable conclusion of the Housing Work Group is that because of the many 
challenges presented by the current state of housing in the city, Bangor should feel 
a sense of urgency to follow through on a plan of action and provide a vision for the 
future of housing, particularly for rental units and vacant properties.  In doing so, 
the Housing Work Group cautioned the city to understand that the circumstances 
of today are cumulative. The Housing Work Group recommends assertive and 
decisive action, tempered by reasonable expectations as results will bear out over 
the long-term.

Step 
1. Launch rental 
registry  City of Bangor - 
Code Enforcement There are several potential 
approaches to this work. A 
menu will be presented to the 
City Council in 2019. Additional 
resources for inspections will 
be shared in the budget in the 
Spring of 2019 that will 
encompass several potential 
approaches. The launch period 
will require more resources 
than long-term operations.  Operational rental registry data system 
that covers all rental units. Includes tiered 
inspections. Data on what exists for the 
number of units and what size and select 
quality measures. 
 
 Consider tracking and awareness of sober 
recovery housing considering recent 
trends in other Maine cities with growing 
development in this field. 
 
 Once resources assigned, 6 
months to launch. Recommend 
starting July 1, 2019 for Dec 2019 
launch. 
 
NEXT STEP: Propose budget for 
resources to City Council in 
Spring 2019.

 MOVING FORWARD 
For significant changes that will improve housing, the community will need to identify measurable goals and use a data driven approach to assess 
results. Developing data systems as a repository and analytical tool to assess, track, inventory and predict needs will be vital for the community to 
support and drive decisions. Data systems will address many items identified in the recommendations. As the City considers updating its 
Comprehensive Plan, it should leverage the visioning work done for its Healthy People Healthy Places and Livable Communities initiatives to define a 
housing vision for the City.  Finally, the City needs to consider how to communicate, market and keep all stakeholders up to date on changes, tools 
and services that come from this work. Ultimately, as this work evolves the community should strive to have: 1) Definitions of success and a way to 
measure them; 2) An understanding of what action steps had the most impact on the problem: 3) A plan for how to share its success and best 
practices. 
 
PROCESS 
In early 2018 the City convened a planning committee to develop  
an educational community engagement process with the goal of 
developing a set of recommendations to improve housing in 
Bangor. A multi-disciplinary work group of more than 20 people 
along with attendees at large from the public participated in 5 
educational panel discussions and then met two more times to 
develop and prioritize potential solutions.  
 
The work group heard from City staff (code enforcement, General 
Assistance and zoning); neighborhood representatives, banks, 
schools, shelters, landlords, developers, Bangor Housing Authority 
and other housing service providers.  
 
Recommendations were then vetted and prioritized.  A small 
subgroup developed high level implementation plans for priority 
recommendations. The recommendations are intended to serve 
as a guide for the entire community – the City, local human 
service organizations, health care providers, businesses and 
residents - to work on to address housing affordability, quality 
and access issues for all current and prospective residents. Bangor 
must continue be a desirable, accessible place not just to work, 
receive services and recreate, but also to live and find a home.

 DATA SUMMARY 
Based on Maine State Housing Authority and Bureau of Labor Statistics data of Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Bangor is less affordable 
for renters than all of Penobscot County, the State of Maine and even larger cities such as Portland. It is similarly unaffordable for purchasing a home 
in Bangor.  See data Table 1 and 2. 
 
Housing quality is also an issue in Bangor. Over 50% of the housing stock in Bangor was built before 1950. The average year built in Bangor is 1963, 
compared to 1974 in the northeast and 1977 nationally. Generally, the per square foot assessed values for these older properties is significantly lower 
than newer housing, a direct reflection of its lower quality. Foreclosures and vacant properties are another source of quality concern in Bangor. A 
property not appropriately prepared that is left vacant through one or two Maine winters can incur so much damage that it cannot be rehabilitated. 
See data Table 3.  
 
Bangor’s population has been relatively stagnant in the last few decades. Comparatively, surrounding towns have had more growth and with that an 
increase in newer, quality housing stock. See data tables 4 and 5 on pages 23 in the Data Summary section. Vacancy rates in Bangor have increased, 
potentially due to quality issues. See Table 7 on page 26. 
 
Bangor also has unique, vulnerable populations that are particularly challenged finding housing in Bangor ranging from people new to the workforce 
to older adults and individuals facing homelessness, health issues or poverty. See Table 8 on page 26. 
 
Landlords and developers face challenges providing affordable, quality housing in aging properties with modern life safety building code 
requirements for rehabbed properties and rental background checks that disqualify a number of potential renters. Regardless, Bangor has a thriving 
rental market supported in part by a variety of rental subsidy programs run by human service organizations and the City of Bangor, some of which 
don’t require unit inspections. Evictions are also relatively high in the Bangor area compared to Maine (Eviction Lab at Princeton University).

TABLE 8: BANGOR’S VULNERABLE POPULATIONS PARTICULARLY STRUGGLE FINDING HOUSING 
 Maine has the oldest median age in the nation. Bangor’s population aged 55+ (13,260) is projected to increase by 6% to 14,067 by 2022 (US Census/ACS). 
 On any given year, approximately 1,200 unduplicated individuals are homeless in Bangor (2016 Bangor shelter and provider data). Persons experiencing 
homelessness are disproportionately affected by issues such as mental health, substance use disorder, and domestic violence. Nearly 65% of homeless 
individuals surveyed stated they have a mental illness diagnosed by a professional. 
 Individuals struggling to make ends meet that access Bangor’s General Assistance program reported in a 2018 survey (96 respondents) that their 
housing is of poor quality and they had difficulty finding housing due to: 1) affordability; 2) turned down by landlords due to evictions, felony record, 
poor credit, etc.; 3) unit didn’t pass inspection for voucher; 4) no apartment large enough; 5) inability to pay security deposit. More than 20% of 
respondents said they feel unsafe in their home or neighborhood because of drug activity. 
 Meeting the housing needs of people new to the workforce or those in the service sector, law enforcement, education and healthcare that are above 
the median income, but still struggle to find quality housing in Bangor are important to consider for Bangor’s vitality and neighborhood quality. 
 As a regional service center, Bangor is home to several human service, housing, and shelter organizations that provide supportive housing, vouchers for 
housing, assistance with home repairs, financial coaching to aide in affordability, legal assistance with rental issues, shelter, transitional housing and 
more. These organizations can work in silos. Accessing needed services in a timely, easy way without having to call multiple agencies and navigating the 
system to qualify for services remains a challenge.

 COMPLETE LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING BANGOR’S HOUSING SITUATION – 5 GOAL AREAS 
Throughout the working group’s sessions, ideas and recommendations were developed. Theses were filtered into 5 goal areas:  
 Improve housing quality 
 House the city’s vulnerable populations 
 Improve affordability of housing 
 Revise zoning and development standards 
 Expand the roles of business, nonprofits, foundations and other stakeholders in addressing housing 
The goals were not prioritized and are not listed in any particular order of importance. The high-level strategies listed under “To improve we need 
to…” are listed in priority order based upon a voting process by the Housing Work Group and the public in attendance. Items that are not bolded did 
not receive any votes. Every other strategy is in gray to separate each new idea. Similarly, the high-level tactics listed under “We will do this by…” are 
listed in order of priority and only items that are bolded received votes for importance. Items in italics were noted as having begun, but not 
necessarily to the full extent envisioned by the work group and are not completed. The work group prioritized them as needing more attention and 
resources or a revised approach to be more impactful. 
Goal 1: Improve the quality of the housing stock in Bangor. 
To improve, we need to: We will do this by: 
1a. Encourage investment in 
maintenance and rehab 
of rental properties. 1. Launch universal rental inspections throughout the City. Start by requiring multi-units undergo an inspection prior to being sold, inspection of 
GA units and in targeted areas of the City in need.

benefits such as expedited permitting, but requires certain building quality standards.  
5. Launch data system for rental registry, inventory, inspections, city service/EMS utilization, public health factors and investments by City  
6. Expand renter education on tenants’ rights, City and other provider services related to housing and other supports that can increase stability. 
7. Provide tiered grading system for rental units based on graduated inspections and improvements made 
8. Develop forgivable maintenance or rehab grants/revolving loan fund for upgrades 
9. Offer amnesty for units not legally created if rehab or sale will create quality units

11. Launch landlord outreach and education program. Set expectations, communicate City standards/ordinances. 
12. Transition rentals to co-ops/condos to increase engagement of residents  
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 28

larger than 4,000 people 
1b. Build more new housing. 
  1. Adjust CDBG program to provide financial incentives to build new housing.   
1c. Transition more 
abandoned/vacant 
properties back into a

6. Collaboratively leverage current housing service providers to utilize these properties to serve vulnerable populations. 
 
1d. Increase rate of  
foreclosed properties 
getting back onto the 
market for sale or 
reclaimed. 1.        Intensify effort to track down ownership rights/banks that control properties. 
2.        Increase use of City policy to take ownership of properties with unpaid taxes. 
 3.        Advocate for statewide policy to address foreclosures and out of state bank communications.

1e. Increase investments in 
maintenance and rehab of 
single-family homes that 
are inhabited.  1. Launch neighborhood, foundation or private equity funding pool for home upgrades managed through a nonprofit, neighborhood groups or 
local business. Seek sponsors/funding. 
2. Incentivize investment with neighborhood recognition. Grants are available this year in Little City and the Tree Streets.  
 3. Survey residents to understand barriers and supports needed.  
4. Set up volunteer/pro bono contractor/ neighborhood home maintenance teams with neighborhood volunteer day. Leverage current 
programs at Alpha One, EAAA, Comfortably Home, Restore. 
5. Leverage media, social media and neighborhood Facebook groups to share positive stories of investment and neighborhood pride and promote 
available resources.

 Goal 2: House the City’s most vulnerable populations. Populations of concern: 
  Homeless: mental health and substance use contribute to homelessness and impact desire for provided shelter/housing as evidenced by encampments. 
 Individuals struggling with mental health and substance use disorder: a primary root cause of challenges finding or maintaining housing is related to brain health. 
 Working poor: economic shifts have created a population that are actively working and trying to maintain housing, but can’t afford rents and necessary expenses including 
transportation, medical care and potentially childcare (25% of Bangor residents are below the federal poverty level). 
 Young workforce (nurse, police officer): even at higher income levels the quality of housing relative to costs in Bangor make it unaffordable. This impacts where this desirable and 
mobile population settles. 
 Older adults: In need of supportive services or a continuum of in-home supports to progress through. 
To improve, we need to: We will do this by: 
2a. Increase access to 
supportive housing 
arrangements. 1. Increase wrap around services and education on home ownership, rental and financial management.  
2. Create more Housing First housing opportunities and adopt this philosophy in housing planning.  
3. Advocate for:  
a. Transitional housing options for individuals being discharged from the hospital or jail that still need supports/housing (Texas Restoration 
Center model). 
b. Group homes with supportive case management. 
c. Formalized shared living situations to simulate extended family supports. 
d. Senior housing and services. 
4. Launch a family shelter(s) for all types of families.  
5. Consider role of Dorothea Dix in mixed use scenario. 
6. Ask group home organizations to work cooperatively with the City to give information about owners/managers/clientele needs to Police and Fire.  
2b. Improve system and 
process for accessing 
housing supports 
including for root cause 
issues such as mental 
health. 1.  Conduct a process mapping exercise of access to housing and supports to identify gaps and develop a community wide navigation guide. 
2. Assess 2-1-1 as a housing access and referral tool and build upon it to: 
a. Conduct shared online intake, referral and data gathering. 
b. Provide real-time housing services/supports availability. 
c. Predict housing demand/access and needs. 
3. Expand use of the Continuum of Care Coordinated Entry and VI-SPDAT as a shared one-stop housing triage and intervention tool.  
4. Work with medical providers to include housing status during physical exams. Housing impacts health. "How frequently have you moved in the 
last 12 months?"; “Do you have safe, secure, affordable housing?” 
5. Conduct asset mapping/inventory of available services. 
6. Advocate for MaineCare expansion to increase mental health treatment access. 
 
 
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 30 
  
2c. Develop city-wide 
understanding of 
demand and capacity. 1. Launch housing services agency collaborative to share data. 
2. Combine organizational wait lists and program capacity.  
2d. Enable older adults to 
age in their homes. 1. Identify and utilize a matching service for older adults in need of support staying in their home to have trustworthy, capable person share 
their home (HomeShare VT model). 
2. Create system for formal and informal networks to work together in neighborhoods to identify and care for elders that may need support 
with shoveling, transportation, etc.

2e. Advocate for funding.  1. Develop strategy to increase state, county and regionwide support of City general assistance and other services provided in Bangor that the 
region relies on.  
2. Develop inventory of service center services leveraged by the region. 
 
  
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 31 
 Goal 3: Improve the affordability of the housing stock in Bangor. 
To improve, we need to: We will do this by: 
3a. Develop a Housing 
Production Plan (HPP). 1. Adopt Housing first approach in planning and development.  
2. Develop short and long-term plans to meet needs from multiple sources e.g. in-laws, large development, etc.   
3. Identify affordability levels, inventory and demand at those prices for rental units in the area. 
4. Identify affordability levels, inventory and demand at those prices for home ownership in the area.  
5. Conduct survey of what affordability means and what barriers are to housing.   
3b. Incentivize and seek 
out small- and large-
scale development to 
meet housing demand. 1. Initiate new funding models with public/private partners to develop housing (Waterville).

3. Reach out to developers successful in other parts of Maine such as Avesta. 
 
4. Utilize Section 8 voucher funds to build shared units, in-laws or accessory dwellings.  
5. Use Incremental Development Alliance method and tools. 
3c. Adopt policies that 
protect tenant’s 
rights and align 
resources to ensure 
housing quality and 
affordability for 
tenants. 1. Improve/reform tenant rental screening. Utilize fair tenant screening – credit report for renters. In addition to legal background checks for rentals, 
allow for recovery/current references or adopt "remove the box" policy. 
2. Consider Tenant Protection Ordinances (Tenant Remedy Act, Rent Escrow Actions if landlord fails to make needed repairs – nonprofit partner 
administrator would withhold rent for repairs). 
3. Nonprofits provide supports pre-eviction to avoid eviction if qualified such as: rides, food, childcare, medical, etc. 
4. Provide formalized system that provides legal assistance to those facing eviction.  
5. Support nonprofit master leases to provide backup for landlord to house high barrier populations. 
6. Create templates for tenant organizing programs for multi-family buildings. 
7. Provide renter education and counseling. 
8. Launch system for individuals with risky rental history to establish references.  
9. Explore eviction regulations with an eye toward protecting tenants’ rights. 
10. Increase ability to expunge eviction from renter’s record when they comply with settlement. 
3d. Review City and 
service provider rent 
subsidy and voucher 
programs. 1. Convene City and service providers to develop and utilize data system to: 
a. Itemize building and livability standards the programs demand of rental properties. 
b. Assess reimbursement rates to ensure they reflect the market versus drive the market. 
c. Develop report of “Who Benefits” for accountability. 
  
3e. Require new 
development to 
provide a percentage 
of affordable 
housing. 1.      Adopt inclusionary zoning for select areas of the City that require a given share of development to be affordable by people with low to moderate 
incomes. 
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 32 
 3f. Advocate for policy 
and programs that 
support affordable

c.  Support funding for CDBG, National Housing Trust Fund, General Assistance. 
2. Share stories of people struggling to find safe, affordable, stable housing. 
  
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 33 
 Goal 4: Proactively revise land use, zoning, ordinances and policy to address housing affordability and quality. 
To improve, we need to: We will do this by: 
4a. Update Bangor’s comprehensive 
plan and zoning to encourage higher 
density, quality, affordable housing 
development 1. Reduce minimum lots sizes and relax density restrictions in single-family zones.   
2. Provide density bonuses in desired areas to allow higher density development in exchange for affordable housing commitments.   
3. Identify areas where residential growth is desirable. 
 
4. Consider demographic trends and types of housing required for growing segments of the population.  
 
5. Ensure updated comp plan considers all types of residential development and isn't biased toward single family homes and low density. 
 
6. Change zoning of infill lots to encourage denser housing development and mixed uses. 
 
7. Engage broad representation on comprehensive plan update committee including housing advocates and people that aren't 
homeowners. 
 
8. If home is demolished, grandfather set back, open space and parking rules for that site. 
4b. Update Bangor’s code / 
ordinances to encourage quality, 
affordable housing development 
in identified areas in the City’s 
developed core/near services. 1. Provide density bonuses in desired areas to allow higher density development in exchange for affordable housing commitments, plus 
where appropriate: 
a. Reduce minimum lots sizes especially where the traditional pattern of development is now illegal (much of in-town Bangor). 
b. Utilize density bonuses, up zoning, minimum density tools.    
c. Use empty or under-utilized space to offer open floor plans with shared communal areas. 
d. Reduce setbacks (front in particular) and transitional yards/buffers and how they might impact the amount of space on parcels 
available for housing. 
e. Allow for accessory dwelling units. 
f. Reduce parking standards considering how that impacts the amount of space available for housing (parking spot + its share of the 
aisle is as big as a 1-bedroom apartment); particularly near public transit. 
g. Consider policy regarding units shifting from rentals/SFO to Air BnB. 
h. Allow for tiny homes (Manufactured Housing Board Safety Standards – skylight egress). 
i. Consider how stormwater management is a potential barrier while upholding Federal mandates. 
j. Encourage walk/bike ability. 
k. Encourage public transit access. 
l. Reduce historic district requirements as a potential barrier. 
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 34 
 4c. Quickly assess zoning and identify 
short-term changes to reflect on 
the ground use; identify where to 
encourage and direct desirable, 
quality residential development. 1. Change zoning to allow in-law apartments or accessory dwelling units in URD1, look at ADUs in other zones as well.  
2. Launch ad hoc city council committee on housing to institute recommended changes and also consider policies such as:  
a. TIFs, particularly a transit-oriented development TIF. 
b. “Public land for public good”.  
c. Expedited permitting for affordable housing. 
d. Put all rental properties on some type of tax basis.  
e. Adjust zoning (on the map) to allow for traditional density in suburban settings near services - more M&SD. 
4d. Identify, prioritize and address 
neighborhood specific 
opportunities – recognizing 
transportation as second highest 
cost to housing for residents. 1. Identify quarter-mile “mini-villages” using lens of transportation/walkability; access to groceries, shopping centers, childcare; parks to 
identify sites in the City to incentivize infill development of housing and transportation investments. Fail fast; fail cheap. 
2. Consider use of land adjacent to services such as shopping centers including underutilized parking lots as potential sites for encouraging 
desirable residential development.  
3. Develop template to use to assess “mini-villages” on livability: transport, housing, services.  
4e. Develop a vision for housing, 
neighborhood and transportation 
lifestyle desired in Bangor. 1. Leverage current documents with public engagement to draft a vision and gather public input online or pull together community members 
from all walks of life and neighborhoods with civic and business leaders to develop a vision 
4f. Educate and engage citizens in 
advocating for policy and 
development that addresses 
Bangor’s housing issues. 1. Recruit and train a “Yes In My Bangor Back Yard” (YIMBY) group – pro-development, supporting housing or other public interest projects 
and practices as counterweight to NIMBY. 
4g. Update zoning, code and 
ordinances for large commercial 
developments that may impact 
potential residential development 1. Reduce parking requirements for large shopping centers e.g. Broadway Shopping Center, the Mall, etc. that aren't used or rarely used 
and consider for residential development.    
2. Incentivize mixed use in high-intensity commercial districts (USD, S&PS, GC&S) currently conditional use in S&PS and USD, but only at 
the density and parking for URD2. Not allowed in GC&S. 
 
  
Bangor Housing Work Group Recommendations 
Page 35 
  
Goal 5: Expand role of businesses, nonprofit partners and foundations in addressing housing issues. 
To improve, we need to: We will do this by: 
5a. Engage businesses to take an active 
interest and ownership for actions to address 
housing as a workforce and economic 
development tool. 1. Develop and maintain an ongoing multi-disciplinary collaborative of businesses, nonprofits and foundations to carry this work
