I am Roger Buck, from Portland, ME. I am opposed to this bill. It is another 
cumbersome paperwork requirement and expense imposed on housing providers. All 
of these additional burdens will eventually be borne by tenants due to less new 
housing construction and higher rents. One does not alleviate a shortage of affordable 
housing by making it more expensive to provide housing.
