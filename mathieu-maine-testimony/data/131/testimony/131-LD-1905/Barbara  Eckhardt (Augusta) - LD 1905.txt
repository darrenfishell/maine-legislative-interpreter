LD 1905
"I vote no on LD 1905 
This law will increase costs on housing providers, which will be passed onto tenants.
-This law does nothing to increase the number of units available to renters in our 
state, which is the true solution to a housing shortage. 
-Increased regulations will drive small housing providers like us out of the business."
