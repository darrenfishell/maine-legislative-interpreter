RE:
LD
1905,
An
Act
to
Create
a
Residential
Rental
Unit
Registry
Dear
Sen.
Pierce,
Rep.
Gere
and
members
of
the
Housing
Committee:
As
the
mayor
of
Lewiston,
I
would
like
to
voice
my
support
for
LD
1905.
The
City
of 
Lewiston
has
already
instituted
a
rental
registration
program
for
the
primary
purpose
of 
ensuring
resident
safety.
A
statewide
administration
of
the
program
would
be
more 
efﬁcient
than
a
patchwork
of
municipalities’
individual
implementations.
In
addition,
we 
would
be
able
to
access
statewide
data
and
observe
trends
and
form
conclusions
which
is 
simply
not
possible
now.
I
appreciate
Representative
Roeder
for
sponsoring
this
bill
and
the
committee’s
time.
Sincerely,
Carl
L.
Sheline
