LD 1905
"I oppose LD1905 because this law will increase costs on housing providers, which 
will be passed onto tenants.
This law does nothing to increase the number of units available to renters in our state, 
which is the true solution to a housing shortage. 
Increased regulations will drive small housing providers like us out of the business."
