T estimony
in

of

“ A n
Act

Unit
Registr y ”
Good
morning
Senat or
Pier ce,
Repr esentativ e
Ger e,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Housing.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
1905,
An
Act
t o
Cr eate
a
Residential
Rental
Unit
Registr y . ”
My
home
city
of
Lewist on
cr eated
a
r ental
r egistr ation
pr ogr am
a
f ew
y ears
ago,
and
it
has
been
a
success
in
gathering
impor tant
housing
data
as
well
as
pr o viding
both
tenants
and
city
staff
with
contact
information
in
the
case
of
an
emer gency
or
issues
with
a
building
that
need
t o
be
addr essed.
I
ser v e
on
the
city ’ s
Housing
Committee,
which
has
been
taking
a
look
int o
the
data
fr om
this
r egistr y
t o
determine
what
our
curr ent
housing
situation
is
and
wher e
we
need
t o
go
fr om
her e.
The
data
r egar ding
the
number
and
siz e
of
units
in
each
building,
v acancy
r ate,
ownership
tr ends,
etc.
has
pr o v en
inv aluable
in
this
effor t.
Another
major
issue
that
a
r ental
r egistr y
can
addr ess
is
tenants
and
municipal
staff
not
knowing
who
t o
contact
when
ther e
is
an
issue
with
a
r ental
unit.
Lewist on ’ s
r ental
r egistr ation
pr ogr am
r equir es
that
a
cer tiﬁcate
be
posted
in
the
common
ar ea
of
each
building
with
the
name
and
phone
number
of
a
pr oper ty
manager
for
tenants
t o
call
in
case
of
an
emer gency .
The
city
also
collects
the
name
and
contact
information
of
pr oper ty
owners,
since
public
ownership
r ecor ds
often
only
attribute
buildings
t o
anonymous
LL Cs.
I
also
speak
as
a
local
landlor d
who
wants
t o
pr o vide
quality
housing
t o
my
tenants
and
impr o v e
the
r ental
experience.
Pr o viding
r ental
r egistr y
information
only
tak es
a
f ew
minutes
of
my
time,
but
it
can
giv e
v aluable
insights
t o
municipalities
as
t o
the
state
of
r ental
housing
in
the
community .
Please
v ote
Ought
T o
P ass
on
LD
1905.
Thank
y ou
for
y our
time
t oda y .
