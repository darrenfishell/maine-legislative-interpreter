Senator Pierce (pronounced PURSE), Representative Gere, and honorable membe rs of the Joint 
Select Committee on Housing:  my name is April Tomah. I am a housing navigator with Wabanaki 
Public Health and Wellness, and I am here today to testify in favor of LD 1905.  
 
As a housing navigator, my  role is to work with  Native American  tenants across  the state. Unlike 
many housing navigators who do not work with  the Native community . I cover all tribes  in maine . 
There isnâ€™t enough housing on reservation for all tri bal members,  so the tribal members look for 
housing elsewhere .  
 
A key part of my work is developing relationships and trust with landlords to help them feel more 
comfortable with taking on tenants who may not appear as reliable. That means one of the greatest 
barriers to securing housing for the people I work with is not knowing the landlords across  Maine  
and what is available.  
 
It is hard for me  find housing  in the pl aces that I don't usually  work in. I have clients that 
live down sout hern Maine  northern Maine . some of these areas I'm n ot familiar with . A lot 
of the times  I must Google  what cities are in what county . 
 
 
If this data were available, it would make a huge difference. To do my job now  I use all of the 
application finders  on the Internet . I believe this database will help me do my job more efficiently  
and to help  me find housing  for my clients . I work with  tribal members that live across Maine.  
  
Housing navigators are playing an important role in our housing crisis. I am support of this bill  for 
the simple fact being able to find thing for my clients  on this database . Supporting the creation of a 
rental registry is supp orting the work of housing navigators.  
 
Thank you for your time and I am happy to take any questions.
