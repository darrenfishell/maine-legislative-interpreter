Honorable representatives + senators;
My name is Siiri Cressey. I am a resident of Lewiston. I am writing in support of LD 
1905.
Maine's housing, especially urban rental housing, is in great demand. Many people 
are searching for a place to live. A centralized list of apartment building owners 
would help streamline the process of finding good landlords/ladies with available, 
affordable units. I believe having a publicly available list instead of needing to work 
piecemeal would ease some of the stress of looking for a home.
