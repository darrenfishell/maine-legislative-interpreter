LD 1905
My name is Robert Poole. I am a housing provider, and own twenty-two rental units 
in the town of Brunswick.  I am writing to express strong opposition to LD1905. If 
enacted, LD1905 would be bad for housing providers and tenants alike for the 
following reasons:
1. LD1905 would create administrative burden for housing providers (this is bad for 
housing providers). Administrative costs and registration fees would be passed along 
to tenants (this is bad for tenants). 
2. Costs and risks associated with failure to register rental units, along with increased 
administrative burden will drive housing providers to seek alternate uses for their 
properties (this is bad for housing providers and tenants).
3. Registration of housing units discourages future investment in Maine rental 
housing by providing the basis for future rent control, similar to that which was 
enacted in Portland (this is bad for housing providers and tenants). 
Again, LD1905 is bad for housing providers and tenants, and I strongly oppose it. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Robert Poole
