TESTIMONY OF VICTORIA FOLEY, DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT THE MAINE 
DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC 8: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, REGARDING LD 1905, AN ACT 
TO CREATE A RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNIT REGISTRY 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere and members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing, my 
name is Victoria Foley and I am the Director of Legislative Affairs at the Department of Economic 
& Community Development. l am here today to present testimony in opposition to LD 1905, An 
Act to Create a Residential Unit Registry. 
The bill would require that the Department of Economic and Community Development create an 
online portal which landlords can use to register their units voluntarily, provide an online 
calculator to allow landlords to determine whether they are charging a fair market rent, and 
make publicly accessible a searchable online database of residential rental units in the State of 
Maine. 
Governor Mills and her Administration remain committed to responding to Maine's 
unprecedented housing crisis with urgency and action through meaningful and impactful use of 
state resources. We recognize and take seriously the challenge of finding housing herein Maine. 
However, we would like to share our concerns about the ability to implement this bill in a way 
that is meaningful and useful for Maine people. 
As anyone who has sought rental housing will understand, it is often the case that a listing is out- 
of-date or the apartment has been rented almost as soon as it pops up online. The task of keeping 
a rental registry updated and thus useful to Maine people seeking rental housing would require 
significant technology investments and the addition of staff to manage contact with 
municipalities and landlords of all sizes across the state. 
It may be helpful context for the committee to know that the Department does not currently act 
as a regulatory body, nor does the Department have the technological capabilities to build or 
manage a registry of this proposed scope. Even after the significant investment required to build 
out the portal proposed in the bill, the ongoing personnel costs of maintaining and updating it 
would be substantial.

JANET T. MILLS HEATHER JOHNSON 
GOVERNOR COMMISSIONER 
The Maine State Housing Authority estimates that Maine has more than 154,000 rental 
households. It is unclear how many other rental units — such as the spare room rented out to 
help with costs — there are in the state. 
As we considered the requirements proposed in this bill, we were unable to find any states that 
have successfully launched rental registries of this type. Large municipalities — and some here in 
Maine — have established rental registries. There is also a searchable online registry that already 
exists for affordable, accessible, and market-rate housing, although we understand that there is 
significant challenge around the cost of updating and maintaining it which limits its utility to 
Maine renters. 
We believe the bill is well-intentioned. We further understand that there is some amended 
language that would strike the language related to restricting evictions for unregistered 
landlords. However, at this time, it is unclear to the Department how creating a new rental 
registry under DECD that shows static and quickly outdated information will help Maine people 
find safe, affordable, and available rental housing when they really need it. 
Thank you for your consideration of our testimony, and I would be happy to take any questions.
