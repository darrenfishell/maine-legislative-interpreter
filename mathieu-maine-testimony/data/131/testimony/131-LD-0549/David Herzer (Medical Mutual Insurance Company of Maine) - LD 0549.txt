Re: i..D. 549 "An Act Regarding a Discovery Rule for the Statute of Limitations for 
Cases of Medical Negligence" 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Distinguished Members of the Committee, 
My name is David Herzer. I am the Vice President of Claims at Medical Mutual 
insurance Company of Maine (”Medical Mutual"). Medical Mutual was founded in 1978 bya 
group of 12 physicians in response to the medical professional liability insurance crisis leaving 
few affordable options for coverage in Maine. Today, it insures about 3,800 physicians, 2,600 
advanced practice providers, 38 hospitals, 73 nursing homes, and 43 allied healthcare facilities 
in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. in Maine, specifically, the company 
insures about 85% of the medical community comprising those demographics. As its name 
suggests, Medical Mutual is a "mutual" insurance company, which means that it is owned by its 
individual and institutional medical professional policyholders. 
My background includes (i) two years as the Vice President of Claims for Medical Mutual 
overseeing a team of four Claims Representatives handling about 300 medical professional 
liability claims at any given time; (ii) 28 years as a litigation attorney at Norman, Hanson& 
DeTroy working primarily with insurers and insureds in defending liability claims in medical 
malpractice and other contexts; (iii) nine years on the Professional Ethics Commission of the 
Board of Bar Overseers (the last two as its Chairperson); and (iv) nine years on the Advisory 
Committee on the courts’ Rules of Civil Procedure. 
In short, lam writing on behalf of Medical Mutual and its policyholders to oppose LD 
549's pure discovery rule statute of limitations. Enacting a statute that no longer tethers the 
start of the limitations period to a fixed date in time — currently, from the date the medical care 
was rendered or forgonel -— will increase the risk exposure for all medical care providers and 
1 
The current statute of limitations also has a discovery rule allowing suit for damages caused by the leaving ofa 
foreign object in the body within three years from when the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have

practitioners and for their vicariously liable employers. In turn, it will force an increase in the 
premium rates for the liability insurance that isintended to protect them from that risk. In an 
effort to control those rising premiums, the medical community will be compelled to share 
more of the risk themselves in the form of increased self-insured retentions or deductibles and 
by entering co-participation programs in which they contribute a percentage of the dollars paid 
by Medical Mutual for a claim. 
The Legislature has made no determination of the need for, or consequences of, sucha 
drastic change to the statutory scheme enacted in 1985 that was the subject of exhaustive 
study, debate, and negotiations by Legislators, Committees, Work Groups, individual lawyers 
and legal trade organizations, members of the medical community and their trade associations, 
and insurance industry representatives for two years prior to the enactment of the Maine 
Health Security Act in its current form. To enact this Bill and completely change the statute of 
limitations, furthermore, would be to repeal the component of that well-vetted statutory 
scheme that was supported by empirical study and statistical analysis predictive of its positive 
impact on the number of claims filed, or claim frequency, and therefore insurance premiums.2 
Now is the wrong time to effect a sea change in the medical professional liability 
landscape by indefinitely extending the legal liability of all providers and practitioners for every 
patient they treat. Claim Severity has been trending significantly higher in New England and 
across the nation. An unlimited window of time to bring claims in Maine will compound that 
claim severity trend and increase claim frequency, too. A pure discovery rule statute of 
limitations with no limit would make Maine one of a handful of outlierjurisdictions, at least one 
of which pays higher premiums currently. Maine residents continue to face accessibility 
challenges when they seek medical care that will be exacerbated by an indefinite extension of 
discovered the harm. The mere presence of a foreign object obviates much, if not all, of the debate abouta 
standard of care breach and causation that would be the central subjects in a typical medical liability claim. 
Therefore, the concerns about missing witnesses, faulty memories, lost records, and other consequences of a stale 
claim and their impact in hindering a medical care provider's defense are not implicated in the case ofa foreign 
body. Choroszy v. Tso, 647 A.2d 803, 807 (Me. 1994). 
Z 
The Commission to Examine Problems of Tort Litigation and Liability insurance in Maine was tasked by the 112"‘ 
Legislature to investigate the liability insurance crisis at that time and its impact on Maine citizens and to evaluate 
various tort reform responses. in its December 1987 report, the Commission mentioned a General Accounting 
Office study of the impact on medical malpractice insurance of the tort reforms enacted in the 19705. "One of the 
few-existing empirical studies cited in the GAO report was produced for the Rand Corporation by Patricia Danzon. 
Ms. Danzon's statistical analysis of the impact of state tort reforms on medical malpractice insurance rates leads 
her to the following conclusions: States that have reduced statutes of limitations by adults and set out limits on 
discovery rules have experienced less growth in claim frequency than states with statutes more favorable to 
plaintiffs. . . ." Report of the Commission to Examine Problems of Tort Litigation and Liability Insurance in Maine,

providers ’ and practitioners ’ legal liability for providing that care and the increased cost of 
insuring for that added liability risk. 
l. Claim Severity is trending significantly higher in New England and across the nation. 
Those who follow the news about the medical professional liability industry know that 
reports of "claim severity, ” i.e., the cost of an individual claim in defense expenses and 
indemnity dollars, is rising at an alarming rate for all claims, let alone those claims yielding the 
”nuc|ear" verdicts that make general media headlines. This upward trend can be found across 
the nation, in New England, and in Maine specifically. 
Medical Mutual monitors its claims data in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and 
Massachusetts on an ongoing basis and has studied that data to understand the claim severity 
experience among its own insureds. ‘ Among the takeaways about the severity trend in Maine 
are the following. 
0 The average of the annual indemnity payments made over the six years spanning 
2017 to 2022 increased by 52% as compared to the average paid in the eight-year 
period from 2009 to 2016. 
0 For the seventeen years spanning 2000 to 2016, the largest amount paid in 
indemnity for a settlement or verdict was $4.75MM. 
0 Over the past seven years, from 2017 to 2023, there have been 9 claims in which the 
indemnity payment or the jury verdict exceeded $4.75MM, with a high of $9.5MM 
and an average of $6.4MM. 
0 Of those 9 claims exceeding the prior seventeen-year high-water mark, Maine is 
responsible for six, with a high of $9.5MM and an average of $6.8MM. 
0 For the first quarter of 2023, Medical Mutual has paid more in indemnity than it paid 
in the entire years of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 - and it paid just $114,000 
less this quarter than 2019's total. 
Medical Mutual’s experience is shared by insurers and their medical professional 
insureds nationwide. For example, The Doctor's Company is the nation's largest physician- 
owned medical malpractice insurer, with over 84,000 member-insureds. it publishes liability 
claims data and analysis to assist in identifying trends among its members’ claims. Among the

recent takeaways on the issue of claim severity The Doctor's Company has found are the 
following? 
0 The average payment for a closed medical malpractice case has been growing well 
beyond the pace of inflation since 2014. 
¢ There has been a 55% increase in claim severity from 2000 to 2018.4'5 
1 From 2014 to 2018, the number of verdicts in excess of $25 million more than 
tripled. “ 
0 From 2010 to 2019, the average of the top 100 jury awards for medical malpractice 
cases increased by almost half.

and increase claim frequency, too.

While medical professional liability claim severity is trending significantly higher, the 
trend of "claim frequency," i.e., the number of claims made, has plateaued by some measures7 
and reduced by others. The Doctor's Company reports that it has seen a reduction in the 
number of claims brought against its physician-member insureds from a high of 17 claims per 
100 physicians to fewer than seven claims per 100 physicians? Medical Mutual's claim 
frequency reflects a trending reduction that has continued through the Pandemic years and 
into 2023. It is anticipated that claim frequency will rebound as the courts’ backlogs clear and 
lawsuits return to a pre-Pandemic pace, however. 
Extending the time during which medical care providers and practitioners are exposed 
to liability beyond the current three years from a date certain — the date when the care was 
rendered or forgone -to an indeterminable date three years from when the patient discovers 
or reasonably should have discovered the harmg necessarily means that Maine claim frequency 
will increase. An indefinite extension of the time to file suit expands the group of eligible 
plaintiffs significantly. With that expansion in the number of suing plaintiffs bringing new 
claims comes an increase in claim frequency and in the upward trend of claim severity. Some of 
the new claims will be resolved by large settlements or verdicts, affecting the settlement or 
verdict severity numbers cited above. But all of those new claims, large or small, will contribute 
to an overall increase in the defense costs Medical Mutual and its policyholders incur. 
The Bill's discovery rule provision means more litigation and costs in a category of 
liability claims that already is litigious and expensive. The determination of when a patient 
discovered or reasonably should have discovered the harm does not lend itself to an 
expeditious and cost-effective decision by a judge on a motion, as the current date-certain 
statute of limitations does. Instead, the discovery rule standard requires factual findings that 
are not properly made by a judge in the vast majority of cases. When a patient discovered the 
harm and whether they reasonably should have discovered it sooner are factual findings that 
generally must be made by a jury on the basis of admissible evidence in a trial.

9 It is unclear whether "harm" in this statute will be interpreted by the courts to mean the injury alone or the injury 
and its medical negligence cause. Starting the three-year clock for filing suit from when the patient discovered not 
only the injury, but also that it was caused by a breach of the medical standard of care is far more expansive a 
period of time than from when the patient discovers, merely, that they have suffered an injury.

Ill. A pure discovery rule statute of limitations with no limit would make Maine one ofa 
handful of outlier jurisdictions. 
Currently, only 11 jurisdictions in the United States have a statute of limitations stating a 
discovery rule without any limit in the form of a repose provision to cap the number of years to 
bring suit. One of those jurisdictions is New Hampshire. A medical professional liability insurer 
in those jurisdictions necessarily assumes more risk by issuing an insurance policy to covera 
health care provider or practitioner who is exposed to liability claims longer. More risk, of 
course, means higher premiums. Medical Mutual's premium rates for New Hampshire family 
practice and general surgery, for example, are 75% higher than the rates for their Maine 
counterparts, in large part due to the added risk exposure posed by the open-ended statute of 
limitations in New Hampshire. 
lV. Maine residents continue to face accessibility challenges when seeking medical care 
that only can be exacerbated by an unlimited extension of the legal liability for 
providing that care. 
It has been true for some time that patients in parts of Maine suffer from limited access 
to medical care. The New England Rural Health Roundtable observed, - 
Establishing and maintaining health care resources in rural areas 
is an ongoing struggle, and solutions that may work in more urban 
settings are often not practical in a rural context. . .. 
Discrepancies regarding the availability and mix of primary care 
providers, and related access indicators, persist and are likely to 
expand. Primary medical care provider levels are up regionally, 
but remain lower in Rural areas. The rural physician workforce is 
also older, suggesting that this gap could widen in coming years. 
Rural areas continue to be more dependent on non-physician 
providers for primary care, which may help offset losses of 
physicians in the future, but the level of growth in Physician 
Assistants was faster in Metro areas.1° 
Those difficulties are not limited to the delivery of primary care, but include specialty 
care too. Hospital obstetric care units that once serviced largely rural areas have been closing 
at an alarming pace. Five l\/laine hospitals have ceased to provide obstetrics services since 
2015, the latest of which was on March 31, 2023:

Exacerbating the care accessibility problem is the financial condition of Maine's hospital 
systems. Northern Light Health, for example, has been forced by financial constraints to reduce 
is service offerings, including closing a primary care practice in Orono and a specialized 
rehabilitation program at Eastern Maine Medical Center. Northern Light Health suffered a 
$131.7 million loss in the fiscal year that ended September 2022. 
But Northern Light Health is not alone. Approximately two-thirds of Maine's hospitals 
reported negative operating margins during the first half of 2022. ”{A]ccording to data 
analyzed by the firm Franklin Trust Ratings — which provides health care insights to a range of 
clients — the median operating profit margin for many Maine hospitals was negative 17.74% in 
the most recently reported fiscal year, down from negative 11.1% in the prior year/'11 
MaineHealth has increased wages to its existing employees in order to keep pace with inflation 
and has been using private staffing agencies at much higher pay rates in order to compensate 
for staffing shortages, both of which measures have caused financial strain. "Hospital officials 
and experts point to a variety of reasons for the [financial] troubles, including a shrinking of 
Maine's hospital workforce from a recent high of more than 34,000 in 2017, down to 31,000 by 
early 2021, according to state labor data/'12 
The Maine medical community will struggle to recover from the financial challenges 
caused by the exodus of medical professionals and the other financial challenges generated by 
the Pandemic for some time. ”2023 will likely be a year of upheaval and market transformation

. . . Margins are not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels for quite some time.’ "14 
The unlimited extension of medical professional liability exposure caused by a pure 
discovery rule statute of limitations — and the rise in insurance premiums and increased shared 
risk options in the form of self-insured retentions, deductibles, and co-participation programs 
that will follow - can only compound that financial stress. Roughly 80% of Medical Mutual’s 
premiums charged to its hospital-insureds are attributed to the liability risks posed by their 
employed physicians, so hospitals that already are struggling financially likely will see the 
biggest impact. However, hospitals will not suffer alone; the Bill's discovery rule limitation will 
drive premium rates and risk-sharing higher for individual physician practices, nursing homes, 
and allied healthcare facilities too. 
Conclusion 
What the medical community and the insurance industry that protects its interests need 
in these turbulent times is more stability, not more upheaval. This Bill will put Maine at risk ofa 
reprise of the insurance availability and cost crisis that was the genesis of the Maine Health 
Security Act's 1985 measures, including its statute of limitations, which measures were studied, 
crafted, debated, and negotiated by this body over the course of two years. There has been no 
such vetting of the purported need for this Bill's sea change in the law or the consequences it 
will visit upon the medical community or the Maine patients who need access to its services.
