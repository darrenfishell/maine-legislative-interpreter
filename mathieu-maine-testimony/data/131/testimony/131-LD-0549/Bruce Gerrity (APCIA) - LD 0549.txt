RE: LD 549 – An Act Regarding a Discovery Rule for the Statute of Limitations 
for Cases of Medical Negligence 
Dear Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, 
This submission augments the American Property Casualty Insurance Association’s 
(“APCIA”) testimony in opposition to LD 549.  As was mentioned in oral testimony, changing 
medical technology makes it difficult to evaluate a medical malpractice claim as if the standard 
of care might be static.  Prostate cancer screenings are a good example of how technology 
changes.  Attached is an article  from the University of Chicago Medicine discussing the 
changing medical philosophy around prostate specific antigen (“PSA”) testing.  In short, the 
longer the statute of limitations, the more likely it becomes that the standard to be applied in 
reviewing the claim morphs and the distinct potential exists that attorneys will dispute what the 
standard of care is or should be.  The current statute of limitations avoids that problem.  APCIA 
is pleased to submit this additional information for the Committee’s consideration. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Bruce C. Gerrity
