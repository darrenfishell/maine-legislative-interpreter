Re: L.D. 549, An Act Regarding a Discovery Rule for the Statute of Limitations for Cases of 
Medical Negligence 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 549.  This bill has broad public policy 
implications for the Committee to consider. This letter focuses on medical professional liability 
insurance and health care costs. 
L.D. 549 addresses the statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions, which is currently 
three years from the date of the occurrence for most claims. This bill would change that statute of 
limitations to three years from the date of discovery of the injury or the date the plaintiff 
reasonably should have discovered the injury. 
This bill, if enacted, will extend the period in which a claim may be filed and will result in more 
claims, larger insurer expenses and greater uncertainty when premiums are established to cover 
medical professional liability costs. Not only will there be more cases, but there will also be 
increased litigation on issues relating to when the plaintiff discovered or reasonably should have 
discovered the injury, and whether and to what extent the injury is caused by the alleged 
malpractice or by other events or factors. 
Maine previously had a two-year statute of limitations with a discovery standard. To address the 
problem of claims filed many years after the act or omission for which negligence was asserted, 
the law was revised to a period from the time of the cause of action, with an extension from two 
to three years and an exception for foreign objects left in the body. At that time, malpractice 
insurance costs were increasing for many reasons and there was an medical malpractice coverage 
availability crisis, with insurers withdrawing from this line of insurance. 
Today, Maine market for medical malpractice insurance is highly concentrated. One company 
writes almost 80% of the coverage in Maine. Surplus lines coverage represents about 11.1% of 
the market, an indication that some policyholders could not find coverage from a company 
licensed in the admitted market. 
To the extent that increased claims resulting from the bill increase medical malpractice insurance 
costs or medical practice procedures to avoid or defend against claims, an increase in health care

costs can reasonably be expected. The Bureau, however, cannot quantify the anticipated cost 
effect of the bill to Mainers. 
I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance.
