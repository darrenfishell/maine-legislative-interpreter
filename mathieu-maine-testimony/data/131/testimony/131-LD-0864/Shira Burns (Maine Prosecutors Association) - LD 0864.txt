“An Act to Clarify Provisions of the Maine Good Samaritan Law ”  
Before t he Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety  
Public Hearing Date: May 9 , 2024  
Testimony in Support of  LD 864  
 
Senator Beebe -Center , Representative Salisbury  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public S afety . My name is Shira Burns and I represent th e Maine Prosecutors 
Association. I am here to testify in support of LD 864.  
 
This is purely a bill to correct an error from last session that didn ’t include the whole Endangering the 
Welfare of a Child statute as a crime that is ex empted from the Good Samaritan law. It was the intent of the 
law to include this crime, but because of a citation  error, it only included one subsection  of the law.  
 
 For these reasons, the Maine Prosecutors Association is in support of LD 864.        STATE OF MAINE
