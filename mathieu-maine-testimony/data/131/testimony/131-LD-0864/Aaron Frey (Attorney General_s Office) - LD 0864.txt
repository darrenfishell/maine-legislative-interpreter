Re: L.D. 864, An Act to Claryfy Provisions of the Maine Good Sanulritan Law 
Gieetings, Senatoi Beebe-Centei, Repiesentatiye Salisbuiy, 
l’in wiiting today in suppoit of what I undeistand will be the amended veision of L ll 
) 864, 
An Act to Claryjt Pi ovisions 0/ the Maine Good Samar: mm Law 
Last session, the Legislatuie made signiﬁcant ievisions to the “Good Samaritan ” statute, 
expanding the scope of immunity })l0Vld\8(l by Section llll-B in Title l7-A. Following those 
changes, my office worked with both law enfoicement paitners and the iecoveiy community to 
educate on the icvised immunity 
The expanded immunity continued to exclude ceitain criminal offenses, which meant the 
immunity continued to be unavailable fol ceitain ciimes Geneially, these exclusions weie foi 
violent ciinies, sexual offenses, and ciimes committed against childi en. Aftéi passage, it was 
iecogiiived this ievised immunity inadveitently covcied some ciimes against childien, which we 
undeistand was not intended Speciﬁcally, only one disciete pait of the Endangeiing the Welfaic 
of a Child statutoiy section was excluded fiom immunity piotection 
y Passage of L D 864 will coiiect this issue lt will exclude fioin immunity all foiiiis of 
Endangeiing the Welfare of a Child, as well as any ciiminal offense committed against a min‘o1 
This will piovide consistency in how ciiminal offenses aie tieated by the immunity It will also 
eiisuie that the ci iminal jUS[lCC system may continue to hold accountable patents O1 othei cai etakcis 
who fail to caie loi the health and safety of Mainc’s childien Foi these ieasons, I uige you to 
suppoit toi L D. 864
