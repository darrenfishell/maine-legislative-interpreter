Senator Rafferty. Representative Brennan and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs, please accept this testimony in support of LD 343, An Act to Invest in an 
Educational Technician Training Program to Address Shortages in Public Schools on behalf of the 
Maine Community College System. 
Earlier this fall. we were approached by the Maine Education Association to discuss the successful 
Learning Facilitator program at EMCC. Throughout the course ofthat conversation, MEA asked us 
what we needed to continue and expand the program. We discussed the language changes proposed in 
LD 1366. Another of the suggestions from the program managers (who you will hear from today) was 
the ability to offer stipends to the mentor teachers. A third was a smaller amount of additional funding to 
further the reach of the program and continue to offer it at no cost to the students. Further conversations 
with Rep. Brennan led to this initiative and we appreciate his support. 
More details will be provided by EMCC, however, we want to make it clear from the System standpoint 
that we ﬁrmly believe the teachers who dedicate their time and effort to train our students should be 
offered a stipend for that work. At this time, only some ofthe school districts enrolled in our program 
qualify for stipends. This funding will allow us to provide stipends in all participating school districts. 
l urge you to support this bill, and l would be happy to answer any questions you may have. 
Thank you.
