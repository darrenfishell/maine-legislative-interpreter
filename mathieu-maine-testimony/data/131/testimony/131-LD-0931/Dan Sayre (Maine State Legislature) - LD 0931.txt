T estzmony of Representatzve Daniel Sayre, sponsor of LD 931, An Act to Expand the State's Workforce by Supporting the Transition from 
Incarceration to Employment 
Before the Jomt Standing Commzttee on Crzmznal Justzce and Publzc Safely 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, I am Representative Daniel Sayre of 
Kemiebunk, and I present for your consideration LD 931, An Act to Expand the State's 
Workforce by Supporting the Transition from Incarceration to Employment 
I am here at the urging of local business leaders, Jean G1D1'1 Marvin and Colby Marvin Bracy of the Nonantum Resort, who called to my attention their expenence with hiring people who have transitioned out of incarceration Most of these employees have successfully reentered the 
workforce, but they confronted many obstacles in making this transition So, Ms Marvin and Ms Bracy encouraged me to introduce a bill to ease that transition and reduce those obstacles 
The bill as submitted 1S a concept draft containing a set of recommendations for legislative action 
derived from the Jail Navigator Focus Group on Transition/Reentry Recommendations to the 
Full Committee, November 2022 I have since learned that these recormnendations may not 
reﬂect the ﬁnal conclusions of all participants in this effort 
I recognize that the bill before you is a bit of a laundry list I would like to narrow its scope to 
items 2 and 5 » 
Items 2 and 5 aim to do 3 things First, provide intensive case managers (ICMs) at a ratio of1 
for each 20 residents Second, help reduce residents overcome the major barriers to successful 
reintegration into the community by having the ICM’s gtude them toward essential services, such as housing, transportation, food security and healthcare And third, provide residents leaving 
incarceration with certain essential goods, such as personal hygiene items, fentanyl test strips, 
naloxone hydrochloride, a cellular telephone with limited minutes and recovery and prevention 
literature 
To elaborate in a bit more detail 
1 The provision of Intensive Case managers The bill currently references only _]a1lS, but 
both _]8.llS and prisons should be covered by an ICM program Further, the ratio of 
managers to residents may vary in consideration of the terms of incarceration and

resources avallable to d1fferent resldents An othenmse law-ab1d1ng 1nd1v1dual who 
spends afew hours 1n a county _]a1l 1s not l1kely to requrre the same level of care as 
someone Who has served a mult1-year sentence and who may be facmg a lack of houslng, 
employment, health coverage and a need for cont1nued pI'OfCSS101 ’l8.l care for substance 
use dlsorder or physlcal or mental health challenges The means to determme stafﬁng 
levels for ICMs requ1res further analysls and the 1nvo1vement of both the DOC and the 
Sherlffs as Well as representatlves of HHS and the recovery and reentry advocacy 
commumtles 
2 Development of an assessment methodology to determlne mdlvldual needs and 
resources Any requlrement for the state to provlde speclﬁc resources or referral to 
speclﬁc servlces should be based on the need of the 1nd1v1dua1 to I‘6CC1V€ those resources 
and on the1r ab1l1ty to provlde for those resources themselves 
3 Distrlbutlon of Sll[)pll6S for reentry to the workforce. Provldmg supplles such as pre- 
pald phones, medlcatlons, hygrene products, and the l1ke may be essentlal for some 
1nd1v1duals, but they should be dlstnbuted based on demonstrated need And 1t 1s the 
funct1on of the assessment methodology descnbed above to determme that need 
In all frankness, none of these 3 goals are adequately artlculated 1n the b1ll before you I would 
l1ke to request that th1s commlttee cons1der carry1ng th1s b1ll over to the next sesslon so that thls 
work can be completed 
I thank you for your conslderatlon, and I vv11l be happy to address any quest10ns you mrght have
