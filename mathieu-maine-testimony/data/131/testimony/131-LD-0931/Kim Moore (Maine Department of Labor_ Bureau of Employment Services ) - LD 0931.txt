Re:  LD 931, An Act to Expand the State ’s Workforce by Supporting the T ransition from Incarceration to 
Employment   
 
Senator Beebe-Center , Representative Salisbury , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
I am writing to provide information  regarding  the current work being done by the MDOL Bureau of Employment 
Services (BES)  in the reentry space , in relation to  LD 931, An Act to Expand the State ’s Workforce by Supporting the 
Transition from Incarceration to Employment .  
MDOL Bureau of Employment Services (BES) Career Consultants regularly provide on -site CareerCenter services 
and resources needed for a successful transition including help with resumes and cover letters, job search tec hniques 
and interviewing skills customized for individuals with a justice -involved history, connection to training programs 
and supportive programs, etc.  at locations including the Bath Community Recovery Center, Travis Collins House, 
Windham Correctional  Center, Recovery Connections of Maine, Somerset County Jail, Mountainview Correctional 
Facility, etc.  In addition, staff provide employment services at the probation offices in Waterville and Augusta as 
individuals on probation make their regular visits with their probation officers, with services being expanded to youth 
on probation.  The Augusta CareerCenter is also a key partner in Kennebec County Jail’s CARA (Criminogenic 
Addiction & Recovery Academy) program.  CareerCenter staff lead Workforce Connec tions sessions 5 -7 times 
during the ten -week program and cover employment -related topics from preparing for a job search through 
interviewing skills, mock interview sessions, and follow -up.  CareerCenter staff introduce residents to partner 
agencies and su pporting community resources to assist in their transition from jail to the community.  
 
Correction liaisons (vocational rehabilitation counselors) have been assigned to both County and State jails through 
our MDOL Bureau of Rehabilitative Service (BRS) wit h services for individuals with disabilities beginning 3 months 
prior to release.  These liaisons work with reentry staff and resident to identify community needs and services, 
coordinate with community case managers and probation for ongoing planning, and  assist with community referrals 
including housing, medical, and medical health services.  BRS also partners with the MDOL Bureau of Employment 
Services (BES) to coordinate re -entry planning, which includes delivery of career exploration workshop (Women’s 
Reentry Center), and dedicated re -entry planning for Veteran’s with BES Veteran Services (both County and State).  
 
Lastly, MDOL administers federal WIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act) programs which target 
services to individuals re -entering fro m incarceration and those in recovery.  Service providers for these programs 
employ peer support workers - those with lived experience and knowledge of the scope of services available in the 
community in which the individual resides.  These workers have est ablished strong statewide connections with 
  
  
 
pg. 2  organizations and agencies including the Maine Prisoner Reentry Network (MPRN), Intensive Case Managers for the 
jails, Maine Recovery Advocacy Project (ME -RAP), the Treatment Court Steering Committee, Maine Pretri al 
Services, and recovery centers through the Recovery HUB. WIOA programs and staff help individuals with career, 
employment, and training services including paid on the job training opportunities and work experiences that permit 
the transitioning individu al to try -out employment within a specific industry or occupation and offers the employer 
an opportunity to assess the individual as a prospective employee at no cost to the employer.  Supports include tuition 
and related costs like tools and equipment ass ociated with occupational education and training programs, 
transportation and childcare, dental care, work -related uniforms and clothing, digital literacy skills, and career 
coaching including guidance on discussing criminal background and long absences fr om the workplace with 
prospective employers.  Staff also work with employers, providing education on the value of a job to individuals in 
recovery and the benefits of providing a second chance - highlighting the success employers have had in employing 
indiv iduals in reentry and recovery.
