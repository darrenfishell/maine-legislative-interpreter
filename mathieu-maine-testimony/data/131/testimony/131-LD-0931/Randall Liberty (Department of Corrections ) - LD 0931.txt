TESTIMONY OF  
 
RANDALL A. LIBERTY, COMMISSIONER  
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  
 
In Opposition to  
 
LD 931 An Act to Expand the State’s Workforce by Supporting the Transition from Incarceration to 
Employment   
 
Before the  
Criminal Justice Public Safety Committee  
May 9, 2023  
 
 
Senator Beebe -Center and Representative Salisbury and other distinguished members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, I am Randall Liberty, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections 
providing testimony in opposition to LD 931.  
 
While we believe the sponsor of this bill has every great intention, the MDOC does not need legislation to work 
with the State Workforce Board or the Maine Department of Labor.  
 
MDOC staff participate  with of the State Workforce  Board  (I myself am an advis ory member) , with regional 
workforce boards, with the various committees that make up the State Workforce Board. Furthermore, MDOC 
is written into the State Workforce Board’s 2022 -2023 Unified State Plan. The  MDOC and the MDOL partner 
on numerous programs and services designed to support the vocational development or current and former  
residents  and individuals  on probation.  
 
The relationship  between MDOC and MDOL is extensive and quite healthy.  
 
The bill, while still in concept draft form, appears to tac kle another, albeit separate  topic. That of 
recommendations  from the workgroup associated with the  passage of LD 1009 from the  130th Legislature.  
 
The MDOC was part of th at workgroup however because the recommendations outlined in the concept draft do 
not directly impact the MDOC we yield to the Maine Sheriffs Association.  
 
We do encourage the committee to take into advisement information pre sented by the Maine Sheriffs 
Association  about the work associated with the passage of LD 1009  and the necessity of the language in this 
section of the bill.  
 
Thank You,  
 
Randall A. Liberty, Commissioner  
Maine Department of Corrections
