Testimony of the  Maine O steopathic Association  
Before the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services  
 
In Reference to:  
LD 1407, An Act to Amend the Maine Insurance Code Regarding Payments by Health Insurance 
Carriers to Providers  
Public Hearing: Monday, April 24, 2023 10:00 AM,Cross Building, Room 220  
 
Senator  Bailey, Representative  Perry and distingu ished members of the Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services , 
 
The Maine Ost eopathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization repres enting appro ximately 40 0 
osteopathic physicians as well as more t han 700 residents and students. Our missio n is to “ serve the Osteopathic 
profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated  effort of professional education, advocacy and member 
services in order to ensure the availability of quality oste opathic health  care to the people of  this State.”  
 
The MOA is pleased  to provide comments in reference to LD 1 407. We are in support of this bill, believing that  
its proposed solutions would help a ddress  growing problem betwee n insurance carriers and Maine’s healthcare 
providers  that we see as p articularly crippling for  smaller practices .  We’ve outlined what some of these issues are 
and why they have such an impact in our testimony for LD1 498, so we will n ot bela bor them here.  
 
We believe the  requests outlined here are fair and reasonable  update s, all of which would be welcomed by our 
members struggling to navigate the complications of getting paid by insurers they hold contracts with : 
-An opportunity to ob ject to contract  changes with a clear time period  and with estimates outlining  potential 
adverse impacts  
-Interest paid on overdue claims  no matter the situa tion 
-Restricting  the windo w of time for retroactive  denials to 24 months  
 
We see LD 1407 as a pathway  to giving Maine’s providers  and he althca re systems  further clarity  in insurer 
contracts , so that they can spend more of thei r time prov iding  quality  healthcare . Agreements wo rk best when 
each party  understands  the rules .We would urge you to vote Ought to P ass on LD 14 07.
