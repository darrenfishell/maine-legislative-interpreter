Carriers to Providers – Letter of Support  
 
Dear Representative MASTRACCIO and Representatives PRINGLE  and ZAGER : 
 
The Maine Psychological Association (MePA) is a membership organization representing psychologists in 
Maine who work in private practice, at Maine’s colle ges and universities, and in the public sector. Our 
mission is to advance psychology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promoting health and 
human welfare.  
 
MePA supports LD 1407: An Act to Amend the Maine Insurance Code Regarding Payments by Health 
Insurance Carriers to Providers. We are in favor of amending the Maine Insurance Code to promote 
timely and accurate payment to providers.   
Thank you for your attention to this matter.  
Sincerely,  
 
 
Jamie Pratt, PsyD  
President
