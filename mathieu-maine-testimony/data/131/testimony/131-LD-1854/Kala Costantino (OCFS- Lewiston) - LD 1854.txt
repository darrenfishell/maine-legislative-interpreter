The immediate implications of the pay gap and how it impacts myself, my colleagues 
and my family directly relate to staff recruitment, staff retention and burnout. 
Currently in our office there are over 20 caseworker openings and there have been at 
least 2 staff members [including caseworkers, case aids, and supervisors] giving 
notice every week for the past 6-8 weeks. This has caused the remaining staff in our 
office to have to carry caseloads that are double the recommendations set forth by 
previous studies and internal reports. The current expectations are not realistic and are
causing extreme burnout for the caseworkers who have not yet resigned. As of right 
now we have been told by higher ups that there are no potential new staff on the 
registrar, meaning that this job is not even sounding appealing to other outside 
individuals also meaning that there is no potential relief in sight for our office. 
Closing the pay gap would potentially entice other licensed social workers in the state
of Maine to apply for positions in our office it would also reflect that there is a level 
of appreciation for caseworkers in the state of Maine who are serving our most 
vulnerable population in this state. It is insulting to do the work that we do, meet the 
demands that are placed on us, work the unrealistic amounts of overtime required to 
meet the deadlines for this job to ensure child safety while barely making more than 
entry level employees/cashiers at Target. This job requires caseworkers to often work 
late in order to see all of our children which means paying extra for childcare that 
falls outside of daycare hours and the current pay does not make that added demand 
feasible. In addition to all of this, the current reimbursement rate for travel is not 
equitable for the amount [mileage, oil changes and wear and tare] that we are required
to travel with our personal vehicles, it is my understanding that the current rate of 46 
cents per mile is also well below the federal reimbursement rate of 65 cents per mile.
