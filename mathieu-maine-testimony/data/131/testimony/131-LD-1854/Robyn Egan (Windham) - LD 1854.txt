Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and members of the State and Local Government Committee, 
My name is Robyn Egan and I reside in Windham, Maine. I am a retired state employee and a member of 
the Maine Service Employees Association. 
I began my career with the Department of Corrections in 1982 and retired after 37 years of dedicated 
service. For 35 years, I worked as a Correctional Caseworker at the Maine Correctional Center. Beinga 
social worker in a correctional facility had a host of challenges and increased caseloads affected my 
ability to provide services. My duties and responsibilities changed but myjob description was not 
altered or updated. 
I am her today to speak in favor of LD 1854, the classification and compensation bill. Prior to my 
retirement in 2019, I was a member of the MSEA bargaining team. We worked hard to raise wages and 
bring employees pay up to a level equal with the private sector. I am sad to say we were not able to 
accomplish this and many workers left state government. I saw a lot of changes at my worksite and in all 
of state service. Staff shortages and large caseloads became the norm as opposed to the exception. The 
staff that remained worked long hours and in many cases felt unappreciated for their service. As their 
workloads increased their pay did not. Vacant positions increased as well as workloads. 
It is time for this to change and that is why I stand here asking you to support LD 1854. It is time that 
state employees are compensated for their hard work and dedication. It is time the state review and 
update the compensation plan, implement a market pay study and provide a comprehensive review of 
the classification plan. 
Thank you for your time and I am available for questions. 
Robyn Egan 
Windham, Maine
