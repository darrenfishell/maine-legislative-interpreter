When I came to the State of Maine I was offered roughly 60% of my pay as it was in the private 
sector and that pay had to be specially approved by the Commissioner of Finance.   The fact the 
salary had to be specifically approved tells me that most folks would start at a salary level even 
lower than what I received.   This gap in pay has made it necessary for me to work additional 
jobs.    I officiate high school sports of all kinds and although I enjoy th e work, I have to do this in 
order to help bridge this pay differential.   If I wasn't officiating, I would need to take on a part -
time weekend/evenings job to help with living expenses. I spend very little time at home with my 
family as a result of this ne ed.   Regarding the Division of Audit within DHHS, we have had no 
less than 4 open positions in my department since I started there in 2021 and have over 10 
positions, we could fill across the entire Division.    This lack of staff has increased my required  
output with no requisite increase in pay nor are we allowed to work overtime.    We continue to 
lose staff to retirement or promotion out of the Division.   There is increased stress due to the 
staffing shortage.   How do we attract quality talent when we of fer sub -par compensation?
