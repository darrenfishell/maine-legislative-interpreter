Maine Service Employees Associa�on, SEIU Local 1989  
In Support of LD 1854, An Act to Complete and Implement the Comprehensive Review of the 
Classiﬁca�on and Compensa�on System for Execu�ve Branch Employees, sponsored by Representa�ve 
Drew Ga�ne.  
Before the Joint Standing Commitee on State and Local Government,  
Friday, May 12, 2023, Cross Oﬃce Building Room 214 and Electronically  
Senator Nangle, Representa�ve Stover, members of the Commitee on State and Local Government, I’m 
Dean Staﬃeri, President of the Maine Service Employees Associa�on, Loc al 1989 of the Service 
Employees Interna�onal Union. My union represents over 13,000 workers, including workers in the Execu�ve Branch of Maine State Government. It’s an employer I know well, having worked in the 
Execu�ve Branch for 32 years, currently as a rehabilita�on counselor for the Maine Department of Labor 
and before that as a caseworker supervisor for the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. We’re here today in support of LD 1854, An Act to Complete and Implement the Comprehensive Rev iew 
of the Classiﬁca�on and Compensa�on System for Execu�ve Branch Employees, sponsored by 
Representa�ve Drew Ga�ne.  
I’d like to start by reminding you of the remarks of Governor Mills at a news conference on January 10, 
2023, about the upcoming sta te budget. Governor Mills said, “We must invest in the infrastructure that 
supports our greatest asset, which is our people.” We wholeheartedly agree on the need for this kind of investment in people – and they include the State of Maine workers who are de dica�ng their careers to 
public service despite being substan�ally underpaid for their work for all or most of their careers.  
While you are hearing today directly from many state workers in this room and via Zoom, and from 
others through their writen te s�mony, many other state workers shared with their stories with me 
about how the state employee pay gap has ﬁnancially impacted them, their families and the services  
they provide. Many of their stories are harrowing. One state worker told of losing an a partment and 
becoming homeless for a while. Others spoke of being unable to make ends meet or aﬀord childcare or 
healthcare. Many cannot aﬀord a vaca�on or the cost of sending a child to summer camp. Many have 
had to apply for state aid to feed their fa milies. I’d like to share some of their stories, in their own words:  
 
“I need to work a second job nights to support my family. This results in me working 70+ hour 
workweeks, and less �me with my family. If the pay gap were closed and a more livable wage oﬀered to 
employees, I wouldn’t need to have a second job and could have less stress, more work life balance and, 
most important, �me with my kids.”  
-- A worker for Maine DHHS  
“I have been at MaineDOT for more than 20 years. Living oﬀ state pay is chall enging when the cost of 
living has gone up a lot. Please ﬁx the pay gap. My understanding is our pay needs to be increased by 
$5.00 extra an hour. If MaineDOT wants to hire more people instead of losing them, this needs to be 
ﬁxed. We are supposed to be represen�ng the state and the pay is not.”  
-- A worker for MaineDOT

 “While the work of public service is rewarding, the disparity in pay also makes it also feel like a sacriﬁce. I 
have advanced degrees which are more highly compensated outside of state s ervice. With inﬂa�on and 
rising costs, I feel I have to make a choice between public service or suppor�ng my family. I feel I have no 
choice but to explore a more sustainable career paths for my family.”  
-- A worker for  the Maine Bureau of Rehabilita�o n Services within the Maine Department of Labor  
 
“The pay gap is the reason I'm looking to leave state employment.  As a single parent, I can't aﬀord to 
pay for the necessi�es and have had to get state aid for food.  My kids as part -�me workers are maki ng 
$15.00-plus and hour and have been oﬀered $18.00 to go to full �me at McDonalds.  Yet many in my 
group don't make that.  How is this ok with our Legislature?”  
-- A worker for the General Government Service Center the Maine Department of Administra�ve  and 
Financial Services  
 
“With my experience and creden�als (macro -social worker), I could go to the private sector for almost 
$20,000 raise or go federal government and work en�rely remote for almost double my salary. I enjoy 
what I do so much that I le � this job at one point for a new opportunity and came back. But I have a 
family of 5 kids and 4 of them in daycare. We make JUST a hair too much for childcare assistance but not 
enough to aﬀord childcare anywhere that doesn’t provide a scholarship. We h ave contemplated many 
�mes as a family of me taking a new job to meet my earning poten�al but we can’t argue the beneﬁt of 
staying in a job I love and am passionate about and some of the other perks of being a state employee. 
However, making just above the poverty level is a terrible cliﬀ to be on. It’s very hard to navigate the 
never ending balance of not making enough to thrive and making too much to get even just childcare 
assistance alone would be a huge help with 4 in childcare.”  
-- A Maine worker  for Maine DHHS  
 
“I'm a TCL in Region 5. I run a 5 –6-person crew in the winter months. This is my opinion. We have been 
running short for the last 2 years, when we do get staﬀed, another leaves. These are hardworking 
dedicated employees that can't make a l iving with us. They ﬁnd another job for $4 - $5 more per hour, 
even if it's more �me away from their family. This impacts our customers, the traveling public. We can 
see snow from late October through early May, high windstorms, freezing rain and sleet. Losing these 
employees who we have invested in and trained to maintain our roadways is impac�ng our customers 
and their families.  I have spoken personally with exi�ng employees and they truly like their job but have 
to look elsewhere to support their fa milies. Something needs to be done to retain our people, my 
opinion, close the pay gap and increase staﬃng numbers.”  
-- A worker for MaineDOT  
 
“I am a single parent and I do not qualify for any services to help with food, fuel, etc.  I make too much 
for things like that but I am barely making enough for a decent apartment, along with daycare, food, 
clothing, etc.  My child has special dietary needs and those are expensive.  Closing the pay gap would 
help ease the burden on things like this.”

“I love my job - everyday I get to serve Maine people out in their communi�es. But loving my job doesn't 
pay the bills. A�er 4.5 years working for the state, I've started looking for other jobs b ecause the pay gap 
between what I make working for the state of Maine versus what I could be making working for either a 
private employer or the federal government is just too big. With inﬂa�on and skyrocke�ng housing costs, 
my salary isn't going as far  as it used to. And I'm not the only one --  my team within Maine CDC had 
seven employees a year ago...now we are down to two. The pay gap is cri�cally impac�ng the essen�al 
services available to Mainers. Please respect Maine state workers and all people  of Maine by paying 
state workers what we're worth and closing the pay gap! With increased gas prices and skyrocke�ng 
costs associated with car maintenance and repairs, the current mileage reimbursement for state 
employees is insul�ng. Raise the mileage reimbursement rate to AT LEAST the federal rate!”  
-- Another worker for the Maine CDC within Maine DHHS  
 
“The pay gap between what we make now and what we should make as mechanics is horrible and needs 
to be corrected or you will con�nue to lose employees  for that reason. I work 40 hours a week and my 
wife work as a Ed Tech 3 and we don't make it most of the �me with our two incomes. Most of the �me 
we have to juggle stuﬀ around to make it. We also provide for a family or 9. The only thing that keeps me  
here is the beneﬁts for our children. The pay is not keeping me here and its sad that I have to feel this 
way.”  
-- A worker for MaineDOT  
 
“I really enjoy my job, but I feel like at some point I will be forced to leave a posi�on that I have worked 
for al most 6 years in order to meet my families’ needs. I would rather be compensa�on accordingly so I 
can con�nue to serve the State of Maine and stay where I am passionate rather than leave for reasons 
beyond happiness.”  
-- A worker for Maine DHHS  
 
“During the COVID pandemic, my family’s expenses soared with no school, extra child care costs, extra 
food expenses, just about everything cost extra. While barely making ends meet prior to the pandemic 
was a real thing as a State of Maine employee of over  5 years at that �me, the pandemic caused that 
already -strapped budget to implode. Daily expenses started being charged to high interest rate cards just 
to ensure that basic needs were met. The low wages we are paid caused my family to eventually lose our  
apartment and to become homeless for a period of �me. The housing market in Maine has blown up 
along with all other expenses and the average cost of rents in my area has gone up by almost 50% in the 
last couple of years. While we have seen small progress  in wage increases in the last couple of years, the 
2 to 4% we have received does nothing to compare to the increases to the cost of living is in this state. 
Couple that with increases to our insurance premiums, higher deduc�bles, and less medical/dental and 
vision coverage available and how is anyone supposed to survive, yet alone try to save for our 
re�rements? Our family has had to delay and some�mes permanently postpone medical/dental/vision 
4 
 visits and treatment plans due to not being able to aﬀord the addi�onal hardship that these bills place 
on our family. My teenage son started a job at Walmart and started at $17.00 per hour which is more 
than someone star�ng for the State of Maine at an entry level posi�on would make. When is enough 
going to b e enough? It makes it tough to provide the dedicated services and quality support to the 
residents of the State of Maine when we employees have so much stress in our personal lives associated 
with worrying about where our children's next meal will come fro m or how we are going to manage to 
keep the lights on this month. Since becoming a one -income household, I have had to maintain an 
addi�onal part -�me job over the last 5 years just to be able to keep our en�re budget from falling apart.”  
-- A worker for  Maine Revenue Services  
 
“I s�ll qualify for state OFI services, I u�lize a food bank to help feed my family. I go hungry o�en to try to 
stretch the food we have to allow my family to eat. I have a car that’s slowly falling apart and we are 
unable to ﬁ x it o�en, due to the expense. My husband takes �me out of work to do repairs as it’s too 
expensive to have a garage do the repairs. We grow and raise some of our own food and are working on 
improving our barn to allow us to raise more food. It’s exhaus� ng and depressing just trying to meet our 
basic needs. We pay a lot of money for health and vision insurance that isn’t accepted and bills aren’t 
paid, leaving us with unpaid medical bills that we have to pay out of pocket. I love my job but as the cost 
of living con�nues to grow out of control, I’m considering having to get a second job, which I know most 
state workers have to do. It’s not fair how hard we work to have to get a second job just to be able to eat 
or keep a roof over your families head.”

“I've worked in the same posi�on - a very technical posi�on managing very large projects and working 
with mul�ple state and federal agencies with direct impact on human health and environmental 
protec�on -  at the State of Maine since 1995 - and I s�ll live paycheck to paycheck. Note that I have very 
litle debt, no car payments and no outstanding mortgage or rent. Just your basic u�li�es, groceries, 
gasoline, some vet bills. I buy my clothes at Goodwill. No extravagant travel,  vaca�ons or hobbies. My 
savings account balance is the minimum of $5 as I CANNOT SAVE MONEY ON MY STATE SALARY!  In 
terms of other employers, in January 2023 the State of Massachusets adver�sed an open ing for a 
posi�on doing exactly what I do now (manage hazardous waste cleanup at Dept. of Defense facili�es) 
with a *star�ng* salary that is over $15,000 more than what I make a�er 28 years in my current posi�on.  
I'm unable to move to Massachusets b ut I have considered asking if I could do that job remotely or 
mostly remotely.  This would mean the State of Maine would lose my 28 years of ins�tu�onal knowledge 
(the only other staﬀ in my unit who do what I do, with experience working with Dept. of D efense, have 
less than two years’ experience *combined*) as well as all the connec�ons I have made over the past 10 
years working with staﬀ from other states and senior staﬀ from the US Oﬃce of Secretary of Defense on 
na�onal commitees and work grou ps.  The idea of leaving the State of Maine causes me great anxiety 
but as I approach re�rement in less than 10 years I simply can't aﬀord to live on my state salary 
anymore.”

“The pay ga p impacts me such that I am not able to aﬀord to live in the same city where I work without a 
roommate. The state employee pay has not matched the rising cost of living in Portland for as long as I 
have worked with the state. If I did not live with my par tner, I would not be able to aﬀord to live in 
Portland. I do not have a car, so living outside of Portland is not feasible for me. Even with the shared 
rent, I am paying signiﬁcantly less than half while my partner picks up the slack. I work full �me in  a skill 
and knowledge based posi�on at the upper end of the posi�on's pay scale, yet am not paid enough to 
even rent an apartment on my own. I have seen signs for entry level and "unskilled" posi�ons in the 
private sector for as much as or more than wh at I am making. As a millennial, I do not have the luxury of 
the genera�onal wealth that the genera�ons before me enjoy - I do not have a re�rement account as I 
had never had enough money le� over a�er living expenses to contribute to one, I will likely never be 
able to purchase my own home, and I certainly would not be able to support children on my salary. The 
services that Maine employees provide to the people of Maine is worth so much more than the pennies 
that we receive in return.”  
-- A worker  for the Oﬃce of Family Independence within Maine DHHS  
 
“I am paying $16,900 annually in childcare as a single parent and $27,000 in rent, which together is just 
about 70% of my income. Daycares are s�ll shu�ng down with posi�ve Covid cases, and parents are s�ll 
responsible to pay. Without having any Covid protec�ons or fronted sick �me, plus the extreme cost of 
childcare, with wages that are not rising with inﬂa�on, it's almost not worth it to work. Since January, 
I've received a daycare increase, rent increase, car insurance increase, and electricity increase, but no 
wage increase and that is making it almost impossible to pay basic living expenses. It makes employees 
biter and resen�ul, when private sector jobs are paying so much more. At the ve ry least, wages need to 
increase with the cost of living annually, not even addressing how underpaid State employees are - this is 
a bare minimum. Employees will be forced to leave if something isn't done soon because it's just not 
feasible to exist on Sta te wages. Please consider paying livable wages.”  
--A worker for the Maine Department of Administra�ve and Financial Services  
 
“I work in Augusta, and comparable jobs to the one I have right now in places like Gardiner pay $30,000 
more a year. That's almos t twice as much as I currently make. And it would be doing the same thing 
(working in a chemistry lab). As a 38 -year -old in a two -income household, I am living paycheck to 
paycheck. I have no savings. I don't go to the doctor if I can absolutely avoid it. Despite having insurance, 
going to the den�st, the eye doctor - I forego these things to pay my mortgage. As employees we give so 
much of ourselves, working past our hours with no compensa�on because we don't get over�me yet are 
s�ll required to meet o ur deadlines. It isn't fair that we give you work for free when what we are being 
paid is paltry in comparison to other places. Please help us so we can con�nue to work.”

 “I am a single woman who works in southern Maine, which  means the pay gap impacts me signiﬁcantly 
as our ci�es grow, work norms change, and housing (and everything) becomes even more expensive. I 
grew up in Maine, have happily worked in Child Welfare for seven years, but am worried I may actually 
need to lea ve Maine soon to do this work elsewhere. I have done the research and despite cost of living 
increasing everywhere, Southern Maine is the least aﬀordable place for me to live in New England 
explicitly because of the wage gap. Even though I have been fruga l and conserva�ve with my life 
decisions and money (in state tui�on, no travel as a young adult, living with roommates) and I have 
promoted into a respectable job with lots of responsibility, I am s�ll almost 30 and cannot imagine a 
world where I do not  have to worry about my housing situa�on and cannot fathom having even the 
slightest chance of saving for a home. It may not be the state’s responsibility to pay us what we need to 
survive in this economy as it changes, but it seems like it is AT LEAST th e state's responsibility to pay us 
what other social workers in similar states doing similar work are paid.  A few years ago, when my car 
broke down (because I put so many miles on it from being a child welfare caseworker), I had JUST 
enough money to buy a  new one. I made JUST enough money to make the car payments. And of course, 
my new car racked up 65k miles in the ﬁrst year, so I can just forget about keeping it long a�er the car 
loan is paid oﬀ. There is no room in my life ﬁnancially for even emerge ncies. There is no room in my life 
ﬁnancially for normal things like a reasonable annual vaca�on. My life is whizzing by and I am wondering 
if I made a grave mistake working for the State of Maine. It seemed like a responsible thing to do years 
ago. Ther e is a lot to unpack here. But, lets’ start with the fact that our wages seem to trail behind the 
outside world's wages by years. When I ﬁrst started this job in 2017, I barely took home 2k a month. I 
have been behind ever since despite spending over four  years of my life working an average of 15 hours 
a week over�me (with litle sleep and lots of stress). Being promoted actually meant I would make less 
every month. Why are social services supervisor's wages not reﬂec�ng the increase in exper�se and 
responsibility that comes with that? I spent ﬁve years not able to make it to scheduled appointments 
because of this job’s demands, not able to aﬀord my medical bills. Because I have spent so many years 
just scraping by, I am now almost thirty with almost no savings. Again, I have been careful.  But, I do not 
have a spouse, I do not have inheritance. But, I shouldn't have to. Because I have dedicated work and 
exper�se to show for it, and wish to be paid accordingly. I understand that the humans behind the work 
are always the least important part of the budget, but despite loving the work I do, I am also here to 
earn a living. I would like to stay, but I won't be able to make it work much longer.”  
-- A worker for Maine DHHS  
 
It’s past �me for ac�on to close the pay gap. Fortunately there is a solu�on to begin doing so. Please  
support LD 1854. As you consider this legisla�on, please take to heart the Governor’s words from Jan. 
10: “Our greatest asset….is our people.”  
Thank yo u and I would be glad to answer any ques�ons.
