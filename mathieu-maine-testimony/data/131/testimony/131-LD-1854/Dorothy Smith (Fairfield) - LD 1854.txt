My name is Dorothy Smith, I live in Fairfield, and Iâ€™m writing on my own time in support 
of LD 1854. I am an eligibility specialist in the Skowhegan office. When I started there in 
May 2017, we had a full office. That is no longer the case. We are pretty much at half 
capacity. That means more work for everyone, including the supervisors. We keep 
getting a sked to add more duties to our work, such as requesting SAVE for non -citizens, 
importing documents into DocuWare, etc. When we do hire new people, we wonder if 
they are going to stay or go somewhere else. The training takes way too long. It was 5 
months wh en I started. Now it's 1 year. By the time people got out of training and have 
to do the real work, they don't want to do it anymore. What a waste of time and money! 
A better selection process of potential employees and a better training schedule is 
needed . I am a widow and my children are grown, so the only impact is on me. The 
more work that's added on equals more stress.  
 
Another point I forgot to bring up us this. I reached the top of my paygrade a year ago & 
I plan to work 2 more years. So, no merit pa y raises for me for 3 years! Is that FAIR? 
NO! I am an excellent worker & deserve to be rewarded for it.  Please pass and fund LD 
1854.
