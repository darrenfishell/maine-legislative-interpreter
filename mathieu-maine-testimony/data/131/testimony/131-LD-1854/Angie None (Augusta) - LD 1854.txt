My co-worker's son in lawjust got hired at Olive Garden as a dishwasher. Starting pay? $18 an hour. The 
hiring signs outside of fast-food restaurants, where most of its employees are teenagers, are advertising 
a starting pay of $15 or $16 dollars per hour. I started working for the state of Maine when I was 25 
years old. This April, it will be 18 years that I have been with the Office of Child and Family Services. 
Most of my adult life has been dedicated to state service and dedicated to our state's most vulnerable 
population. I am the only accounting associate in the Augusta office where we haveover 300 children in 
state custody just in my office alone. My responsibilities are processing payments for several types of 
providers, including medical providers, mental health providers, drug and alcohol testing sites, paternity 
testing labs, childcare providers, newspapers when we have to publish for an unknown parent, foster 
parents and kinship families. I process the mileage reimbursements for foster parents who transport 
children in care to visits with their parents, to doctor appointments, to counseling appointments, to 
schooland to daycare. I process the reimbursements when foster parents pay out of pocket for things 
children in care need. I can't even guess the number of payments that I process in any given month, but 
I can promise that this number is in the high thousands. What do you think I make per hour? What do 
you think a career with my listed responsibilities should be making per hour? Remember, the Olive 
Garden dish washer is starting his first day on the job making $18 per hour. After almost 2 decades in 
state service, I make 20 dollars and 73 cents per hour. I get longevity pay for being with the state for so 
long. You know how much that is? $24 per pay period. $12 per week. Our case aides who are 
responsible for supervising visits between bio parents and children in state custody, sometimes putting 
themselves in very dangerous positions when there are volatile parents who may be under the influence 
of drugs or alcohol, start at $15.75. 
I really could end my little speech right here as I feel that what I have already stated should be 
enough for you to re—think how you compensate your state of Maine employees and how we are being 
taken advantage of us because state service is so important to us that we stick around. We show up day 
in and day out because the people of Maine need us to. It makes me sick to see all the pats on the back 
that the Governor is receiving for another state surplus when that state surplus is a direct result of 
underpaying the very workers who show up every day to keep the state running and functioning. 
There are not many who can live on $20 an hour in 2023. I am a single mother and after 18 
years with the state, I still do not make livable wages. 40 hours per week at $20.73 is $829.20 per week. 
This is before taxes and health insurance premiums are taken out. I bring home $1100 every two weeks 
or $550 per week. A single person wouldn't be able to live on that, let alone a parent of any number of 
children. lam 43 years old and live with my mother because without her, my children and I wouid be 
homeless. I can barely afford to feed my children, let alone afford to give them any life experiences like 
bringing them out of state. A few years ago, we did get a 2% raise and then a 4% raise which still left us 
well below adequate compensation for the workloads that we carry. At the same time, they raised out 
health insurance premiums, so we never really saw that raise at all. Over the past year, when inflation 
became out of control, all other employers were raising their employees ’ wages to keep up with rising 
costs of everything, our already pathetic wages stayed the same. If I wasn't so close to my 25 years, I’ 
would absolutely be job hunting. Why take on the stress of a job with the number of responsibilities I 
mentioned and the workload that I carry for wages that I can't even live on, when I can go wash dishes
for a few dollars less and not have the stress and workload that comes with my position. This is the 
reason turnover is so high. This is the reason that we can't hire or retain quality workers because they 
can make more money elsewhere with much less stress and responsibilities. I for one am tired of seeing 
DHHS in the news with accusatory stories about how we are not doing enough to keep Maine children 
safe. Its pretty hard to keep Maine children safe when we don’t have enough staff to do so because the 
pay does not correlate with the stress and responsibilities of working in OCFS. People are leaving the 
state because they cannot make money enough to survive. But people looking for handouts are 
welcome with open arms. The ones who have been here their whole lives, working since they were 16 
years old, like I have, are working to provide services to ones who don’t work but are more than capable 
of doing so. They receive free food, free healthcare, free housing. They are able to afford the latest 
iphones somehow. What about the ones who work their butts every single day who receive a paycheck 
that doesn't even cover their bills, let alone be able to afford to go out and enjoy life. 
It's extremely embarrassing when my co-workers see what l do every day for my office, and they 
know what my pay grade is. lt’s embarrassing that I have allowed myself to be taken advantage of for so 
long. But I have stayed because state service is important to me. However, it's not me who should be 
embarrassed. lt's the powers that be that think $20.73/hour is an acceptable wage for someone who 
must make sure that our state's children receive these imperative sen/ices by assuring that these 
providers are paid in a timely manner. The ones who should be embarrassed and ashamed are the 
members of the current administration who have refused to meet with our union members to bring 
Maine state employees in line with the same positions in other states who make way more than we 
make for providing the same services. Can you imagine the quality workers that we could have if we 
were paid livable wages? ~have to constantly train new 
employees just f r them to leave when they get a much better paying job in a month or two.

last paycheck of 2022, I made under well under $42,000. Considering that the cost of living in Maine is

would be nice to feel that she actually means what she says. But when our pay does not reflect her 
gratitude, those words mean nothing and I honestly would rather her not send those emails as they only 
disgust me more. Please do the right thing.'
