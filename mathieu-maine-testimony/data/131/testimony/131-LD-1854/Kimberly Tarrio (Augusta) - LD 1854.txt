Testimony in support of LD 1854  
I have three children that I support. Making the money I make now I live in constant 
debt. There is never any extra and we are constantly pulling money from something to 
catch something else up. I do not have any type of state or federal assistance. With the 
rise in heating oil, groceries and nearly everything else in our lives living is getting really 
hard. We want to work hard and be proud to support our fam ilies on our own but it is a 
scary world out there. It is discouraging to never be able to get ahead.
