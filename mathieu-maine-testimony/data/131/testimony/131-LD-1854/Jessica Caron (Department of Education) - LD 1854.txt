Please continue to work to fund our state employees! I absolutely love my job and am
so proud to represent the state and support the children of Maine in my role. As a 
young woman in my 30s, I grew up in Maine and want to start a family here. The only
piece that gives me pause is the pay here in Maine compared to the benefits and pay I 
can receive elsewhere.
In my particular state branch, I find the workloads do not match the pay and know 
that a similar role in another neighboring state would mean more financial stability. 
Please check out the work classification study that digs more deeply into this issue: 
bit.ly/2020MarketStudyReport. 
It sometimes feels like Maine does not prioritize attracting employees for the long 
term by working to redesign systems around current employee needs and remove 
systemic barriers to enable workers to build a balanced family life. In general, I feel 
torn between the mission and purpose of my current role and the financial stability 
and work-life balance I could achieve in a different organization/ state. Two working 
parents are essential to make ends meet these days.
At the top of my mind is my growing concerned that the state pay scale has not and 
will not keep up with the rising costs of housing and inflation. Please consider 
investing in state employees and fighting against the years of cuts and wage 
stagnation to ensure that it is financially viable and accessible for a working woman 
to raise a family without fear of instability in the back of her mind. Thank you for 
listening and please continue to invest in our public institutions!
