LD 1854
To whom it may concern,
I am writing to you in strong support of LD 1854. As a 7 year state employee working
for the Department of Environmental Protection, I've seen many folks come and go, 
including within my own work unit. We recently lost a valuable Planning and 
Research Assistant, who was working at around $18 per hour. To put this in 
perspective, this person is a recent graduate who was a duel major in two STEM 
subjects. Meanwhile, in Portland ME we have McDonald's workers that are starting at
around $16 per hour. Even when comparing apples to apples, the average pay gap 
between state workers and their private sector counterparts is 15%! For some, that 
15% is the difference between having to decide between paying off student loans, 
their credit card debt, or paying for the groceries. While working for state government
gives many of us a sense of purpose and fulfillment, working on behalf of the people 
of Maine shouldn't come with a deep financial cost. As someone with a background in
Economics, if you don't provide a wage commensurate with talent and experience, 
then talent will continue to leave state government for the private sector, including in 
other states. Think of closing the wage gap as an investment in ALL Maine workers, 
and remind us that hard work and talent should be rewarded. Invest in the future of all
Mainers! 
Sincerely,
Robert Leighton
