Testimony in support of LD 1854, An Act to Complete and Implement the Comprehensive 
Review of the Classification and Compensation System for Executive Branch Employees 
 
 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, members of the Committee on State and Local 
Government, 
 
I am writing to you today on behalf of myself as a private citizen in Augusta. I appreciate your 
committees for taking the time to consider this testimony. I work as a Title 1 Coordinator for the 
Maine Department of Education. As you know, it is of critical importance that the Maine DOE 
has the staff and resources necessary to support the varied districts and learners in our state.  
 
It is clear to see that our decentralized school system in the US relies heavily on the capacity 
and initiatives that come from the state level. With departments that provide professional 
development, grant funding, attention and resources to underserved students, partnerships with 
communities, and guidance on law and instructional best practices, the Maine DOE deserves to 
be funded in a way that enables a strong statewide education system.  
 
Please consider the immense impact a strong, resourced, and staffed Maine DOE would have 
on the districts, schools, educators, families, and students in this state. I urge legislators to 
continue to invest in our learning systems that begin and end with the health and wellbeing of 
the Maine Department of Education. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to read my testimony. 
 
Rita Pello
