Testimony in support of LD 1854, An Act to Complete and Implement the Comprehensive 
Review of the Classification and Compensation System for Executive Branch Employees 
 
Arthur Phillips, Maine Center for Economic Policy  
May 12, 2023  
 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Committee on State and Local 
Government, my name is Arthur Phillips, and I am an analyst at the Maine Center for Economic 
Policy. I submit this testimony in support of LD 1854, an act that would help Maine properly value our 
essential public servants. 
In November 2020, the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services (DAFS) 
published a study comparing the earnings of public and private sector workers across New England 
and found Maine State workers are paid 15 percent below the market average. Compared to only 
their public sector counterparts, Maine’s workers are paid 11 percent below the average. Put another 
way, at the time of that report, Maine’s Executive Branch employees would have had to work nearly 
six weeks longer to earn as much as public servants elsewhere in New England.i 
These findings followed a longer history of State employees being underpaid, dating back to at least 
2008. In 2009, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services engaged a consulting group 
to conduct a survey comparing state employees’ compensation to their counterparts in Maine’s 
private and private sector. That report found Executive Branch workers were paid between 7.5 and 
21.7 percent less than in the private sector.ii In each of the intervening years between 2009 and 
2019, workers received no or modest wage increases with an overall raise of 10.4 percent for the 
decade. During the same period, the overall rate of inflation was 18 percent, meaning workers’ real 
wages shrank. Over the decade, Maine’s inflation-adjusted GDP grew by 10.8 percent while State 
workers’ purchasing power declined.iii  
In 2021, State workers ratified a contract that was a first step towards making up for over a decade 
of lost ground. Since then, however, the cost of living increased more than at any other time in the 
previous four decades, leaving our public servants even further behind. Private sector workers have 
been able to negotiate decent raises as employers compete for employees in a tight labor market 
and a booming economy. Our public sector workers saw a four percent raise in 2022, while Maine 
workers overall saw their wages increase by an average of 8.6 percent last year, meaning the wage 
gap only continued to grow. At a time of significant budget surpluses, if we expect to deliver the 
kinds of high-quality public services our residents need and deserve, we must do more to properly 
value our public servants. 
Given the history of undervaluing public sector workers, our historic budget surpluses, and the 
effects of a very competitive labor market, we urge you to support LD 1854.
