If 
Senator Eﬁangle, Representative Stover and members of the State and Local Government 
Committee. My name is Morgan Dunton and I work for the Maine Department of Education. I 
am speaking in support of LD 1854. 
When I was hired nearly two decades ago, i applied in the third round of the position search. It 
was not unusual for DOE to have to advertise and interview multiple times to ﬁnd the right 
person. This is because many positions at DOE require a very extensive and deep knowledge of 
speciﬁc areas and topics. Expert level knowledge and skill proved to be a lifeline in 2020.I 
showed up for teachers across the state and designed the support and resources necessary to 
keep going through the many unusual challenges thrust at them in that awful time. 
Furthermore, because I had been in my position for a long time and proved my expertise to 
many of our stakeholders, I provided calm in the storm, a familiar voice telling teachers that we 
could do anything that was asked of us and that I would be right there with them. 
Relationships are important and keeping Maine workers in our agencies is key to building those 
relationships and sustaining conﬁdence in our state agencies. Unfortunately, we have 
experienced a great "smoosh" of work heaped onto truly expert and dedicated workers who 
cannot sustain the ever-increasing workload, especially without increasing compensation. We 
show up, we agonize over the sacriﬁces we must make to get the work done, and we get the 
work done so we don't let our friends, neighbors, and communities down. 
Supporting the comprehensive review of the classiﬁcation and compensation system isn't just 
necessary; it is an act of respect. Acknowledging the changing nature of work and honoring the 
humane capacity of each individual will keep our dedicated workforce serving Maine in each of 
our agencies. 
Thank you.
