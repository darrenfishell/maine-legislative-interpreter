Members of the Committee on State & Local Government, my name is Zach Wanberg, I live in 
Gardiner, and I work for the Bureau of Insurance  at PFR. Iâ€™m writing on my own time in support 
of LD 1854.  Personally , I feel like the state does a fantastic job with providing employees with 
benefits and livable salaries. However, these metrics are simply outdated. I believe the state 
cares about employee retention but with salaries severely lacking in terms of what other states 
pay their employees and inflation paired with cost of living in 2023...it's time to make a change. 
When employees are compensated based on merit, ability and comparable worth, it's a great 
sight. The respect alone from receiving pay increases shows a level of commitment by our 
superiors & legislators that can even transcend the workplace. I believe, to keep workers from 
leaving the state, morale and producti vity to remain high, substantial wage increases are in 
order.  Please pass and fund LD 1854 to close the pay gap.
