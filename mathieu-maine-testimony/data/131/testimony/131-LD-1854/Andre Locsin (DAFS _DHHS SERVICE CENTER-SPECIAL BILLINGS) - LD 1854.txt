DAFS /DHHS SERVICE CENTER-SPECIAL BILLINGS
LD 1854
Good morning, my name is Andre K. Locsin. I am a Clerk IV working in the 
DAFS/DHHS Service Center.  The State needs to follow through on its commitments 
regarding reclassification.   Many hours were spent to complete the survey and it 
would be a huge waste not to see it through.
I want to be able to hire staff with the skills we need to do the job. It is becoming 
much harder to hire staff because the starting rate is so low. I have gone 9 months 
without a key staff on my team. AP has gone a few years without key staff, currently 
we have 7 vacancies, including one manager.
Staff are finding it harder to put food on the table, pay for childcare and find 
affordable housing.   The volatility of inflation exacerbates all of these challenges.  
What kind of workforce will exist if nothing happens? If State Government can't 
serve its own, how can the State serve its citizens?
