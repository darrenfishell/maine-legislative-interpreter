RE: LD 739 “Resolution, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to 
Empower the Legislature to Allow the Expungement or Sealing of Certain Criminal 
Records. ” 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Committee on 
Judiciary: 
MACDL supports LD 739. 
This committee authorized the creation of the Criminal Records Review Committee in 
2021 and reauthorized its continued work again in 2022. The Criminal Records Review 
Committee, which is before this committee for re—establishment this session, brought 
together a number of stakeholders across the criminal justice system to discuss all aspects 
of criminal records. 
The committee regularly discussed the question of sealing and/or expungement of records 
with many stakeholders reaching a consensus that Maine should join the majority of states 
that allow for expungement and/or sealing of a carefully limited list of crimes. The issue 
of implementing such a system, however, routinely ran into questions about the impact of 
Stale v. Hunter, 447 A.2d 797 (Me. 1982) (interpreting Maine’s separation of powers 
strictly for purposes of resentencing law). Some members (not all) considered Huntera 
bar to the Legislature ’s authority to pass any laws allowing for sealing or expungement in 
light of the Governor ’s perceived sole power in this area. 
Notwithstanding concerns around Stare v. Hunter, the Legislature passed Title 15, Chapter 
310-A, which permits sealing of Class E convictions for persons ages 18-28. Chapter 310- 
A was a great first step to finally move Maine into the majority of states (45 in all) that 
have some form of sealing or expungement. Many Mainers, however, are not able to take 
advantage of Chapter 310-A, which leaves out Class D misdemeanor crimes as well as 
non-violent felonies (e. g., drug possession or theft of greater than $500). Sealing, 
furthermore, has limits to its effectiveness and often requires those people who have 
worked hard to correct their past to possibly lie about a sealed record when a truly 
expunged record would not exist whatsoever. 
LD 739 empowers the Legislature to make important policy considerations that are fair for 
all Mainers as opposed to leaving questions of pardons to a board appointed by the 
Governor. The majority of states currently have laws allowing for sealing or expungement 
of limited felonies (e. g., drug offenses) and the majority of misdemeanors. “50—State 
Comparison: Expungement, Sealing & Other Relief,” The Restoration of Rights Project, 
https://ccresourcecenter.org/state-restoration-profiles/50-state-comparisonjudicial — 
expungement-sealing-and-set-aside-2/ (last accessed April 24, 2023). Some of the very 
bills pending this session seek to move Maine forward with these other states by allowing 
for expungement of certain non-violent felonies (LD 848 & 1550). LD 739 will clear the 
way once and for all for these and other bills seeking to give l\/Iainers a second chance.
