 Testimony of  Maine Press Association  Honorable Anne Carney, Senate Chair  Honorable Matt Moonen, House Chair   Joint Legislative Committee on Judiciary  April 26, 2023  RE: LD 739, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of  Maine to Empower the Legislature to Allow the Expungement or Sealing of  Certain Criminal RecordsDear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of  the Committee on Judiciary The Maine Press Association opposes the legislation on the concern that it is too broadly written, and leaves the door open to wide interpretation.  Instead, we encourage the Joint Committee on Judiciary to direct this proposed resolution to the Criminal Records Review Committee, should that committee be revived through LD 1622 (which the MPA supports), or send it to the Right to Know Advisory Committee for consideration. Maine rules regarding public access to criminal records and processes are complex and affect many citizens in different ways. Possible ramifications of  LD 739 deserve slow and deliberate analysis before setting it into statute. Thank you for your time and consideration,  Maine Press Association Legislative Committee: Lynda Clancy, Editorial Director, Penobscot Bay Pilot Joe Charpentier, Lewiston Sun Journal David Dahl, Editor, Maine Monitor Jodi Jalbert, Publisher, Sun Media Group Dan MacLeod, Managing Editor, Bangor Daily News Judith Meyer, Executive Editor, Sun Journal, Kennebec Journal, Morning Sentinel  Marian McCue, Editor, Portland Phoenix Courtney Spencer, VP of  Advertising, Portland Press Herald Maia Zewert, Editor, Lincoln County News
