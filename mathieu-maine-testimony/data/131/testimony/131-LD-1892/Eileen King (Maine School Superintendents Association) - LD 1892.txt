TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1892  
 
AN ACT TO MAKE STUDE NT TRANSFER AGREEMENTS RENEW  
AUTOMATICALLY EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMST ANCES  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultur-
al Affairs Committee. I am Eileen King, executive director of the Maine School Su-
perintendents Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the 
Maine School Superintendents Association in opposition to L.D. 1892.  
 
Superintendent agreements occur when two superintendents approve the transfer of a 
student from one school administrative unit to another school administrative unit 
(public unit to public unit only). Two conditions must first exist before such an ap-
proval can be arranged:  
 
1. Both superintendents find that a transfer is in a student ’s best interest; and  
2. The student ’s parent/guardian  must approve, except where the student is consid-
ered majority age (age 18 or emancipated minor).  
 
Superintendents use these agreements when it is deemed to be in the best interest of 
the student. We feel that rubber stamping these agreements takes away the im-
portance of a yearly review that will look at the students performance, but will give 
the district the opportunity to review the conditions that were considered when the 
Superintendents agreement first occurred and whether these conditions are still valid.  
 
A yearly review also emphasizes the importance of the agreement and that it is not 
taken for granted and also allows the district to look at their local conditions and 
whether they can still support the agreement.
