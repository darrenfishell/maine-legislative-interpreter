Testimony in Support of LD 1684-, An Act to Invest in the Health and Wellness of 
Older Maine Residents by Expanding Coordinated Community Programming 
Greetings Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services. l am Bridget Quinn, Associate State Director of 
Advocacy and Outreach for AARP Maine. 
AARP is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering 
Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our more than 
200,000 members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony. Today, I am 
testifying in favor of LD 1684. 
The bill before you, LD 1684, allocated critical funding to Maine's Area Agencies on Aging 
(AAA). AARP research has found that older Mainers wish to remain in their homes or 
communities for as long as possible.1 However, as we age many of us find that we will need 
support that may come from one of Maine's AAAs. Maine's AAAs provide single-entry 
points that provide Mainer’s information about long term services and supports. Mainers 
can have their needs assessed and determined their eligibility for public programs. 
However, as Mainers face more complicated questions about care coordination due to 
rising costs to remain in their homes, lack of availability of direct care support many need 
more support. 
LD 1684 will 
0 Provide one-time funding to develop interventions and deliver navigation 
and case management services for older adults. 
Q Provide ongoing funding to develop interventions and deliver navigation and 
case management services for older adults in each of Maine's coordinated 
community program areas. 
This will be welcome news to people like Maine's 166,000 unpaid family caregivers who 
are enabling loved ones to age in place but struggling due to a lack of support. In order to 
make our communities more age friendly and livable we need to make this investment into

Maine's AAAs so they can continue to do their work in supporting Mainers in their homes 
and communities — where they want to be. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. We urge this committee to support LD 1684
