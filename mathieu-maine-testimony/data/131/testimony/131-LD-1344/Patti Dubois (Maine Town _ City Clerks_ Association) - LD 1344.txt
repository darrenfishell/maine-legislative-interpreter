Re: LD 1344 – An Act to Improve  the State’s  Election  Laws by Amending  the Laws 
Relating  to Automatic  Voter Registration  
 
Position: Support 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is in support of LD 1344 and we thank you for the 
opportunity to outline our points for your Committee. 
 
Members indicated support for the concept of changing the deadline to 7 days before the 
election to accept Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) applications.  Since the 
implementation of AVR, clerks and registrars have often experienced frustration from 
residents who had recently registered to vote at the BMV but were not listed on the 
incoming voter list on election day because state law establishes a closed period where 
voters must register in person during the 21 days preceding election day.  
 
Although most clerks acknowledge that Maine should move forward with technology and 
move away from printed check-in lists at some point, some expressed that any movement 
in this direction should be done cautiously so that Maine’s stellar reputation is maintained 
regarding the successful administration of its elections.   
 
Clerks also pointed out that, as a state that has one of the oldest populations, it may be 
more difficult to utilize retired citizens as election workers if they are intimidated by new 
technology.  Currently, election workers only need to read a printed list and use a red pen 
to check off incoming voters. Concern was raised about costs for new hardware and 
software that may be needed to modernize the check in process. 
 
Members were concerned that this doesn’t mandate use of one method or another, and it 
was apparent that some towns with limited access to broadband may have a paper only 
option.  Consistency is the optimal goal but may be difficult to achieve in our vast state. 
 
Ultimately, members noted that this change in language doesn’t commit the state to any 
specific technology.
