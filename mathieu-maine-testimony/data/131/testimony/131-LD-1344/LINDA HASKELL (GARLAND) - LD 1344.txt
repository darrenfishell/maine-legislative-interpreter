L.D.1344 H.P. 858 LINDA HASKELL, GARLAND, TESTIMONY IN 
OPPOSITION TO 
An Act to Improve the State's Election Laws by Amending the Laws
Relating to Automatic Voter Registration Sec. 1. 21-A MRSA §1, sub-§21, as 
amended by PL 2011, c. 342, §4, does not need to be amended any further. On lines 
14 &15 of LD1344 need to remain as previously worded; "printed". The lines 23 - 26 
should not be added as changed per this so called Improvement Act. Sec. 1. 21-A 
MRSA §1, sub-§21, as amended by PL 2011, c. 342, §4 should remain the 
same.Making changes to cheat the peoples voting system is not in the interest of the 
population of registered voters in Maine.It appears this is for one political party to 
reign over the entire system. It also appears there is no partisanship here.LINDA
