RE: LD 57, A11 Aet to Amend Zl/Iezz' ne’x Endangered and T/areatened Speeier Lin‘ 
Dear Chair LaFountain, Chair Landry, and Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildhfe Committee: 
On behalf of Maine Audubon and our 30,000 members and supporters, thank you for the 
opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 57, A/1/let to Amend ll/Iai/1e ’; E/zda/ggered and 
Threatened Speeies Lin‘. 
Maine Audubon supports the Maine Endangered Species Act (MESA) as an important tool to 
conserve the state’s most vulnerable species. We concur with the Department of Inland Fisheries and 
\X/ildlife ’s (DlF\X/) proposed additions and modifications to the list of endangered and threatened 
species as detailed in LD 5'7. As each of their populations are dramatically declining in the state, we 
strongly support the Department ’s suggestions of extending protections to the following eight species: 
Bank Swallow, Cliff Swallow, Bicknell's Thrush, Blackpoll Warbler, Saltmarsh Sparrow, Tricolored Bat, 
Ashton’s Cuckoo Bumble Bee, and Marginated Tiger Beetle. 
For decades, Maine Audubon has worked collaboratively with the Department to conserve 
Piping Plovers and Least Terns, two species listed as endangered under MESA. Listing under MESA 
has afforded additional funding to care for these birds and their breeding habitats, increased public 
awareness of the threats to these birds, and provided regulatory mechanisms for reviewing potential 
negative impacts to their nesting habitat such as the designation of “Essential Habitat. ” As a result, 
Piping Plover pairs and ﬂedglings are at record high numbers -— a tenfold increase since the species’ 
listing in the 1980s. It is worth noting that Maine has an exceptionally good track record of working 
collaboratively with businesses, municipalities, and landowners to manage listed species and listed 
species’ habitat. Rarely has MESA been utilized to stop development. Instead, the Department works 
cooperatively with landowners and developers to minimize disturbances to listed species, and removes 
them once their populations have recovered, as was the case for the Bald Eagle. 
Maine Audubon is hopeful that the Department ’s proposed listings within LD 57 will lead to 
similar success stories. Let’s consider one of those species. Saltmarsh Sparrows are a small but 
impressive songbird that has been able to thrive in Maine’s salt marshes by timing their nesting with 
tidal cycles. Unfortunately, their numbers have been in steep decline because increased storm activity 
and sea level rise has led to more frequent nest ﬂooding. Keeping these birds in Maine and beyond 
requires collaboration between a variety of stakeholders, including municipal officials, private 
landowners, biologists, engineers, and more. Our experience protecting listed, beach~nesting birds 
demonstrates that MESA can help foster these productive relationships. Our organization looks 
forward to using the increased protections and awareness listing will bring to Saltmarsh Sparrows to 
facilitate collaboration among those agencies and organizations working to both restore tidal marshes

and protect nesting habitat for Saltmarsh Sparrows. Because without successful nesting, the population 
will surely continue to decline. 
Population threats and information about population status are rapidly changing for the species 
considered by the Department, as well as for other species. In addition to making these changes today, 
we strongly support the Department performing the listing review process every 2 to 4 years, as 
opposed to their typical 8-year time frame. We believe that this action will improve the Department ’s 
ability to respond to increasingly rapid changes to population threats and conditions and stave off truly 
signiﬁcant population declines. We also encourage the Department to gather additional information 
about species that they have already considered listing, but lack concrete population data on, so that 
the Department may better assess whether those species are a good candidate for listing. 
As species’ populations begin to drop or as once-common animal species become less common 
in Maine, it’s imperative that both the state and federal governments assess, plan, and act. MESA has 
been instrumental in protecting imperiled species in Maine since 1975 and is an essential step in that 
process. We strongly encourage the Committee to support this bill. Thank you for your time and I am 
happy to answer any questions. 
Sincerely, 
%w~»61&r-6»

RE: LD 57, An /la‘ to Amend ]\4az' ne'.v Elzdangered and T/mate/zed Species List 
Saltmarsh Sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus) 
Proposed listing: Endangered 
The coastal habitat for this secretive bird is being degraded 
by sea level rise and encroaching development across its 
range. Climate change fueled storms and tidal surges flood 
nests before the chicks can fly. Biologists have measured an 
annual 10.6% decline in the state Saltmarsh Sparrow 
breeding population since monitoring began in 1998 and are 
projected to be extinct by 2050 if current conditions 
continue.
> 
Ashton Cuckoo Bumble Bee (Bombus asbtonz) 
Proposed listing: Endangered 
Like the cuckoo bird, which lays its eggs in the 
nests of other bird species, the Ashton Cuckoo 
Bumble Bee infiltrates the colonies of other bee 
species and takes over, forcing the bees in the host 
colony to raise the Ashton young. Like many 
pollinators, the Ashton Cuckoo Bumble Bee is 
experiencing steep population declines around 
North America (up to 90°/o loss), and is currently 
known from only a single location in Maine.

Blackpoll Warbler (Sctopbaga striata) 
Proposed listing: Threatened Bicknell ’s Thrush (Catbarus 
b1'c1me1I1) 
Proposed listing: Threatened 
Bicknell ’s Thrush has a very limited 
breeding range: stunted forests at the 
treeline of mountains in New 
England and northeastern Canada. 
This already-rare habitat is further 
threatened by climate change and 
industrial forestry. Biologists believe 
that about 20% of the world’s 
population of Bicknell ’s Thrush 
breeds in Maine. 
This understated Warbler breeds in Maine’s 
boreal forests, and is undergoing a 
prolonged population decline. State 
biologists estimate that Blackpoll Warbler 
numbers are down by 99% since 1960, and 
by 59°/o since 2010. The Blackpoll Warbler is 
already at the southern edge of its range in 
Maine’s boreal forests, and also faces threats 
during migration and on its wintering 
grounds on islands in the Caribbean and in 
northern regions of South America. 
Bank Swallow (Rlparia r1paria) and Cliff Swallo 
Proposed listing: Threatened 
Like other aerial insectivores, populations of these 
two swallow species have declined sharply in 
recent years. Cliff Swallows have experienced an 
estimated 6.9% per year decline in Maine between 
1966 and 2019, and Bank Swallows have had an w (Pettochelidon pyrrhozzota)

estimated 10.9% annual decrease. There is some 
evidence that a lack of suitable nesting areas is 
impacting Bank Swallows, while Cliff Swallows may 
be particularly susceptible to impacts on their 
South American wintering grounds.

Tricolored Bat (Perimyotis subﬂavus)i 
Proposed listing: Threatened 
Like many North American bat species, the 
Tricolored Bat has been devastated by White- 
nose Syndrome. Their historical low 
abundance in Maine and susceptibility to 
Wl1lt€—ﬂOSC syndrome make conservation an 
urgent concern. 
Margined Tiger Beetle (Ellipsoptera marginata) 
Proposed Listing: Threatened 
The Margined Tiger Beetle lives along intertidal 
zones, back beaches, saline flats, salt marshes, 
beaches, and tidal mud flats along the Atlantic coast. 
It is known from just 13 locations in seven Maine 
towns between York and Georgetown, and its low 
and fragmented populations are further threatened 
by sea-level rise and habitat degradation from 
adjacent development.
