I am wondering why the Wood Turtle is not on this list.  
Last summer I was on a back road in Montville and took the time to help one cross 
the road. It was so unusual, I went right home to look up what species it was.  Without
question: Wood Turtle.   
I sincerely hope the Wood Turtle will continue to be a priority for us and am very 
concerned at its absence from your list. They are definitely here and they need our 
support.  
Thank You.
