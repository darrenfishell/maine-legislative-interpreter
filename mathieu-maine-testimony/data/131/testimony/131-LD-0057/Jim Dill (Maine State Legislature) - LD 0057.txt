-~ Testimony of Rep. James Dill introducing 
LD 57, An Act to Amend Maine's Endangered and Threatened Species List 
Before the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and distinguished members of the Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife Committee, my name is Jim Dill, and I represent House District 26 and the 
communities of Bradley, Old Town and Penobscot Indian Island. I am here before you today to 
present LD 57, An Act to Amend Maine's Endangered and Threatened Species List. 
This bill makes amendments to the State's list of endangered and threatened species pursuant to' 
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 12803. It removes the box turtle and the rapids 
clubtail from the endangered species list. It adds the Ashton's cuckoo bumble bee and the 
saltmarsh sparrow to the endangered species list. It adds the bank swallow, the Bicknell ’s thrush, 
the blackpoll warbler, the cliff swallow, the margined tiger beetle and the tricolored bat to the 
threatened species list. It also makes some taxonomic nomenclature changes. 
This bill comes from the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, so I would ask that you 
reserve your questions for the experts that will follow after me. 
Thank you for your time and attention. 
District 26: Bradley, Old Town and Penobscot Indian Island
