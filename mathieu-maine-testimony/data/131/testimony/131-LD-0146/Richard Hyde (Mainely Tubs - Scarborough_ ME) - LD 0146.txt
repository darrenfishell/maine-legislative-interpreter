We are testifying to express our concern about the requirement for an engineers stamp
indicating that a proposed spa meets the minimum standards for all spas, as 
designated by the American National Standards Institute and the Association of Pool 
and Spa Professionals.
We believe that there are a number of Maine Bed & Breakfast Inns that would be 
interested in having a hot tub for their guests.  Guests look for hot tubs when choosing
a place to state or an area to vacation at.   In many cases, the intended "load" on a spa 
at a small B&B would not be that much greater than the load that a large family of 
regular hot tub users might place on their tub, yet requirements such as this one can 
easily make it cost prohibitive for a small B&B to install a hot tub.
The reality is that a commercial grade hot tub can be poorly maintained, and a 
non-"commercial grade" hot tub can accommodate heavy usage while maintaining 
sparkling clear water.   The difference comes down to how the water is maintained.  
We believe there should be a standard for water sanitation, and NOT for whether the 
tub is commercially-rated.  Let the B&B owner or Inn Keeper maintain a log showing
how frequently they sanitize the water, and what their chlorine readings are, and 
specify that chlorine levels need to be maintained at the CDC's standard of a 
minimum of 3 parts per million for a chlorine tub (or 2 ppm for a salt water tub).  This
will keep the water sanitized, but this can be done at a cost that is affordable for a 
small B&B or Inn owner.  
Thank you
