District 99: Brunswick (Part), HarpswellTestimony of Rep. Cheryl Golek in support of
LD 527, An Act to Allow Municipalities to Create Bicycle and Pedestrian 
Zones with Reduced Speed Limits
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and distinguished members of the Transportation 
Committee, my name is Cheryl Golek and I represent House District 99 which consists of the 
Town of Harpswell and part of Brunswick. I write in support of LD 527, An Act to Allow 
Municipalities to Create Bicycle and Pedestrian Zones with Reduced Speed Limits. 
This bill will grant Maine towns more power to set slower speed limits to encourage biking and 
walking. I am one of the co-sponsors of this bill because I heard from many constituents in my 
district, from Brunswick to Harpswell, about their frustration with the speed of the vehicles on 
the roads and how unsafe it felt to walk or bike on them.
The local people in our towns and cities are the true experts on what they need to create safe 
roads. Therefore, they should be given the ability to make such changes to improve the safety of 
the towns and cities in which they live.
I am asking that the committee vote ought to pass and give our towns and cities the authority 
they not only deserve, but need to keep their roads safe for all.  Thank you.
