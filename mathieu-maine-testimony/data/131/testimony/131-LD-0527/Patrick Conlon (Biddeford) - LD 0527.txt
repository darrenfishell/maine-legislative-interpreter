Good afternoon. My name is Patrick Conlon  and I’m  a resident of York County in the City of 
Biddeford.  
I am here to testify in complete support of LD 527.  The street I live on in Biddeford is posted 
30mph and all the other streets in this neighborhood a re posted 25  mph . I’ve spoken to the 
Biddeford City Council and asked multiple times for the speed limit to be lowered to 25 but I get 
nowhere . Since the speed limit is posted at 30 mph most cars are going closer to 40 because it’s 
common kno wledge  that the police rarely  pull people over for speeding until they are going at 
least 10 mph over the limit. My street is completely residential  with only one “business” on it 
and cars are traveling  35-40-45 mph. Guess what the one business on my stre et is?       It’s an 
amazing and very busy youth center. I think it’s only a matter of time before some innocent 
young person is run over trying to get to the youth center. It’s insane. Municipalities need to 
have more control over their own local roads th at their local citizens know and understand 
because they live here. The Maine Department of Transportation needs to untie the hands of 
local control over local streets  for the sake of real safety improvements that don’t take years to 
implement.  
Thank you for listening.
