This bill would permit towns/cities to reduce speed limits to 25 mph on roads 
currently posted at 35 mph or less and with a volume of 6000 vehicles or less without 
a speed study and create bike/ped zones in “downtowns.” Speeding is the most 
common reason people say they do not walk or bike more and the process to reduce 
speed limits can be slow and often counterproductive.
Maine must make the process easier for municipalities to make changes to OUR 
LOCAL STREETS to make them more bike and pedestrian friendly. Please help 
make our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians and help to reduce the injuries and 
deaths that occur every year in our towns and cities.
