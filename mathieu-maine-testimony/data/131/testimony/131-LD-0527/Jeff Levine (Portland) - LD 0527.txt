Joint Standing Committee on Transportation  
Maine Legislature  
 
March 1, 2023 
 
Re: LD527 (An Act to Allow Municipalities to Create Bicycle and Pedestrian Zones with Reduced Speed Limits)  
 
Distinguished Members of the Committee on Transportation:  
 
I would like to offer my support for LD 527. Speed limits should be set based on a number of priorities, 
including municipal planning efforts to create hospitable zones for all users. The current system of 
setting speed limits does not permit cities and towns to implement local plans that have economic, 
social, and equity benefits for residents, as it turns the focus onto drivers and ignores other users of 
roadways.  
 
In addition, I’ d offer my suppo rt of the friendly amendments proposed by the Maine Association of 
Planners, as follows:  
 
• Consider expanding the zones where this measure may be applied by swapping “downtowns ” in 
line 21 with “ designated growth areas of a municipality consistent with sect ion 4349-A, 
subsection 1, paragraph A ” 
• Allow reductions from speeds up to 45 miles per hour in order to capture streets with 
unacceptably high speed limits  
• Consider replacing the word “ and” with “or” in line 21, which would then read “ speed limit is 35 
miles per hour or less and  or where not more than 6,000 motor vehicles ” 
 However, I don ’t support their proposed amendment to increase the AADT for streets this applies to 
from 6,000 to 12,000.   
While this bill is a n impo rtant step, th e number one determinant of travel speeds is not the speed limit, 
but the design speed of the road. The best way to calm traffic is to  design a roadway for the desired 
travel speeds and time traffic signals accord ingly . I’d encou rage members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transpor tation to also  think of ways to expedite effort s to create C omplete Streets in 
Main e’s town and city centers . Regardless,  LD 527 is a good first step in Maine ’s efforts to plan for a 
vibrant and economically prosperous future. 
 
Sincerely,
