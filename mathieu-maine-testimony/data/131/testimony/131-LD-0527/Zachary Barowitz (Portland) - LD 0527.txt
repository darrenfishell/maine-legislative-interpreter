LD 527
Honorable Members:
I am happy to write in support of  LD 527 as I believe it is a critical step in making our State's 
roads safer as well as better able to achieve goals in  sustainability, public health, and even 
economic development.
The one recommendation I would make is to remove the vehicle count. Not only is the 
proposed count low and thus restrictive, it seems a rather blunt instrument insofar as it does 
not take into account local contexts, time of day/seasonal volumes, and a host of both 
qualitative and quantitative factors that such analysis deserves. Additionally, traffic counts are
costly and time consuming.
We've had a number of bicycle and pedestrian deaths in our community lately and the
numbers don't seem to be going down, so I thank you for considering this bill to make
our communities safer.
