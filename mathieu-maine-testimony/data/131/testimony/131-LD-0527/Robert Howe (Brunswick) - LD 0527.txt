Re: In support of L.D. 527, An Act to Allow Municipalities to Create Bicycle and Pedestrian 
Zones with Reduced Speed Limits '' 
Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and committee members: 
I liveon a road with a speed limit of 35 m.p.h. in what at first glace may appear toa 
driver unfamiliar with the area to be a rural neighborhood with little vehicular traffic. While 
that may be true, in fact, this neighborhood is functionally a public park due to the high volume 
of pedestrian and bicycle traffic, pretty much year round. 
Just since I started typing this letter, at least nine people and three dogs have walked past 
my window. Bicyclists and walkers drive to the far end of this road and park, in order then to 
walk or bike on this and adjoining roads. My wife and I are among the frequent dog walkers 
here.' 
Avehicle passing us at 35 m.p.h. can be downright scary, since there are no sidewalks 
and the shoulders are narrow. Other roads in town have lower speed limits even though the 
roads are wider and there are sidewalks. The distinguishing difference in speed limits seems to 
be only the number of houses in a given distance, and not anything related to practical safety 
considerations. 
There is some history to efforts by others in this neighborhood to have the speed limit 
lowered to 25 m.p.h., but to no avail. Perhaps that is because current law does not appear to 
allow the Town of Brunswick to do so. L.D. 527 would give the town this latitude. I urge your 
support of the bill.l 
Sincerely yours, ti
