LD 527
My home is located at 78 Spring Street in Brunswick.  I've lived in Brunswick for 30 
years. One of the main reasons we moved to Brunswick was the close proximity to 
downtown shopping, the library, our dentist, the Farmer's Market, and more.  Our 
family has had what we have called the "2 mile rule" – walk or ride a bike unless you 
are going more than 2 miles. Walking and riding a bike are good exercise and are 
better for the environment. Safety while walking and riding about town has become a 
concern over the last few years. It seems people are driving faster than the residential 
speed of 25 mph on many streets in town including Spring Street.  It is actually rare to
see a car drive at the residential speed. When walking, biking, or crossing streets 
where cars are traveling at speeds greater than 25 mph there is the potential for an 
unfortunate accident.  I support  LD 527, An Act to Allow Municipalities to Create 
Bicycle and Pedestrian Zones with Reduced Speed Limits. It makes sense for 
members of a town council, in conjunction with local law enforcement, to have the 
ability to create low speed zones and deploy traffic calming measures. I'm always 
happy to see citizens of Maine towns walking and riding for multiple reasons. Sadly, 
we’ve created a world in which cars rule and it’s time to balance out the equation for 
all of the users of the streets of Maine
