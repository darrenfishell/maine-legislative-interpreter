I live at 35 Weymouth Street in Brunswick which is close enough to downtown 
shopping, the post office, the library and many other essentials that I very infrequently
need to drive my car. I prefer to walk and ride my bike whenever possible and 
distance-wise, I live in a place where that works. It’s good for me and it’s good for the
environment. However, there are many times when I feel that the motorists around me
are intent on getting to wherever they are going as quickly as possible, and see me on 
foot or on my bike as an impediment, in spite of a few “Share the Road” signs here 
and there. My street happens to be one of those that many folks use to get into and out
of the downtown area. At high traffic times of day when people are rushing to work 
and school or rushing home again, it feels dangerous to venture out on my 
neighborhood street which has no sidewalks. I know that my chance of survival if hit 
by a car moving at 40 mph is far lower than if I’m hit by a car traveling 25 mph. My 
street is not singular in this way. Giving my town council, in conjunction with local 
law enforcement, the ability to create low speed zones and deploy traffic calming 
measures is a good idea.  More citizens of Maine towns are walking and riding and 
this is a good thing for multiple reasons.  Let’s create an environment in which these 
positive actions are encouraged and protected.  We’ve created a world in which cars 
rule and it’s time to balance out the equation for all of the users of our streets.
