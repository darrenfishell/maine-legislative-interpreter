LD 527
Dear Members of the Transportation Committee -
I write in support of LD 527. 
Like many people, we have been frustrated by our inability to have some reasonable 
level of input and control over speed limits on our road and areas.   
Our area in Brunswick has changed tremendously over the years, and has not only 
grown in population, but in use of the recreational use of the roads by pedestrians, 
bicyclists, naturalist and alike.   The Town has recognized the issue, but seems 
powerless to do a thing about it, citing extremely long wait times for DOT review, 
and no opportunity for meaningful public input once that review gets scheduled, if 
ever.  
When I spoke to person a DOT about the situation, they confirmed what the Town 
conveyed.  They also said their was a significant change the speed limit on our road 
had never been reviewed since it was first set many decades ago.   
Let's modernize this antiquated approach that is centered on motorized vehicles.   If 
one of the DOT's prime goals is increased safetey and allowing for non motorized 
traffic, let's start here by getting realistic control back in the hands of the local 
communities that know and use these roads the most. 
Sincerely -
