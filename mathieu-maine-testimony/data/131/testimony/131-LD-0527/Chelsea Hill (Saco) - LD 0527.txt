I am writing to express my support for this piece of legislation, and also to encourage the 
committee to consider including, as possible, language that will allow municipalities to control 
speed limits and improved bicycle/pedestrian infrastructure on State Aid Highways, 
specifically those covered under the Maine Urban Compact Zone rules. 
I have personally experienced my municipality blaming these Urban Compact Zones as 
reasons why nothing can be done about completely unsafe traffic conditions in purely 
residential parts of town (in my specific case, Bradley Street/Route 5 in Saco). Having specific
language to this effect will reduce the opportunity for this "gray area" to exist, where 
municipalities can shift blame to the state rather than take ownership of responsibilities to 
residents, who deserve safe places to walk and ride their bikes, or simply exist in their own 
front yards.
