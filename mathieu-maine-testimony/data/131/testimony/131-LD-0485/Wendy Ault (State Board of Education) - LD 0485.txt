                                              Testimony from the State Board of Education 
In Opposition to LD 485, sponsored by Representative Newman: Resolve, To Amend the Rules Regarding 
Athletic Director Qualifications
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, Distinguished Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, my name is Wendy Ault. I submit this testimony on behalf of the State Board of Education in 
opposition to LD 485: Resolve, To Amend the Rules Regarding Athletic Director Qualifications.
First a point of clarification. This legislation impacts Chapter 115 which is a State Board of Education Rule 
and not a Department of Education Rule.
As a result of the recent revisions to Chapter 115, the Diversity course requirement was added to all 
Certificates awarded in Maine.  The State Board of Education stands strongly behind the Diversity course 
requirement.  We urge you to oppose eliminating the Diversity course from the Athletic Director 
endorsement. 
We will be available for the Work Session.
