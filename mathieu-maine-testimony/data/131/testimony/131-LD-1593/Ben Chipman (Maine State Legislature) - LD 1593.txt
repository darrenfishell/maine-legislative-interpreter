This legislation would remove restrictions on constructing or converting existing 
structures into: residential housing. LD 1593 removes minimum lot size 
requirements for multiple unit housing, dwelling unit density requirements for 
single-family or multifamily housing, and minimum size requirements for 
accessory dwelling units outside of the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code 
(MUBEC). 0 '

The housing crisis in this state is dire. It is upto us at the State House to ensure 
that we are doing everything we canto find ways to address“ this crisis. Myl‘ 
contributionis to lift restrictions to expand,opportunities,to create housing. Under 
current laws protecting zoning ordinances, there are many lots that cannot be built 
on because of existing ordinances , enforced? by municipalities. Inorder to create 
more opportunities to build new or repurpose existing housing, we can allowI 
construction on lots that were previously deemed forbidden from residential use. 
In a time when so many are losing their homes, it is important that we take‘ 
extraordinary measures. Housingcannot be built unless we can ensure that land is 
available to do so. _ _ —I
