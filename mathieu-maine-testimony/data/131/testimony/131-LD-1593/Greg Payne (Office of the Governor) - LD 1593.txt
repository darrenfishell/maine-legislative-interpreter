Testimony In Opposition To 
L.D. 1593, An Act to Increase Affordable Housing Development 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and distinguished members of the Joint Select Committee 
on Housing, my name is Greg Payne and I serve as the Senior Advisor on Housing Policy in the 
Governor ’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future. I am here today to offer testimony in 
opposition to L.D. 1593, An Act to Increase Affordable Housing Development. 
This proposal seeks to eliminate the density bonus adopted last year as part of L.D. 2003, the 
landmark law which reduces regulatory barriers to housing. The density bonus allows fora 
developer to achieve 2.5x the base density within a jurisdiction if the proposed housing meets 
certain affordability requirements. For example, if a developer proposed to build housing on a lot 
which has a density limit of 10 units, he or she would be eligible to build up to 25 housing units 
so long as the affordability requirements of L.D. 2003 are also met. L.D. 1593 would eliminate 
this key provision from L.D. 2003, taking our state backwards in efforts to address our housing 
shortage. 
In addition, this bill proposes to allow residential construction in any zoning district. This would 
result in a mandate on municipalities requiring them to permit residential construction in 
conservation, commercial, industrial, and agricultural districts. Such an expansive allowance 
would disrupt community planning, mitigation of sprawl, and threaten protected habitat and 
working farmland. The proposal runs counter to pairing most housing with designated growth 
areas and access to public water/ sewer systems. 
Finally, for the organized municipalities statewide, the proposed language does not appear to 
help with multiple unit housing development per conversations we’ve had with staff at DACF. 
Rather, the proposal leaves a multiple unit housing activity in the “any land use activity ” 
category with no direction for how to compute the waste disposal requirements. It would thus 
make it more difﬁcult to determine and to obtain approval rather than making it easier to obtain 
such ‘approval. 
For these reasons, we oppose L.D. 15 93. Thank you for consideration and I’d be happy to answer 
any questions.
