To whom it may concern;
As a taxpayer in our beautiful state, I fully support this initiative. Keeping people in 
prison is incredibly expensive, and the longer one is kept out of society, the less of a 
chance they have of making a smooth reentry as a productive member of society. 
Parole is also a wonderful incentive for incarcerated Mainers to prove themselves 
worthy of this privilege while serving their time. 
Please bring Maine back into line with established best practices, give us tax payers 
some relief, and allow incarcerated Mainers the chance to re-enter society -with 
guidance and oversight - so that they may get on with their productive lives.
Thank you.
