LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
My name is Tina Moon and I support parole in Maine. My brother in law, brother, 
fianc√© and dear friend are all incarcerated at the Maine State Prison. I can see 
personally in the lives of these men how parole is so crucial. One of these men has 
been imprisoned since 1978. If he had any hope of release, he would be doing so 
much to rehabilitate himself. Instead, his dream is nothing more but to die peacefully 
and be laid to rest at the farm. Despite his crime, he is a gentle soul with a profound 
mind and would have much to offer society. All of these men entered the prison at 
very young ages and are very remorseful for their crimes. While they should be 
punished for their crimes, what many people fail to recognize is that their crimes are a
moment of time in their lives that do not define their entire lives. Please give them 
time to yes...do time for their crime but also to come out and do their time for society 
by being part of that society by serving in it by truly atoning for their wrongs.
