LD 178
I am writing in support of LD178 to reinstate parole in Maine.  
Parole for deserving people would build healthier communities in our state.  If those evaluated
as posing no risk to society were released under DOC supervision, they could serve their 
sentences as they transitioned to their communities.  That situation would naturally provide 
incentives for rehabilitation.  It would be better for those paroled, their families and the 
taxpayers.
