Times have changed. And by "times" I mean the last 200 years of
incarceration! In multiple cultures worldwide we have learned that our personalities, our 
behaviors change permanently as an expression of neuroplasticity Although clearly an 
evolving science, the intentionality of 
neuroscience suggests that Departments of Correction can now do what
their title suggests; and that is to make corrections in the brain functions of those people who 
have made bad decisions. Not only is this possible, it is now measurable. 
For example: the national recidivism rate for previously incarcerated individuals is 
approximately 67%. The recidivism rate for prison residents who have completed a higher 
education degree and been released is approximately 5%. Notwithstanding the many 
nuances that make up those resident populations, those are the facts. 
Can we conclude that people change? I believe so. And because I believe this to be true we 
can now consider parole as a reasonable alternative to incarceration for those who have 
changed permanently prior to their arbitrary release date. 
Obviously, a host of psychological testing must be applied in order to guarantee, to the extent
possible, permanent neurological (personality)
change; however, the testing is possible if we choose to make it so. What better time to 
consider parole; in fact, it is the only time to consider parole and that is when residents have 
changed and no longer are likely to make bad decisions. 67% recidivism? Where's the 
"corrections" in that? versus 5% recidivism... The option for parole must be made available 
because the science of how people change points to the simple
fact that incarceration is no longer necessary.
