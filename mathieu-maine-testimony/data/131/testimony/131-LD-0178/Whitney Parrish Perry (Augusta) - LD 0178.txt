Testimony of Whitney A. Parrish Perry
In Support of LD 178
An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the Community
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety
March 13, 2023
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety:
My name is Whitney Parrish Perry, and I am a resident of Augusta. While I was 
unable to attend the public hearing due to a serious chronic health condition, I am 
writing in enthusiastic support of LD 178, An Act to Support Reentry and 
Reintegration into the Community and send my deepest gratitude to Chair Sen. Pinny 
Beebe-Center for introducing this critical piece of legislation.
In 2022, I served as a commissioner on the Maine State Legislature’s Commission to 
Examine Reestablishing Parole. I occupied the seat designated for a “representative of
an organization advocating for the interests of racial minorities” as then-Acting 
Executive Director of the Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous,
and Tribal Populations, and I thank the Honorable Jeffrey Evangelos for his extensive
work on this issue and care in crafting the commission’s composition. There is no 
way to talk about the criminal legal system, in Maine or the U.S., without 
acknowledging and confronting the differential and unjust treatment of Black people, 
especially Black men, and other community members of color in that system. I 
believe that reestablishing parole is one step we can take together toward uprooting 
past and ongoing harms to create a more just, healthier, and safer place for all of us.
You have heard excellent testimony and evidence of why reestablishing parole 
matters, and I do not know that I will say anything here that you have not heard. 
However, I acknowledge that I may hold a unique viewpoint given my orientation to 
the issue: as a commissioner, as someone who has worked extensively in criminal 
legal reform and transformation in Maine, as someone who has watched and 
personally felt the impacts—and fall out—of incarceration, as someone who 
previously worked in the domestic violence field in Maine, as a survivor myself, and 
as someone who intensely believes in transformation and hope. 
With that said, I want to share what I found most compelling from my time serving on
the commission—where we found the broadest agreement among commissioners. 
While consensus can be nearly impossible in any body comprised of individuals from 
different political parties, ideologies, backgrounds, and beyond, the threads woven 
throughout that stuck out most for me include:
1)Among supporters and non-supporters of parole, we believe the safety, comfort, 
rights, and agency of survivor/victims are essential priorities. 
I believe parole and other mechanisms of release are not and should not be antithetical
to maintaining the safety, comfort, rights, and agency of survivor/victims. In fact, as 
evidenced by presenters and testifiers, non-carceral pathways to rehabilitation and 
undoing harm are often encouraged by survivor/victims. Many survivor/victims 
acknowledge that incarceration causes harm in itself and that this does not make them
or their communities more safe. They also acknowledge that unnecessarily long 
prison sentences do not create safety and often cause more harm. Of course, there is 
no “one-size-fits-all” response from survivor/victims, just as there is no 
one-size-fits-all solution to addressing harm—though the pervasive use of 
incarceration attempts to suggest otherwise with little to no evidence to support its 
efficacy. A carefully crafted parole system that preserves the agency and rights of 
survivor/victims is possible, and I believe we can achieve that here.
2)Among supporters and non-supporters of parole, restorative practices and justice 
were upheld as critical components of rehabilitation and support, both for those 
harmed and those who caused harm. 
I believe the reestablishment of parole is, in itself, restorative. Additionally, there are 
multiple touch points in a parole system where restorative practices can be employed. 
The current way of doing things—from arrest to conviction to incarceration to 
reentry—does not seek to heal, nor does it heal. It does not give incentive to change 
or make different choices. It does not give hope. I fundamentally believe that systems 
of punishment do not facilitate healing, do not instill hope, and only perpetuate harm. 
I lost track of the number of times the phrase “hurt people hurt people” was said 
during commission meetings, including by survivor/victims’ rights groups. If hurt 
people hurt people, let’s do everything we can to promote their healing and 
well-being.
It is important to note here that there was ample talk—on and off mic—from 
corrections and corrections-adjacent commissioners and state employees about the 
incredible work and accomplishments of individuals currently incarcerated in Maine. 
This was often given as evidence of why the current system is “working.” “Working 
for whom, for what, and to what end” is a question I think about often, especially 
given the financial and human costs of incarceration. Why keep someone incarcerated
if they have completely transformed who they are?
The accomplishments of these individuals are real, though. However, credit for these 
accomplishments does not lie in the practice of incarceration or with the Department. 
It lies in the individuals who built community care and support in impossible 
circumstances. It lies in their personal desire to heal and to promote the healing of all 
people who have been harmed, victims and prisoners alike. It lies in their hope for a 
different tomorrow—a tomorrow that allows them to thrive and contribute beyond the
confines of incarceration.
3)Among supporters and non-supporters of parole, we believe we must invest more 
financial and human resources into community safety beyond the criminal legal 
system. Housing, health care, public health infrastructure, and other investments are 
critical to reducing harm and building whole communities.
Reliance on incarceration is a public health issue. Period.  It does not address root 
causes for harmful behavior, it does not promote healing, it hurts the children and 
families of incarcerated people, it hurts the economic future of communities, and 
there is no evidence that it is making us more safe. The things that do make us safer 
include robust, self-determined public infrastructure, low barrier access to health care 
and support services, economic opportunity and security, and beyond.
There are a lot of talking points about this being an “either/or” situation. I believe it’s 
an “and” situation—we can create meaningful, accessible pathways to rehabilitation 
AND resource our communities appropriately. We have the funds; we need 
prioritization.
Reestablishing parole will take a lot of work. It will require ample care and deliberate 
implementation. I know you, your colleagues, and others invested in creating safety in
our communities are up for the task, and I believe your work can positively reorient 
our priorities away from punishment and toward transformation, health, and real 
safety. I ask that you vote ‘OUGHT TO PASS’ on LD 178 so we can continue 
working toward that common goal.
