LD 178
My name is Dawn Jennison, a resident of Bath Maine. I'm writing to show my 
support for LD 178, to reestablish Parole in Maine
As the mother of an inmate of the Maine State Prison, I agree with Parole for 
individuals that are working toward rehabilitation. Many families in Maine struggle to
get their loved ones the help they need before they commit an offense. We seek to 
help them with mental health, substance abuse, the skills to cope with life, and 
education to give them a place in this world. While serving a prison sentence, there 
are many that seek these things. They want to better themselves and they are now 
offered services to take such steps to do so, services that may have not been offered 
prior to incarceration. The wrong choices can put you in prison so making the right 
choices should count for something. Parole can do that for inmates that work towards 
bettering themselves and for the families that continue to support them. MSP has 
some very beneficial programs for inmates to become better people in our 
community, so lets reinstate parole
