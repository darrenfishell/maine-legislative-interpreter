LD 178
Honorable Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee and the Commission to Examine Re-establishing
Parole, thank you for your time and service, and for allowing me to articulate my 
strong support for LD 178.
I would like to read the testimony of Leo Hylton, which has already been uploaded, 
and who I understand cannot read his own testimony due to the fact he is a resident of
Maine State Prison.
Thank you for your consideration.
