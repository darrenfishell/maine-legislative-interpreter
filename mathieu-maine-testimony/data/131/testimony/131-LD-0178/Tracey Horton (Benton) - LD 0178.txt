I am a forensic psychologist with a PhD in Criminal Justice and teach Forensic 
Psychology and Criminal Justice courses at Thomas College in Waterville. Prior to 
my teaching career, I worked as a psychologist in the North Carolina Department of 
Corrections with male, female and juvenile persons who were incarcerated. I saw 
firsthand how destructive incarceration can be as well as how ill-prepared many were 
to reintegrate into society following their sentence. I strongly urge you to reestablish a
parole system for Maine, as it will not only provide support for those reentering 
society but also reduce harm and increase public safety by utilizing evidence-based 
practices to reduce recidivism. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
