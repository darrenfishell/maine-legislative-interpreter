Committee. 
Re: Testimony on behalf of LD 178 
March 13th, 2023 
My name is Gwendolyn Wellman and I am currently incarcerated at Southern Maine 
Womenâ€™s Reentry Center. I am writing to show my support for the passing of LD 
178. I am a certified Intentional Peer Support Specialist and Recovery Coach, both 
certified through the state of Maine. This allows me the opportunity to work in the 
Mental Health field upon my release. These are opportunities that I look forward to 
that will allow me to help my community. 
I believe that if LD 178 was passed, it would allow those who have earned the 
opportunity to reintegrate into their communities. LD 178 would also help people 
reconnect with their children. Maine currently spends millions of taxpayer dollars on 
incarceration. The money could be used for other resources, such as healing 
communities. 
Thank you for accepting my testimony on behalf of LD 178 and I hope to have your support 
on this bill. 
Respectfully, Gwendolynn Wellman
