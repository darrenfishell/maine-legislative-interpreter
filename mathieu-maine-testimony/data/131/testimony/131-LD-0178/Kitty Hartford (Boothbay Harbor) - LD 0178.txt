Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee
My name is Kitty (Kathryn) Hartford and I am a resident of Boothbay Harbor.  I am a 
retired Realtor, a great-grandmother, and have been an activist in areas of civil rights, 
peace, and justice for over 50 years, following in the footsteps of my Quaker 
grandparents.
Parole became a personal issue when my sister was murdered in 1982, and then later 
when my husband, my niece, and my grandson were incarcerated for substance 
abuse-related crimes.  I didn't always favor parole, but I do now.
Since joining the Restorative Justice Project-Maine and learning about alternatives to 
our current punitive criminal justice system, I now have hope that my loved ones may
receive the help they need and will be prepared to re-enter society, rejoin their 
families, and become productive members of our communities.
I will no longer be afraid of inmates being released having developed no skills other 
than becoming better criminals.  I will no longer resent paying taxes to warehouse, 
house, feed, and clothe thousands of men, women, and juveniles who are given little 
or no form of rehabilitation.  I will no longer wish I wasn't embarrassed about the way
we treat our fellow human beings.
Like the Ubantu philosophy of the indigenous people of South Africa, I believe that a 
person's humanity is dependent on the preservation and affirmation of the 
community's humanity.  Maine can once again be a leader in the right direction, and 
we can proudly proclaim, "As Maine goes, so goes the Nation!"
That's my story, edited and gnashed over, and I'm sticking to it.
Many thanks for all that you do.
Best regards,
Kitty Hartford
Boothbay Harbor
