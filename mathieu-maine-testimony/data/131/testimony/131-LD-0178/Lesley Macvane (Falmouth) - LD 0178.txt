Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee, my name is Lesley MacVane, and I am a resident of Falmouth, Maine 
and come from a family that has been here since the 1600s.
I am writing today in support of LD 178 primarily because parole gives the opportunity for a 
second chance to incarcerated citizens who have accepted the responsibility for the actions that 
caused them to be sentenced to life without parole.
Every person in prison should be eligible for parole. Putting people away for life and cutting 
them off from hope is inhumane and should be outlawed.
Thank you for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on you, too, to support LD 178.
Respectfully submitted, March 13, 2023,
