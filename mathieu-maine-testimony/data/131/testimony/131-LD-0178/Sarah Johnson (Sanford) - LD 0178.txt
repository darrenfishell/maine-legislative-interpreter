LD 178
I am writing in support of LD 178, An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the 
Community.
There is prevalent national data on the reduction in recidivism as well as reduction in taxpayer
costs with the implementation of parole, and that is all to the advantage of the citizens of 
Maine. My statement focuses on human and community benefits. Parole provides hope which
is a major support and motivational factor in rehabilitation and successful reentry. Parole can 
provide structure and needed support in transition to meaningful opportunities that contribute 
to family and community.  I believe that parole under LD 178 will prove the data to be correct 
and be a benefit on all levels of economics and humanity to the people of Maine. 
Please consider the advantages of LD 178, both those you can see on a calculator, and those
you can not.
