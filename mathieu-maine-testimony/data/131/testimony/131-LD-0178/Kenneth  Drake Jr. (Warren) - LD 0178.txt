Kenneth  Drake Jr.
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Kenneth Drake Jr. and I am writing in support of  LD 178.
Though I personally would not benefit from the passage of this bill, I believe that 
there are many people incarcerated at Maine State Prison and other MDOC facilities 
who could be safely released on parole. Over the 13 months I have been at MSP, I've 
met people who are truly remorseful and repentant of their crimes. A lot of these men 
are active in recovery, supportive to their fellow prisoners. Some also have earned 
degrees or are in college, and most are employed or volunteering in one or more 
programs.
There are many men here who deserve another chance, men who by their deeds while 
incarcerated show they want to change for the better, restore their relationships with 
their families and communities, and live a worthwhile life.
Admittedly, there are some prisoners who won't deserve parole or can't be safely 
released, but I believe parole should be an option for some prisoners, prisoners with 
good behavior, prisoners who have been active in their rehabilitation, and those who 
would support their families.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read my testimony.
