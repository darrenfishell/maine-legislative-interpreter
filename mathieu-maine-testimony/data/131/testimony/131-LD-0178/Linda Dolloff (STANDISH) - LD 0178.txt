Re: Testimony on behalf of LD 178 
March 13th, 2023 
My name is Karen Moon and I am currently a resident at Southern Maine Womenâ€™s Reentry 
Center. During my spent at SMWRC, I have participated in many meaningful programs, am 
taking college classes, and learning to heal from past trauma. 
I am writing to show my support for LD 178. I believe that people deserve a second chance once 
rehabilitated. Reentry and reintegration can move Maine in a new direction. We can save costs 
associated with recidivism while reconnecting Maine families. Evidence-based research 
demonstrates that restorative justice does work. We as Mainers are people who care about one 
another and have the ability to forgive those who have once caused harm. Second chances 
should be earned and LD 178 would be a positive addition to the Maine justice system. 
I appreciate you taking the time to read this testimony. 
Respectfully, Karen Moon
