Jeffrey Gagne
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Jeffrey M Gagne and I am writing in support of parole bill LD 178.
 First, I want to thank everyone involved who has been working endlessly on this 
parole bill. I understand there's still a lot more meaningful work to be done, so again, 
thank you.
 There are many benefits that come with the passing of this bill. some can be 
associated with a dollar amount that saves our taxpayers money. Other benefits that 
allow a man to be a loving father and husband are priceless.
 My sentence is light, yet I feel like I have learned so much in such a short period of 
time. I just received a certificate for successfully completing a criminal and addictive 
thinking course. I am currently enrolled in a houses of healing class that has already 
given me hope and inspiration. This class is guiding me towards healing my 
relationships with friends and family who are damaged as a result of my addiction. 
Preparing myself for a successful reentry into the community on a daily basis has me 
really looking forward to strengthening my relationships with my family.
Another reason for my strong support in favor of parole in Maine comes from 
meeting men that I firmly believe to be rehabilitated and well deserving of a second 
chance. We all make mistakes, it is how we learn. Mainers who make mistakes and 
are capable of rehabilitation should have the chance of parole.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to read my testimony. God bless.
