LD 178
I urge you to pass the LD 178 “Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the 
Community”.  The state of Maine in so many ways is a model for in the US for 
progressive and restorative criminal justice, including its innovative Earned Living 
Unit. The next logical step is to restore hope and healing for both the community and 
for incarcerated people who have worked hard to build a new. generative life even 
while behind bars.  
As a woman of faith, I believe deeply in the power of redemption, reconciliation, and 
reentry into the larger community even after having done great harm.  Without any 
hope, we are literally sapping the life out of the incarcerated individuals who keenly 
want to work for restoration and redemption, and we are robbing the broader 
community of the gifts and contributions that they can make.  Warehousing people in 
prisons does not accomplish lasting public safety and vitality.  Furthering Maine’s 
commitment to investing in restoration through thoughtful parole will reap an 
enormous harvest of thriving individuals and communities.
Sincerely, Karen Matsueda
