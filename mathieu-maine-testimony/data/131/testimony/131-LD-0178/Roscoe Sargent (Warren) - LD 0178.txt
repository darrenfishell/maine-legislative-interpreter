I was sentenced to serve a prison term of 50 years in 2004.   As things stand today, I'll
probably never get out of prison.  Despite the fact I have participated in and 
completed over 150 programs and I have attempted to enroll in college.  I am very 
interested in growing and improving myself whether or not I am ever allowed to 
return to society.  I would have even more reason to work towards rehabilitation and 
self growth if I had the possibility of parole someday and I know that would be a 
significant motivation for many residents here at the Maine State Prison to rehabilitate
themselves as well.  I am asking this legislative body to please seriously consider this 
parole bill and to demonstrate that rehabilitation is important to the State of Maine 
and the people that represent this state's districts.  Thank you
