LD 178
I favor LD 178 and ask that the Committee vote favorably on it. The Commission that
recommended the readoption of parole in Maine has spent great time and energy 
studying the issue. Their findings and recommendations are compelling. There will 
still be many hurdles for incarcerated people to gain their release and if they are able 
to overcome those hurdles, they should be given another chance to live peacefully and
peaceably in society.  Thank you for your consideration.
