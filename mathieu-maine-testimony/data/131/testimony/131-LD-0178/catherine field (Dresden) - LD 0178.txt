LD 178
As a retired high school teacher and a many-year member of the recovering 
community in Maine, I have seen first hand the human and community benefits of 
supervised and guided re-entry. The opportunity to participate in, and contribute to, 
society is an investment in the individual, and pays dividends to families and society 
on a human and financial level. I urge passage of LD178.
