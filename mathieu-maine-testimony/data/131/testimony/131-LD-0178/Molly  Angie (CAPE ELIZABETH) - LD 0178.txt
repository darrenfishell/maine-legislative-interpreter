LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Molly Angie and I am a resident of Cape Elizabeth, ME.
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill because I believe that all people have worth and that those 
imprisoned should have the right to strive towards healing and rehabilitation with the 
correct resources. Imprisoning people is expensive. I'd much rather see my tax dollars
put towards education and rehabilitation than simply housing criminals without the 
incentive for growth and reconciliation, which parole can provide. 
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
