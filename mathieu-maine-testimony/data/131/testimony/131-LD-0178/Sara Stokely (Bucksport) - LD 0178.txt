I am writing on behalf of supporting  parole. I believe that everyone should have the same rights 
state to state to request parole and have programs to help individuals reenter into a community. 
I was a Maine resident for 43 years and I still have a house in Maine. and have a daughter in 
MCC. Her being in a prison has mentally and emotionally put me right there with her. I know I’m 
not the only parent who feels this way, especially good, caring parents.I have relocated to 
Tennessee a few years ago and have worked with individuals in the Knoxville area who were 
chronically arrested, and also a few individuals reentering into a community who have mental 
illness. As a social worker I helped support individuals in the courts as well as help assist in 
housing and resources to make these individuals transition successful. I believe caring 
individuals also enrich other individuals just by showing someone cares. Many individuals have 
nobody to love and support them, which can also be at fault of their own, or just not have any 
support at all. I do believe that many individuals are sometimes lost, on drugs when doing 
crimes and are not the same people once they are in jail or prison due to no access to drugs 
and sobriety, on the other end, I do believe that some individuals are just very sick who will 
never be  able to change. I do also believe that inside the jails can either be good and learn 
from your behavior or bad, as  I have heard many times of CO’s making things worse  and very 
few caring ones. While I do understand that people who commit crimes have made poor choices 
to be there, I do also believe that CO’s  should be doing a job professionally as these people are 
there serving their time.
