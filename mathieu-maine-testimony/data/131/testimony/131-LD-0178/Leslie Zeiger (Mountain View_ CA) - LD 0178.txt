LD 178
Hello Senators and Representatives,
I am writing in strong support of LD 178 to bring back parole in Maine.
As a preschool teacher, I have always known that people (young and old) deserve 
second chances. And, as a social justice organizer who has worked on campaigns to 
stop LWOP (life without parole) sentences, I know that an LWOP sentence is 
equivalent to a slow death sentence. Maine is a state that claims to oppose capital 
punishment, and yet, the lack of parole makes every life sentence that courts deal out 
is a death sentence.
Please vote yes on LD 178.
Thank you,
Leslie Zeiger
