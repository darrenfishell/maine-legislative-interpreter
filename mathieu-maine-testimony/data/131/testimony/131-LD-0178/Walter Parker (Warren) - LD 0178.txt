Walter Parker
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Walter Parker and I am writing in support of LD 178.
First and foremost, I would like to thank the committee for working tirelessly on this 
parole bill.
Parole is a privilege, not something granted on personal achievements, but through 
true inner change.
I have seen quite a few inmates doing the programs that they choose to do, like for 
example programs like Houses of Healing, Thinking for a Change, AA, NA, Cage 
Your Rage, and Building a Better Life. And there are a few inmates that I met at the 
beginning of my incarceration that have changed themselves in their time here for the 
better. And also, there are some inmates that don't do what they should be doing, they 
just sit around and play games and watch tv, and think and do all the wrong instead of
all the right things that they should be to help themselves, their families, and their 
peers. 
So, when and if parole does come back to Maine, they should look really close at all 
inmates that have done the time to earn parole and make sure that they have also done
what is necessary for them to leave on parole. But there are a few inmates in here 
doing time that I've met when I first started my time here at the Maine State Prison 
that I thought would never be considered to be a different person than what they were 
then. Now, years later, due to the programs and help that they have gotten in here, I 
am shocked to see them now. For instance, Julian Soto, me and him could not stand 
each other and he has done a lot of changes in his time here and has been helping me 
change myself and we now like each other and get along.
I feel that the right inmates can make a difference.
Thank you for taking your time and concern in this matter.
