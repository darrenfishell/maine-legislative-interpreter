Robert Bach
North Haven
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Dr. Robert Bach and I am a resident of North Haven Maine.
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I have been a volunteer for the hospice team at the Maine State for the past ten years which 
was started by Kandyce Powell RN many years ago
I have been very impressed by the men’s  dedication, transparency, and eagerness to 
further their education
These are men are ready to lead productive lives.
Many are majoring in the social sciences and want to help the cause of restorative 
justice.
The following poem may convey that passing this bill is the “right thing to do”
 
      Prison Volunteers
 
The hospice team is welcoming
Their commitment serious
In a monastic tradition
They learn to live with the self
 
Stripped of all material things
Stripped of any social status
 
These men decide to transform
Their time used for redemption
 
I find humility and honesty
I find transparency and kindness
 
Their teacher, Kandyce, empowers
No one left in a shell
 
Discussions deep, questions abound
“What do you think? they ask
Friendships deepen, a bonding forms
I leave with a hug, I love these men
 
A shining light of restorative justice
The world needs to know
 
                   Your friend,
                            Bob
Respectfully,

Bob
