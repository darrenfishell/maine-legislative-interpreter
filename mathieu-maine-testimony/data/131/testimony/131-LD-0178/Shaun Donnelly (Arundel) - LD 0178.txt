LD

"An
Act
to
Support
Reentry
and
Reintegration
into
the
Community"
Senator
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety
Committee,
my
name
is
Shaun
Donnelly ,
and
I’m
a
resident
of
Arundel
I
am
writing
today
in
strong
support
of
LD
178.
Not
only
do
I
feel
that
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
by
incarcerated
Mainers
who
have
demonstrated
meaningful
progress,
but
these
are
also
people
who
are
desperately
needed
at
home
in
their
communities.
Small
businesses
in
the
towns
around
me,
like
many
other
places
in
Maine,
have
been
struggling
for
years
to
hire
workers.
Most
businesses
in
Kennebunkport
would
open
for
longer
hours
if
they
could
find
the
staf f
to
do
so,
substantially
increasing
the
amount
of
economic
activity
each
summer .
It
makes
no
logical
sense
for
our
state
to
spend
millions
of
dollars
continuing
to
lock
up
folks
who
a
panel
of
experts
would
otherwise
determine
to
be
worthy
of
supervised
release.
The
sooner
we
reintegrate
these
Mainers,
the
more
likely
their
lives
are
to
improve
and
be
able
to
positively
impact
their
communities.
Additionally ,
the
possibility
of
an
earlier
release
will
of fer
hope
to
imprisoned
Mainers,
incentivizing
them
to
take
more
positive
steps
that
will
prepare
them
for
rejoining
society .
Maine
is
no
safer
today
than
when
it
did
away
with
parole
in
1976,
and
we
are
desperately
in
need
of
more
Mainers
to
do
their
part
and
move
our
state
forward.
Thank
you
for
all
your
work
on
this
issue,
and
I
hope
that
you
will
vote
ought
to
pass
on
LD
178.

I am writing today in strong support of LD 178. Not only do I feel that it is the right 
thing to do by incarcerated Mainers who have demonstrated meaningful progress, but 
these are also people who are desperately needed at home in their communities. Small
businesses in the towns around me, like many other places in Maine, have been 
struggling for years to hire workers. Most businesses in Kennebunkport would open 
for longer hours if they could find the staff to do so, substantially increasing the 
amount of economic activity each summer.
It makes no logical sense for our state to spend millions of dollars continuing to lock 
up folks who a panel of experts would otherwise determine to be worthy of 
supervised release. The sooner we reintegrate these Mainers, the more likely their 
lives are to improve and be able to positively impact their communities. Additionally, 
the possibility of an earlier release will offer hope to imprisoned Mainers, 
incentivizing them to take more positive steps that will prepare them for rejoining 
society.
Maine is no safer today than when it did away with parole in 1976, and we are desperately in 
need of more Mainers to do their part and move our state forward. Thank you for all your work
on this issue, and I hope that you will vote ought to pass on LD 178.
