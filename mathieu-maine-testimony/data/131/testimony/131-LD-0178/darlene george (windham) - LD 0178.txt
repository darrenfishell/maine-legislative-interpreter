 My name is Darlene George I'm currently housed at Maine Correctional Center for 
woman I'm what you call a long timer here, I have served 14 yrs of a 40 yr sentence.  
I have been actively working with the community here as an Recovery Coach, 
Teaching Classes, Mentoring, Helping Woman obtain their Hisets, & taking classes 
myself. I'm in favor of Parole one day I will be released into society it would be great 
to be able to continue contributing to society while living a better life. It cost the state 
an estimated $78K to house residents in the prison, it will cost a fraction of that to 
monitor someone on parole. There has been no women that have had a long sentence 
come back into the system once released. Please really consider parole and all the 
wonderful things that can come out of it.
