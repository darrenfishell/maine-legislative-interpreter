Dear Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee,
I’m Richard Stahursky and I was given a life sentence in Maine which is 9999 years. I’m 
writing this to you today not asking that you overlook the crime that I’ve committed but instead
to ask that you give me another chance to right some of the wrongs I’ve done. How I plan on 
doing so is by working with young people out 
there to prevent them from making all of the same mistakes and bad choices I’ve made in my 
life. Given the chance I will show you and the community that there’s more to me than bad 
headlines and bad choices. I don’t just want to do this, I need to do this for myself, my family, 
my kids, my niece and for those in the legal system who think that I will never be able to 
change or 
do good things in the community. Those who know me know that I’m a natural leader and I 
can make a big difference. I’ve been in 
prison now for 21 years and in that time I’ve seen many people, even those convicted as sex 
offenders, being given chance after chance and going out in the community where they 
repeat the same mistakes over and over again and never learn from their errors. I’m not here 
to ask for a chance after chance, I’m only asking for one chance. I’ve learned so much being 
incarcerated, I 
have so much to share, to teach and to prevent others from 
becoming incarcerated. I’m not the same young kid who thought he had the answers to 
everything when I first walked through these gates in 2002. Please allow me another chance 
to help others as well as myself. Thank you for your time. 
Respectfully,
Richard Stahursky
