I currently work in the Juvenile Justice System helping teachers to educate the 
students that come into our care. I can see clearly how many of our students' poor 
choices were the result of the environment they grew up in and the narrow options 
presented to them if they want to progress and be successful in life. I have also seen 
how they can change when given the right structure, support and care. We have 
students who were not going to school before coming to us leave with high school, 
technical and associates degrees. They learn to be leaders, community members and 
caring individuals. 
This process of transformation can be true for any individual, youth or adult and in 
the end is what we all want to be the result of our criminal justice system. Parole 
would provide a structure to allow those who have worked hard to transform 
themselves to go back to their communities and contribute to their betterment. Not 
only would it lessen the burden on  the system itself, it will reunite families,  
strengthen communities and improve the economy of the state. The current plan 
addresses potential pitfalls and thoughtfully provides a path forward for those in our 
society who have overcome the circumstances leading to their crimes to come out on 
the other side as better people. The purpose of justice is not punishment, but the 
creation of unity. This bill allows for that purpose to be realized.
