I am for Parole.
I feel it would be beneficial for the people of Maine and for those who’ve been long 
incarcerated and well-deserving of parole.
I’ve been a volunteer at Maine State Prison for some 25 years. I’ve experienced much growth
and insight (for myself) and on the part of the men I’ve met in our meetingbrook 
conversations.
I believe the men who qualify for parole would be an asset to the community.
