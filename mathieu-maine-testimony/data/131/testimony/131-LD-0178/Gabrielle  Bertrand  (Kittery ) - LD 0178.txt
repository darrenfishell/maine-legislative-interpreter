LD 178
Greetings members of the committee. I am writing to urge your consideration and 
support of LD 178. By now, in 2023, we have gathered enough research, testimony 
and evidence that incarceration creates undue additional trauma to individuals who 
have erred. Allowing non-violent offenders to reintegrate into the community 
provides a non-traumatizing environment for individuals to continue their 
rehabilitation while re-building their life as a productive, taxpaying citizen. While this
option lowers the burden on the taxpayers, it is not only an economic decision that we
consider, it is a humanitarian one. Offering hope and belief in the community support 
and in the individual's ability and desire to rehabilitate and learning through a parole 
program allows people the choice to make a change in their life. As a mother and a 
teacher, I have seen many individuals mistakes's nearly disrupt their life; offering an 
option to restore and move in a new direction has made ALL the difference.
