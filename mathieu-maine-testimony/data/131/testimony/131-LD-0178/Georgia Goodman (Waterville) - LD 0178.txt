Hello.
I would like to see parole brought back in Maine. I think that we should offer a 
second chance for incarcerated peoples in Maine because of all of the positive effects 
of parole.
More importantly, the incredible work being done, especially in MSP, is centered 
around growth and healing. It is widely studied and understood that from the 
perspective of a person who has experienced harm, the most effective healing is 
seeing the person who committed the harm grow, reflect and change. In something 
like the Earned Living Unit in MSP- a logical next step would be parole. That would 
allow for people who have done real work to be rewarded and continue to make 
change in the world.
I push for parole to be included in the criminal justice system in Maine.
Thank you for your consideration.
