LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and other distinguished 
members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
I am a citizen of Belfast and a retired family doctor writing in support of LD 178, “An
Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the Community,” which will allow a 
panel of experts to determine if an incarcerated person who has served 1/3 of their 
unsuspended sentence, or if sentenced for life at least 20 years, can, if approved by 
the panel and in consideration of victims’ input, finish their sentence supervised in the
community rather than in prison. 
The lack of resentencing, parole, and commutation options means incarcerated people who 
have demonstrated their ability to lead safe and law-abiding lives outside prison walls are not 
allowed to return and contribute to our communities prior to the conclusion of their sentences.
 
Keeping people who can be law-abiding and contributing community members serves no 
financial, public safety, or rehabilitative purpose and maintains the emphasis in our 
sentencing laws on punishment and incarceration over rehabilitation, restoration, and reentry.
 
A vital step in fulfilling the Maine Department of Corrections' mission of “Making our 
communities safer by reducing harm through supportive intervention, empowering change 
and restoring lives” can be achieved by bringing back parole for Maine. It makes sense for 
everyone.
Sincerely,
Tim Hughes, M.D.
