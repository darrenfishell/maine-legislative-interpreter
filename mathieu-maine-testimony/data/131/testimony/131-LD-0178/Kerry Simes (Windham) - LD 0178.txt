Ladies and Gentleman, I am writing to let you know where I, myself stand with my opinion 
with how you vote on the parole bill. I can honestly say for me it doesn't directly affect me in a 
way of me having to go before the board, but I have friends and ones that I consider family 
who it will affect and I feel that should get that second chance to go back into their 
communities and show that they have been rehabilitated. These women that I am in with 
have been dealt a very sour hand. Most of them have been victims of sexual, emotional and 
mental abuse. They have payed their price for what they have done, and if they haven't done 
enough time they will do the right amount of time and they need to have some sort of hope. 
These women and the men too are not just sitting idle for the most part. I know that almost 
every long timer I interact with on a daily basis is either working with-in the facility or going to 
school, and some of them are doing both. These men and women need to have that ONE 
person that gives them hope and believes in them, just like I do and I have now found. So 
please listen to these testimonies, not just with your ears, but also with your hearts. I want 
you to also think outside the box, I know that people in general do like change, but sometimes
to grow as a State and community then somethings need to change to make that happen. I 
believe in my whole heart that parole is what is going to make more jobs and bring the 
economy back to a level that Maine is desperately in need of, by have these men and women
be able to come home in a reasonable time frame and be our next CEO's or just laborer's if 
they so choose. 
                                                              Thank you
