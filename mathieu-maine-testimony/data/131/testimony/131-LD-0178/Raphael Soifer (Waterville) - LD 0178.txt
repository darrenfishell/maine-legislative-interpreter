Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Raphael Soifer and I am a resident of Waterville, where I work as a 
Visiting Assistant Professor at Colby College. 
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
As an researcher specializing in community-based artistic practices, and a long-time 
facilitator of theatre education programs in prisons throughout Brazil and the United 
States, I have seen firsthand the how increased access to educational resources can 
support incarcerated persons in transforming their lives. The important work being 
done here in Maine both by employees of the Department of Corrections, as well as 
outside volunteers shows how incarcerated individuals can turn their lives around and 
contribute to local communities. I believe that the people of Maine would be best 
served by reintroducing parole so as to allow incarcerated people the opportunity to 
rejoin and give back to their communities.
