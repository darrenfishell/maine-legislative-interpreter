Tia Ludwick
Maine Department Of Corrections
LD 178
I feel parole would not only be beneficial for the women and men here at my facility 
but it would specifically benefit me. My name is Tia Ludwick, I  am 30 years old and 
I am currently incarcerated at MCC. During my incarceration I have done murals, 
work full time at the industries program for the past year, been helpful to my peers. I 
am also a fulltime college student, and I also meet with various groups through the 
prison to talk about being incarcerated. I have interacted with multiple tour groups 
and have worked very hard to better myself. Parole would ultimately be life changing 
for me, my grandmother is elderly and I would really like the chance to go home and 
take care of her with my grandfather passing in the past year. I am away from my 
fianc√©, my mom, stepdad and brother, and have missed all of my cousins and nieces 
growing up. I am currently half way through my 17 year sentence and have always 
maintained I need to serve a penance for a tragedy that happened. Parole would allow 
me to truly atone karmatically for a mistake. I fully believe that I would be better to 
pay my debt to society as a functioning member of the community, one who pays 
taxes and can use their art to teach at risk young adults how to use creativity to take a 
different path. The DOC has helped me develop this skill of using art to heal, and I 
would relish the opportunity to share it with the world.
