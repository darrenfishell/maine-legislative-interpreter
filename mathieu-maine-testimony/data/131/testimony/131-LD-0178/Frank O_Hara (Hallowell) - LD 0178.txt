Testimony in Support of LD 178, An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration in the Community

Senator Anne Beebe-Center, Representative Suzanne Salisbury, Members of the Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety:
I am Frank O’Hara, and am writing to express my support for LD 178, An Act to Support Reentry and 
Reintegration in the Community.  By way of background, I am a longtime resident of Hallowell, a retired 
community development and housing planner, and member of the Social Justice Commission of St. 
Michael’s Parish.
This issue has been well-studied, and I have no arguments to add that you haven’t read in the study 
commission’s report.  All I can add is that it is long past time to act.  Can’t we all acknowledge at this 
point that Maine’s policy of putting people in jail for extended periods of time, then releasing them 
without skills or resources into unprepared communities isn’t working?  It’s a waste of taxpayer 
dollars, as the commission has pointed out.   But much more importantly, it is a waste of human 
potential.  
We can do better.  We can prepare offenders for meaningful work and income after their release.  But it 
takes planning and community and business involvement before the day of release; or put another 
way, it takes parole.
Maine is fortunate in having a talented Commissioner of Corrections in Randy Liberty, whom I am 
sure will do a good job in implementing this program.  It’s time to stop talking and start acting.  Pass 
this bill and get the program going in the coming year.  Maine will be the better for it.
Thank you.
Frank O'Hara
