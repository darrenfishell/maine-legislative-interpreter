LD 178
Dear members of Maine Legislative, 
I would like to enter a personal testimony in support of LD178. Maine's prison system is up 
and coming, we all see this. However, it does not mean that the system is perfect. We are 
spending millions of taxpayers' dollars on incarceration, instead using a small portion of the 
funds on parole. If  Maine would reinstate parole, we would save money but also increase the
number of taxpayers contributing to the state of Maine through employment. The men and 
women who would be eligible for parole would be the most upstanding model inmates. Those 
who have proven to be rehabilitated with a strong desire to live life on the right side of the 
street. To be honest, I am sick of seeing all of the funds going into fancy prisons when many 
of the people could thrive in our communities while keeping Maine safe. I struggle to see the 
sense in not trying something that many states are doing. Maine has improved their prison 
systems but have not budged on offering parole. Please look past decade old mistakes and 
move forward into a brighter future for ALL of Maine. 
Respectfully, Martha Wilkins
