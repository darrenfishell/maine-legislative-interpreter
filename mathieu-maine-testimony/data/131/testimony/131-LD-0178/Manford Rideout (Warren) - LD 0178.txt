Manford Rideout
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Manford Rideout and I am writing in support of LD 178.
Please consider this brief testimony in favor of LD178, a bill to reinstate parole in 
Maine. I am an incarcerated resident and would really appreciate the chance to make 
parole and safely reenter my community.
With your vote, you have the ability to write a wrong made in 1976. When Maine 
abolished parole, it left a gap of services and made our communities unsafe with 
incarcerated men and women leaving prison with zero supports.
I believe this bill would change that. Thank you for your support.
