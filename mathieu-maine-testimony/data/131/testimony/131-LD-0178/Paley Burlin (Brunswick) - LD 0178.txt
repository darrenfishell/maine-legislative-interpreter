LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the criminal justice 
and public safety committee, my name is Paley Burlin.  I am a resident of Brunswick 
and a licensed mental health professional. I volunteer at Maine State Prison providing 
emotional healing circles to inmates through a non-profit organization known as 
Jericho Circle. I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and
the effort to re-establish parole in Maine. 
I support this bill because it gives a second chance to those who have made big 
mistakes.  The Alliance for Safety and Justice did a national survey of crime survivors
which showed that victims wanted rehabilitation rather than punishment for those 
who harmed them by a 2 to 1 margin.  Most of society believes our criminal justice 
system is broken and in need of reform.  Re-instituting parole would be a big step in 
that direction.  I work with men in prison who are earnestly committed to improving 
themselves as people, learning emotional coping skills and empathy, and supporting 
other inmates to improve their own lives. These men need a pathway to return to 
society. 
It also saves tax payers money to reinstitute parole. 
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
