I am in favor of parole being offered to eligible incarcerated people. Statistics show 
that incarceration reduces public safety rather than increasing it, and incarceration is 
very expensive. Having the option of parole would also give incarcerated folks more 
hope, and something to work towards. We should invest in our communities and 
people rather than fund more incarceration. Though I live across the country, I believe
that investing in our communities across the United States will result in more public 
safety, and this includes folks who have done their time, rehabilitated themselves, and
are excited to contribute to their communities again.
