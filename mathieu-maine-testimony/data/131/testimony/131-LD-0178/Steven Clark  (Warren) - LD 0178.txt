Testimony of Steven Matthew Clark
LD 178 An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the Community
March 13th, 2023
Maine Criminal Justice Committee 
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice Committee,
My name is Steven Matthew Clark and I am writing to express my strong support for the LD 178 
an Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration. This bill would reinstate parole in Maine, a critical 
step in ensuring that individuals like myself who have worked hard to rehabilitate and transform 
our lives would have the opportunity to rejoin society as productive and become contributing 
members.
I have been incarcerated for the past 18 years, and during this time, I have worked hard to better 
myself and to contribute positively to the lives of others. I have earned an associate’s degree, two 
Bachelor’s degrees, a Master’s degree, and am currently working towards a PhD. I am also a 
volunteer, tutor, and recovery support specialist, and have worked with over 1500 people to help 
them on their path to recovery and reentry.
Additionally, I have earned several professional certifications, and have made valuable 
connections with people who want to support me in my efforts to be a contributing member of 
society upon my release. I have even met the woman who I hope to spend my life with, and I 
have a place to live.
I share all of this with you to emphasize the progress that can be made when incarcerated 
individuals are given the opportunity to work towards a better future. I am a prime example of 
what can be achieved with dedication, hard work, and support.
Despite all of the progress I have made, I still face the harsh reality that without parole, I may 
never have the chance to rejoin society. I have met the woman I hope to spend my life with and 
want to help my family and other individuals in prison find love and the encouragement to 
change. It is clear that more prison time is not the solution, and that the path to true rehabilitation 
and reentry is through support and the chance to prove ourselves..
However, despite my achievements, I remain incarcerated, unable to fully utilize my skills and 
talents to make a positive impact on society. I strongly believe that reinstating the parole system 
in Maine would provide individuals like myself with the opportunity to be released from prison 
under supervision, and to continue our work towards rehabilitation and transformation outside of 
prison walls.
After spending years rehabilitating myself and transforming my life, I believe that more prison is 
not the solution. Rather, the solution is to let me be out and to be a contributing member of 
society who pays taxes, helps his family, and even helps my victim’s mother the best I can. 
If I were to be granted parole, it would mean the world to me. After spending nearly two decades 
in prison, I have transformed myself into a better person, with a new outlook on life, and a desire 
to contribute to society in a meaningful way. I am ready to put my education and experience to 
work, helping others and giving back to my community.
More than anything, I want to reconnect with my family and make up for lost time. I have missed 
so many important moments with my loved ones, and I am eager to rebuild those relationships 
and create new memories with them. I also have the opportunity to start a new life with the 
woman I love, and I am ready to take on the responsibility of being a supportive partner and 
contributing member of our community.
I understand that parole is not a guarantee of freedom, but I am willing to do whatever it takes to 
prove that I am a worthy candidate for release. I am committed to continuing my education and 
personal growth, and to using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world. I 
hope that you will consider reinstating parole in Maine, and that I will have the chance to show 
you that I am ready to be a productive member of society once again.
When I am released, I plan to use my lived experience of incarceration to help others who are 
currently incarcerated or who have recently been released. As someone who has spent 18 years 
in prison, I understand the struggles and challenges that people face when they are incarcerated, 
and I also know firsthand how difficult it can be to adjust to life outside of prison.
As a consultant and teacher, I would draw on my personal experiences to help others navigate 
the complex and often confusing process of reentry. I would work with individuals to identify 
their strengths and skills and help them develop a plan for achieving their goals. I would also 
provide practical advice on everything from finding housing and employment to accessing 
healthcare and social services.
In addition to one-on-one consulting, I would also like to develop educational programs to help 
people in prison and their families. These programs would be designed to provide practical 
information and guidance on a range of topics, from financial literacy and career development to 
mental health and addiction recovery.
Ultimately, my goal would be to help people who are currently incarcerated or who have recently 
been released to not only survive but thrive. By sharing my own experiences and insights, I hope 
to inspire and empower others to make positive changes in their lives and become active and 
engaged members of their communities.
I urge you to support LD 178 and to reinstate the parole system in Maine. Doing so would 
provide hope and opportunity for individuals who have worked hard to rehabilitate themselves, 
and would promote the values of justice and fairness.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
