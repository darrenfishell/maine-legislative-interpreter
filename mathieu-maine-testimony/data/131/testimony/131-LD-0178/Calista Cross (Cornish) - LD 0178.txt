  Criminal justice & public safety committee,
My name is CALISTA CROSS.I have lived in Cornish Maine for 80 years.My 
testimony is for all prisoners, but today is for my nephew, Tracy Meggison, who has 
been in prison for 34 years.He was arrested at the age of 19 & now is 53 for a crime 
he did not commit.
Both his parents, now deceased,& I have worked  with lawyers, reps, all governors 
over the years trying to prove his innocence. You have to be very rich to get anything 
done .
Tracy has shown he is not a threat to society & has been working with hostice & 
helped dying prisoners. He has worked with dog training program for many years.He 
is taking college classes n when he is released from prison ,would like to help those 
on drugs to get a better life.
His job at MSP is helping to dicipline prisoners who need help when  making 
mistakes.
We hear about being a victim ,but well we are all victims no matter whatside you're 
ne. Tracy's family & mine have cried many tears over the last 34 years & we will not 
stop until he comes home.
MAINE needs to make a change to bring back parole & give second chances to those 
who earned it. Tracy Meggison is one who works hard, follows rules & he wants to 
take care of himself outside of prison.Only you can help give TRACY this chance.
Tracy deserves a second chance for he cannot do any better if he stays in prison for 
another eight years as he has found his way. Thanks to the Warden & all those 
involved for taking good care of our children & for making prison life much better 
then before & helping prisoners to get ready for the outside.
Please bring parole back to  give ,TRACY MEGGISON,a second chance in life n 
many others like him.
Thank you Calista
