In 2009 I became the first women in Maine's history to be held in incarnation till 12/31/9999. 
This equates to life without the possibility of parole. For me never getting out of prison is the 
price I pay for what I did. I'm not nor will I ever ask for parole for me. I took a life, I must give 
my life. I must take re3sponsibility for my actions.
I do write on behalf of my incarcerated sisters. The long timers around 20 of them had good 
lives, good families, a home and collage education. No long timer female has ever returned 
back tp prison. All my sisters participate in our prison community trying to represent to the 
short time population that anyone can make one mistake and have our life taken. A big 
mistake for sure. But serving 20 years isn't enough? Why not let my sisters have a second 
chance at life.
Parole was abolished by a man in 1976,  why should we be held captive because this man 
blew it. That is mass punishment at it's largest level. I pray you vote yes for parole.
