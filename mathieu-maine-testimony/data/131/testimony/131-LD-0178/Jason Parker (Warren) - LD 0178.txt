LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Jason Parker and I am writing in support of  LD 178.
First and foremost, I would like to thank the committee for working tirelessly on this 
parole bill.
I'm writing this letter in support of those who will be affected by those who would 
receive parole if they put the work in for their own rehabilitation. There are many 
men here who have been taking programs to better themselves, started their HiSET 
schooling, and have started college courses and went on to graduate with their college
degrees from the University of Maine at Augusta. These men have mentored me and 
facilitated programs that I have taken.
They taught me how to value my life and the life of my own daughter and how to be a
father. The recovery coaches showed me how by selling drugs, I stole relationships 
from parents and their children. I would never have looked at it from the drug usersâ€™ 
perspective if it wasn't for these men showing me my actions and how to be a father 
and how to be a productive citizen in my community.
It's men like that who deserve to receive parole, so they can help the community with 
their mentoring and life coaching skills. 
Thank you very much for taking the time to read this testimony. may God bless you and your 
loved ones.
