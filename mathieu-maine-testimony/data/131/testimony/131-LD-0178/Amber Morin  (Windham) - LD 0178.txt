Re: Testimony on behalf of LD 178
March 13th, 2023
My name is Amber Morin and I am currently incarcerated in Windham Maine. I am writing this
letter as a personal testimony in favor of LD 178. I am fortunate that I am only serving a 
four-year sentence and will be released in 2025. Not all incarcerated people have a release 
date to look forward to. 
When I first became incarcerated, I was completely broken and lost. I lacked self-esteem and 
self-worth. Throughout my experience, I have done tremendous amounts of work to fix the 
flaws within myself. I am proud to say that I now feel worthy and deserve better for myself. I 
have met a lot of amazing people since being incarcerated. There have been many residents 
that acted as mentors and role models for me. I hope that LD 178 will be passed and will let 
these individuals demonstrate their rehabilitation before a parole board. 
I look forward to seeing what Maine can do to transform the reentry community in the future. 
Please support LD 178. 
Respectfully written, 
Amber Morin
