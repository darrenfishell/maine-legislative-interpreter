Over the past year and a half, I have been attending online presentations and seminars
on support and positive growth among prisoners who have chosen educational 
opportunities and who are not the same person they were upon entering prison. I am 
an anthropologist and not an expert, but I have taught in prisons and have seen the 
impacts of losing a family member or parent or good friend to incarceration for life. I 
have witnessed the impacts on families with no hope, especially siblings and children 
who lose faith in the country and who are unable to understand "justice" with zero 
chance for forgiveness. They have lost touch with the concept of what is "human" 
(making mistakes) and have become cynical about the whole justice system as a 
for-profit.The anger and inability to do anything will set the stage for more 
criminality. Please, please support this Act.
