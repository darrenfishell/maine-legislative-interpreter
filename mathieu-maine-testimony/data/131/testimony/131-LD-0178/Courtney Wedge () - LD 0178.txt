Courtney Wedge
LD 178
My name is Courtney Wedge, and I am a resident of Portland, Maine. I've lived in 
Maine my whole life - I grew up in Scarborough, I have family in 
Portland/Westbrook, all the way up to the County, and I don't think I could live 
anywhere else. Maine has that special "something" that makes it "the way life should 
be". Not "the way life should be for some"... which is why I am writing to you today 
to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to re-establish parole in 
Maine.
I support this bill because I believe that, with hard work, time, and a strong will, any person 
can change. 
Before I met my friend, Rosie - whose brother is currently in the system - I didn't know that 
Maine didn't have parole. I always thought that the point of prison was to rehabilitate people 
who had committed crimes, and if those people could show that they took the rehab seriously,
they'd be able to rejoin society (with stipulations). Rosie's brother is one of those people. He's
used his time to better himself, to educate himself, to earn degrees, and is now working on 
his PhD. The system has done it's job - with LD 178... it could finish it by allowing this man to 
reunite with his family and give back to society in a positive way. 
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your support 
for LD 178. 
Courtney Wedge.
