Please bring Parole back to the State od Maine. Steven Clark has been instrumental in 
bringing and implementing programs in which to one can be absorbed back in to society and 
be a productive member. My son is one Steven Clark taught. In turn my son took those 
programs to minimum security to be come part of the prison system curriculum.
These men worked hard to become leaders in thought and action and should be allowed to 
prove themselves as viable human beings.  
The cost to the tax payers for Profit Communities such as Prison systems for viable hard 
working men and women is too much for the state of Maine to bear.
