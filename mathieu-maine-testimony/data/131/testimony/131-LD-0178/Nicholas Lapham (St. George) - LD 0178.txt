Nicholas Lapham
St. George
LD 178
11 March 2023
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Nicholas Lapham and I am a resident of St. George, ME. I have been 
co-facilitating men's circles inside Maine State Prison since 2020 under the auspices 
of Jericho Circle Project which was been conducting men's circles in multiple states 
for the last 20 years.
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill because I have witnessed men who have transformed themselves 
during their incarceration, and believe that some -- certainly not all -- men have 
committed themselves to repairing the harm they have caused and to becoming 
contributing cozens of the communities to which they seek to belong to outside prison
upon their release.  
I further support this bill because I believe there are significant economic and social 
benefits that far outweigh the costs of incarceration for incarcerated persons deemed 
by the appropriate members of the state to be worthy of parole.  
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
