LD 178
Dear members of the Legislative: 
I would like to submit a letter of support for LD 178. As a younger woman, I was 
judgmental and believed all criminals deserved long prison sentences to pay for their 
crimes. My way of thinking was changed after becoming involved in an organization 
that employs incarcerated women from a reentry center. 
I worked with two women for over a year, without realizing they were incarcerated. 
One of the ladies became one of my closest friends. I have learned that people's 
futures are truly not defined by their past mistakes. There are people who deserve 
early release, after rehabilitation and serving a portion of their sentence. 
Maine people should trust the justice system and understand that those being offered 
parole would have to meet a high level of criteria in order to be released into the 
program. I ask you to have faith in people and show compassion for those working 
towards rectifying their wrongs. 
Thank you, Marcia McDonald
