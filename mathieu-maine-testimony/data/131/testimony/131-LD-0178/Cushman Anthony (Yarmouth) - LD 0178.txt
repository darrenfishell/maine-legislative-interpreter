Testimony in Support of LD 178
             Presented by Cushman Anthony
March 13, 2023
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety: My name is Cushman Anthony and I live in Yarmouth. I am 
a Quaker and am a retired lawyer and mediator. I was a member of the House of 
Representatives from 1986 to 1992, and was House Chair of the Select Committee on 
Corrections during the 115th Legislature. 
I wish to add my name to others who will present testimony in support of this bill, which 
will bring back a carefully structured form of parole. In my experience that has been badly 
needed in this state for a long time. I defer to others who will present the statistics and 
research findings that have been gathered in support of this.
 I urge passage of this modest proposal to improve our stateâ€™s corrections system.
Thank you.
