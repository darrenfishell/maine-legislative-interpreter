LD 178
My name is Matthew Bosica and I am a resident of Kingsbridge, England however I 
grew up in Rockland, Maine and still vote in the state of Maine as I keep a residence 
at 163 Ledge Rd, South Thomaston where my mother Alvera Bosica lives.  I am 
writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine. Maine must be compassionate to those who have served 
their time and who would benefit by becoming productive members of society again. 
The benefit is not just for those people who would be released but for the greater 
community of Maine. It is fair to say that Maine's current system which doesn't allow 
parole is neither compassionate nor an exemplar of a progressive society.  Yet, Maine 
in many ways is progressive which is why this bill must become law. Maine must be a
model to both the country and the world in how it treats its incarcerated citizens by 
giving, under the right conditions, the chance for parole. How unfortunate that one 
mistake, no matter how grave, could inspire the hopelessness, that second chances 
aren't possible.  Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I 
can count on your support for LD 178. Yours Sincerely, Matthew Bosica
