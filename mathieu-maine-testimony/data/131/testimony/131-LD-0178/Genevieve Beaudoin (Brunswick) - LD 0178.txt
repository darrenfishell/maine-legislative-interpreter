LD 178
Honorable Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Geneviève Beaudoin, and I am a resident of Brunswick, Maine. I am 
writing today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to re-establish 
parole in Maine. 
I support this bill because I believe Maine needs to offer a pathway that recognizes 
rehabilitation and provides opportunities to contribute to our communities. And I’m 
not alone: consistently in public opinion polling, American citizens overwhelmingly 
say they want reform. According to one ACLU survey, 91% of people - across the 
political spectrum - believe the criminal justice system is broken and needs reform. 
And according to a report by the Alliance for Safety and Justice, 66% of surveyed 
crime survivors said they wanted rehabilitation over punishment. LD 178 is a 
powerful opportunity to create a supportive, restorative, and victim-sensitive parole 
system in Maine. 
I believe public safety is more than locking people away in cages – it is rehabilitating 
citizens to come back and contribute to their communities. I believe justice is more 
than the tough-on-crime bills of a past generation – it is the opportunity to address 
those past harms. Above all, I believe in second chances and the human capacity for 
change. 
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. Please let people who pose 
no risk to public safety come home. I hope to count on your support for LD 178.
