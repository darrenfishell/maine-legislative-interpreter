LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Michelle Sanborn and I am a resident of Springvale. 
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill because I feel like there are many men and women working towards
a positive release via education and work programs within our prisons.
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
