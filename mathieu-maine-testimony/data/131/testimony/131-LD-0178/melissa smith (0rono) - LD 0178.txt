I like so many others have a loved one or a friend in the prison system. my boyfriend is in the 
Maine State Prison with a 50 year sentence, I believe that the families of the residents of the 
prison would love to have a second chance with there loved ones or friends.  It would be 
amazing to help our loved ones work toward parole, to give them some kind of hope. 
I'm asking that you please reconsider the parole bill, it would do great things for the State of 
Maine, the residents and there loved ones.  
Thank you for your time today.
