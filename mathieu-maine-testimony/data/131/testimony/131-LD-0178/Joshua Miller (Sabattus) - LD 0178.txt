LD 178
I am writing to express my support for LD178, An Act to Support Reentry and 
Reintegration into the Community. I strongly believe that reestablishing parole here in
Maine will bring positive effects on public safety, racial justice, taxpayer relief, and 
second chances for individuals and communities.
I’m a licensed social worker, substance use counselor, and have held roles in state 
government and within the private sector that is pertinent pertaining to this topic. I’m 
also in the minority class in Maine, being 50 percent Hispanic coming from a parent 
who was a first generation American. Additionally, I am a person in long-term 
recovery and formerly incarcerated. I recently received a Governor's Pardon in 
Pennsylvania, which will seal my felony 1 conviction and provide me with the 
opportunity to expunge my record. I know firsthand the struggles of reentering into 
the community after incarceration, and I have seen the positive impact of second 
chances on individuals and their families. I highlight this with you to share my 
personal and professional experiences that give me credibility on this subject.
I am kindly asking you to consider the benefits of reestablishing parole in Maine and 
support LD178. This act can create a path to successful reentry and reduce recidivism 
rates. It can also help individuals reintegrate into society, gain employment, and 
contribute positively to their communities. Additionally, taxpayers will benefit from 
reduced costs associated with incarceration.
I appreciate your time and consideration of this matter. I strongly believe that 
supporting LD178 is an opportunity to help people and communities, and I hope you 
will consider my request to support this legislation.
Thank you for your continued dedication to public service.
Sincerely,
Joshua Miller
