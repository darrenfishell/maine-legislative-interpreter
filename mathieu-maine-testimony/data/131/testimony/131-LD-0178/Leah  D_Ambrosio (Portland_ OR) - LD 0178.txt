To Whom It May Concern: I am not a Maine resident but I am close to Steven 
Matthew Clark who is currently incarcerated at the Maine State Prison for 36 years. 
He has served half of his time. In those past 16-18 years, Steven has improved himself
- has received an AA, two BAs and a Masters and is working on his PhD along with 
many other helpful certifications like substance abuse counselor. 
Steven deserves to be out helping our community PREVENT others from going down
the wrong path and becoming incarcerated. We need people like Steven out in the 
community giving hope to people. 
How can we teach our children forgiveness when the example in Maine is if you 
make a mistake there is no forgiveness - only punishment. It also removes hope from 
the incarcerated - why should they try and be better when the system has created odds
against them? 
From the research that is out in the public, there is no downside to bringing back 
parole to Maine. I would hope one of the requirements of parole is to have a degree of
some sort. Even if it's just an AA. We need to have our prisoners educated so they can
see and feel and understand there is a better way. 
Please bring back parole to Maine. Please give these people hope and dignity. Create 
a positive pathway forward. 
I appreciate you time.
