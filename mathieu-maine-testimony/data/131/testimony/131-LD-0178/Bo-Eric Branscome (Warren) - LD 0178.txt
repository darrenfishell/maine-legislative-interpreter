Bo-Eric Branscome
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Bo-Eric Branscome and I am writing in support of parole bill LD178.
I would like to address the possibility of bringing back parole to Maine and what it 
would mean to me and my family. But first, I would like to thank the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee for the hard work and effort to make parole a reality.
First and foremost, I realize that if parole comes back and I am granted parole, I 
would need to have earned it with several factors. 1. My understanding that parole is 
not a given but it is a privilege with a huge responsibility that comes with it, and 2. I 
have taken full accountability and responsibility for the crimes that I have committed 
against my victims and my community. I have taken the Houses of Healing self-help 
program to deal with anger and child trauma issues, and I have completed the 
Residential Substance Use Treatment program while incarcerated here at Maine State 
prison.
If granted parole, I would continue to work hard to repair the damage I have done to my 
victims and their families, as well as my own family and my community. Thank you very much
for taking time out of your busy day to read my testimony.
