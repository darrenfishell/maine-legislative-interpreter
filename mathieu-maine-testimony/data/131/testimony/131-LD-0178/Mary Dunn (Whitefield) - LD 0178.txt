LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Mary Dunn and I am a resident of Whitefield.
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill because keeping someone locked up after they show remorse and 
willingness to do better is not only wrong, itâ€™s expensive. Without parole someone serving jail 
time has no incentive to do better. As a civilized society our goal for jail should be 
rehabilitation to come back to society as a better person than when they went in. Taking away
parole does not accomplish this. 
A close friend spent years in prison for something done in his youth. Prison severely 
traumatized him. He wanted to do better, be better. Parole offers those like him, who grew up 
with trauma at home and made a stupid mistake suffer more than is needed. 
Plus keeping someone in prison who has shown remorse and the desire to do/be better is 
very expensive! Statistics say it is 9 times as expensive to keep someone in prison than to 
monitor them while on parole. This just makes sense to me.
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.

Whitefield, ME
