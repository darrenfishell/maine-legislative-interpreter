Testimony of Rachael Pitts 
LD178
Dear Honorable Members of the Criminal Justice Committee in Maine,
My name is Rachael Pitts, and I am a professional health and wellness coach. I am here today to 
speak in support of LD 178, An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration, and the reinstatement 
of parole in Maine.
As the sister of Steven's fiancée, I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand the remarkable 
transformation he has undergone since his time in prison. Through his commitment to personal 
growth and rehabilitation, Steven has demonstrated that he is deserving of a second chance and 
the opportunity to reintegrate back into society as a productive and contributing member.
As a coach, I have worked with individuals who have been through difficult times, and I have 
seen the positive impact that coaching and support can have on someone's life. Steven is a 
shining example of what is possible when individuals are given the resources and support they 
need to succeed. What is amazing he has become my coach through his master’s program. 
Thanks to his coaching I have had many doors open. Steven is gifted skilled and has too much to 
offer society to keep him locked away. 
Reinstating parole in Maine would provide a crucial mechanism for individuals like Steven to 
receive the support and guidance they need as they navigate the challenges of reentry. By 
granting individuals who have demonstrated a commitment to rehabilitation and personal growth 
the opportunity to reintegrate into society, we can help reduce the burden on the prison system 
and save taxpayer dollars.
According to the Maine Department of Corrections website, the cost of incarceration in Maine is 
estimated to be over $50,000 per person per year. By providing individuals with the support and 
resources they need to successfully reintegrate back into society, we can help reduce the rate of 
recidivism and save taxpayer dollars in the process.
Studies have shown that parole can be an effective tool for reducing recidivism and promoting 
successful reentry. For example, a study conducted by the National Institute of Justice found that 
individuals who were released on parole were 36% less likely to be re-arrested than those who 
were released without supervision.
I believe that LD 178 and the reinstatement of parole in Maine would provide a much-needed 
opportunity for individuals like Steven to continue on their path of personal growth and 
rehabilitation. It would provide a mechanism for these individuals to receive the support and 
guidance they need as they reintegrate back into society, and it would help reduce the burden on 
the prison system and save taxpayer dollars in the process. Steven has a safe space to live when 
he is released and he will be surrounded by my family who are psychologists, doctors, nurses, 
and overall good people. Steven’s incarceration affects my sister deeply and we all want Steven 
to come home. Steven will be surrounded by love and too many good people that he would ever 
end up in any trouble.  We all love Steven and want to see him home. 
In closing, I urge the members of this committee to support LD 178 and the reinstatement of 
parole in Maine. Let us give people who have transformed their lives a second chance to make a 
positive contribution to society.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Rachael Pitts
