Hazel Mae Bouchard
LD 178
Dear Honorable Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee;
I am writing this letter to express my wholehearted support for the release of my Son 
Jeremy Austin Clement inmate #51669.
My name is Hazel Mae Bouchard if my son were paroled I know he would be a model
citizen. Jeremy & I have talked on the phone countless times. We have planned for 
him to include me on his visits with his parole officer & any other meetings that are 
required of him. Jeremy wants to have total transparency with me & his parole officer
at all times. I will be able to transport him to all of his appointments with no issues.
Jeremy already has a job when he gets out & they will be happy he is back. Jeremy & 
I have planned for him to help me here at the house when he gets out. My health has 
not been good since he left. Jeremy is the glue that keeps things together here. 
We as a family are going to build him his own home eventually. We have lawns to 
mow, fields to bushhog  trees to cut & out buildings to jack up. Things that Jeremy 
loves to do here are plentiful. 
We are planning for Jeremy to be able to spend time with the family here with picnics
& bbq. I have lost a lot of time with my son & we would love the opportunity to try to
make that time up. 
Sincerely,
Hazel Mae Bouchard
