LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Kevin J Robinson and I am writing in support of  LD 178.
I would like to address parole and the possibility of it being granted to me. Parole is a 
privilege, not something that is granted to me on frivolous merits or personal 
achievements. Since I have been incarcerated, I have learned to manage my way of 
thinking from negative thinking to a positive way of thinking, with the guidance of 
my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. As I walk down this path of righteousness, I work to
inspire others by showing and living a positive example to inspire them to want to live
a positive life as well, in other words I lead by example.
For the past five and a half years I have devoted myself to staying out of trouble with 
no disciplinary write-ups. I am a mentor and peer coach at Maine State Prison for the 
“Awakening Wellness” program. I am also a Nutritionist giving my fellow residents a
healthier way to eat, as well as a Personal Trainer leading cardiovascular exercise 
classes. Since 2022, I have held a position as the Lead of Vegetarian Liaison in MSP's
Kitchen. I also am the Head Cook for the Rastafarian religious meals and have been 
working in the kitchen since 2018.
Since 2018, I have begun and completed various programs. (see below). On October 
29th, 2018, I began a Bible study through the Global University School for 
Evangelism and Discipleship to receive my certificate to become an ordained 
Minister. In April 2019, I began the high school equivalency test (HiSET) and I will 
be completing the program and graduating in Fall of 2023.
If granted parole, I'm looking to get into drug counseling to take responsibility for 
trafficking narcotics, to help those who have substance use disorder. I will start my 
Health Food Business promoting vegetarian, pescatarian, and vegan meal options and 
continuing my Personal Fitness training to offer my community more options for 
healthier lifestyle. Lastly, I'm seeking to invest in a low-income apartment building to
provide affordable housing to those struggling with poverty.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read this testimony. May God bless you 
and your loved ones.
