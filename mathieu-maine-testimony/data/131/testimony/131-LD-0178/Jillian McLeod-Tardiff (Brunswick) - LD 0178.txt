LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Jillian McLeod-Tardiff and I am a resident of Brunswick. 
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine. I support this bill because I believe that everyone, no 
matter their criminal history, deserves fair and just treatment, and that should include 
parole.
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
