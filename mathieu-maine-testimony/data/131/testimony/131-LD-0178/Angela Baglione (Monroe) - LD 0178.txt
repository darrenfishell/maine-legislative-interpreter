LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Angela Baglione and I am a resident of Monroe, ME. I am a farmer and business 
owner, and have been involved in activism for many years. 
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill because healthy communities are built on empathy and understanding of 
each other's humanity. It is inhumane to incarcerate people without parole, and supporting 
people in reintegration after incarceration will make our state stronger on both interpersonal 
and systemic levels. 
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your support 
for LD 178.
