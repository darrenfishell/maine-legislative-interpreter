LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee,
My name is Buddy Robinson and I am a resident of Maine State prison.
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill because I see men every day that have made mistakes but those same men
have strived to better themselves and others. I am a veteran that came back from the desert 
broken and not right, there are over 100 men like myself in this prison that came back and did
not get the help that they deserved and needed. Some veterans came back physically broken
and became addicted to certain meds, some men came back with severe PTSD and still 
suffer to this day. However i see these men pushing forward every day in order to prove that 
they are better men. I myself work in the industries program and in my off time, i help to train 
service dogs, I have volunteered with the hospice program and sat with men as they passed 
in order to give them dignity and I am also the post commander for our American Legion Post.
I am one of many that would not only benefit with getting out of prison but society as a whole 
would as well.
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
