LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representive Salsbury, and members of the criminal Justice 
and Safety Committee,
My name is Jonathan Michaelson I am a resident of Bath Maine.
I am writing to show my support for LD 178 and to bring parole to Maine. 
I support parole in Maine because I believe that anyone that puts in the effort to make 
personal changes to better themselves deserves an opportunity to live that change. I 
believe that we all need hope for a better world and we cannot forget that incarcerated
individuals are part of that world and they need hope as well. Taking the steps to go to
substance abuse programs, going to classes to learn job-related skills, and the journey 
of self-reflection to realize that real personal change must happen should not go 
unnoticed.
Let us show compassion, and understanding and bring hope to those that chose the 
path of rehabilitation and bring parole to Maine.
