I'm writing to ask you to bring back parole in the state of Maine.
I know several people who were formerly incarcerated who are strong members of 
their community today. Every day that a child is separated from a parent takes a huge 
toll on those kids (as well as adult children of incarcerated people).
As someone who has been a victim of violent crime, I do not believe that locking 
people up for long periods of time does anything to help victims heal or to help 
people on the inside get better. If the point of prison is to eventually rehabilitate 
people, parole is a tool to help us get there faster.
Lastly, it also makes financial sense. It is 9 times more expensive to incarcerate 
someone than to supervise them on parole. Experts estimate a $14.7M boost to 
Maineâ€™s economy for every 100 people granted parole.
Do the right thing and bring back parole.
