As a philosopher, I think, teach, and write about justice and forgiveness. Historically, 
philosophers who have tried to think carefully about how justice in a society should 
function argue that people can change, and that community support for positive 
change is crucial. Parole is a crucial part of making that possibility for change real. 
From a human psychological standpoint, it makes sense that the possibility of earlier 
reentry into one's community would motivate the kind of change that can heal an 
individual and their community. As a human being, I can't imagine knowing that 
proving my remorse for something I regretted would have no effect on my life. 
Reinstating parole would help achieve more justice in our justice system. I support 
this Act for Reentry and Reintegration wholeheartedly.
