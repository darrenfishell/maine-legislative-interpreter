LD 178
I would like to add my voice to the many who support LD 178, because we want to 
bring back parole to the Maine criminal justice system. Evidence suggests that a 
supervised release from prison helps an incarcerated person make a better transition to
public life, something which not only would help that individual but the community 
as well. It is simply the right thing to do; itâ€™s high time we act on it.
