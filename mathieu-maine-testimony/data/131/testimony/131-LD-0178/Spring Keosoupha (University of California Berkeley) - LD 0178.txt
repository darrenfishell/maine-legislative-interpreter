LD 178
Over the last 4 years my husband and I have corresponded with Stephen Clark, who 
currently resides in Maine State Prison. Stephen has made an extreme impact on our 
lives. He has encouraged me to go back to college to pursue a degree in Social Work 
from the University of California Berkeley, and my husband has started a 5-year 
program with the Electrical Apprenticeship Union. We have gained hope and 
positivity through our participation in the online group that Stephen runs, called the 
Awaken Exchange. The group is held monthly to promote healing, connection, and 
spirituality. These connections have enabled us to persevere through challenging 
times. Stephen has provided counsel by spreading the powerful message of God. I 
truly believe that he is a changed man. I pray that Maine institutes LD 178 so that 
people like Stephen can have a second chance after serving many years in prison. I 
believe that people who are making a positive contribution to society should be given 
the chance for parole. I strongly support LD 178.
