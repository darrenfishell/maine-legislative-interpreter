LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee:
My name is Ellen Grunblatt and I am a resident of Jay. I'm a retired physician, a 
therapist in private practice, and a member of the Franklin County Detention Center 
Board of Visitors.  I'm writing in support of LD 178, the effort to reestablish parole in
Maine.
In a rural state like Maine those who are incarcerated are members of our 
communities.Although Maine’s incarceration rate is half that of the US, it is greater 
than that of most advanced democracies. This fact is shocking and shameful, and it’s 
so much more than just a number. In a rural state like Maine those who are 
incarcerated are members of our communities. We know their families; we know their
struggles, which often include poverty, mental illness and substance use disorder. We 
know the children who suffer from the absence of a parent and the loss of that 
parent’s potential income. Prolonged incarceration is a solution to none of these 
problems. Incarceration itself exacerbates mental illness; it can increase exposure to 
substance abuse. Treatment of mental illness and substance use disorder while 
incarcerated, when it is available, is expensive for the taxpayer and divorced from 
community resources. Detention facilities are overburdened and understaffed and not 
equipped to manage these challenges. Reducing incarceration by making parole 
available when safe and appropriate would free up resources for development of 
robust reentry strategies to provide treatment and support, reduce recidivism, and 
strengthen communities and families.
Thank you for considering my opinion.
