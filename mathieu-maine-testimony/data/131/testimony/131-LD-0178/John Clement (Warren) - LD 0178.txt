John Clement
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is John Clement and I am writing in support of LD 178.
First and foremost, I would like to thank the committee for working tirelessly on this 
parole bill for the sake of the prison community.
Parole is a privilege, not something granted to me based on frivolous merits or 
personal achievements while incarcerated. I would like to lay out what I have done 
while incarcerated. I would first like to take full responsibility for the serious crime 
against my community. For 2 years, I've taken “Thinking for a Change" and "Houses 
of Healing” to deal with my impulsiveness and poor decision making. I am presently 
in college at UMA trying to obtain my degree in Health and Human Services. I'm 
looking to use that degree to become a therapist. If granted parole I intend to give 
back to the community and show that I'm serious about my rehabilitation.
My goal is to continue with my own treatment and rehabilitation to become a 
productive citizen and help build my community, and not harm those in that 
community.
I also want to build trust with my community and my own family as well. These are 
my heartfelt goals if I'm granted parole.
Thank you in advance for your time and attention in reading this testimony, as well as your 
consideration.
