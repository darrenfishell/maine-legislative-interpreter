Brian DeSimone
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Brian DeSimone, and I am writing in support of LD 178.
I am currently incarcerated at the Maine State prison, and though I am serving only a 
short sentence, it is my strong belief that the residents serving longer sentences and 
doing the right things, programs, and educational classes should have the opportunity 
to serve out the remainder of their time on parole.
Please vote in favor of this bill. Thank you for your support.
