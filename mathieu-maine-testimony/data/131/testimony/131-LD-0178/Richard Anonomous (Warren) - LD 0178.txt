I am responding to some of Ardell's questions.
Goodtime being up to 1/3.
      - Some people receive 7 days per month goodtime, which is up to 84 days 
         per year off the sentence, which is up to 23% off the sentence.
      - The majority of residents are under the 5 days a month goodtime, which 
         is up to 60 days per year off the sentence, which is up to 16% off the 
         sentence.
It was asked of Jeremy Pratt as to how many people were currently incarcerated for murder, 
and the answer is 13% of the MDOC population. This information can be found on the Maine 
Department of Corrections website:

I hope this helps.
Thank you for all of your work on this.
