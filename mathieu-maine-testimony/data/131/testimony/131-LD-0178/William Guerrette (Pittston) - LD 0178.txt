l rise to oppose LD 178. 
My name is William Guerrette from Pittston, Maine. lam a lifelong Maine 
resident and victim of a violent crime. My life and the life of my daughter 
have been irreparably damaged by a brutal home invasion and attempted 
murder by machete at the hands of Leo Hilton. 
My daughter and l both have irreparably brain damage and the childhood of 
my sweet ten year old daughter was stolen. My 33 year marriage was alsoa 
victim and my family broken up.‘ 
The miracle from God that my daughter survived after being called deceased 
at the scene would be irreparably harmed by the parole of our attempted 
murderers. She will likely be forced to move from our state by constant fear. 
The fact that my daughter's mental ability, childhood, and lifelong security 
were stolen by men that chose to kill her rather than leave a witness to my 
murder. 
Criminals have been sentenced based on a system without parole- . To bring 
back parole will again victimize my family. Please do not be part of that.l 
love Maine and its people. We are a beautiful and safe state. Please do not 
re-victimize the Maine victims of violent crime. 
We deserve better. I beg you to put victims before their perpetrators. 
Perhaps passing a victims’ rights legislation would be a better choice. 
1. Restorativejustice 
2. Rehabilitation 
3. College education and training 
Where are these benefits and programs for me and my daughter?
