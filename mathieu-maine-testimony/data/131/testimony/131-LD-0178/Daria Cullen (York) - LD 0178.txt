LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Daria Cullen. I live in York County. I’m writing to you today in favor of 
LD 178 and the effort to re-establish parole in Maine. I support this bill because I 
believe a criminal legal system without parole is a system without checks and 
balances as evidenced by the racial disparities.
Maine is one of seven states with a Black/white incarceration rate higher than 9 to 1 
yet Black people make up 1% of the state’s population. Having a Parole committee to 
review sentences and circumstances leading to conviction will help to address this 
issue and can reduce those numbers.
I also believe Parole promotes public safety in that it offers an incentive for 
incarcerated people to take an active and meaningful role in their rehabilitation. And 
Parole offers an opportunity for the victims to be heard which is not a condition of the
current release option available through the Supervised Community Confinement 
Program.
Additionally, it costs $76K per year to incarcerate one person, and more as they get 
older. It’s not sustainable and those funds would go a long way towards investing in 
people and building thriving, not fractured, communities. Lastly, bringing back Parole
recognizes a persons humanity and fosters a pathway to healing and rehabilitation that
longterm incarceration does not.
For all of these reasons I hope I can count on your support for LD 178. Thank you for 
your work and for considering my opinion. 
Sincerely,
Daria Cullen
