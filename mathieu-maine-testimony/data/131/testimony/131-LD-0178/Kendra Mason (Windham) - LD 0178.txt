Re: Testimony on behalf of LD 178
March 13th, 2023
My name Kendra Mason and I am currently incarcerated at Southern Maine Womenâ€™s 
Reentry Center in Windham Maine. I am writing in support of LD 178. I am a believer in 
reintegration and reentry and have faith that Maine will move in the right direction. 
Passing LD 178 would create safe reentry planning and support safe communities across the 
state of Maine. I have personally recognized the mistakes that led to my incarceration and 
believe that there is fulfilling programming that has helped me with my Substance Use 
Disorder. I ask that Maine have compassion for the people of their state, victims, and those 
who have committed crimes. The generational impact that incarceration can have is proven in
Maine. Passing LD 178 will help rebuild the damage that has been caused. 
Thank you for your time. 
Respectfully, Kendra Mason
