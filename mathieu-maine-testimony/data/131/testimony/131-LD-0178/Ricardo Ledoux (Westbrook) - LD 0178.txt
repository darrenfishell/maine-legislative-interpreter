Honorable Members of the Criminal Justice Committee,
I am writing to express my strong support for LD 178, An Act to Support Reentry and 
Reintegration. This bill seeks to reinstate the parole system in Maine, which was abolished in 
1976. As an ex-resident of Maine, I believe that reinstating parole is crucial for creating a more 
just and effective criminal justice system in our state.
One of the primary reasons why I believe that parole should be reinstated is because it will 
provide an opportunity for those who have been incarcerated to reintegrate into society. As it 
stands, prisoners who are released from Maine's correctional facilities are often left without any 
support or resources to help them transition back into the community. This lack of support often 
leads to recidivism, as individuals are unable to find housing, employment, or other basic needs. 
With the opportunity for parole, however, individuals can be provided with the resources and 
support they need to successfully reintegrate into society.
In addition to providing support for individuals who have been incarcerated, reinstating parole 
can also benefit our communities. With the current system, individuals who have been released 
from prison are often left without any supervision or guidance, which can make them more likely 
to engage in criminal activity. By offering parole, however, individuals can be held accountable 
for their actions and required to adhere to a set of rules and regulations. This can help to reduce 
the likelihood of recidivism and make our communities safer.
Another reason why I believe that LD 178 should be passed is because it is consistent with the 
values of justice and fairness. As a society, we believe in the principles of rehabilitation and 
second chances. By abolishing parole, we have effectively denied individuals who have been 
incarcerated the opportunity to redeem themselves and make amends for their past actions. 
Reinstating parole is a critical step towards correcting this injustice and providing individuals 
with a path to rehabilitation and reintegration.
My dear friend has been incarcerated for 18 years and has worked to change his life. He has 
earned his associates, two bachelor’s degrees, a master’s degree, and I am supporting him as he 
starts a PhD. I have watched him take responsibility for the fight that ended our friend’s life in 
2006. He has found recovery, is connected with so many beautiful people, and he has several 
opportunities when he leaves to support other people and to even teach at a University. 
In conclusion, I strongly urge you to support LD 178 and reinstate the parole system in Maine. 
Doing so will not only benefit individuals who have been incarcerated, but will also promote 
public safety and support the values of justice and fairness. Thank you for your time and 
consideration.
