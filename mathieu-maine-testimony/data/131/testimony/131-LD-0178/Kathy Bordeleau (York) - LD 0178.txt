My name is Kathy Bordeleau, I live in York ME.  
I support this bill because having parole in Maine :
- Allows individuals to be considered for re-integration into their communities if they have 
proven to have rehabilitated
- Is fiscally responsible, to have people back to work vs paying to incarcerate them. 
- Allows a Parole Board to review the cases on their merits, vs. an arbitrary sentencing 
timeline 
- Is fair for non violent offenders to allow release if they have proven to progress and not 
re-offend.
