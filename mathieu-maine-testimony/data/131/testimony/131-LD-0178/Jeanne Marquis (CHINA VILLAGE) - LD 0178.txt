Support LD178: An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the Community.
To: Senator Bebee-Center, Representative Faulkingham and the Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety. I am writing to you to urge you to SUPPORT 
LD178, An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the Community. 
I am Jeanne Marquis, resident of China, Maine. In my work with the recovery 
community and as an advocate for social justice, I have had the privilege to become 
acquainted with people who have experienced long term incarceration and have 
worked hard to turn their lives around. Frankly, the environment of jail was not the 
catalyst for their rehabilitation.They grew despite the environment. They reached 
internally to find the drive to seek improvements: take college courses, achieve 
degrees, advocate for legislation or  find a spiritual life. They rehabilitated 
themselves. 
When people overcome the behavior that had put themselves into long term 
sentences, additional time no longer serves a purpose to society. We need to reinstate 
parole in the state of Maine. It cost $78,000 to taxpayers per year to incarcerate each 
person in Maine. When an inmate has proven they have fully rehabilitated 
themselves, we need to parole them and integrate them back into society as 
productive citizens. 
I urge the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety to support LD178. 
Sincerely, 
Jeanne Marquis
