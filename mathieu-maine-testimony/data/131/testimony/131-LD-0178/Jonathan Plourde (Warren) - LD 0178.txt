Jonathan Plourde
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Jonathan Plourde and I am writing in support of LD 178.
Please take my testimony in favor of LD178 into consideration. I am a resident at the 
Maine State Prison and although parole may never affect me, it would certainly 
benefit the community here in Maine and my friends behind bars.
Thank you for your time.
