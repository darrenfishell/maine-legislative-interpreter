LD 178
I am submitting testimony in support of LD 178, to reinstate parole and encourage 
successful reentry into the community for people who have used their time 
incarcerated to better themselves and those around them. There are people in Maine's 
state prisons who could be contributors to society and no longer need to be 
incarcerated, and reestablishing parole would give them a chance to show that they 
can do so. 
Some people incarcerated in Maine have taken advantage of the opportunities offered 
to them by the very forward-thinking Commissioner, and bettered themselves through
education. They deserve a chance to show that they've truly reformed their hearts and 
their lives. 
I myself served six years in prison, in Virginia, and know there are always deserving 
people inside the system who no longer need to be there, because they've changed. 
Maine did so much earlier - but parole was abolished in many other states in the 
tough-on-crime 90's at the height of the crime epidemic, and was in many ways an 
overreaction and regressive step that doesn't benefit anyone. Longer sentences do not 
reduce crime, or help crime victims. They needlessly lock people away for decades, 
and make people incarcerated worse by taking away their hope. People inside should 
be able to earn their way home, by working, taking classes, earning degrees, and 
helping others. Incarcerated people like Steven Matthew Clark are doing all those 
things, and deserve a chance to come home after showing they're different people 
now. 
I urge you to support LD 178 and give people a chance to earn their way back into the 
community.
