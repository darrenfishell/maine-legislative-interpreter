I want to add my voice to recommend Parole return to Maine.
I have been a weekly volunteer to MSP leading Meetingbrook Conversations, an open forum 
resident-driven conversation on all and any topic since the old prison. I have also taught 
college courses in the humanities, specifically philosophy, at MSP as an adjunct lecturer for 
UMA since 1989.
I have found the men I’ve come to know over these years to be intelligent and worthy of 
consideration for release back into the community. So many that I’ve come to respect and 
value as co-students and explorers of values and character development have inspired me 
and displayed qualities that would benefit many in our everyday society were they to 
experience parole and return to an exclaustrated life. I use the word “exclaustrated” 
advisedly, in that, for a significant number of men I’ve known at MSP, they resemble residents
of a monastery whose life of prayer, study, meditation, and good works have brought them to 
a psychological and spiritual place of equanimity, reliability, and availability.
It would be wonderful to allow them to be experienced, and allow them to experience, outside 
of prison confines, the work and life of beneficial grace, service, and freedom — for and with 
— those fortunate to come to know them.
I am for parole returning to Maine, and I am for the men who deserve this chance to thrive 
and contribute in this beneficial opportunity.
