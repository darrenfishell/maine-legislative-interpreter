In Favor: LD 178 An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the Community.
To Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee,
My name is Sass Bordokin and I am writing in favor of LD 178: An Act to Support Reentry and 
Reintegration into the Community. 
What are we saying to the youth of this state if we act as if people are incapable of 
rehabilitation? What do we have to gain by keeping people imprisoned without regard to the 
status of their rehabilitation and healing? Please ask yourself these questions. Look in the mirror 
and then ask yourself again.
We deserve a better world than this. We deserve to be held when we make mistakes. We deserve 
to be invested in – not just for us but also for the greater good of the whole. What good comes of 
all this? It’s treacherous at its core to cage human beings, never mind do so without any regard to 
whether its even offering protection to those outside of the cages. If a person poses no threat due 
to internal work and we keep them separated from the world at large, what positive outcome 
does that produce?
When we look at recidivism rates, do we ever consider those who may have healed but then 
became more deeply wounded by the system as they remained caged?
It’s a calamity the way we treat ourselves, because make no mistake of it: if it’s happening to 
them, it could be happening to you.
There’s statistics aplenty for you to look at as you consider this bill. I’m asking you to just think 
about what world you want to live in. Your kids? Would you want them to be without possibility 
of parole if they made a mistake that wound them in this position? How about you? Are you 
beyond the ability for rehabilitation? Do you lack enough worth that you deserve to be caged? 
What would it take?
Please vote in favor of this bill.
Thanks,
Sass Borodkin
