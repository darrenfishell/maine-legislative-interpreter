LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Chriss Sutherland and I am a resident of Cape Elizabeth. I am a public 
school teacher and a father of three children.
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill for three reasons: 1) I firmly believe in a carceral system that 
prioritizes rehabilitation over incarceration, we need to invest in a system that works 
to return people to regular society, when appropriate, rather than lock them away, 2) a
robust and well funded system of parole would help supervise released individuals as 
they transition back to regular society, finally 3) it would be more economic for the 
state as it is nine times more expensive to incarcerate someone than supervise them on
parole. 
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
