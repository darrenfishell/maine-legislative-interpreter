Hello I am Kevin Jefferson. I'm here to testify on Savannah Smiths behalf. Firstly, I 
think savannah would be a great candidate for parole For Multiple reasons, but to 
understand my reason is to truly understand her. I believe she would be great because 
despite the situation that cost her freedom, she is still an amazingly kindhearted 
person who has always been there to help any and every one she comes across while 
asking for nothing in return. She tries to go above and beyond to ensure some else is 
well or taken care of. I truly Believe that she ended up in a situation at a young age 
and has made mistakes in life, but I also believe that she has owned and accept 
responsibility for the mistakes and will spend the rest of her life trying to make up for 
them. I think that Maine should definitely have parole especially for people like her 
and who have been in a bad situation that they can come back from. i personally 
believe that prison/ jail doesn't truly help people, but it does force them to grow at a 
certain point and I believe that it definitely forced her to grow in too the person who 
may stand or sit before you and if you got to know her the way I did I honestly 
believe you would agree. As far as parole in Maine I do believe that a lot of people 
deserve a second chance at life I don't think as far as the young one deserves to lose 
their youth if they have the possibility of freedom again. Just like a recovering addict 
or alcoholic should forever be punished because they fell in to that life.
