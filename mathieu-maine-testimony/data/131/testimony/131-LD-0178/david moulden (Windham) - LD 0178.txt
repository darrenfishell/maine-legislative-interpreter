Good morning members of the Criminal Justice Committee,
My name is David Moulden, and I am here today to express my support for LD 178, the Act to 
Support Reentry and Reintegration in Maine. As someone who has been impacted the criminal 
justice system for many years, I can see the positive impact of having a parole system in place to 
support individuals as they reintegrate into society.
Currently, Maine is one of a few states in the nation that does not offer parole. This means that 
individuals are required to serve their entire sentence behind bars, regardless of any progress 
they may have made in rehabilitation and personal growth. This is not only costly for taxpayers 
but also denies these individuals the opportunity to rejoin their families and communities as 
productive, contributing members of society.
Studies have shown that access to parole can lead to a significant reduction in recidivism rates. A 
recent report by the Urban Institute found that individuals who were granted parole had a much 
lower likelihood of returning to prison within three years compared to those who were not 
granted parole.
Furthermore, in Maine, the annual cost of incarceration is estimated to be over $51,000 per 
person. By reinstating parole, we can help reduce the burden on the prison system and save 
taxpayers' dollars. A study conducted by the Vera Institute of Justice found that states that have 
expanded their parole systems have seen significant reductions in both the number of people 
incarcerated and associated costs.
This not only places a significant burden on the prison system, but it also denies individuals the 
opportunity to rejoin their families and communities as productive, contributing members of 
society.
As a friend of Steven Matthew Clark, I have had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the 
positive changes he has made in his life while incarcerated. Steven's transformation is a 
testament to the power of rehabilitation and the potential for individuals to turn their lives around 
with the right support and resources. It is clear to me that he has demonstrated a strong 
commitment to personal growth and rehabilitation.
By granting individuals like Steven who have demonstrated a commitment to rehabilitation and 
personal growth the opportunity to reintegrate into society through parole, we can help reduce 
the burden on the prison system and save taxpayer dollars.
In conclusion, I ask this committee to support LD 178 and bring parole back to Maine. By giving 
individuals who have demonstrated a commitment to rehabilitation and personal growth the 
chance to reintegrate into society, we can help reduce recidivism, promote public safety, and 
save taxpayer dollars. Thank you for your time and attention.
Maine Resident,
David Moulden
