Derek Poulin
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Derek Poulin and I am writing in support of LD 178.
I would like to share a few words with you on paper. I've had a hard time dealing with
the sentence the State gave me 10 years ago. Life. A life sentence. 10 years has been a
long time for me, and even longer time for me to think about what had happened 
throughout it. I have done a lot of growing up. I'm not the same person as I was, and it
took about this amount of time to show it. Life has a lot of crazy experiences in it, for 
me and for everyone. I would love a chance to live my life again, and see my family. I
would love to be free.
Thank you for reading this letter. God bless.
