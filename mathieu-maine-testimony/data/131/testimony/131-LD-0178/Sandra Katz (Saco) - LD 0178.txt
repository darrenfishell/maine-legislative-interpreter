LD 178
I am writing in support of LD178 to support bringing parole back to Maine. Parole is such an 
important thing in helping folks who are incarcerated work toward being released. It offers 
people a second chance and the chance to heal. It is much better for people who return to 
society to have had a goal to work toward, rather just giving up. Parole is a crucial part of that.
Please return parole to Maine.
Thank you for your time!
