LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Phuc Tran and I am a resident of Portland. I am a teacher, writer, and 
artist.
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill because I was shocked to learn that Maine did not offer parole. The 
absence of parole negates a person’s ability for rehabilitation or reform. I think that a 
person’s potential to change is universal and deeply human, regardless of whether that
potential is met. By not offering parole, we are denying that potential for change.
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your support 
for LD 178.
