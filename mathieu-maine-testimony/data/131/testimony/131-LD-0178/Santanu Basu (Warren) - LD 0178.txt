Certainly parole is not unique to Maine. It exists in the majority of states in America. 
However it is understandable why it may be a sensitive topic for some.
A convicted murderer who commits a crime for the first time in his or her life can 
truly have remorse, shame and guilt for their crime. The loss of the victims family 
NEVER goes away so they don't want to forget but holding one's self hostage to that 
moment in time doesn't allow for healing.
Some facts about parole are it will save Maine taxpayers millions of dollars over a 
short period of time (current cost to warehouse/incarcerate is over 75k per prisoner 
per year). Taxpayers of Maine are being overburdened when public safety can be 
improved with the implementation of a structured parole reentry plan. A felons 
housing change doesn't take away the accountability that currently exists within the 
probation/parole of the DOC. They are doing it already with parolees from other 
states here in Maine.
Why not remove the burden not only from citizens and taxpayers here in Maine but also the 
burden of true healing from the victims families? 
No matter how much dollars and "sense" it logically makes to bring back parole, real human 
feelings play a role in the process. I implore you to give the restorative justice process a 
chance to prove that parole and public safety can work hand in hand like 70% of the country 
is currently doing.
Today you can choose to forgive NOT because of an apology or because of 
acknowledgment of pain you have suffered but because your soul deserves peace.
