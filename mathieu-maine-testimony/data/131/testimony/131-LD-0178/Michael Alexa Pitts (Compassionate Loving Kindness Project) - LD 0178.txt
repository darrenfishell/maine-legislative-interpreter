Criminal Justice Committee
Good morning members of the Criminal Justice Committee in Maine. My name is Michael 
Alexa Pitts and I am here to speak in support of LD 178, the Act to Support Reentry and 
Reintegration. I am speaking on behalf of my fiancé, Steven Matthew Clark, who has been 
incarcerated for 18 years.
Steven has worked hard to rehabilitate himself during his time in prison. He has earned an 
associate's degree, two bachelor's degrees, a master's degree, and is now starting a PhD program. 
He has also earned several professional certifications and has worked with over 1500 people as a 
volunteer, tutor, and mentor for those in recovery and reentry.  I have personally met some of 
these people who met me for lunch when I came to visit Steven. Each one of them shared a 
similar story of how Steven helped them when they were in prison and how they are free because 
of the hours he worked with them. 
Steven has made many connections with people who want to help him. I am one of them, I love 
Steven deeply, and I really want him home to build a life with him. We plan to start a non-profit 
organization together in the future to help incarcerated individuals and single mothers.  What is 
beautiful is Steven’s goal is to get out  and help people using his lived experience of 
incarceration. 
As the fiancé of Steven Matthew Clark, I would like to speak to the immense emotional toll that 
his incarceration has taken on both of us. It has been an incredibly difficult journey, filled with 
ups and downs, and we have had to navigate a wide range of challenges that many people may 
never have to face.
One of the most difficult aspects of this experience has been the physical distance between us. 
Steven and I have been together for two years, and during that time we have had to maintain our 
relationship through phone calls, letters, and occasional visits. This has been a significant strain 
on us both, as we have had to learn to communicate in new ways and find creative ways to 
maintain our connection.
Moreover, the constant stress of worrying about Steven's safety and well-being has taken a 
significant toll on me. As a partner, it is heartbreaking to know that he is behind bars, unable to 
fully participate in our lives together or provide for our future. It is also extremely challenging to 
see the emotional toll that his incarceration has taken on him, as he has had to adapt to the 
challenges of life behind bars and cope with the traumas of his past experiences.
This is not just a personal struggle, however. Steven's story is not unique, and the impact of mass 
incarceration on families and communities is well-documented. According to the Prison Policy 
Initiative, nearly 2.3 million people are currently incarcerated in the United States, and this has 
devastating effects on families, particularly those in low-income and marginalized communities. 
Children of incarcerated parents are more likely to experience poverty, homelessness, and mental 
health issues, while spouses and partners of incarcerated individuals often face significant 
economic and emotional burdens.
As someone who has experienced the impact of incarceration firsthand, I am acutely aware of the 
need for change. I believe that reinstating parole in Maine would be a crucial step towards 
building a more just and equitable society, one that recognizes the humanity and potential of all 
people, regardless of their past mistakes. By providing a pathway for individuals to be released 
from prison and reintegrated into their communities, we can help to rebuild families and create a 
more hopeful future for all.
Research has shown that parole and reentry programs have a positive impact on reducing 
recidivism rates. According to a report by the National Institute of Justice, participation in 
reentry programs can reduce recidivism rates by up to 25%.
In Maine, the recidivism rate is high, with 41.3% of those released from prison returning within 
three years. Reinstating parole will provide individuals like Steven with the opportunity to 
demonstrate their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. It will also allow for a greater 
focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment.
Reentry programs and services such as job training, mental health services, and housing 
assistance can help individuals successfully transition back into their communities. Without 
parole, individuals are often released without any support, making it difficult for them to find 
employment and housing, resulting in a higher likelihood of recidivism.
As a society, we need to invest in the success of those who have been incarcerated, rather than 
writing them off as a lost cause. By reinstating parole, we can provide hope and a path to a better 
future for individuals like Steven who have worked hard to rehabilitate themselves and transform 
their lives.  Steven is no longer a threat to society, I would argue he is a gift to society. 
In conclusion, I urge you to support LD 178 and reinstate parole in Maine. Thank you for your 
time and consideration.
