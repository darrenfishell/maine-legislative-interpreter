Joseph Hastings
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Joseph Hastings and I am writing in support of LD 178.
Parole would mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but for me it would mean a lot 
because I have people that I care about doing a large sentence, and I know they are 
changing for the better. For example, my recovery coach, John Okie, is currently 
serving a 60-year prison sentence but he does a lot of things to help others out. He is a
facilitator, and he runs the program Psychology of Incarceration. John is a nice, 
caring, and respectful resident. And even though he may never go home to his family,
he strives everyday to help others out as well as being the best version of himself on a
daily basis.
I could go on all day about why I feel people that are deserving to get parole should, 
but I'm going to keep it simple. You only get one life, and I believe in second chances
for those who deserve it. But to be honest, not all people do deserve it. So with that 
being said, I want good people to get out, but not everyone. There are a lot of 
residents that are remorseful, and have taken responsibility for their crimes that I feel 
deserve the chance of parole. So with that being said, for those that are doing good, 
and have proven that they are an improved person, I say that they have earned the 
privilege of a second chance at life.
I'm a Christian, so I forgive those who ask for it, and even though we are not perfect, 
if someone comes to prison, and especially if they are doing good things with their 
time, they should be given a chance to live life the right way when the time comes.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this testimony.
