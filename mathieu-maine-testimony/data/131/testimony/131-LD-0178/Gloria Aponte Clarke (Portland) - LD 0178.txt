An Act to Support Reentry and Reintegration into the Community

I am writing to submit testimony in support of LD178. I am particularly concerned about the 
racial equity implications of the prison system. It is well documented that there is a large racial
disparity in sentencing. We know that black people are 1% of Maine’s population but they 
make up 11% of our prison population! And an even higher number 12% are those with life 
and virtual life sentences. 
Parole incentivizes rehabilitation and improves re-entry. Parole also improves public safety. 
Parole also boosts the economy and saves main tasks payers money. It's nine times more 
expensive to put someone in prison than to supervise them on parole. Parole would be safe 
for our communities because parole would not be granted to anyone who represents a risk to 
the community. Proof of rehabilitation would be required. It's also a great transition back into 
the community. The parole process helps rehabilitation and offers ways to contribute to the 
community I ask that you officially recommend that parole return to Maine. We need more 
people in our workforce. There is a projected $14.7 million annual increase to Maine’s 
economy for every 100 paroled workers! 
It's time to reconsider sentencing and release policies in Maine reinstating parole would offer 
supported safe way to reverse the harms caused by eliminating parole.
Thank you for your consideration,
Gloria Aponte Clarke
