Alexander Copeland
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Alexander Victor Copeland and I am writing in support of parole bill LD 
178.
I would like to address parole and the possibility of it being granted to the residents of
Maine. I understand that parole is a privilege not something we can have right off the 
gate of being incarcerated. It takes time to prove yourself worthy of change and 
wanting to be successful and not detrimental to society. I have taken full 
responsibility for the crimes that I have done against victims and the Maine 
community that I come from.
 To better myself when incarcerated, I'm taking several self-help programs to deal 
with my substance abuse problems and my anger issues, as well as programs such as: 
1. better and healthier living, and 2. substance abuse disorder treatment.
 If given a chance to earn parole, I will continue on the path of working to rebuild and repair 
the damage that I have done to victims, family, and my community. Thank you for taking the 
time to read my testimony.
