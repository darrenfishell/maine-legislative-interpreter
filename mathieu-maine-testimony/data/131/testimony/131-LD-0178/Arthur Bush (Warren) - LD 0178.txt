Arthur Bush
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee
My name is Arthur G. Bush number 79287, and I'm writing in support of LD 178.
 I would like to thank all parties that have worked very hard on this bill, not just for 
me, but for all incarcerated Maine prisoners.
 I understand that parole is not something handed out to anyone who asks, but 
something that is given to those that work hard and deserve a chance at early release 
into society. While I have been in prison, I finished a substance abuse class, and then 
volunteered to take it again. I also took a 16 week challenge class that dealt with 
things from substance abuse to criminal thinking and positive thinking. I also 
completed several other programs to help with my personal growth and positive ways 
of life and I have been taking classes for my Hi-SET and graduated all classes except 
math. Soon I'll have that done and I'll have my Hi-SET also, plus I have finished 
several positive classes on the tablet.
 I am committed to doing good and positive things in the future. When I'm released, I plan on 
going to mental health and substance abuse classes and meetings and I aim to stay clean. I 
know doing drugs has not only hurt my life but has impacted all those around me and my 
victim. I know I hurt her and her family and I have felt guilty and sorry since the day I 
committed my crime. Drugs turned me into a monster that assaulted her and robbed her 
place of work. To me it was the worst thing I've ever done and I'll never forget the pain I 
caused her. Drugs have taken everything from me, all possessions and all my family. and 
now I plan on climbing out of the hole and staying clean. Not just for me, but for my Victim 
and my family too.
