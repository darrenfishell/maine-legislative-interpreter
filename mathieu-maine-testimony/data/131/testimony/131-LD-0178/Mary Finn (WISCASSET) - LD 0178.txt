Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety.
My name is Mary Finn and I live in Wiscasset Maine.
I am writing you is support of the passage of LD 178.  I believe in the power of justice, equity and 
compassion in human relations making no exception for those who have violated the law. 
Having worked as an Occupational Therapist for over 20 years, I believe in the curative factor of doing 
productive work and contributing to society by working and participating. Once rehabilitation and 
restoration have been done, human beings are drawn to participation in becoming a contributing 
member of society. Maine is severely lacking skilled and unskilled workers in all areas of the State’s 
economy. Let’s ease the way for folks to get back to our communities, their families’ and back to work.
I urge you to vote Ought to Pass.
Sincerely,
Mary Finn, OTR, CCM
