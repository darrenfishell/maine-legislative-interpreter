Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Johanna Franzel and I am a resident of Cape Elizabeth.
I am writing to you today to show my support for LD 178 and the effort to re-
establish parole in Maine.
From 2006-2012, I worked at the Long Creek Youth Development Center, teaching 
documentary radio to young people incarcerated there. I came to know the students 
and their stories well. 
Many of them came from legacies of trauma and poverty; they had few resources to 
support a different path forward. I often wondered how their lives might have been 
changed if they had been mentored by system-impacted folks who could model 
rehabilitation, support, and understanding accountability. 
At the adult level, this model of second chances seems to be only partially realized. 
While the Maine DOC has made educational and training programs available to 
prisoners, without parole, these aren’t paired with the promise of a new life outside; 
there’s little motivation to do the hard work of transformation. 
If our justice systems reflected real belief in second chances, how might the adult 
prison population shift? And in turn, how might this shift change the legacies of 
younger generations? Our system is deeply entrenched in punishment. I think 
there’s room to include repair. 
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
Sincerely,
Johanna Franzel
Cape Elizabeth, Maine
