Alex Madore
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Alex Madore, and I am writing in support of LD 178.
I support the parole bill not only for my own sake but for the sake of many others. 
When I committed my crimes, I had been off my meds for Schizoaffective disorder 
for 2 years and so almost literally they sentenced someone other than who I am today.
I am now a straight-A college student who studies Buddhism, works 40 hours a week,
and I talk to my family every other day. I am truly a changed man.
I also know a fellow student who was sentenced to Life many years ago and I have 
hardly met a softer spoken, kinder or calmer soul; surely he deserves a second chance.
Please consider what we can contribute; there are many of us who have changed.
