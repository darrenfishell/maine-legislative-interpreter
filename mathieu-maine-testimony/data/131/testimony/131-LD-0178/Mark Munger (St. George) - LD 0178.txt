LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee,
Greetings. My name is Mark Munger and I live in St. George, Knox County.
I am writing to you in strong support for LD 178 and the important and necessary effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I have had the chance to work over time in the criminal justice systems in Denmark 
and Norway, in the Prison and Probation Services of the Ministry of Justice. The 
work has focused on solving problems in prisons and creating effective paths for 
incarcerated citizens to resume and build useful, productive and happy lives in their 
communities, with their families.
Both countries have well-established reputations for the ways in which they treat 
residents of state and local institutions and prepare them for their next stages of life. 
They spend much less money and resources than we do in the US and in Maine, and 
their results are far, far better, with low incarceration and recidivism rates.
Well-planned and administered parole is in an important element of their systems, and
in the minds of public officials is an essential tool in the process of rehabilitation and 
re-entry.
Thank you for your work.  I hope that citizens in Maine  can count on your support 
for LD 178, as important step towards a more just society, for us all.
Sincerely, 
Mark T. Munger
