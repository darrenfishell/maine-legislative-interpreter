LD 178
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Krystal Williams and I am a resident of Cumberland County. I am also an
attorney. In my work, I seek to address and, over time, reduce, the impact of systemic 
racism in the legal profession.
I am writing to you today to show my absolute support for LD 178 and the effort to 
re-establish parole in Maine.
I support this bill because LD 178 offers a reasonable path forward for incarcerated 
individuals to reintegrate into their communities after successfully demonstrating their
desire and ability to rehabilitate the mindset and behaviors that initially led to their 
incarceration. The bill offers safeguards and provides oversight to protect the public 
interest while also allowing incarcerated individuals to earn back their right to 
contribute positively to their families and communities.
Thank you for your work and for considering my opinion. I hope I can count on your 
support for LD 178.
