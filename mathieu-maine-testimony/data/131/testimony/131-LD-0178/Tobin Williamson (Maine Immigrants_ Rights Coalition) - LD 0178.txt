Sponsor ed By : Senator Beebe -Center of  Knox  
Public Hearing: March 12 , 2023 at 1 0:00am 
 
 
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safe ty Committee : 
My name is Tobin Williamson and I live in  the city of  Lewiston, Maine  in Androscoggin County . I am 
the Advocacy Manager with the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition (MIRC), a statewide network  of 
almost 100 member organizations  all work ing to enhance the li ves of Maine’s immigrant communities.  
It has been almost fifty years since Maine has seen meanin gful reform in its paro le system. Parole 
incentivizes rehabilit ation and reduces reci divism. Proof of rehabilitation is required for parole, reducing 
the long -term effects of incarceration  for people w ho deserve a  new chance. Additionally, s tatistics show 
the minorities receive prison sentences at a highly disprop ortionate rate compared to t he general 
population. We ar e hopeful that LD 1 78 would address th is disparity in some way . Finally, LD 178 wou ld 
lower taxpayer costs that are associated wit h long -term incarceration.  
Therefore, we encourage the passage of LD 178 : An Act to Support Reentry and Reint egration into the 
Community. Thank you for your consideration.  
 
Tobin Williamson  
Lewiston, ME  
MIRC Advocacy Manager
