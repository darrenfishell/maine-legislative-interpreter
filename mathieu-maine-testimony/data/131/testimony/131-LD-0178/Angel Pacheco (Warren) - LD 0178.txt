Angel Pacheco
Warren
LD 178
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Angel Pacheco and I am writing in support of LD 178.
Parole would mean a lot to people incarcerated, but for me it would be an opportunity 
for me to show my family how I have changed. To be a father to my kids, and to show
I could be a good asset to society.
I understand parole is a privilege, not something granted to me for frivolous merits 
while incarcerated. I would like to lay out what I have done while incarcerated. I 
would first like to say I have taken full responsibility for the crime I committed 
against not only my victim, their family, friends, my family and my community. For 
five years, I have taken AA classes and signed up for college classes. I have kept a job
in the prison Industries program for 2 years.
If granted parole, I intend to give back to the community and show my victim that I'm
serious about my rehabilitation by my continued efforts in AA and NA to enlighten 
them of the damage that their crimes do to others, by being a mentor to people in 
need. I intend to help any parent whose child runs a risk of being incarcerated and 
with their permission, I will step up in a role as follows: peer support of those who 
suffer from / with substance use disorder as an accountability coach, mentor, and life 
coach to those who suffer with drug addiction.
To continue with my own treatment and rehabilitation, I myself will continue to go to 
classes for my own addictions. To become a productive citizen and help build the 
community and not harm those in the community. To build trust from my victim and 
their loved ones, the community and my own family as well. These are my goals if 
I'm granted parole.
Thank you for your time and attention in reading this testimony.
