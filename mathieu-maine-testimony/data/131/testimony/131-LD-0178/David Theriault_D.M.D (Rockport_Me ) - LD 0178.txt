My name is David Theriault. Iâ€™m a retired dentist living in Rockport Maine. 
For the past year I have been going once a week to the Maine State Prison in Cushing Maine 
as member of the Jericho Circle Project.
It is my firm belief that there should be an avenue for parole afforded prisoners who have 
shown a firm commitment to rejoin society and be productive citizens.
I also feel that it is important that the parole board be composed of individuals who have skills
and experience to make these important decisions.
Thank you for your consideration,
