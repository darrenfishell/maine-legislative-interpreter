“An
Act
to
Require
Disclosure
of
Campaign
Funding
Sources”
Before
the
V eterans
and
Legal
Af fairs
Committee
Senator
Hickman,
Representative
Supica,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
V eterans
and
Legal
Af fairs
Committee.
My
name
is
Beth
Ahearn,
Director
of
Government
Af fairs
at
Maine
Conservation
V oters,
writing
in
opposition
to
LD1590,
“An
Act
to
Require
Disclosure
of
Campaign
Funding
Sources”
on
behalf
of
more
than
13,000
members
and
supporters
of
Maine
Conservation
V oters.
Maine
Conservation
V oters
works
to
build
an
inclusive
democracy
and
to
make
conservation
and
climate
action
a
political
priority .
W e
have
a
grave
concern
about
this
legislation,
namely
the
spectacularly
burdensome
reporting
and
notification
requirements
,
and
urge
the
members
to
r econsider
their
pr evious
vote
.
It
is
our
belief
that
whether
one
is
donating
to
a
school,
a
religious
institution,
the
Girl
Scouts,
or
a
political
campaign,
one
makes
donations
to
that
entity
with
the
understanding
that
your
contribution
furthers
the
stated
goals
and
mission
of
the
recipient
or ganization.
In
our
case,
the
stated
mission
of
Maine
Conservation
V oters
is
that
“
Maine
Conservation
V oters
protects
Maine’ s
environment
and
our
democracy
by
influencing
public
policy ,
holding
politicians
accountable,
and
winning
elections.”
Requiring
an
additional
layer
of
notification
and
permissions
for
money
donated
to
a
qualifying
or ganization
to
be
used
for
political
ends
when
those
ends
are
clearly
stated
as
one
part
of
a
broader
mission
borders
on
the
absurd.
It
is
our
understanding
that
given
the
notification
requirements
that
we’ve
objected
to
above,
if
a
citizen
was
to
make
a
donation
in
the
last
21-days
before
an
election,
compliant
or ganizations
would
be
precluded
from
utilizing
that
money
for
its
intended
purpose
unless
we
were
able
to
af firmatively
validate
the
purpose
of
the
contribution.
Absent
proven
evidence
of
some
truly
enormous
benefit
that
could
be
realized,
why
would
we
demand
additional
reporting,
notification,
and
af firmative
permissions
for
donations
to
or ganizations
beyond
what
is
currently
required
under
federal
and
state
law?

This
legislation
would
overly
burden
or ganizations
like
my
own
seeking
to
ethically
and
legally
engage
in
our
democratic
elections.
Maine
Conservation
V oters
strongly
ur ges
you
to
reconsider
your
previous
vote
and
instead
vote
“ought
not
to
pass”
on
LD
1590.
Thank
you.
