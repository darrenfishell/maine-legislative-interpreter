Testimony of Dan Demeritt - March 7, 2023 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
Neither For Nor Against 
LD 637 An Act to Promote the Use of Free Annual Wellness Visits by Ensuring Proper 
Medical Billing 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Demeritt. I am the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our member plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, 
Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and United Health Care. They 
provide or administer health coverage to about 600,000 Maine people. 
Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people by promoting affordable, 
safe, and coordinated healthcare. We would like to thank Representative Madigan for speaking 
With us about her bill prior to today’s hearing and her intent to address billing errors. 
When a provider conducts an annual wellness visit a healthcare service is rendered. Health 
insurance providers do not require providers to submit claims, billing codes, or documentation 
When reimbursable services are not being provided to a consumer. In fact, we feel strongly that 
neither we nor our members should be billed for services not rendered. 
Nevertheless, billing errors can occur, resulting in inaccurate charges. Our member plans 
employee experts who Work with providers to answer questions and resolve errors. 
Thank you for the chance to speak with you today. We appreciate Rep. Madigan bringing her bill 
forward and starting this conversation. 
We welcome the chance to learn more today. MeAHP and its members are happy to sewe asa 
resource for the Committee with respect to any questions or concerns during the committee ’s 
Work on this legislation.
