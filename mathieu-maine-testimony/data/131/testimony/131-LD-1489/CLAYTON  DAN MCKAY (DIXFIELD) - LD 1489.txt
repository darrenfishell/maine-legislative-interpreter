One thing I love about "wood to heat" and "wood to steam" and "wood to electricity" 
is that it is an abundant resource in Maine. Another thing I love about biomass 
electricity, it is only recognized as a renewable resource in the New England state of 
Maine. Biomass supplies 64.52% of the Class I renewable energy certificate 
purchases of the 128,942 certificates required by a law that is an unnecessary burden 
to Maine ratepayers. MAINE IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE REC PROGRAM 
THAT RECOGNIZES BIOMASS AS RENEWABLE. WE ARE PAYING EXTRA 
FOR SOMETHING THAT ONLY WE BUY.  IS THERE NO COMMON SENSE IN
THIS GOVERNMENTAL BODY?
From The Maine PUC: "Report on Renewable Resource Portfolio Requirements 
(2023) Report of 2021 Activity"The cost to ratepayers of Maine’s Class I resource 
portfolio requirement is estimated by the cost of compliance reported by suppliers, 
primarily through their purchase of RECs. During 2021, the cost of RECs used for 
compliance ranged from $0.0014 per MWh to approximately $41.75 per MWh, with a
weighted average cost of $13.52 per MWh and a total cost of approximately 
$18.8million. Additionally, there was a total of $77,100 paid in as Alternative 
Compliance Payments (ACP), which brings the total cost of compliance to 
approximately $18.9 million. This is equivalent to about 82 cents per month for a 
typical residential customer who uses 500 kwh per month; about $81.80 per month for
a medium commercial customer that uses 50,000 kWh per month; and about $817.99 
per month for a large commercial/industrial customer that uses 500,000 kWh per 
month."
Now, compare 2020 activity to 2021 activity:  . Of the 1,042,500 RECs purchased to 
meet the 2020 portfolio requirement, approximately 99%came from facilities located 
in Maine  
   Biomass accounted for 94.82% of purchases of certificatesMasine PUC "Report on 
Renewable Resource Portfolio Requirements(2022) Report of 2020 activity   "The 
cost to ratepayers of Maine’s Class I resource portfolio requirement is estimated by 
the cost of compliance reported by suppliers, primarily through their purchase of 
RECs. During 2020, the cost of RECs used for compliance ranged from 
approximately $0.0015 per MWh to $20.50 per MWh, with a weighted average cost 
of $5.97 per MWh and a total cost of $6,969,077. This is equivalent to about 30 cents 
per month for a typical residential customer who uses 500 kwh per month; about 
$30.30 per month for a medium commercial customer that uses 50,000 kWh per 
month; and about $303.00 per month for a large commercial/industrial customer that 
uses 500,000 kWh per month
  The first indisputable truth derived from these two reports is that more demand 
means higher prices (82 cents versus 30 cents) ( 1,461,546 certificates  versus 
1,136,418 certificates) due to the introduction of Class IA Resources in 2020.(93,918 
in 2020) (413,234 in 2021)  Correlating the increase in certificates to the average 
price per certificate, 2020 = $5.97 per certificate versus 2021 = $13.52 per certificate. 
 
   The second indisputable truth is that biomass derived class I certificate purchases 
could not keep up with the increase in certificates required to comply with the new 
laws.    The market for certificates will hurt Maine ratepayers so much more than 
other New England states as biomass becomes less of a price buffer without the 
ability to keep up with the rapidly increasing compliance requirements.
    Maine must consider an exit from the Certificate Market, sooner than later. The 
prices in this market are about to skyrocket with so many competing states outbidding
each other to comply with their inflated goals which far exceed any planned projects. 
This will lead to suppliers purchasing compliance through the ACP which will trigger 
the PUC requirement to postpone the Resource Renewable Portfolio Program. 
    You have sabotaged your enacted programs by your zeal to outdo other states. The 
nonsense of Chasing Carbon Zero is about to end in spectacular fashion, 
congratulations for another unintended consequence.
  Chasing Carbon Zero is Futile.                                               Carbon is Lifeblood of 
Civilization.
