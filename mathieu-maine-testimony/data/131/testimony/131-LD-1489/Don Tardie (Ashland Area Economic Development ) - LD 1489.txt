Testimony on LD 1489 
Resolve to Capitalize on the Opportunities from Revised Renewable Fuel 
Standards by Studying the Environmental and Economic Benefits of Electric and 
Steam Generation Facilities Powered by Biomass 
 
The Honorable Senator Lawrence 
The Honorable Representative Ziegler 
And Distinguished Members of the Energy, Utilities, and Technology  
Committee  
 
My name is Don Tardie, I represent the Ashland Area Economic Development 
Corporation and wish to provide testimony in support of LD 1489. 
 
In discussions with Representative Theriault, I requested a Biomass Benefit 
study be undertaken late last year. Unbeknownst to me; this Committee 
requested and got the Study on the Economic, Environmental, and Economic 
Benefits of the Maine Biomass Industry back in 2016. I applaud the Committee 
for having the vision to request such a thorough report and endorse the 
Recommendations in it. In consultation with my peers who are up to speed on 
this file, it is my understanding that many of the Recommendations are already 
in progress and should generate positive results for Maine’s Renewable Energy 
Initiative.   
Therefore, my only request is for this Committee to monitor and perhaps get a 
thorough assessment of the Recommendations to insure desired results. That 
assessment could be requested in next year’s Legislative Session as it is rather 
early to gauge the total results now.    
 
I’m assuming you are well informed on the merits of CHP Biomass and its 
importance to the future of Maine’s Renewable Energy Portfolio, and therefore, 
I will defer to the Committee Chairs on the best way to move forward. If you 
have any questions on LD 1489 and or my submitted testimony on LD 1408 from 
last week, I would be happy to answer questions. 
 
Respectfully Submitted, 
Don Tardie
