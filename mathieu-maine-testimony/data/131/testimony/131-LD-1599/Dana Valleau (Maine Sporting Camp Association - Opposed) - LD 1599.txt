Testimony in Opposition to  
L.D. 1599  
“An Act to Create an Outfitter License for Owners and Operators of Hunting, Fishing and 
Recreation Businesses That Are Not Maine Guides” . 
 
TO 
Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW) 
 
 Date:  
 
Senator LaFountain , Representative Landry , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife  my name is Dana Valleau from Liberty, and I am Director of 
Associate Members for the Maine Sporting Camp Association (MSCA)  testifying in opposition  
to L.D. 1599. MSCA represent s commercial  sporting lodges from Rangeley Lakes Region to 
Lubec and from Belgrade to Allagash.  When organized in 1987, MSCA was called the “Maine 
Outfitters Association ”. 
 
Many  MSCA members would be subject to the cost and time burden of the licensing 
requirements of L.D. 1599 . Since lodges are often organized as partnerships, li mited liability 
corporations, and regular corporations, a concern is multiple people from the same lodge 
would face the licensing requirement. MSCA is also concerned about booking agents, both in-
state  and out -of-state might be required to license. The latt er, unless doing significant 
business in Maine, might just drop Maine lodges and guides as an offering, thus having a 
negative  statewide  economic impact.  
 
Moreover, it seems licensing is a requirement without a benefit, either to the lodges or the 
public. A few states with an outfitter license , for example, provide exclusive grants of territory 
and allow hiring and supervising guides which might not be registered in the state.   
 
Consumers might also be  harmed if they believe d licensing provides protection from poor 
service or financial crimes . In contrast, the MSCA and most guide trade associations have a 
“code of ethics” members are required to uphold. Client references, a local chamber -of-
commerce, and social media are better sources for judging whether t o hire an outfitter than 
reliance on state licensing.

need to register as a guide and may be broadly interpreted with unanticipated results. Any 
changes to the definition should come from collaboration between the De partment and the 
Maine Professional Guide’s Association.  
 
MSCA members have invested millions in rural communities. They collect sales taxes, pay 
employment taxes, workmen’s compensation premiums, income taxes, real estate taxes, 
Department of Human Servic es licensing fees, public water supply licensing fees , and liquor 
licensing fees, to name a few. Our kitchen manager s must maintain profession al certification 
through testing every five year s. Also, to operate on private and public land, lodges pay  access  
fees,  land leases, higher  premiums for commercial auto insurance, carry liability insurance, 
and pay gate fees.   
 
MSCA lodges survived the Covid -19 lockdowns by working with clients in a positive way. 
Managers are committed to providing a high leve l of customer service and delivering quality 
experience. If problems arise, they are ready to find a reasonable solution. Their deep roots in 
their communities and significant investment clearly mitigate any need for additional licensing. 
An “outfitter lic ense” is a weighty  burden MSCA members do not want.  
 
Thank you.
