Testimony of Senator Harold “Trey” Stewart
Presenting L.D. 49, An Act to Authorize the Deorganization of Drew Plantation
Before the State and Local Government Committee
January 31, 2023
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and members of the State and Local Government 
Committee: I am Senator Trey Stewart and I have the honor of representing the people of Senate 
District 2, which includes communities in Aroostook and Penobscot counties. I am before you 
today to present L.D. 49, An Act to Authorize the Deorganization of Drew Plantation. 
This legislation was submitted following the June 23, 2022 vote where Drew Plantation voted to 
approve the deorganization procedure, and to proceed with the deorganization process. To 
provide you with some background about Drew Plantation which is located in Penobscot County, 
they have had a population of well under 100 people for more than 20 years. The current 
population is made up of just 25 people, mostly older adults, making it difficult to carry out 
required municipal operations. The mill rate has fluctuated quite significantly over the years as a 
result of the number of children attending school and some properties becoming tax exempt. One 
constituent I heard from in December 2021 said that the property tax on their camp increased by 
75 percent in just one year. 
In my opinion it is well past time for Drew Plantation to deorganize and I would encourage your 
approval for them to do so. Moving forward, critical functions would be covered by the State of 
Maine and Penobscot County, both of which you will be receiving testimony from today.
