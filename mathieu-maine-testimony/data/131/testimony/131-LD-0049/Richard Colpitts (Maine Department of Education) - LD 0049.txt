Dear Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and members of the Joint Committee:  
LD 49, An Act to Authorize the  Deorganization of Drew Plantation (EMERGENCY) , provides 
for the deorganization of Drew Plantation in Penobscot County. Section 6 outlines the provisions 
of educational services, special education services, and education -related transportation, should 
Drew  Plantation move forward with deorganization.  
Education in the Unorganized Territory of Drew Township shall be provided under the direction 
of the Commissioner as described in Title 20 -A, Chapter 119, and shall meet the general 
standards for elementary an d secondary schooling and special education established pursuant to 
this Title. The provisions described below will be implemented at the time of deorganization and 
are subject to future modification in response to changes in educational conditions.  
A. Ele mentary pupils (PK -5) whose parent(s)/legal guardian(s) is a legal resident of the 
unorganized territory of Drew Township shall be provided educational services at EUT 
school facilities located in Kingman Township. Transportation services to and from the 
designated school will be provided under the direction of the Division of State Schools - 
EUT.  
B. Pupils in grades 6 -12 whose parent(s)/legal guardian(s) is a legal resident of the 
unorganized territory of Drew Township shall be provided educational service s at Mt. 
Jefferson Junior High School for students in grades 6 -8, and at Lee Academy for students 
in grades 9 -12. Transportation services to and from these schools will be provided under 
the direction of the Division of State Schools - EUT.  
C. Tuition to s chools other than those identified in section B may be provided on behalf 
of resident pupils with the prior approval of the Director of State Schools - EUT. Tuition 
shall not exceed statutory limits, and transportation shall be the responsibility of the 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s). The school must be approved by the Commissioner of 
Education for the purpose of tuition.  
D. Special education services will be provided to identified resident pupils as required by 
federal and state statutes and regulations. Spec ial education services are administered

under the direction of the Director of Special Education for the Division of State Schools 
- EUT.  
There are currently three students of school age residing in Drew Township. In 2022 -23, one 
student is enrolled at Lee  Academy and two students at Mt. Jefferson Middle School.  These 
students were enrolled in these schools prior to deorganization so it will not cause any hardship 
on the schools where students are tuitioned. We anticipate there will be one student entering  
Kingman School Prekindergarten program in the fall of 2023.  The Kingman school has the 
capacity to meet the enrollment needs of any known students from Drew Township for the 
foreseeable future.  
The Department will be available to provide additional info rmation on LD 49 and respond to any 
questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Richard Colpitts  
Director of Education in the Unorganized Territories
