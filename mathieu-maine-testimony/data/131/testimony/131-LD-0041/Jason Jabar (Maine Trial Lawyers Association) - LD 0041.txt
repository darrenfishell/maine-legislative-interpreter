RE:  LD 41 – An Act to Increase the Hourly Reimbursement Rate o f the Maine  Commission on Indigent 
Legal Services Lawyers to $150 per Hour (Emergency)  
 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Mem bers of the Committee on Judiciary,  
 
On behalf of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association, I  am writing in support of LD 41. This law will prov ide fair 
compensation for attorneys who are appointed to rep resent indigent criminal defendants who are prosecu ted for a 
crime that could result in jail time. The Constitut ion provides these criminal defendants with an abso lute right to a 
lawyer. Under our current system, lawyers willing t o accept these court appointed cases are paid $80/h our for 
their legal services. Because this compensation is inadequate, there is a huge discrepancy between the  number of 
criminal defendants needing court -appointed lawyers and the number of lawyers willing  to accept these cases. 
This has a domino effect, creating an enormous stra in on our entire justice system.  
 
Because of the current shortage of attorneys to acc ept court -appointed cases, a large backlog of criminal cases has 
clogged our courts. Because criminal defendants hav e a constitutional right to a speedy trial, those c ases are given 
priority over civil cases, such as disputes involvi ng family, contract, or personal injury matters. Th is means 
additional delay for those individuals seeking acce ss to justice. Further, because of the enormity of the current 
backlog of criminal cases, some criminal prosecutio ns could fail – not because of the merits of the case, but 
because of the state’s inability to provide a crimi nal defendant with his or her right to a speedy tri al.  
 
This problem can only be solved with a reasonable i nvestment into hiring court -appointed attorneys. Currently, a 
lawyer spending time on several court -appointed cases can barely earn enough to pay her b ills, including 
malpractice insurance, staff and administration, an d law school loans. While she earns $80/hour for he r time 
visiting her client in jail, researching legal issu es, and appearing in court, if she needs to have he r vehicle serviced 
at a local dealership, she pays $150/hour for mecha nic’s labor. 1 This is just one example of other industry service  
rates that have increased exponentially compared to  the small increases in pay to court -appointed lawyers over the 
last 20+ years.  
 
For these reasons, I hope you will support LD 339. Thank you for the opportunity to address this bill.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
 
 
Jason M. Jabar, Esq.  
President, MTLA
