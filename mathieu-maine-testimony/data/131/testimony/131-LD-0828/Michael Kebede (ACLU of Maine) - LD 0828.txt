TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ.  
 
Ought Not to Pass - LD 828 
 
An Act to Ban the Drug Tianeptine  
 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON  
CRIMINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY  
 
April 3 , 2023  
 
Senator Beebe -Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety,  greetings .  My name is Michael 
Kebede, and I am the Policy Counsel at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed 
to advancing and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. 
Constitutions. On behalf of our members, we urg e you to reject this bill.  
This bill seeks to list tianep tine as a Schedule W drug, 17-A MRS §1102(1) , trafficking  
of which is a Class B felony . 17-A MRS § § 1102(1) , 1103(1-A)(A). With a possible ten-year 
prison term , Class B felonies carry the highest level of punishment for unlawful trafficking i n 
scheduled drugs. See 17-A MRS §  1103(1-A)(A).  
At a time when governments across the country are beginning the process of unwinding 
the failed “War on Drugs,” this bill  would take Maine in the wrong direction. It is almost 
impossible to overstate the social and eco nomic harms of this war. Rather than reduce drug use, 
this century -old war by a government on its own people has exacerbated drug -related violence 
and deaths.1 It has driven the drug market underground, causing sellers to violently compete for 
territory and customers.2 It has left drug users with no guarantee of the safety or purity of drugs, 
leading to an epidemic of overdose deaths.3 Those experiencing poverty, especially poor people

 2 of color, have been much likelier than the rest of the population to be arrested and convicted for 
drug use, possession, and sale. As a consequence, people of color shoulder a vastly 
disproportionate burden of records for drug crimes. In Maine, Black people make up 1.6 percent 
of our population, but  21% of the people arrested for Class A drug trafficking and 15% of Class 
B drug trafficking.4 
Passing this bill would worsen this crisis . Mental health challenges , often driven by 
despair, are the reason people turn to tianeptine . The way to solve that problem is to through 
better  public education and to strengthen our healthcare, housing, and educational systems.  We 
often stand before this committee and object to the creation of new crimes because creating 
felonies does not stop abhorrent be havior or address its underlying root causes. This bill is no 
different. Creating a new felony will only create more problems . 
Maine sh ould only expand its criminal code when existing law is insufficient to address 
the problem at hand. That is not the case here. We urge you to vote ought not to pass .
