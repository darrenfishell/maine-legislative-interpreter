Testimony of Rep. Lori K. Gramhch -presenting 
LD 1418, An Act Concerning Single-use Disposable Water Bottles 
and Water Reﬁll Stations 
Before the Jomt Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
Senator Brenner and honorable colleagues of the Joint Standing Coimnittee on Enviromnent and 
Natural Resources, I am Rep Lori Gramhch I represent House District 113, the beautiful seaside 
cormnunity of Old Orchard Beach Thank you for the opportunity to present LD 1418, An Act 
Concerning Single-use Disposable Water Bottles and Water Refill Stations 
Single-use plastic water bottles are one of the most coimnonly used types of plastic, and they are 
also one of the most damaging They harm wildlife and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions 
They are partof the truly staggering amount of plastic that pollutes our oceans, with eight 
million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean each year,1 harming marine life and breaking 
down into microplastics that enter the food cham and ultimately affect human health 
Plastic takes hundreds of years to break down, which means that even if it 1S buried in a landﬁll, 
it will remain there for a very long time As plastic breaks down, it can release harmful 
chemicals into the environment In addition, landﬁlls can become overwhelmed with plastic 
waste, leading to enviromnental and health risks for nearby cominumties 
By phasing out single-use plastic water bottles and encouraging reusable containers, we can take 
a signiﬁcant step towards reducing plastic waste and protecting our planet We can reduce the 
amount of plastic waste that ends up in landﬁlls and oceans, lower the overall consumption of 
plastic and decrease the demand for fossil fuels used in the production of plastic bottles 
It 1S clear that single-use plastic is a problem we need to address - for our planet, our wildlife and 
our health

LD 1418 would address smgle-use plastrc water bottles by proh1b1t1ng state entrtres, burldmgs 
and functlons from servlng or selhng water 1n smgle-use plastrc bottles, requlnng rnstead that 
water ﬁlllng statlons are avallable so that state employees and members of the pubhc allke have 
the opportumty to access clean, healthy dr1nk1ng water usmg reusable conta1ners 
There are reasons that s1ngle-use water bottles are so ub1qu1tous They are convement, and they 
can help address a very real problem for people who do not have access to clean dnnklng water 
LD 1418 recogmzes these challenges and, lnstead of s1mply barmlng s1ngle-use plastlc water 
bottles, 1t helps to provlde surtable alternatlves so that we ma1nta1n and even rmprove access to 
the one thmg none of us can l1ve wlthout clean water 
Water reﬁll statrons allow 1nd1v1duals to reﬁll the1r reusable contarners w1th clean, fresh water, 
el1m1nat1ng the need to offer smgle-use water bottles 1n the ﬁrst place They are convement and 
envlronmentally fnendly They even offer economrc beneﬁts, smce free pubhc water statlons 
save people money when compared to purchasmg srngle-use water bottles, and decreaslng the 
use of srngle-use plastlcs also reduces pressure on the waste management stream 
As wntten, Sectron 4 of the b1ll also addresses water reﬁll statlons at retall establishments 
Ultrmately, I beheve our goal must be to reduce slngle-use plastlc water bottles 1n all settmgs, 
but I am mmdful of the rmportance of settlng real1st1c trmeframes and requrrements for our 
busrness estabhshments I ask the cornmlttee to conslder amendmg the b1ll so that 1t only pertalns 
to bu1ld1ngs 1n the State House complex or perhaps state bu1ld1ngs generally Th1s W111 g1ve us 
the opportumty to do the nght thmg ourselves and model the behavlor we want to see r1ght here 
1n state government, and 1t w11l g1ve us the chance to examrne a longer trmehne to work w1th the 
pnvate sector to accompllsh th1s goal more broadly I look forward to worklng wrth the 
commrttee to ﬁnalrze an amendment to th1s effect 
LD 1418 1s an lmportant step to preserve our natural resources, protect our W1ldl1fe, prevent 
unnecessary pollutlon and subsequent human health effects, and promote responslble behavlors 
Together, we can create a more sustamable future 
Thank you for your consrderatron I am happy to answer any questlons you may have forme
