May 3, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Joint Std an mg 
Committee on Environmental and Natural Resources, my name IS Newell Augur I ama 
resident of Y th armou and a lawyer with Pierce Atwood l represent the members of the Maine 
Beverage Association, your local distributors of a variety of refreshing products including diet 
soda, soda, jUlC6S, sports drinks and, increasingly, water l am here to testify in 0 tt pposi iono 
LD 1418, An Act Concerning Single-use Disposable Water Bottles and Water Refill Stations 
Increasingly, more Americans are choosing bottled water as a no-calorie convenient and 
refreshing on-the-go beverage option That is a good thing Water like man other foodd , y an 
beverage products, is packaged in PET (or number 1) plastic Unlike many other forms of 
lastic hh p w IC are not recyclable, PET is recyclable In fact, PET IS the most recycled plastic 
worldwide Plastic water bottles and the caps sold by our companies are 100% recyclable Our 
industiy is one of the few that has specifically designed nearly all of our packaging to that 
standard 
Beverage containers are among the most recycled consumer product packaging in the nation 
Our companies are working to ensure that even more of these containers end u wh th p ere ey are 
supposed to — in recycling programs and not in the trash or as litter We have committed to 
increase the amount of recycled PET content used in our bottles and as an industry are invested 
in getting “Every Bottle Back” to make good on that commitment We have invested in research 
— going on right here in Maine — on developing a bio-based material for water bottles tht a comes 
from harvested timber We have saved hundreds of millions of pounds of raw materials through 
l ht ig -weighting and packaging reductions Collectively, these changes are significantly reducing 
the environmental footprint of our packaging
It is important to keep in mind the actual scale of the plastic bottled water footprint Those 
bottles account for less than one-third of 1 percent of all waste produced in the United States 
(Paper makes up more than 40 percent of landfill content, according to the EPA) Further, the 
petroleum used to make plastic water bottles — often cited by our critics - accounts for 4/100ths 
of 1 percent of America’s total oil consumption These facts may explain why there IS no other 
state in the country that has imposed a statewide ban on the sale of bottled water 
None of this is to say that beverage companies are satisfied with the current response to the 
problem of plastic pollution Our beverage companies are partnering with The Recycling 
Partnership and the Closed Loop Foundation, organizations that are focused on reviving 
consumers ’ interest in recycling by educating them on what, how and why to recycle, and 
making direct investments in recycling and collection infrastructure to support a circular 
economy Through these organization and as an industiy, we are supporting progressive 
policies that advance these goals 
The members of our association — Blue Triton/Poland Spring, Coke Northeast, Keurig Dr 
Pepper, Pepsi Beverages Maine and Polar Beverages — had a bottle bill redemption rate of 81% 
in 2022 (that does not count the bottles that we recycled through municipal recycling programs) 
We agree that there IS more to do to make sure our plastic bottles do not wind up as litter in 
waterways or dumped in landfills Our bottles are made to be remade They can be used again 
and again for new bottles or for other products so we can reduce the amount of new plastic 
used today We want every bottle back, and we’re investing significant resources in innovations 
and recycling systems that keep plastic out of our oceans, rivers and shorelines 
We do not oppose the installation of water refill stations and, in fact, have installed them on any 
number of college campuses where we have an account relationship However, we do not 
believe that requiring every Maine retailer that sells bottled water to install a water refill station in 
the store and prohibiting the sale of bottled water in State buildings where food service is 
provided, as envisioned by this bill, is the right answer The better course is continuing to create 
and develop the types of public-private partnerships that have been forged, and that are 
advancing packaging sustainability 
An Act to Promote a Circular Economy through Increased Post-consumer Recycled Plastic 
Content in Beverage Containers, which became law last session, IS an excellent example of 
this The legislation built upon existing commitments that the parent companies of the local 
distributors in our association have made to increase the percentage of rPET in their bottles and 
packaging The Coca Cola Company has set a target of 50% recycled content in beverage 
bottles and cans by 2030 Keurig Dr Pepper aims to have 30% recycled content across its 
packaging portfolio by 2025 Pepsi Beverages Company has set a target of 25% recycled 
content in plastic packaging in the US by 2025 as well, and to reduce virgin plastic content of its 
beverage portfolio by 35% Blue Triton has a target of using 35% recycled material in all its 
beverage bottles, including Poland Spring, by 2025 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify I'd be happy to answer any questions that you may 
have
