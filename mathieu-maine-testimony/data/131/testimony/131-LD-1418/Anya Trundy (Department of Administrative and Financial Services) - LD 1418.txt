Sponsored by Rep GramlIch 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
Senator Brenner, RepresentatIve GramlIch, and members of the JoInt StandIng Comm|ttee on 
EnvIronment and Natural Resources, I am Anya Trundy, ChIef of LegIslatIve and Strateg|c 
OperatIons for the Department of AdmInIstratIve and FInancIal ServIces I am provIdIng 
testImony Ne|ther For Nor AgaInst LD 1418 as It relates to the State of MaIne as an ent|ty 
As wrItten, thIs legIslatIon proposes that bottles contaInIng less than 1 lIter of uncarbonated, 
unflavored water may not be purchased, sold or provIded to a consumer by a food seniIce or 
functIon of the State and may not be purchased by a state agency It also requIres that all 
state-owned facIlItIes and functIons have reasonable access to water reﬁll statIons 
There should be mInImal Impact to State-owned buIldIngs on the East and West Augusta 
campuses, and In Hallowell and Vassalboro as all have water fountaIns avaIlable In publIc 
areas, satIsfyIng thIs bIll However, the state leases approxImately 1 9 mIllIon square feet of 
space across 250 buIldIngs for State offIces and servIces, much of whIch Is lIkely not already 
complIant wIth the proposed law The ﬁscal Impact of expandIng that complIance across the 
entIrety of the State's leased space IS estImated at a mInImum of $100,000-200,000 
DAFS would also lIke to flag for the Comm|ttee that Procurement Sennces Is aware of a couple 
of specIfIc IncIdences In whIch certaIn Departments purchase bottled water The purchase of 
bottled water wIthIn State facIlItIes for agency personnel Is not allowed unless an exceptIon has 
been granted by the Bureau of General Ser\iIces In response to water qualIty concerns ata 
facIlIty One promInent example of where thIs Is the case Is the MountaIn VIew CorrectIonal 
FacIlIty In Charleston where the Department of CorrectIons Is provIdIng bottled water In 
response to water qualIty concerns at that facIlIty Also, MEMA stockpIles bottled water 
for dIstrIbutIon In emergencIes We raIse these examples to suggest that the Comm|ttee may 
want to consIder reasonable exceptIons If you move fonivard wIth thIs bIll 
Thank you for thIs opportunIty to testIfy, I would be happy to answer any questlons
