TESTIMONY SUBMITTED T0 THE 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES 
May 3, 2023
I 
In opposition to LD 1418, An Act Concerning Single-use Disposable Water Bottles and Water Reﬁll Stations 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and honorable members of the Environment and Natural Resources 
Committee, 
Thank you for your ser\/ice to the people of Maine My name is Liz Donohue, and I am the Director of 
Government Relations at BlueTriton Brands, owner of Maine's iconic Poland Spring® brand We take 
tremendous pride in the Poland Spring® brand, the hard work of our 900 Maine employees at our Hollis, 
Kingfield and Poland facilities, and in our springs We sustainably source our water and conserve more than 
6000 acres of land surrounding our 10 spring sites In 2022 we donated 1 million bottles of water and $1 million 
to community and educational organizations in Maine 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in opposition to LD 1418 We applaud your leadership on packaging 
sustainability and your prioritization of recycling policy Specifically, we thank you for the passage last year of 
Rep Doudera's legislation to require the inclusion of post-consumer recycled content in our products which 
helps foster an improved market for recycled materials In fact, we support other states following in Maine's 
footsteps to adopt the same or similar legislation 
BlueTriton Brands IS an industry leader in packaging sustainability The Poland Spring Brand® has led the industry 
in source reduction initiatives, recyclability design, consumer education, and material innovations including the 
use of recycled content over its long history We are committed to reducing our waste footprint, keeping plastic 
out of landfills, and off beaches and hiking trails In 2022, approximately 24% of our total portfolio was made 
from recycled plastic This winter BlueTriton rolled out 100% recycled plastic 700mL and 1L bottles — not an easy 
feat given the high demand for recycled plastic into downcycled items 
We want to foster a strong circular economy where bottles are recycled directly into bottles and strive to raise 
the recycled content in our portfolio To that end we have a commitment that 100% of our products will be in 
packaging that is either reusable or made from an average of 35% recycled materials by 2025 
LD 1418 is not about recycled plastic or recycling Instead, it proposes to use policy as a tool to change behavior 
both for the manufacturer and for the consumer through an effective prohibition on the convenient sale of 
single use plastic water bottles in retail locations We appreciate the underlying intent of the proposal is to 
reduce plastic in our environment — that is our goal as well 
Let me assure you that we are exploring bioplastics and compostable options and engaging with our supply 
chain There remain a lot of questions and plenty of testing of materials and process adaptation that will take 
time and capital Nonetheless, bioplastics is being pursued

UntIl bloplastlcs or compostable materlals can be effIcIently used In the manufacturIng process, PET water 
bottles offer the lowest envIronmental footprInt of any packaged beverage wIth the lowest fossIl fuel use, 
lowest emIssIons and lowest water use to be produced Non-carbonated water can be safely packaged In super 
lIghtweIght bottles that use sIgnIfIcantly less plast|c than Is requlred by carbonated beverages Poland SprIng has 
reduced the amount of plast|c In our half-lIter bottles by over 60%, savIng approxImately 65 mIllIon pounds of 
plastIc annually 
In addItI0n, PET water bottles are the most recycled beverage contaIner Bottled water contaIners make up 
nearly 55 percent of the PET plast|c collected In curbsIde systems In comparIson, soft drInk PET bottles make up 
only 15 percent AccordIng to the Consumer RecyclIng |nstItute, the Beverage MarketIng CorporatIon and the 
NatIonal AssocIatIon for PET ContaIners Resources, of the bottles that end up In landfIlls only 3 3% are PET 
bottled water compared to 13 3% PET soda bottles 
A prohIbItIon on the sale of plast|c water bottles wIll not reduce overall waste especIally In MaIne, whIch has 
such a successful bottle return system On the other hand, thIs proposal wIll be detrImental to the health and 
well-beIng of communItIes ThIs gets to the proposal ’s unIntended negatIve Impact on consumers 
Water Is IncreasIng|y the drInk of choIce — partIcularly on-the-go I thInk we can all agree that thIs Is good news 
from a health perspectlve ChoosIng water as a prImary beverage means mIllI0ns of avoIded calorIes from sugary 
drInks and a reductIon In the assoclated health rIsks At a tIme when 70% of beverages are consumed away from 
home, elImInatIng access to bottled water means lImItIng people's abIlIty to make healthy choIces on-the-go 
Research shows that bottled water bans lead to Increased consumptIon of sugar-sweetened beverages A study 
by the AmerIcan Journal of PublIc Health (2015) conﬁrmed that bans or restrIctIons on the sale of bottled water 
can lead to Increased consumptlon of less healthy beverages The study cItes a specIfIc example In Vermont, 
where a sImIlar ban resulted In a 33% Increase In the consumptIon of sugary drInks In a case study of Sudbury, 
MA’s ban on the bottled water sales, consumptIon of sport drInks, soft drInks and ready to drmk Ice teas 
Increased whIle at other New England retaIl and convenIence store locatlons sugar-sweetened beverage sales 
dechned 
A lot of work has been done In recent years to foster behavIor change In consumers to make healthy cholces 
TakIng away a convenIent healthy choIce undoes that effort The consumer choIce Is not to buy a $30 reﬁllable 
water bottle because you accIdently left yours at home whIle tryIng to get your toddler out of the house, It IS to 
buy comparably affordable convenIent beverage to bottled water 
WhIle well-Intentloned, thIs proposal wIll not Improve our current health challenges, nor put a dent In reducIng 
landfIll waste It wIll however dIstract from the sound recyclIng p0lIcIes prevIously champIoned by thIs 
c0mmIttee and prevent Investment In envIronmentally-healthIer alternatlves 
We are eager to work wIth the CommIttee to braInstorm polIcIes that could foster a practIcal transItIon as 
materIal InnovatIons come to the forefront 
Thank you
