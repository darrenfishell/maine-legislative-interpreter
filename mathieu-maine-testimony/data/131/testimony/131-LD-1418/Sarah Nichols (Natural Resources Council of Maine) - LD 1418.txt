Testimony in Support of LD 1418, 
An Act Concerning Single-use Disposable Water Bottles and Water Reﬁll Stations 
Sarah Nzchols, NRCM Sustamable Mazne Dzrector, May 3, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representatrve Graml1ch, and members of the Jolnt Standmg Commlttee on 
Envlromnent and Natural Resources, my name 1s Sarah N1Ch0lS, and I am the Sustalnable Mame 
D1rector for the Natural Resources Councrl of Mame (NRCM) I am here to offer our support for 
LD 1418 
For nearly 10 years my _]0b at NRCM has been to advocate for practrcal, meanmgful pol1c1es that 
support Ma1ne’s sohd Waste management hlerarchy and protect people from the harmful and 
costly waste 1SS11CS created by proﬁt-dnven corporatrons Promotmg the use of free water reﬁll 
stat1ons as an alternatrve to smgle-use bottled water 1s a remarkably clear and slmple Way to 
ellmlnate unnecessary waste and support a more sustamable culture and envlromnent We 
support the thoughtful approach 1n LD 1418 to have the State lead by example by only offenng 
free drrnkmg water to guests of State bulldrngs and events and eventually requlnng water 
reﬁllmg statlons where smgle-use Water bottles are sold throughout the state 
Bottled water d1dn’t ga1n Wldespread popularlty untll the 1970s when the ﬁrst s1ngle—use plastlc 
bottles became avallable and reduced the cost and shlppmg of drmklng water to consumers, but 
1t wasn’t unt1l the late 1990s that sales really surged B1g soda companles were losmg money as 
people opted for healthler beverages, l1ke water To cap1tal1ze on that/ movement, soda 
compames launched sales campalgns agalnst tap Water, and seduced consumers 1nto buymg the1r 
bottled water as a healthy altemat1ve The sales and market1ngtact1cs of these corporatlons were 
very effectlve at manufacturmg demand for thelr product, and now bottled water 1s a soclal ndnn 
and 1s the most popular packaged beverage 1n the US1 
There 1s nothmg mherently wrong w1th offenng healthler beverages to consumers The problem 
1s the rmmense amount of pollut1on and waste created by the manufacture, shrpment, and 
dlsposal of the more than 70 b11l1on plastlc Water bottles that are purchased each year 1n the US2 
In emergencles or 1nstances where there 1s no or l1m1ted access to clean dnnkmg water, bottled 
Water makes a lot of sense But smce most tap water 1s Just as safe or safer than bottled Water,3

thmg for our health and our envlromnent and 1s why we support LD 1418 
I’ve also been workmg w1th Representatrve All1son Hepler on a b1ll to modermze our Bottle B111 
program Over the past s1x months We’ve v1s1ted many redempt1on centers, and I’ve been 
conslstently blown away by the volume of s1ngle-use water bottles Sorted mto dozens of 
dlfferent c0nta1ners no less s1nce there are so many dlfferent brand labels On these v1s1ts I’ve 
also been remmded about how grateful I am to our redempt1on centers for collecting all of these 
contamers for recyclmg and keeplng them out of env1romnent and out of our taxpayer-funded 
mun1c1pal waste stream 
Ma1ne’s lawmakers have done a great Job 1n gettmg these contamers collected for recyclmg, but 
the next steps up on the hlerarchy are reuse and reduce—tlns b1ll prov1des the perfect launchrng 
pad for that effort And, 1f the Commlttee would 11ke to ﬁnd some fundmg for water reﬁll 
stat1ons, one place to look could be the estlmated $16 7 m1ll1on 1n unclalmed deposrts from the 
Bottle B111 program that you all W111 be d1scuss1ng soon 
Thank you very much for your consrderatron of these comments I look forward to support1ng the 
Commlttee 1n 1ts work to advance LD 1418
