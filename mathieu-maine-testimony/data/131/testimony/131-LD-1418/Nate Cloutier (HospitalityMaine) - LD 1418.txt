Testimony of Nate Cloutier 
‘ Before the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources’ 
May 3, 2023 
In Opposition to LD 1418, “An Act Concerning Smgle-use Disposable Water Bottles and Water Reﬁll Stations ” 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and distinguished members of the Committee on Environment and Natural 
Resources My name is Nate Cloutier, and I am here today on behalf of HospitalityMaine representing more than 1,200 
restaurant and lodging operators of all sizes across the state HospitalityMaine opposes LD1418, “A/7Act Concern/ng 5/ng/e- 
use D/sposab/e Water Bottles and Water /?eﬂ'// Stat/ans” 
LD 1418 proposes to make changes to law concerning single-use disposable water bottles It would
l 
1 Prohibit “food sen/ice” and “state” institutions from selling or offering drinking water in single-use beverage containers 
containing one or liter or less ofwater beginning January 1, 2024 
2 Require retail establishments that offer water from a water reﬁll station to post signs within the store describing the 
location of the station and that they may use it free of charge 
3 Require retail establishments to install and maintain a water reﬁll station for use free of charge to consumers by January 
1, 2027 
4 Instruct the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to engage in education and outreach activities with retail 
establishments regarding the water reﬁll station requirements and requires them to investigate complaints received 
regarding noncompliance 
We appreciate the intent behind what this legislation aims to achieve, however the changes proposed in this bill would be 
costly and would hurt businesses, including our restaurant and lodging establishments, across the state As a state, we 
already have a strong, tested hlStO|'y of recycling with our successful bottle redemption program Bottled water companies 
and many businesses are already taking initiative to be stewards in responsible production, consumption, and recycling 
Some bottled water companies are even in the process of or have plans to tl'Ell'lSltl0l ’1| more recycled material into their 
packaging lt’s not appropriate or suitable in all instances, but some businesses have included water reﬁll stations at their 
establishments because they feel offering that ﬁts with their consumers ’ desires However, this is not the case with all 
businesses, and we don’t believe it is the role of the government to be involved to this degree that takes the choice away 
from each business owner We see there are other potential issues with this legislation 
X 0 The cost after installation for each ofthese machines could be north of $5,000, which is unfeasible for many of our 
members operating on a 2% proﬁt margin 
0 Not everyone has access to reliable and clean drinking water What are businesses to do during emergencies like 
weiust experienced earlier this week? Making bottled water available during circumstances such as these is crucial 
Moreover, as drafted, my understanding is the bill would make it illegal for establishments to even give bottled water 
away for free, which has happened during states of emergency 
0 ls the only enforcement mechanism for DEP to respond to complaints from the public? To me, the deﬁnition of “water 
reﬁll station" proposed in the bill could include a water pitcher 
0 Personal choice for owners and the consumer should be preserved It would be concerning to see the government 
intimately involved with product choices on this topic 
0 Would a food truck need to conﬁgure a mobile water reﬁll station? Where would food trucks post the signage that 
would be required by law?
