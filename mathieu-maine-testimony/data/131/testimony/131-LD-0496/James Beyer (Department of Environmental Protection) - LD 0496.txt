started construction after that date, the Department has no way to identify those 
projects that would be subject to this legislation. In addition, some projects that were 
constructed prior to October 2021, specifically those subject to the Site Location of 
Development Act, were required to submit decommissioning plans and a financial 
assurance mechanism as a condition of approval. 
With respect to decommissioning plans for stored energy systems, the Department 
needs additional specificity as to the types of stored energy systems under 
consideration to evaluate how we would implement this provision. In general, we see 
some benefit to the concept, because battery storage systems have a limited lifespan 
like solar and wind projects; they must be either reenergized or disposed of after their 
useful life. ln addition, if a battery storage system is co-located with a solar or wind 
project that has a decommissioning plan, it would be straightforward to wrap the storage 
project into that decommissioning plan. 
However, we also note that the primary reason for requiring decommissioning plans for 
solar and wind projects is that they use large amounts of land and can have substantial 
visual impacts. The decommissioning plan ensures that non-operational projects will no 
longer have these impacts. Commercial-scale battery storage systems can also have 
land use and visual impacts, but their footprint is generally less than solar or wind 
projects. 
The Department has discussed this bill with the Governor ’s Energy Office and both the 
Governor ’s Energy Office and the Department are willing to work with the sponsor to 
develop amendment language for the work session to clarify these issues. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and l am happy to answer any questions now 
and at the work session.
