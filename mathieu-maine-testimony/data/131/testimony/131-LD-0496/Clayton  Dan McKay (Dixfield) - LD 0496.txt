Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee
My suggestion for decommissioning plans for solar energy developments is to 
immediately discontinue this NEB program and apply a tax, effective immediately, 
based on the output from all currently operating projects. 
The ratepayer money having been stolen and spent on solar developments must be 
recoverable to the ratepayers. 
Remember, elections have consequences
