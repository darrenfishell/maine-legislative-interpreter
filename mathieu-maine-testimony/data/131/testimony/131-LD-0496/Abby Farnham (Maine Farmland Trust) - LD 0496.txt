Good a fternoon Sena tor La wrence, R epresen tative Zeigler , and member s of the Join t StandingCommit tee on Ener gy, Utilities, and T echnology . My name is Abb y Farnham and I am t estifyingtoday on behalf of Maine F armland T rust (MFT) t o provide c ommen ts on LD 496,An Act t oAddress Solar E nergy De velopmen t Dec ommissioning.
MFT is a member -powered statewide or ganization tha t works to protect f armland, supportfarmer s, and adv ance the futur e of f arming. Since our f ounding in 1999, MFT has helped t opermanen tly pr otect mor e than 330 f arms and k eep nearly 60,000 acr es of f armland in f arming.In 2022 alone, MFT support ed 48 f arm businesses with w orkshop s, technic al assis tance, andgrants – deliv ering o ver 680 hour s of t echnic al assis tance and $309,000 in business and seedgrants to help businesses gr ow their pr ofitability .Our main pr ogram ar eas ar e FarmlandProtection, F armland Access, St ewardship, F arm Business Planning , PFAS Support, Clima teResilience, and P olicy and R esear ch.
Protecting f armland in Maine is a principal part of our mission bec ause w e belie ve it is essen tialfor ensuring tha t we ha ve the land base t o grow our agricultur al ec onom y, particularly as mor efarmer s reach r etiremen t age and de velopmen t pressur es incr ease acr oss the s tate. Pr otectingland is also a k ey natural clima te solution b y avoiding the gr eater emissions associa ted withdeveloped land, b y providing the land base t o grow our loc al and r egional f ood ec onom y andcreate greater food security f or our s tate, and b y preser ving the clima te bene fits tha t can resultfrom f armer s using clima te smart pr actices on the land.
MFT supports r enewable ener gy pr oduction on f arms as long as it does not signific antlydiminish the pot ential f or agricultur al pr oduction. On-sit e ener gy pr oduction c an pr ovideeconomic support t o a f arm, r educe the f arm’ s ener gy costs, and is import ant for addr essingclima te chang e. But making sur e we ha ve the land base t o support a r obus t loc al and r egionalfood s ystem – and f ood security in Maine – is also critic al. As r enewable ener gy de velopmen thas incr eased in the s tate, so t oo has our under standing of the impacts tha t these pr ojects c anhave on the amoun t of f armland t aken out of agricultur al pr oduction, the loss of import antagricultur al soils, and the c ompe tition f or land tha t farmer s need t o lease in or der t o supporttheir oper ations.
MFT belie ves tha t solar g ener ation and agricultur e can co-exist symbiotic ally in Maine as long assolar siting is s tructur ed to balance these import ant interests. W e are supporting se veral policyproposals this legisla tive session tha t are aimed a t incen tivizing the siting of solar ener gyprojects tha t avoid or minimiz e agricultur al and na tural resour ces impacts, es tablishing a pilot

project t o study and cr eate unif orm s tandar ds for solar de velopmen t tha t is c ompa tible withagricultur e in Maine so tha t dual-use pr ojects c an be e xpanded thr oughout the s tate, andcreating a s tatewide public da tabase of fully permit ted or c onstruct ed ener gy pr ojects so tha tland use tr ends c an be iden tified and s trategies c an be cr eated to avoid the o ver-developmen tof import ant resour ces. While these e fforts ar e forward-looking t o promot e balanced solardevelopmen t in Maine, MFT also r ecogniz es the need t o ensur e dec ommissioning plans andstandar ds ar e in place f or solar ener gy pr ojects tha t have alr eady been permit ted or c onstruct edon agricultur al lands in or der t o preser ve the ability f or the land t o be f armed in the futur e.
The St ate’s Solar Dec ommissioning La w tha t was enact ed in 2021 r equir es de veloper s of solarener gy pr ojects tha t occup y thr ee or mor e acr es to ha ve an appr oved dec ommissioning planand acc ompan ying financial assur ance suf ficien t to cover the c ost of dec ommissioning asoutlined in the plan. The la w applies t o projects on which c onstruction s tartson or aft erOctober 1, 2021, as w ell as t o projects tha t under go a tr ansfer of o wner ship a fter Oct ober 1,2021. F or solar de velopmen t projects tha t are loc ated on land tha t has been classified asfarmland, this la w requir es a dec ommissioning plan tha t provides f or the r estoration of tha tfarmland suf ficien t to support agricultur al activities.
LD 496, while s till in c oncep t draft, pr oposes t o addr ess the issue of dec ommissioning plans f orsolar ener gy de velopmen ts tha t would other wise be subject t o the Solar Dec ommissioning La w,but f or which c onstruction beg anbeforeOctober 1,2021. It is import ant for solar ener gyprojects tha t were construct ed on f armland be fore the 2021 dec ommissioning la w was enact edto ha ve a dec ommissioning plan and associa ted financial assur ance in place tha t will pr eser vethe ability f or the land t o be f armed in the futur e. Maine’ s farmland is the f ounda tion of ourstate’s agricultur al ec onom y, and agricultur e as a sect or isa key componen t of Maine’ s econom yoverall, c ontributing o ver$3.6 billion in ec onomicimpact and supporting o ver 27,000 job sstatewide.1Farmland w as also thr eatened be fore solardevelopmen t intensified in the s tate.
