Greg C. Robie95 Mineral Springs RdHighland Mills, NY  10930March 28, 2023Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology2 State House Station Augusta, Maine 04333 MAINE STATE LEGISLATUREJoint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities, and TechnologyTECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO CONSIDERRe: LD 496Sen. Lawrence, Rep. Ziegler and Honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology,LD 496 SHOULD NOT PASSThe reasons for this are as follows:(1) The amendment to make rulemaking optional is contrary to our Maine Administrative Proceedure Act, 5 MRS Chapter 375., Subchapters 2, and 2-A.(2) The Board of Environmental Protection is charged with rulemaking for the DEP under 38 MRS §341-D(1-C), and this under its own Rules” statue 38 MRS §341-B. Restored with the authority to do so since 2019 (PL 2019, c. 315, §3), it has to date failed to follow the law.(3) Furthermore, in spite of its restored authority our BEP has allowed our DEP to effect 2 similarly named – and of the same date (10/30/2021) – forms-as-rules for DEP permitted solar decommissioning: “SOLAR DECOMMISSIONING – MINOR REVISION APPLICATION”; SOLAR DECOMMISSION APPLICATION FORM” (5 MRS §8002(9)). The latter may be used by projects permitted before October 21, 2021 to be treated the same as those enjoying the processing afforded under the 35-A MRS §§4391 - 4329) and an overreach of the 
legislative intent of our Solar Energy Development Decommissioning, An Act To Ensure Decommissioning of Solar Energy Developments, 2021 Public Law  2021, C. 151., Section 2., which affords DEP permitted abandonment under the auspices of decommissioning.(4) Proposed §3497 introduces language to provide cover for the barn door that is already wide open and will allow solar businesses with models exploiting stacks of LLC to exploit the exemption loophole in the law and come, with time, to monopolize the industry in Maine.(5) The Exempt member transfer language of § 3491(4) , and in LD 496 §3498(5) of mirrors language in the DEP Administrative Rule Chapter 2., 1., R., and only applies to “a person” as deﬁned in DEP Administrative Rule Chapter 2., 1., P.; 5 MRS §8002(8); 5 MRS §194-B(5). It is being applied applications from stacks of LLCs.(6) Please note that in LD 496, §3499(3)(C) a single “person”/LLC, and this of a stack of applying LLCs, is being held responsible for ﬁnancial assurance, and this after commercial operations date (COD). By COD, and due to the stack of LLCs, contracts and memoranda law, the “solar rights as may exist in law” will have, via claimed and exempted member interest transfers be transferred be owned elsewhere in existing and unnamed ﬁnical entities that will own AND operate a solar project for its useful life. This business model is by it’s nature one that thereby renders the identiﬁed and permitted LLC to be an LLC without the right to (a.) the sunshine that makes the solar equipment appurtenants of leased land of a project valuable; (b.) due to stipulations of the leases, the permittee will be with no rights to the solar equipment appurtenant to the leased land; (c.) rendered a project’s permittee without independent and meaningful ownership of a permitted project. (7) The effecting of two classes of leases and appurtenants regrading “solar rights that may exist in law”, and solar equipment appurtenants, is contrary to 33 MRS §1401 due to a nefarious misapplication of contract and memoranda law effecting two classes of leases regarding appurtenants that are not commonly “subject to court decreed abandonment and other limitations provided by law.”(8) LD 496 fails to accomplish what is averred in the SUMMARY.
Thank for considering this testimony. I am available and happy to answer any questions that may arise for from considering this at the above address, robie@hvc.rr.com, and/or (845) 534-7291.=)Greg Robie
