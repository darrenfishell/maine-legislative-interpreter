Executive Summary  
The Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions at the University of Maine has 
organized an interdisciplinary team of researchers with a wide array of expertise related to solid 
wast e. Together we  seek to engage with stakeholders throughout the state to identify and alleviate 
information gaps, provide opportunities for dialogue  and to participate in the process of  designing 
and building support for  sustainable solid waste ( materials management ) solutions  in Maine .   This  
paper draws upon  the team’s  collective expertise in order to: 1)  provide a brief overview of the 
history  of solid waste in Maine; 2) outline contemporary challenges; and 3) to identify  opportunities  
for the future . While many readers will likely have more complete knowledge of solid waste 
management  in Maine, our hope is that this document can serve as a starting point, a place where  
stakeholders  – citizens, municipal managers, legislators, regulators, landfill  operat ors, waste -to-
energy  operators, haulers, recyclers, composters, and other vital partners  – can provide feedback , 
help to clarify and assist in reviewing the current state of our system .  Our goal is to utilize  collective 
input to identify areas of strength and to creat e proposals  to achieve  more success in a sustainable 
materials management system . 
We invite readers to review and comment on the full repor t.  A summary of highlights include:  
 Wast e generation, management and disposal is an extremely complex issue, in part because it is 
intricately linked to a wide variety of economic, social and enviro nmental issues affecting our 
state including public service provision, municipal and state budgets, private industry , ecological 
and human health, land use, a nd resident satisfaction with service, facility siting and operations.  
 
 Ther e have been vast impro vements in  waste management services and programs since World 
War II, but  as a result  solid waste issues  have been removed  from public consciousness and 
suffered  a lack of public investment in and engagement with waste issues - except in times of 
crisis.  
 
 The history of waste management in Maine can be characterized as a series of  period ic crises.   
While we have made  some  significant advancement , the need to r espond quickly  has often pre -
empted or precluded long term planning for more efficient and sustainable waste management 
systems.   
 
 Well -designed m aterials management programs (solid waste processing and disposal, recycling, 
organics, source reduction, reuse, etc.), citizen conscientiousness, c apital investments, and 
innovative institutions can all contribute to the achievement of the waste hierarchy  and reducing 
the amount of waste generated and disposed of .  
 
 Every day, over 5000 tons of municipal solid waste are generated, collected, and mana ged (reuse, 
recycled, composted, disposed) in Maine; involving a network of varying public and pr ivate 
operations and services.  
 
ii 
 
 Today we find ourselves  closer to  another “crisis” as we need to expand existing and find new 
homes for our waste . Meanwhile pressure is mounting to  send  in more  waste  from other states 
that are imposing  landfill bans  that limit their options . 
 
 The future of Waste -to-Energy in Maine is unclear  with one facility  closed (MERC) and one with an 
uncertain future  (PERC) . WTE facilities reduce waste volume, produce electricity, and are  
supported by the State’s waste hierarchy .  
 
 All management strategies have  trades offs – processes have different costs, environmental 
impact s, and lifetimes. How the state and public should evaluate these  trade -offs is not clear .  
 
 Landfill space is a precious resource due to limited acceptable sites and public resistance to 
landfills.  Increased public engagement in waste issues, due to current debates about landfill 
capacity and continued reliance upon WTE  facilities, presents a significant opportunity to 
proactively design and invest in more sustainable materials management system in our state.  
 
 All communities are different and the re are reasons to have some  variability across the state. 
However, modern w aste management technologies (recycling facilities, landfills, waste -to-energy 
plants ) favor large facilities. To achieve reasonable per ton costs, more regionals solutions  are 
likely favorable . Further, i nclusive and integrated planning could  reduce costs, ensure more 
equitable investment and improve the state economy.  
 
 Maine can look within the state as well as to other state s for programs, policies, and information 
that successfully diverted waste and captured valuable materials . 
 
 Maine has taken a leadership role in waste management issues in the past and can draw upon our 
deep culture of “waste not” ingenuity once again to design an exe mplary and sustainable system.  
 
 Finding areas to improve on current solid waste management pract ices will require engaging the 
many groups of stakeholders and looking inside and outside the state for solutions .

I. Introduction: An Oppo rtunity to Rethink “Waste”  
Waste is a curious thing. We all generate it - paper, tissues , product packaging, demolition debris  and carrot 
tops .  Indeed, in today’s consumer society many of our most basic necessities  are wrapped , boxed or bagged .  As 
our population has grown, so has the volume of waste produced.  To accommodate this growth o ur di sposal 
approach has changed from 'dilute and disperse'  to 'concentrate and contain.' This system has clear sanitary and 
aesthetic advantages  but it also has  the negative effect of removing the compounding costs of waste  and t he 
complicated issues associate d with its management from the  public eye and consciousness.  
We acknowledge  that while citizens do not want landfills  near their homes , as a general rule people are happy 
to go on living their daily routines and don’t often prioritize public investment in waste management. Yet a 
growing number of citizens, waste managers and policy makers recognize that our  contemporary system s allow 
valuable resources to be wasted and thus are not optimal ly efficient. In today’s system , natural resour ces are 
harvested, cut, mined,  manufactured , distributed, sold, consumed and wasted. Even goods with significant value 
come to the end of a one -way, linear  system of prod uction, consumption and waste . This problem is particularly 
pronounced in the US where approximately 5% of the g lobal population consumes 25% of the world’s resources  
(Figure 1) and sends many of those resources  to landfills.
 
Figure  1: Materials Consumption in the US by Sector of Origin, 1975 -2000  Source: WRI Materials Flows Database 2005  
Our municipal governments  are legally responsible for managing solid waste  (M.R.S.  Title 38 Chapter 13  §1305 ), 
but it is an expensive burden . Waste experts  estimate that  waste management expenditures in  Maine  typically 
rank between the third and fifth highest category on municipal budgets.  Programs designed to reduce waste and 
capture a higher percentage of valuable resources before sending them to disposal  could significantly 
supplement municipal budgets  if alternatives can be utilized at lower costs than disposal . At the same time tight 
municipal budgets  may translate into a strong local prefer ence to allocate as little money as is possible to waste 
management. This cost aversion certainly makes sense and recent municipal surveys suggest that the 
overwhelming majority of municipalities are satisfied with their current waste management system and prefer 
not to al locate additional funding.  But periodically crises arise that threaten the status quo  (e.g. leaking or full 
landfills, expiring  electrical sale rate agreements to waste -energy facilities ; public resista nce toward landfill 
expansion).  Deferring decisions and investment may  make economic sense in the short term, but less sense  in 
the long term considering the implication s of our current system for long -term environmental and publi c health, 
the inefficiency of wasting  valuable resources and the costs that compound when long -term  planning  is 
neglected . 
History repeats itself when it comes to the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) , both  in Maine and 
beyond. Most big changes to  how we manage our waste have come when the s tatus quo is no longer tenable, 
through  progressive regulatory changes  and groundswells of public reaction. For example, ocean dumping was 
once prevalent but was banned after debris began fouling the shore, and in some cases bec ame a navigation al 
hazard. Ocean dumping of sludge was also abandoned after studies showed that the sludge was negatively  

2 
 
altering our coastal  ecosystems , one of Maine’s  greatest resources . At least with respect to MSW management 
in the US , change often proceeds as follows : 1) status quo ; 2) one or more problems cannot be denied and 
citizens become engage d; 3) regulators create a deadline for change; 4) the deadline arrives and a crisis is 
declared; 5) there is a scramble for solutions  but the short time frame means they are often incomplete ; 6) a 
solution is put in place  that works for the short term . 
Today in Maine we’re confronted with yet another moment in history when the symptoms of an unsustainable 
system have risen to a more prominen t place in public consciousness.  It is a moment  when we must  decide 
whether to continue to  “manage waste ” or to draw upon our  strong history  of environmental leadership, 
“waste -not” culture  and uniqu e version of entrepreneurialism  to design solutions that  eliminate  waste , 
capitalize on  valuable materials,  and spur economic development.  This is an opportunity for us all to educate  
and engage each other to  create  a more sustainable system . 
II. A History of Waste Management in Maine  
We begin with a brief history of waste managemen t in Maine . The saying “history repeats itself” rings true in 
relation to solid waste . Indeed our history is characterized  by a cycle of intermittent crises, partial soluti ons and 
periods of complacency.  
After World War II , many municipal ities began covering  their open dumps with soil (daily cover). This practice 
put an end to the nuisance factor of t own dumps (reduced fires, and animal issues such as seagulls and rats ) 
(Daniel 1993) . For decades there were several waste crises and concern s about  garbage volume, water pollution 
and toxicity as environmental awareness  increased. During the 1960s and 1970s various recycling programs 
were started  including the first bottle dep osit legislatio n in the US . During the 1980s , concern mounted  over the 
continue d use of unlined  landfills in  many municipalities. Due to changes in the composition of waste, landfills 
were becoming increasingly complex and toxic.  Traditional dumps did not have  engineering features to prevent 
groundwater contamination. In response, the US EPA enacted the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in 
1976 . The Act set a deadline f or the closure of inadequate and unsanitary  landfills  and put in place strict 
engineering requirements for all new facilities . While a significant step forward  to prevent pollution and 
including a focus on source reduction and resource recovery, the act created a crisis of sorts at state and local 
level s as municipalities began searchi ng for new homes for their MSW.  
The resulting wave of activity in Maine includ ed construction of sanitary landfills designed to meet EPA 
engineering requirements, the construction of several of waste -to-energy (WTE) facilities  and the start of 
recycling programs.  The Mid -Maine Waste Action Corporation ( MMWAC ) was formed in 1986  and completed 
refurbishing their facility in Auburn in 1992 , the Maine Energy Recovery Company ( MERC ) built a  WTE plant in 
Biddeford in 1987 , ecomaine , originally Regional Waste System s, built a WTE plant in Portland in 1988, and the  
Penobscot Energy Recovery Company  (PERC ) built  one in Orrington of the same year . In 1989 Maine created the 
Maine W aste Management Agency  and charged it with creating a solid waste management plan, assisting 
municipalities and businesses in waste reduction and recycling efforts, and developing criteria for the selection 
of new landfills . Perhaps most importantly , the state established a recycling  goal of 50 percent, developed 
various assistance programs including an infrastructure grant program and educational efforts, and adopted a 
waste management hierarchy (38 MRSA §2101)  which prioritized efforts to ensure waste reduction before  
recycling , waste -to-energy  and landfilling (in that order).  
In an effort to support the hierarchy, Maine emerged as a national leader in product stewardship progr ams and 
was among the first to implement stewardship requirements for mercury and batteries . The state also provided 
assistance to municipalities to improve recyclin g and materials recovery rates.  Combined with waste to energy 
programs , these efforts contr ibuted to reductions in waste production and landfilling rates.  Disposal of waste to 
a landfill has decreased from 89 percent of total waste in 1980 to less than  54 percent of MSW in 2012.  Solid 
waste generation per person per day peaked in 2000  in the US  and the recycling rate has increased –from less 
than 10 percent of MSW generated in 1980 to over 34 percent in 2012  (Figure s 2,3,4, & 5 ). 
3 
 
Today, m ost Maine communities do have more organized household collection  with increases in the amount of 
curbside collection of waste and recycling , but recycling rates have stagnated and little additional progress has 
been made in meeting Maine’s recycling goal of 50%  (Figure 2) . Indeed , Maine has struggled to find new ways to 
improve solid waste management practices  since the mid -1990s and many argue that the waste hierarchy is not 
being adequately suppor ted with policy or investment.  Seeing slow  progress towards the 50% recycling goal, 
stakeholders have increasingly questioned whether or not it is the right goal, or  if significant changes must be 
made to overcome the barriers that are preventing its accomplishment. This is in contrast to  national trends  
showing  stabilized  waste production rates p er capita . This can be seen as  a plateau of total waste generation 
along  with  increasing recycling rates at the national level  (Figure 4 , 5).

Complicating planning for the waste hierarchy at the state level , the two state agencies which have help ed to  set 
goals for solid waste management have both been eliminated. The Maine Waste Management Agency Act was 
repealed in 1995, and the State Planning  Office closed in July of 2012 . These changes in Maine’s policy and 
departmental priorities have added considerable uncertainty to the direction of solid waste regulation and 
planning for the state.  The Department of Environmental Protection is now tasked with Solid Waste data 
collection and reporting, but their  role as regulators could impact their ability to  direct solid waste planning for 
the state.  
The current era may  be coming to an  end as  history repeats itself and public interest in MSW policy is onc e again 
rising , due to an impending crisis and deadline.  Maine Energy Recovery Company’s (MERC) WTE facility  in 
Biddeford closed at the end of 2012, taking with it more than one third of the state’s waste WTE  capacity.  In 
2018 the waste -to-energy plant, P enobscot Energy Recovery Company (PERC), will lose  favorable electrical  rates 
for the energy  they produce.  Together MERC and PERC  represent ed 72% of the state’s  waste -to-energy  capacity 
prior to 2012.  If PERC were to  close, a significant increase in landfilling may be necessary in the absence of 

4 
 
alternative  technologies or aggressive waste reduction programs . Yet increased landfilling is inconsistent with  
Maine ’s waste hierarchy that places waste processing to reduce volume (i.e. WTE  and potentially new 
technologies ) at a higher priority level than landfilling.  
One of the PERC owners is the Municipal Review Committee (MRC), a  nonprofit organization composed of the 
187 eastern Maine municipalities that generate much of the waste PERC receives. As part of the MRC effort to 
identify alternatives  for disposal of their MSW post -2018 , the organization proposed siting a new landfill at one 
of two sites in Argyle or Greenbush, Maine. While the State of Maine , through the M aine  DEP, would deny  both 
MRC landfill location requests , the proposals sparked significant public protest and brought  waste management 
back into the public conscious ness . Meanwhile other municipalities, struggling to find adequate room in their 
budgets to manage waste, find proposals to subsidize waste -to-energy  unfair given that  WTE  may  not be 
accessible to all municipalities.  
The history of MSW management leads us t o look at both  the challenges and opportunities associated with our 
current system of waste management and the  potentially  historical moment in which we find ourselves.  
III. Defining Challenges and Opportunities  
Meeting  the goals of Maine’s waste hierarchy may  be difficult without new technologies, renewed support for 
waste -to-energy , and significant  declines in waste generation  or policy to  restructure landfill incentives . In this 
section we outline our understanding of the challenges associated with Maine’ s current MSW system, including 
our co ntinued reliance on landfills . 
Waste management and the economy  
The state of Maine currently owns three landfill  sites: Juniper Rid ge in Old Town (operated by Casella);  Dolby  
Landfill  in East M illinocket;  and undeveloped  Carpenter Ridge  in Lincoln. M aine also has five municipal ly-owned  
landfills  (Hatch -Hill in Augusta, Bath, Brunswick, Presque Isle, and Tri -Community in Fort -Fairfield ), two ash 
landfills for WTE  residue  (ecomaine’s and Lewiston) , one commercial ly owned and operated  landfill  (Crossroads 
in Norridgewock owned by Waste Management) , and two  larger  waste remediation and  Construction and 
Demolition Debris (CDD) disposal sites  (Mid Coast Solid Waste in Rockport and Rockland) . As of 2013 , the 
remaining landfill capacity for MSW was 9.4 million cubic yards (Maine DEP 2015 ). That number could 
potentially increase if landfill expansion proposals expected in the summer of 2015  are approved  and with the 
legislative rules regarding commercial landfills being changed . If approved and at current disposal rates , these 
expansions  would increase the states capacity beyond 20 years , though some la ndfills would fill sooner.  This 
time frame would be further compressed with the closure of PERC if no agreeable alternatives  to direct 
landfilling are identified.  
The siting of new landfills  and the expansion of existing sites are difficult  due, most obviously, to local opposition  
to perceived environmental  and operational issues , but also to a host of other reasons including geography and 
economics. For example, large landfills benefit from economies of scale as large amounts of waste can offset the 
high costs associated with siting  and development , constru ction and operati ons. It would be prohibitively 
expensive for all but Maine’s largest municipalities to have individual landfills. But large landfills must be 
regional in order to obtain sufficient MSW. This is a problem for our largely rural state, howeve r, since 
geography and infrastructure can make transportation cost -prohibitive for many municipalities if the landfills are  
far from population centers.  
Another economic complication concerns contemporary incentives for landfill operators . To ensure adequa te 
cash flow for operations, landfill operators  may  have a n incentive to secure more volume and to fill at a rapid 
rate. When analyzing landfill closure timelines, such as with Mid -Coast Solid Waste and the City of Bath’s landfill, 
the least -cost alternati ve found was to fill the landfill expediently and close it , but that would not be the 
appropriate option given the needs of the region they serve . These models were based on many social and 
economic  assumptions. There are other factors such as the ability to have a controllable local landfill that isn’t 
quantifiable. Landfills also settle over time as methane, carbon -dioxide, and water are released and allow for a 
5 
 
cubic yard of waste today to not occupy that same space in the future. In terms of general fin ance it is also 
known that a dollar today is worth more than future dollars. These factors increase the complexity of landfill 
planning and operation.  
Waste to energy facilities  are, as we all know, another option but  these too can only exist if they can compete  
economically  with other means of disposing of waste. Being tied to a volatile energy market s leads to a great 
deal of uncertainty. Materials recovery facilities have the same risks due to extreme fluctuations in the prices of 
materials. Corrugated cardboard, for example, reached prices of over $200 a ton in recent history, but has 
historically aver aged closer to $70 a ton.  
Recycling  and capturing materials are  important strategies for waste diversion;  they also come with a price. 
Transporting two st reams can be costly in rural areas where there are lower volumes. Composting facilities have 
perceptions of odor that make it difficult to gain community support. Larger facilities could be more cost 
efficient, but guaranteeing adequate materials inflow pr ior to construction would prove difficult. That type of 
price fluctuation makes planning difficult for facilities and brokers that sell recovered materials.  There are also 
concerns about the distances materials (waste, recycling, and other) must travel.  Many bailed recyclable 
materials end up in places far away, sometimes across the globe. The local transfer station or recycling center 
was a hub for the consolidation of materials, but with the number of communities that have curbside recycling 
and some fo rm of single stream recycling increasing, the road miles of these collected materials has increased. 
Diversion technologies also require large capital investments that individual communities or regions often 
cannot afford by themselves. Private companies h ave an important role to play in this form of regionalization; 
allowing for coordination between communities and markets at lower costs.  
Alternative incentive structures could potentially be created to address these economic challenges , but waste 
disposal  also present s longer term ecological and public health risks . 
Waste management  and environmental health   
Landfills  have been a key part of the waste disposal system,  but result in  several long -term ecological challenges 
ranging from land allocation and potential engineering failures to leachate treatment and the production of 
green house gasses.  Policy makers have recognized the scarcity of suitable landfill sites, writing “ The Legislature 
finds that environmentally suitable sites for w aste disposal are in limited supply and represent a critical natural 
resource. ” (M.R.S. Title 38 Chapter 13  §1302 ) 
Ideal sites for landfills in Maine are limited given the state’s surficial geology and landscape .  Some of the better 
locations, far away from vulnerable water resources , are also far away from population centers making 
transportation cost s an issue of concern . Once landfills are approved, with today’s requirements that moisture 
and air be excluded, waste materials in a landfill slowly decay , producing  gasses and leachate that  may be 
released  into our air and water.  Air emissions from landfills primarily consist of Carbon dioxide (CO2), met hane, 
malodorous compounds, and other organic compounds ( US EPA 1995 ) which contribute to air quality problems. 
Impacts of landfill leachate include the pollution of ground and surface water s and the energy and chemicals 
associated with treating collected  leachate.  
These risks are present even for new landfills constructed to modern standards using best engineering practices. 
Landfills  present legacy problems f or the state and its citizenry.  Already approximately 12% of the closed 
municipal landfills in Maine have been identified as environment ris ks as defined by the Maine DEP.   Even 
modern engineered landfills must be monitored over the long -term to safeguard human health and the 
environment. The US EPA requires that the care period for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills for non -hazardous 
wast es be 30 years post -closure ( US EPA 2014 ) but Dr. G. Fred Lee  and associates , a landfill engineer ing and 
environmental consulting group , states that a 30 year post -closure period “ has essentially no relationship to the 
period during which the wastes in the lan dfill will pose a threat to public health/welfare or environmental 
quality .” (Jones -Lee & Lee 2014 ). 
6 
 
Waste -to-energy  also ha s environmental impacts.  While many mechanisms and technologies have been  put in 
place to ensure  emissions meet  regulated air quality levels  and to detoxify ash , particularly since the  Clean Air 
Act of 1970 , ther e are still emissions . Many communities object to the odors associated with  some  WTE facilities  
and the extra layer of processing also requires significant tr ansportation and ash disposal.  
Challenges and Opportunities at (and in) the Home  
Landfill and WTE  operators  provide an essential service for the benefit of a citizenry that produces significant 
waste  (approximately 3 pounds per -person -per-day in Maine ). While it is true that both absolute and per capita 
waste generation ha s declined in Maine over the l ast decade, it is also clear that even these reduced  levels of 
waste generation will require new solutions  (Maine DEP  2013 ). Whil e the best sol utions will include a mix of 
these elements and a strong systemic approach, research suggests that the most economic and resource 
efficient solutions (the low -hanging fruit, so to speak) are found not at the end of the lifecycle, but rather up the 
supply c hain in design modifications or in consumer behavioral modifications  (West Coast Forum on Materials 
Management) .  
A 2011 study by the University of Maine and State Planning Office ( Criner  & Blackmer  2011 ) found that 20% of 
baggable household waste  (after recycli ng) gathered from 17 municipalities  in Maine  was recyclable, and more 
nota bly, that 40% was compostable. This raises significant questions about waste that might be avoided through 
the encouragement of changes in household behaviors (meal planning, re -evaluation of “best by” dates, food 
sharing, house hold composting etc.).  The elimination of food waste and composting keeps valuable nutrients 
circulating and reduces waste tonnages and  landfill -associated emissions.  According to several studies, waste 
prevent ion and food waste composting offer the greatest potential for waste reduction (West Coast Forum 
2014,  Cox et al. 20 10). 
Information and (dis)incentives can often times be effective, but researchers have long noted a gap between 
environmental awareness, attitudes and behaviors ( Thorgeson and Olander 20 03).  In order to increase 
household participation in waste reduction these practices must also be convenient (Mueller 2013, Wilk 2009).  
Municipalities  have also recognized the need for convenience, leading to a vast increase in communities using  
curbside r ecycling and either  single -strea m or zero -sort™ for recycling . While single stream can have significant 
benefits, it can also increase the distances that materia ls are transported and can break down local community 
and regional efforts . The significant inv estment required for single stream materials recovery facilities mean that 
they are often  centralized in urban centers.  
Another alternative designed to reduce household waste is Pay -As-You-Throw (PAYT).  These programs have 
also grown in popularity in rece nt years . In 2006 , the EPA reported that there are over 7,000 communities in the 
US with PAYT  (Skumatz  2006 ). PAYT programs may be perceived as  controversial and often fought by citizens. 
The research on PAYT is mixed, with some reporting significant waste reduction  near 50% (EPA 2010 , individual 
municipalities ; Brewer , Sanford ). Other researchers finding that  while there are substantial impacts, they  are not 
only due to PAYT, but also are  due to other important factors  such as: demographics; available program s; 
current economic conditions; etc.  (Blackmer & Criner 2014 ; Allers 2010 , Ferrera 2005 ). Finally some studies 
suggest that reductions  in waste from PAYT may be  small and heavily  undermined  by illegal dumping, waste 
“shifting”, “leakage” or “tourism” since those who wish to avoid paying also have an incentive to take their 
waste to other municipalities (Fullerton 1996 ).   
While economic (dis)i ncentives like PAYT often shift behaviors in the short term , critics argue that  they  often fail 
to produce long term chang e if the incentive is removed. These findings suggest that while one -dimensional 
change models like awareness campaigns and financial incentives have enjoyed significant popularity, their 
effects have been limited if our goal is to affect long -term and comprehensive behavioral change.  Strategies to 
promote household waste reduction need to create strong multi -dimensional programs that e nsure awareness, 
convenience, and incentives but that also help to build strong social environments, shared values and structural 
support through complimentary programs such as extended producer responsibility, strong prevention targets 
7 
 
and community -based  collaborations between the public and private sectors ( Cox et  al. 2010 ). Certainly the 
optimal package of programs utilized is likely to be a  product of the specific traits of the community.  
IV. Moving Toward Sustainable  Materials Management in Maine  
The cre ation of a waste hierarchy  in Maine marked an important shift toward sustainable materials 
management and an attempt to create a more efficient, sustainable and resourceful state economy.  But we are 
still wasting materials and nutrients of significant val ue. While systems that can capture this value require 
significant  investment, they can reduce long term costs and boost local, regional and state economies in t he long 
term.  
Waste -to-energy  proved an important step toward reducing  the volume of  waste  generated prior to  end 
disposal . The benefit is that it both generates revenue from the creation of electricity while reducing the volume 
of the waste to be landfilled by approximately 90% . WTE  remains an important part o f waste management in 
our state. The current technological landscape for WTE facilities in Maine  is between mass -burn systems and 
refuse -derived fuel systems (RDF). While ecomaine a nd (MMWAC) both use mass burn technology, PERC is an 
RDF. Mass burn technologies have proven to be more cost effective over time  as capital costs per ton of capacity 
are higher and there are additional processing costs for RDF facilities according to the United Nations 
Environmental Programme . 
New and emerging waste stream management technologies have the potential to create a great deal of 
improvement  in the future of managing waste . These te chnologies have the capability  of treating the waste as a 
resource and not a burden. However, these technologies are still subject to the same issues surrounding 
transportation, economies of scale , and Maine’s low population  density outside of th e Portland area. Their place 
in Maine’s waste hierarchy  is also uncertain as they have complex processes. The most pressing concern in the 
DEP 5 year plan is removing org anics from the waste stream. The use of Anaerobic Digestion , dry fermentation, 
or larger scale composting facilities  to remove organics from the waste stream would accomplish the organics 
diversion objective from the 5 year plan , but significant capital an d transportation barriers exist. Maine has one 
fully operation digester in Exeter with a couple in the preliminary planning phase with the future uncertain.  
The Municipal Review Committee’s  proposed waste processing facility is an emerging technology that has 
interesting implications and potential. A report by Pendse et  al. has a review of the proposed technologies. 
Fiberight is still in its infancy , but offers promising chemical and biological processes to produce various types of 
fuels from the waste. Whether or not the Fiberight plant gets built and what  levels  products and residuals it 
creates is sti ll uncertain . On existing landfills, the capture of methane for combustion has become more 
common. There also exist several places where solar fields are being set up  on top of closed landfills to utilize  
the space to create renewable energy. One example o f this is Casella’s landfill in Coventry, Vermont which is 
projected to produce over 3,000 mega -watt hours of electricity per year  (Gerlat 2 014). 
The development and implementation of waste techn ologies that are efficient, cost -effective a nd allow us to 
reduce the amount landfill ed, capture valuable materials and nutrients and contribute to new economic activity 
are certainly  desirable on mult iple levels. Our discussions with stakeholders from various areas of waste 
management in Maine sug gest this is the case.  But the incentive structures, processes, capital investments, 
public pressure and responsive leadership required to usher in such signi ficant investments and transition s are 
not currently in place.  
V. Learning and Leading: Drawing inspiration and Leading the Way   
At the national level , federal guidance  continues to advocate a roadmap, outlined in  the document ‘Sustainable  
Materials Management: The Road Ahead' ( US EPA 2009 ). This approach focuses  on creating prosperity  using 
fewer materials .  Wide arrays of policy tools are  available to ensure more sustainable and efficient materials 
management practices and a movement toward a n economy that wastes ver y little . 
These policies are increasingly seen as an opportunity for both savings and new funding streams.  The Ellen 
MacAurt hur Foundation’s report Towards the Circular Economy: Opportunities for the Consumer Goods Sector  
8 
 
(MacAurthur 2013 ) draws on analysis from McKinsey to est imate additional incom e of $1.5 billion annually if 
municipalities collected food waste from households to produce biogas or return nutrients to the soil.   Drawing 
on analysis of the value embodied in products from multiple sectors (e.g. used clothing, appliances) the report 
estimates that we are currently wasting $2.6 trillion  every year.  The authors calculate that the full potential of a 
circular economy could result in material savings worth as much as $700 billion annually.   Further, the 
development of industry to support  materials collection and processing has significant job creation potential 
(MacA urthur 2013 ). The European Environment Agency  (2013) writes, “If a country is to generate greater 
economic returns at lower costs to the environment then it must find ways to extract more value from the 
resources that it takes from nature, while cutting the burden of emissio ns and waste.”  
Some govern ments have made significant steps to ensure that materials management adhere s to their waste 
hierarchy.  In the European Union , for example, the hierarchy is  integrated into the European Commission's 
Roadmap on a resource efficient Europe ( EC 2011 ) and the EU's Waste Framework Directive (EU 2008 ). As part 
of the circular economy package the EU has adopted a  legislative proposal that is projected to create 180,000 
new jobs while making Europe more competitive and reduce demand for  increasingly scarce resources.  It aims 
to increase recycling and reuse of municipal waste to 70% by 2030 and to reduce food waste by 30% and phase 
out landfilling for recyclables  by 2025.  
Together these dire ctives have prompted many countries such as Austria, the Netherlands and Germany to 
virtually eliminate landfilling . As a result the EU reduce d landfilled waste by nearly 20 perce nt between 2001 and 
2011 ( Cox et  al. 2013 ). Impl emented policies in the EU, other US states and beyond range from the educational 
and voluntary to incentive -based soft policies and hard m andates.  While Maine is certainly unique in many ways 
and leadership in materials management can certainly take a variety of forms, it is wise to look toward 
implemented programs in other locales to evaluate costs, benefits and suitability for our state.  
Educational and Voluntary Programs:  
A variety of programs have been put in place to encourage more sustainable behaviors through e ducation and 
consumer “nudges”.  One interesting example is the EPA’s “ Food too Good to Waste ” program which provides 
cities with a “toolkit”  which includes educational materials and motivational challenges to engage households in 
food waste prevention. According to the program an average household in the US can save $1600 annually by 
reducing food waste alone . Compos ting can also cut down on t he $750 million Americans spend each year to 
landfill waste  and reduce the 14% of US greenhouse gas emissions associated with food waste  (West Coast 
Forum 2014 ). 
Incentives:  
While several studies  have illustrated that voluntary programs are much less effective , they are less politically 
contentious and not as deeply unpopular a s hard restrictions on choice. Many scholars have shown that a 
desirable  middle ground can be found in policies that provi de economic incentives or disinc entives for desirable 
actions.  The European Environmental Agency  has suggested, for example, that landfill fees  can play an 
important role  in incentivizing  a shift up the waste hierarchy . Maine was an early leader in the development of 
policies  designed to incentivize waste reduction and m aterials recovery.  The “bottle bill”, a container deposit 
program was enacted i n 1976 and implemented in  1978.  The system, still in place, makes a significant 
contribution to recycling rates . 
 
In many municipalities  PAYT  programs have been put in place to give households an economic dis incen tive for 
generating waste.  The requirement to purchase bags or stickers for collection provides households with the 
incentive to remain mindful of wa ste and reduce costs.  Several studies suggest that these programs are largely 
successful though uncertainties remain about the perception  to which these programs contribute  to illegal 
dumping practices.  
Mandates:  
Many  states and national governments have gone further than vol untary programs and incentives to restrict 
personal choice in th e favor of the public interest.  While di sposal bans, purchasing requirements, mandatory 
9 
 
recycling and composting ordinances and product stewardship requirements often meet hard political 
resis tance , they can be  extremely effective. Not only do they result in significant improvements , but they can 
drive  innovation.  
Vermont ’s 2012 legislation  is an ex ample of an extremely pr oactive movement toward sustainable materials 
management. The state has required the “univer sal recycling of solid waste.” The act bans disposal of 
recyclables by July 1, 2015; leaf and yard debris and clean wood by July 1, 2016; an d food scraps by July 1, 2020. 
It also requires solid waste haulers and facilities to collect these same materials.  The legislation also requires 
waste characterization and feasibility studies as well as the development of marketing potential for materials. 
Vermont is able to be aggressive with their food waste due to the high quantity of anaerobic digesters located in 
the state. Vermont and Maine are not identical and there are different barriers and opportunities predicated on 
geography,  available  facilities, and politic al en vironment . 
Other states that also have landfill bans of recyclables include  Massachusetts , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Michigan, 
and North Carolina. Some cities, such as Seattle, and states like Connecticut, have crea ted mandatory recycling 
laws that level fines against citizens who throw away  certain recyclable materials. California  has also recently 
succeeded in passing SB 270  a plastic bag ban that prohibits grocery and convenience stores from providing free 
plastic bags after July 1, 2015 . 
Beyond landfill bans many governments have targeted actors further up the supply chain. British Columbia’s 
Environmental Management  Act ( B.C. Reg. 449/2004 & 88/2014 ) has enacted a single “results -based framework 
that engages industry in new ways by shifting responsibility for environmentally  sound product end -of-life 
management and recycling to producers and consumers”.  As such British Columbia  requires producers of 
regulated products to submit stewardship plans before they may sell their product s in the province. Currently 
the act includes ; universals such as batteries and mercury switches but has also been expanded in recent years 
to include televisions, printers, smoke  detectors and hand held devices.  
Maine became a national leader in the establishment of product stewardship programs . It was among the first 
to implement stewardship requirements for mercury and batteries and now the program  also includes 
electronic waste and cellular phones. Paint will be added as o f April 1, 2015 and other products such as 
mattresses and carpets are under consideration.  The DEP website states that, “Maine's Product Stewardship 
Framework law affirms product stewardship programs as an integral part of the State’s solid waste manageme nt 
strategy…This process provides the opportunity for municipalities, manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and 
non-governmental organizations to provide their input into the establishment and revision of product 
stewardship programs in Maine ,” (Maine’s Product Stewardship Program ). 
Comparative studies of landfilling and recycling rates show the importance of using multiple instruments and a 
systemic appr oach to materials management.  
VI. Engaging Diverse Stakeholders in the Generation of Solutions  
Finding solutions to solid waste problems requires the involvement of many people with different areas of 
expertise, including citizens,  solid waste professionals  communit ies, engineers,  policy makers, and scientists.  We 
cannot come up with sustainable solutions if some stakeholders a re left out of the discussion. That said, it can 
be enormously challenging to bring people together who do not share the same goals, history, or perspectives 
on soli d waste.  We need to find ways to draw together that diverse knowledge to come up with an integrated 
solution.  
Maine is being looked to as a model by other states because we are increasingly discovering ways to bring 
diverse groups together to come up with solutions on contentious topics. The University of Maine, through such 
activities as the Sustainability Solutions Initiative, has tested out ways that the university can be a helpful 
convener and partner on bringing together research and action on tough en vironmental issues.  
10 
 
The Maine Policy Review issue  on environmental issues is filled with examples of how policy makers, 
researchers, and stakeholders are being successfully brought  together to design solutions. Strategies described 
that we could draw on in solid waste discussions include:  
 How to work at the local, county, and regional level  
 How to find out if people want to work together and in what ways  
 How to involve groups that hav en’t been able to communicate with each other in the past  
 How to bring to gether people who have spent various amounts of time with a topic  
 How to deal with a history of conflict  
 How to take into account economic issues, environmental issues, and social issues  
 How to deal with complex topics with a history of failed attempts to resolve  them  
The kinds of solutions include:  product stewardship policies;  public edu cation and engagement campaigns;  
increased regional planning and coordination ; landfill assessm ent fees ; investments in developing markets for 
recyclables ; investments in innovative new technologies that increase diversion or byp roducts of solid waste 
disposal;  partnerships  to redesign local manufacturing capacity so that reco vered materials can be utilized ; and 
assistant programs such as grant funding for local improvements . 
The right combination is certainly influenced by local context , but in general  studies show that those 
governments using a broad range of instrument have higher levels of waste diversion than those with relativel y 
few or no policy instruments . 
VII. Conclusion   
In this paper we have offered perspectives regarding  the complexities that surround managing waste. The 
history of solid waste management is not one of zero progress; in fact a great deal of progress has been made 
with managing solid waste in the past thirty years. Thirty years ago lining a landfill and havi ng a recycling 
operation was ground -breaking, today it is viewed as a bare minimum. Although waste generation rates per 
capita have plateaued, recycling rates have remained stable . Waste management is an essential facet of society, 
but it is an increasingl y costly endeavor. Suitable landfill space near population centers are limited and therefore 
a precious resource to the state. Economic and environmental factors should weigh heavily into our materials 
management decision making process. The challenges and  opportunities that are currently present for solid 
waste management in Maine require thoughtful, thorough analysis and discourse before action is taken. New 
technologies, regionalization, economic (dis)incentives, increased convenience for households, and  other 
influences create opportunities for towns to improve their outcomes in managing trash, recycling, and other 
diverted materials. Government guidelines, policies, goals, and mandates can be utilized to direct municipal 
actions in how to determine what  the appropriate way to manage their individual waste stream is. The ability of 
the many and diverse stakeholders to join forces and come to level of collective action not previously achieved 
may yield an increase in group knowledge, help overcome long -standing divides, and inspire improved 
outcomes. These possibilities are a starting point to bring all parties to the table to discuss how Maine can 
achieve the best possible outcome for the leftover waste/resources that we accumulate throughout the course 
of daily life.  
Maine is at a crossroads with solid waste (materials) management. We know that solid waste issues are bigger 
than one community or municipality, and technical and policy issues are complex. The Mitchell Center  can play a 
unique role in bridgin g the traditional barriers  by working in partnership with the various stakeholders. Such an 
approach has had considerable success in other controversial areas in Maine including forestry, agriculture, 
urbanization, coastal systems, alternative energy, fres hwater quality, and more. The Mitchell Center envisions 
leading a process where the various stakeholders work in an iterative and collaborative process that combines 
the vast wealth of knowledge and experience of the various individuals involved (waste man agement 
professionals, municipal and regional planners and managers, private companies, state officials, citizens, 
environmental and advocacy groups, universities, and other interested parties).

2                       Maine Materials Management Plan . . .   
I. Executive Summary  
 
This update to the Maine Solid Waste Management and Recycling Plan is undertaken every five 
years, in accordance with 38 MRSA §2122 and must provide g uidance and direction to municipalities 
in planning and implementing waste management and recycling programs at the state, regional and 
local levels .  In addition, the Plan is to incorporate changes in waste generation trends, changes in 
waste recycling and disposal technologies, development of new waste generating activities and other 
factors affecting solid waste management as the Department finds appropriate .  This Plan updat e 
also includes the 2012 Waste Generation and Disposal Capacity Report, which is the source for 
much of the current data referred to within the Plan.  
 
The Department views this Plan as the opportunity to provide information to municipalities and 
other soli d waste managers on current efforts and other activities supporting the state’s solid waste 
management hierarchy.  This includes information on reduction, recycling, beneficial use, and 
conversion technologies, as well as the cost of solid waste services.  
 
An Advisory Committee, made up of public, private and non -profit solid waste program and policy 
managers, was convened by the Department to assist in this Plan’s development and content.  The 
committee members received background documents on various topi cs and participated in two 
meetings.  A listing of the Advisory Committee members may be found in Appendix A.  The 
Department thanks the members for their participation and input to this Plan’s update.  
 
Priorities determined by the Department, with assista nce from the Advisory Committee, are detailed 
in the Plan.  Some of the priorities are unchanged from past plans, e.g., ‘increase amount of 
materials recycled’ and ‘increase collection and use of organic residuals’.  There are also several new 
priorities, reflecting changing technologies and options now available to municipalities and 
businesses, including ‘conversion technologies’.  
 
The Plan includes strategies and actions for the Department and solid waste management entities to 
be accomplished in the ne xt five years, including short -term changes and groundwork for longer -
term opportunities with capital investments that may require a longer period for return on 
investment.

II. Vision and Purpose   
 
The 2014 Maine Materials Management Plan includes strategies and actions to foster a continued 
shift toward a holistic system of materials management  in Maine.  Such an approach takes a broad 
view, and addresses the management of materials and products thr ough their complete lifecycles, 
rather than focusing solely on management at the end of life (e.g. disposal).  The materials 
management approach recognizes the full range of opportunities that exist throughout these 
lifecycles, from product design and manu facturing to reuse and recycling, in order to conserve 
resources, foster sustainability and minimize environmental impacts.   
 
This Plan is based on  the priorities of Maine’s Solid Waste Management Hierarchy (38 MRS 
§2101(1)) and furthers the hierarchy’s p olicy to “ plan for and implement an integrated approach to solid waste 
management for solid waste generated in this State and solid waste imported into this State . . .” The Plan includes 
strategies  to enhance the State’s waste reduction and diversion effo rts, consistent with policy 
articulated in Maine law (38 MRS §2101(2) ).  The Plan builds upon the 2009 Maine Waste 
Management and Recycling Plan and the successes that have been achieved in such areas as 
recycling, beneficial use, toxics reduction and exte nded producer responsibility.   
 
The Department envisions continuing: movement toward comprehensive sustainable materials 
management in Maine, focus on adherence to the principles of the Solid Waste Management 
Hierarchy in the development and implementatio n of programs and waste management systems, and 
expansion of waste reduction and diversion efforts.  
 
The purpose of the 2014 Maine Materials Management Plan is to provide information, guidance and 
direction to municipalities, regions, businesses and others , regarding the status, development and 
implementation of sustainable materials management and waste management programs at the state, 
regional and local levels.  The Plan identifies state priorities and establishes an action plan for the 
next 5 years, inc luding strategies and actions through which the state can support the materials 
management, waste diversion, and recycling efforts of municipalities, regions and businesses.  
Maine statute (38 MRS §2122) provides that:  
 
“The department shall prepare an analysis of, and a plan for, the management, reduction and recycling of solid waste 
for the State.   The plan must be based on the priorities and recycling goals established in sections 2101 and 2132.  
The plan must provide guidance and direction to municip alities in planning and implementing waste management and 
recycling programs at the  state, regional and local levels.”  
 
Specifically, the statute (38 MRS §2123 -A) requires that the following elements be part of the plan:  
 
“1. Waste characterization .  The s tate plan must be based on a comprehensive analysis of solid waste 
generated, recycled and disposed of in the State.   Data collected must include, but not be limited to, the source, 
type and amount of waste currently generated; and the costs and types of w aste management employed 
including recycling, composting, landspreading, incineration or landfilling.  
2. Waste reduction and recycling assessment .  The state plan must include an assessment of the 
extent to which waste generation could be reduced at the s ource and the extent to which recycling can be 
increased.  
  
Maine Department of Environmental Protection  
4                       Maine Materials Management Plan . . .   
3. Determination of existing and potential disposal capacity .  The state plan must identify 
existing solid waste disposal and management capacity within the State and the potential for expansion of  
that capacity.  
4. Projected demand for capacity .  The state plan must identify the need in the State for current and 
future solid waste disposal capacity by type of solid waste, including identification of need over the next 5 -year, 
10-year and 20 -year p eriods.”  
 
The law provides that the analysis is to be revised by January 1, 2014 and every 5 years thereafter, to 
incorporate changes in waste generation trends, changes in waste recycling and disposal 
technologies, development of new waste generating act ivities and other factors affecting solid waste 
management as the department finds appropriate . 
 
The plan is based on the priorities and policies of the Solid Waste Management Hierarchy found at 
38 MRS §2101:  
 
“Priorities .  It is the policy of the State to  plan for and implement an integrated approach to solid waste 
management for solid waste generated in this State and solid waste imported into this State, which must be 
based on the following order of priority:  
A. Reduction of waste generated at the sourc e, including both amount and toxicity of the waste;  
B. Reuse of waste;  
C. Recycling of waste;  
D. Composting of biodegradable waste;  
E. Waste processing that reduces the volume of waste needing land disposal, including incineration; 
and  
F. Land disposal of waste.  
  
It is the policy of the State to use the order of priority in this subsection as a guiding principle in making 
decisions related to solid waste management.  
 
Waste reduction and diversion.   It is the policy of the state to actively pro mote and encourage waste 
reduction measures from all sources and maximize waste diversion efforts by encouraging new and expanded 
uses of solid waste generated in this State as a resource.”  
 
The Plan  is also based upon the State recycling and waste r educti on goals found at 38 MRS §2132:  
  
“State recycling goal.  It is the goal of the State to recycle or compost, by January 1, 2014, 50% of the 
municipal solid waste  tonnage generated each year within the State.  
  
State waste reduction goal .  It is the goal of  the State to reduce the biennial generation of municipal 
solid waste  tonnage by 5% beginning on January 1, 2009 and by an additional 5% every subsequent 2 
years.  This reduction in solid waste tonnage, after January 1, 2009, is a biennial goal.   The basel ine for 
calculating this reduction is the 2003 solid waste generation data gathered by the former State Planning 
Office.”  
     
Although the State’s recycling and waste reduction goals are specific to the municipal solid waste 
(MSW) portion of Maine’s solid  waste stream, the Plan includes information on the recycling and 
beneficial uses of construction & demolition debris (CDD) and other solid wastes such as industrial 
wastes.

In addition to revising the State’s Solid Waste Management and Recycling Plan eve ry five years, the 
Department is also charged with preparing the Solid Waste Generation and Disposal  Capacity 
Report for the Legislature annually (38 MRS §2124 -A).  This report provides information on the 
statewide generation of solid waste, recycling rate s and solid waste disposal capacity, and an analysis 
of the relationship between available disposal capacity and disposal prices.  This year, the plan and 
the report have been combined into this single document.    
 
III. Solid Waste Generation and Characterizati on  
 
Solid waste is commonly categorized based on the type and source of the waste.  Municipal solid 
waste (MSW) is waste that is typically generated by households and commercial businesses.  The 
industrial sector also generate s significant amounts of solid wastes that are regulated as “special 
waste” under Maine law because they have chemical or physical properties that make them difficult 
to handle or potentially pose a threat to public health, safety or the environment.  ( See Appendix B 
for statutory  and regulatory definitions.)  
 
Maine’s solid waste management infrastructure includes municipal, commercial, and private 
industrial waste handling facilities.  Once collected, solid waste in Maine is stored, transported, 
recycled, processed, beneficially u sed in place of virgin materials  and as fuel , composted, digested, 
incinerated, and/or landfilled.  Table 1 presents a summary of the types and amounts of solid waste 
generated in Maine in 2012.

In 2011, the University of Maine undertook a study to understand the types of solid waste Maine 
residents are disposing of in the mixed MSW stream.  Figures 1 and 2 are reproduced from that 
report1 to sho w the percentages of MSW by material type that currently is disposed of in Maine.

Understan ding the composition of the MSW currently being landfilled or incinerated is critical to 
identifying the greatest opportunities for reducing MSW generation and increasing Maine’s MSW 
recycling rate.  The 2011 Maine Residential Waste Characterization Study  documented organics, paper 
and plastics as the three largest components in MSW disposed of from Maine.   Diversion of 
organics  from disposal r emains the largest opportunity to reduce Maine’s waste stream .   
 
IV. Managing Maine’s Solid Waste – Progress toward St ate Goals  
 
In keeping with the Solid Waste Management Hierarchy (38 MRS §2101), there are a variety of 
options employed for managing Maine’s solid waste.  Appendix C is a table that provides an 
overview of management options currently employed for the various components of Maine’s solid 
waste stream .  This table provides a qualitative assessment  of the comparative use of the 
management option s.  The options are grouped by levels on the Hierarchy, with those listed to the 
left preferable to those toward the right due to the resulting preservation and use of materials.  By

examining Maine’s waste stream by material type and current management options, we can identify 
opportunities for “moving up the hierarchy”, decreasing disposal and increasing waste redu ction, 
reuse, recycling and beneficial use.         
 
A. Maine’s Municipal Solid Waste Reduction Goal  
 
Maine’s statutory goals for waste reduction focus specifically on MSW.  38 MRS §2132(1 -A ) sets 
a State goal of reducing the biennial generation of municipal  solid waste tonnage by 5% 
beginning on January 1, 2009, and by an additional 5% every subsequent 2 years.  As Maine’s 
recycling rate has held steady over the past several years, t he State has experienced a reduction in 
the generation of MSW as reflected i n the amounts of MSW disposed of in landfills and waste -
to-energy incinerators.  While historic ally there has been a  positive correlation of MSW 
generation with activity in the overall economy , additional factors such as  manufacturers’ 
corporate sustainabi lity initiatives  that decreas e the amount of packaging associated w ith 
consumer goods may be having an increasing impact.      
 
In 2012, Maine residents generated and disposed of 0.537 tons (1,074 pounds)  of MSW per 
person.  Regional comparisons for 2010 show Mainers generated less MSW per person than any 
other New England state.

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Interstate Flow in 2010 , January 30, 2013, Northeast Waste 
Management Association ( www.newmoa.org ) 
 
 
The Department has been working with the Northeast Waste Management Officials’ 
Association  (NEWMOA)  to quantify and track the interstate flow of MSW  destined for disposal  
since 1999.  The data collected show that the amount of MSW (exclusive of CDD and WTE 
ash) disposed of by Maine residents  (both in -state and exported)  decreased from 755,086  tons in 
2008 to 713,713 ton s in 2012.  This is a 5.5% decrease in disposal of MSW in 4 years .

B. Maine’s Municipal Solid Waste Recycling Rate  
 
In 1989, the Maine Legislature enacted 38 MRS §2132, establishing a goal to recycle or compost 
50% of the state’s municipal solid waste annually.  The legislated date to achieve the goal was 
revised in 2012 and extended to January 1, 2014.  Individual municipal and regional recycling 
programs are not require d to achieve a 50% recycling rate, but they are required to demonstrate 
progress towards the goal.  The State remains committed to reaching the 50% goal in light of the 
value of reducing overall solid waste management costs, the positive impact on the envi ronment, 
and a lessening of the need for additional solid waste disposal capacity.   
 
The MSW  recycling rate is calculated  by dividing the total amount of MSW recycled by the total 
amount of  reported  in-state generated MSW  in accordance with 38 MRS §2132  (3).  The term 
“municipal solid waste” is not defined in Maine law, but has historically been interpreted as solid 
waste normally managed by municipalities  in Maine , including  CDD.  However, other states and 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)  exclude CDD from their calculations of 
MSW recycling rates .  This creates inconsistencies when trying to compare Maine’s calculated 
MSW recycling rate with the MSW recycling rates of other states.  To address this, the 
Department  has calculated the recycl ing rate for MSW as defined by EPA, and a separate 
recycling rate that includes  CDD.  This approach allows Maine to perform an apples -to-apples 
comparison with other states’ MSW recycling rates, while also enabling Maine to evaluate where 
further  efforts a re needed to improve diversion  of the broader spectrum of disposed materials 
handled by municipalities  in Maine.   
 
To determine the amount of material recycled in all years prior to this one, the State Planning 
Office and the Department utilized the annual municipal solid waste program reports submitted 
by communities, along with voluntarily reported data from commerci al processors and materials 
brokers to determine MSW recycling from the commercial sector.  However, this calculation was 
not a precise measurement as the data sets were incomplete.  Many municipal reports had 
incomplete or inaccurately -reported data, and the agencies were unable to obtain data from all 
the commercial processors and materials brokers. This calculated recycling rate also reflects only 
recorded and reported information, and does not include volumes diverted by activities such as 
backyard comp ostin g, reuse from donations and used goods sales, and other unregulated 
strategies.  
 
This year the Department engaged in a concerted effort to request recycling data from all 
commercial processors and materials brokers  known to be operating in Maine  to better 
understand  the extent of the deficiencies in reporting on recyclables .  Almost all  of the 
processors and brokers were able to  provide  the Department with the amounts by material types 
and destinations for the materials they managed.  This enabled the  Department to eliminate any 
duplicative data (created when a commodity material was handled by multiple 
processors/brokers), and to check  the data reported by municipalities in comparison to the  data 
on municipal recycling reported by the materials proces sors and brokers.   
 
The results of this effort confirmed that the reported data used to calculate Maine’s MSW 
recycling rate has been incomplete in recent years.  This is due to two factors: 1) many of 
Maine’s municipalities do not have the resources need ed to ensure complete and accurate 
reporting on municipal and commercial recycling within their borders in conformance with 38 
  
Maine Department of Environmental Protection  
9                       Maine Materials Management Plan . . .   
MRS §2133  (7); and 2) materials processors and brokers of recyclables are not required to report 
on their activities in Maine.  
 
Based on the data collected in previous years, Maine’s recycling rate has remained  fairly steady 
for th e past ten years, ranging from a low of 34.8% in 2007 to a high of 39.6% in 2011.  
However, because deficiencies have been identified in the most recent data reported by 
municipalities, the Department has calculated the 2012 recycling rate by utilizing the more 
complete data voluntarily reported by materials processors and brokers.   In addition to the 
554,225 tons reported as recycled or composted, the Department estimates the non -reporting 
processors and brokers handled up to 5 ,000 tons of recyclable materials.

C. Additional Waste Diversion  
Maine generated more than 800,000  tons of wastes other than MSW and CDD in 2012.   One 
third  of this material  was diverted from disposal to composting, agronomic utilization or 
other beneficial uses.   Examining the various types of materials  and the amoun ts utilized or 
disposed of as shown in Table 4 may provide insights into additional opportunities to increase 
diversion of some of these materials  from disposal.

Table 4 does not include all materials that could have become wastes, since many materials never 
enter the waste stream (e.g. recycled asphalt pavement).  The 2012 data for the use of these 
materials , and some shown in Table 4,  are compiled from a  variety of sources and remain under 
development (UD) at the time of this report issuance.   
 
Recent developments in conversion  technologies  that process organic  waste s to create fuels are 
creating new opportunities to significantly increase the diversion of additional solid wastes from 
disposal in Maine.   Appendix D describes these technologies and the types of materials they may 
use. 
 
 
V. Plan for State Action to Move toward Sustainable Materials  
Management  – 2014 - 2018 
 
The priorities for Maine DEP’s work on  sustainable materials management for the next 5 years  are 
to: 
 
 Encourage  the development of new infrastructure for separation from the waste stream 
and utilization  of organics , including composting and technologies such as anaerobic 
digestion . 
 
 Encourage increased  beneficial use and recycling of materials , including identification of 
incentives  and removal of unnecessary barriers.  
 
 Provide tools and assistance to municipalities and businesses to support waste reduction  
and diversion efforts .  
 
 Continue re finement of data sources and data management systems to more accurately 
and consistently assess progress toward statewide reduction and recycling goals , and to 
evaluate the effectiveness of programs and strategies .   
 
The following strategies and actions  are identified as  ways for the State to focus its resources on the 
priorities identified as achievable and likely to have the greatest impact in improving waste reduction 
and diversion  in Maine during the next five years.  
 
A. Strategies and Actions to Promote Organics Management and New Technologies  
 Provide technical and regulatory assistance to support development of regional and/or 
co-located processing facilities, including collection, sorting, composting, and biological 
and chemical conversion techn ologies.   
 Develop solid waste management regulations specific to the licensing and operation of 
conversion technologies.  
 Provide technical and regulatory assistance to s upport development of local food scrap 
composting operations, including on -farm operati ons and expansion of leaf and yard 
  
Maine Department of Environmental Protection  
12                       Maine Materials Management Plan . . .   
waste facilities to include food scraps.  Engage agricultural community to identify and 
address needs to increase participation in food scrap composting.  
 Assist food scrap generators to identify and work with facilities t hat offer alternatives to 
disposal, such as compost facilities and anaerobic digesters.  
 Develop outreach and education strategy to assist food scrap generators with separation 
programs.  
 Develop case studies of successful organics separation and management operations, 
highlighting strategies for addressing potential issues such as odors, staff training, and 
additional resource needs.  
  
 
B. Strategies and Actions to Increase Beneficial Use and Recycling  
 Update recycling promotional campaign materials, develop additional materials for other 
diversion strategies, and maintain online.  
 Coordinate with other Northeast States to develop regional approaches to support the 
development of recycling options for discarded mattresses and carpet.  
 Identify and remove unneces sary barriers to the use of CDD wood as fuel , including 
review of waste characterization protocols . 
 Explore opportunities to provide incentives for the use of municipally -generated C DD 
wood as biomass fuel.   
 Update non -hazardous waste transporter regulati ons to reduce/remove requirements 
that no longer significantly improve environmental outcomes.  
 Evaluate collection strategies  for single -use (primary) batteries, antifreeze, and small gas 
cylinders , or other difficult to dispose of products .   
 
 
C. Strategies  and Actions to Support Municipalities and Businesses  
 Develop and distribute waste diversion  measurement tool for municipalities.  
 Identify measurement tools for municipal and business entities to evaluate  the 
environmental impacts of materials  management systems, including greenhouse gas 
emissions . 
 Continue program activities related to education, collection and proper disposal of 
unwanted pharmaceuticals and medical sharps  
 Provide a ssistance to  municipalities and businesses to improve  collection and recycling 
of electronic wastes, mercury containing products, and architectural paint.  
 Update and distribute  building deconstruction guidance.  
 Provide for positive public recognition of entities including municipalities, regions, and 
busines ses that have made changes in their processes and  systems that result in 
significant diversion of materials from disposal.

D. Strategies and Actions to Provide Reliable Data to Support Sustainable Materials 
Management  
 
 Collect , utilize  and disseminate r eliable data to calculate statewide recycling and diversion 
rates for MSW and other solid wastes : 
o Develop and implement standardized data collection and management procedures  
and requirements  for reporting of marketed recyclables by materials processors an d 
brokers . 
o Develop and publish annual waste generation , diversion  and disposal rates for 
industrial wastes .  
o Continue to d evelop and publish annual waste generation rates for MSW, including 
CDD . 
 Assist municipalities in tracking of municipal recycling rate s by developing and distributing a 
model methodology to calculate municipal generation, diversion and disposal rates for MSW.  
 Collect , utilize and disseminate  reliable data on annual waste diversion through beneficial 
use, agronomic utilization, anaerobic digestion, and waste conversion  practices .  
 
 
VI. Conclusion  
 
Many  opportunities remain in Maine to further divert materials from disposal .  Organic materials 
such as food scraps can be separated from the waste stream and composted or processed by 
conversion technologies such as anaerobic digesters.  Other types of conversion technologies can 
process a variety of materials to produce synthetic gas or liquid fuel.  Additionally, improvements in 
data quality can assist the Department, municipalities  and regions to better evaluate the performance 
and effectiveness of waste management and diversion programs in Maine.   
 
The Department has identified  a number of strategies to increase diversion rates, reduce disposal 
volumes, and to further utilize materials in Maine.  The Department will evaluate and implement 
programs to encourage food scrap separation by industrial, commercial and institutional ent ities.  
The Department will also revise its regulations to clarify and specify licensing requirements for 
facilities utilizing conversion technologies.  The Department recommends that facilities currently 
producing large volumes of or managing waste materi als explore opportunities to establish co -
located conversion technologies to achieve the greatest efficiencies through fuel generation and 
minimization o f transportation costs.  
 
These strategies can provide domestic, renewable energy sources, contribute t o local economies, 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and extend the lifespan of Maine’s existing landfill capacity.

16 Beneficial use of waste  (38 MRS §2132 (3)).  The use of waste paper, waste plastics, waste wood, 
including wood from demolition debris, used motor vehicle tires or corrugated cardboard as a fuel in 
industrial boilers or waste -to-energy facilities for the generation of heat, steam or electricity 
constitutes recycling only for the purposes of determining whether the goals in subsection 1 are met 
and for determining municipal progress as provided in section 2133. In order for the use of waste 
under this subsection to constitute recycling, the department must determine that there is n o 
reasonably available market in the State for recycling that waste and the wastes must be incinerated 
as a substitute for, or supplement to, fossil or biomass fuels incinerated in the industrial boiler or 
waste -to-energy facility.  
 
Municipal solid waste  (06-096 CMR  400 (NNNN )).  "Municipal solid waste" means solid waste 
emanating from household and normal commercial sources. Municipal solid waste includes front 
end process residue from the processing of municipal solid waste.  
 
Recycle  (38 MRS §1302 -C (21)).  "Recycle" means to recover, separate, collect and reprocess waste 
materials for sale or reuse other than use as a fuel for the generation of heat, steam or electricity.  
 
Recycling  (38 MRS §1302 -C (22)).  Recycling. “Recycling" means the collection, separation, 
recovery and sale or reuse of materials that would otherwise be disposed of or processed as waste or 
the mechanized separation of waste, other than through combustion, and the creation and recovery 
of reusable materials ot her than as a fuel for the generation of electricity.  
 
Solid waste  (38 MRS §1302-C (29)).  "Solid waste" means useless, unwanted or discarded solid 
material with insufficient liquid content to be free -flowing, including, but not lim ited to, rubbish, 
garbage, refuse -derived fuel, scrap materials, junk, refuse, inert fill material and landscape refuse, but 
does not include hazardous waste, biomedical waste, septage or agricultural wastes. The fact that a 
solid waste or constituent of t he waste may have value or other use or may be sold or exchanged 
does not exclude it from this definition.    
 
Solid waste facility  (38 MRS §1303 -C (31)). "Solid waste facility" means a waste facility used for the 
handling of solid waste, except that the following facilities are not included:  
A. A waste facility that employs controlled combustion to dispose of waste generated exclusively 
by an institution al, commercial or industrial establishment that owns the facility;  
B. Lime kilns; wood chip, bark and hogged fuel boilers; kraft recovery boilers and sulfite process 
recovery boilers, which combust solid waste generated exclusively at the facility; and [  
C. An industrial boiler that combusts mixed paper, corrugated cardboard or office paper to 
generate heat, steam or electricity if:  
(1) The mixed paper, corrugated cardboard or office paper would otherwise be placed in a 
landfill;

 Appendix D - Waste  Conversion Technologies  
22 There are three broad categories of waste conversion technologies: 1) thermochemical, such as 
gasification, pyrolysis, and plasma arc technology; 2) physiochemical, such as distillation of ethanol 
and the production of biodiesel; and 3) biochemical, such as an aerobic digestion and ethanol 
fermenta tion and hydrolysis. Potential benefits  of these technologies include  lower greenhouse gas 
and other  air emissions, renewable energy  production , offset of fossil fuels, and beneficial use of 
waste  materials . 
 
Four  technologies are briefly discussed here because they are new and have relevance for Maine and 
large-scale applications for waste management.  
 
1.  Gasification  
 
Gasification is a term that describes a chemical process by which carbonaceous (hydrocarbon) 
materials (coal, petroleum coke, biomass, etc.) are converted to a synthesis gas (syngas) by means of 
partial oxidation with air, oxygen, and/or steam . 
 
A hydrocarbon feedstock is fed into a high -pressure, high -temperature chemical reactor (gasifier) 
conta ining steam and a limited amount of oxygen. Under these “reducing” conditions, the chemical 
bonds in the feedstock are severed by the extreme heat and pressure and a syngas is formed. This 
syngas is primarily a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The syngas is then cleansed using 
systems that remove particulates, sulfur, and trace metals.  The resulting gas mixture is a fuel.  
Gasification is potentially a very efficient method for extracting energy  from many different types of 
carbon -containing  materials.  More of the energy contained in the materials is extracted by 
gasification than direct combustion of the original fuel,  such as occurs in the  current waste -to-energy  
technologies  employed in Maine.  In addition, the high -temperature process refines out corrosive 
ash elements allowing cleaner gas production from otherwise problematic fuels, and produces lower 
emissions of greenhouse gases than waste -to-energy  systems.  
2.  Plasma Arc Technology  
 
Plasma arc gasification as a waste treatment technology uses high electrical energy and high 
temperature created by an electrical arc gasifier to break down the waste primarily into elemental gas 
and a solid waste slag. The process is intended to be a net generator of electricity, depending upon 
the composition of wastes, and also to reduce the volumes of waste being sent to landfill sites.  
 
A different type of plasma arc waste conversion that uses plasma to refine gases produced during 
waste c onversion, rather than to destroy waste, has recently been shown to be successful on a full 
commercial test scale in Ontario.  Its emissions are lower than other thermal waste processing 
systems, and by converting waste to CO2 and water, rather than to met hane, the greenhouse gas 
emissions  are much less  than those from competing technologies.  
 
There are a number of large scale plasma projects proposed to come on line over the next several 
years including proposals in Ottawa, Ontario, St. Lucie County, Flori da and the City of Tallahassee , 
Florida.  
 
 Appendix D - Waste  Conversion Technologies  
23 3. Biochemical – Anaerobic digestion  
Anaerobic digestion is a process where microorganisms break down organic materials, such as 
manure, sewage sludge and food scraps, in the absence of oxygen.  This decompositio n process 
produces biogas, made primarily of methane and carbon dioxide, which is captured and combusted 
to produce electrical energy and heat.  The digestion process also produces a liquid digestate that can 
be used as a soil amendment, and a solid digest ate that can be utilized as a bedding material for 
livestock, composted or applied to crop land to enrich the soil.  
Anaerobic digesters may utilize animal manure or sewage sludge as its primarily organic feedstock, 
with food scraps added as another organic  feedstock, or food can be digested at facilities specifically 
designed for the organic portion of municipal solid waste.  Co -digestion is a process whereby 
additional, energy -rich organic materials (e.g. food scraps or fats, oils, and grease) are added to  dairy 
or wastewater digesters that have excess processing capacity.  
There are currently several anaerobic digesters in operation in Maine, using either animal manures or 
sewage sludge as the primary organic material, with other facilities in planning or d iscussion phase.  
4.  Landfill Gas  
 
Landfills can be  actively manage d for their gas recovery potential.  The gas can be  used to fuel 
generators to produce electricity , piped to other fuel combustion facilities, or compressed and 
bottled .  The gas is collected by placing pipes in the landfill , and maintaining  slight pressure 
sufficient to draw the gas into a recovery plant but not enough to draw oxygen in through the 
landfill cap.   The gas is then cleaned and either piped  to a generator plan t, a local application , or a 
compressor plant .   
 
There are currently two landfills in Maine capturing landfill gas and combusting it in on -site facilities 
to generate electrical power for the  grid: the closed former Pine Tree Landfill in Hampden (owned 
by Casella  Waste Services) and the currently active Crossroads Landfill in Norridgewock (owned by 
Waste Management Inc.)  The state owned landfill in Old Town, Juniper Ridge, is currently flaring 
its landfill gas, but discussions are underway to beneficially capture and utilize that gas through an 
agreement with the University of Maine at Orono.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s October 2012 r eport, “State of Practice for Emerging 
Waste Conversion Technologies” ( http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100FBUS.pdf )  
While the application of these technologies to municipal solid waste (MSW) feed stocks is only emerging in the United 
States (U.S.), these technologies have been applied for the management of MSW in other parts of the world, such as 
Australia, Canada, Europe, and Japan. A key aspect of international applications is that they are part of waste 
systems with advanced segregation, such as source segregated organics collection. Where conversion technologies have been 
most successful is in locations with already established programs for waste segregation and collection, dedicated waste 
streams (e.g., plastic from industrial partners), and waste supply contracts so that potential plants can operate 
economically.

 Appendix F - Municipal Solid Waste Management Costs  
 
28 Components of a municipal solid waste (MSW) management system include collection, 
transportation, facility operations, marketing of recyclables, and final disposal.  38 MRS A §1305 
states that each municipality in Maine is responsible for providing for “solid waste disposal services 
for domestic and commercial solid waste generated within the municipality .” This allows each 
municipality local control to determine the managemen t system it will use to fulfill this 
responsibility, including how much of the system will be publically or privately owned and/or 
operated, and how the system  is funded.   
 
The overall cost of MSW management for a municipality and its residents is determi ned by the 
amount generated and disposed, the disposal fee, operational and transportation costs, and the cost 
of or revenue from recycled materials.   
 
Collection  
 
Options for collecting MSW from residences for transport to either a transfer station or d isposal 
facility include: drop off (self -haul by residents), curbside collection by private  haulers contracted by 
individual households , curbside collection by a private hauler(s) contracted by the municipal ity, and 
municipally -provided curbside collection .  The latter two options result in much more efficient 
collection than the first two, which involve multiple vehicles engaged in overlapping trips with less 
waste transported for each mil e travelled.    
 
Municipalities that contract for or provide curbside  collection can set operational requirements to 
realize the overall cost savings achieved by such efficiencies.  Taking responsibility for collection of 
MSW from households also enables municipalities to transition to management strategies proven to 
decrea se disposal rates and increase recycling and composting of organics.  Such strategies include 
pay-as-you-throw for disposal, and more frequent collection of compostable organics and 
recyclables and less frequent collection of trash for disposal.  Along wit h savings realized through 
transportation efficiencies, additional reductions in waste management costs can be realized where 
disposal tipping fees are greater than fees for the management of recyclables and compostable 
organics.      
 
Transportation  
Transportation costs can be consistently expressed as the dollar amount per ton per mile.  As part of 
a recent regional solid waste management plan ning initiative, the MidCoast Economic Development 
District (MCEDD) determined that MSW transportation costs for 11 different facilities ranged from 
$2.36/ton/mile to $5.46/ton/mile, with smaller facilities having relatively higher costs.  
 
Disposal  
 
The management system costs determined by the  final disposal location include disposal (tipping) 
fees and transportation costs .  
 
Facilities offering in-state disposal  and recent disposal fees include:

Tipping fees change over time and may be dependent on the waste volume, type and whether the 
waste is residential or commercial.   Towns that are on or near the state borders may want to 
consider disposal facilities outside t he state.  Out of state disposal facilities that are used by some 
Maine towns include : Cogerno Landfill, Rivière -Verte, NB ; Southwest Landfill , Lawrence Station, 
NB; Mt. Carberry , Success, NH ; and Waste Management ’s Turnkey Landfill , Rochester, NH .  
   
Recycling  
 
Recycling programs vary by municipality but contain similar components: separation, collection, 
processing and marketing.  The generator of municipal solid waste makes a conscious decision to 
separate from their trash those materials and product s that are accepted by the local recycling 
program. Once separated from the trash, the recyclables are provided to the recycling program, and 
that is where a significant difference can exist.  For communities with curbside collection, many have 
switched fr om a program where residents placed separated recyclables at the curb to a ‘single stream’ 
program where all recyclables are placed curbside in a single container, a more efficient collection 
system, reducing collection costs and encouraging increased part icipation in the recycling program.  
These co -mingled recyclables are then transported to a materials recovery facility (MRF) where 
sorting of the recyclables occurs, and then the recyclables are processed and marketed.  Many other 
communities still collec t separated recyclables at the curb or accept them at their drop -off recycling 
center where the materials are processed and marketed.  
 
The single -stream recycling programs greatly reduce the collection costs of recyclables but require 
capital intensive sor ting systems.  The costs for curbside collection are typically absorbed by the 
municipality, which then is responsible for delivering the recyclables to a MRF that it either is a part 
owner of or contracts for its use.  Costs at a MRF are typically covered  by the value of recyclables, 
but there is often a recyclable’s value point achieved where a municipality may receive a portion of 
the value in return, or should the recyclable’s value point decrease, the municipality may have to pay 
a fee for the processi ng and marketing of its recyclables.  Actual MRF expenses vary by facility, but 
operationally, costs per ton of recyclable received and processed ranges from $55 to $75 per ton for 
the single stream recyclables, with that cost being covered by the value re ceived from the sale of the 
products.   
 
In a program where residents drop off their separated recyclables, recycling center staff process and 
market the recyclables.  Little sorting of recyclables is necessary.  The costs are primarily labor and 
equipment  but the recycling program receives the value of the recyclables it processes.  The costs for 
these programs vary as well, and may range from $40 to $90 per ton, or higher, depending upon the 
 Appendix F - Municipal Solid Waste Management Costs  
 
30 size of the operation, the types and amounts of recyclables acce pted, and equipment used for 
processing.  The values  received for recyclables vary [ see excerpt from  the Maine Resource Recovery 
Association (MMR)  monthly markets report below ], but in many cases reduce the net cost of 
managing the recycling program down t owards zero. The differences here are that the collection 
costs are borne by the resident and the value of the recyclables is received by the municipality.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When comparing recycling options and value against the costs  of disposal, communities may identify 
the tipping fee charged and not include the collection, consolidation and/or hauling fees in its 
disposal costs.  Recycling programs are typically more closely monitored for costs, from collection to 
separati on to processing, but the value of recyclables may be not included since that income often 
goes into the municipality’s general fund, and not towards the recycling program.  
 
Composting  
Many Maine families utilize a back yard composting system for their org anics, which  may include 
leaf and yard trimmings as well as kitchen scraps.  This type of system keeps organics out of the 
waste stream and creates a beneficial product for home use.  Backyard composting is a very efficient 
way to manage organics and reduc e dependency upon disposal options.

31 Over eighty municipalities provide a leaf and yard trimmings compost facility for their residents to 
utilize, as part of a larger program to reduce the amount of materials being discarded and at the same 
time generate a  product that can be used by residents and the municipality.  Leaf and yard trimmings 
programs are a low operational/maintenance program that can easily divert ten percent or more of 
the community’s waste stream from disposal at a fairly low cost.  Compost ing pads may be 
constructed of gravel , and the compost piles only need to be turned four times a year .  Most 
programs turn the piles more frequently, which can result in more rapid decomposition of the 
materials and a better product.  These types of compos ting programs can operate for $25 to $40 per 
ton and are often welcomed by residents.  Most programs do not charge for the finished compost or 
may charge a nominal fee to assist with the program’s costs. These programs support  the diversion 
of waste while keeping the value of the compost product local.  
 
Some municipal composting programs are beginning to accept food scraps from residents, 
institutions and businesses, which will further reduce the amount of organic residuals sent off for 
disposal.  Compostin g operations utilizing food scraps require more attention , which may increase 
facility management costs,  but can produce  a higher quality compost  for community  participants .  
One of the challenges with accepting food scraps is the logistics of delivery of the food scraps from 
generator s to the composting facility.  
 
Since issuance of the previous State plan, several anaerobic digesters that process food scraps 
commenced operation in Maine.  While the primary organic utilized in these digesters is manure, 
adding food scraps can have a positive effect on  the unit’s  operation.  There are logistic al challenges 
with identif ying food scrap generators and securing a hauler for delivering those scraps to the 
anaerobic digester, where they can be mixed with the manure  to generate methane gas, which is then 
combusted to produce electricity.  
 
 Appendix G - Consolidation of ownership in the disposal, collection, recycling & hauling of 
solid waste  
32 The Waste Generation and Disposal Capacity Report, for even -numbered years, is to include an 
analysis of consolidati on in the ownership of the collection, recycling, hauling, and disposal sectors.  
This is performed to review Maine’s solid waste industry for possible undue consolidation and the 
potential for unfavorable impacts on competition. The Department examines th ese industry sections 
to look for conditions that may either create a decrease in services or a monopolistic situation.  
 
For 2012, Maine’s solid waste industry was a mix of public and private investments and services that 
handled nearly 5,000 tons of materials each day.  A review  of that system and its components  shows 
that the interrelated services of collection and hauling  of recyclables and trash, and the processing or 
disposal of those materials, were provided in a consistent fashion, responding to Maine’s solid waste 
management needs.  
 
Disposal Facilities  
 
During 2012, there was one change in the ownership/operation of a disposal facility, the Maine 
Energy Recovery Company (MERC), a waste -to-energy ( WTE ) incinerator .  Located in Biddeford, 
MERC ceased operation the end of December under an agreement with the City of Biddeford.   
Subsequent to  the previous review of conso lidation in the waste management industry provided in 
the 2012 report , the Town of Greenville closed its landfill in 2011.   
 
Collection and Hauling Services  
 
During 2012, no substantial change in the ownership or operation of the many collection and 
hauling companies servicing residents, businesses, and municipalities was identified.  There has been  
an increase in the ‘partnering’ or ‘sharing of equipment/servi ces’ within the hauling sector, where 
one company contract s with another to provide collection, hauling or equipment services in th e 
hiring company’s stead.  While these arrangements are typical, it will be an activity that the 
Department will monitor in t he coming years, from the perspective of a potential shift in market 
share.  
 
Recycling Services  
 
In 2012, both processors and haulers continued promoting their offerings of the ‘single stream’ 
recycling collection strategy, also known as ‘single sort’ or ‘Zero Sort®’ services, where residents are 
able to place all of their recyclables into a single container for collection.  This single container is 
then collected, delivered to a processing facility, and the material sorted into commodities  and 
market ed.  Ecomaine , a non -profit waste management company owned and operated by 21 
municipalities in Southern Maine, established a single sort recycling program in 2007.  FCR 
Goodman and Pine Tree Waste, divisions of Casella Waste Systems, Inc. offer a single stream  
recycling collection service through their program known as Zero Sort®.  The collected recyclables 
are consolidated and shipped to either of the company’s two processing facilities in Auburn, 
Massachusetts and Charleston, Massachusetts.  As of this date, Casella is planning on constructing a 
recyclables processing facility in Lewiston .
