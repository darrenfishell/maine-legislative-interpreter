Cultural Affairs Committee: 
LD 1472, Resolve, Directing the Department of Education and the Maine Municipal Bond Bank 
to Amend Their Rules Regarding the Maine School Facilities Finance Program and the School 
Revolving Renovation Fund, directs the Department of Education and the Maine Municipal 
Bond Bank to amend their rules to increase the maximum total loan for repair, renovation, and 
improvement projects for Priority 1-5 projects from $4 million to $8 million. 
It is important to note that with a higher cap, the Department of Education projects that fewer 
projects will be funded unless additional monies are transferred into the fund. Potentially some 
school administrative units will beneﬁt by the larger loans, however, others will be 
disadvantaged by not receiving any loan. 
The Department will be available to provide additional information on LD 1472 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work session. 
Sincerely,
