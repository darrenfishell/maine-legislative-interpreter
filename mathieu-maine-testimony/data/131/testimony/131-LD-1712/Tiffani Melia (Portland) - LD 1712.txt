Good
afternoon
Representative
Roeder
and
Senator
Baldacci,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services
Committee;
my
name
is
T if fani
Melia
and
I
live
in
Portland,
Maine.
I
am
a
former
youth
in
care
and
a
long
time
member
of
Maine’ s
Y outh
Leadership
Advisory
T eam,
which
is
a
place
where
young
people
in
foster
care
get
together
to
create
change
in
the
child
welfare
system.
I
entered
foster
care
at
age
15,
and
got
my
learners
permit
shortly
after
in
my
junior
year
of
high
school.
However ,
I
had
to
renew
my
learners
permit
not
once
but
two
times;
and
I
was
not
able
to
get
my
driving
hours
required
to
get
my
license
because
my
foster
parents
were
not
able
to
help
me
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
I
found
myself
having
to
rely
on
public
transportation
and
rides
from
friends
after
I
turned
18
because
I
wasn’ t
able
to
get
my
driving
hours.
When
I
went
to
college
at
the
University
of
Maine
at
Farmington,
I
was
far
away
from
my
friends/family ,
missed
important
medical
appointments,
and
was
not
able
to
get
to
the
grocery
store
when
I
needed
to.
I
also
could
not
get
a
job
far
away
from
campus
because
I
did
not
have
a
way
to
get
to
and
from.
This
was
very
isolating
and
frustrating.
I
did
not
receive
my
drivers
license
until
the
age
of
21.
I
believe
strongly
that
this
bill,
LD
1712
would
change
a
lot
of
young
people’ s
lives
by
lessening
the
burden
of
not
having
financial
or
familial
support
to
obtain
their
license.
I
have
had
my
license
for
almost
5
years
now ,
and
I
have
graduated
from
college
with
a
bachelor ’ s
degree.
I
am
proud
of
myself
for
overcoming
adversity ,
and
I
hope
that
this
bill
can
help
all
youth
in
care
reach
their
goals.
Thank
you
all
for
your
time
and
dedication
to
supporting
youth
in
care
who
are
moving
forward
to
adulthood.
Sincerely ,
T if fani
Melia
