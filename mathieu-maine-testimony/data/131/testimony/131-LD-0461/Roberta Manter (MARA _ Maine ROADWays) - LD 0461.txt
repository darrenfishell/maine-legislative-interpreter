Members of  the State and L ocal Gove rnment Committ ee,
I am writing  not to give y ou more mate rial to rea d, but in the hope of making  materia ls you have
already been a sked to consider  easie r to find, and ther eby saving  you some time.
Conflicting de finitions of the term “pr ivate wa y”:
23 MRS §3021 - 2.  P ublic ease ment.  "Public ea sement"  means a n ease ment held by  a
municipality  for pur poses of public a ccess to land or wate r not otherwise  connec ted to a public
way, and includes a ll rights enjoy ed by  the public with respe ct to private w ays created by  statute
prior to J uly 29, 1976. Private wa ys created pur suant to former  sections 3001 and 3004 pr ior to
July 29, 1976 are  public ease ments.

23 MRS §1903 - 10-A.  Private wa y.  "Priva te way " means a pr ivate roa d, drivewa y or public
easement as def ined in section 3021.

17-A MRS §505. Obstructing  public way s
1.  A per son is guilty  of obstructing  public way s if he unre asonably  obstructs the fr ee pa ssage of
foot or vehic ular tra ffic on a ny public way , and re fuses to ce ase or  remove  the obstruction upon a

[PL 1975, c. 499, §1 (N EW).]
2.  As used in this section, "public w ay" means a w ay, including a  sidewalk, owne d and
maintained by  the State, a c ounty  or a municipa lity over w hich the g eneral public has a  right to

Town of F ayette v Mante r, 528 A.2d 887
https:/ /law.justia.com/case s/maine/supreme- court/1987/528-a- 2d-887-0.html
Footnote 1 -  “[1] The phra se "private w ay subject to g ates a nd bars"  meant in 1945 that the Town
retained, in eff ect, a  public ease ment in the road. See  Browne v. Connor, 138 Me . 63, 67-68, 21
A.2d 709, 710 (1941). T he ter m "public e aseme nt" is now de fined in 23 M.R.S.A. § 3021(2)
(1980). The  parties a gree that a " private w ay subject to g ates a nd bars"  is the leg al equivale nt of a
"public e aseme nt" as defined in se ction 3021(2). The  parties a lso ag ree that when a  town
discontinues a roa d and re tains a " public ease ment," the  public has an unf ettere d right of ac cess
over tha t road but the town ha s no maintenanc e responsibili ty. The pa rties disag ree over w hether
this definition of a public ea sement is constitutional. The Manters a rgue that a town should be
permitted to reta in a public ea sement in a roa d only  if the town maintains it or fully  reimburse s
private individuals as c osts are inc urred by those individuals in maintaining the roa d.
Summary : 
23 MRS §3021 s ays private wa ys are for public acce ss.
29-A §MRS 101 (58) say s the owner  of a pr ivate wa y may re strict use or passage , even if  it’s a
public ease ment.
23 MRS §1903 s ays a private  way is either one of the a bove.
29-A MRS 101 (59) spec ifies that only  way s maintained  by the public ar e conside red public
ways.
17-A MRS §505 (2) say s that “public way” includes not only  way s that are  maintained by  the
public, but also way s upon which the public ha s acc ess as invitees or  licensee s.
Town of F ayette v Mante r say s the public has an unfettered right of acce ss over a  private w ay.
Examples of the r esult of these c ontradictory  definitions:
Example 1:
Background: A 1945 County  Commi ssioners’ orde r said the Young  Road in Fa yette wa s a
“priva te way  subject to g ates a nd bars.”   This order w as not made “ pursuant to forme r sections
3001 and 3004 prior to July  29, 1976,” as pe r the de finition in §3021.  (Those sections did not
exist in 1945, and they  grante d towns, not counties, the power  to lay  out or discontinue private
ways.)  B ased on those two f acts a nd on 29-A §MRS 101, parag raphs 58 a nd 59, David Mante r
conclude d that Young  Road is not a public way , and that he ha d a rig ht to restrict use or  passag e. 
He posted the  road “ no trespassing ” in an a ttempt to prevent y et another  logg ing ope ration fr om
using the  south end of the r oad, as he  had alr eady had to re build it after ea ch of se veral previous
logging ope rations.  B ut based on the de finitions in 23 M RS §3021 and 17-A MRS §505 (2), he
was a rrested, found g uilty, and sente nced to 10* da ys in jail: 
State of Maine v Ma nter   https://caselaw .findlaw.c om/me-supreme -judicial-c ourt/1061320.html 
“...the Super ior Court (Kenne bec County , Marde n, J.) issued an or der pe rmane ntly enjoining
Manter f rom ‘taking  any action which inter feres in any  way  with the public' s use of the Y oung
Road.’ De spite this inj unction, Manter pla ced a  no trespassing  sign in the middle of the  road.  
He wa s promptly  arrested for  obstructing  a public wa y and wa s then rele ased on ba il with the
condition that he re move the sig n and obstruct Young  Road no furthe r.   Sever al months later,
Jody Pease w as attempting  to use Young  Road when Ma nter pre vented him from doing  so by
standing  in the road a nd ref using to move.”
“...the testimony  supports the finding  that Manter obstruc ted Young  Road.
The e ntry is:
Judgment aff irmed.”
Question: Whi ch def initions  apply ?  If Young  Road is a discontinued roa d that was de signa ted a
“priva te way ” by the county  in 1945, and if it is not maintained by  the public, is it a public way
or isn’t it?
