Hank Margolis
Woods Lake Association, Bridgton
LD 461
I am the President of a statutory road association in Bridgton, Maine called the Woods
Lake Association.
As is the case with many such associations in Maine, most of our members pay their 
dues on time and we are able to maintain our roads and keep phosphorus from 
entering nearby water bodies through investments in erosion control.
When a small number of property owners do not pay their dues, it creates undue effort
on our volunteer elected officers to try and collect. Like many such associations, we 
have a small number of property owners who do not pay. The opportunity for liens 
has been very beneficial. 
However, the time frame for liens was shortened to 18 months a few years ago. This 
makes it almost impossible for road associations like ours to collect unpaid dues. 
Expanding the timeframe from 18 months to six years would have a large impact on 
small associations like ours. Filing fees alone for these liens have put a strain on our 
budget and detracted from our mission of providing safe roads and reducing erosion.
Please pass LD 461 on behalf of the many private road associations like ours in 
Maine.
