B. a reserve account or accounts to be created to hold funds to be used for future 
maintenance expenses that are anticipated to exceed the amount that would be appropriate 
to assess in a single year,
and may raise money for that either or both of those purposes pursuant to section 3101, 
subsection 5.
Testimony: This is essential for projects requiring more than the routine expense of minimal 
road maintenance. It allows funds to be built up over time to accomplish expensive projects 
that cannot be completed in a year or broken down into smaller steps to be accomplished 
each year.
Raising annual assessments or imposing special assessments would not be necessary. This 
would relieve those on fixed or limited incomes from the burden of sudden large increases to 
their expenses. In addition, this reserve account would allow time to plan the project or a 
means to address emergency road repairs like failed culverts or severe washouts.

Testimony: I support the elimination of the18 month extension period of a duly recorded 
notice of claim.
Most road association board members are volunteers. This 18 month extension places an 
unreasonable and unnecessary burden on these volunteers to track when extensions are 
due. Elimination of this 18 month period simplifies the process. Liens can be recorded and 
discharged when appropriate. No unnecessary extensions would need to be recorded. This 
also benefits the property owner since they can pay to discharge each lien as their budget 
permits
