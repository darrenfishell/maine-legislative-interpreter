Steve  Freeman
Fellows Farm Road Association
LD 461
My name is Steve Freeman, I am, and have been for 11 years, president of Fellows 
Farm Road Association in Fayette, Maine. I am testifying in Favor of LD 461.
Many of the issues being addressed in LD 461 will improve and enhance the 
operation of our Private Road association. 
Significant, is the change in filing extensions on Notices of Non-payment which will 
preserve funds we desperately need to maintain our road. In addition the proposed 
change from filing an extension at 18 months to 6 years will significantly lessen the 
burden and number of hours to perform this function. 
Of note our association is run solely by volunteers.
Thank you for your time and attention.
