Testimony of Trevor Putnoky 
to the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
In Opposition to 
LD 1220, An Act to Require Lyme Disease Vaccine Coverage for State-regulated Health Plans 
May 8, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services. 
My name is Trevor Putnoky and I'm the Director of Membership and Communications at the Healthcare 
Purchaser Alliance of Maine. The HPA is a nonprofit that represents the purchasers of healthcare in Maine. 
Our mission is to advance healthcare value and to support and incentivize high—quality, affordable care. We 
have over 60 members, including some of the largest public and private employers and health trusts in 
Maine. Collectively, our members spend over a billion dollars annually providing health care for nearly one 
quarter of the commercially insured population in the state. 
l’m here today to testify in opposition to LD 1220, as we believe it is premature to create a Lyme disease 
vaccine mandate. While there are many promising vaccine candidates in the pipeline, including options 
from Moderna and Pfizer, none has applied for Food and Drug Administration approval. An analysis of the 
vaccine pipeline released last month predicted that Pfizer's vaccine is likely to be the first to reach the 
market,‘ but the company has said it is aiming to potentially apply for FDA authorization in 2025.2 
Until one or more of these vaccines goes through the FDA approval process, we will be missing important 
information about any vaccine’s potential efficacy, side effects, cost, and target population —al| of which 
will be critical data for the committee to have as it evaluates whether to mandate coverage, and whata 
mandated coverage program would look like. Such information will also be necessary for a meaningful 
Bureau of Insurance mandate review.

We share the sponsor's hope that a safe and effective vaccine will soon be available to protect people from 
Lyme disease, particularly in lvlaine, which has the highest incidence of Lyme disease in the C0Uf\tl‘\/.3 But 
until a vaccine is actually available, we believe it is premature to consider mandated coverage, and 
therefore urge the committee to vote ought not to pass on LD 1220. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide HPA's feedback. I'd be happy to answer any questions and will be 
available for the work session.
