Testimony in Support of:  
LD 1220, An Act to Require Lyme Disease Vaccine Coverage for State Regulated Health Plans  
May 8, 2023  
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee On Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services, thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments in 
support of LD 1220, An Act to Require Lyme Disease Vaccine Co verage for State Regulated Health 
Plans.  
My name is Ceilidh Shea  and I am the Policy Advocate  at Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a 
nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates the right to quality, affordable health care for every 
person in Maine. As designated by Maine ’s Attorney General, CAHC serves as Maine’s Health Insurance 
Consumer Assistance Program (CAP) , which operates a toll -free HelpLine. Our HelpLine fields 
approximately 6,000 calls and emails every year from people across Maine who need help obtaining, 
keepi ng, using, or fixing problems with private health insurance or with accessing or affording health care 
services. CAHC also serves as the Ombudsman program for Maine’s Medicaid program, MaineCare, and 
helps people apply for and navigate the enrollment proce ss for MaineCare. It is with that background that 
we provide these comments.  
LD 122 0 require s carriers to provide coverage for vaccines for Lyme disease authorized by the federal 
Food and Drug Administration  without cost-sharing . Although a Lyme vaccine is not currently available , 
there  is a vaccine for Lyme that is in its final clinical trial and could be come available as soon as 2025. 
There was once access to a Lyme vaccine, LYMERix, but it was withdrawn from the market 20 years 
ago. The vaccine had fai rly high efficacy, but some users blamed it for adverse reactions, including 
arthritis. As the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases notes, "analysis by the FDA and 
others did not support that conclusion" — but use of the vaccine plummeted,  leading to it being 
discontinued.1 The new vaccine works in a way that's similar to LYMERix, targeting an outer surface 
protein of the Borrelia bacteria that cause Lyme disease. But VLA15 , the new vaccine,  omits a protein 
region "that some had attributed to adverse events," according to the NIAID.2  
Lyme disease is the second most commonly reported infectious disease in Maine.3 Thro ugh ou r HelpLine, 
we’ve heard from consumers about the ways their lives have been drastically altered by Lyme. Many 
have devastating and debilitating medical issues develop as a result of their infection. Arthritis , muscle 
weakness, chronic fatigue, headache, and fever are all common symptom s that vary in severity depending 
on the patient.4 According to FAIR healt h, Maine is the state with the third most private insurance claims

related to Lyme disease – a statistic that also increased in 2021 within the state, suggesting an increase in 
incidence of the in fection.5 The need for a vaccine to protect against Lyme is  needed.  
The prevalence of ticks, and therefore the risk of contracting Lyme, are heightened by changes to Maine’s 
climate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says  ticks used  to be confined to warmer climates. 
However, milder winters and longer, hotter summers have allow ed deer ticks that carry Lyme to move 
into new areas of Maine that were previously too cold. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says 
climate change may b e playing a role in the rise of cases in areas of the U.S., including the Northeast part 
of the country.6 As tick  populations continue to becom e more prevalent  across our state,  it is vital that 
Mainers who want to , have access to a vaccine as soon as one is available.   
It is also important to emphasize the burden on the health care system that is caused by Lyme . Lyme costs 
the U.S. health care system between $712 million and $1.3 billion every year —an average of about 
$3,000 per patient —in testin g costs and repeat doctor visits. In the analysis, people with Lyme disease 
had 87% more doctors’ visits and 71% more visits to the emergency room in the year after their diagnosis 
compared to demographically similar people who didn’t have Lyme.7 A vaccin e could offset many of 
these costs  and could help prevent health issues related to Lyme,  by deterring infection to begin with. For 
all of these reasons that I urge you to support LD 1 220. Thank you and I’d be happy to answer any 
questions.
