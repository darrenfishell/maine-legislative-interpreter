Testimony of Dan Demeritt 5/8/23 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
In Opposition to LD 1220 
An Act to Require Lyme Disease Vaccine Coverage for State Regulated Health Plans 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Demeritt, the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, 
Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and United Health Care. Our private 
and non~proﬁt insurance carriers provide or administer health insurance coverage to about 
600,000 Maine people. Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people 
by promoting affordable, safe, and coordinated healthcare. 
Unfortunately, there are currently no vaccines approved for use in the United States to aid in 
preventing Lyme disease in people.1 
Progress is being made, but those vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials. While there 
are hopes of an application for FDA authorization as early as 2025, setbacks were disclosed in 
February with Pﬁzer’s Phase 3 clinical study.2 
We do not know if a Lyme Disease vaccine will be approved, when that might occur, how much 
it will cost, or how effective it might be. Given all those unknowns, it is premature to mandate 
coverage of a vaccine that does not yet exist. 
As a result, we urge a vote of ought not to pass.
