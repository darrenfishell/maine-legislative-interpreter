LD 526 An Act to Provide Funding to Emergency Medical Services Organizations 
Support 
March 20, 2022 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. 
My name is Robert "Butch" Russell and l live in Windham. I serve as the President of the Maine 
Ambulance Association, a non-profit trade association committed to improving and supporting 
Maine's EMS system. Our members include emergency medical services of all sizes and corporate 
structures, and from every corner of the state. l am also the CEO of North East Mobile Health 
Services, a For-Proﬁt Ambulance Services based in Scarborough, Maine. 
We support LD 526 because we are an industry in Crisis. Ambulance Leaders, on the frontline of 
Maine's healthcare system, are dealing with a worsening crisis caused by funding gaps anda 
workforce shortage. We see in the news regularly, how EMS services in Maine are in trouble and 
nearing a breaking point. This funding would be a lifeline for many services and would help assure 
that life~saving services remain available for the citizens and visitors of the communities they 
serve. 
We want to remind the committee that this funding, although very important, is a one-time stop 
gap to assist services in need today. The funding would not help for future needs and without 
funding from other recommendations made by the Blue-Ribbon Commission that studied EMS in 
Maine, EMS services would continue to have shortfalls and remain in crisis. We must come up 
with ways to fund EMS to be sustainable in our state. We take this opportunity to ask for your 
support to many Bills this session that are geared to help our failing EMS system. 
Thank you for your support of Maine's EMS providers.

Maine Ambulance Association
