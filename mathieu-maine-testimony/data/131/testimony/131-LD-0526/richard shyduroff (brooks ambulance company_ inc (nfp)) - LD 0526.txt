good morning!
i am richard shyduroff of the towns of brooks & rockport,
and serve, wearing among other hats, as an ambulance driver for
our rural, non-profit, brooks ambulance company; and as the
ground vehicle maintenance supervisor; fund-raiser; and am also
a registered nr-emt candidate ...
i am writing today to first apologise for not being present in zoom
or f2f_mode, and am therefore submitting this letter-of-TOTAL-POSITIVE-SUPPORT for your 
and your staff's research for and authoring of LD526 ... 
i will return virtually after your legislative group's lunch break
at 2pm to listen closely to others' testimonies and comments,
and look forward to a net-YES! on this important motion and
enactment benefitting ems workers across the entire state of maine ...
hastily, but sincerely,
