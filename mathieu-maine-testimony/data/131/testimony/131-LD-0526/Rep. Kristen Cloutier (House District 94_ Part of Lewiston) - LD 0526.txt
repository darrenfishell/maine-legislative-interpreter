Testimony of Rep. Kristen Cloutier in support of 
LD 526, An Act to Provide Funding to Emergency Medical Services 
Organizations 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Good morning Senator Beebe-Center , Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of 
the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. Please accept this testimony in support of
LD 
526, An Act to Pr ovide Funding to Emergency Medical Services Organizations.
LD 526 provides a one-time General Fund appropriation of $25,000,000 in fiscal year 2023-24 to
the Department of Public Safety to ensure that emer gency medical services that are at risk of 
leaving their service areas remain accessible to their respective communities.
In the 130th Legislature, we
passed legislation
that
reaffirmed the importance of our emer gency 
medical services across the state and established a Blue Ribbon Commission to further study the
use of emer gency medical services in Maine.
The
report
that emer ged from the Blue Ribbon Commission
notes that reimbursements for 
emer gency medical services are not on par with the cost of providing those services and that the 
current subsidies we provide are insuf ficient. Further , the commission states that there is a 
deficiency of $70 million in funding each year for the next five years for transporting emer gency 
medical services across the state.
Increasing funding is among the first three recommendations highlighted in the report.
We each have our own personal story or know of others who have stories about the crucial care
received during an emer gency situation. Our communities should not have to worry that their 
most vital services–emer gency medical services–are in danger of being eliminated.
It’s our job to make sure these lifesaving services remain available.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely ,
Rep. Kristen S. Cloutier
Assistant House Majority Leader
District 94: Part of Lewiston
