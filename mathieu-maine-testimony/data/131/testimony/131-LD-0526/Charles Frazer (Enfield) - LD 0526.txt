RE: LD 526 
An Act to Provide Funding to Emergency Medical Services Organizations  
Speaker.  Rachel  Talbot Ross  of Portland  
 
 
Dear  Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee:   
 
The Howland Maine Fire/EMS Dep artmen t is a municipal first responder service within 
central Penobscot County and is the contracted provider for essential lifesaving  protections  to the 
Town of Enfield , Maine .  Howland is  championing  a new endeavor designed to ultimately  
provide a more effective, affordable  and sustainable Fire/EMS model for not only its current 
partner and client base, but also for a larger area of rural Maine.   This visionary initiative  to 
collaborate on a regional level  is driven by many factors, not the least of which is the 
overwhelming financial burden faced by  small Towns to house and operate a department .  Many 
of the municipalities involved in the Howland model have previously sponsored independent 
Fire/EMS Departments, but each of these efforts have failed due to limited resources.   The 
situation that the To wn of Enfield and others in our region are currently facing shows the dire 
need for additional funding for emergency medical service organizations.  The options on the 
northern portion of the State are extremely limited and expenses are overwhelming.  For such a 
basic, necessary service to be so dramatically underfunded, leaving volunteer departments in 
desperate situations to serve the communities that they are a part of, is a true crisis.  
 
The Town of Enfieldâ€™s  elected official s hereby express their suppo rt of this emergency 
bill to provide funding to emergency medical service organizations. We must work together to  
solve the current fire/EMS crisis in Maine to create acceptable levels of service and reliable 
responses  at reasonable rates , particularly in rural Maine .   
 
 
Sincerely , 
 
Charles Frazier  
 
Charles Frazier  
Town Manager  
Enfield , Maine
