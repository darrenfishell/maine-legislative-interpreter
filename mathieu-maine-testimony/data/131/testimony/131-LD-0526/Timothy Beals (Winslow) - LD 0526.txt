Written Testimony in Favor of LD 526, An Act to Provide Funding to Emergency Medical 
Services Organizations
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee:
My name is Tim Beals, I am the Executive Director of Delta Ambulance. Delta Ambulance is a 
regional not for profit community ambulance providing 13 towns in central Maine with 
Emergency ambulance service. Delta also provides inter-facility transports to two hospitals and 
multiple nursing homes.
Ambulance services are operating on fixed incomes. It matters not how many actual patient 
transports an agency does, the level of reimbursement does not cover the cost of doing business. 
Even for Delta is one of the largest ambulance services in Maine our reimbursement falls well 
short of the cost to provide service.  As the Blue Ribbon Commission pointed out there is a gap 
between what it costs and what we are paid.
Thus far we have relied on our reserves to supplement our revenues in order to continue 
providing service. Those will run out soon! And yet our fuel bill increased by 21%, our electric 
bill tripled and our mortgage interest has gone up.
How have we managed to cope? We have reduced spending on equipment purchases, delayed 
the purchase of other equipment, reduced funds for employee education, frozen the wages of 
leadership and cut full time positions. There really isnâ€™t anything left.
We need your help so that our employees are paid a wage commensurate with the important job 
they do. We need your help to replace aging equipment.  
LD 526 will not solve all the problems facing the EMS system in Maine, the solutions are more 
complex. However, this legislation will provide immediate relief and give us the time we need to 
make meaningful changes to the EMS system. 
I urge you to support and pass LD 526, An Act to Provide Funding to Emergency Medical 
Services Organizations.
Respectfully,
Timothy Beals
Executive Director
