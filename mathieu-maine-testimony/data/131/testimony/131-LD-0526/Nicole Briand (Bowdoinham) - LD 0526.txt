I’m writing in support of this bill, as it is a needed first step to help stabilize emergency medical 
services in Maine. Bowdoinham is at risk of no t having emergency medical services as of July 1, 
2023.   Bowdoi nham currently  contracts for No rth Ea st Mobile Hea lth for amb ulance ser vice and 
currently working to find service for  fiscal year 2024.  
 
Bowdoinham is a small community with a population of 3,011, a volunteer Fire & EMS 
Department in Sagadahoc County .  We have three neighbors, Richmond, Bowdoin and Topsham, 
as Merrymeeting Bay separates us from Woolwich and Bath.    
 
We’ve been contracting for North Eas t as our ambulance service provider for many years.  Our 
currently  contract for services is for $50,000 per year  and has been has July 1 , 2021.  In 
December  of 2022, Bowdoinham received  a requested contract add endum of $65,500 per mon th 
starting on J anuary 1, 2023.  Long story short, s ince December, North East has agreed to 
maintain Bowdoinham ’s existing contract and has obtained Lisbon EMS for our mutual aid in 
place of Topsham  thru June 30, 2023 .   
 
For ambulance s ervice starting July 1, 2023, Bowdoinham  discussing possible  options with 
North  East & Lisbon  and w e have also approached both Gardiner and Topsham  for ambulance 
service.  Both Ga rdiner and Topsham would need to expan d their existing  service in order to 
handle Bowdoinham ’s 250 c alls per yea r.  For Gardiner , this would include having to staff an 
ambulance in Richmond to reduce the response time  to Bowdoinham.  For Topsham, they have 
no interest in being a regional s ervice provider , their  focus is providing s ervice to Topsham.  We 
have also talked with Saga dahoc County and Midcoast Council of G overn ments to study the 
county provid ing ambulance s ervice.  Lastly, Bowdoinham is looking creating its own 
ambulance s ervice,  which would take a substantial  capital investm ent for our small town.   
Addition ally, for Bowdoinham to move in this di rection , we will need time in order to d evelop 
and staff our own ser vice. 
 
 
 
 As you can see, Bowdoinham has v ery limited options .  Our immediate goal is to obtain 
ambulance ser vice for fiscal year 2024 ( July 1, 2023 -June 30 , 2024 ).  Then use FY2024 to  
develop a long -term ambulance s ervice for Bowdoi nham.  We would gr eatly apprec iate any 
funding and assistance from the S tate to help address ambulance ser vice. 
 
Thank you for your tim e and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,
