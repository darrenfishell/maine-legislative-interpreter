LD 526
Please accept this testimony as a voice of support for LD 526.  As you are all well aware, all 
emergency services in Maine are at a breaking point with little to no relief in sight.  Our 
departments are struggling to staff ambulances, we are asking more from our taxpayers to 
pay a fair salary to our employees, and we compete with our mutual aid partners for the small
amount of workforce to keep our calls from going unanswered.  While I believe this only 
scratches the surface of a catastrophe that is sitting at our doorstep, this will at least allow 
some relief to keep the doors open.  
Thank you for your support 
Respectfully,
Chris Whytock
Chief of Department
Rockland Fire & EMS
