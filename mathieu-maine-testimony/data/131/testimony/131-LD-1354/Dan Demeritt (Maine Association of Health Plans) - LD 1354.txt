The Maine Bureau of Insurance  publishes a Consumer’s Guide to Medicare Supplemental 
Insurance that include s an explanation of core and additional benefits included in Medicare 
Supplemental Plans available to Maine consumers.  
 
The guide includes a side -by-side comparison of plan benef its that include 100% coverage of 
Medicare Part B Excess Charges in plans G and F.  A printout of the comparison page is included 
with my testimony.1  
 
Many c arriers  offering Medicare Supplemental pl ans in Maine use similar charts in their 
marketing materials to help educate consumers about their options and to demonstrate how 
benefits vary across the available plans in the marketplace.  
 
We are happy to help be a resource as the committee considers this proposal to require policy 
disclosures related to Medicare Part B excess charges.
