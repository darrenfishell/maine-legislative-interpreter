Re: L.D. 1354, An Act to  Protect Medicare Beneficiaries from Surprise Bills and to Inform 
Medicare Beneficiaries About Medicare Part B Excess Charges 
Dear Senator Bailey , Representative Perry , and Members of the Committee:  
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 1354.  The purpose of this letter is to provide 
you with background information.  
This bill amends two chapters of Title 321 to prohibit physicians from balance billing Medicare 
beneficiaries. “Balance bil l” is defined as charging  or collecting any amount above the Medicare -
approved amount for a service, procedure or treatment paid to a physician.  It requires physicians to post notice of this prohibition in a conspicuous location in their offices. It gives  the patient the 
ability to file a complaint with the respective governing board for a physician’s failure to comply with the section and the board the power to investigate and resolve such complaints.  
The bill also amends Title 24 -A’s chapter on Medicare Supplement Insurance Policies
2 to 
require Medicare supplement policies and certificates to disclose whether the policy provides coverage for Medicare Part B excess charges. Both Medicare Supplement Plans G and F cover Part B excess charges. These plans a re standardized, and companies are already required to 
describe the principal benefits and coverage provided by these policies.
3 Accordingly, the 
proposed subsection language is not necessary.  
“Medicare Part B excess charges” means the amount in excess of the Medicare- approved amount 
that some doctors, who do not accept Medicare assignment, charge. This can result in the patient being charged not only the standard 20% that original Medicare does not cover, but also the additional amount the doctor charges.  
It is unclear why the bill involves  only medical doctors and osteopaths.  
Currently eight states prohibit these types of excess charges.
