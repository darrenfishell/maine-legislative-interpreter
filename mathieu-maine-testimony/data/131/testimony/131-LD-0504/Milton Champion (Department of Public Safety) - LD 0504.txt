Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and Distinguished Members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee, l am Milton Champion, Executive Director of the Gambling 
Control Unit within the Department of Public Safety. I am here today on behalf of the 
Department of Public Safety to testify “Neither For Nor Against” LD 504 which is an Act 
Regarding Licensing Fees for Small Slot Machine Distributors. 
Currently by statute each casino can have up to 1,500 slot machines. Oxford has 958 with 
available 542 which when divided by 50 allows for 11 additional distributors. Hollywood 
has 654 with available 846 which when divided by 50 allows for 17 additional 
distributors. If 11 of those were used by both casinos, Hollywood could have an additional 
6 distributors. 
ll x $50,000 = $550,000.00 
6 x $50,000 = $300,000.00 
total initial applications = $850,000.00 
17 slot machine distributor renewals = $170,000.00 
slot machine registration fee of $100.00 annually for 1,388 additional machines would be 
$138,800.00 initially and each year thereafter 
There are 32 slot machine manufacturers and/or distributors of which 5 are currently 
licensed in Maine. This would certainly allow for the offering of many machines 
available in the competitive properties in Massachusetts and Connecticut. 
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the committee today, and 1 would be 
happy to answer any questions you may have at this time. 
Respectfully
