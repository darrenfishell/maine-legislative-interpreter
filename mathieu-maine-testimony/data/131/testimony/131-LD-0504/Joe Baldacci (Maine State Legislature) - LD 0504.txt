Senator, District 9 l3 l st Legislature Augusta, Maine 04333 
Testimony of Senator Joe Baldacci introducing LD 504 “An Act Regarding Licensing Fees for 
Small Slot Machine Distributors ” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. 
February 27, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Distinguished Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. I am Senator Joe Baldacci, andI 
proudly represent Senate District 9, which is made up of Bangor and Hennon. I am here today to 
present LD 504, “An Act Regarding Licensing Fees for Small Slot Machine Distributors. ” 
As the bill summary indicates, this bill sets the initial application fee for a slot machine 
distributor that distributes fewer than 50 machines annually at $50,000 and the annual renewal 
fee for those distributors at $10,000. The bill would not impact any of the current licenses, or 
state revenues, but could encourage new vendors to participate in Maine. The current slot 
machine distributor license fee is cost prohibitive for smaller distributors, some of whom offer 
new slots customers are not able to play. 
Thank you all for your time and consideration. I would ask that you direct your questions to Milt 
Champion, Director of the Gambling Control Unit in the Department of Public Safety.
