LD 718
LD 718 Ought Not Pass.  There are other ways to accommodate sludge at Juniper 
Ridge Landfill.  There should be no excuse by Casella that they can't accommodate 
sludge under LD 1639 because they had ample time to prepare for not having the 
same amount of Out of State Bulky Waste going back to when that bill was enacted.
