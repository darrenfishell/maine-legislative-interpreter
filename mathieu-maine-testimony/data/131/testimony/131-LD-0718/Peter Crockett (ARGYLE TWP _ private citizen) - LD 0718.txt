I am saddened, but not surprised with the need to testify , once again, on how 
destructive a practice Cassella wants to be allowed to perform on a daily basis in 
order to keep poisoning Maine for their bottom line.   How much poison does this 
state have to consume in order to keep their stockholders happy?  The current science 
is just starting to realize how destructive all of these pfas chemicals, which have been 
forced upon our natural world for decades now with little to NO consideration 
what-so-ever.   Regardless of these KNOWN hazards Cassella is whining about 
needing to use some of the most toxic elements commonly found to bulk up their 
sludge without giving any consideration to any alternate methods of stabilizing 
sludges which have TOO high a liquid content to be landfilled properly!     There are 
a number of other avenues to provided the required result.  One of the easiest would 
be to require any sludge arriving at the landfill to be dry enough so it doesnt need to 
be stabilized.   Any solution to this problem will require someone somewhere to 
spend more money than they already do on sludge disposal.   This sad fact happens to 
be the stark reality of life.    I personally, would prefer to see a little more money 
spent throughout the state to address this problem then I would to see our worlds' 
health have to take ANOTHER hit in the face !    How much poison do we have to 
consume in order to provide a large enough bottom line for an out of state company, 
whose profits come from our endurance of their unnecessary poisons!      If this 
company is was as concerned with meeting the states waste hierarchy guidelines  as 
they are with profits they would never seek such a vile route to perform a task which 
has many other solutions.  The bottom line is,  if the sludge were dry enough this 
entire issue would not even be an issue at all.
