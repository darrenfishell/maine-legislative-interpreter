Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Members 
of the Joint Connnitte on Environment and Natural Resources: 
My name is Paul Schroeder and I am a resident of Orono. For many years, beginning in early 2004,I 
have followed closely the establishment and growth of the Juniper Ridge Landﬁll, formerly known as 
the West Old Town Landﬁll. 
I believe that documents from the early years of this project will help members of this committee to 
understand the economic and political forces that led to the intractable problems that Maine faces 
today. In those early years I helped to compile a sample set of documents that illustrate this process, 
and published them as a set of web pages in 2004 and 2005. 
I have retrieved and compiled those early web pages, and have brought copies here of the Dump 
Documents Dispatch. Unfortunately I only have 14 copies to share today. For committee members who 
may not get a physical copy today or who may want to find this online, here is the web address to read 
or download the Documents Dispatch:

Please excuse the lengthy web address. 
I hope that as you consider LD 718, or any other legislation aimed at rolling back protections that are 
now in place, you will take the provided documents into consideration. 
With appreciation, 
PM C»§¢h/‘cl-€oC¢/' 
Paul C. Schroeder
