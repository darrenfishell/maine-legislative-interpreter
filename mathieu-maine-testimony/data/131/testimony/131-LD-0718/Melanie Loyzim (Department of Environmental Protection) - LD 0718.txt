Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am 
Melanie Loyzim, Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), 
speaking in support of L.D. 718 if amended. 
in 2022, the Maine Legislature passed P.L. 2021, Cha 
amended the statutory definition of “waste that is generated within the State.” This law 
specifies that, beginning February 1, 2023, if the total weight of residue generated ina 
al c endar year by an incineration, recycling, or solid waste processing facility that is pter 626 (L.D. 1639), which

disposed of or otherwise placed in a solid waste landfill in that calendar year exceeds 
the total weight of the solid waste initially generated within the State that was 
incinerated or processed by that facility in that calendar year, any such excess residue 
generated by that facility is not considered “waste generated within the State.“ Maine 
law prohibits any solid waste disposal facility owned by the State from accepting waste 
that is not generated within the Statez , so this excess residue cannot be disposed at the 
Juniper Ridge Landfill. 
Further, P.L. 2021, Chapter 626, strengthened recycling standards specifically for solid 
waste processing facilities that accept exclusively construction and demolition debris 
(CDD), and that accepted more than 200,000 tons of CDD in 2018 —which applies only 
to the ReSource facility in Lewiston. All other solid waste processing facilities that 
generate residue for disposal must recycle or generate a fuel from at least 50% of the 
waste they process. Chapter 626 required the ReSource facility to achieve that same 
rate by January 2026. 
The law requires that ReSource must reuse or recycle, through methods other than 
placement in a landfill, at least 30% of CDD processed by January 1, 2024, at least 40% 
by January 1, 2025, and at least 50% by January 1, 2026. The intent of the law is to 
maximize recycling of CDD statewide, and to minimize the volume of residue from 
processing out of state CDD that is disposed in state-owned landfills. 
The Department understands that the sponsor of L.D. 718 intends the bill be amended 
to postpone for 2 years the limitation established by P.L. 2021, Chapter 626 on the 
amount of residue that can be sent from a CDD processing facility to a state-owned 
landfill, and to postpone for 2 years the required increases in recycling rates for the 
ReSource facility.

The Department supports this delay in order to ensure an adequate supply of 
structurally large bulky waste to mix with sludge in the state-owned landfill while the 
Department and stakeholders work to make sludge easier to safely place in a landfill 
(without bulking) and to establish alternative methods for sludge disposal in Maine 
besides landfilling. Wastewater treatment districts are already exploring options for 
enhanced dewatering, drying, pyrolysis, and other technologies that would reduce the 
volume, weight and moisture content of their sludge. However, these are expensive 
investments that require time to design, fund and construct. 
The Department supports continued efforts to increase the use of Maine-generated 
demolition debris for bulking Maine’s wastewater sludge, and to process sludge in ways 
that reduce the need for bulking and the volume that must be landfilled. Postponing the 
requirements of P.L. 2021, Chapter 626 keeps the pressure on these goals while 
providing short-term flexibility to meet an immediate need — to safely treat Maine’s 
wastewater. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
