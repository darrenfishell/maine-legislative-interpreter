Portland Watr District 
FROM SEBAGO LAKE TO CASCO BAY 
TESTIMONY OF THE PORTLAND WATER DISTRICT IN SUPPORT OF 
LD 718 - AN ACT TO INCREASE THE BENEFICIAL REUSE OF CONSTRUCTION AND 
DEMOLITION DEBRIS 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Distinguished Members of the Environment and 
Natural Resources Committee, my name is Scott Firmin, and I am the Director of Wastewater 
Services for the Portland Water District. I provide this testimony in support of LD 718. 
The Portland Water District was created by the State Legislature in 1908 to provide drinking water to 
people in greater Portland. Today, PWD provides drinking water to over 200,000 people in ll 
communities, and wastewater treatment services to six of those connnunities. The affairs of PWD are 
managed by a Board of Trustees composed of ll members, all popularly elected by a plurality of the 
voters from the communities they represent. 
Like all wastewater utilities in Maine, our operations, costs, and ability to protect Maine’s waters 
have been affected by the actions that have restricted our very limited biosolids disposal capacity. 
The Juniper Ridge Landﬁll is essentially the only outlet for the overwhelming majority of Maine 
wastewater biosolids. In February, biosolids disposal came to a halt when the landﬁll ceased 
acceptance biosolids. There was no place in Maine for wastewater utilities to send biosolids.

While there are many factors that have contributed to the biosolids situation, one of them is the need 
to mix bulky waste with biosolids to provide stability in the landﬁll. Because biosolids are forced to 
landﬁlls as the sole management option any drop in the volume of bulky waste has a negative impact 
on disposal. A dramatic decrease ‘ in bulky waste was related to LD I639. 
A signiﬁcant volume of biosolids is currently being sent to New Brunswick, Canada, because of 
limitation at the Juniper RidgeLand ﬁll. In March 2023, 100% of the biosolids generated at PWD’s 
Westbrook Wastewater Treatment Facility and 81% of biosolids generated at PWD’s East End 
Wastewater Treatment Facility (the largest municipal wastewater treatment facility in Maine) were 
sent to New Brunswick. For reference, that’s 2,054 wet tons hauled in 73 tractor trailer trucks. This is 
expensive and unsustainable. 
PWD has engaged an engineering consultant to complete a comprehensive Biosolids Master Plan. 
This project will evaluate regional options to manage biosolids through volume reduction (less to 
manage) and thermal technologies with the intent to reduce PFAS levels in the biosolids dramatically. 
The Master Plan will include schedules and planning level costs for the solutions. We will share this 
information during next year’s legislative session. Any solution will likely take 3 to 5 years to 
implement will require signiﬁcant assistance from funding sources. The suppoit of the regulatory and 
legislative enviromnent will be critical as the solution develops.

LD 718 will essentially pause LD l639 for just over a year so we have time to develop a solution. 
The pause will not solve the issue, but having more bulky waste will help Juniper Ridge Landﬁll to 
accept the biosolids in the short term so that we can solve the problem in the long-term. PWD urges 
you to vote in favor of LD 718. LD 718 is a critical part of the path from today’s crisis to tomorrow ’s 
sustainable management of Mainels biosolids. 
Thank you for your consideration.
