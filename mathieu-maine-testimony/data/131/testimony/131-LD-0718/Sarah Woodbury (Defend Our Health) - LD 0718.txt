in Opposition to LD 718 “An Act to Increase the Beneﬁcial Reuse of Construction and 
Demolition Debris”. 
Before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee 
May 8, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee. My name is Sarah Woodbury. l am the director of advocacy for Defend 
Our Health. Defend Our Health’s mission is to make sure that everyone has equal access to 
safe food and drinking water, healthy homes and products that are toxic~free and climate 
friendly. l am here to testify in opposition of LD 718 “An Act to Increase the Beneﬁcial Reuse of 
Construction and Demolition Debris”. 
LD 718 once again opens up Maine to become the dumping ground for the rest of New England 
by allowing out of state waste to be shipped into our state and disposed of in Juniper Ridge, the 
state-run landﬁll. A landfill that is supposed to be used soley for in-state waste. We've heard the 
claims from Casella Waste Systems that this out of state bulky waste is necessary to stabilize 
the landﬁll due to increased sludge disposal. They have increased costs on municipalities 
across the state claimingthat they need those funds for increased trucking costs to truck the 
PFAS-contaminated sludge out of state. Casella grosses over $1 billion annually managing 
waste streams across the Northeast. In fact, a recent press release from Casella published in 
Vermont Biz, states that Casella’s first quarter earnings in 2023 are up 12%‘ . That 12% is being 
made on the backs of all Maine taxpayers who have seen their sewer rates increase over the 
past few months due to this manufactured crisis. And Casella has stated publically that they are 
not using those increased fees for trucking costs, but rather to market their PFAS-contaminated 
compost to other states with more lax environmental regulations than Maine. 
We have heard over and over how the increase in sludge due to the passage of LD 1911 amnd 
the lack of out of state bulky waste (OBW) has led to destabilization of the landfill. This makes 
little sense considering 95% of the sludge in state was already being landfilled before the 
passage of LD 1911. After the contamination of Stoneridge Farm became public in 2019, the 
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) halted the spread of sludge until it was tested for 
three types of PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, & PFBS).1 When DEP tested sludge for those three PFAS, 
over 95% of the sludge tested exceeded the Department's screening levels for at least one of

those compounds, showing just how extensive the contamination is in biosolids. While some 
was diverted to Hawk Ridge to be turned into "compost" , a majority was landﬁlled. ln fact, Data 
reported by the corporation shows no increase in municipal sludge disposal at the landfill since 
the passage of LD 1911 and LD 1639. There was a large increase in sludge in the landﬁll in 
2019 and 2020 when the DEP’s standards first went into effect, but, from 2021 to 2022, sludge 
disposal only increased by 6.1% while oversized bulky waste slightly declined by 3.9%. And LD 
1639 didn’t go into effect until February of 2023. 
We understand the frustrations of the wastewater districts. They are being put in a tough 
position and need solutions. lt’s unfortunate that the only solutions that the landfill managers are 
willing to even consider is pushing this legislation to overturn good public policy to help line their 
pockets. The voices of the communities that live near Juniper Ridge and impacted by this 
legislation have been largely ignored. Once again, this is yet another example of frontline and 
indigenous communities being brushed aside for the sake of corporate profits. An all too familiar 
story. We urge the committee to protect those communities, not corporate profit and vote “ought 
not to pass" on LD 718.
