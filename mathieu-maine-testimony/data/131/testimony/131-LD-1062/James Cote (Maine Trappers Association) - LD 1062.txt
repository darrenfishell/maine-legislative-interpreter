Testimony of the Maine Trappers Association 
In Opposition to LD 1062 
An Act to Allow a Landowner or Maintainer of Trails to Lethally Remove Nuisance Beaver 
April 24, 2023 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and members of the committee, my name is James Cote and 
l am here on behalf of the Maine Trappers Association in opposition to LD 1062. 
This bill allows a landowner, a person on behalf of a landowner or a person who maintains a trail as part 
of a club or organization that maintains trails to take or kill nuisance beaver. 
The Maine Trappers Association has long opposed efforts that would authorize the taking or killing of 
nuisance beaver without appropriate oversight of DlFW. With that being said, we also recognize that 
beaver populations in Maine are on the rise, and with increased and spreading populations also comes 
more opportunities for beaver-landowner conflicts. 
While we oppose this speciﬁc legislation that would grant broad authority to kill nuisance beavers at-will 
and with no oversight from DIFW, we would encourage the proponents to work with the Department to 
find solutions for speciﬁc nuisance beaver issues, which we are aware and thankful that the Department 
has done with other landowners in the past. We would also recommend that proponents work with MTA 
to find licensed trappers in their area that may be willing to assist them with resolving nuisance beaver 
issues. 
For these reasons, we respectfully oppose LD 1062. Thank you for your consideration.
