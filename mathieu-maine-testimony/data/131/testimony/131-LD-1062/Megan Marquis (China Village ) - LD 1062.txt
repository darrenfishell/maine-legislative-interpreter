LD 1062
Dear Inland Fisheries and Wildlife committee,
My name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China Village. I am writing today to ask 
you to oppose LD 1062.
This affects me because I do not feel safe knowing that someone proposed such a 
personal law that can only be applicable to them and their immediate anger towards 
beavers- enough to verbally insult them in proposed legislation. I also do not feel safe 
knowing that there is someone so irrationally angry they would premediate shooting 
something that is just trying to exist in my community. 
I oppose this law - because I clearly support the beavers right to exist and the fact that
there are already appropriate channels available in the state of Maine - that will allow 
the person to safely re-locate the beaver instead of resorting to unnecessary killing. 
We already have a solution in Maine that doesn't involve death, so let's just use that.
So unless you are on a weird vendetta against beavers, oppose LD 1062
