“An Act to  Allow a Landowner or Maintainer of Trails to Lethally 
Remove Nuisance Beaver ” 
 
April 24, 2023 
Patrick Strauch, Executive Director  
 
Good afternoon, Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the  
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife . I’m Patrick Strauch, the Executive  
Director of the Maine Forest Products Council. The Maine Forest Products Council is 
an organization representing more than 300 members from all facets of t he forest  
products industry. We also have more than 8 million acres of dues paying members.  
 
I am submitting testimony  today neither for nor against  LD 1062, “An Act t o Allow a 
Landowner or Maintainer of Trails to Lethally Rem ove Nuisance Beaver .” 
 For this bill, I am go ing to keep my testimony short and sweet. Current law already 
allows a person to take or kill a nuisance beaver on behalf of a landowner. As the 
representative of more than 8 million acres of fores t landowners  that largely allow trail 
access , the Council is uncomfortable with the idea of allowing clubs or organizations 
that maintain trails to kill or take a beaver without first consulting with the landowner . 
We would , however, support steps to streamline the permission process to allow clubs 
and trail maintainers to quickly respond to nuisance bea ver situations . 
 Currently, the system  in place keeps the lines of communication between landowners 
and clubs open. Any changes considered by this committee should not change this 
dynamic.   Thank you for your consideration.
