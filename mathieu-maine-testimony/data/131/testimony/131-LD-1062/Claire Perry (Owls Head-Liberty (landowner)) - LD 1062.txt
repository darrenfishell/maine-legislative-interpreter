Dear IF&W Committee Members: 
The beaver is perhaps the one true keystone species here in Maine. 
Nobody should be given random authority to kill beaver at will, because they are 
being inconvenienced.  
Within hours, a game warden or other IF&W authority can asses a "problem beaver" 
situation and come up with a workable solution. That is their job. This is good 
management and it should not be compromised.
