Testimony of Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services 
testifying in opposition to 
LD 121, An Act to Expand Health Insurance Coverage to Certain State Employees 
Sponsored by Sen. Hickman 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services, l am Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative 
and Strategic Operations for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and l am 
providing testimony today against LD 121. 
lt is important to note that the State Employee Health Plan is currently offered continuously to 
seasonal employees. However, during the period they are not actually working for the State, 
the State does not subsidize their premiums and the employee is responsible for the State's 
premium portion in addition to their own. This is the same requirement, with the exception of 
the Voluntaly Employee Incentive Program for full time, year-round State employees who are 
out on extended unpaid leaves of absence. 
Across all departments and agencies, the State currently has more than 500 seasonal 
positions. The fiscal burden of this bill would primarily be borne by departments with high 
concentrations of seasonal employees- —namely the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry and the Department of Transportation. Furthermore, the State has no guarantee 
that seasonal employees will return to employment each season, as a result departments 
could end up paying for benefits while an employee is not in active status only to learn at the 
start of the next season that the employee does not intend to return to work—of the currently 
active seasonal employees only 17% are returning employees. This could also interfere with 
departments ’ hiring and ability to staff up in a timely manner if there was a personal financial 
incentive for employees to be dishonest about their intentions to return in order to maintain 
their substantially subsidized health insurance coverage. . 
Virtually all seasonal employees currently fall within Premium Tier 2 (see attached) with a base 
annual salary of between $30,000-$80,000. Under this bill the State would contribute 90% 
toward their health insurance premiums, a biweekly cost of $472.71 ($12,290.46 annually) if 
insuring just the employee, no spouse or dependents. The Governor's biennial budget 
PHONE: (207) 624-7800 www.Mainc.g0v FAX: (207) 62451804
proposes adjusting the Premium Tiers—raising the $30,000 threshold to $50,000 and the 
$80,000 threshold to $100,000. If this proposal is adopted, the overwhelming majority of 
seasonal employees would then fall within Premium Tier 1, which under this bill the State 
would contribute 95%, a biweekly cost of $497.59 ($12,937.34 annually). Based on that, if you 
make a gross assumption that the average seasonal position has a four,-month duration, the 
total additional cost to the State of subsidizing year-round health insurance forjust the 
employee, in each seasonal position currently occupied would exceed $2.75 million annually. lf 
all available positions were filled the cost could exceed $4 million annually. If those employees 
were all covering spouses and children, the costs could range from $5.5 million to $8.75 million 
depending upon the number of positions filled. 
From an administrative perspective, the Office of Employee Health and Wellness is not 
currently equipped with an automated system to directly bill seasonal employees no longer on 
payroll for their premiums; each insurance premium (dental, medical and vision) is billed 
separately and manually. This bill would significantly increase the volume of direct billing and 
require additional administrative support to execute. 
Furthermore, in many instances when an employee goes off payroll it has been difficult to obtain 
the employee portion of premiums and to keep the employee ’s health insurance in good 
standing. This bill would put the State Employee Health Plan at greater exposure for not 
receiving the employee share of the premiums owed when the employee is not in active status 
and their premiums cannot be automatically deducted from their pay. These uncollectable 
unpaid premiums are a “loss for bad debt" to the State Employee Health Plan. 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify. l am happy to answer any questions.
