Testimony of Senator Craig V. Hickman in Support of 
LD 121, An Act To Expand Health Insurance Coverage To Certain State Employees 
Before the Senate Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services
Thursday, February 9, 2023
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and honorable members of the committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services. My name is Craig Hickman. I represent Senate 
District 14, 12 towns in Southern Kennebec County, in the Maine Senate. Thank you for the 
opportunity to present LD 121, An Act To Expand Health Insurance Coverage To Certain State 
Employees. 
I present this bill to ensure that, as we work to expand health care to more Maine people as a 
moral imperative, we don’t forget to take care of our own. 
According to the state Office of Employee Health and Benefits, over 500 state employees are 
seasonal or session-only. While these employees are working, the state pays toward their health 
insurance premiums just like any other state employee — but between seasons or sessions, these 
employees are required to pay the full cost in order to maintain their coverage. 
LD 121 requires the state to continue to pay its share of the premium between seasons or 
sessions unless the employee has coverage under another plan. It’s a matter of fairness to all our 
state employees. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I will gladly take any questions you may 
have.
