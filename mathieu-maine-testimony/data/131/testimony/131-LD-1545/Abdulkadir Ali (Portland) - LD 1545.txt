An

Communities

Incr easing

Punishment
for
Crimes
Involving
Fentanyl
Dear
Senator
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury,
and
Members
of
the
Committee
on
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety:
My
name
is
Abdul
Ali
and
I
am
the
Advocacy
Director
with
Maine
Youth
Justice.
I
reside
in
Portland.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
provide
testimony
in
opposition
to
LD
986.
Maine
Youth
Justice
is
a
nonpartisan
campaign
fighting
to
end
youth
incarceration
in
Maine
and
invest
in
a
range
of
community-based
supports
that
respond
to
young
people’s
needs,
support
families,
and
build
community .
We
are
a
campaign
led
by
young
people
who
have
been
incarcerated
in
Long
Creek
and
are
directly
impacted
by
the
juvenile
justice
system.
Today
I
am
here
to
testify
on
Maine’s
mental
health,
addiction,
drug
purchase,
and
distribution
issues.
We
all
agree
that
the
drug
problem
in
America
has
exceeded
the
limit
of
handling
this
situation
in
a
solution-based
process
so
we
can
have
healthier
communities
and
safer
environments
for
our
children,
our
elderly,
our
sick,
and
all
citizens
of
Maine’s
population.
I
stand
firmly
that
this
bill,
and
bills
like
this,
will
be
a
detriment
to
the
source
and
issue
we
are
trying
to
resolve
today.
Research
has
shown
numerous
explanations
on
how
the
policing
and
criminalization
of
drugs
only
harm
the
community
and
do
not
solve
the
direct
issues
of
distribution,
supply
and
demand,
addiction
(which
is
a
mental
health
and
physical
health
problem),
over-policing,
and
harms
that
conclude
in
violence,
negative
health
outcomes,
and
possibly
death.

As
a
person
that
grew
up
in
numerous
communities
that
were
criminalized
for
drug
possession,
like
marijuana,
I
saw
day-to-day
issues
that
caused
increased
anxiety,
stress,
and
fear
had
only
increased
the
usage,
the
hiding,
the
distribution,
and
the
spreading.
If
this
bill,
today,
spoke
primarily
on
the
mental
health
aspects
of
stress,
anxiety,
anger,
frustration,
and
trauma,
and
the
ways
of
relieving
these
issues
through
a
solution-based
approach
rooted
in
clinical
evidence
on
addiction
and
mental
health,
I
would
have
urged
you
to
pass.
But
it
is
not.
The
mistake
was
made
in
the
late
1990s
by
creating
drug
laws
that
ended
up
increasing
violence
and
crime
all
the
way
up
until
the
1994
crime
bill
that
was
passed
by
President
Bill
Clinton.
Violent
crime
did
not
erupt
to
the
levels
that
it
had
in
this
country
until
drug
laws
were
passed.
By
passing
this
bill,
we
will
see
the
exact
same
negative
effect
that
we
saw
in
the
past
three
decades.
I,
myself,
have
been
in
the
life
where
drug
use,
selling
of
drugs,
and
the
environment
where
drugs
and
alcohol
were
used
for
excitement,
happiness,
and
to
escape
the
mental
depression
that
we
were
facing
in
our
lives
due
to
the
communities
we
lived
in,
following
the
destruction
of
communities
because
of
policies
that
were
created
to
criminalize
drug
usage
and
the
selling
of
it.
The
only
solutions
are
clinical
treatment
and
evidence-based
solutions
for
mental
and
behavioral
health,
and
increasing
equitable
opportunities
for
a
better
livelihood.
Between
the
1980s
and
the
early
2000s,
the
prison
population
has
risen
from
200,000
to
2.3
million
people.
That
resulted
in
the
loss
of
jobs,
broken
families,
increased
violence,
increased
crime,
financial
investment
in
jails
and
prisons,
and
an
increased
number
of
police
officers.
Thus,
we
have
the
highest
population
of
police
officers,
the
highest
population
of
people
in
prison,
the
highest
level
of
depression,
and
amongst
the
highest,
compared
to
other
counties,
when
it
comes
to
drug
and
alcohol
addiction.
If
this
bill,
alongside
the
other
bills
in
this
year’s
legislature
this
session,
passes,
I
promise
you
the
harms
that
will
come
out
of
it
will
be
greater
than
what
we
are
facing
today.
The
only
solution
we
have
is
to
act
upon
clinical
research
that
proves
that
people
who
are
addicted
to
drugs
and
alcohol
can
heal
through
support,
medical
professional
guidance,
and
therapeutic
processes.

Instead
of
investing
the
money
in
the
court
systems
and
refilling
our
jails
again,
like
the
way
we
have
done
in
the
past
three
decades,
we
could
invest
in
clinical
studied
based
research
that
proves
us
the
solution:
Healthy
outcomes.
I
urge
this
committee
not
to
pass
this
bill
alongside
the
three
other
bills
that
have
been
presented
today,
or
any
other
bill
ever
that
will
increase
the
drug
crime
rates,
and
invest
in
the
infrastructure,
resources,
and
healing.
When
coming
to
supply
and
demand,
when
you
have
less
demand
after
people
have
been
healed,
the
supply
will
decrease
because
there
is
no
demand
for
it.
There
will
be
little
to
no
use
for
it
when
we
have
healthy
Mainers
that
have
been
healed
from
this
disease
that
we
have
been
fighting
for
decades.
It’s
the
simple
concept
of
supply
and
demand.
When
we
finally
have
healthy
Mainers
that
have
been
healed
from
this
disease
we
have
been
fighting
against
for
decades,
there
will
naturally
become
less
demand.
The
decrease
in
demand
will
decrease
supply.
And
these
suppliers
will
move
to
legal
financial
pathways
to
improve
their
livelihood,
as
long
as
they
are
able
to
see
such
opportunities
in
their
communities.
We
stand
firm
and
urge
this
committee
not
to
pass
this
bill
or
any
other
bills
that
result
in
the
increased
criminalization
of
any
drugs.
Instead,
invest
in
the
healing
and
prospering
of
communities
and
surely
we
will
see
better
results.
For
these
reasons,
we
urge
this
Committee
vote
ought
not
to
not
pass
LD
986.
Thank
you.

Imprisonment,
whether
for
drug
or
other
offenses,
actually
leads
to
much
higher
risk
of
drug
overdose
upon
release.
“During
the
first
2
weeks
after
release,
the
risk
of
death
among
former
inmates
was
12.7
(95%
CI,
9.2
to
17.4)
times
that
among
other
state
residents,
with
a
markedly
elevated
relative
risk
of
death
from
drug
overdose
(129;
95%
CI,
89
to

The
leading
causes
of

among

were
drug
overdose,

disease,
homicide,
and
suicide.”
