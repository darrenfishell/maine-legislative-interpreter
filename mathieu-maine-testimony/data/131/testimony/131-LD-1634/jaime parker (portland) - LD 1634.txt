LD 1634
Honorable Representatives;
I am writing to express my strongest SUPPORT for LD 1634.  Giving municipalities 
the ability to take proactive measures to reduce speeds without a DOT speed study is 
an essential step in the journey to make our streets safer for all users.
Thank you,
Jaime Parker
