Thank you to very much to the members of the Committee for your work on LD 1634 and I 
support this bill. My name is Sarah Cushman and I represent my firm, Cushman Transportation 
Consulting, LLC. As a transportation planning consultant, I specialize in pedestrian, bicycle and 
public transportation projects and I’ve worked with people in many different communities who 
struggle with the local context issues that other folks raised during today’s hearing, 4/25/23.  
 
I shared my comments via Zoom and wanted to follow up with a couple of links regarding use 
of the 85th percentile for setting speed limits, hoping they might be helpful for your work 
session. 
 
• I may have referenced the same recent National Transportation Safety Board report that 
Senator Bennet mentioned: “Reducing Speeding-Related Crashes Involving Passenger 
Vehicles”, and there’s a section that questions the longstanding 85th percentile rule of 
thumb and offers alternate recommendations. The discussion and recs are on pages 21-
29 (pages 33-41 of the PDF): https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-
studies/Documents/SS1701.pdf   
• In addition, in recent work I’ve found other states are working with lower percentiles 
now, such as Oregon, which also has a significant rural population. From the Oregon 
DOT site: “Previous studies suggest posting speeds near the 85th percentile speed 
minimize crash occurrence and provide favorable driver compliance. More recent studies 
suggest that posting near the 50th percentile speed may be more appropriate for 
roadways within urban areas where there is development and vulnerable users.”

Thank you very much again for listening, for your thoughtful discernment on this important 
issue, and I urge you to vote Ought to Pass.
