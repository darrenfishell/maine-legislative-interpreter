This testimony is in favor of LD 1634 - An Act to Grant Municipalities the Authority 
to Set Certain Lower Motor Vehicle Speed Limits Without a Department of 
Transportation Speed Study:
As crashes and traffic fatalities increase throughout the United States and Maine, 
speed is one of the greatest factors that can mean the difference between life and 
death. The greater the speed, the greater likelihood a person will be seriously hurt or 
killed in an accident. This is especially true for pedestrians and bicyclists. As we work
toward becoming a state that accommodates all road users, not just vehicles, we can 
reasonably assume that traffic accidents will continue to increase if we don’t start 
making proactive changes. By giving municipalities the authority to set their own 
speed limits without conducting a speed study or going through the MaineDOT, it 
empowers Towns and Cities to make changes for the betterment of their community. 
There’s no doubt in my mind that MaineDOT cares about all road users and they want
to make our roads safer for all. But, they’re only one entity, whose budget is stretched
thin and suffering from the same lack of workforce that is plaquing all industries in 
Maine. Why not lighten the burden and let municipalities make changes that can have 
real positive impact on their communities? These changes are simple, could be 
implemented quickly, and will help improve safety for all.
Thank you,
Matt Pelletier
