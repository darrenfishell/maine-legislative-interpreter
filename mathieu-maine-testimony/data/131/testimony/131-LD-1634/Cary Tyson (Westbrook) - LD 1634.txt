LD 1634
As a citizen of Maine & Westbrook, I urge your support of this bill. LD 1634 
modernizes Maine's outdated & problematic approach to the speed-setting which 
relies on the 85th-percentile rule. Moreover, it empowers local communities to do 
what's right for their town or city. Such options to remove higher-level bureaucracy 
only make sense. 
Thank you for your consideration.
