LD 1634
Dear Sen. Chipman, Rep. Williams, and esteemed members of the Transportation 
Committee,
 
I am testifying in support of LD 1634. I am a resident of Portland, and live on the 
northern edge of town where route 100 transitions from a 40 mph road to a residential
area. I recently had the experience of following along and observing as a developer 
worked through the process of designing a new housing project on city-owned land, 
of which I am an abutter. The project is desperately needed and hits all the key goals 
-- public transportation available, public water and sewer nearby, in a designated 
growth area. It was amazing to me to hear, time and time again, the issue of traffic 
raised in discussions. 
This was clearly a situation where the challenges of traffic control presented a real 
obstacle for both design and public input.  Yet rather than focusing on changing the 
constraint -- i.e. the speed limit along this stretch of road -- the conversations reverted 
back to design changes to react to traffic. The tail wagged the dog.  I am not the 
developer, but it seemed obvious to me that this process could have been smoother if 
those involved had a measure of confidence that the speed limit was a variable that 
could be changed by the city in the interest of the overall good. 
This is a reasonable measure that allows municipalities greater local control without 
mandating that they do so. If a town feels that they do not have expertise to anticipate 
the effects of a change, they can defer to MDOT as they do now. This change would 
empower municipalities and streamline reviews when appropriate.
Please support LD 1634.
Sincerely,
Amy Johnson
