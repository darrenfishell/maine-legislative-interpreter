LD 1634
Please pass LD 1634. Our communities need to be able to set speed limits themselves 
without red tape and bureaucracy getting in the way. Our family lives on a residential 
street in Portland and we regularly have automobile accidents because vehicles are 
traveling far too fast. But our city government is unable to address this issue because 
as the law is currently structured: only the DOT can set speed limits. 
Here are some benefits that this act would create:
Transportation Safety and Choice: Maine people love to
walk and bike, but increasingly people feel unsafe on our
roads. If we want to increase transportation choice, we
must make our roads safer for everyone.
Fiscal health: This bill will lead to slower speeds in areas
where people live and run businesses, increasing real estate
values and retail activity, directly increasing local tax base.
Economic Development: This bill will allow municipalities to
slow vehicle speeds in downtowns and village centers,
where it is critical for people to feel safe and comfortable
walking in order to conveniently and efficiently access
shops and businesses. Data shows slower safer streets
increase retail sales, economic activity, and investment.
Quality of Life: Safe streets are a critical factor for enabling
Mainers to be physically active and socially connected in
their communities.
Climate Action: Slowing traffic in activity centers enables
more people to walk, bike, and roll for day-to-day trips,
which reduces vehicle miles traveled.
Equity: Slower speeds are key to making streets feel safe
and inviting for more people who walk, bike, and use
mobility devices, which is critical for people who lack the
option of driving.
