Senator
Chipman,
Representative
L ynne
W illiams,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
T ransportation:
I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portland’ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
Support
of
LD
1634,
An
Act
to
Grant
Municipalities
the
Authority
to
Set
Certain
Lower
Motor
V ehicle
Speed
Limits
W ithout
a
Department
of
T ransportation
Speed
Study .
This
bill
would
empower
municipalities
to
more
ef fectively
and
quickly
reduce
speed
limits
in
response
to
observed
and
measured
public
safety
issues.
W e
also
request
that
the
Committee
consider
a
minor
amendment
to
the
legislation
to
reduce
the
administrative
burden
at
the
local
level.
While
we
wholeheartedly
support
requiring
public
input
and
a
review
of
safety
deficiencies
prior
to
implementing
any
changes
to
speed
limits,
requiring
that
a
municipality
provide
five
years
of
data
to
the
Legislature
before
and
after
the
change
is
excessive.
As
an
alternative,
we
recommend
requiring
a
one-year
review
and
a
three-year
review
be
conducted
by
the
implementing
municipality
after
implementation,
and
that
these
reviews
include
motor
vehicle
speeds,
pedestrian
counts,
and
bicycle
counts.
W e
believe
that
LD
1634
would
give
municipalities
an
important
tool
to
address
problems
that
they
and
their
residents
are
most
familiar
with.
The
recommended
amendment
will
minimize
the
administrative
burden
of
implementing
those
solutions.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
