LD 1634
Dear Senator Chipman and Representative Williams,
I urge you to vote yes on the proposed legislation, LD 1634. Local control is 
important to Mainers. Our transportation policy has been oriented towards moving 
private vehicles through our towns as fast as possible for far too long. Towns and the 
people who live along these streets should have the right to set their own speed limits.
We all know that speeds regularly exceed posted limits on our streets. We should not 
just reduce the speeds, but we should rethink our entire road infrastructure- shrinking 
lanes, banning lifted trucks that are unsafe at any speed, and enabling other traffic 
calming features like curb bump outs, roundabouts in place of traffic signals, and 
other cost- and environment-saving measures. I urge you to support this bill.
Thank you,
Myles Smith
