Good

Senat or
Chipman,
Repr esentativ e
Williams,
and
honor able
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
T r anspor tation.
My

is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
1634,
“ An
Act

Gr ant

A uthority
t o
Set
Cer tain
Lower
Mot or
V ehicle
Speed
Limits
Without
a
Depar tment

T r anspor tation
Speed
Study . ”
Municipalities
ought
t o
be
able
t o
set
speed
limits
on
their
local
str eets
without
the
time-consuming
pr ocess
of
a
Depar tment
of
T r anspor tation
speed
study
and
without
assuming
r esponsibility
for
the
speed
limits
on
e v er y
single
r oad
in
t own.
Ha ving
the
ability
t o
set
lower
speed
limits
allows
municipalities
t o
r espond
t o
local
tr aﬃc
issues
in
their
business
districts
or
other
congested
ar eas.
Slower
tr aﬃc
in
these
places
mak es
them
mor e
attr activ e
and
comfor table
for
the
people
who
liv e,
work
and
visit
ther e.
This,
in

incr eases
the
potential
for
economic
de v elopment,
not

the
