Hello,
Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to talk to you about creating safer streets. 
Slowing the speeds of our streets,even without a redesign can make walking and 
biking safer. It stands to reason that when cars slow down, buisnesses then have a 
better chance to thrive. 
I've often said to myself that having a business where the speeds are 40+ mph is a 
liability. 
People will visit more places if they simply slow down.
Together with increasing the power that a municipality would gain over setting a 
speed limit in their town without the need of state oversight would go a long way to 
making more prosperous areas in a fraction of the time it would take under the current
model. 
We all understand that moving slower is safer and it's not just for the drivers of the 
automobiles but for the people around them. 
Allowing each municipality to decide for themselves the best speed for any given area
allows for more mixed use zones without the need for any state road studies.
All in all, this one bill could have a revenue generating effect on many municipalities 
that may be struggling in their downtown regions. 
I thank you for your time, 
Don McCann
