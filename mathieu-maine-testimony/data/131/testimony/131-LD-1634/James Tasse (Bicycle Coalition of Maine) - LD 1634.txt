Greetings
Chairs
Chipman
and
W illiams
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
T ransportation:
My
name
is
James
T assé,
and
I
am
the
assistant
director
of
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
(BCM).
Our
mission
is
to
make
Maine
better
and
safer
for
bicycling
and
walking.
On
behalf
of
our
more
than
20,000
members
and
supporters,
I
am
submitting
this
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1634
“An
Act
to
Grant

Authority
to

The
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
is
the
statewide
or ganization
that
advocates
for
bicyclists
and
pedestrians.
W e
work
to
make
Maine
better
for
bicycling
and
walking,
and
to
protect
the
safety
and
rights
of
vulnerable
users
of
the
public
ways.
The
BCM
frequently
hears
complaints
from
Maine
citizens
about
the
threat
posed
by
speeding
traf fic
on
residential
roads
and
downtown
streets.
These
complaints
are
often
driven
by
frustration
that
their
town
will
not
reduce
the
speed
limits,
but
municipalities
in
Maine
have
extremely
limited
authority
to
change
speed
limits.
Even
spot
changes
in
speed
limits
on
local
roads
require
a
MaineDOT
study .
And
because
the
DOT
methodology
emphasizes
85th
percentile
speeds
in
setting
speed
limits,
if
a
study
shows
that
85th
percentile
speeds
exceed
the
posted
limit,
the
posted
speed
limit
may
actually
be
increased.
Like
LD
527,
a
bill
you
considered
just
last
week,
LD
1634
would
return
to
local
government
and
law
enforcement
a
certain
amount
of
authority
to
reduce
speed
limits
on
certain
low
speed
roadways
without
a
formal
MaineDOT
speed
study .
The
roads
in
question
must
be
low
speed
to
begin
with–posted
35mph
or
less–so
that
posted
reductions
will
not
create
hazardous
speed
dif ferentials
between
drivers.
Lowering
the
speed
limit
of
a
road
from
35
to
25
mph,
or
from
30-20
mph,
is
a
modest
adjustment
to
an
already
relatively
low
speed
context.

Roads
eligible
under

would
also
have

be

areas
under
T itle

LD

also
clarifies
that
a
municipality
make
“physical
changes”
to
the
road,
including
traf fic
calming
measures
such
as
speed
tables,
curb
extensions,
and
flex
posts,
to
reinforce
the
lower
speed
limits
on
these
roads.
Most
importantly ,
LD
1634
would
permit
municipalities
to
exercise
this
limited
authority
without
having
to
take
on
the
burden
of
managing
speeds
on
every
road
in
their
jurisdiction.
BCM
believes
that
LD
1634
gives
municipalities
an
appropriately
limited
authority
to
manage
speeding
on
their
roadways
by
permitting
specific,
situational
reduction
of
speed
limits
in
certain
contexts.
It
will
restore
a
measure
of
local
control
to
one
of
a
communities’
most
important
shared
assets:
neighborhood
streets.
BCM
ur ges
an
Ought
to
Pass
vote
on
this
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service
to
the
people
of

Testimony in Support of LD 1634
An Act to Grant Municipalities the Authority to Set Certain Lower
Motor Vehicle Speed Limits Without a Department of
Transportation Speed Study
Greetings Chairs Chipman and Williams and the distinguished members of the 
Committee on Transportation: 
My name is James Tassé,  and I am the assistant director of the Bicycle Coalition of 
Maine (BCM).  Our mission is to make Maine better and safer for bicycling and 
walking.  On behalf of our more than 20,000 members and supporters, I am 
submitting this testimony in support of  LD 1634 “An Act to Grant Municipalities the 
Authority to Set Certain Lower Motor Vehicle Speed Limits Without a Department of
Transportation Speed Study.”   
 
The Bicycle Coalition of Maine is the statewide organization that advocates for 
bicyclists and pedestrians. We work to make Maine better for bicycling and walking, 
and to protect the safety and rights of vulnerable users of the public ways. 
The BCM frequently hears complaints from Maine citizens about the threat posed by 
speeding traffic on residential roads and downtown streets. These complaints are 
often driven by frustration that their town will not reduce the speed limits, but 
municipalities in Maine have extremely limited authority to change speed limits. Even
spot changes in speed limits on local roads require a MaineDOT study. And because 
the DOT methodology emphasizes 85th percentile speeds in setting speed limits, if a 
study shows that 85th percentile speeds exceed the posted limit, the posted speed limit
may actually be increased. 
Like LD 527, a bill you considered just last week, LD 1634 would return to local 
government and law enforcement a certain amount of authority to reduce speed limits 
on certain low speed roadways without a formal MaineDOT speed study.  
The roads in question must be low speed to begin with–posted 35mph or less–so that 
posted reductions will not create hazardous speed differentials between drivers. 
Lowering the speed limit of a road from 35 to 25 mph, or from 30-20 mph, is a 
modest adjustment to an already relatively low speed context. 
Roads eligible under this law would also have to be in designated business, 
residential, or designated growth areas under Title 30-A, section 4301, subsection 
6-C. 
LD 1634 also clarifies that a municipality make “physical changes” to the road, 
including traffic calming measures such as speed tables, curb extensions, and flex 
posts, to reinforce the lower speed limits on these roads.   
Most importantly, LD 1634 would permit municipalities to exercise this limited 
authority without having to take on the burden of managing speeds on every road in 
their jurisdiction.  
BCM believes that LD 1634 gives municipalities an appropriately limited authority to
manage speeding on their roadways by permitting specific, situational reduction of 
speed limits in certain contexts. It will restore a measure of local control to one of a 
communities’ most important shared assets: neighborhood streets. 
 BCM urges an Ought to Pass vote on this bill. 
 
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine.
