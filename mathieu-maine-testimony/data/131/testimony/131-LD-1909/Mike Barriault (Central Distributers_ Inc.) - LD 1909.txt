May 15, 2023 
Good morn1ng 
Senator Brenner, Representatlve Graml1ch and d1st1ngu1shed members of the J o1nt 
Stand1ng Comm1ttee on Env1ronment& Natural Resources My name 1s Mlke 
Barrlault, I am a resident of Auburn and I am the Pres1dent and a 4“‘ generatlon 
family owner of Central D1str1butors 1n Lewiston, a local fam1ly operated beverage 
d1str1butor Our famlly also operates Aroostook Beverage Co 1n Presque Isle We employ approxunately 160 Ma1ne people, about 20 of WhlCh are res1dents of 
Aroostook County I also serve as the v1ce presldent of the Mame Beer & Wme D1str1butors associat1on, and the Ma1ne Beer & W1ne Comm1ngl1ng Group 
We oppose LD 1909 because 1t W111 add s1gn1ﬁcant complexlty and addltlonal 
costs to an already extremely expenslve system Please conslder that Mame already 
Q51 the h1ghest hand11ng fee 1n the country, even before 1t was voted to 1ncrease to 
6 O cents (DOUBLE the cost of any other bottle bill 1n the natlon) Please ﬁnd attached a “Top 10 l1st” (Exhibit A) that 1tem1zes troubhng aspects of th1s b1ll, and 
how 1t would be unfalr for other Mame bus1nesses and consumers 
We support LD 1910 because 1t seeks to make Ma1ne’s bottle b1ll less expens1ve 
by el1m1nat1ng manual brand sort1ng for redemption centers The b1ll does not 
1ntend for the handling fee to be rolled back to 4 5 cents, but 1t does ask fora 
d1scount 1n cons1derat1on of the costs that would be incurred by the part1c1pants to 
manage such a task Please also ﬁnd attached some “Countemomts ” (Exhibit B) that seek to dlspel some very unfalr comparlsons made by NRCM on the b11ls

G1ven the complexlty of these b1l1s and the late hour, we are also 1n support of 
pushlng the 1deas of these two b1lls 1nto the DEP resolve — and would be happy to 
pa1t1c1pate in stakeholder groups I appreclate th1s opportunity to address the 
Commlttee, and would be pleased to walk through the exh1b1ts, particlpate 1n work 
sessron, or respond to any questlons — Thank you, MlkeB
