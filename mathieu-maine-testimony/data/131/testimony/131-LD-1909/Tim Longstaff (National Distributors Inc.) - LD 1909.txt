LD 1909
My company National Distributors Inc in South Portland is a company that has served
Southern Maine for over 55 years and we currently employ 170 team members most 
of these employees have family members that we support. I am  very concerned with 
LD 1909 for many reasons and the effect it will have on our company and our people.
* LD 1909 is just more additional fees and unnecessary regulation that only will drive
our costs higher and prices higher for the Maine consumers. 
* LD 1909 does not eliminate manual sorting.
*LD 1909 it will break a promise that State Legislature made close to 20 years ago 
that allowed local distributors to establish and operate commingling groups.
*LD 1909 will require distributors like ours to pay an additional 1 cent fee, over and 
above the new 6 cent handling fee to a redemption center for any container redeemed 
using a RVM machine. 
* LD 1909 will also require distributors to provide plastic bags to redemption centers, 
something that never worked in the past and was always an issue with abuse the way 
these bags were being used and will discontinued because of this.
