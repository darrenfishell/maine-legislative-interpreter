LD 1909 — An Act to Modernize Maine's Beverage Container Redemption Law and 
LD 1910 — An Act to Amend the Returnable Beverage Container Program 
Testimony of Brian Beneski / DEP

Page 2 of5 
Maine’s Beverage Container Redemption Program (also known as the “Bottle Bill") was 
enacted by a people’s referendum in November of 1976 and was implemented in 
January of 1978 The statutory intent of the program has not changed since its 
enactment in 1976 However, the program is showing its age and needs modernization 
The Department supports the goals of these two bills and many of the means they use 
to achieve them As the changes proposed are significant, I shall briefly try to 
summarize them, and will be prepared to discuss the bills in more detail during the work 
session 
The Department supports the requirement for all initiators of deposit (lODs) to ]Oll'1a 
commingling group, and to establish the Maine Commingling Cooperative 
(“Cooperative ”) This would allow the sorting of containers by material type and size, 
rather than by commingling groups or individual brands Sorting in this manner is 
considered the gold standard of redemption programs and would reduce the number of 
current sorts from over 700 to approximately 30 However, these bills approach the 
administration of new commingling groups differently L D 1909 would allow any entity 
to administer the commingling group, whereas L D 1910 would only allow the 
Cooperative to be the administrator for up to two new groups The Department does 
not believe that only the Cooperative should be allowed to form and administer new 
commingling groups As there are currently two licensed pick-up agents, they should 
also be allowed to administer a new group Allowing the licensed pick-up agents to do 
this would provide a potential for eight commingling groups under the umbrella of the 
Cooperative The Department believes that this is adequate to assure all lODs can find 
a commingling group that fits their individual needs

The Department does not concur w|th the $100 bounty for non-reg|stered products as 
prov|ded |n L D 1909 Th|s bounty system would be compl|cated to adm|n|ster and 
would not slgnlflcantly |mprove the reportmg of unreglstered contalners 
L D 1909 and L D 1910 both pl‘OVldG changes to the current law to address the Issue 
of redempt|on convenlence The Department belleves the best way to address 
redempt|on convenlence IS through settmg a standard of requlrmg the Cooperatlve to 
work towards assunng 90% of Ma|ne’s populatlon |s w|th|n 15 mlles of a redempt|on 
center Th|s IS a s|m||ar standard |n other product stewardshlp programs and |s used for 
Ma|ne’s Pamt Care Program Add|t|onally, changes to the law to clar|fy the relat|onsh|p 
between dealers and redempt|on centers for provldmg redempt|on should also be 
consldered more fully than was addressed by both b|||S, as th|s may also asslst lﬂ 
prov|d|ng redempt|on opportun|t|es 
L D 1909 and L D 1910 both address handllng fees In some manner L D 1909 
conﬁrms the recently passed fee mcrease as provlded by L D 134, whlch has already 
gone |nto effect, and requlres handllng fees to be automat|ca|ly ra|sed as per the 
Consumer Prlce lndex (CPI) L D 1910 proposes lower|ng handllng fees and requmng 
the Cooperatlve to study pOSSlb|6 changes |n handling fees as part of |ts annual report 
The Department does support the current handllng fee but |s not |n support of l|nk|ng the 
handllng fee to the CPI, as th|s would not take mto account any ongo|ng efﬂcnencles that 
may come about through changes |n technology and loglstlcs Requlrlng an analysls of 
the handllng fee and poss|ble adjustment as part of Cooperat|ve ’s annual report would 
be prudent 
L D 1909 and L D 1910 both afford changes to the t|m|ng and amount of contalner 
plCkUp at redempt|on centers The Department does not support the requlrement In 
L D 1909 of redempt|on center puck-ups at least every seven days L D 1910 keeps 
the plCk-Up t|me frame requlrement the same but does add the requlrement of add|t|onal

pickups when redemption centers reach 50,000 containers However, it does not 
specify how much is to be removed during these or any pick-ups To build efficiencies 
in the pick-up system, pick-up agents should continue to have the flexibility to pick up 
every 15 days rather than a shorter time frame However, additional clarification to 
address how much material must be removed at a given pick up should be considered 
If redemption centers are to be picked up by different pick-up agents and there is no 
requirement to “clean out" material, language to address the possible issue of agents 
“cherry picking” the material should be considered 
L D 1909 provides an additional handling fee for redemption centers utilizing 
technology for processing While the Department is in favor of using technology such 
as reverse vending machines, we are not in favor of any additional fees for using any 
sorting technology as this can cause an unlevel playing ﬁeld for redemption centers 
The Department would be supportive of the Cooperative making grants and loans 
available to help make sorting and pickups more efficient 
L D 1909 provides the Department with an annual fee payment of $400,000 for the 
Department's administrative costs L D 1910 does not provide for any additional 
funding to the Department otherthan the current registration fees from labels, lOD’s, 
pick-up agents, and redemption center registrations L D 1909 moves the responsibility 
of label registrations from the Department to the Cooperative, L D 1910 keeps 
Department responsibilities the same The Department concurs with a fee payment 
from the Cooperative to the Department for oversight costs but would increase the fee 
from $400,000 to $500,000 The Department also concurs with the removal of label 
registrations from the Department to the Cooperative The Beverage Container 
Redemption program has been understaffed since it moved from the Department of 
Agriculture in 2015 (when it had seven staff) to the Department, which only has two staff 
members funded by registration fees With the removal of the responsibility of label

registrations, the Department still anticipates four staff members in total to adequately 
oversee the redemption program 
The Department concurs with the support for studying and encouraging the use of 
refillable containers provided in L D 1909 Reﬁllable containers are consistent with 
Maine’s Solid Waste Management Hierarchy and the Department IS supportive of efforts 
to encourage their use 
L D 1909 and L D 1910 provide different uses of the unredeemed deposits, also known 
as escheats Current law allows commingling groups to keep their escheats asa 
reward for commingling, and non-commingling lODs must remit their escheats to Maine 
Revenue Service (MRS) monthly, which are placed in the general fund L D 1909 
allows the commingling groups to keep escheats for costs associated with the 
redemption program and excess remitted to MRS L D 1910 allows forthe 
commingling groups to keep the escheats in their entirety unless the overall redemption 
rate drops below 75%, at which point the state receives the difference between the 
actual rate and 75% The Department has no position on the escheats, other than that 
they would provide a source of revenue for funding the program Uses of escheats for 
anything other than funding the program is best considered by the legislature 
In addition to these items outlined, there are other smaller differences, such as reporting 
requirements, between these bills These issues would be best discussed during the 
work session 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony Scott Wilson and I will be available 
to answer questions of the Committee, both now and at work session
