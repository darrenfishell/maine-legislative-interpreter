As a business owner that relies on local breweries for both local and tourists guests 
adding cost to the brewers crafting these great products would increase our costs as 
well and could be detrimental to the operations of many small Maine breweries that 
attract a lot of people to the state. We ask that the legislature oppose this proposed act 
to modernize Maine's beverage container redemption law.
