Alexander Maffucci
Bar Harbor
LD 1909
Dear ENR Committee,
My name is Alex Maffucci, owner and president of Atlantic Brewing Company in Bar
Harbor.  I write to you to urge you to support LD 1910 over LD 1909.  It is clear that 
the Bottle Bill needs reform to keep beverage containers in a recycling program and 
not on the ground of our beautiful state.  As everyone is aware, costs are rising for 
everyone across the board and the brewing industry in Maine has not been spared.  A 
further cost burden to both brewers and distributors is not a magic bullet to repair the 
redemption system.  Many points need to be addressed to fix this system and I feel 
LD 1910 is the best bill suited to combat the issues.
Thank you for your time
