Testimony of Alison Vanderhoof in Support of LD 1909 
"An Act to Modermze M(aine's Beverage Container Redemption Law” 
Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
May 12, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and DlSlIlﬂgU|Sl'lEd members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources my name is Alison Vanderhoof, I am the out-going CEO of CLYNK, and here 
today to testify in Support of LD 1909 
Hannaford, by law, must be a licensed redemption center at each of its Maine locations At 55 of those locations, 
they have subcontracted CLYNK to provide those redemption center services CLYN K uses a consumer-facing 
process called Bag Drop At unmanned parking lot depots, and bottle rooms within stores, consumers drop off 
bags, made of recycled plastic, that are labeled with a barcoded tag that associates the bag with their online CLYNK 
account Those bags are ﬁlled with mixed beverage containers The bags are scanned-in creating a record that they 
exist within our computer system The containers within the bag are subsequently counted, conﬁrmed to be 
redeemable, and then the deposits are credited to that consumer's online account for future withdrawal When 
the consumer bags are empty, they are recycled, made into things like railroad ties and decking This consumer 
offering is called Bag Drop Despite the fact that 25% of all containers returned in ME today come in through Bag 
Drop, it is not recognized in the current Bottle Bill -— the only methods of returning deposits to consumers that are 
deﬁned in the bill are handcount and reverse vending machines When CLYNK started, the law didn't reﬂect the 
way we wanted to operate, so we have been regulated under the deﬁnition of reverse vending machines (RVM) in 
the law, though we are clearly different
I 
When the parking lot depots reach capacity, often several times each day, the consumers ’ bags are transported toa 
CLYNK processing facility in Oakland or Biddeford The bags are scanned again, conﬁrming receipt in the computer 
system, emptied on a conveyer belt, counted again for the consumer, and then using a highspeed mechanized 
process containers are scanned, and sorted - speciﬁcally for invoicing manufacturers and distributors (lnitiators) 
and returning their containers Like a pickup agent does for a traditional redemption center, CLYNK returns these 
containers in full trailer loads of compact form commodity (crushed 1 ton bales, or large dumpsters of crushed 
glass) which makes the loads very efﬁcient for a recycler buyer to transport away from the state Most of our 
initiator partners do not touch these containers again — they send their chosen commodity buyer straight to the 
CLYNK dock to pick up their material so that they can reap the value of that commodity Again very efﬁcient This 
back end of the Bag Drop Process is called Account-Based-Bulk~Processing or ABBP, and is also not contemplated in 
the current (antiquated) Bottle Bill 
CLYNK was the ﬁrst company in the United States introduce Bag Drop and ABBP We hold several patents and now 
license the capability to other states, and it IS quickly becoming the preferred Redemption Mode across the 
country Last year our Maine facility was operational every day of the year, 22 hours each day, 7 days a week We 
can process about 800K containers daily using our old processes, and 2-3 times that with new processes that we
I 
are innovating We are edging close to 2 billion containers processed in our 17 years in business That s equivalent 
to 24 major league baseball stadiums ﬁlled with containers 
CLYNK's reason for being is to make recycling easier and more rewarding for consumers, while keeping it cost 
efﬁcient for those who pay for these services We have long recognized that high recycling rates depend on the 
participation of all consumers, not ]USlZ die-hard environmentalists, but also know that reaching those reluctant 
consumers gets more and more expensive as they need an increasing level of convenience to draw them in 
As our volume has increased, and we expand our Maine-based company into national markets, we continue to 
explore new technology with the goal of creating a more efficient, and still accurate, approach to account-based 
bulk processing of containers Here we are focused on lowering costs for producers and distributors In orderto
-ECLYNKZ-' 
encourage innovation there needs to be room in the law to test ideas that will lower costs, this room is not there 
today The law also needs to be modernized to reduce the environmental impact, emissions, and cost of 
unnecessary transportation 
The Cooperative proposed in this program is inclusive of the entire industry and that's important for continuous, 
practical improvement that beneﬁts the most participants We should continue to find pathways to reduce costs, 
and appropriately dlocate the containers to the producers CLYNK's data IS invaluable in this process and in 
calculating the overall rate of return 
We agree with the position of others that there should be a pathway to assist Maine's small producers, and we 
believe this bill should help them reduce costs Participating in a commingling group and cooperative should give 
them the combined size required to result in more reasonable pickup fees While we know the handling fee 
increase created deep concern for producers, small producers in Maine report paying a disproportionate share of 
unregulated pickup costs, some citing a total of 16 cents or more per container That can and should be tackled 
with both regulation and/or with the unclaimed deposits, and I encourage the Committee to consider either or 
both 
Among contributions from other Bill participants, LD1909 reﬂects the evolution of our industry and the innovation 
of the 150 Maine-based employees of CLYNK's hard-working team that continues to develop a recycling technology 
company here in our state Recognizing Bag Drop and Account Based Bulk Processing, IS not only the accurate way 
to describe these activities but it will also acknowledge the pride we, and the state of Maine, should have asa 
leader in the country for establishing a strong, in-demand recycling program that I should mention is also 
forward-compatible with EPR, another place where Maine has big goals and a leadership position It is no stretch 
to imagine using your CLYNK account to track any number of recycled materials, and when coupled with our state's 
existing Independent Redemption Center network we have a really compelling practical combination for future 
success 
If this bill passes, CEYNK will work within the Department's guidance to continue the development of efﬁcient and 
accurate container processing for initiators lt’s our goal to demonstrate that we can accurately provide data and 
improve the system so each party involved can ﬁnd beneﬁts I want to thank the Committee and applaud the bill 
sponsors, for the careful consideration contained in this reform bill and l'm happy to answer any questions about 
CLYNK or the redemption process
