Testimony of Rep. Allison Hepler 
presenting 
LD 1909, An Act to Modernize Maine's Beverage Container Redemption Law 
before the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
Good morning, Senator Brenner, Representative Grainlich and members of the Enviromnent and 
Natural Resources Committee I am Allison Hepler and I represent the towns of Arrowsic, 
Georgetown, Phippsburg, West Bath and Woolwich I am pleased to present LD 1909, An Act 
to Modernize Maine's Beverage Container Redemption Law. 
We all got a real education back in March when we heard testimony on the handling fee increase 
for redemption centers I know that as I began to learn about tlns — begimiing last July — from 
constituents, redemption centers, beverage distributors, Natural Resources Council of Mame, 
DEP, Tomra and Clynk, I began to appreciate the history of tlns program, its complexity, as well 
as its popularity Most consumers see the surface of the program — you buy beverages, pay the 
deposit and redeem the contamer This cormmttee knows that there 1S so much more behind the 
scenes, and that’s what today 1S all about I submitted tlns bill because I believe that we can 
modermze and strengthen the current system m a way that sets us up for the future — in 
technology, in enviromnental stewardship, in human resources 
You already know of my interest and why I got involved in the bottle redemption program, soI 
thought I could most usefully spend my time tlns morning walking you through the various 
elements of LD 1909 and the reasons behind all these moving parts I also have some 
suggestions based on what I’ve heard since the bill was printed 
I don’t think I need to say tlns to you at this stage in the session, but we all know that printed 
bills are hopefully a compilation of lots of talking and thmking and collaboration — I know that 
LD 1909 1S — but it’s often not the ﬁnal product that comes out of committee We will hear lots 
of good ideas during tlns Public Hearing and I’d like to go on record as comirntting myself to 
work on what you think are good ideas, combimng these, and presenting something to youm 
time for your Work Session 
First, ui the spirit of reaclnng compromise, I propose that commingling groups, or the beverage 
manufacturers themselves, may keep 50% of the unclanned deposits to help offset their costs of 
District 49 Arrowsic, Georgetown, Phippsburg, West Bath and Woolwich
the program, mstead of the cooperatlve/keepmg 100% as proposed 1n thls b1ll The other half 
W111 be used as proposed 1n LD 1909 to help offset costs of redemptlon centers, encourage the 
use of teclmology, mcrease recycl1ng and reduce waste To be clear, as wrltten, LD 1909 would 
not allow any of the unclalmed to be used for handllng fees or p1ck-up of contamers, but s1nce 
beverage people have been relylng on these ftmds for so long, I feel l1ke half 1s a falr

Page 1 Sec2 
On page 1, there 1s a drfference between 1A and 1B — “Account-based bulk process1ng_pro gram” 
1s the type of processmg operat1on performed by Clynk It 1s not a reverse vend1ng machme l1ke 
we see at some redempt1on centers and at Shaw’s “Bag drop program” also deﬁnes what 
happens at Hannaford w1th Clynk but a “drop and go” program can also be ut1l1zed by any 
redemptlon center Both deﬁmtlons need to be lncluded 
Clynk was a l1fe saver 1n my commtmlty last summer They are a valuable resource 1n our state, 
but 1t’s not for everyone We all know people who survlve off the bottles they collect from the 
s1des of the streets and want the money 1mmed1ately, rather than use Clynk’s account-based 
system And there 1s a small populat1on — I know because I l1ve w1th one — that uses the bottle 
money because he beheves 1t funds h1s soft dnnk habrt 
Also on page l, and at the heart of the b1ll 1s the “Comm1ngl1ng cooperat1ve ” and the 
“Commmghng group ” Reduclng sorts, as you’ve heard from redempt1on centers and from Scott 
Wrlson at DEP 1s the major goal of everyone, and a major commonallty w1th LD 1910 
And th1s 1s done by establ1sh1ng that every busmess that sells beverages 1n contamers w1tha 
deposrt — these are also called Imt1ators of Deposlt” or IoDs — must be part of elther an ex1st1ng 
commmglmg group, or form a new one Exlstmg ones can st1ll work together to share data and 
costs for the1r members Then, all the commlnglmg groups W111 Work together as the cooperatlve 
The cooperatlve W111 functlon as a smgle comm1ngl1ng group so that there can be sortmg only by 
mater1al type and slze, and 1t can facllltate other funct1ons l1ke coord1nat1ng p1ck-up, payment, 
label regrstratlon, reportlng and fac1l1tat1ng more reuse Th1s 1s at the heart of both proposals, and 
key to the success of any modern1zat1on program 1n Mame 
Page 3 Sec 13 “5-A Unreg1stered labels. _pavment ” 
One of the tasks of the commlnghng cooperatlve w1ll be to oversee the label reg1strat1on process 
w1th IoDs Th1s 1s currently done by DEP Taklng over th1s task w1ll allow DEP to focus on 
enforcement and other tasks best left to them 5-A establlshes a “bounty ” When the ﬁrst person 
ﬁnds an unreglstered label — the bottle that gets k1cked out of an RVM or rejected by an alert 
worker at a redemptlon center — 1t gets turned 1n for a $100 reward Every redemptlon center 
confronts tmregrstered contamers on a da1ly bas1s It 1s also common among retallers 
Page 3 Sec 14 “Dealer Acceptance ” (and also consldered on page 16 Sec 34) 
Tlns 1s currently 1n statute, requ1r1ng retall estabhshments to redeem bottles and cans 1f they sell 
these products, unless they’ve made an arrangement w1th a redempt1on center w1th1n 10 m1les 
Here 1s the challenge — a major element 1n the success of bottle b1lls across the natlon 1s 
consmner convemence I struggled to come up w1th an alternatlve 1n terms of determmmg 
D1str1ct 49 Arrowslc, Georgetown, Phlppsburg, West Bath and W0OlW1Ch 4.‘
“convemence, ” maklng sure that there are enough places for consumers to redeem contamers 
across the state Because th1s 1s cr1t1cal We looked at mumclpal “servlce centers” as an 
orgamzrng scheme, and also looked at populatlon by c1ty or by county I’ve spoken W1th the 
retall assoc1at1on about altematlves, because wh1le I thrnk that retall stores could redeem 
contamers 1f they choose to do so, I don’t th1nk 1t should be requlred It’s more lmportant to 
develop a_n equltable d1str1but1on of redemptron centers mstead, and 1f we can, we could remove 
th1s sectlon 1n th1s b1ll Perhaps th1s 1s somethlng we could task the commmglmg cooperatlve 
w1th 
Page 4 and 5 Sec 17 “Relmbursement of handl1ng costs” 
As you leamed 1n March, redemptron centers expenence the same nsmg costs — of labor, of rent 
and ut1l1t1es — as all of us do Unl1ke prrvate bus1nesses, redemptlon centers cannot pass these 
mcreased costs along to the1r customers They are funded by fees pa1d by the IoDs, and those 
fees are set 1n statute Redemptlon centers, as you saw, have had to come to the leglslature to 
request an rncrease What th1s b1ll does 1s t1e future handlmg fee mcreases to the CPI and also 
requrre the cons1derat1on of other cost-related factors 
In March, we also learned that redemptlon centers play an lmportant part 1n our cornmumtles and 
are vrtal to the success of our bottle redemptlon law Not only do they redeem our bottles but 
they also support a large number of non-proﬁt organ1zat1ons that rely on donatlons that come 
from redeemed contamers Many redemptlon centers also tell me that they’d l1ke to keep the 
workers they have, and that means wage mcreases and other beneﬁts 
I wrote an op-ed last Sll1’1'1lTl6I' about the bottle redemptlon cr1s1s happemng 1n my commtmlty, 
and I knew then what I st1ll be11eve now Handl1ng fee 1ncreases alone were never the solut1on, 
but only part of 1t What LD 1909 does 1s that second part 
Page 5 Sec 18 “Obl1gat1on to p1ck up and recycle contamers ” 
Thls guarantees more frequent p1ckups at redemptlon centers and mcludes 1ncent1ves to do th1s 
Many redempt1on centers have told me that even W1th regular p1ckups, they st1ll have products 
that must be left belnnd It’s a common frustratron Wrth the end of brand sort1ng, the 
cooperatlve can better and more efﬁcrently organ1ze these p1ck-ups, reducmg truckmg mlleage 
and fees 
Page 6 Sec 19 “Plast1c bagg, receptacles ” 
Redemptlon centers used to recerve those large plast1c bags and contamers for free and at some 
pomt, tlns changed Tlns b1ll restores that pract1ce and would be funded by the uncla1med 
depos1ts 
Page 7 Sec 25 “Speclal comrmnghng agreement ” 
Th1s sectlon ensures that there W111 not be a p1ck-up agent monopoly do1ng p1ck-ups from all 
redemptron centers 
Pages 8-13 Sec 27 “3 -B Commmgl1ng_program operated by commmglmg cooperat1ve ” 
Th1s sectlon estabhshes the process of settmg up the commmglmg program operated by the 
cooperatlve that I deﬁned earlrer 
D1str1ct 49 Arrowslc, Georgetown, Phlppsburg, West Bath and Woolwlch
It 1s m th1s section that you see the types of ad1n1mstrat1ve work that the cooperatlve would 
undertake fonn a non-proﬁt w1th a board compnsed of all stakeholders, develop a sultable 
method of 1fI'aI1S1'[l0I ‘1 from brand to matenal type, determ1ne a fa1r apport1omnent of costs, 
collect1ons and p1ck up schedules, create a searchable database of reglstered contamers, prov1de 
reports, recommendat1ons, and conduct educatlon and outreach One key respons1b1l1ty 1s to 
develop a standardlzed method for establ1sh1ng a rate of redempt1on Under th1s program, the 
program could also contlnue to collect brand level data obtamed by the accotmt-based processors 
or RVMs as long as they pay for the cost of that data Th1s program also acknowledges that each 
comm1ngler and IoD ma1nta1ns ownerslnp of the processed and recycled matenal and beneﬁts 
from the sale of the matenal 
Speclﬁcally, on page 9, number 5, one of the cooperat1ve ’s respons1b1l1t1es 1s to develop a plan 
that protects small beverage compames from 1ncurr1ng costs of handllng fees for contalners that 
are not redeemed One of the b1g 1ssues I’ve learned 1s that how the d1str1butors charge smaller 
beverage compames for bottle b1l1 related costs 1s varled and currently unregulated LD 1909 
would prov1de for more transparency and ensures that smaller compames aren’t charged for costs 
of handllng conta1ners that were never redeemed Furthermore, under the prov1s1ons of LD 1909, 
the cooperatlve W111 need to get approval from DEP regardmg tlus and other procedures 
Sectlon 27, m other words, 1s what the cooperatlve would do There 1s lots of overlap w1th 
Sectlon 31, wh1ch 1s also what the cooperat1ve w1l1 do but also how 1t 1s pa1d for 
Pages 14-15 Sec 31 “Uncla1med depos1ts ” 
Th1s 1s where LD 1910 and th1s b11l ﬁmdamentally d1verge I spent a lot of t1me over the last 
several months w1th the d1str1butors to ﬁnesse the lssue of “uncla1med depos1ts ” Currently, 
d1str1butors 1n comm1ngl1ng groups keep the tmclalmed depos1ts — the mckel that a consumer 
does not get back when they don’t tum 1n the1r bottle The amount of comm1ngled uncla1med 1s 
at least $7 3 m1ll1on The exact total 1sn’t clear to me and 1s a great quest1on for DEP For non- 
conmnnglers, those mckels get sent to the General Fund on a monthly basls, and that amount 1s 
about $3 5 m1ll10n The ownershlp of unredeemed mckels was last establlshed 1n 2004 It wasa 
“reward” of sorts m exchange for agreelng to comm1ngle 
LD 1909 states that the ownersh1p of the uncla1med would l1e w1th the cooperat1ve As 
mentroned at the beg1nnmg of my testlmony, I a1n propos1ng to retum half to the d1str1butors and 
manufacturers Th1s 1s a large amount of money that these establlshed buslnesses are accustomed 
to keepmg 
I was not remotely concemed w1th th1s lssue 1n 2004 when d1str1butors started to keep the 
uncla1med depos1ts Twenty years later, I have thought about th1s a lot and I ﬁlndamentally 
be11eve that th1s 1s money that belongs to the pubhc That sa1d, I am not happy w1th consumers 
who choose not to redeem thelr conta1ners, but the vast ma1or1ty of us pay our mckels because 
we care about our env1romnent, regardless of whether we get that n1ckel back 
I talked w1th many people last year who were frustrated w1th the wldespread closure of 
redempt1on centers and s1mply popped the1r redeemable bottles and cans 1nto the1r other 
D1str1ct 49 Arrowslc, Georgetown, Phlppsburg, West Bath and W0OlWlCh im,
recyclrng But they st1ll cared a lot about tlns program, and many were surprrsed to learn where 
the unclarmed currently goes In truth, most beheved that 1t went to the State to ftmd th1s 
program 
Under LD 1909, as you can see 1n th1s Sectlon, uncla1med depos1ts would pay for the costs of the 
cooperat1ve ’s ad1n1n1strat1on of the program, 1nclud1ng any necessary stafﬁng for the 
cooperatrve A spec1ﬁc correctlon to page 14, Part B (lme 20) 1s that “may” should be “shall” 
That “bounty” I mentroned earlrer‘? The cooperat1ve ’s ftmds would take care of that payment 
whrle also gomg after the busrness that 1s selhng the unregrstered label The unclarmed would 
also be used to pay an annual fee to DEP Remember, w1th the cooperatrve taklng over the 
regrstratron and label1ng, DEP has no 1ncome, other than the annual fees pald by the redempt1on 
center 
Uncla1med funds under LD 1909 would also be used to pay redemptron centers an add1t1onal 1 
cent to 1ncent1v1ze 1nvestments 1n teclmology such as reverse vend1ng machmes (Th1s 1s also 
spelled out on page 10. number 8. under Sec 27 ) I am concerned that once there 1s no more 
requ1red brand sortrng, redempt1on centers mlght be d1s1ncent1v1zed to use RVMs But RVMs 
help gather 1mportant data, reduce storage space and crush the conta1ners so that there are fewer 
trucks on the road “truckmg a1r” 
Uncla1med ﬁmds would also be used to pay any handllng fees 1n excess of the current 6 cent 
handl1ng fee, should 1t 1ncrease 1n the future Thrs would provrde stab1l1ty 
Also, 1n llght of rncreased publ1c lnterest 1n “reduce, reuse and recycle, ” th1s money should be 
used to conduct a market analysrs of a reﬁllable beverage contamer program 1n Ma1ne Th1s and 
other act1v1t1es would be almed at aclnevlng and ma1nta1mng an 85% redempt1on rate, among the 
hlghest 1n the natlon 
After mak1ng these rnvestments 1n ensunng a hrgh redempt1on rate, ma1nta1mng conven1ence and 
educatronal matenals for consumers and tour1sts ahke, prov1d1ng equ1ty and susta1nab1l1ty and 
pred1ctab1l1ty for redempt1on centers, helplng small beverage compames successfully ut1l1ze th1s 
program, and promotlng contmued 1rmovat1on1n our envlromnent, the remalnder of the 
tmcla1med w1ll go back to the General Fund We all beneﬁt from a successful bottle redempt1on 
program 
As I sa1d at the outset, I’ve been commrtted to successfully overhaulmg th1s program that I care 
deeply about, and I know that many others share my opt1m1sm 
Thanks for your trme, and I’m happy to answer any questlons you have
