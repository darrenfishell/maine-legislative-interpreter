RE Comments on LD 1909, An Act to Modermze Maine's Beverage Container Redemption Law, and LD 
1910, An Act to Amend the Returnable Beverage Container Program 
Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee 
My name IS Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO of the Retail Association of Maine lama 
resident of Topsham We have more than 350 members statewide and represent retailers of all sizes 
Maine's retailers employ more than 85,000 Mainers We are here today to provide comment and input 
on two proposals to change Maine's beverage container law 
We are aware of the stress that Maine's beverage redemption program has been under, and know that 
the reasons for that are not simple or for a singular reason We met with Scott Wilson and other folks 
from the Maine DEP last year to talk about the issue, and try to understand the challenges and possible 
solutions 
We agree that Maine's beverage redemption program needs changes, and that simply providing more 
money for the program Wlll not solve the major problems One of the important changes is to simplify 
the hundreds of bottle sorts to a more manageable system that focuses more of that container material 
like glass, aluminum, and plastic Between LD 1909, and LD 1910, we do not have the knowledge or 
experience to say which method would best achieve that, or if there is some amalgam of the two 
Regardless, we are supportive of a simplified sorting system which seems to be one of the major pieces 
ofany reform 
We do have one specific concern with a provision in LD 1909, Representative Hepler’s bill We have 
spoken with her, and she seemed open to changes to that section Sec 14 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§1 of 
the bill proposes changes to the existing agreement dealers (which would be retailers) have with 
redemption centers As we understand it, these changes were proposed to try to address areas where 
there may not be a redemption center As drafted, the changes proposed in this section are not 
workable 
We have looked at the map of current redemption centers, and we are hoping that data could be 
overlaid with population concentrations, and with existing local transfer stations By looking at all three 
data points, we think that could help identify where gaps may exist, and how many gaps we maybe
l 
dealmg w|th We thlnk spec|f|c areas that do not have avallable redempt|on centers can be addressed |n 
a drfferent way One of the cons1derat|ons should be whether area transfer stations can be a possrble 
solutnon to these gaps |n coverage 
We have slgmﬁcant concerns w|th proposals that would requ|re any retailers that sell beverages 
(regardless of how small those sales may be) to accept beverage contamers when they are not m the 
buslness of domg so Retallers have very llmlted storage, and are not ll"l the posltlon of belng reverse 
retallers LD 1910 makes a nod to thls dlscussron by statmg, ”Engage w|th retallers to ensure a balance 
between retall redempt|on and alternatnves " We are happy to cont|nue workmg w|th b|ll sponsors and 
other stakeholder to try to ﬁnd alternatlves 
In closmg, we are SUppOl"tlVE of ongo|ng stakeholder dISCUSSlO ﬂS of lmprovements to the bottle blll We 
know |t IS not llkeily that all the Issues can be adequately addressed |n LD 1909, and LD 1910 We are 
happy to partlclpate |n any process th|s comlng year 
Thank you for the opportunlty to share our thoughts 
S|ncerely,
