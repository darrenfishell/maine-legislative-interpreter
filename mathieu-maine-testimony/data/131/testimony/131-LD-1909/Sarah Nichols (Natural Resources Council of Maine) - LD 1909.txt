Senator Brenner, Representatlve Gramhch, and members of the Jolnt Standmg Commlttee on 
Envlromnent and Natural Resources, my name 1s Sarah N1ChOlS, and I am the Sustamable Mame 
Director for the Natural Resources Counc1l of Mame (NRCM) I appreclate th1s opportumty to 
testlfy m strong support of LD 1909, An Act to Modermze Mame’s Beverage Contamer 
Redemptlon Law We also are test1fymg 1n oppos1t1on to LD 1910 
Over the past 45 years, Ma1ne’s Bottle B111 program has been extremely effectlve at reducmg 
lltter, lncreasmg recychng, creating _]ObS, fundmg chantles, and reducmg costs for mumc1pal1t1es 
and taxpayers The Bottle B111 1s a cntlcal foundatlon for Ma1ne’s recycllng culture and remams 
as lmportant and relevant as ever Mame people are proud of the Bottle B111, and we should be 
When the beverage industry attempted to roll back the Bottle B111 1n a referendum 1n 1976, 
Mame voters I‘6_]CC1l6d that effort by a margln of 6 to 1 Addltlonal efforts to weaken the law have 
been re] ected over the years Thls Committee has conslstently defended the Bottle B111, voted to 
expand 1t wlth addltlonal 1l;6II1S, such as mps, and most recently you helped stab1l1ze fu.nd1ng for 
redemptlon centers by passmg LD 134 We thank you for that work, and now we ask you to help 
pass LD 1909, Wl'llCh W111 streamlme and strengthen the program so that 1t remams successful for 
the future 
LD 1909 W111 address three key aspects of Ma1ne’s Bottle B111 that require attentlon 
1) Strengthens Redemption Center Finances: A statlc, statutorily set handlmg fee does 
not protect redemptlon centers agamst future 1ncreases m rent, ut1l1t1es, and labor costs, 
wh1ch threatens the susta1nab1l1ty of thelr buslnesses LD 134 has helped bnng them up to 
where they need to be today, but ﬁlrther long-term solutlons are proposed m LD 1909, 
2) Simpliﬁes the system: The sortlng, collectlon, and blllmg processes have become overly 
burdensome and comphcated, m large part because of the number of new beverage 
compames and types of beverages brought to market s1nce 1976 LD 1909 would bnng 
slgmﬁcant new efﬁc1enc1es to the program, and 
3) Supports the use of technology: The b1llprov1des fmanclal mcentlves for redemption 
centers to use reverse vendmg machmes and acknowledges the exlstence of CLYNK’s 
bulk processmg technology Both technologles provlde economlc and envlromnental 
beneﬁts
In contrast, LD 1910 pnmanly addresses the lssue of s1mpl1ﬁed sortmg, but 1t does 1t m a way 
that’s deslgned to maxlmlze beneﬁts for large beverage manufacturers LD 1910 would threaten 
the v1ab1l1ty of Mame’s redemptlon centers and provlde l1ttle mcentlve for the use of technology 
Both blllS propose the estabhshment of a new comrnmglmg cooperat1ve that would help 
admrmster the program wlth the Department of Envrronmental Protection Attached to my 
testlmony 1s a s1de-by-s1de companson of the two b1lls 
NRCM strongly recommends the approach presented m LD 1909 for the followmg reasons 
0 Better approach to the handling fee: LD 1909 lmproves the ﬁnances of redemption 
centers by adjustmg the handlmg fee for 1nﬂat1on, and 1t protects the beverage mdustry 
from the ﬁnanclal burden of any future lncreases by allowmg them to ut1l1ze the 
unclarmed deposrts to offset any future lncreases m the handlmg fee LD 1910 would 
undo the good work of LD 134 and reduce the handlmg fee back to where 1t was, whrch 
would threaten the v1ab1l1ty of Mame’s redemptlon centers, agaln 
0 More equitable use of unclaimed deposits: LD 1909 requlres the unclalmed consumer 
funds to be relnvested back mto the program 1n a way that helps everyone mvolved to 
offset the1r costs LD 1910 srmply perpetuates the current system of provldmg these 
funds as tax-ﬁee lncome for beverage manufacturers 
0 Ensures investments in recycling and reuse systems LD 1909 requlres the new 
cooperatrve to use a portlon of the uncla1med deposrts to mvest 1n act1v1t1es that reduce 
waste and lead to more reﬁll and reuse of contamers and to support the use of technology 
that provrdes econom1c and environmental beneﬁts for the program LD 1910 squanders 
th1s opportimrty because 1t falls to mclude th1s requrrement 
0 Providing equal standing for all players: LD 1909 ensures that CLYNK’s bulk 
processmg technology 1s recogmzed, that small beverage manufacturers only pay thelr 
falr share of costs, redemptlon centers recelve p1ck-ups as frequently as needed, and they 
are pald promptly for the work that they do keep th1s program runmng smoothly The 
new cooperative would also have a board of drrectors that represents all stakeholders m 
the Bottle B111 LD 1910 lncludes none of these prov1s1ons 
Thank you for oonslderatlon of my comments, and thank you for your efforts to ensure that 
Ma1ne’s most successful recyclmg program contmues to beneﬁt Mame’s people and the 
envlronment well mto the future I would be glad to answer any questrons you may have
