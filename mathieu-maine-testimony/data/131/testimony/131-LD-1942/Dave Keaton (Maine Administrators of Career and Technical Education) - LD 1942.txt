TESTIMONY REGARDING 
L.D. 1942 
An Act to Ensure Equity in Career and Technical Education Staffing Support 
Ratios Across Varied Regions of the State 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee. I am Dave Keaton, Executive Director of Maine 
Administrators of Career & Technical Education, testifying on behalf of the CTE 
Directors of the Maine Administrators of Career & Technical Education (MACTE). 
MACTE would like to address LD 1942 as we are in support of this bill. 
This bill allows schools with fewer than 1,000 students to have one full-time 
instructor for career and technical education for every 8 students and schools 
with 1,000 or more students to have one full-time instructor for career and 
technical education for every 13 students or a ratio appropriate to the industry 
standard for the career field that is the program of the career and technical 
education. 
CTE Directors are encouraged by this bill as it would enable smaller Maine CTEs the 
stability of maintaining full time CTE programs even if their enrollment numbers slips 
below 13:1 ratio. For smaller CTEs that have a catchment area of smaller high 
schools, a 13:1 for smaller CTEs was identified as a CTE barrier in the recent LD 313 
report provided to this committee by the Maine Department of Education. 
This ratio is very challenging for particular programs such as: 
1. Certified Nursing Programs. Especially in the clinical setting 
2. Commercial Driving Licensing programs 
3. Forestry Programs 
We would like to recommend that bill read, ”fewer than 1,000 students, in the CTE 
Center/Region's catchment area” with the same for, ”with 1,000 or more students in 
the CTE Center/Region's catchment area”.
We look forward to discussing this matter with ali of you in a future work session 
Yours in education, 
Thwe ‘Keaton 
Dave Keaton, IVIACTE Executive Director
