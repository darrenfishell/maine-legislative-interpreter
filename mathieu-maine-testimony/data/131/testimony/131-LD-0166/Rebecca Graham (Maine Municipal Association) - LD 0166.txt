Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association
Neither For Nor Against
LD 166 – An Act to Provide Revenue for Property Tax Relief and Capital Infrastructure Projects
January 31, 2023
_________________________________________________________________________________
Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, and distinguished members of the State and Local Government 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I am submitting placeholder testimony neither for nor 
against, LD 166, An Act to Provide Revenue for Property Tax Relief and Capital Infrastructure Projects, 
on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association, which represents the interests of municipal government 
before the Legislature. 
The positions of the Association are established by our 70-member Legislative Policy Committee 
(LPC), who are elected by the councils and selectboards of municipalities in each of Maine’s 35 Senate 
districts who have not had the opportunity to review this bill language and take an official position. 
Generally, municipalities appreciate flexibility in revenue expenditure that allow for creative 
responses to locally acute issues. If the committee has not voted this legislative proposal out before our 
LPC takes a formal position, I will submit additional testimony at that time. As always, I am available to 
answer any additional questions you may have at any time via email at rgraham@memun.org or 207-624-
0101.
