Capital Infrastructure Projects”
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on State and Local Government, I am Senator Jill Duson and I serve Senate District 27, which 
includes parts of Westbrook and Portland. I support LD 166, “An Act to Provide Revenue for 
Property Tax Relief and Capital Infrastructure Projects” which will allow municipalities to 
allocate the revenue collected from parking meters towards improving the infrastructure in their 
communities.
Expanding the flexibility in how parking meter revenue is allocated would empower 
municipalites to improve their communities. Broadening the scope of the legislation to the term 
“infrastructure” allows local governments to further serve their constituents by being able to 
match the funding they allocate to the needs of their residents. No one knows better than the 
municipalities what their immediate needs are. 
Additionally, this bill proposes to allocate the funds towards property tax relief. With the 
increase of property taxes this past year, many families are struggling. The use of these funds 
towards those tax relief programs would help families statewide, in an issue that is not limited to 
the urban centers in Maine. 
I urge you to support LD 166 and I thank you for your consideration.
