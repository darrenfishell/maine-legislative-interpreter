I am writing to you concerning LD-697/HP 466, “Resolve, to Study the Effects of 5G 
Technology on Bird, Bee and Insect Populations and the Effects of Long-term 
Exposure on Children.”
I understand that this bill is targeting 5G technology; however, the wording in the text
is very similar to other state’s efforts to regulate 5G but unintentional, or not, ended 
up entangling the Amateur Radio Service as well. Maine recently issued a joint state 
legislative resolution recognizing the valuable contributions of the state’s 
approximately 4,500 FCC-licensed amateur (ham) radio operators and all the 
contributions they routinely make to Maine’s communities and to the state as a whole.
Directing the University of Maine System to investigate the effects of “radio 
frequency emissions at thermal levels and pulsed and modulated radio frequency 
radiation at nonthermal levels for extended periods of time on children in educational 
settings,” as the bill states, could accidentally include amateur radio within its 
purview, and included in any resulting future legislation. The FCC already requires 
licensed amateur radio operators to conduct RF exposure surveys of their ham radio 
stations and antenna systems.
Please keep this in mind and if any related bills or action is taken, please ensure there 
is an exemption for the Amateur Radio Service.
Thank you for your consideration, and for your service to the State of Maine.
Sincerely,
Karl Richards K1KSR
