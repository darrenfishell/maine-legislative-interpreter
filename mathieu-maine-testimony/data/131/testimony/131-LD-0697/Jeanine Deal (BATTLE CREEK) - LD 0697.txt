Dear Members of the MA Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee,
Michigan State Representative James DeSana has recently announced his intention to 
introduce legislation prohibiting transmission antennas and equipment on school 
property.  While his proposed setback of 100 yards is not nearly enough to protect the 
children and staff, per numerous studies conducted, I wanted to let you know of his 
announcement.
If you would like to contact MI Rep. James DeSana...
Email:  JamesDeSana@house.mi.gov
Phone: (517) 373-0475
Thank you for your attention to this very important issue!
Sincerely,
Jeanine Deal
Founder, Michigan for Safe Technology
