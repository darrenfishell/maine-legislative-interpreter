Testimony in opposition of H.P. 466/LD-697 – RESOLVE TO STUDY THE 
EFFECTS OF 5G TECHNOLOGY ON BIRD, BEE, AND INSECT POPULATIONS
AND THE EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM EXPOSURE ON CHILDREN
SUBMITTED BY: Randi Bolen, of Milbridge, Maine.
I strongly oppose this bill as worded.  I have lived with my grandparents most of my 
21 years and they are both amateur radio operators who have always used “radio 
frequency emissions” to communicate with people throughout Maine and the world. I 
have never felt any ill effects from these rf emissions.
Also, I have grown up with WIFI, 3G and now the newest 5G technology and have 
never felt any negative effects or felt unsafe using this technology. This bill seems to 
come from speculation instead of science. No legislative action should be taken 
regarding this bill unless a lot of solid scientific facts are presented.
Additionally, without RF emissions, we would have no police, fire, ambulance 
communications or other dispatch services. If any legislation results from LD-697, 
please make sure public safety and the amateur radio service are exempt.
