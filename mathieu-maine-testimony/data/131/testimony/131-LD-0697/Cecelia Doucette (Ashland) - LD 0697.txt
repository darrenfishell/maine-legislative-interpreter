H.P. 466 Resolve, to Study the Effects of 5G Technology on Bird, Bee and Insect 
Population and the Effects of Long -term Exposure on Children  
March 2, 2023  
Dear Energy, Utilities an d Technology C hair Lawrence and Esteemed Members,  
Thank you for your careful c onsideration of this bill to investigate  the bio logica l effects of 5G 
technology on our environment  and our children.  
Like some of you , perhaps, I had no idea  there was an ything to be concerned with until an 
electrical engineer friend of mine tipped me off there were harm ful ef fects.  
I am a technical and professional writer by trade, so I wondered if there was any science to back 
up that claim. I was astoun ded to find, literally , thousands of peer -reviewed studies all across 
the world showing ser ious damage to children, adults , flora and fauna – all biological cells are  
impacted . 
In 2014 I helped Ashland, MA public schools become the  first in the nation  to begin t aking 
precautionary measures.  I then worked with Massachusetts Senate President Karen Spilka to 
introduce legislation to investigate. I helped NH pass the first law in the nation to d o a truly 
independent investigation and they have issued a  groundbreaking report  documenting conflicts 
of interest with the wireless in dustry, the FCC and the FDA.   
NH makes 15 recommendations to educate the public and begin transitioning our communities 
away from wireless radiation emissions to far superior connectivity via fiber -optics to and 
through the premises (FTTP).  This will be a good roadmap fo r Maine to follow, provide you do 
not let corruption seep in like it did in Oregon.  
I have also helped to establish the international non -profit Wireless Education  where we can 
literally train M aine constituents, schools and workforces on wireless risks and medically 
recommended best practices for safer technology use – in about a half hour on -line.  Please let 
me know if I can grant you complimentary access to the Schools & Families Course.  
A Quick Skim of the Facts  
I had a hard time keeping the data straight when I first st arted investigating so I created a very 
simple research reposit ory that I called Understanding EMFs because I d id not understand what 
these invisible elect romagnetic fields (EMFs) of microwave radiofrequency radiation could be 
doing to us and our planet . 
In the following pages I will include my findings that pertain  directly  to this bill  and you will be 
able to quickly sk im the facts and drill down into th ose that interest you :  
• Planetary Impact  
Maine H.P.466  Cece lia Doucette  Page 2 of 50 
 • Impact on Children  
• Wi-Fi in School s 
Please know, t he wireless industry and their parent companies own mu ch of today ’s major 
broadcast networks , print media  and other mainstream outlets . So the general public , local 
public servants and most legislators  are only given their messaging and  do not have a balance of 
information to be able to mak e safe and responsible choices  on how they connect to 
technology .  
Be Careful Where You Get Your Information  
As a Harvard Law School Center for Ethics report  confirms , the Federal Communications 
Commission is dominated by the industries it presumably regulates.   
Many  state s are already taking action an d so at the end of this document  I will also provide you 
with a sampling of bills introduced around the country . 
Having participated in legislative hearings on this issue, we have seen time and a gain industry 
lobbyists deny the science and harm , and provide disinformation to the legislators.  
Please , as the Italian courts  did, look only at the non -industry funded pee r-reviewed science an d 
the truth will be crystal  clear : wireless  radiation from any source  is a n eurotoxin, 
immunosuppre ssant , carcinogen  and a  genotoxin and it is steadily  ruining  our children, bir ds, 
bees and other flora and fauna . Fiber -to-and-through -the-premises (FTTTP) is the answer.  
Let's Learn  Together  
I invite you, your colleagues, loved ones and constituents  to join us for two free webinars  I am 
co-hosting each month to teach the basics of the science, risks, legal actions, public poli cy 
inroads and most importantly, steps we can all take TODAY to greatly reduce our radiation 
exposures while enjoying excellent connectivity : https://www.ma4safetech.org /events . 
I would be honored to help you connect the dots  further on this critical public and 
environmental health issue. Th e Maryland State Children’s Environmental Health and Protection 
Advisory Council (CEHPAC) in December 2022 released an  informational factsheet  on how to 
reduce children’s wireless exposures entitle d “Guidelines to Reduce Electromagnetic Field 
Radiatio n”.   
I sincerely hope you will bypass industry persuasions and resolve to  protect the children of 
Maine  too. Here's a challenge: can you find the legal fine print disclaimer in your phone that has 
been in there all along telling you to keep it way from your body? I'd be honored  to walk you 
through w here to find it.  
 
Respectfully,

▪ The Center for Energy Efficient Telecommunica tions Report, "The Power of Wireless 
Cloud”  
This Australian study found that  wireless networking infrastructure worldwide 
accounts for significantly more power consumption than data center s. They 
calculated that wireless cloud access will generate as much planet -harming CO2 as 
4.9 million cars by 2015. It consumes far more energy to keep streaming or 
downloading and uploading files wirelessly than it does to carry the same files 
around and access them from the local device .

United States  
A study on the grow ing energy impact of Internet video streaming found data 
transmission is the most energy -intensive part of streaming movies. This report was 
published in Environmental Research Letters. The authors state that results from this 
study indicate that designers  and policy makers should focus on the efficiency of end -
user devices and network transmission energy to curb future increases in energy use 
from the proliferation of video streaming .  
 
▪ More Data, Less Energy Making Network Standby More Efficient in Billions of

Maine H.P.466  Cece lia Doucette  Page 6 of 50 
 In July 2014, the International Energy Agency released their Report calling for better 
standards on the energy devices use when they are on standby. This report details 
the problem of electronic devices drawing as much power in standby mode as they 
do when  activated. Consumers who own these devices often only use them for a 
short time every day, but they continue to use power so they can boot up an internet 
connection in a few seconds . 
 
▪ This article from the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE) indicates, 
"Wireless technologies will continue to  consume at least 10 times more powe r than 
wired technologies when providing comparable access rates and traffic volumes." 
See page 7 of 8, just above Conclusions, which indicate hard wiring with fi ber-optics 
to the premises is the most energy efficient solution .

Two  child p sychologist s have written excellent books on what wi -fi and screen time are 
doing to our children and our families:   
 
▪ Dr. Catherine Steiner -Adair offer s The Big Disconnect , which takes one through 
technology’s impact at each stage of child development. Basically, the left side of the 
brain where math and science are housed is still developing on point. The right side, 
however, is not in many children. This is where a child’s ability to show empathy, 
employ coping strategies, make eye contact, and self -sooth are housed. In humans, 
we need regular human contact and deep meaningful interactions with loved ones 
and teachers to develop these properly. Children also need unstructured time for 
imaginative play to develop deep parts of our brains. Although well -intended 
parents think providing their children with technology will give them a leg up, the 
research is proving otherwise as we be gin to see scores dropping after upping 
technology time, and behavioral and mental health issues are escalating . 
 
▪ In Reset Your Child’sBrain , Dr. Victoria Dunkle y explains the myriad ways in which 
children can be harmed by electronic screen syndrome (ESS). Biologically, electronic 
screen exposure can cause a chronic fight or flight response, and hit the same opiate 
receptors in the brain as drugs and alcohol causing  addiction. Children with 
attention issues and those with autism are at higher risk of addiction. If not given 
appropriate time to rest and regenerate, children begin to suffer chronically. 
Common symptoms are irritability, depression and mood swings. As E SS progresses, 
mood disregulation may combine with aggression causing some to be diagnosed 
with bi -polar disease. Others may develop obsessive -compulsive behavior, 
nightmares, panic attacks, tics, seizures, etc., as the effects take hold on the brain. 
Dr. Dunkley demonstrates how freedom from electronic screens can change the 
brain and alleviate or significantly reduce many of these symptoms. She offers a 
four -week plan to reverse the effects of ESS. See also her article i n Psychology 
Today .

 Overview  
▪ Urgency:  The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Educational Technology  is 
piloting  six School District Wireless Network Models  that expose children and staff 
directly to close -range cell tower radiation and toxic radiation from wireless devices 
issued to students.  The science below indicates great harm to children. Much better 
technology can be had by turning away the wireless industry and securing excellent 
technology with hard -wired fiber -optic connections to and through the premises.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmcAXZ -o1K4  
Please note, the United States' current  FCC standards  for EMFs are very similar to 
Australia's outdat ed standards and are currently under formal review.   However, in 
the cases of smoking, asbestos and lead, it took many years for the our government 
to change our public health standards so we may not see change come from the top 
anytime soon.   In the meant ime, manufacturers will continue to sell us harmful 
products so it is up to concerned citizens to protect themselves and their loved ones.

▪ Los Angeles Unified School District  has lowered its radiation exposure to 10,000 
lower than the FCC limit, however, science indicates this is still not a biologicall y safe 
level and gives a false sense of security:  
http://www.lausd -
oehs.org/docs/Misc/Radiofrequency_Safety_Fact_Sheet_021113a.pdf  
 
▪ Scientists from around the world submitted an  International Appeal  to the World 
Health Organization and United Nations  in 2015 imploring them to protect 
especially our children and pregnant women, but to date, nothing has been 
done.   The documentary, " Microwaves, Science and Lies ," shows evidence that even 
the WHO may be influenced by manufacturers' profit agendas.    
 
▪ Parents around the world are becoming educated and working with their school 
board s to remove and/or limit wi -fi exposure. Unfortunately, most schools boards 
and technology directors only know what the FCC tells them, which is that there is 
no evidence of biological harm at the non -thermal level.   Science has long since 
proven this is n ot true. Please  see the  Science  page  for details.   
 
▪ There is great potential harm at the non -thermal, non -ionizing level, but 
our FCC guidelines remain in place from 1996 and that is what those who are 
resistant to change will defer to. If you read the guidelines, you will see engineers, 
not biologists, set them.   Among them were members of the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers, Inc. ( IEEE ).  There is hope though, as in March 2016, the 
IEEE acknowledged biological effects in the  IEEE Power Electronics Magazine  article, 
"Some Effects of Weak Magnetic Fields on Biological Systems: RF fields can change 
radical concentrations and cancer cell growth rates ." 
 
▪ Until a higher authority tells our schools to remove the wi -fi and use hard -wired 
connections, most school boards may not feel empowered enough to make the 
change.   Ultimately, technology should not be rolled out until it is proven biologically 
safe but th at did not happen with wireless and cellular products.   Harvard 
Maine H.P.466  Cece lia Doucette  Page 22 of 50 
 University's  Captured Agency  report explains how the telecommunications industry 
rolled out p roducts without proper safety testing.  
So, until actual safe technology can be brought to market,  it is up to the parents to 
become educated , and then help educate our schools to protect our children and 
staff members.  
Students Taking Action

towards an improper use." So, that is what industry subsequently did. They renamed 
"laptops" to "tablets" but didn't inform the public that they are unsafe to use in the

"Your buildings,  infrastructure, etc is not designed to be in microwave ovens. The 
oscillations of atoms and molecules 180 degrees 1.8 billion times per second, 86,400 
times a day is one antenna, wi -fi was 4.9 billion times per second."  
 
He states, "The US plan is to mass  install 300,000 mini towers for the 5G grid. Killing 
your taxpayers, crops, economy and losing the tax base is a national and 
international security issue. President Trump doesn’t know what the previous 
political interests did. Mr Obama legacy will includ e the first African American 
President to put all races in a mad made microwave oven; Trump is making the

▪ FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr  responded by continuing to deny health risks and 
quoted Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., Director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and 
Radiological Health. The FDA appears to be another captured agency as it denies 
there is harm instead of recognizing the NTP study's "clear evidence" of cancer and 
DNA
