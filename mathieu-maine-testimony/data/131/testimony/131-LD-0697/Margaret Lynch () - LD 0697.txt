Dear
Esteemed
Maine
Legislators
:
Thank
you
for
addressing
technology
risk
management.
Please
do
everything
in
your
power
to
ensure
Maine
takes
ur gent
action
this
session
on
LD

-
Resolve,
to
Study
the
Ef fects
of
5G
T echnology
on
Bird,
Bee
and
Insect
Populations
and
the
Ef fects
of
Long-term
Exposure
on
Children.
A
review
of
1 13
studies
from
original
peer -reviewed
publications
on
the
ecological
ef fects
of
radiofrequency
electromagnetic
fields
(Cucurachi
et
al
,
2013
Envir onment
International
)
found
RF-EMF
had
a
significant
ef fect
on
birds,
insects,
other
vertebrates,
other
or ganisms
and
plants
in
70%
of
the
studies.
The
development
and
reproduction
of
birds
and
insects
were
the
most
strongly
impacted.
I
am
sending
summary
information
on
relevant
and
current
scientific
research
articles
which
highlight
negative
environmental
impacts
from
low
level
RF
radiation,
particularly
pertaining
to
the
Class
Insecta
Order
Hymenoptera.
It
is
important
to
understand
that
the
Electromagnetic
Spectrum
is
ener gy
that
travels
in
the
form
of
a
wave.
Scientists
talk
about
that
radiation
(ener gy)
in
terms
of
frequency .
Over
the
past
few
years,
a
phenomenon
known
as
Colony
Collapse
Disorder
(CCD)
has
gained
the
attention
and
concerns
of
entomologists
with
respect
to
the
survival
of
colonies
of
honey
bees.
Honey
bees
are
in
the
Order
Hymenoptera
(Ants,
Bees,
W asps).
The
reduction
in
population
of
bees
worldwide
could
have
serious
ecological
and
economic
implications
given
their
role
as
pollinators.
●
Kumar
et.
al
.
(201 1,
T oxicology
International
)
studied
the
metabolic
changes
with
respect
to
proteins,
carbohydrates,
and
lipids
in
hemolymph
of
worker
honeybee
of
Apis
mellifera
L.
exposed
to
cell
phone
radiation.
They
found
RF
radiation
influenced
honey
bees’
behavior
and
physiology ,
reduced
motor
activity
of
the
worker
bees
on
the
comb
and
a
rise
in
concentration
of
biomolecules
including
proteins,
carbohydrates
and
lipids.
●
Cummaerts
et.
al
(2013,
Electr omagnetic
Biology
and
Medicine
)
used
the
ant
species
Myrmica
sabuleti
as
a
model
to
study
the
impact
of
electromagnetic
waves
on
social
insects'
response
to
their
pheromones
and
their
food
collection.
Researchers
looked
at
worker
ants'
response
to
their
trail
marking
and
alarm
pheromone.
They
found
that
under
the
influence
of
electromagnetic
radiation
at
900MHz,
ants
became
unable
to
return
to
their
nest
and
recruit
congeners.
After
180
hours
of
exposure,
their
colonies
deteriorated.
●
Darney
et
al
.
(2015,
Apidology
)
used
three
groups
of
eight-day-old
honeybees
and
exposed
one
group
to
HF
(13.56
MHz)
or
one
group
to
ultra-high-frequency
(UHF ,
868
MHz)
radio
frequency
waves
and
one
group
received
no
exposure
for
a
total
of
two
hours.
They
observed
an
increase
in
mortality
for
both
groups
receiving
HF
and
UHF
exposure
after
seven
days.
●
T aye
et.
al
(2017,
Journal
of
Entomology
and
Zoology
Studies
)
found
that
the
foraging
behavior
of
honey
bee
colonies
in
close
proximity
to
cell
phone
towers
were
most
af fected
by
the
electromagnetic
radiation
emitted
by
the
cell
phone
tower .
●
Odemer
and
Odemer
(2019,
Science
of
the
T otal
Envir onment
)
exposed
honey
bee
queen
larvae
to
the
radiation
in
the
900 MHz
band
during
the
larval
and
pupal
stage.
After
14 days
of
exposure,
researchers
found
that
Chronic
RF-EMF
exposure
significantly
reduced
hatching
of
honey
bee
queens
by
44%.
●
Lopatina
et.
al.
(2019,
Entomological
Review
)
studied
the
ef fect
of
non-ionizing
electromagnetic
radiation
on
honey
bees
and
found
it
had
a
significant
inhibitory
ef fect
on
food
excitability
and
short-term
memory
in
honeybees.
●
Shepard
et.
al
(2019,
PLOS
ONE
)
investigated
the
ef fects
of
field-realistic
levels
of
electromagnetic
fields
(which
are
used
to
propagate
a
frequency)
on
aversive
learning
and
aggression
levels
in
honey
bees.
They
discovered
reduced
aversive
learning
performance
by
over
20%
of
the
bees
as
well
as
increased
aggression
scores
by
60%,
in
response
to
intruder
bees
from
foreign
hives.
Researchers
concluded
that
these
behavioral
changes
could
have
wider
ecological
implications
in
terms
of
the
ability
of
bees
to
interact
with,
and
respond
appropriately
to,
threats
and
negative
environmental
stimuli.
According
to
scientific
research,
Radio
Frequency
radiation
has
negative
impacts
on
hymenoptera
in
the
local
environment.
It
is
imperative
that
we
as
a
community
preserve
or ganisms
that
not
only
have
an
economic
benefit
but
a
benefit
to
the
ecosystem
at
lar ge.
W ireless
technology
should
not
mean
lowering
the
health
and
safety
over
time
of
the
local
ecology
or
environment.
Radiofrequency
radiation
goes
against
conservation
ef forts.
