  Please reconsider this bill as ham radio is designed to help people.  When we had a 
major ice storm here in DownEast Maine a boy Scout from my son's former troop 
used his radio to help elder people get water when the power was out, also to get to a 
warming shelter. 
  My son studied and got a license and a call sign.  Two years later he went into the 
Navy and became a radioman.  Also, some schools have had a teacher with the right 
license and engaged their classes to communicate with the crew of a space shuttle.
  Thank you for your consideration in the above examples where the use of a ham 
radio was beneficial to all age groups.
