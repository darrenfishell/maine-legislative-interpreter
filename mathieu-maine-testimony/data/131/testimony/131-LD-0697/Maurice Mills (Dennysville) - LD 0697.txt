I am providing testimony on HP466/LD-697.  I am one of the 4500 amateur radio operators in 
Maine that could be negatively impacted by this proposed legislation. In other states and 
jurisdictions similar bills have resulted in unnecessary restrictions on both amateur radio and the 
standard communications systems used by first responders and other state and federal agencies. 
Amateur radio operators are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, and must 
pass tests before become licensed.  A provision of the license is that each amateur radio operator 
conduct an initial evaluation of the RF emissions produced by their station and repeat this 
evaluation whenever changes to equipment or antennas are made to be sure their stations meets 
federal limits and guidelines. 
I suspect that few people realize that the potential impacts that RF radiation may have depend on 
a variety of factors including the frequency and power of the equipment that generates the 
radiation, the antenna, and proximity of a receptor to the source of the RF. 
I would like to point out that many amateur radio operators provide communications (local, 
national, and international) during emergency situations when all other normal means of 
communications are down.  Many amateur radio operators belong to the Amateur Radio 
Emergency Services (ARES) and Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services (RACES). In 
February 2023 a joint resolution of the State of Maine Legislature recognized the great volunteer 
services that Maine Amateur Radio Operators provide at no cost. 
If a decision is made to move this legislation forward, it should contain clear language the 
amateur radio and emergency communications users be exempt from any future restrictions.   
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important matter and would be available to 
discuss this matter if you have questions or require additional information.
