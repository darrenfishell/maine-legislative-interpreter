Please pass this proposed legislation as my children have been harmed by wireless 
radiation and we are asking our legislators, as the mothers before me have asked, for 
some kind of protection. In our own home, we limit RF radiation exposure. Our 
technology is all hard wired, yet, when a cell tower goes up outside your home, or a 
school is so filled with wireless routers and literally a thousand wireless chrome 
books, your child cannot avoid this exposure. It makes it even more important that 
homes become sanctuaries. My neighbors have lost their homes because of getting 
sick from the cell tower. Their children were sick and they had to leave. Sadly this is a
story you don't hear about it is an inconvenient truth to have to think about siting 
infrastructure away from children and vulnerable populations. I look forward to 
testifying this afternoon. With gratitude for your care and action on this very 
important issue.
