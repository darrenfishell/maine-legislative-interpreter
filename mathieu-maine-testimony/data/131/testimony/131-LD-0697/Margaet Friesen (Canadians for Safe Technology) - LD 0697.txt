Evidence used to support 
the “complement” to 
Safety Code 6 that doubled 
human exposure limits for 
5G devices: 
•The only effects on humans 
relied on were “over -
heating” effects and pain 
sensation. Studies (10) were 
30 minutes or less exposure 
time.
•All animal studies (12) were 
short term studies and none 
were considered to be of 
“high quality.”
•Findings from tissue and cell 
studies were excluded from 
the analysis. Page 32.
