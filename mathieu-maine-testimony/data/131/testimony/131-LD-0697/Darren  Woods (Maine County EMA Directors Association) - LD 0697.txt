Testimony in Opposition of H.P. 466/LD -697 
 
SUBMITTED BY:  Darren R. Woods, Chair of the Maine County Emergency 
Management Director’s Council.   
 
The wording in the text of HP 466/LD -697 could be interpreted to include the 
Amateur Radio Service, and other communications services that use “radio 
frequency emissions.” The Maine  State Legislature issued a joint resolution in 
February, 2023 recognizing the public service that the 4,500 amateur (H AM) 
radio operators contribute here in Maine. They are crucial during times of 
emergency, and many licensed HAM s support their local and state Emergency 
Management  Agencies.  
 
It is becoming increasingly important with the many threats we face, natural, 
man-made and intentional, we must have a reliable backbone for communications 
during these events.  Our County E mergency Management Agencies (EMA)  
utilize these important communications teams for this role and we have to ensure 
that they are exempt from this type of legislation.  
 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already requires licensed 
amateur radio operators to conduct RF exposure ev aluations on their ham radio 
systems when they are first set up, and whenever they make a change, such as 
installation of new antennas.  
 
If any legislation is introduced into the Maine Legislature to restrict, prohibit, or 
otherwise regulate such emissions , the Amateur Radio Service and other public 
safety communications should be exempt.  Please remember that the amateur 
radio service is protected by federal and Maine statute.
