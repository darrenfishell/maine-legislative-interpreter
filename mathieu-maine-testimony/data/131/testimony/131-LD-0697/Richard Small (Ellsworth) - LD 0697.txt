Greetings, my name is Richard Small and I live in Ellsworth. I have been an amateur 
radio operator for over 20 years. My amateur radio call sign is W1KRP issued to me 
by the FCC after studying and testing for my license. One thing we, as amateur radio 
operators, are highly aware of is legislative actions that could impact our radio 
service. Not only is ham radio, amateur radio, considered a hobby, but it is also a 
service used in times of emergency, serving such agencies as emergency management
offices, the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, hospitals and many other 
organizations.
The way this bill as it  is written, and being presented is rather vague, and should be 
narrowed down to the technologies that some know without a doubt are health 
hazards. As licensed by the FCC we are obligated to take all precautions necessary to 
make sure that there or no RF emissions being produced that would be dangerous to 
anyone within close proximity. Letting this bill just pass through without at least 
putting a stipulation that Amateur Radio would be exempt, and if not exempt would 
possibly eliminate a vital source of emergency communications. I ask for myself and 
all of the fellow amateur radio operators that this bill either not be presented, or at 
least rewritten , with more consideration, than how it is now being presented. There is
a lot more that rides on this bill than the original wording even comes close to 
describing. I thank you for your time, and all the work that is being done in Augusta.
