Sen. Lawrence, Rep Zeigler and members of the EUT Committee, we are Safe Tech International and testifying in favor of LD 697 as amended and as may be further amended to appoint an independent Commission, rather than the University of Maine, to conduct this study.   Given the increasing exposure to RFR in homes, businesses, schools and communities, and the preponderance of independent peer-reviewed studies showing health impacts to humans and wildlife, we strongly support the bill.    5G is a massive biological experiment inflicted on the public without informed consent, with no prior safety testing, and with credible scientific evidence indicating this technology will prove harmful to health and potentially fatal to some.  Our children depend on us and on government leaders around the globe to protect health and safety and to place these above all else.  And we, the public depend on committed independent researchers to further our understanding.   It is vital the study be independent due to the extreme gravity of potential harms to all biological systems on Earth.    The bipartisan NH Commission Report on 5G and RFR provides a great springboard for Maineâ€™s proposed study. Thank you for your consideration.
