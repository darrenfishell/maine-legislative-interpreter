LD 697
The wording in the text of HP 466/LD-697 could be interpreted to include the 
Amateur Radio Service, and other communications services that use “radio
frequency emissions” particularly emergency services.  The Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) already requires licensed
amateur radio operators to conduct RF exposure evaluations on their ham radio 
systems when they are first set up, and whenever they make a change, such as 
installation of new antennas.
If any legislation is introduced into the Maine Legislature to restrict, prohibit, or 
otherwise regulate such emissions, the Amateur Radio Service and other public safety
communications should be exempt. Please remember that the amateur radio service is 
protected by federal and Maine statute.
The Maine State Legislature issued a joint resolution in February, 2023 recognizing 
the public service that the 4,500 amateur (HAM) radio operators contribute here in 
Maine. They are crucial during times of emergency, and many licensed HAMs 
support their local and state Emergency Management Agencies.
It is becoming increasingly important with the many threats we face, natural,
man-made and intentional, we must have a reliable backbone for communications 
during these events. Our County Emergency Management Agencies (EMA) utilize 
these important communications teams for this role and we have to ensure that they 
are exempt from this type of legislation.
Sincerely,
Damon Leibert, N1LJK
