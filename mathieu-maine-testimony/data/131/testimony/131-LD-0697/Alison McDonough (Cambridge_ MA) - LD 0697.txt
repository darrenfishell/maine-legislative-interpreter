I have been struggling with the negative health effects of the unregulated deployment 
of wireless technologies in Cambridge, Massachusetts. With the deployment of 5G in 
March of 2020 I lost my ability to walk and talk normally and with the installation of 
new antennas on my block just before Thanksgiving, I can now no longer speak at all.
The industry is refusing to recognize the research, there's just too much money in it 
for them. But 5G boasts signal strengths of up multiple tens of BILLIONS of 
Hertz/sec. The human heart operates on just 3 Hertz a second. THREE. Nature runs 
on 1.5 hertz a second. Some people are more sensitive than others. But that doesn't 
mean that everyone, birds and bees included, are not getting hurt. Needless to say, I 
am looking to relocate to a safer location. I would definitely be thrilled if Maine 
turned out to be the first state of the Union to take this problem seriously.
