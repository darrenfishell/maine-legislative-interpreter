As an amateur radio operator, I am against the move to remove or eliminate access to 
RF spectrum and devices in the state of Maine. In many severe weather events, much 
of our wired communications infrastructure fails and the only reliable 
communications is through wireless means provided by amateur radio. The services 
we provide enable emergency responders to provide life saving services to those in 
need. In normal conditions, amateur radio provides communications services for 
emergency responders to coordinate activities in areas not covered by other services.
In a broader sense, wireless communications services provide innumerable beneficial 
capabilities to all Maine residents and visitors. Two of the three 5G bands are already 
heavily used and have been for decades. It doesn't make sense to decide that these 
frequencies pose a threat all of a sudden - it's not based on sound science.
Let's not act like Chicken Little because an uninformed person read about a 
conspiracy theory that's be proven wrong multiple times over several years. This is a 
bill that should die peacefully in its sleep.
