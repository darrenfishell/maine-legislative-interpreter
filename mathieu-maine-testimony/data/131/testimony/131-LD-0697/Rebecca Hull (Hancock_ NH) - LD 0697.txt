I have considered buying a second property in Maine but know that if there were 5G 
or microwave towers close by that would make it impossible, as I would suffer greatly
from the microwave radiation.  This comes from years of paying attention to how my 
body reacts to microwave radiation.  I also know that the conductive resonance that 
these radio frequencies create on power lines would render the electric quality poor, 
raise electric bills and cause additional health issues.  Whenever considering the 
effects of long term exposure on children, we must also consider those on seniors and 
people with other health issues.  That said, if these exposures are too much for those 
populations, they are too much for all biological entities on our planet.  Current 
studies show that and it just makes sense.
