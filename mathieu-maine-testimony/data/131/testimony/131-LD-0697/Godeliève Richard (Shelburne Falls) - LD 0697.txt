Hello,
Please help reduce electromagnetic pollution. I have been suffering for about 13 years severe
symptoms due to this pollution. Please see attached 2 diagnosis by 2 MDs.
I am very worried for our wildlife and farm life which we need to be healthy to be able to live.
My husband made this film about what we lived when I got sick from electromagnetic 
pollution. Please watch it and learn about this serious problem. 
Private link to watch the film:

Thank you for your work.
Kind Regards,
Godeliève
