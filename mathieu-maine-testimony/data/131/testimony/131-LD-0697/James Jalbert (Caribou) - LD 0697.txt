May name is James Jalbert (KC1ECV), and I have been  an amateur Radio operator 
for 8 years, and also belong to a County Emergency Radio Team. Amateur radio play 
a huge part in emergency services, and with out it, many times information could not 
make it to its destination with out our service. I am strongly opposed to this bill, 
especially with out an amateur radio exemption. As per FCC rules we are required to 
conduct RF Exposure testing, and must keep our stations within the allowed tolerance
for such exposure. I feel this bill, with out an amateur radio exemption will negatively
impact communications in any and all emergency situations. I strongly urge this bill 
not be not be entertained, unless an amateur radio exemption is put in place
