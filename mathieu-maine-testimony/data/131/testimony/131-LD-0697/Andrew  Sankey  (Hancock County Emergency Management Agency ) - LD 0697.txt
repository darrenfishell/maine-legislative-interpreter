Greetings, Committee members. 
I am writing in my capacity as director of the Hancock County Emergency 
Management Agency to ask that you please recognize the vital role of Amateur Radio
in Maine's emergency communications. 
As such, I ask that you please ensure any proposed legislation not impede, restrict, nor
otherwise limit radio emissions generated through the transmission or reception of 
Amateur Radio, beyond that already provided for by the rules and regulations now 
in-place per the Federal Communications Commission. 
In Maine, especially in our rural jurisdictions, the lack of communications 
infrastructure, including that of public safety, see us depend upon Amateur Radio as a
primary resource to us both in routine circumstances and when necessary during times
of emergency. I cannot overstate the critical resource Amateur Radio and its volunteer
HAM Radio operators provide us daily throughout Maine. Thank you for your time 
and consideration of these facts. 
Very Respectfully, 
Andrew Sankey, Director 
Hancock County Emergency Management Agency
