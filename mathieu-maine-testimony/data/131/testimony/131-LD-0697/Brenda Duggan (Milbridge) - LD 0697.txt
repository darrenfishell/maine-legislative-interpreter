Testimony in opposition of H.P. 466/LD-697 – RESOLVE TO STUDY THE 
EFFECTS OF 5G TECHNOLOGY ON BIRD, BEE, AND INSECT POPULATIONS
AND THE EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM EXPOSURE ON CHILDREN
SUBMITTED BY: Brenda Duggan, RN, Amateur Radio Operator N1ZPV
I have been a nurse for 50 years and an amateur (ham) radio operator for 25 years. I 
think I would recognize ill-health effects upon my family related to “radio frequency 
emissions.”  My children and granddaughter all grew up in an environment saturated 
with RF emissions from ham radio, wifi, public safety communications and even 
military communications, and have never exhibited any symptoms of excessive RF 
exposure or any other ailment.
Speculation, rumor, and unsound science are not reason to spend the taxpayers money
that these bills cost, or to unnecessarily regulate industries or services without solid 
proof. 
As for the amateur radio service, it is protected under federal and Maine law.  I urge 
that this bill be rejected. If by some chance a piece of legislation is passed, please 
make sure that the Amateur Radio Service and public safety communications are 
exempt.
