Environmental Health Trust (EHT) is a nonprofit Think Tank and policy organization dedicated to identifying and
reducing environmental health hazards. EHT provides independent scientific research and advice on controllable
environmental hazards to local, state and national governments. Today, we write to advise you of scientific grounds
for major health and environmental concerns about the proposal for the
i
nstallation of wireless telecommunications
facilities and associated infrastructure at nine developed areas in the park
and to express our grave concerns
about
this planned expansion of mobile communications in Grand Teton National Park. You may recall your discussions
last year with me about the need to limit exposures to wildlife and fauna from wireless radiation that took place
when we met as part of the City Kids final ascent of the Grand.
We fully recognize there is a need for communication for emergency purposes. We further recognize that the Park
plays a unique role in our country and in our lives by providing a wilderness that is apart from the normal hectic life
that many Americans lead today. We are deeply concerned that by expanding wireless communications this proposal
will irrevocably impair the wilderness experience and that there are wired solutions that would be far less damaging.
The transmissions to and from these proposed microwave wireless installations will be emissions that are an
environmental pollutant known to cause cancer (in both experimental animals and humans) and other adverse health
and environmental effects (e.g., on birds, bees, trees) according to internationally recognized authoritative research,
including studies conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program, which is the nation’s premiere testing
program.
In light of the scientific documentation showing harmful effects, EHT writes today to advise regarding technical
scientific information on impacts to human health, wildlife and the environment, explaining why more than
400
expert scientists
are calling for immediate reductions
in exposures to microwave wireless radiation and to halt the
5G rollout.
Documented Impacts to Wildlife and the Environment
We would like to make you aware that there is growing literature showing the adverse impacts of microwave
radiation on animal and bird behavior and physiology, as well as plants and trees. As the
Natural Resources
Defense
Council
and the Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility have argued, an environmental impact

Environmental effects include disruptions to reproduction,
development, orientation, and migration of animals,

Albert Manville, former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agency lead on avian-structural impacts, wrote
“A
BRIEFING MEMORANDUM: What We Know, Can Infer, and Don’t Yet Know about Impacts from Thermal and
Non-thermal Non-ionizing Radiation to Birds and Other Wildlife”
documenting the body of research and
4
concluding:
“There is an increasing body of published laboratory research that finds DNA damage at low intensity
exposures — well below levels of thermal heating — which may be comparable to far field exposures from
cell antennas. This body of work would apply to all species, including migratory birds, since DNA is DNA,
whether single-strand or double helix. The first study to find such effects was conducted by H. Lai and N.P.
Singh in 1995 (Lai and Singh 1995). Their work has since been replicated (e.g., Lai and Singh 1996, as
well as in hundreds of other more recent published studies), performed in at least 14 laboratories
worldwide. The take-home message: low level transmission of EMF from cell towers and other sources
probably causes DNA damage. The laboratory research findings strongly infer this relationship. Since DNA
is the primary building block and genetic “map” for the very growth, production, replication and survival of
all living organisms, deleterious effects can be critical.”

“
Exposure of Insects to Radio-Frequency Electromagnetic
Fields from 2 to 120 GHz
” published in
Scientific Reports is the first study to investigate how insects (including the Western honeybee) absorb the
higher frequencies (2 GHz to 120 GHz) to be used in the 4G/5G rollout. The scientific simulations showed
increases in absorbed power between 3% to 370% when the insects were exposed to the frequencies.
Researchers concluded, “This could lead to changes in insect behavior, physiology, and morphology over
time….”

Researchers published a study on
frogs
in Electromagnetic
Biology and Medicine exposing eggs and
tadpoles to electromagnetic radiation from cell phone antennas for two months, from the egg phase until an
advanced phase of tadpole and found low coordination of movements, an asynchronous growth, resulting in
both big and small tadpoles, and a high mortality rate. The authors conclude, “these results indicate that
radiation emitted by phone masts in a real situation may affect the development and may cause an increase
in mortality of exposed tadpoles.”
16
We also want to bring your attention to the growing body of literature showing the impacts on trees and plants. Here
again, experimental literature has found that rhizomes, nitrification and other critical processes to plant growth and
health are affected by cell phone like radiation under controlled conditions. There have been over one hundred
studies that have shown this and most recently a
field
study
that showed under controlled conditions, trees
that are
17
closer to cell phone towers start to die more readily; and this can be seen if one looks at the branches of the trees
closest to the antennae of the cell phone tower with the fake tree at the Stilson parking lot off Hwy 390.

indicate that the RF background may be adversely affecting leaf and shoot growth and inhibiting fall
production of anthocyanins associated with leaf senescence in trembling aspen seedlings. These effects
suggest that exposure to the RF background may be an underlying factor in the recent rapid decline of

“Our analysis demonstrates that the data from a
substantial amount of the studies on RF-EMFs from mobile phones show physiological and/or
morphological effects (89.9%, p < 0.001). Additionally, our analysis of the results from these reported
studies demonstrates that the maize, roselle, pea, fenugreek, duckweeds, tomato, onions and mungbean

Electromagnetic Fields Alter Animal and Insect Orientation

scientist Alforso Balmori’s  “
Anthropogenic
radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as an emerging threat to wildlife orientation
,” which states, “Current
evidence
indicates that exposure at levels that are found in the environment (in urban areas and near base stations) may
particularly alter the receptor organs to orient in the magnetic field of the earth. These results could have important
implications for migratory birds and insects, especially in urban areas, but could also apply to birds and insects in
natural and protected areas where there are powerful base station emitters of radiofrequencies. Therefore, more
research on the effects of electromagnetic radiation in nature is needed to investigate this emerging threat.”

photoreceptors that allow birds to use built-in receptors as a biological compass.
In 2012 the government of India’s Ministry of the Environment and Forest issued a
report
on the potential

A
2017 report to UNESCO
by botanist Mark Broomhall
details the association between increasing amounts of
29
electromagnetic radiation from cellular antennas on the Mt. Nardi tower complex and species disappearance and
exodus from the Mt. Nardi area of the Nightcap National Park World Heritage Area during a 15-year period
(2000-2015). He estimates “in both volume and species that from 70 to 90 % of the wildlife has become rare or has
disappeared from the Nightcap National Park within a radius of the Mt. Nardi tower complex. This statement can be
summarised with concrete data: 3 bat species once common have become rare or gone, 11 threatened and
endangered bird species are gone, 11 migratory bird species are gone, 86 bird species are demonstrating unnatural
behaviours, 66 once common bird species are now rare or gone.” The Report concludes, “With these short
explanations of events we can appreciate that the effects of this technology and its application on Mt. Nardi over the
last fifteen years, affect not only the top of the life chain species but they are devastating the fabric of the continuity
of the World Heritage, causing genetic deterioration in an insidious, massive and ever escalating scale. To truly
understand what these studies reveal is to stare into the abyss.”
It is very important that in considering antenna placement, there be a full environmental assessment on migratory
animal patterns (from the smallest to the largest) and not simply on birds and mammals like the pronghorn but also
on impacts to amphibians and insects.

Once the towers are erected they will be upgraded over time with new antennas and soon 5G technology. 5G would
use today’s wireless frequencies while adding new, higher frequencies to transmit data at faster speeds. These higher
frequency millimeter waves uniquely penetrate the eyes and skin,

,
Any future applications of these technologies must
56
57
consider the biological effect of cumulative exposures to these frequencies.
Radiofrequency radiation exposure is increasing at a rapid pace.
A
2018 article
published in
The Lancet Planetary Health
points to unprecedented increasing RF exposures, and the
abstract concludes, “due to the exponential increase in the use of wireless personal communication devices (eg,
mobile or cordless phones and WiFi or Bluetooth-enabled devices) and the infrastructure facilitating them, levels of
exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation around the 1 GHz frequency band, which is mostly used for
modern wireless communications, have increased from extremely low natural levels by about 1018
times…”(
Bandara and Carpenter 2018
).
58
Another key finding from
Zothansiama 2017
was that
homes closer to antennas had measurably higher radiation
levels—adding to the documentation that antennas increase RF levels. An
Australian study
also found that children
in kindergartens with nearby antenna installations had nearly three-and-a-half times higher RF exposures than
children with installations further away (more than 300 meters (
Bhatt 2016
).
59
A 2018 multi-country
study
that measured RF in several
countries found that cell phone tower radiation is the
dominant contributor to RF exposure in most outdoor areas exposure in urban areas was higher and that exposure
has drastically increased. As an example, the measurements the researchers
took
in Los Angeles, USA was 70 times
higher than the US EPA estimate 40 years ago.
60
FCC limits are non-protective
FCC limits are based only on thermal heating and do not account for biological impacts at levels far lower than FCC
limits. The Department of Interior wrote a
2014 letter
on the impact of cell towers on migratory birds documenting
several studies that found adverse effects and concludes that “The electromagnetic radiation standards used by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) continue to be based on thermal heating, a criterion now nearly 30
years out of date and inapplicable today.”
61
In the United States, RFR radiation regulatory limits were set by the FCC more than two decades ago in 1996.
However, the FCC limits are not safety standards. Although the EPA was actively researching this issue and tasked

to develop proper safety limits,
,
the EPA was abruptly defunded in 1996 and the FCC adopted guidelines
62
63
developed by industry-connected non-independent groups (
ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992
,
NCRP’s 1986 Report
)
Experts
64
from U.S. government agencies (including the EPA and NIOSH) have repeatedly documented issues concerning the
inadequacy of these limits but their letters have gone unanswered.
,
The EPA has clarified that the
FCC limits do
65
66
not protect against effects from long-term low-level exposures.
In 2008, the National Academy of Sciences
67
released a
Report
on research needs that included
recommending research on the impacts to brain development and
exposures to children and pregnant women.
68
In 2012, the Government Accountability Office issued a
Report
calling for RFR standards to be updated
with current
research recommending that the
FCC formally reassess
the current RF energy exposure limit, including its effects
on
human health, the costs,  and benefits associated with keeping the current limit, and the opinions of relevant health
and safety agencies, and change the limit if determined appropriate. In response to the
2012 GAO Report
,
the FCC
opened proceedings (
ET Docket No. 13-84 Reassessment
of FCC Radiofrequency Exposure Limits
and
ET Docket
No. 03-137 Proposed Changes in the Commission’s Rules Regarding Human Exposure to Radiofrequency
Electromagnetic Fields)
to explore whether it should
modify its radiofrequency exposure standards. The
FCC also
noted
, “we specifically seek comment as to whether
our current limits are appropriate as they relate to device use by
children.”
In 2020 Environmental Health Trust filed historic legal action against the FCC calling on the FCC
to
fully review
the record and update its 25-year-old wireless radiation exposure guidelines for radio-frequency radiation (RFR)
from cell phones, cell towers, Wi-Fi, 5G and other wireless communication devices

demonstrate the potential for RFR to cause cancer in humans.” The

also
filed critical briefs on injuries sustained from
exposures allowed by FCC exposure guidelines.

On August 13, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit mandated the FCC explain how
its 1996 limits addressed health effects from long term exposure, especially for children and the environment in their
judgment in the case
Environmental Health Trust et
al. v. The FCC
.  Yet the FCC has not responded.
There has not been a review of the adequacy of FCC limits based on a review of the totality of the science. There is
no US agency with health or environmental expertise ensuring safety for cell tower radiation emissions, nor for 5G,
which will employ higher frequencies and higher data rates.
The Environmental Working Group published
a study
in
Environmental Health
analyzing the findings of
tumor and
heart damage from the National Toxicology Program study and concluded that FCC limits should be strengthened by
200 to 400 times to protect children according to current risk assessment guidelines. Yet FCC limits have remained
unchanged since 1996.
European Parliament requested a research report
“Health Impact of 5G
” released in July 2021 concluding that
commonly used RFR frequencies (450 to 6000 MHz) are probably carcinogenic for humans
and
clearly affect
male
fertility with possible adverse effects on the development of embryos, fetuses and newborns.
Children are more vulnerable.
Children’s skulls are thinner, their heads are smaller, and the radiation penetrates deeper into their brain. Research
has found that a child’s head’s absorption can be over two times greater, and absorption of the skull’s bone marrow
can be ten times greater, than adults.

The American
Academy of Pediatrics, which is the largest organization of
73
74
U.S. pediatricians, has repeatedly
written
to the
U.S. government documenting children’s vulnerabilities and
recommends reducing children’s and pregnant women’s exposure.
75
The
California Department of Health

20

are recommending wireless exposure
reduction, especially for children.

Several countries have allowable public exposure limits lower than ICNIRP levels with limits that are even more
protective for kindergartens, schools and hospitals. In addition, some governments’ regulatory actions include
banning cell phones or removing Wi-Fi and cell towers in or near schools.
For example:
77
●
Belgium and France have banned the sale of cell phones designed for young children and made it illegal to
market cell phones to children less than 14 years of age.
●
France has banned cell phones in elementary and middle schools, and playgrounds.
78
●
The Supreme Court of India upheld the High Court of the State of Rajasthan’s decision to remove all cell
towers from the vicinity of schools, hospitals and playgrounds because this radiation is “hazardous” and
causes cancer, brain tumour, digestive disorder and tachycardia.
79
●
The Environment Minister of Italy has decreed to reduce as much as possible indoor exposure to both
ELF-EMF and RF-EMF.
●
Cyprus has banned Wi-Fi from kindergartens and elementary classrooms.
●
In Chile, the 2012
“Antenna Law”
prohibits cell antennas/towers in “sensitive areas” such as “educational
institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, hospitals, clinics, nursing homes or other institutions of similar
nature.”
80
Children will have a lifetime of exposure to wireless radiation; in order to protect their healthy future, public health
authorities must limit this exposure as much as possible.
Moreover,
recent cell phone radiation tests
released
by the French government found that nine out of ten cell phones
exceed regulatory limits for radiofrequency radiation when tested in body contact positions (simulating a phone in
pants pocket, bra or resting on chest). Despite this documentation, U.S. radiation limits have still not been revised.
To this date, there has been no public record of an independent systematic review of the research by any U.S. health
agency in order to set proper safety standards. The current outdated regulations are inadequate to protect public
health.
Since 1997, insurance companies have refused to insure wireless companies and “
electromagnetic field exclusions
”
in insurance policies are an industry standard. EMFs are deemed as “high-risk” in insurance
white papers
,
and EMFs
are
defined
as a “pollutant” by many insurance companies
alongside smoke, chemicals, and asbestos. Some
companies will only cover liability from EMFs under additional “
Pollution Liability
” policy enhancement
coverage.
Some policies not only exclude damages from EMFs but also exclude paying for the defense of “
any supervision,
instruction, recommendation, warning or advice given or which should have been given in connection with bodily
injury, property damage, abatement and/or mitigation etc.
”
Wireless companies
warn
their shareholders—in mandated
annual
10k filings
—that they may incur financial
losses
from lawsuits related to EMF radiation emissions of their products. For example:
●
AT&T
states,
“We may incur significant expenses defending
such suits or government charges and may be
required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect
our operations or financial results.”

Crown Castle’s
2016 10-K ANNUAL REPORT
states,
“If radio frequency emissions from wireless
handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects,
potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues. The potential connection
between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has
been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that
claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies
will not be adverse to us...If a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health
effects were established, our operations, costs, or revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We
currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.”
Most wireless companies—from
AT&T
to
Nokia
to
T Mobile
to
Verizon Wireless
—have issued
similar warnings
to
their shareholders.
81
Will the visiting public to the National Parks also be warned of the risk?
Scientists Worldwide: Reduce Exposure
An increasing number of
experts
around the world are
calling for reduced exposure—due to the unprecedented
threat to public health and the environment—to stop the installation of radiation-emitting equipment placed within
meters of homes, playgrounds, and schools.
●
In 2015, the
International EMF Scientist Appeal
, now
signed by over 225 scientists from 41 nations, urging
the development of more protective guidelines for EMF (including RF-EMF), encouraging precautionary
measures, and calling for education of the public about health risks, particularly risks to children and fetal
development, was submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Director-General of the
World Health Organization, and U.N. Member Nations.
82
●
In June 2017, EMF Scientists submitted
Comments to
the U.S. FCC
, asking the FCC to critically consider
the potential impact of the 5th generation wireless infrastructure on the health and safety of the U.S.
population before proceeding to deploy this infrastructure.
●
In September 2017, I joined over 180 experts from 35 countries who sent a
declaration
to the European
Union calling for a moratorium on 5G until hazards have been fully investigated by independent scientists,
citing potential neurological impacts, infertility, and cancer.
83
The tobacco and asbestos crises demonstrate that failing to act on public health hazards when they arise can lead to
irreversible damage later. EHT thus strongly opposes building out 5G infrastructure—which would place thousands
of new sources of microwave radiation emissions in close proximity to workers, families, and local wildlife—at
least until more testing has been conducted.
Respectfully submitted,
