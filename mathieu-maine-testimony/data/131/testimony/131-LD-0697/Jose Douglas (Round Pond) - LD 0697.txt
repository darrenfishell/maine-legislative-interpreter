Good day!
I am an Amateur Radio Operator in Lincoln County, Jose Douglas KB1TCD.
We are also bee keepers as well as poultry farmers having had anywhere between two
and five bee colonies in the past decade, currently we have two beehives.
My various wire amateur radio antennas are within five to ten feet from our bee hives 
and we have never had problems with our bees! 
There are also plentiful insects for our hens as well as for other birds.
Whereas I do agree that 5G technology is potentionally harmful to humans, it operates
on a completely different wave spectrum that does amateur radio . 5G technology was
first introduced over 25 years ago and IBM nixed it after studies showed adverse 
effects on the human body.
Amateur Radio has been using the same frequencies for more than 125 years without 
causing harm to human life or vegetation.
Amateur Radio operators worldwide help communities in case of communication 
disruptions when there is an emergency by providing their services to Emergency 
Management Offices and Fire Stations.
I suggest and strongly hope that you delete any language that would adversely affect 
amateur radio out of your proposed legislature.
Emergency Communication is a key role in our society and should not be taken 
lightly.
Sincerely,
Jose P Douglas KB1TCD
