I became aware that all wireless devices cause me to lose function, back in Summer, 2012. I 
learned, over time and with personal experience, that all wireless devices are different, eg 
different signal strengths resulting in different levels of health effects on me. My health effects
are a long list, and effect all systems of my body- energy, sleep, heart, hormonal, digestive, 
cognitive, and more.
I have had to move several times to get away from newly erected wireless systems that were 
not there before. This makes finding a safe place for me to live impossible to predict and feel 
secure in my future.
I learned that the Smart Electric Metering wireless system is impossible for me to co-exist 
with. I lose all sleep, lose balance, digestive abilities, etc
There are many people like me who are struggling, and are trying to survive the effects of 
wireless radiation. Please consider all wireless systems while looking into 5G.
Thank you, Stephanie Dickerson
