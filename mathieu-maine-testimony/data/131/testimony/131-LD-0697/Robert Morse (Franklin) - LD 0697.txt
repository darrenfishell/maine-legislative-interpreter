Testimony in opposition of H.P. 466/LD-697 – RESOLVE TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF 5G TECHNOLOGY ON 
BIRD, BEE, AND INSECT POPULATIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM EXPOSURE ON CHILDREN 
 
SUBMITTED BY: Robert Morse, Amateur Operator License AB1EP, Untied Airlines Pilot retired 
After reading this document I find it broad in scope. It includes all radio frequency which would include 
your local emergency responders, government agencies, military, aviation, public service and amateur 
radio. 
In emergencies, amateur operators have helped for years. You don’t have to look far to find those facts. 
They have helped during earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. They have helped in hospitals, schools, 
plus search and rescue and a lot more.  
Amateur radio is already regulated by Federal and Maine law. To include amateur radio in H.P. 466/LD-
697 could restrict the good work that amateur radio operators do in emergencies and public events that 
are vital for safety. When all other means of communication fail amateur radio operators become vital 
to that emergency. Any restrictions in this bill could hamper life and safety efforts. 
I respectfully request that you reject this bill or narrow your scope to exempt amateur radio.
