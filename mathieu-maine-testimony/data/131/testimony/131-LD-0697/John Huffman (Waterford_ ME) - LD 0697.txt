I am an Amateur Radio operator in Waterford, Maine.  I spend much of my time 
volunteering my on-air operations toward emergency preparedness in our State.
The wording in the text of HP 466/LD-697 could be interpreted to include the 
Amateur Radio Service and other communications services that use â€œradio frequency 
emissions."  
The unintended consequence of the bill as written could be to impair emergency 
readiness.  Please consider modifications to exempt Amateur Radio.
Thank you,
John Huffman
