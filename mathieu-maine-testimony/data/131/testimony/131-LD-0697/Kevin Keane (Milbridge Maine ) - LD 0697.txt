Did you know that cell phone towers and internet service will be not available to 
public during time of war?
Amateur radio will again prove valuable in times off need.
Did you know Amateur Radio licensed operator call sign look up access is free and 
available as is all licensed radio service frequencies.
I do agree that harmful radio emissions to children and people are real danger to 
health.
I do not agree with taking our Amateur rights away because of uncertain data from 
recent years with unlicensed radio equipment such as smart phones and Wi-Fi and 
automobiles and our daily environment albeit home or public access to internet.
Please do not pass this bill restrictions of amateur radio.
Thank you
