Dear Committee Members,
I am writing out of concern about the unneeded expense, the vague language, and the 
possible consequences of this bill, especially how un-proven speculation could affect 
Amateur Radio. Licensed Amateur Radio operators are required to confirm that radio 
frequency emissions are maintained within safe limits.  Amateur Radio plays an 
important role when conventional communications are not available. I urge that 
amateur radio be excluded from any proposed legislation.
Thank you for your consideration.
