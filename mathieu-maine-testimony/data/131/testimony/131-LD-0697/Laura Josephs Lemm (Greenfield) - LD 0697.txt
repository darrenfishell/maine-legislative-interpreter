As 5G is rolled out and becomes more and more pervasive, the importance of 
studying its effects on all populations and the environment is becoming more and 
more important.  Birds, bees and insects are small beings and the effects may be 
especially devastating to these populations.  Children who are harmed so early in their
lives may have to bear the consequences for the duration of their lives/continue to 
suffer mounting cumulative effects.  Our pollinator populations are already declining 
at an alarming rate, and as our survival very much depends on this not continuing to 
happen, it would be wise to prioritize this type of study even if for that reason alone.  
I believe the importance of studying the effects of 5G on any and all populations/the 
environment cannot be overstated.
