LD 697
I am writing in support of LD697. This is so important to study the effects of 5G on 
our environment and children. The current and long-term health of our communities is
at stake. Nothing is more sacred than our collective health. 
I also support an amendment to remove University of Maine from the the study and 
and instead have an appointed commission. This was the model in New Hampshire. 
This commission would need to consist of independent community members, 
independent experts, and could not contain people with conflicts of interest who 
benefit financially from the expansion of 5G. A commission made up of volunteers 
would not require additional funds.
I truly hope that LD697 is passed with the suggested amendment. Thank you for your 
time.
