Re: LD697 - In Favor OfDear Sen. Lawrence, Rep Zeigler and members of the EUT Committee,My name is Liz Barris and am testifying in favor of LD 697 as amended and as may be further amended to appoint an independent Commission, rather than the University of Maine, to conduct this study. Please vote Ought to Pass as amended. Thank you.I run the non proﬁt thpeopleinitiative.org.  Myself and thousands of others in our group have been adversely effected and made sick with a whole host of health effects induced by EMFs.  I can no longer participate in society AT ALL due to the proliferation of wireless radiation emitting devices and infrastructure and can even no longer occupy my own home, sleeping and working in my car with extension cords for phone and internet, due to the 5G upgrade to my upstairs neighbors WIFI, which is un-blockable with 10 layers of German warfare shielding.  Studying the effects of 5G on children and bees is great, but direct action to stop the proliferation is better. Here is a page from our site devoted to birds and bees, ﬂowers and tress and EMFs.  https://thepeoplesinitiative.org/the-birds-the-bees/You will ﬁnd excellent peer reviewed and published studies and articles for your review on this subject, however, the testimony of peoples direct health effects should been enough, especially given that children are more vulnerable due to more rapid DNA changes.  We have also listed the content individually below…US Department of the Interior: “Non ionizing (wireless) cell tower radiation causes plumage deterioration, reduced survivor-ship and death to birds and wildlife, hypoxia and heart attacks to birds and offspring and even migratory nesting problems.”UNESCO WILDLIFE REPORT: Botanist Report Links Pulsed Microwave Radiation from Wireless Transmitters to Disappearance of Birds, Bats and InsectsMillions of bees die – are electromagnetic signals to blameIncreased and Reduced Aversive Learning in Honey Bees Exposed to Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic FieldsExposure to Cell Phone Radiation Produces Biochemical Changes in Worker Honey BeesMobile Phone Mast Effect on Common Frogs (Rana Temporaria) Tadpoles: The City Turned Into a LaboratoryNon Thermal GSM RF and ELF EMF Effects Upon Rat BBB PermeabilityAnts Can be Used as Bio-Indicators to Reveal Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Waves from Some Wireless ApparatusThe Incidence of Electromagnetic Pollution on Wild Mammals: A New Poison with a Slow
