The Environmental Health Trust has said of the FCC's failure as a reliable arbiter for 
the American public: "we have 25 year old safety limits for cell tower and wireless 
radiation, as well as a mounting body of science showing harm. Yet no health 
agencies are ensuring our safety by staying up to date with the totality of the science."
the FCC will not even allow concern over health risks to serve as a basis of rejection.
