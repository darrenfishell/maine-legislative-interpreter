Testimony in opposition of H.P. 466/LD-697 â€“ RESOLVE TO STUDY THE EFFECTS
OF 5G TECHNOLOGY ON BIRD, BEE, AND INSECT POPULATIONS AND THE
EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM EXPOSURE ON CHILDREN 
SUBMITTED BY: Richard Kelley, Amateur Radio Operator K1RMK
I understand that this bill is targeting 5G technology, however, the text of HP 466/LD-697 
could easily be interpreted to include the Amateur Radio Service, public service radio, 
emergency service radio, law enforcement radio, aircraft service and control radio, military 
radio, commercial broadcast radio and television, and ALL other communications that use 
radio frequency emissions.  These, and baby monitors, home WIFI, automobile key fobs, 
garage door remote controls, TV remote controls, and Bluetooth everything ALL use the 
pulsed and modulated radio frequency radiation at nonthermal levels  described in the 
text of this bill.
If any action is taken on this, or related bills, please ensure that there is a clearly stated, not 
overly broad, scope of study, with deliberate and thoughtful language that includes specific 
exemptions for the Amateur Radio Service as well as for emergency services, public services,
and law enforcement radio operations, and all common radio frequency emissions that are 
not included in the stated scope.
