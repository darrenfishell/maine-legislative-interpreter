A NEW FORM OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION: 
WIRELESS AND NON-IONIZING ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
Catherine Dodd PhD, RN, FAAN Environmental Health Consultant, former Chief District of Staff Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Deputy Chief of Staff for Health and Human Services to San Francisco Mayor (now CA Governor Newsom), former Director Region IX USDHHS under President Clinton. Theodora Scarato, MSW Executive DirectorEnvironmental Health Trust 
The wireless revolution and the expansion of the internet of things is rapidly increasing our exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic ﬁelds (EMFs) now considered a new form 
of environmental pollution (Russell, 2018, Bandara & Carpenter, 2018). Health and medical professionals recommend that we reduce these EMF exposures because of a growing body of research that documents adverse biological effects from low level exposures (Miller, 2019). 
This chapter will introduce what EMFs are, how people are exposed, science documenting health effects of exposure, U.S. and international policy on protection from EMFs and nursing implications for clinical practice and advocacy in concert with ANA’s principles.
WHAT ARE EMFS? 
EMFs are invisible energy waves consisting of electric and 
magnetic ﬁelds. For thousands of years, humans have been 
exposed to natural EMFs - such as the magnetic ﬁeld of 
the earth and light from the sun. However, exposure to human-made EMFs are a relatively recent phenomenon and the more complex data carrying signals of cellular networks have been found to have signiﬁcant biologic effects. (Panagopoulos, 2015). 
Humans are electrical beings. Our cells communicate with tiny electrical impulses which affect our heart, our brain, our nervous system, and our endocrine system. In health care, these electrical impulses are recorded as electric waves on electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms. 
IONIZING RADIATION VERSUS NON-IONIZING 
RADIATION
Electromagnetic ﬁelds include two types of radiation: 
ionizing and non-ionizing. Ionizing radiation has intense high energy, high frequency waves which can remove electrons from atoms or “ionize them” causing cellular damage and directly breaking DNA. Ionizing radiation is known to cause cancer. 
 Ionizing radiation is used in healthcare both diagnostically (e.g. x-rays and CT scans), and therapeutically to reduce tumors (radiation treatment). Protective precautions such as lead shields and minimizing exposure are required. Health care institutions have procedures for nurses and other staff who with patients receiving ionizing radiation therapy to minimize the health care providers’ exposures (Kaiser, 2001). 
In contrast, non-ionizing radiation (e.g. Wi-Fi, wireless 
networks, cell tower radiation) has much lower energy and lower frequency waves. Decades ago, cell phones and wireless networks were brought to market without long term safety studies because the frequencies were non-ionizing and assumed to be safe. While non-ionizing radiation is not thought to cause DNA damage in the same way that ionizing radiation does, recent studies indicate that DNA damage and other adverse health effects can result from non-ionizing radiation, via a more complex indirect process (Lai, 2021, Panagopoulos et al., 2021). 
 
Page 136 Alliance of Nurses for Healthy EnvironmentsThe American Nurses Association Principles of 
Environmental Health for Nursing Practice were based 
on a Foundation of Principles including (among 
them):Human health is linked to the quality of the 
environment. 
•A healthy environment is a universal need and 
fundamental human right. 
•Current generations should meet their needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
•Pollution prevention should occur at its source. The concern of nurses is the promotion, maintenance, and restoration of people’s health. 
•Nurses have an obligation to address health disparities and environmental injustice. The nurse collaborates with other professionals, policy makers, advocacy groups, and the public in promoting local, state, national, and international efforts to meet health needs.

There are two main categories of non-ionizing EMF’s of 
scienti ﬁc research conducted to identify possible 
biological and environmental effects for over four decades.
•Magnetic Field Extremely Low Frequency (ELF-EMFs)- which are generated anywhere electricity ﬂows such as 
powerlines, electrical wiring and charging cords. 
•Radiofrequency (RF- EMFs) - also known as Radiofrequency Radiation (RFR) -which are the data/information carrying waves of cell phones and wireless networks (Moon, 2020). 
In this chapter, unless otherwise noted, the acronym “EMF refers to both ELF and RFF . 
WHY ARE EMF EXPOSURES IMPORTANT?
A large and increasing body of research in both human 
and animal studies have found that even legally allowed low level exposures are linked to a myriad of harmful biological effects including cancer, DNA damage and impacts to reproduction, nervous system and brain development (Bandara & Carpenter, 2018). The effects of new technology on human health are challenging to study because there is no unexposed control group in humans (Russell, 2018.) 
SOURCES OF EMF EXPOSURES 
Home and School Exposures 
People are directly and indirectly 
exposed to EMFs from cell phones, computers, smart electronics and the myriad of Wi-Fi networks in their homes, workplaces and schools (see table 1). The use of wireless electronics by every age group continues to increase each year (Common Sense Media, 2019). Many school districts have robust Wi-Fi networks and students now use computers in school and at home for hours a day. 
The use of electronics close to the 
body -e.g. laptops on laps, cell phones carried in a pocket or bra- create two kinds of intense EMF exposures to the body part closest to the device- RF from the wireless and ELF from the electricity. In addition, ELF exposures are elevated near charging cell phones, appliances, and electronics (Behrens et al., 2004).Occupational Exposures 
Cell phones, and wireless networks are common in 
today’s workplace -e.g. in hospitals, schools, retail, transportation and numerous industries. There is a critical need to gather health data on these exposures (Stam, 2021). For example, many delivery drivers use cell phones and tablets to track packages and hospital workers often have a cell phone in their pocket, a walkie talkie clipped to their chest, and they use numerous wireless devices over the course of one day. 
Cell tower/antenna maintenance workers, physical 
therapists using diathermy, and operators of dielectric welders have elevated EMF exposures. The latter two directly use high frequency EMFs to generate heat produced by EMFs (Aniołczyk et al., 2015). Overexposure has been documented to induced central nervous system demyelinating disease mimicking Multiple Sclerosis (Raefsky et al., 2020). Although U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) scientists developed recommendations to reduce EMF , they were never implemented (Bowman, 2016). 
Environmental Exposures
Environmental exposures to non-ionizing EMFs have 
dramatically increased over the last few decades (Bandara& Carpenter, 2018). People who live near high voltage powerlines and substations may have elevated ELF-

EMF throughout their home (Gagsek et al., 2013, Amoon 
et al., 2020). 
Cell tower networks are a signiﬁcant source of a person’s daily RF-EMF exposure, especially in urban areas (Sagar et al., 2018). Cell tower RF-EMF penetrates into homes, especially through windows facing the beam of a nearby wireless antenna (Hardell et al., 2018). The newest generations of wireless - 4G and 5G- will increase RF-EMF as these networks consist of thousands of new “small” cell towers built closer to homes (El Hajj and Naous, 2020, Mzloum et al., 2019).     It is   estimated that 800,000 new 
cell towers will be needed in the U.S. (Shepardson, 2018).   
Researchers caution that increasing cell antennas closer to the ground, close to homes and schools will increase ambient RF exposures to people (Frank 2021, Koppel et al 2022, Pearce 2020). WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO HEALTH EFFECTS OF EMFS? Children
When cell phones ﬁrst came on the market, no one could 
imagine the need for a child to use one. Now they are a favorite toy and used as babysitters. Children are uniquely vulnerable to EMFs just as they are to other environmental toxins. As wireless technology is now ubiquitous, children will receive a greater cumulative exposure than today’s adults, with exposure starting before they are born (Miller et al., 2019). Both their ongoing physical development and physiology put them at greater risk. 
•Children absorb proportionally higher doses of cell phone RF-EMF in the eyes and critical brain regions than adults due to their smaller heads, thinner undeveloped skulls and the higher water content in both their bodies and brain (Fernandez et al., 2018).

•Children’s developing brains are more susceptible to 
neurotoxic exposures (Redmayne and Johansson, 2014 and 2015).
•Children have more active stem cells and stem cells have been found to be more sensitive to RF-EMF exposure (Markova et al., 2010).
•Safety limits for RF-EMF from cell phones and cell towers are outdated as they were set over two decades ago in 1996 and are based on the body of a large adult, not a child (Gandhi et al., 2012). 
Researchers at Penn State Medical Center found reducing EMFs improved health outcomes in preterm infants (Passi et al., 2017). NICU equipment is linked to various impacts to the autonomic nervous system including melatonin production and heart rate and a 2017 review concluded that incubators should be redesigned to reduce exposure to the babies and caregivers (Bellieni et al., 2017). Pregnancy
As with other environmental toxins, the developing fetus 
is particularly sensitive to exposure during critical developmental windows. Although more research needs to be done to fully understand the risk during windows of vulnerability, research on pregnant women has linked prenatal cell phone radiation exposure to oxidative stress and DNA damage in cord blood (Bektas et al., 2021); increased risk for miscarriage (Mahmoudabadi et al., 2015), lower birth weight (Lu et al., 2017), fetal growth impacts (Boileau et al., 2020), and preterm birth (Tsarna et al., 2019); as well as emotional/behavioral problems (Divan et al., 2012, Sudan et al., 2016) and hyperactivity (Birks et al., 2017) in their children. Animal studies have linked prenatal wireless exposure to DNA damage (Smith-Roe et al., 2020), brain damage (Tan et al., 2017), memory problems (Shahin et al., 2018) and hyperactivity (Aldad et al., 2012). 
A Kaiser Foundation Research Institute team took measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld ELF-EMF exposure of 
pregnant women and followed their pregnancies and subsequent birth and health of their children over time. They published a series of studies documenting links between higher prenatal magnetic ﬁeld exposure (ELF-
EMF) and miscarriage (Li et al., 2017) as well as ADHD (Li et al., 2020), obesity (Li et al., 2012), and asthma (Li et al., 2011) in children exposed prenatally.

PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
Oxidative Stress and Preexisting Conditions
Reviews of animal and cell studies consistently ﬁnd even 
very low EMF exposure associated with increased 
oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays a role in the development of many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, immune and neurodegenerative syndromes. The young, old and/or medically compromised individuals, whose immune system and defense mechanisms are already compromised, are more likely to experience health effects from the increased oxidative stress (Yakymenko et al., 2015, Schuermann & Mevissen, 2021). 
Cancer 
Researchers have long studied EMFs for their relationship to causation. In 2002, magnetic ﬁeld ELF-EMF was 
classiﬁed by the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer (WHO/IARC) as a Group

2B possible carcinogen due to research ﬁndings that 
showed a relationship between residential exposure and 
increased childhood leukemia risk (WHO/IARC 2002). This association continues to be reported in more recent studies (Carpenter 2019, Seomun et al., 2021).
In 2011, the WHO/IARC concluded that wireless radiofrequency radiation (RF-EMF) was a Group 2B possible carcinogen largely based on studies of long term cell phone users with increased tumors-glioblastomas and acoustic neuromas (WHO/ IARC 2011). Several international experts conclude RF-EMF is a proven Group 1 human carcinogen (Miller et al., 2018, Peleg et al., 2018 Carlberg and Hardell 2017, Belpomme et al., 2018). 
Examples of new scienti ﬁc research that ﬁnds a 
carcinogenic effect for RF-EMF include:
•Two major animal studies investigating long-term exposure found the same tumors as found in human studies (U.S. National T oxicology Program, 2018, Falcioni et al., 2018). 
•A 2020 meta-analysis linked cumulative cell phone use over 1000 hours increased tumor risk (Choi et al., 2020). 
•Studies have found women who carry cellphones in the bra have elevated breast cancer risk (West et al., 2013, Shih et al., 2020). 
•A Yale study funded by the American Cancer Society found elevated thyroid cancer risk in heavy cell phone users with speciﬁc genetic susceptibilities (Luo et al., 2020). 
Reproduction
Systematic reviews associate RF-EMF with impacts to 
sperm (Kim et al., 2021, Yu et al., 2021) and decreased testosterone (Maluin et al., 2021) leading many researchers to conclude “it is recommended to keep the cell phone away from the pelvis as much as possible” (Hassanzadeh-Taheri et al., 2021).  Nervous System Impacts 
The nervous system is sensitive to EMFs (Bertagna et al., 
2021). Cell phone radiation has been found to alter brain activity (Volkow et al., 2011, Bin et al., 2014), impact neurotransmitters and alter neuron development (Kaplan et al., 2015, Li et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2021). T eenagers were found to experience memory damage to the area of the brain most exposed to cell phone radiation after just one year (Foerster et al., 2018).
 Experimental animal research has found a variety of RF-
EMF impacts especially in the brain regions critical to memory and learning (Sonmez, et al., 2010, Dasdag et al., 2015, Shahin et al., 2018, Obajuluwa et al., 2017, Tan et al., 2021, Hasan et al., 2021). 
Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity
In 2021, scientists published a consensus statement calling 
for the acknowledgement of electrohypersensitivity as a distinct neuropathological disorder (Belpomme et al., 2021) and exposure to non-ionizing radiation has a series of ICD 10 codes. 
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is characterized by 
the development of numerous symptoms linked to EMF exposure including: headaches, sleeping problems, concentration problems, nosebleeds, unexplained skin rashes, digestive problems, neurological problems, heart palpitations and disabling fatigue (Belyaev et al., 2016). 
Synergistic Effects
EMFs can add to our total body burden of carcinogens. 
Research has found that EMF exposure can act synergistically with other environmental pollutants potentiating harmful effects (Kostoff and Lau, 2017). For example, prenatal and postnatal mobile phone exposure has been linked to greater neurobehavioral effects in children with elevated lead levels (Choi et al., 2017, Byun et al., 2017). 
It is challenging to isolate an association epidemiologically 
because there is no unexposed control group (Russell, 2018.) Scientists must therefore rely on animal experiments which are carefully controlled to understand if the effects are caused by the exposure. 
Animal studies have found combining ELF-EMF exposure 
with known carcinogens can increase tumors (Soffritti et al., 2016, Soffritti et al., 2016). EMFs can increase permeability of the blood brain barrier, thus, allowing more toxic agents to reach the brain (Sirav and Seyhan, 2016, Tang et al., 2015).
EMFs and the Environment
There are reports that the proliferation of cell antennas 
will have numerous environmental effects. Analysis are accumulating that electricity and energy consumption of 5G and new wireless networks will contribute to greenhouse gasses and exacerbate climate change (The Shift Project, 2019, Williams et al, 2022).

Further, trees are critical to a healthy environment. They 
ﬁlter toxic chemicals from the air, reduce ground-level ozone and absorb carbon dioxide emissions that are driving climate change (T erzaghi et al., 2020, Bastin et al., 2019). There are studies ﬁnding that cell antenna RF- EMF 
can injure trees (Waldmann-Selsam, C., et al., 2016, Breunig, 2017, Haggerty, 2010) and impact plant growth (Halgamuge, 2017, Pall, 2016). 
A 2021 research review on effects to wildlife published in Reviews on Environmental Health references more than 1,200 scientiﬁc references which found impacts to wildlife, including pollinators, from even very low intensities of non-ionizing EMFs including impacts to orientation and migration, reproduction, mating, nest, den building and survivorship (Levitt et al., 2021a, b, c). The authors assert that the current body of science should trigger urgent protective regulatory action to protect wildlife. 
A COMPLEX SCIENCE WITH LIMITED PROTECTIVE FEDERAL REGULATION AND HEAVY INDUSTRY INFLUENCE 
U.S. and international scientists are calling for an update to the 1996 federal regulations and the need for independent research reviews in order to ensure the public is protected (Hardell & Carlberg, 2020). Similar to other environmental pollutants, literature reviews show conﬂicting results and industry funding has long been found to inﬂuence the results both in ELF and RF research (Hardell et al., 2006, Carpenter 2019, Huss et al., 2017). The of ﬁcial reports of many authorities have been 
criticized as having major conﬂicts of interest (Hardell 2017, Buchner & Rivasi, 2020). 
The book,   “Captured Agency” (Alster, 2015) identiﬁed   a 
“revolving door” between industry, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission. The investigation compared the tactics of the wireless industry to Big T obacco citing the heavy industry lobbying, the funding of science that shows no effect and the massive public relations campaigns designed to attack the credibility of the science and of scientists who do ﬁnd harmful effects. 
U.S. Policy 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
established human exposure limits for cell phones and cellular network RF-EMF in 1996 and they have not been updated despite the dramatic changes in wireless communications in the last 25 years. The FCC is not a health agency and does not have medical or public health experts on staff. In 2021, a federal court ruled that the FCC needed to reexamine their decision to retain the 1996 limits (No. 20-1025, 2021). T o date, governmental health and environmental agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Health and Human Services and National Cancer Institutes have not reviewed the totality of the latest science on health effects of EMFs. 
In 2018, the U.S. National T oxicology Program (NTP) found “clear evidence of cancer” and DNA damage in a large-scale animal study designed to evaluate the effects of long term exposure to radio frequency radiation from cell phones   (U.S. National T oxicology Program, 2018). 
Although the FDA requested the studies, they rejected the study conclusions. Research analyzing the NTP ﬁndings 
conclude U.S safety limits need to be strengthened by 200 to 400 times to protect children according to current risk assessment guidelines (Uche & Naidenko ., 2021).  
The American Academy of Pediatrics has long recommended that FCC limits be updated to protect children and pregnant women (AAP , 2012 & 2013). In addition, cell phones and electronics are not tested the way people use devices today- in body contact positions. Although it is now commonplace to see children watching videos with a cell phones pressed against their chest, research has found that when phones are tested for exposure levels in body contact positions, they can exceed government limits up to 11 times the FCC limit (Gandhi, 2019). Pregnant women rest cell phones laptops on their abdomens, and research ﬁnds these positions create RF-
EMF exposures into the fetal brain (Cabot et al., 2014) and can induce ELF-EMF in the fetus Bellieni et al., 2012).
Magnetic and ELF Safety Limits
The United States has no federal safety limit for magnetic ﬁelds or ELF-EMF . In contrast, over a dozen countries have some level of protective policy in place and they limit building homes in areas with magnetic ﬁeld levels higher 
than the levels associated with childhood leukemia (Stam, 2018). 
State and Local Policies
In the US, many states and localities have enacted laws 
related to Cell/T ower/Antenna placement. Physicians for Safe T echnology and the Environmental Health Trust track state legislation and local ordinances. In 2020, the New Hampshire State Commission on 5G issued 15 r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s w h i c h i n c l u d e d s e v e r a l recommendations including large setbacks to distance cell antennas from homes and schools, replacing Wi-Fi with wired in schools and a public health campaign to educate families. 
Page 141 Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments
Unit III: Environmental Health Sciences
International Policies and Actions
Internationally governments have policies and regulations 
in place to inform the public and reduce exposures. Numerous scientists, medical and public health professionals have issued appeals and recommendations on the need to reduce exposure to electromagnetic radiation and pause the proliferation of new untested networks (EMF Scientists Appeal, 2015, Di Ciaula, 2018, Mallery-Blythe, 2020, Nyberg & Hardell, 2017)
•Switzerland, Italy, China, Russia, India, Israel and several European countries have far more stringent cell tower radiation emission limits compared to the US FCC and many de ﬁne homes, schools and kindergartens as 
“sensitive areas” (Stam, 2017). 
•Over a dozen countries have clear recommendations that people reduce exposure to cell phone radiation, especially for children (Redmayne, 2016, EHT, 2021). 
•France has several policies including: limiting Wi-Fi in classrooms, banning the sale of cell phones designed for young children, banning advertisements aimed at children under 14 years old. Consumers are informed with instructions to use speakerphone, limit children’s use and “keep away from the belly of pregnant women and lower abdomen of adolescents.”
•Cyprus and French Polynesia have multimedia public education campaigns (EHT, 2021). •A major hospital in Cyprus removed Wi-Fi from the pediatric Intensive Care Unit and Neonatal units (Cyprus Committee on Environment and Children’s Health, 2019). 
 IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE 
In 1992, the International Council of Nurses made 
environmental health, preventing illness by eliminating environmental toxins a priority (as cited in ANA’s Principles of Environmental Health for Nursing Practice with Implementation Strategies 2007). Nurses can protect human health and the environment through prevention, clinical practice, and advocacy. 
Prevention
Nurses are trusted advisors. Nurses must ﬁrst protect 
themselves and their families, their patients, and their 
communities by learning how to decrease exposures to EMFs. Small lifestyle changes can signiﬁcantly reduce cellular damage of our total lifetime exposure. We can then educate our patients- especially parents and vulnerable populations. Nurses can work in coalition with other groups to educate why and how to reduce EMF exposures in the workplace, schools, and communities. People need to know how to eliminate unnecessary sources of EMFs and choose safe alternatives. Tips and checklists follow.

Clinical Practice
Nurses can integrate their understanding of EMFs into 
their clinical practice and include interview questions about technology use and EMF exposure in their assessments. When patients present with EHS symptoms, such as headache, insomnia, irritability, they should be further assessed for EMF sensitivity.

Phone Radiation Recommendations 
•Prefer texting to voice calls
•Use cell phones in speaker mode or hands-free. 
•Hold cell phone at a distance from head. 
•Make only short or essential calls on cell phones.
•Avoid carrying your phone against the body like in a pocket, sock, or bra. 
•Do not talk on the phone or text while driving. 
•If you plan to watch a movie on your device, download it ﬁrst, then switch to airplane mode while 
you watch in order to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.
•Minimize use in areas of low signal (i.e. how many bars you have). The weaker your cell signal, the harder your phone has to work and the more radiation it gives off. 
•Avoid making calls in cars, elevators, trains, and buses. The cell phone works harder to get a signal through metal, so the power level increases.
•Remember that cell phones are not toys or teething items.

ADVOCACY
Protecting Health Requires Nurses T o Be Advocates for 
Systematic Policy Change
Just as with other environmental issues, nurses have a 
responsibility to act to protect individuals and communities by supporting meaningful policy change. 
Nurses bring credibility on health issues to advocacy and 
our voices are important in developing protective policy.Working in coalition with other organizations always strengthens the message (e.g parent groups, environmental organizations, faith-based organizations, etc.). 
•Nursing organizations can adopt resolutions or policy positions on wireless and EMF exposures. See the resolution of the California Medical Association. 
•Nurses can join “safe tech” organizations and coalitions to support policies that reduce EMF exposures in our workplaces, schools, and communities. These include the citing of small cell antennas in neighborhood and sensitive areas and advocate for wired internet connection to and into the building: FASTER, SAFER, RELIABLE, and if it is a municipal/community partnership, it will eliminate the digital divide. Learn more at: SafeG.net
•Nurses and nursing organizations ﬁghting climate change 
can lobby elected ofﬁcials to take into account the carbon footprint of wireless technology. Download Environmental Health Trust’s Fact sheet on 5G and Climate Change which describes research showing escalating energy consumption from 5G networks. 
•As environmental health advocates, nurses can educate and work with schools, parents, teachers, and unions to reduce EMF exposures in schools, replace Wi-Fi with wired internet connections and ensure cell towers are not built near schools or daycare centers.
