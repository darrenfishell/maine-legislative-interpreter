I would like to support this bill as an important opportunity to study RF radiation's 
impact on living things. My daughter passed away of leukemia in neighboring 
Massachusetts and one of the questions I was asked by a research institution 
following her death is "how much exposure to RF radiation did you have while 
pregnant." We know RF is classified by the WHO as a Class 2B possible carcinogen. 
Further study is needed. I repeat, further study is needed. Thanks to Rep. Quint for 
protecting citizens when the Federal government refuses to update its standards, 
ignoring their duty of care to U.S. residents.
