As a licensed radio amateur, call sign WA1KLI, and citizen of the State of Maine, I 
would urge the committee to include language in any bill to specifically exclude the 
amateur radio service. I am a volunteer with the Franklin County EMA and my ability
to serve as a radio amateur radio operator could be adversely affected if this bill were 
to pass as written.
