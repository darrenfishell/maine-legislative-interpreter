Testimony in Opposition of H.P. 466/LD-697
SUBMITTED BY: John Oakes, Chief Radio officer for Lincoln County RACES.
The text of HP 466/LD-697 could be interpreted to include the Amateur Radio 
Service as well as other emergency communications that we rely on to manage 
disasters, threats and events in our communities. RF exposure evaluations are already 
required by the FCC and every licensed radio operator knows how to conduct one. 
Please consider the public service that the 4,500 amateur radio operators contribute 
here in Maine.
Sincerely,
John Oakes WC1G
