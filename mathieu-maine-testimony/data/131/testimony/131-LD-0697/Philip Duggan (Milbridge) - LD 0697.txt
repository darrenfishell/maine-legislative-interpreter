Testimony in opposition of H.P. 466/LD-697 – RESOLVE TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF 5G TECHNOLOGY ON BIRD, BEE, AND INSECT POPULATIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM EXPOSURE ON CHILDREN SUBMITTED BY: Philip Duggan, Amateur Radio Station N1EP, President, Maine Ham Radio Society; Maine Section Manager, ARRL  the national association for amateur radio.The wording in the text of HP 466/LD-697 could be interpreted to include the Amateur Radio Service, and other communications services that use “radio frequency emissions.”  The Maine State Legislature issued a joint resolution in February, 2023 recognizing the public service that the 4,500 amateur (Ham) radio operators contribute here in Maine. They are crucial during times of emergency, and many licensed hams support their local and state Emergency Management Agencies.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already requires licensed amateur radio operators to conduct RF exposure evaluations on their ham radio systems when they are ﬁrst set up, and whenever they make a change, such as installation of new antennas.Over-the-air communications have been a norm for more than a century. First responders, military, commercial, private, and other agencies rely upon the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, including many of the frequency segments used by 3G, 5G, etc. If such RF emissions were severely regulated or limited more than they already are, it would be a disaster for local, state, and national communications and disaster preparedness.If any legislation is introduced into the Maine Legislature to restrict, prohibit, or otherwise regulate such emissions, the Amateur Radio Service and other public safety communications should be exempt. Please remember that the amateur radio service is protected by federal and Maine statute.
