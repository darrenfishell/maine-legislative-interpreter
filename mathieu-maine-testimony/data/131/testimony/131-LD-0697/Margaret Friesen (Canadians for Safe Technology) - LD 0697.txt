This updated white paper  includes a proposed amendment to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
1999, and clarifies that this proposal  specifically addressed  radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF -
EMR) in Bill S -5. It is an update of the February 2022 version  of “Protect Birds, Bees and Trees: Include 
Electromagnetic Radiation * in Canadian Environmental Protection Act  Amendments.  * Anthropogenic Non -
ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation .”  
The proposed range of radiofrequencies is consistent with “ Limits of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency 
Electromagnetic Energy in the Frequency Range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. Safety Code 6 (2015). ” Consumer and Clinical

6.1 Section 43 of the Act is amended by adding the following after the last definition in the section:  
“radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation” means:  
radiated  energy arising from accelerating electrical charges, having the form of electromagnetic 
waves and a s tream of photons, and in a vacuum  travels  at the speed of light. The rate of 
oscillation of the waves is in the range between 3 kilohertz (kHz) to 300 gig ahertz (GHz), which 
corresponds to the frequency of the non -sinusoidal radio waves typically used in radio 
communications.  
7 Section 44 of the Act is amended by adding the following after subsection (4):  
Radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation  
(5) The Ministers shall conduct research or studies relating to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation, 
methods related to its detection, methods to determine its actual or likely short -term or long -term effect 
on the environment and human health, and preventive , control and abatement measures to deal with it, 
and alternatives to it s use , to protect the environment and human health.

 Modernizing  the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and  
Ensuring the “Right to a Healthy Environment ” Must Address  
Anthropogenic† Radiofrequency  Electromagnetic Radiation‡ (RF-EMR)  
(“wireless radiation ”) 
Highlights  
• Flora and fauna, including insects and birds, can be affected  adversely by  radiofrequency  electromagnetic 
radiation (RF -EMR) used for wireless telecommunications  (“wireless radiation”) . Species ’ collapse lends 
urgency  to assess ment  and environmental protect ion from anthropogenic † RF-EMR . Canadian assessment 
and regulation focuses solely on human health.   
• Unlike toxic substances, RF-EMR from modern technologies is not addressed as a  risk to the environment 
under the Canadian Environmenta l Protection Act (CEPA ), or other national  laws.  
• Health Canada ’s Safety Code 6  “Limits  for human exposu re to radiofrequency  electromagnetic energy ” 
guideline s are implemented by Innovation, Science a nd Economic Development (ISED) to protect humans 
from  “established ,” adverse effects, specifically nerve stimulation  at lower frequencies  and over -heating  
of tissue  at frequencies for telecommunications . 
• In other species, b iological effects of wireless  radiation  have been identified  in all tax a that were 
adequately studied. Effects have been  observed  at ambient and low-intensity levels  of exposure , such as  
from  Wi-Fi and cell towers (base stations)  at a distance .  
• The dramatic worldwide decline of populations of birds, insects and other biota  makes this an urgent 
issue . According to scientists who specialize in this field, exposure to wireless radiation at ambient levels 
may well be a co-factor , along with pesticides , habitat loss  and climate change . 
• The rollout of novel technologies is increasing wireless radiation levels, as well as introducing frequencies 
and modulations  not previously  used .  
• Increasing numbers of  structures with multiple cellular network antennas (specifically designed to emit 
RF-EMR) are being installed across Canada, in urban , rural and wilderness areas. These antennas will 
support the operation of hundreds of thousands additional  small er antennas (e.g., 4G, 5G) being mounted 
on non-tower structures (e.g., street furniture, buildings, lamp -posts and other utility poles). At the same 
time, tens of thousands more telecommunications satellites are being launched  to emit RF -EMR .  
• Wireless radiation is clearly an environmental agent that is potentially  harmful, as a pollutant . Exposure to 
wireless radiation has serious implications for  biodiversity and ecosystem health . 
• Cumulative  and synergistic effects may occur with wireless radiation plus chemical substances.  
• We believe that the solution is for the federal government to begin  to systematically regulate 
anthropogenic  RF-EMR under provisions in an amended Canadian Environmental Protection Act . Such 
an approach will both modernize the Act and further support the key goal to establish a  “Right to a 
Healthy Environment” in CEPA.  
Protect fauna and flora, as well as human health,  by amending the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, 1999  to address  current gaps in the regulatory regime,  by making  
anthropogenic radiofrequency  electromagnetic radiation  (RF-EMR or “wireless radiation”) subject 
to research and  regulation  (see page 2) .

 1 Background  
Canadian society relies heavily on wireless communications . This requires extensive infrastructure  of large cell 
towers (base stations) and smaller antennas  (on buildings , utility poles  and other structures ) to enable 
communications with wireless devices  used by individuals, businesses and a diverse range of organi zations . In 
addition to the existing infrastructure, more and more new cellular antennas, big and small,  are being 
installed and are emitting  increasing levels of radiofrequency  electromagnetic  (“wireless”) radiation into the 
environment.  
Radiofrequency  is a non-ionizing range of electromagnetic radiation.  Unlike the well -recognized direct 
molecular damage  from  high -energy photons of ionizing radiation  (e.g. , x-rays) , the lower -energy photons of 
non-ionizing radiation have  been portrayed as  harmless at doses that do not cause excessive heating of tissue.  
There is convincing evidence , however,  that ongoing, lower intensities of wireless radiation can cause 
biological effects  via other mechanisms , with serious implications  for biodiversity and  ecosystem health.   
Health Canada  guidance (Safety Code 6) addresses  human exposure to radiofrequency  electromagnetic 
radiation  (RF-EMR) , and compliance with Safety Code 6 is  enforced by the Ministry of Innovation, Science and 
Economic Development (ISED) via Administrative Monetary Penalties.1 No Canadian policy or law is intended 
to protect  non-human species  from radiofrequency radiation . As described in Section 3.4  below, ISED 
regulations and criteria for devices, e quipment and antenna -siting for cell tower s all reference S afety Code 6 , 
intending to protect people  but not other  biota. ISED references the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
1999  (CEPA), whereas CEPA is silent on this topic.  
It is well documented in peer -reviewed scientific literature , however,  that wireless radiation used in 
telecommunications can cause  harmful biological effects , at ambient levels . An extensive, authoritative 
review published in 2021  stated :2 
Biological effects have been seen broadly across all taxa and frequencies at vanishingly low intensities 
comparable to today's ambient exposures. Broad wildlife effects have been seen on orientation and 
migration, food fin ding, reproduction, mating, nest and den building, territorial maintenance and 
defense, and longevity and survivorship. Cyto - and geno -toxic effects have been observed .  
Wireless radiation  on its own, or acting additively or synergistically  with chemical substances, can damage 
living tissues and genetic material, and cause inflammation, dysfunction, cancers and other effects.3,4,5

 2 The Canadian Environmental Protection Act  (CEPA ) is the Logical  Law for Regulating  
Anthropogenic Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Radiation  (RF-EMR)  
In our view, t he Canadian Environmental Protection Act  (CEPA )6 is the most  logical, effective statute for 
assess ment  and regulation of  this rapidly increasing  environmental agent . Bill S -5 Strengthening 
Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act ,7 introduced in the Senate on February 9th, 2022 , is an 
opportunity to enact  specific legislative provisions and enabling legislation to promulgate regulations that can 
be used to assess and regulate  the increasing amounts of anthropogenic RF-EMR emitted  by wireless 
telecommunications  devices and infrastructure . Of relevance , safer non -wireless alternative 
telecommunication technologies  using  fibre and wired connections are also faster, and more secure, reliable, 
resilient and energy efficient ,8 making these technologies the climate -wise options.  
2.1 Environmen t and Climate Change Canada is N ot Engaged ; Health Canada is N ot Required to 
Consult  
The mandate of Environment and Climate Change Canada ( ECCC ) is to be  “the lead department for a wide 
range of environmental issues” and includes “minimizing threats to Canadians and the ir environment from 
pollution.”9 That said, ECCC has no  responsibility or  program  to monitor, assess and protect the biosphere 
from anthropogenic RF-EMR  generated and used in telecommunications. In October 2021, ECCC  confirmed in 
a response to a n Environm ental Petition to the Auditor General10 that,  
“Environment and Climate Change Canada is not conducting research and monitoring activities on 
the potential impact of radiofrequency/microwave radiation exposure to biota to inform Health 
Canada or other regu latory organizations.”  Furthermore, ECCC  “is not examining energy and 
resources implications to sustainability and climate change from the use of vario us alternative 
technologies for telecommunications.”  
In response to the same petition, in reference to doubled exposure limits for frequencies to be used for 5G, 
Health Canada stated  that there is no legislative requirement for public notice and it  is not required to consult 
Canadians regarding “interpretati on” of radiation exposure limits  from wire less devices and infrastructure. 
New interpretations are expected  with the burgeoning “ Internet of Things ” and dense deployment of 4G/5G 
antennas in close proximity to living spaces . The petition response also stat ed that ISED (not the scientific 
authority) invited comment to improve  the new standard , following publication in the Gazette.

 2.2 History of Engagement re garding  the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , 1999  
In March 2016, the new federal Liberal government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fulfilled an election 
commitment to modernize CEPA by delegating to the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development (ENVI) the task of undertaking a 15 -month comprehensive review of CEPA.  
Five briefs submitted to the Standing Committee addressed biological harms associated with non-ionizing 
electromagnetic radiation  used for wireless connectivity , and recommended inclusion in CEPA .

In June 2017, the Standing Committee submitted its fina l report, Healthy Environment, Healthy Canadians, 
Healthy Economy: Strengthening the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999  11 to the House of 
Commons . The report included 87 recommendations such as: recognizing a right to a healthy environment, 
enhancing considerations of vulnerable populations, addressing cumulative impacts of substances, banning 
carcinogens and endocrine -disrupting chemicals (EDCs), strengthening transparency and public participation, 
improving the National Polluta nt Release Inventory, establishing a more transparent assessment process for 
new living modified organisms, adopting a reverse -onus  approach for substances of very high concern, adding 
a definition of “vulnerable populatio ns,” and requiring investigations into effects  of substances  on vulnerable 
populations as well as cumulative and synergistic effects  of multiple toxicants .   
Recommendation 62  addr essed electromagnetic radiation:  
The Committee recommends that … Environment and Climate Change Canada conduct  studies on the 
effects of electromagnetic radiation on biota … and report their findings back to the Committee.   
A complete response to the Standing Committee was published in June 2018,12 with the Minister of the 
Environment and Climate Change committing  to “work towards legislative amendments as soon as possible in 
future Parliamentary sessions. ” Included in the report was the following commitment:   
Environment and Climate Change Canada  is reviewing the scientific evidence provided to the 
Committee on the effects of electromagnetic radiation on biota.13

 No review by ECCC  has been made public , and with the response to Petition 456, we now know that there is 
no plan to do so .  
As detailed below, scientific evidence since the 2016  Standing Committee submissions  clearly demonstrates  
that anthropogenic RF-EMR  can be harmful to biota, and that this can have consequential cascading effects 
on biodiversity and ecosystem health . Flora and fauna  should be protected;  there is currently a gap in the 
Canadian  risk assessment and  regulatory regime  with regards to this  environmental toxicant . Inclusion of  
anthropogenic  RF-EMR  in CEPA c ould rectify this serious gap.  
Mandate letters  from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to both the Minister of Health and the Minister 
of Environment and Climate Change tabled in Decemb er 201914 included the expectation “to better protect 
people and the environment from toxins and other pollution, including by strengthening the  Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, 1999 .”  
The 2019 mandate letters did not , however,  include express requirements for the Ministers to address the 
effects of anthropogenic RF -EMR  on biota as part of their work.  Similarly,  the 2021 mandate letters15 failed to 
acknowledge the importance of addressing this key issue.  
2.3 Increasing Levels of Anthropo genic Radiofrequency  Electromagnetic Radiation (RF-EMR) 
Emissions  Have Been  Accel erating  Over Recent Decades  
Ambient levels of wireless radiation continue to increase. There are currently tens of thousands of cell 
tower s16 across Canada. The number  of cellular network antennas is increasing rapidly , as they are  installed 
on new and existing structures in urban, r ural and wilderness areas.  These can support the operation of 
hundreds of thousands more small 4G/5G antennas being mounted on non -tower structures (e.g., street 
furniture, buildings, lamp -posts and other utility poles). Of additional concern is the introd uction of novel 
technologies that use frequencies and modulations not previously widely used outdoors. At the same time, 
tens of thousands more telecommunications satellites are being launched  to transmit RF -EMR .17 
The medical journal The Lancet  published a concise summary of increases in radiation for wireless 
communications, mounting to many -fold greater levels than the natural background.18 Figure 1, reproduced 
with permission, illustrates how instantaneous exposures have mounted from the 1950s, through the 1980s 
and during the 2010s.  
Note that the scales are logarithmic – each increment is a 1,000 -fold increase. At 1 GHz, within a commonly 
used frequency range for cell tower antenna emissions, the levels in some areas had increased up to a 
quintillion t imes natural background levels (a quintillion is 1 with 18 zeros).

 2.4 Anthropogenic Non -ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation  Can Cause Adverse Biological Effects  
at Low Intensity Levels  
Non -ionizing electromagnetic radiation , which includes RF -EMR,  is lower energy than ionizing radiation (e.g., 
x-rays) and by definition does not carry sufficient energy to remove an electron from an atom. Early  animal 
and human experimentation  led to the hypothesis (favoured by industry, a nd implemented by Health Canada)  
that only excessive heating may cause biological harms (“thermal effects”). Evidence, presented here and in 
hundreds of peer -reviewed publications, demonstrates that RF-EMR  can cause harm at exceedingly  low 
exposure levels. A few of the mechanisms and harmful effects that have been demonstrated in the laboratory 
and measured in various organisms include oxidative stress, cellular and DNA damage  (including in 
insects) ,19,20,21 and effects on receptor proteins22 and channels  through cellular membranes23 with exposure to 
purportedly safe intensities of c ommon frequencies.  These effects may impact function and viability of 
organisms, and lead to cancers.3,4,5 
Non -ionizing radiation is a broad swath of the electromagnetic spectrum, from extremely low-frequency 
Schumann resonance  of the earth,  through anthropogenic radiation associated with a wide range of 
technologies, and also  that received from the sun , such as naturally occurring infrared, visible and ultraviolet 
light (on the nominal borderline of ionizing radiation). Global protection from ultraviolet light is implemented 
via CEPA , with restriction of atmospheric ozone -depleting substances  (ozone absorbs  solar  ultraviolet light) .  
All b iota evolved in an environment with much  lower intensity natural RF-EMR , because the Earth’ s 
atmosphere blocks much of this type of radiation. With  the addition of anthropogenic RF-EMR , peak levels 
today can be more than trillions of times higher than historically (Figure 1).  
3 Current Concerns  
3.1 A Tipping Point?  
Whether or not we sense electromagnetic radiation , electromagnetic interactions are intrinsic in  living 
tissues . Effects may be central to life processes , occurring at the level of cellular membranes,24 impacting 
nerves and diverse chemical reactions  within cells . As well, t he ce lls of all  life form s normally  communicate 
within and  among themselves  with  exquisitely low-intensity  electromagnetic  and chemical signaling . Ambient

 levels of anthropogenic RF-EMR  in some areas now exceed historical natural levels by more than trillions -fold 
and have reached a level where it interfer es with natural signaling. I t appears that some biota (e.g., insects) 
may have reached a “tipping point” for population -wide effects .  
3.2 Electromagnetic Radiofrequency Radiation (RF-EMR) as a F actor in  the Decline of Bird and 
Insect Populations  
Many bird and insect species  are in decline worldwide. Interference with  magnetoreception for navigation 
may be a contributing factor , as comprehensively reviewed  by Levitt et al. in three recent publications .2  
The scientific  literature  was also systematically  reviewed at the request of the European Parliamen t.25 An 
extract from the report  states  (emphasis added) :  
Dielectric heating due to RF -EMF  [radiofrequency  electromagnetic fields]  exposure of biological 
tissue is shown in all categories. … which in turn has biological effects such as a thermoregulatory 
response. This implies that there is al ways a level of RF -EMF power density that will cause 
biological effects,  referred to as thermal effects. Decoupling effects caused by elevated 
temperatures and the presence of RF -EMFs within biological tissue are major issues in this field of 
study.   
Conce rns that anthropogenic electromagnetic radiation  may be  a factor i n the decline of insect populations 
were  detailed  in 2021 .26 Due to insects’ size , resonance may result in greater heating, and insects have little 
capacity to thermo -regulate. Insect declines are widely recognized to present serious ecological as well as 
economic issues, because insects form the base of food chains, and pollination is essential for biodiversity and 
agriculture.  
Serious adverse effects  observed in animals and plants  in field and laboratory studies  are depicted in Figure  2, 
at exposure levels 50 to more than 2,000 times below Health Canada’s non -occupational human exposur e 
guideline  for radiofrequency radiation  power density  (Safety  Code 6) .27 The guideline levels range  from 2,000 
to 10,000 mW/m2 (2 to 10 W/m2) depending upon the frequency  (off the scale of Figure 2 ).

radiofrequency radiation  or telecommunications devices , although  a 2020 consultation33 undertaken by 
Health Canada  did. Cell tower siting  Client Procedures Circular CPC -2-0-0334 stipulates that in addition to 
requirements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act35 (now repealed; the Interpretation Act  would

other statutory requirements, such as those under the Canadi an Environmental Protection Act , 1999 , the 
Species at Risk Act , 200237 and the Migratory Birds Convent ion Act , 1994 ,38 as applicable . None of these Acts 
address effects  of RF-EMR  used in telecommunications .

accessible  only  to flora and non-human fauna , including  airspace  where animals fly .

 Interference with normal function of equipment is addressed in EMCAB -2 — Criteria for Resolution of 
Immunity Complaints Involving Fundamental Emissions of Radiocommunications Transmitter s,39 yet 
interference with normal functions of biota is not addressed in Canad a, to the best of our knowledge.  
The Canadi an federal policy  gap, omitting  consideration of effects on non -human species of radiation for 
wireless communications, parallels a similar gap in the USA. In August 2021 , the District of Columbia  Court of 
Appeals ruled that the Federal Communications Commi ssion (FCC) — the USA regulator for  cell tower a nd 
other wireless device radiofrequency emissions , to which Health Canada looks for guidance in setting its 
guidelines — had ignored a substantial body of knowledge  that had been  presented in submissions:40 “The 
Commission failed to provide a reasoned expl anation for its determination that its guidelines adequately 
protect against the harmful effects of exposure to radiofrequency radiation unrelated to cancer.” This is not to 
say that the C ourt agreed with FCC conclusions; merely that the FCC had acknowledg ed the issue of cancer  
while it did not consider numerous other effects, including  effects on fauna and flora . 
3.5 Climate Change and Broader Environmental Implications  
Energy consumption for wireless communications is a climate issue. Overall , greenhouse gas emissions 
related to information and communication technologies are estimated to be about 3% of global totals 
(aviation is 2%) .41 These estimates are uncertain as they are based on yet -to-be-attained industry 
commitments and shifts to “gree n” energy (that could divert potential capacity from other uses). 
Nevertheless, estimates reflect a significant contribution to climate  change of digital technologies, while fibre 
and wire connections offer many advantages, including energy efficiency.8  
Dense deployment of additional hundreds of thousands of cell network antennas across Canada for new 
technologies  (e.g., 5G), and the myriad other devices that manufacturers hope to sell  to Canadian consumers, 
means that much more hardware will be manufactured . Planned obsolescence of technologies ensures 
ongoing turnover of old for new ; devices that are no longer supported  are discarded and replaced.  As new 
tech nology is deployed , sun-setting of  3G disproportionately affects elderly and low -income individu als,42 and 
may affect home alarms and  medical devices, as well as navigation and aviation . Beyond risks of halting 
support of important, functional devices, and of associated e -waste , replacement entails  petrochemical and 
mineral resources , and associated mining and pollution.  
3.6 Safer Alternatives  for Telecommunications : Fibre Optic and Wired C onnections  
An assessment of telecommunications alternatives, considering “substitution” and “e ssentiality ,” would 
reveal that use of hard (fibre and wire) connections to transmit data requires less electricity than use of 
wireless infrastructure.  Fibre optic to the premises (FTTP) and wired  connections  through the premises 
(WTTP) would substantially reduce RF-EMR  used for wireless technologies . Networks with  the hard  
connections emit minimal  radiation and have the added, not insigni ficant benefits that fibre optic  connections

connections .8  
4 The Solution – Regulate Anthropogenic Electromagnetic Radiofrequency Radiation (RF-EMR) 
under provisions in an amended Canadian Environmental Protection Act  
4.1 A Protective Law to Address  Effects on  Environmental and Human Health  
Canada needs a law governing environmental hazards, exposures, risks, climate impli cations, and impacts for 
the protection of wildlife , indeed,  all organisms , from excessive exposures to anthropogenic RF-EMR . 
Determination of exposure limits must be transparent, based on  research,  high -quality scientific methodology 
including systematic scientific review , and public consultation . Once established, standards for ambient levels, 
emissions and exposures must be monitored, assessed and reported transparent ly, with en forcement of 
emission and cumulative exposure limits .  
4.2 Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Radiation (RF-EMF) as a Pollutant , and Closing the Gap  
CEPA  is an Act “ respecting  pollution prevention and protection of the environment and human health in order 
to contribute to sustainable development.”  Exposures to RF-EMR  are in open air  and indoors, as the radiation 
may travel through  solids  such as walls and windows .  
CEPA defines air pollution  as: “a condition of the air, arising wholly or partly from the presence in the air of any 
substance, that directly or indirectly  endangers the health, safety or welfare of humans;  interferes with the 
normal enjoyment of life or property;  endangers the health of animal life;  causes damage to plant life or to 
property; or degrades or alters, or forms part of a process of degradation or alteration of, an ecosystem to an 
extent that is detrimental to its use by humans, animals or plants.”  
Anthropogenic RF-EMR  meets all of these criteria. We propose that to close this gap in CEPA , to protect  the 
flora and fauna in all taxa – the foundation of natural ecosystems and agriculture , as well as human health  – 
that CEPA Section 44 be amended  to incorporate  anthropogenic RF-EMR  as a pollutant to be rigorously and 
transparently assessed, restricted  and monitored,  with enforcement  and r emedies . Decision -making should 
place priority on pollution prevention,  implement the principles of precaution , substitution  and essentiality , 
consider cumulative effects, and be informed by independent scientific  evaluation  and public consultation. It 
is expected that this would result in some frequency ranges being regulated with scientifically based  limits , 
and regulatory processes  to protect environmental  and human  health and to ensure Canadians’ “Right to a 
Healthy Environme nt.”  
We have a once -in-a-generation opportunity to  
include modern,  escalating, bioactive  radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation  (RF-EMR) in  
Canada’s flagship legislation protecting the environment and human health.  
 
Protect fauna and flora, as well as human health,  by amending the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, 1999  to address current gaps in the regulatory regime,  by making  
anthropogenic radiofrequency  electromagnetic radiation  (RF-EMR or “wireless radiation”) subject 
to research and r egulation (see page 2).

EXTRACT : Twelve nests (40%) located within 200  m of antennae never had chicks, while only one (3.3%) located 
further than 300  m had no chicks. The electric field intensity was higher on nests within 200  m (2.36  ± 0.82  V/m) than 
on nests further than 300  m (0.53  ± 0.82  V/m). Interesting behavioral observations of the white stork nesting sites 
located within 100  m of  one or several cell site antennae were carried out. These results are compatible with the 
possibility that microwaves are interfering with the reproduction of white storks and would corroborate the results of 
laboratory research by other authors.

EXTRACT : Under such an influence,  ants followed trails for only short distances, no longer arrived at marked areas 
and no longer orientated themselves to a source of alarm pheromone. Also when exposed to electromagnetic waves, 
ants became unable to return to their nest and recruit congene rs; therefore, the number of ants collecting food 
increases only slightly and slowly. After 180 h of exposure, their colonies deteriorated. Electromagnetic radiation 
obviously affects social insects’ behavior and physiology.

radio -frequency irradiating antennas.  Journal of Environmental Monitoring , 13(7), 1890.  
EXTRACT : The 24 h exposure … resulted in alanine accumulation in the plant cells, a  phenomenon we have previously 
shown to be a universal stress signal… A unique biological connection has thus been made between exposure to RF -
EMF and cell stress, in the vicinity of RF transmitting antennas.

Electromagnetic Radiation -Induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in HEK293 Cells.  Biological Trace Element 
Research , 194(2), 368 –378.  
EXTRACT : Our f indings show that EMR caused oxidative stress and apoptotic activation in HEK293 cells. Zn seems to 
have protective effects on the EMR by increasing SOD activity and bcl -2 immunopositivity, decreasing lipid 
peroxidation and caspas -3 immunopositivity.

cellular phone r adiation can either stimulate or depress early embryogenesis in Japanese quails depending on the 
duration of exposure.  International Journal of Radiation Biology , 89(9), 756 –763.  
EXTRACT : The lower duration of exposure led to a significant (p < 0.001) dec rease in a level of DNA strand breaks in 
cells of 38 -h embryos, while the higher duration of exposure resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) increase in DNA 
damage as compared to the control. CONCLUSION: Effects of GSM 900 MHz cellular phone radiation on ea rly 
embryogenesis can be either stimulating or deleterious depending on the duration of exposure .

frequency signals: behavioural response of ticks ( Dermacentor reticulatus ) in a 900 MHz electromagnetic field.  
Systematic and Applied Ac arology , 22(5), 683.  
EXTRACT : We found that exposure induces an immediate tick locomotor response manifested either in a previously 
unreported jerking movement of the whole body or in jerking of the first pair of legs. Overall, ticks exhibited 
Including Anthropogenic Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Radiation (RF -EMR)  in CEPA Amendments  Page 19 of 19 
 significant ly greater movement in the presence of the RF -EMF. Significant sex differences relative to RF -EMF 
exposure were observed in both response variables. In the presence of RF -EMF, body jerking by females was greater 
than in males and vice versa for leg jerks.

Electromagnetic radiation and behavioural response of ticks: an experimental test . Experimental and Applied 
Acarology , 75(1), 85 –95.  
EXTRACT : The RF -EMF exposure to 900 MHz induced a higher concentration of ticks on irradiated arm of RST 
[radiation -shielded tube] as opposed to the RF -EMF at 5000 MHz, which c aused an escape of ticks to the shielded 
arm… The projection of obtained results to the natural environment could help assess the risk of tick borne diseases 
and could be a tool of preventive medicine.

trees around mobile phone base stations.  The Science of the Total Environment , 572, 554 –569.  
EXTRACT : Statistical analysis demonstrated that electromagnetic radiation from mobile phone masts is harmful for 
trees. These results are consistent with the fact that damage afflicted on trees by mobile phone towers usually start 
on one side, extending to the wh ole tree over time.

and mutagenic effects of low intensity GSM 1800  MHz microwave radiation . Experimental Oncology , 40(4), 282 –
287.  
EXTRACT : RESULTS: The exposure of quail embryos before and during the incubation period to low intensity GSM 
1800  MHz has resulted in expre ssive statistically significant oxidative effects in embryonic cells, including damages of 
DNA … Finally, the exposure resulted in a significant, almost twice, increase of embryo mortality. CONCLUSION: The 
exposure of model biological system to low intensi ty GSM 1800  MHz MWR resulted in significant oxidative and 
mutagenic effects in exposed cells, and thus should be recognized as a significant risk factor for living cells.
