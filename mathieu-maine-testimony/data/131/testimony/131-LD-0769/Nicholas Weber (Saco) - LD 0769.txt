LD 769
I urge you to vote in favor of LD 769 to strengthen our voting rights in Maine. The 
people of Maine deserve more choices, less bureaucracy, and greater access to the 
political process. I urge you to vote in favor of LD 769. 
Plus the freedom to be able to represent a party that goes along with the ideas for 
individuals here in Maine, I might even think about someday running for a political 
office under the party I wish to represent to represent the peopleâ€™s economic and 
social freedoms to enforce the right of choice, not limitations against a party for short 
registered voters.
