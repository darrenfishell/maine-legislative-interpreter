Cory  Reynolds 
Republican Cory 
LD 1401
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. My Name is Cory 
Reynolds and I am in Opposition to LD-1401. and ask you to vote Ought Not to Pass, 
because it violates the right to free speech guaranteed in the Maine and United States 
Constitutions. 
The Government and Democratâ€™s need to stop trying to get rid of history and freedom
of speech. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
