TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE   
Ought Not to Pass – LD 1401   
An Act to Protect Officials and Participants at Sporting Events   
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON  
CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY  
April 18, 2023   
Senator Beebe -Center , Representative Salisbury , and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety , greetings. My name is Michael Kebede , 
and I am the Policy Counsel at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed to advan cing 
and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. Constitutions. On 
behalf of our members, we urge you to oppose  LD 1401 , because it violates the right to free speech 
guaranteed in the Maine and United States Constitutio ns.   
To make sure that public discussions and debate remain “uninhibited, robust, and widespread,” 
the First Amendment protects speech that is “vituperative, abusive, and inexact.” Watts v. United 
States , 394 U.S. 705, 708 (1969).  It is a bedrock princip le of freedom of speech that the government 
may not regulate speech because of a disapproval of the messages in the speech or the identity of the 
speaker , even if the speaker and their speech are widely considered objectionable  or offensive . See 
Police Dep t. of Chicago v. Mosely , 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972) (the government has “no power to restrict 
expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content”). Content -based 
restrictions on speech, such as the kind contemplated by this legislation , are presumptively 
unconstitutional.  Simon & Schuster v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Board , 502 U.S. 105, 115 
(1991).  
Speech can be lawfully restricted when the speech itself constitutes a form of violence (such as 
“incitement” or a “tr ue threat”). To constitute a “true threat,” the speech must “communicate a serious 
expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of 
individuals.” Virginia v. Black , 538 U.S. 343, 360 (2003). To constitute  “incitement,” the speech must 
be intended to bring about imminent lawless acts and be reasonably understood as being aimed at 
producing such acts. See Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969).  
  
 
It appears that this bill is aimed at protecting sporting officials and participants from speech 
that is threatening in some way. But, the categories of speech that may be validly punished are narrow 
and tightly defined . See Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire , 315  U.S. 568, 571 -72 (1942). The categories 
proposed by this bill are neither.  We urge you to vote ought not to pass.
