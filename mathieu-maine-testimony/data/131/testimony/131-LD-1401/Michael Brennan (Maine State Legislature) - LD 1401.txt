Testimony of Representative Michael Brennan introducing 
LD 1401, An Act to Protect Officials and Participants at Sporting Events 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. I am Michael Brennan, andI 
represent House District 115 , Which includes a portion of Portland. I am here to introduce LD 
1401, An Act to Protect Officials and Participants at Sporting Events for your consideration. 
This bill is very straightforward and simple. 
If a person directs allusive, profane, obscene or slanderous language at an ofﬁcial or participant 
at a sporting event, they could be cited for a civil offense resulting in a $100 ﬁne. 
As you can see from the attached article, it has become increasingly difﬁcult to recruit 
individuals to become officials for sports events. At least one of the contributing factors is the 
verbal abuse directed at the officials. 
This bill is a small but concrete step to address that problem and deserves your support. I might 
suggest that the committee consider adding some deﬁnition to “sporting events.” 
Thank you for your time and attention. 
District 115: Part of Portland
