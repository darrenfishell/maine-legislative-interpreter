Testimony of Megan Garratt -Reed, Executive Director of the Office of Affordable Health Care  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services  
LD 914 “An Act to Amend the Duties of the Office of Affordable Health Care ” 
March 21, 2023  
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry,  and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services , 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on the L.D. 914 , “An Act to Ame nd the Duties of the 
Office of Affordable Health Care. ” This legislation would add language to the authorizing statute  of the 
Office of Affordable Health Care to explicitly include  a duty to “analyze potential costs and savings of 
new and emerging technologies in health  care treatment .” The legislation was introduced at the 
recommendation of the Advisory Panel to Better Understand and Make Recommendations Regarding 
the Implications of Genome -editing Technology for the Citizens of the State . 
 
I appreciate the Advisory Council ’s work  on this topic,  and agree that n ew and emerging technologies 
have the potential to be either drivers of cost or a means of creating savings through the development 
of earl y interventions  that could avoid expenses associated with  longer -term treatment.  To the extent 
that these new t echnologies emerge and begin to impact the health system  or consumers , however, 
consideration of their cost and benefit would fall under the Office ’s existing  broad  responsibility to 
“analyz e barriers to affordable health care and coverage and develop for consideration by the legislative 
oversight committee proposals on potential methods to improve health care affordability and coverage 
for individuals and small businesses in the State .” Legislation to specifically direct the Office to examine 
specific services and their impact on the health system, including new technologies, removes  auto nomy 
from the Office to identify and highli ght the drivers of cost that are most significant and where the 
greatest opportunity for policy intervention exists. In ligh t of that, I oppose the passage of this bill  as an 
unnecessary  additional mandate for the Office of Affordable Health Care , although I welcome the 
Advisory  Council’s recommendation that the Office consider emerg ing technology and it s impact on 
patients, esp ecially those with rare disease s, as it undertak es its existing work .  
 
Should LD 914 pass , it will be necessary to include a fiscal note to ensure the Office is able to support 
dedicated analysis of the t opic, alo ngside its existing mandate to identify and a nalyze drivers of cost and 
quality .  
 
Thank you for your consideration,  
 
Meg Garratt -Reed, Executive Director  
Office of Affordable Health Care
