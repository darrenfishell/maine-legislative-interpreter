LD 1138 – An Act to Improve Work and Family Mobility by Altering and Removing Certain 
Requirements for Driver’s Licenses and Nondriver Iden�ﬁca�on Cards  
 
Senator Chipman, Representa�ve Willliams, members of the Commitee on Transporta�on, my name is Sally Suton, and I am a Policy Specialist with the New Mainers Resource Center, Portland Adult Educa�on. I am pleased to be speaking in support of LD 1138 – An Act to Improve Work and 
Family Mobility by Altering and Removing Certain Requirements for Driv er’s Licenses and 
Nondriver Iden�ﬁca�on Cards.  
 
In the 2021 -2022 school year, Portland Adult Educa�on had over 2,000 immigrant students from 71 countries enrolled in 
classes  – learning English, ge�ng their High School Diplomas, preparing for college , receiving career advising or 
par�cipa�ng in a workforce training program.  Although each of their paths may be a bit diﬀerent, p eople are all eager to 
establish themselves and to be able to support themselves and their families.  
 
We have seen that there are 3 maj or hurdles that people face as they try to access programs at Portland Adult Educa�on , 
par�cipate in a training program or further their educa�on  and ul�mately ﬁnd a job: transporta�on, housing and 
childcare. By providing more ﬂexibility in Maine st atute regarding the documents that someone must provide to obtain a 
driver’s license or Maine ID, as has already been done for more than half of the US popula�on, LD 1138 would help to 
remove a signiﬁcant b arrier  to transporta�on, housing and childcare .  
• Without reliable transporta�on ge�ng and maintaining employment are almost impossible. Public 
transporta�on, even when it is available can be quite limi�ng in terms of where and when someone is able to obtain a job. And, for most of the state, pub lic transporta�on is not even an op�on. By removing some 
unnecessarily strict requirements to obtain ing a driver’s license, LD 1138 expands the job opportuni�es that 
someone might pursue . It also  beneﬁts employers who may be struggling to hire the workers  that they need 
because their place of business is not on a bus line . Besides being able to get to work, just being able to do life’s 
daily ac�vi�es – buy groceries, go to medical appointments, take kids to  school , or help elderly parents with 
errands, e tc. - having a driver’s license makes ge�ng through life less stressful and so much more manageable.  
• We all know that housing  is one of the biggest challenges facing the state, and stable housing is cri�cal to ge�ng 
setled in a community – ge�ng c hildren into school, ﬁnding and retaining a job  - oﬃcial iden�ﬁca�on, such as a 
state ID or driver’s  license are required by many landlords for someone to even be considered for ren�ng a place 
to live. LD 1138 would remove this barrier  and make the challenge of ﬁnding housing a bit easier.   
• There is a shortage of childcare  in Maine, and for many parents, besides just ﬁnding good and aﬀordable 
childcare, they also need to worry about ge�ng their children to the childcare.  Having a driver’s licen se to be 
able to take children to and from daycare creates more ﬂexibility and op�ons for where a family may be able to ﬁnd daycare.   
 
For those of us who have had a license since we were 16 and driving all of our lives, it is almost impossible to thin k about 
how complicated and hard our lives would be if we could not drive, or if we had no  oﬃcial ID to show who we were. LD 
1138 is a common sense bill that has been passed and is working in many states all across the country. Shouldn’t we as a 
state take whatever measures we can to help those immigrants to Maine who just want to go to w ork or take care of 
their families, and do whatever we can to remove any unnecessary barriers?  I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 
1138.  Thank you.
