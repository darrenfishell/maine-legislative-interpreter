Testimony in Support of Legislative Document No. 1138, H.P. 724 
 
Goodwill Northern New England is a nonprofit social enterprise that helps people achieve their life and 
work goals. Our programs help people get the job training and develop the careers they need to support 
themselves and their families. Our model of service delivery is a robust team approach; these teams 
have specialized members who focus on each part of a person’s life, and they work together to provide 
a holistic approach to support. 
This work may include job training and career placements, health care supports that allow people to 
achieve their personal goals, and/or providing jobs directly through our retail and cleaning enterprises. 
Each year, we worked with more than 9,600 job seekers; last fiscal year, we helped 3,100 of them secure 
jobs.  
Many of the job seekers we support do not yet have a driver’s license or other form of identification. 
This is especially true for asylum seekers, who do not currently receive a photo ID in the form of a work 
permit for at least seven months. Virtually all the individuals we help to find jobs need to work as soon 
as possible.  
Goodwill NNE supports L.D. #1138, which removes the legal presence requirement to obtain a driver’s 
license or nondriver identification card, which in turn makes it possible for asylum seekers and others to 
begin their new lives with more employment options and the capacity to support their families more 
quickly. This is truly a win/win scenario for both the job seekers and for Maine.
