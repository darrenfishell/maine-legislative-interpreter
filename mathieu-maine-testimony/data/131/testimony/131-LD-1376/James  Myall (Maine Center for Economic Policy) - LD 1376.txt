Testimony in Support of  LD 1376, “ An Act to Create a Livable Wage by Increasing the Minimum Hourly Wage ” 
April  11, 2023  
James Myall, Economic Policy Analyst  
 
Good afternoon  Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing Committee  on Labor and 
Housing. My name is James Myall. I’m an Economic Policy Analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Policy. I’m here 
today to testify in support of  LD 1376, “An Act to Create a Livable Wage by Increasing the Minimum Hourly Wage .”  
Over the past few years, we’ve seen the benefits of a higher minimum wage. Increases to the state’s minimum wage 
since 2016 have produced positive impacts such as higher earnings, and a reduction  in child poverty, all while seeing – at 
least until onset of the COVID -19 pandemic – low unemployment rates and high labor force participation.  
While Maine’s current minimum wage law has resulted in demonstrable benefits for workers and our econo my as a 
whole, it falls short of guaranteeing a living wage for all Mainers . LD 1376  would build on our past success with minimum 
wage increases and move us closer to that goal of a living wage.  Measuring a living wage can be difficult because it 
depends o n which expenses are considered essential, and varies based on family size. One good  estimate comes from 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which says a living wage for a single adult working full -time in Maine is 
$16.53 per hour .1 Based on curren t estimates of inflation, the “living wage” for a single adult without children will be 
just under $23 per hour by 203 3 (Table 1) .2 LD 1376 would therefore bring Maine’s minimum wage into alignment with a 
basic living wage.  
It's important to note that while $24 per hour appears to be a big increase to the minimum wage, its implementation 
over 10 years means that its impact will be spread out over time. According to MECEP’s analysis, LD 1376 would increase 
wages for 245, 000 Mainers by 203 3, just under  40 percent of the state’s  employee  workforce.3 This is a more robust 
increase than the mini mum wage increase Mainers voted for in 2016, wh ich impacted a third of Maine’s workforce ,4 but 
of course that increase was phased in over 4 years rather than 10.  
One measure of t he impact of a minimum wage increase widely -recognized by economists is the ra tio between a 
proposed minimum wage and an are a’s median hourly wage for full -time, year -round workers. This is called the Kaitz 
Index.  Currently, Maine’s minimum wage is  53 percent of the median wage , and because it is indexed to inflation, it is 
predicte d to remain at 53 percent of the median wage indefinitely. LD 1376, on the other hand, would increase the wage 
to 72 percent of the median wage by 203 3 (Table 2) . This is  within the range of minimum wage increases in the US which 
have been studied and show n to have no statistically significant impact on employm ent.5  
However, it is worth examining the impacts on  lowest -wage labor markets  in the state . According to data from the US 
Census Bureau, th is is the area covered by Aroostook and Washington Counties,  where the  median hourly wage for full 
time employees in Northeast Maine is  currently  $22.21 per hour, compared to the statewide average of $26.06 per 
hour. By 203 3, we estimate  LD 1376 would bring the minimum wage from 62 percent of the median wage in tha t area to 
84 percent  (Table 3) . The most recent eviden ce suggests minimum wages at up to 8 2 percent of the median wage do not 
cause unemployment ,6 though there are not many examples of wages this high in the United States from which to draw 
conclusions. On this basis, LD 1376 as drafted might be feasible eve n in these areas of the state, but it is hard to say for 
certain.  
In general, we support LD 1376 as an effort to make Maine’s minimum wage closer to a livabl e wage, and to improve the 
well-being of hundreds of thousands of workers across the state. I urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1376 , while 
noting some areas for consideration as outlined above.  
Thank you. I’ll be happy to take any questions.
