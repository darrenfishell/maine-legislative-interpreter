RE: Testifying in Opposition , LD 1376, An Act to Create a Liv able Wage by Increasing the Minimum 
Hourly Wage  
My name is Eric Venturini,  and I am the Executive Director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine .  
The Wild Blueberry Commission works on behalf of 4851 wild blueberry farmer s and businesses  who 
grow wild blueberries on approximately 4 2,0002 acres across the state  and Passamaquoddy lands. 
Maine’s growers often produce crops exceeding 
100 million pounds and supply markets in Maine to 
California, and across the globe.  
Labor challenges have been on the top of the Wild 
Blueberry Commission of Maine’s priority list since 
2022, and in a series of three  grower listening 
sessions that we hosted across the State last year, 
producers consistently ranked “Addressing Labor 
Challenges,”  as their top priority.  
The Wild Blueberry Commission ha d not testified 
against minimum wage bills before this Committee 
this session. That is bec ause in our industry , 
farmers are already paying  market rates for starting 
wages, which are typically $15 to $20 per hou r. 
Conversations about State minimum wag es are, 
therefor e, often irrelevant . However, this bill would 
increase minimum wage far to o quickly for the 
market to bear . By 20 34, this bill would have the

State minimum wage at $24  per hour , or 1.75 x the $13.80 that it is today.  
In agriculture, the single source of income for most farm businesses is the  sale of the crop. In the wild 
blueberry industry, it’s the sale of wild blueberries. Most far mers sell their wild blueberries as a raw 
product , and as such, are price takers. Referring the graph above, t he farm gate price, or the price that 
producers receive  for wild blueberries  in 20 12 was $0.75 / pound. The most recently published wild 
blueberry farm gate price  (2021)  was also $0.75 / pound. Can a farmer pay a minimum wage of $24 / 
hour at a farm gate price of $ 0.75 / pound?  No, they cannot.  
Farm workers are , under current Maine law subject to the Federal mini mum wage , not the State 
minimum. However, if the State minimum is set at $24, very few farmers in Maine will be able to hire 
worker s at less than that , even if they are legally allowed to do so.  
I urge you to support Maine ’s small farmers as a vital sector of Maine ’s economy and vote Ou ght Not To 
Pass  on this bill. Thank you for your time.  
 
Sincerely,
