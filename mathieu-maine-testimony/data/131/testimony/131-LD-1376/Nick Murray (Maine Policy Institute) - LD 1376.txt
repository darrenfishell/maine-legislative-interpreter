Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1376,
“An
Act
to
Create
a
Livable
Wage
by
Increasing
the
Minimum
Hourly
Wage”
Senator
Tipping,
Representative
Roeder,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1376.
According
to
the
U.S.
Small
Business
Administration
(SBA),
more
than
99%
of
Maine
businesses
are
considered
small
businesses,
meaning
that
they
employ
less
than
500
employees.
1
These
firms
collectively
employ
more
than
56%
of
all
workers
in
Maine.
When
the
state
mandates
higher
costs
on
businesses,
consumers
and
workers
also
pay
the
cost.
Wage
controls
contribute
to
higher
costs
like
any
other
tax,
regulation,
or
mandate
would.
Minimum
wage
laws
have
simply
not
shown
to
benefit
workers
in
the
way
that
proponents
have
claimed
for
years.
Economic
research
has
shown
that
when
the
government
establishes
tighter
wage
restrictions,
workers’
hours
are
reduced,
consumers
pay
more,
or
jobs
are
ultimately
lost.

A
study
published
in
American
Economic
Journal
studied
the
effects
after
Seattle
set
its
citywide
minimum
wage
to
$13/hour
in
2017.
It
found
that
those
earning
less
than
$19/hour
saw
their
wages
rise
by
3.4%,
but
their
working
hours
decreased
by
7%.
The
low-wage
workers
who
were
employed
in
Washington
before
the
policy
went
into
effect
saw
their
wages
rise
more
than
their
hours
fell,
but
made
only
about
$12
more
per
week
on
average.
Researchers
found
a
lower
rate
of
hiring
for
the
low-wage
workers
who
were
not
previously
employed
in
the
state
before
the
new
citywide
minimum
wage.
3
Ultimately,
workers
lost
from
this
experiment.
When
wages
rise
artificially
due
to
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage,
payroll
costs
on
businesses
increase
without
compensation
for
growth
in
productivity
or
sales.

Proponents’
oft-stated
goal
of
a
national
$20/hour
minimum
wage,
would
be
disastrous
for
our
nation’s
economy.
An
analysis
published
by
the
nonprofit
Employment
Policies
Institute
(EPI),
based
on
a
2019
CBO
analysis,
found
that
the
policy
would
lead
to
2
million
jobs
lost
and
collectively
cost
businesses
over
$99
billion.
EPI
also
found
that
the
job
losses
would
hit
the
youngest
workers
(age
16-19)
the
hardest,
with
that
group
projected
to
lose
more
than
850,000
jobs.
In
Maine,
they
estimated
the
policy
would
cost
1,300
jobs
and
$90
million
in
increased
business
costs.
4
Obviously,
people
earning
higher
wages
is
a
good
thing.
This
is
why
we
at
Maine
Policy
are
constantly
advocating
for
less
state
intervention
and
lower
tax
burdens.
These
things
provide
for
a
vibrant
economy.
Allocation
of
resources,
including
human
capital,
is
much
better
accomplished
when
it
is
directed
by
markets,
not
government.
Unleashing
the
creative
potential
of
individuals
through
markets
and
free
enterprise
is
historically
the
quickest
and
most
efficient
way
to
raise
the
quality
of
life
for
everyone.
5
Short
of
eliminating
the
minimum
wage
entirely,
lawmakers
should
work
to
relax
some
of
its
most
stringent
requirements,
including
the
mandate
that
the
minimum
wage
increase
with
inflation
every
year.
Mainers
are
competing
in
a
regional,
national,
and
global
economy.
The
true
minimum
wage
is
zero
dollars,
not
whatever
number
legislators
place
in
statute.
Please
deem
LD
1376
“Ought
Not
To
Pass.”
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
