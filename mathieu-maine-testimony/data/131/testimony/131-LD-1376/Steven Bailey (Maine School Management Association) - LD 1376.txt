TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1376  
 
AN ACT TO CREATE A LIVABLE WAGE BY INCREASING THE MINIMUM HOURLY WAGE  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Committee on Labor and Housing. I am Steven 
Bailey, executive director of Maine Sch ool Management Association, testifying on behalf of the leg islative 
committees  of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents Assoc iation , in 
opposition to L .D. 1376.  
 
This bill sets the minimum wage at $ 15 per hour in 2024  and req uires it go up $1 per year , starting in 2025 
through 20 33, or by the increase in the cost of living, whichever is greater.  
 
By our estimates  the $1 pe r-year requirement would bring us to $25 per year in 10 years, for our employees 
who get an hourly rate. A s you know teacher salaries are negotiated, as well as wages for many education 
technicians IIIs.  
 
School districts are well aware of the competitive n ature of the current job market, which  is driving up hourly  
rates in parts of the state.  
 
We have particu lar concerns with a mandated hourly rate for school employees in our more rural districts . In 
those districts where our taxpayers are earning less than in urban districts, it could cause school budgets to 
fail. 
 
We also are concerned that this mandates a s ignificant cost driver in local school budgets. Those budgets are 
the purview of the local School Board and ultimately local taxpayers, whose tax ra tes would be affected.  
 
L.D. 1376 goes against local control and we urge its defeat.
