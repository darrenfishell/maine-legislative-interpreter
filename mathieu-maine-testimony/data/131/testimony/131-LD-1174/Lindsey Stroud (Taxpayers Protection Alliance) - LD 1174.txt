Testimony before the Maine Committee on Health and Human Services  
Regarding Banning the Sale of Flavored Tobacco and Vapor Products  
Lindsey Stroud, Director, Consumer Center  
Taxpayers Protection Alliance  
April 25, 2023  
Chairman Baldacci and Chairwomen Meyer and  Members of the Committee,  
Thank you for your time today to discuss banning flavors in tobacco and vapor products. My 
name is Lindsey Stroud and I’m Director of the  Consumer Center at the Taxpayers Protection 
Alliance (TPA ). TPA is a non -profit, non -partisan organization dedicated to educating the public 
through the research, analysis and dissemination of information on the government’s effects on 
the economy. TPA’s Consumer Center focuses on providing up -to-date information  on adult 
access to goods including alcohol, tobacco and vapor products, as well as regulatory policies that 
affect adult access to other consumer products, including harm reduction, technology, 
innovation, antitrust and privacy.  
While addressing youth use of age -restricted products is laudable, lawmakers must refrain from 
prohibitionist bans on products that may help adults quit smoking. Youth use of traditional 
tobacco products has reached record lows, while youth vaping has halv ed in recent years. 
Further, there is no evidence to support that banning flavors in tobacco and vapor products has 
led to further increases in youth use of such products , nor has it led to a significant decrease in 
youth and/or adult smoking rates. Rather  than imposing draconian bans that also do not take into 
consideration the reasons why youth use such products, policymakers should utilize existing 
tobacco monies to fund programs that will prevent youth use while adults quit smoking.  
• In 2021, only 5.5 p ercent of Maine high school students and 1.4 percent of middle school 
students reported current use of combustible cigarettes, which are some of lowest levels 
recorded.  
• Between 2019 and 2021, current use of vapor products decreased by 39.4 percent among 
high schoolers in the Pine Tree State and by 37.1 percent among middle schoolers.  
• Youth vaping has decreased by 53 percent between 2019 and 2022, while youth use of 
traditional tobacco products is at record lows.  
• Youths are not using e -cigarettes because of flavors. In 2021  (among middle and high 
school students that were currently using e -cigarettes ), 43.4 percent had used them 
because of feelings of anxiety, stress and/or depression, compared to 13.2 percent who 
had cited using them because of flavors.   
• In 2021, 5.8 percent of Maine adults reported past -month e -cigarette use, which was a 
41.5 percent increase from 2017.

• The introduction of e -cigarettes has not led to increases in cigarette smoking, but rather, 
correlates with significant declines in sm oking rates among young adults.  
• Between 2007 and 2018, smoking rates among Maine adults aged 18 to 24 years old 
declined by 49.8 percent. Since 2018, young adult smoking rates have decreased another 
56.3 percent, with average annual declines of 21.3 perce nt. 
• Maine’s vaping industry created $19.4 million in economic activity in 2021 while 
generating 241 direct vaping -related jobs and contributed more than $4 million in state 
taxes.  
• Flavored vapor bans correlated with increases in young adult smoking rates.  
• According to data from the CDC, smoking rates among young adults aged 18 to 24 years 
old decreased on average by 19.7 percent between 2020 and 2021. Yet, in three of the 
then-four states with active flavor bans, smoking rates increased.  
• Existing flavor bans have failed to significantly reduce vaping rates among youth. 
Between 2019 and 2021, current vapor product use among Massachusetts high school 
students decreased by 45 percent and in Rhode Island the percent of high schoolers 
currently using e -cigarettes decreased by 40.9 percent during the same period.  
• Comparatively, in New Hampshire, high school vapor product use declined by 52 percent 
during the same period, in Hawaii by 51.6  percent and in Connecticut high school vapor 
product rates decreased by 60.7 percent between 2019 and 2021.  
• Massachusetts’ menthol cigarette ban did not lead to significant reductions in adult rates. 
Between 2019 and 2021, adult smoking rates decreased by  12.4 percent in Massachusetts, 
while they decreased by 22.6 percent in New Hampshire.  
• New Hampshire also experienced a 28 percent increase in state cigarette excise tax 
revenue between 2019 and 2021 compared to Massachusetts which saw tax collections 
decrease by 20.5 percent.  
• Bans will only lead to loss revenue and illicit markets, as indicated in other states, and 
could cause consumers to be exposed to harmful substances.  
• Online marketplaces are already offering consumers banned flavored tobacco and vapor  
products. As these are unregulated, they can pose severe risks to consumers.  
• In New York City, one seller has an ad on Craigslist which offers flavored e -liquid. The 
seller also remarks that “[p]ersonal questions of [his] cost, date purchased, where 
purchased, why selling is no one’s concern.” In California, which recently banned the 
sale of flavored tobacco and vapor products, the “menthol man” is offering to deliver 
menthol cigarettes for $15 -a-pack in Sacramento.  
• Maine woefully underfunds programs to p revent youth use of tobacco and/or vapor 
products and help adults quit smoking, while simultaneously receiving millions of dollars 
from the pockets of the adults who smoke. In 2021, for every $1 the state received in 
tobacco monies, it spent only $0.08 on tobacco control efforts.

Youth Tobacco and Vapor Product Use  
Despite  headlines,  youth  use of traditional  tobacco  products  is at record  lows,  while  youth  e-
cigarette  use peaked  in 2019  and has steadily  declined  in the years  since.   
In 2021, accord ing to the Maine Integrated Healthy Youth Survey, only 17.6 percent  of high 
schoolers  and 9.3 percent  of middle schoolers  reported trying combustible cigarettes, including 
just one puff.1 Since 2009, ever cigarette use among middle schoolers has  declined by 50  
percent  and among  high schoolers by 56.9  percent . Current use, defined as having smoked a 
cigar ette on at least one occasion in the 30 days prior to the survey has also declined. Among 
high school students, only 5.5  percent  reported current cigarette smoking, a 68.8  percent  decline 
from 2009’s 17.6  percent . Among middle school students, current smok ing has decreased by 
73.6 percent , from 5.3  percent  in 2021 to 1.4  percent  in 2021.  
Youth use of vapor products has also declined. In 2021, 31.7  percent  of high school students had 
ever tried an e -cigarette and only 17.4  percent  were currently vaping. Amon g middle school 
students, only 10.2  percent  reported ever trying e -cigarettes and only 4.4  percent  were current e -
cigarette users.  
Similar to other states and national data, youth vaping seems to have peaked in Maine in 2019. 
That year,  45.1 percent  of hig h schoolers  had tried e -cigarettes, and 28.7  percent  were currently 
vaping. Between 2019 and 2021, ever -use of e -cigarettes declined by 29.7  percent  and current 
use by 39.4  percent . Among  middle school students  in 2019, 16.3  percent  reported trying vapor 
products and 7  percent  were currently vaping. Ever - and current use of vapor products declined 
by 37.4  percent  and 37.1  percent , respectively.  
According to the National Youth Tobacco Survey, youth vaping peaked in 2019 when one in five 
(20 percent) of youths were currently using e -cigarette products, defined as having had used the 
product on at least one occasion in the 30 days prior.2 In 2022, less than one in ten (9.4 percent) 
of youth reported current e -cigarette use, which is a 53 percent decline f rom 2019’s levels.  
In 2022, regarding traditional tobacco product use, 1.9 percent reported current use of cigarettes, 
1.6 percent had smoked a combustible cigarette and 1.3 percent were currently using smokeless 
tobacco. Given the reco rd lows in traditional tobacco product use, banning flavors are not 
necessary as youth are not overwhelmingly using these products.

Other  national  survey  data has found  significant  declines  in youth  use of tobacco  and vapor  
products.  In 2022,  according  to the Monitoring  the Future  Survey  (MTFS),  among  middle  and 
high school  students,  2.3 percent  reported  currently  using  smokeless  tobacco,  2.2 percent  
reported  current  combustible  cigarette  use, and 1.4 percent  reported  using  flavored  little cigars.3 
Again,  these  are some  of the lowest  levels  recorded.  In 2012,  more  than one in ten U.S. youth  
(11 percent)  reported  current  cigarette  use. In ten years,  smoking  rates  among  U.S. youth  
declined  by 78.7 percent.  During  the same  period  smokeless  tobacco  use among  youth  decreased  
by 59.6 percent.  Between  2014  and 2022,  the percent  of youth  reporting  current  use of flavored  
cigars  declined  by 81.2 percent.   
Similar  to the NYTS,  the MTFS  also found  that youth  vaping  peaked  in 2019,  when  22.7 percent  
of U.S. youth  reported  “any vaping”  – i.e., using  a vapor  product  to vape  either  nicotine  or other  
substances.   Between  2019  and 2022,  the percent  of youths  reporting  any vaping decreased  by 
23.9 percent.

Given  the significant  reductions  in youth  use of vapor  products,  as well as historic  low use of 
traditional  tobacco  products,  lawmakers  must  refrain  from  prohibitionist  policies  that fail to 
consider  these  reductions.  
Youths Are Self -Medicating, Not Using Vapes Because of Flavors  
While lawmakers tout the number of youth that are using e -cigarettes, they fail to listen to the 
data on why youth using these products.  
According to the 2021 NYTS, among middle and high school s tudents that reported current e -
cigarette use, 43.4 percent cited using them because they were “feeling anxious, stressed, or 
depressed,” compared to only 13.2 percent who cited using them because they were available in 
flavors.  
Among students that report ed having ever tried an e -cigarette, 57.8 percent cited using them 
because a friend uses them, compared to 13.5 percent who cited the availability of flavors.

This is similar to data from state surveys.  
In 2019,  among  all Connecticut  high school  students,  5.2 percent  reported  using  e-cigarettes  
because  of “flavors,”  18.2 percent  cited  “other,”  and 12.9 percent  reported  using  e-cigarettes  
because  of friends  and/or  family.4 
In 2017,  among  Hawaiian  high school  students  that had ever used e-cigarette s, 26.4 percent  cited  
flavors  as a reason  for e-cigarette  use, compared  to 38.9 percent  that reported  “other.”5 
Among  highschoolers  in Maryland  that used e-cigarettes,  when  asked  about  the “main  reason”  
for using  e-cigarettes  only 3.2 percent  responded  “flavors.” 6 Conversely,  13 percent  reported  
because  “friend/family  used them,”  11.7 percent  reported  “other,”  and 3.8 percent  reported  using  
e-cigarettes  because  they were  less harmful  than other  tobacco  products.   
In 2019  (among  all Montana  high school  students ), only 7 percent  reported  using  vapor  products  
because  of flavors,  compared  to 13.5 percent  that reported  using  e-cigarettes  because  of “friend  
or family  member  used them.”7 Further,  25.9 percent  of Montana  high school  students  reported  
using  vapor  products  for “some  other  reason.”

In 2019,  among  all students,  only 4.5 percent  of Rhode  Island  high school  students  claimed  to 
have  used e-cigarettes  because  they were  available  in flavors,  while  12.5 cited  the influence  of a 
friend  and/or  family  member  who used them  and 15.9 percent  reported  using  e-cigarettes  “for 
some  other  reason.”8  
In 2017,  among  current  e-cigarette  users,  only 17 percent  of Vermont  high school  students  
reported  flavors  as a reason  to use e-cigarettes.  Comparatively,  35 percent  cited  friends  and/or  
family  members  and 33 percent  cited  “other.”9 
In 2019,  among  high school  students  that were  current  e-cigarette  users,  only 10 percent  of 
Vermont  youth  that used e-cigarettes  cited  flavors  as a primary  reason  for using  e-cigarettes,  
while  17 percent  of Vermont  high school  students  reported  using  e-cigarettes  because  their 
family  and/or  friends  used them.10 
In 2019,  among  all Virginia  high school  students , only 3.9 percent  reported  using  e-cigarettes  
because  of flavors,  12.1 used for some  other  reason,  and 9.6 used them  because  of friends  and/or  
family  members.11 
If lawmakers want to address youth vaping, they must understand why youths are vaping.   
Adult E-Cigarette Use  
The CDC provides data on adult e -cigarette use for only 2016, 2017, and 2021.  
In 2021 (among all Maine adults), 5.8 percent were currently using e -cigarettes. This is a 41.5 
percent increase from 2017 when 4.4 percent of Maine adults were current e -cigarette users.  
In 2021 (among all Maine adults), 20 percent of 18 - to 24 -year-olds, 9.3 percent of 25 –44-year-
olds, 2.8 percent of 55 –64-year-olds, and one percent of adults aged 65 years or older were 
currently using e -cigarettes.  
Among adul ts earning $25,000 or less, 7.9 percent reported current e -cigarette use, compared to 
5.1 percent who reported earning $50,000 or more.  
In Maine, 5.7 percent of White adults were currently vaping in 2021. There is no data for other 
races.  
Young Adult Smoking Rates  
As e-cigarettes have disrupted the traditional tobacco market, policymakers have shifted their 
attention towards youth use and subsequent smoking initiation. Despite the rhetoric, the 
introduction of e -cigarettes has not led to increases in y oung adult cigarette smoking, but rather, 
correlates with significant declines.

(202)  930-1716,  www.protectingtaxpayers.org  
  
  
E-cigarettes first came to U.S. market in 2007 when 28.7 percent of Mainers aged 18 to 24 years 
old were currently smoking. In 2018, public health purported to a so -called “yo uth vaping 
epidemic” when 14.4 percent of young adults in the Pine Tree State were smoking. Between 
2007 and 2018, young adult smoking rates declined by 49.8 percent. Further, since 2018, young 
adult smoking rates have decreased another 56.3 percent, with average annual declines of 21.3 
percent.  
Though data is limited to only three years, increases in vaping correlate with decreases in 
smoking.  
In 2017 (among 18 - to 24 -year-olds), 15.1 percent and 9.7 percent were currently using 
combustible cigarettes an d e-cigarettes, respectively. Between 2017 and 2021, current cigarette 
use among young adults decreased by 58.3 percent while vapor product use increased by 106 
percent.  
Given the epic lows in young adult smoking rates, lawmakers must refrain from policies that 
restrict access to alternatives to smoking.  
Vapor Economics 101: Maine  
Electronic cigarettes and vapor products are not only a harm reduction tool for hund reds of 
thousands of smokers in the Land of Enchantment, they’re also an economic boon.  
In 2021, according to the analysis by the Vapor Technology Association, the industry created 
241 direct vaping -related jobs in Maine. These jobs generated more than $7.2 million in wages.12 
Moreover, the industry has created hundreds of secondary jobs in the Pine Tree State, bringing 
the total economic impact in 2021 to $19.4 million. In the same year, Maine received more than 
$4 million in state taxes attributab le to the vaping industry.  
Unfortunately, efforts by anti -vaping organizations and policymakers have negatively affected 
vape shops in the Pine Tree State. The number of employees has decreased by 23 percent from 
313 in 2018 to 241 in 2021.13 Further, stat e tax collections in 2021 were down 1.9 percent from 
2018’s level of $4.09 million. Overall, the economic output from the vaping industry in Maine 
increased by only 5.6 percent, from $51.4 million in 2018 to $54.3 million in 2021.  
Existing Flavor Bans Lead  To Increases in Young Adult Smoking  
Currently, five states ban the sale of flavored vapor products, with two that have also banned the 
sale of flavored tobacco products, including cigars and combustible cigarettes.  
According to data from the CDC, smoking  rates among young adults aged 18 to 24 years old 
decreased on average by 19.7 percent between 2020 and 2021. Yet, in three of the then -four 
states with active flavor bans, smoking rates increased.

In Massachusetts, 7.4 percent of 18 - to 24 -year-olds were  current smokers in 2021. This is an 8.8 
percent increase from 2020 when only 6.8 percent of young adults in the Bay State were 
currently smoking. In  New York, young adult smoking rates increased by 12.7 percent from 5.5 
percent in 2020 to 6.2 percent in 2 021. In  Rhode Island, between 2020 and 2021, smoking rates 
among young adults aged 18 to 24 years old increased by 5.7 percent.  
Of the four states with active flavored e -cigarette bans, only  New Jersey  saw a reduction (6.8 
percent) in young adult smoking r ates.  This is significantly lower than the average rate of 
reduction among all U.S. young adults.  
 
Existing Flavor Bans Failed to Significantly Reduce Both Tobacco and Vaping Use Among 
Youth and Adults  
According to data from state surveys, there were greater declines in youth vaping rates among 
states that did not have flavor bans in place  over the past two years.14  
Massachusetts banned the sales of flavored tobacco and vapor products in 2020. Similar t o 
national and other state data,  youth vaping peaked in the Bay State in 2019  when 14.7  percent  of 
middle schoolers and 51.1  percent  of high schoolers reported ever trying a vapor product. 
Between 2019 and 2021, ever -use of e -cigarettes declined by 39.5  percent  among Massachusetts 
high schoolers and by 31.3  percent  among middle schoolers. Among high school students,

current vaping rates, defined as having used the product on at least one occasion in the 30 days 
prior, declined by a whopping 45  percent . 
Prop onents of prohibiting the sale of flavored vapor products have welcomed these declines, 
turning towards the two -year ban the state has had in place as the reason for reducing vaping 
rates among American youth. Yet, in states that have not imposed such proh ibitions, vaping rates 
declined as well and, in some cases, far more significantly.  
For example, in  neighboring New Hampshire, current vaping rates among high schoolers 
decreased by 52  percent  from 33.8  percent  in 2019 to 16.2  percent  in 2021. In Hawaii, w here 
lawmakers are currently mulling over banning the sale of flavored tobacco and vapor products, 
current vaping rates among middle students decreased by 62.1  percent  and by 51.6  percent  
among high school students. Connecticut has also debated banning the  sale of flavored tobacco 
and vapor products. Between 2019 and 2021, the percentage of  Connecticut high school 
students  who were currently using e -cigarettes declined by 60.7  percent  between 2019 and 2021.  
Vaping rates have declined more significantly in s tates without flavored bans in place. For 
instance, among  Rhode Island high school students, current use of e -cigarettes decreased by only 
40.9 percent  between 2019 and 2021. The Ocean State banned the retail sale of flavored e -
cigarettes in October 2019.  
But the experience in Massachusetts is even more interesting as it has not led to a significant 
reduction in smoking rates among adults.15  
In 2021, according to data from the CDC’s  Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Systems survey,  
10.6 percent  of adults  in Massachusetts  were currently smoking, which was a 12.4  percent  
decrease from 2019 (the year prior to the flavor ban) when 12.1  percent  of adults were then 
currently smoking. In  New Hampshire, smoking rates among adults decreased by 22.6  percent  
during the same period, from 15.9  percent  of adults that were currently smoking in 2019 to 12.3  
percent  in 2021.  
Even more intriguing, while in neighboring New Hampshire smoking rates among adults in the 
state were significantly declining, revenue from  state excise cigarette taxes  was increasing.  
In 2021, the Granite State collected $228.3 million in state cigarette excise tax revenue. This was 
a 20.5 percent  increase from 2019’s $189.4 million. Conversely, in Massachusetts, cigarette tax 
revenue decreased by 28  percent  from $515.2 million in 2019 to $370.8 million in 2021.  
Illicit Market Thriving  
New York banned the sale of flavored vapor product s in 2020 and it is not hard to search online 
marketplaces finding flavored vapor products available for sale. Such products are unregulated 
and pose hazards to consumers.

For example, one online ad offers a wide variety of flavored e -liquid from peach to  cotton candy 
and menthol. The seller offers these at 26th Street and 9th Avenue in Manhattan. The seller also 
remarks that “[p]ersonal questions of [his] cost, date purchased, where purchased, why selling is 
no one’s concern.” In California, which recentl y banned the sale of flavored tobacco and vapor 
products, the “menthol man” is offering to deliver menthol cigarettes for $15 -a-pack in 
Sacramento.   
Should Maine move forward with a ban, one could expect more instances of such sales.  
Tobacco Monie s 
Each year, states receive billions of dollars borne out of the lungs of persons who smoke. This 
revenue includes excise cigarette taxes and settlement payments. Yet, each year, states spend 
miniscule amounts of tobacco -related monies on programs to help adults quit smoking and 
prevent youth use.  
In 2021, the Pine Tree State collected an estimated $112.8 million in state excise tax revenue 
from combustible cigarettes.16 This was a 6.5 percent decrease from 2020’s $120.6 million. 
Between 2000 and 2021, Maine collected more than $2.6 billion in cigarette taxes.  
Since 2000 Maine has collected annual payments from tobacco manufacturers based on the 
percentage of cigarettes and tobacco products sold in the state in that year. Maine collected $48.6 
million in settlement payments in 2021, a 5.2 percent increase from 2020’s $46.2 million.17 Since 
2000 the Pine Tree State collected over $1.1 billion in tobacco settlement payments .  
While Maine collected an estimated $161.4 million in tobacco -related monies in 2021, the state 
allocated only $13.9 million in state funding towards tobacco control programs, including 
cessation, education, and youth prevention efforts, which was a 17.8  percent increase in funding 
from 2020 levels.18 This amounts to 12.3 percent of taxes and 28.6 percent of settlement 
payments. In 2021, for every $1 the state received in tobacco monies, it spent only $0.08 on 
tobacco control efforts.  
Conclusion  
Lawmakers  must  refrain  from  prohibitionist  policies  that will only drive  adult  consumers  to an 
underground  market,  exposing  users  to possibly  harmful,  unregulated  products.  Given  the 
significant  reductions  in youth  use of e-cigarettes,  as well as the record  lows  in use of traditional  
tobacco  products,  bans on the sales  of flavored  tobacco  and vapor  products  are not necessary.  
Rather,  policymakers  should  use more  of the already -existing  monies  derived  from  cigarettes  to 
prevent  youth  use and help adults  quit.
