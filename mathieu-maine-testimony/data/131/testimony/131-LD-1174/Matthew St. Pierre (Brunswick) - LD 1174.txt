"This bill prohibits the sale and distribution of flavored tobacco products, including 
flavored cigars and electronic smoking devices." So this summary from your website 
basically means that this is a flavor ban for vapes, e-cigarettes, and cigarellos but its 
totally fine to keep selling regular plain flavored tobacco, which will be limited to 
cigarettes cuz what big tobacco company actually makes flavored cigarettes? If this is 
to make it 'unappealing' to kids its not gonna work, a good portion of middle aged 
smokers who vape didn't start out vaping they started out smoking cigarettes in their 
teens, today's youth wont be any different. Please do not pass this bill
