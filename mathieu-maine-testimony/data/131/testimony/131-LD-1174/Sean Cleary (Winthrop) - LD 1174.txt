My wife and I are former smokers, all because of vaping.  We've been smoke-free for 
five years now.  No tar clogging up our lungs, no hacking coughing in the morning, 
no repulsive stench.  We are nicotine addicts, and vaping drastically reduced the 
danger of our addiction.  That is a fact.
We happen to like mint flavored vaping liquid.  And even if this well-meaning but 
terribly misguided bill passes, we will not go back to smoking.  Bully for us.  What 
about the scores of thousands of Maine smokers who haven't made the switch YET?  
Vaping feels very different than smoking, and a pleasing flavor makes it easier.
This legislation would make it harder for smokers to trade their cigarettes for a 
less-unhealthy habit.  How smokers who would have made the switch eventually will 
die of smoking-related conditions because you made it harder to make the switch?  I 
implore you to think about THEM before passing this bill.
