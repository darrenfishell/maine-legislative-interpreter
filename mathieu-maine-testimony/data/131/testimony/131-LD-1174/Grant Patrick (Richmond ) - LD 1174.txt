How dare any of you even propose that I should be forced back into 7sing the same 
products that killed my father. Vapes have helped me recover from the damage 
caused by the people I can only assume are lining your pockets.  How anyone could 
have the audacity to force me back to a horrible product that kills hundreds of 
thousands a year, and still sleep at night is beyond me. That's shameful. There's 
women dancing in the Lewiston street lights making better contributions to society. 
The fact that you would send any portion of your constituent base to an early grave is 
all I need to know about any of you. That doesn't even bring up the TREASON, or the
TYRANNY involved with a government that thinks it can choose what I consume. 
Hasn't really ended well in the past.
