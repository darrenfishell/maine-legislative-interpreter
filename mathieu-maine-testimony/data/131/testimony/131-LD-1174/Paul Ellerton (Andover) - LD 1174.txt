Saw this yet again at my local smoke shop, it hasn't been that long since the first 
flavor ban, but once again here we are. Why do you feel the need to ban flavored 
tobacco but not regular tobacco? electronic cigarettes make up a majority of flavored 
tobacco but big tobacco companies don't sell Pall Malls in Tropical Unicorn Fusion 
now do they? Why are you targeting vapes and the local business that sell them are 
you not afraid of the financial repercussions to your locals? people are just gonna 
flock to NH to buy their vapes this has already happened in Mass when they tried to 
ban menthol everyone just crossed the border to get their stuff and because its a far 
drive they bought 3+ times more then they would have in a local store, think about 
that for a sec..
