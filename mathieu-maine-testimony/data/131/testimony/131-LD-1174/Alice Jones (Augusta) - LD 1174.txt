Children have access to vape products because they do what kids do and try to obtain 
access to kid from asking older siblings/friends, stealing from parents, etc... no minor 
can legally walk into a smoke shop without getting carded nowadays so the flavors 
and packing on these products being appealing to kids shouldn't even be a legitimate 
reason for banning these products, its not going to stop kids from getting their hands 
on these products no different than alcohol, cannabis, or any other recreational drug. 
Banning these products isn't going to solve the problem you are just creating more 
issues among your residents vs who you decide to invest your tax dollars in. We do 
not want this ban!
