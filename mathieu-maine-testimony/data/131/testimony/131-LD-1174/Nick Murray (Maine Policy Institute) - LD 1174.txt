Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1174
and
LD
1215.
While
sponsors’
intentions
are
noble,
a
ban
on
flavored
tobacco
products
will
do
very
little
to
affect
overall
demand
for
these
products
or
use
rates
in
Maine.
It
will
simply
redirect
sales
outside
the
state,
strip
freedom
of
choice
from
consenting
adults,
and
result
in
a
flourishing
black
market
for
these
products.
It
is
likely
to
have
little-to-no
effect
on
smoking
rates,
but
some
research
suggests
that
it
could
lead
to
higher
rates
of
smoking
among
adults
and
kids.
The
Massachusetts
Department
of
Revenue’s
(DOR)
Illegal
Tobacco
Task
Force
(ITTF)
has
published
several
illuminating
reports
since
the
state’s
ban
on
flavored
tobacco
products
went
into
effect
in
June
2020.
1
A
year
after
the
ban
went
into
effect,
regional
tobacco
usage
had
not
changed;
sales
just
moved
across
the
border,
primarily
to
low-tax
New
Hampshire.
2
Seemingly,
the
only
effects
were
substantially
lower
earnings
for
Massachusetts
store
owners
and
employees,
and
$114
million
less
in
tax
revenue
in
the
first
12
months
after
the
ban.
3
The
trend
of
lost
tobacco
tax
revenue
has
also
continued,
though
the
largest
drop
was
in
the
first
year
of
the
ban.
Today,
the
state
is
bringing
in
27%
less
from
all
tobacco-related
products,
nearly
30%
less
cigarette
tax
revenue,
and
47%
less
revenue
from
smokeless
tobacco
compared
to
Fiscal
Year
2019,
the
year
before
the
ban
went
into
effect.
Clearly,
the
ban
and
heightened
tax
did
not
deter
Massachusetts
tobacco
users;
they
simply
switched
to
a
different,
unflavored
product,
or
they
drove
over
the
border
to
find
their
preferred
flavored
product.
The
proof
is
in
the
data.

The
New
England
Convenience
Store
and
Energy
Marketers
Association
(NECSEMA)
tracked
the
effect
of
this
policy
on
the
regional
market
between
June
and
December
2020,
compared
to
the
same
period
in
2019.
They
found
that
total
cigarette
sales
in
New
Hampshire
jumped
46%.
Menthol
cigarette
sales
grew
by
90%,
and
sales
of
mint/wintergreen
smokeless
tobacco
more
than
doubled
in
the
Granite
State,
all
while
cigarette
sales
fell
nearly
24%
and
overall
sales
at
convenience
stores
fell
10%
in
Massachusetts.
4
This
proposal
is
useless
at
best
and
fiscally
irresponsible
at
worst.
In
fact,
the
last
two
iterations
of
the
ITTF
reports
note
that
Massachusetts
law
enforcement
has
had
to
expend
far
more
resources
going
after
tobacco
product
smugglers
and
tax
evaders.
The
2022
ITTF
annual
report
notes
that
“the
Commonwealth’s
high
tax
rates
on
OTP
[tobacco
products
excluding
cigarettes]
relative
to
other
states
provide
smugglers
an
incentive
to
import
such
products
from
low-tax
states
and
sell
them
to
in-state
buyers
willing
to
illegally
evade
payment
of
the
applicable
Massachusetts
tobacco.”
5
This
too
contributes
to
societal
degradation,
as
law
enforcement
resources
have
been
redirected
from
serious
crime
to
policing
failing
prohibitions.
Perhaps
an
obvious
bit
of
foreshadowing,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
regulators
could
have
missed
the
extent
of
the
massive
recent
spike
in
tobacco
smuggling
which
took
place
in
the
last
year.
Menthol
cigarettes
and
cigars
made
up
the
largest
category
of
illicit
tobacco
seizures.
Massachusetts
State
Police
reported
contraband
cigarette
seizures
soared
from
just
40
packs
in
2021
to
more
than
1,900
last
year.
In
addition,
seizures
of
illicit
smokeless
tobacco
were
up
800%
year-over-year
in
2022.
In
fact,
the
Massachusetts
Department
of
Revenue
(DOR)
has
greatly
increased
its
enforcement
of
state
tobacco
tax
evasion,
showing
inspections
jumping
by
more
than
42%
from
Fiscal
Year
2020
to
Fiscal
Year
2022.
This
has
resulted
in
a
considerable
jump
in
seizures,
showing
that
cross-border
smuggling
continues
as
well.
6
When
will
proponents
finally
realize
that
this
policy
has
been
a
massive
failure
where
it
has
been
tried?
The
urge
to
lump
in
electronic
nicotine
delivery
systems
(ENDS),
known
as
e-cigarettes
or
nicotine
vaporizers,
is
also
misguided.
These
products
are
clearly
reducing
harm
for
adults
who
are
addicted
to
nicotine
and
trying
to
avoid
more
destructive
combustible
cigarettes.
Why
would
lawmakers
remove
this
option
for
adults

who
are
struggling
to
reduce
their
nicotine
and
tar
consumption
when
real-world
evidence
shows
that
banning
ENDS
pushes
adults—and
kids—to
smoke
more?
7
In
an
interview
with
Forbes,
Michael
Pesko,
economist
at
Georgia
State
University
and
an
author
of
an
NIH-funded
study
published
in
January
2020,
estimated
that
“for
every
e-cigarette
pod
no
longer
purchased
as
a
result
of
an
e-cigarette
tax,
6.2
extra
packs
of
cigarettes
are
purchased
instead,”
noting
strong
product
substitution.
Pesko
and
colleagues
found
that
for
a
10%
hike
in
ENDS
prices,
sales
dropped
26%,
but
11%
more
combustible
cigarettes
were
sold.
8
Imagine
the
level
of
substitution
when
a
less
harmful
product
is
banned.
People
using
them
to
quit
more
harmful
cigarettes
will
simply
go
back
to
the
option
that
is
worse
for
their
health.
The
math
is
simple:
the
more
nicotine
users
who
switch
from
combustible
cigarettes
to
vaporizers,
the
more
lives
saved.
Lawmakers
shouldn’t
undermine
this
success
with
outright
bans
on
the
flavored
vaping
products
they
prefer
to
quit
combustible
cigarettes.
Adults
in
a
free
society,
participating
in
constitutional
government,
deserve
a
presumption
of
liberty.
Economic
policy
may
help
limit
what
economists
call
“negative
externalities,”
or
costs
to
the
public
resulting
from
individual
behavior
which
do
not
infringe
on
constitutional
rights,
but
policy
must
be
carefully
crafted
to
avoid
unintended
consequences
like
those
seen
in
Massachusetts.
When
politicians
restrict
products
like
ENDS,
they
take
society
multiple
steps
backward
in
the
mission
for
better
overall
health.
Entrepreneurial
innovation
of
smoking-cessation
products
will
contribute
much
more
to
public
health
than
the
blunt
instruments
of
the
state.
Please
deem
LD
1174
and
LD
1215
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
spare
state
coffers,
public
health,
and
Mainers’
personal
freedom
from
the
injury
which
would
surely
result
from
passage,
as
Massachusetts
has
shown
us.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
