Honorable
Michelle

Committee
members
Dear
Co-Chairs
Baldacci
and
Meyer
and
members
of
the
Joint
Health
and
Human
Services 
Committee,
On
behalf
of
National
T axpayers
Union,
the
nation’ s
oldest
taxpayer
advocacy
or ganization,
I
am
testifying
in
strong
opposition
to
LD1 174.
I
speak
to
you
not
only
in
my
role
at
NTU
but
also
as
a
former
nurse
practitioner
and
former
W isconsin
state
senator
who
chaired
the
Senate
Committee
on
Health.
This
legislation
would
place
the
government
between
buyers
and
sellers,
regulate
FDA-approved
products
out
of
existence,
and
also
create
the
unintended
consequence
of
an
illicit
market
for
these
products.
I
hope
you
will
consider
these
concerns
and
oppose
this
legislation.
LD1 174
is
a
broad
and
expansive
ban
on
tobacco
and
vaping
products
that
are
currently
FDA-approved
and,
in
essence,
creating
a
prohibition
of
these
products.
This
is
an
excessive
government
overreach
that
will
invariably
spur
an
illicit
market
in
the
state
of
Maine.
History
is
replete
with
examples
of
negative
outcomes
that
arise
from
government
prohibitions.
Alcohol
prohibition
pushed
individuals
into
the
black
market
and
exposed
them
to
toxic
levels
of
boot-legged
alcohol.
Similarly ,
LD1 174
is
likely
to
expose
individuals
to
dangerous
counterfeit
products,
posing
an
undue
public
health
risk.
If
we
have
learned
one
thing
from
history
it
is
that
government
bans
will
never
eliminate
demand
for
the
prohibited
product
but
rather
will
shift
demand
to
more
harmful
alternatives.
As
lawmakers
concerned
about
the
health
of
the
citizenry ,
surely
this
is
a
consequence
worth
preventing.
The
prohibition
of
menthol
cigarettes
in
LD1 174
also
carries
the
risk
of
unintended
consequences.
A
2012
study
in
the
journal,
Addiction
concluded
that
25
percent
of
menthol
cigarette
smokers
said,
“they
might
seek
out
menthol
cigarettes,
implying
they
might
consider
black
market
purchases.”
Not
only
does
this
expose
individuals
to
potential
negative
health
consequences
from
unregulated
products,
but
also
places
a
strain
on
law
enforcement
who
will
likely
require
additional
taxpayer
dollars
to
enforce
the
law .
There
are
lessons
to
learn
from
other
states
that
have
passed
similar
legislation.
Massachusetts
passed
a
flavored
tobacco
ban
and,
according
to
a
study
conducted
by
the
T ax
Foundation
,
the
ban
did
not
result
in
a
reduction
of
flavored
tobacco
products.
It
merely
changed
where
products

were
bought.
Despite
flavored
tobacco
products
being
technically
banned,
people
found
what
they
wanted
by
crossing
state
lines
or
using
the
illicit
market.
As
lawmakers,
you
should
carefully
consider
the
unintended
consequences
these
bans
will
have
on
public
health
as
well
as
their
potential
to
inflict
harm
on
small
businesses
and
individual
consumers
who
will
possibly
pay
more
for
safer
alternatives
to
smoking,
be
exposed
to
greater
harm
from
black-market
products
or
worse
yet,
be
driven
back
to
smoking
cigarettes.
I
hope
you
stand
with
the
residents
of
Maine
and
oppose
LD1 174.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
of
NTU’ s
comments,
please
reach
out
should
you
have
any
questions.
Sincerely ,
Leah
