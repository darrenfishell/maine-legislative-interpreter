Please don't ban flavored tobacco products, switching to e-juice was hard but overall I
am so happy that I did because even though I still need my nicotine i overall feel 1000
times better then when I was smoking cigarettes. I smoked butts for 12 years and 
switched to vaping about 3 years ago and the difference is exponential! I know I'm 
not the only one who feels this way so I speak on behalf of all of those afraid to speak
out and take the time to plead with lawmakers, DO NOT DO THIS!
