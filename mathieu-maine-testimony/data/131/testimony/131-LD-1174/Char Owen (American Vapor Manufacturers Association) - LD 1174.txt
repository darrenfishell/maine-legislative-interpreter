 
 
Dear Committee Members, 
 
As the President of the American Vapor Manufacturers Association, I strongly oppose a ban on 
vaping flavors. Vaping has been a game-changer for many former smokers who have struggled to quit 
smoking for years. The availability of a wide range of flavors has made the transition to vaping much 
more enjoyable and helped many smokers break their addiction. 
Banning vaping flavors would deal a severe blow to the entire vaping industry, including manufacturers, 
distributors, and retailers, and could result in massive job losses. Moreover, such a ban would drive 
adult vapers back to smoking and push them to the black market, where unregulated products could 
pose potentially dangerous risks. For example, a ban on menthol cigarettes was implemented in 
Massachusetts in 2020. However, according to a report by the New York Post, the ban resulted in a 6.6 
percent increase in the state's black market for menthol cigarettes. This demonstrates that banning a 
specific flavor or product does not eliminate the demand for it but rather drives it underground, creating 
an unregulated and potentially dangerous market.  
Furthermore, vaping has been proven to be less harmful than smoking cigarettes, and many former 
smokers have significantly improved their overall health since switching to vaping. The UK is so 
confident of this that they have started a Swap to Stop campaign where they give free vaping kits to 
citizens to encourage them to quit. If the government is genuinely concerned about public health, it 
should focus on providing accurate information about vaping and regulating the manufacturing process 
to ensure the safety of all products. 
In addition, the recent statements made by Brian King of the FDA during a webinar with AVM indicate 
that flavor is not required to reduce youth use since it is already in decline. King stated that youth use 
has dropped significantly and is no longer an epidemic, which clearly indicates that the industry has 
taken significant strides to address concerns about youth access to vaping products. 
It is crucial to acknowledge the efforts made by the industry to combat youth vaping and prevent access 
to minors. Many vaping companies have implemented strict age verification systems, which have been 
shown to be effective in preventing minors from accessing vaping products. Additionally, the industry 
has been working with federal and state regulators to ensure that all vaping products are subject to 
strict manufacturing and labeling standards. 
Moreover, banning vaping flavors would have a significant economic impact, forcing many small vaping 
businesses to close their doors. This would result in the state's loss of jobs and a substantial loss of tax 
revenue. Vaping is a growing industry and has become a source of income for many entrepreneurs who 
have invested their time and money in developing their businesses. A ban on vaping flavors would 
devastate these small businesses, which are already struggling due to the economy. 
Policymakers should consider the economic impact of any policy decisions, and a ban on vaping flavors 
would be detrimental to the vaping industry and the economy as a whole. Instead of pursuing a flavor 
 
ban, we should focus on implementing policies that support small businesses, promote public health, 
and ensure the safety of all vaping products. A well-regulated vaping industry can continue providing a 
safer alternative to smoking for millions of adults while contributing to the economy and creating jobs. 
Furthermore, the example of California, which implemented a flavor ban in 2021, shows that a flavor 
ban not only hurts small businesses but also significantly impacts state revenue, leading to cuts in critical 
public services and programs. Their ban is estimated to cost the state over 329 million dollars. 
Instead of banning flavors, policymakers should focus on requiring age verification systems and labeling 
requirements to ensure the safety of all vaping products. Additionally, education campaigns should be 
launched to provide accurate information about the risks and benefits of vaping, particularly for young 
people. 
In conclusion, there are more effective approaches to addressing concerns about youth vaping than 
banning flavors or products. It would create unintended consequences, such as a significant economic 
impact, harm small businesses, drive demand to the black market, and potentially result in public health 
and safety risks. We should instead focus on implementing evidence-based policies that promote public 
health, support small businesses, and ensure the safety of all vaping products. 
 
Kind Regards,
