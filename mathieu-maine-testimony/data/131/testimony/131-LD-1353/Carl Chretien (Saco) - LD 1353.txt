LD 1353 An Act to Establish a Model Residential Ventilation Design and  Installation Standard  
 
 
Senator Pinny Beebe- Center  
Representative Susan Salisbury 
RE: LD 1353  
Senator Beebe- Center , Representative Salisbury  and members of the C riminal Justice and P ublic Safety joint  standing 
committee,  
  
My name is Carl M Chretien resident of Saco, here representing myself and the Home Builders and Remodelers Association 
of Maine.  
Full disclosure I am cur rently  certified in 12 areas of code enforcement and in the 8 areas that have been established for third 
party inspectors.  
I am asking this committee to report out a unanimous ought not to pass on this bill for the below reasons.  
Currently there is lack of quality training for any of the three standards from ASHRAE that have ventilation components and the 
International Mechanical code for which I have served on the code development committee for 2021 and 2024 as well as the 
Plumbing, Mechanical, Gas and Swimming pool Code Action Committee for the 2021 codes. Also served on the 2015 and 
2018 code action development committee for the International Residential Code Plumbing and Mechanical section.  Based on 
this I can comfortably say we have the residential ventilation segment covered. At this time the communities who may looking to  
adopt this new code have their handful just getting everyone on board for the enhanced  
 
Here to speak in against of LD 1353 as it was the intent of legislation passed on April 24, 2008,  with LD 2257 to create a 
single state wide building code to better ser ve the citizens of Maine which would create uniformity in the built environment. 
This act repealed many discontinuous sections of statute and created one section under one title.  PUBLIC Law, Chapter 
699, An Act To Establish a Uniform Building and Energy Code (maine.gov) . T his comes  also from the recommendations  
of the Brookings Institute Study had done in the late 1990 ’s which talked to having streamlined consistent  codes for 
robus t and meaningful economic development.  
 
At this time  there is no free view of this standard like many of the other we currently  are using,  and the cost is $122 for 
a PDF download.  I have reached out to many of my colleagues who specialize in this filed and they were not able to 
comment on this as they are not able to view  it. This is unreasonable to ask builders , suppliers  or HVAC installers to  
buy this s tandard for maybe a few jobs a year as there are only two municipalities  who would even consider this 
standard. T hese standards are beyond the purview  of many code officials who currently are only getting lackluster 
training  in any ventilation standard. T he technical expertise is beyond most code officials at this time as the training for 
the codes since MUBEC was established has been on again off again  romance story . I can testify to this as a code 
official and third party inspector who has to go online or travel outside the state to get any meaningful training most  of

 Maine contract law has this statement from the AG’s office for consumers for repairs 17.5 and 18.3.  
 
§ 17. 5. Statewide Building and Energy  Code  
As of December 1, 2010 almost all Maine home construction must meet the standards set by the Maine Uniform      Building and Energy Code (MUBEC) (10 MRSA §§ 9721- 9725). This means developers and builders need to make 
certain their plans and specifications are compliant with the MUBEC provisions. If you are hiring a contractor to do home construction or repair work you should insist that the written contract include a statement that ensures the work 
will done in accordance with the MUBEC provisions. See the model Home Construction contract in Chapter 18. Local 
codes will remain in effect until the MUBEC is adopted.  
If you think your home contractor performed sub- standard work then you should review the construction standards of 
the MUBEC and be ready to explain to the contractor why you think the work needs to be done over. Your first source 
for MUBEC information is your local Code Enforcement Officer. Also, the Department of Public Safety can provide you with the Code’s requirements. Go to www.maine.gov/dps/bbcs .  
Enforcement is being accomplished in a phased approach:  
A. All municipalities with over 4,000 persons are required to enforce the MUBEC as of July 1, 2012.  
B. Municipalities with less than 4000 persons are not required to adopt the MUBEC.  
 
Except ions to this new statewide building code are (1) log homes, (2) manufactured housing, and (3) post and beam 
or timber frame construction.  
 
§ 18. 3. Statewide Building and Energy Code  
 
As of December 1, 2010,  almost all Maine home construction must meet the standards set by the Maine Uniform 
Building and Energy Code (MUBEC) (10 MRSA §§ 9721- 9725). This means developers and builders need to make 
certain their plans and specifications are compliant with the MUBEC provisions. If you are hiring a contractor to do 
home construction or repair work,  you should insist that the written contract include a statement that ensures the work 
will done in accordance with the MUBEC provisions. See the model Home Construction contract in Chapter 18. Local 
codes will remain in effect until the MUBEC is adopted.  
If you think your home contractor performed sub- standard work,  then you should review the construction standards of 
the MUBEC and be ready to explain to the contractor why you think the work needs to be done over. Your first source for MUBEC information is your local Code Enforcement Officer. Also, the Department of Public Safety can provide you 
with the Code’s requirements. Go to www.maine.gov/dps/bbcs . Does your municipal code enforcement officer (CEO) 
have to enforce this new law? Yes, but not right away. Enforcement is being accomplished in a phased approach:  
A. Towns with over 4,000 persons which already had a construction code, begin enforcement of the MUBEC on December 1, 2010.  
B. Towns with over 4,000 persons which did not have a code will have until July 1, 2012,  to begin enforcing the new 
code.  
C. Towns with less than 4,000 persons are not required to enforce the MUBEC.  
 The Home Builders and Remodelers Association of Maine has work ed the AG’s office in getting this language and 
other language available to consumers.

While this bill doesn’t require moving to the most recent codes being the Model year 2018 as well as incorporating the 2018 IMC,  I believe it could be combined with LD 1509 to create what is lacking at the moment. Though I believe that 
eliminating the Maine Uniform Energy Code as well as the Maine Uniform Building Code will not affect any town as to 
my knowledge all towns using codes have adopted the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code.  
 
As far  as the enforcement piece with the use of TPI’s here is the breakdown by counties.  This as the current list as of 
2019. The list has not been updated at least as far as I could which makes it difficult for anyone to find a TPI if they needed one. TPI_list_0.pdf (maine.gov)

This will cause issues due lack of qualified people in the areas where it is neede d most.  
  
Being  a code  official  and third party  inspector  most  of my training  and knowledge  of the code  comes  from attending the code 
hearings  and participating in the code development  process.  I have been evaluating the limited  training thru the state to gage 
what they are learning compared to how they enforce the code while chiming in steer the direction to which it needs to go. I 
talk regularly to staff and leadership at ICC on various topics as well as being a liaison to regional representatives due to my 
membership with the National Association of Home Builders to help bridge the gap that code officials have with engagement 
with ICC. 
 
I am also a certified code enforcement officer as well as a Third -Party  Inspector. While we have come along away in 
our enforcement of the codes specifically the energy code,  we have much work to do specifically in getting more 
advanced training to th ose in the field as well getting more involvement with contractors in the training. I also have 
served on the IRC Plumbing and Mechanical committee for the 2015 and 2018 International Residential Code 
Plumbing and Mechanical chapters, the 2015 General committee for the International Green Conservation Code 
which is an above code  and most recently the committee for 2021 for the International Mechanical Code for the 
respective code action hearings helping in selecting from amongst various code proposals that should be made into their respective code changes. I am quite familiar with the respective code changes made to these sections over the 
past cycles.  
I am also on serving on the Plumbing Mechanical Gas Code Action Committee for the current 2021 code cy cle 
responsible for advancing code proposals for the IMC, IPC, International Gas Code and International Pool and Spa 
Code by helping author code or editorial changes based on requests for code interpretations thru the ICC.  
 
 
HUD has issued a statement to lenders of FHA loans that they use ICC certified code officials on certain inspections and to 
date we only have two certified code officials thru ICC.  
 
So I hope you disapprove this bill.  
 
  
  Sincerely,
