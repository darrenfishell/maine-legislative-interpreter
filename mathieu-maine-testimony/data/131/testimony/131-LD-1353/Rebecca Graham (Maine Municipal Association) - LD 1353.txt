In Opposition to 
LD 1353 - An Act to Establish a Model Residential Ventilation Design and Installation Standard 
April 19, 2023 
__________________________________________________________________________________ 
Sen. Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury and distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I providing in opposition to LD 1353, An Act to 
Establish a Model Residential Ventilation Design and Installation Standard, on behalf of the Maine 
Municipal Association, which represents the interests of municipal government before the Legislature. 
The positions of the Association are established by our 70-member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC), 
who are elected by the councils and selectboards of municipalities in each of Maine’s 35 Senate districts. 
 Under current law, municipalities may, in consultation with their residents, adopt an energy 
stretch code greater than the current Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code (MUBEC), which is not 
the current most up to date national code due to the significant costs and management that such codes 
place on construction. Communities under 4,000 residents simply do not have the staff to monitor code 
compliance for new construction, or even additions that might trigger code compliance. 
 Municipalities do not adopt stricter standards without consulting their residents through the 
ordinance adoption process. For town council forms of government this includes a public hearing on the 
proposed ordinance change along with a council vote. For town meeting towns, this includes a public 
hearing and a full town vote. Our residents and voters take umbrage at legislative attempts to preempt 
their ability to shape their community desires, and this bill not only proposes to restrict municipalities for 
adopting greater standards if they have the capacity to regulate it, but it also ties statute to a point in time 
that may not be appropriate for the future.  
 MUBEC currently uses the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning 
Engineers (ASHRAE) standards from 2013. Codes that are 10 years old. For radon, a constant issue in a 
state with significant granite resources, that code is the 2008 standard. This bill jumps the shark and 
introduces the Canadian residential building standards as a statutory standard that is not connected with 
the current ventilation codes, or used as part of the MUBEC system, instead of limiting the adoption to 
the most recent ASHRAE standard.  
 As municipalities do not regularly adopt any codes beyond MUBEC without an exceptionally 
good reason, this bill is both proportionally unnecessary and a preemption of local voter will without 
compelling need. For all of these reasons, municipal officials ask the committee to vote “ought not to 
pass” on LD 1353.
