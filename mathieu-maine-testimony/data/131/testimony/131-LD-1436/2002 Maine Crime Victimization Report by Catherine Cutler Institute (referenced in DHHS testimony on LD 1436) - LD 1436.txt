2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Executive Summary
The purpose of the Maine Crime Victimization Survey (MCVS) is to understand the extent of criminal 
victimization, crime reporting, and assistance seeking, and to identify differences in rates between 
demographic groups. A survey patterned after the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) was sent out 
in January 2022 to randomly selected adult Mainers. A total of 1,363 completed responses were received. 
The following is a summary of key findings from the 2022 MCVS: 
Crime Victimization
Just over one-third (34%) of all respondents (n=1,363) reported having been the victim of at least one crime 
in the past 12 months.
Respondents reported the highest victimization rates for stalking, identity theft, and property crime. 
•	 17% of respondents reported being the victim of a stalking crime in the previous 12 months. 
•	 16% of respondents reported being the victim of an identity crime at least once in the previous 12 
months. 
•	 9% of those surveyed reported being the victim of a property crime at least once in the previous 12 
months. 
Number of Crime Types
The majority (65%) of those who reported experiencing any crime reported just one type of crime (e.g., 
property, identity, etc.), but an additional 19% experienced two types of crime, and 16% experienced three 
or more types of crime over the past 12 months. 
Domestic Violence
Nearly one in five (18%) of those who reported having experienced any type of crime in the previous 12 
months reported that at least one crime was committed by a current or former domestic partner or family 
member. 
Hate Crime
Just over one-fifth (22%) of those who reported having experienced any type of crime in the previous 12 
months reported that they believed or suspected that the crime was perpetrated against them due to their 
race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity. 
ExEC utivE SummAR y • 2
2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Violent Crime
Approximately one out of 20 respondents (5.3%) indicated they had been the victim of a violent crime 
(robbery, assault, sexual assault, or rape/attempted rape) in the previous 12 months. 
Lifetime Rape
Twenty-three percent (23%) of all respondents reported having experienced rape/attempted rape at least 
once in their lifetime. 
Lifetime Human Trafficking 
About three percent (3%) of all survey respondents reported having experienced human trafficking (being 
forced, tricked, or manipulated into engaging in any type of labor, including commercial sex) at some point 
in their lifetime. 
Reporting to Law Enforcement  
More than two-thirds (68%) of all victims who experienced one or more crimes stated that they did not 
report the crime(s) to law enforcement.
The crimes that were reported to law enforcement most frequently were property crimes, threatening 
crimes, and violent crimes. 
•	 57% of all property crime  victims indicated that they reported at least one crime to law 
enforcement. 
•	 46% of all  threatening crime victims indicated that they reported at least one crime to law 
enforcement. 
•	 39% of all violent crime  victims indicated that they reported at least one crime to law 
enforcement. 
Seeking Victim Services
Of those who answered that they had been a victim of any type of crime (n=468), only 13% sought services 
from a victim services organization. 
The crimes that respondents sought victim services for most frequently were violent crimes, threatening 
crimes, and property crimes. 
•	 35% of all victims of violent crimes  indicated that they sought services from a victim services 
organization as a result of this type of crime. 
•	 20% of all victims of threatening crimes  indicated that they sought services from a victim services 
organization as a result of this type of crime. 
•	 12% of all victims of  property crimes  indicated that they sought services from a victim services 
organization as a result of this type of crime.

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Characteristics of Victims
Age
Young people (aged 18 to 34) were more likely to be victimized for every type of crime except identity 
crime, including property crime, threatening, violent crime, stalking, domestic violence, and hate crimes 
over the previous 12 months. They were also more likely to have experienced rape/attempted rape and 
human trafficking at some point in their lifetime.
Race and Ethnicity
Persons of color (American Indian, Asian, biracial, Black, African American, multiracial, Native Hawaiian, 
Pacific Islander and/or Hispanic persons) were more likely to be victimized for every type of crime except 
identity crime, including property crime, threatening, violent crime, stalking, domestic violence, and hate 
crimes over the past 12 months. They were also more likely to have experienced rape/attempted rape and 
human trafficking at some point in their lifetime.   
Gender
Females were more likely to experience crime in general; more likely to experience lifetime rape/attempted 
rape and trafficking; and more likely to have experienced stalking, threats of violence, violent crimes 
(robbery, assault, sexual assault, or rape/attempted rape), domestic violence, and hate crimes than their 
male counterparts.
Household Income
Those with lower household incomes were more likely than those with higher incomes to experience 
stalking, domestic violence, hate crimes, threatening, and violent crimes. They were likewise more likely 
to experience rape/attempted rape within their lifetime as well as being trafficked.  Those with higher 
incomes were more likely to experience identity crime. 
Location
Respondents from urban/suburban areas were more likely to experience domestic violence and violent 
crime compared with those from rural areas. Those from Cumberland County were more likely than those 
from other counties to experience property crime and less likely to experience violent and hate crimes. 
Those in Kennebec County were more likely than those from other countries to experience domestic 
violence. Those from Penobscot County were more likely to experience domestic violence, violent crime, 
threatening, and hate crime. Respondents from York County were less likely than those from other counties 
to experience domestic violence.

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Relationship Status 
Across nearly all types of crime, respondents without partners were more likely to be a victim than those 
with partners. Relationship status, however, is correlated with both household income and age. Older 
respondents tend to have higher household incomes and are more likely to be partnered. After controlling 
for age and income, those who are unpartnered had higher rates than partnered respondents for lifetime 
rape/attempted rape, stalking, domestic violence, threats of violence, violent crime, and lifetime trafficking.
Comparison to 2015 MCVS
The overall crime rate has decreased significantly compared to the 2015 study. While this may reflect a 
decrease in victimization, the wording of some of the current year’s survey questions differed substantively 
from the previous survey’s, which certainly contributed to this decrease. This being said, the property 
crime rate decreased from 15% in 2015 to 9% in 2021, which was a statistically significant decrease, and the 
property crime question remained the same in the current survey.

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Introduction
In 2006, the Maine Statistical Analysis Center (SAC) launched its first crime victimization survey, patterned 
after the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), a national survey on criminal victimization and crime 
trends. The Maine SAC, along with several other states, took this step because the findings from the NCVS 
could not be reported on a state-by-state basis. The initial MCVS was developed by the Maine SAC as a 
tool to better understand the frequency and characteristics of criminal victimization in Maine. This current 
report summarizes the fourth Maine Crime Victimization Survey (MCVS).
In 2010, the Maine SAC repeated the survey to compare and contrast the findings with those of the first 
survey. These survey findings were released in report form in early 2011.1 Both the 2006 and 2011 survey 
reports have been used widely by governmental agencies and statewide organizations to advocate for new 
laws to combat domestic violence, reduce victimization, and provide services for victims of crime. In 2014, 
the Maine SAC partnered with the Catherine Cutler Institutes’ Survey Research Center to conduct the MCVS 
for the third time.2
In January of 2022, the fourth iteration of the MCVS was launched by Maine SAC, once again partnering 
with the Survey Research Center. This year the MCVS was developed with support and sponsorship from 
the Office of Child and Family Services (OCFS) at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 
and the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MECASA). It is part of a larger effort to conduct a statewide 
victim service needs assessment. The information gathered in the MCVS will serve to inform the larger 
project, which will in turn inform the process of strategic planning for provisions of the Victims of Crime Act 
(VOCA) and other grant-funded programs and services that are responsive to the needs of victims of crime 
and victim service providers.
The current year’s survey gathered data about respondents’ experiences with various crimes over the 
previous 12 months, the reporting of those crimes to law enforcement, and the seeking of victim services 
as a result of those crimes. The survey was modified from the previous three years surveys though it is still 
patterned after the NCVS. These modifications mean that in some areas, comparisons between rates from 
the current MCVS and rates from the previous survey are not appropriate. This report presents comparison 
rates whenever appropriate.

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Methodology
Sample Selection
To obtain a random sample of Maine residents for this survey, the Survey Research Center (SRC) obtained 
an address-based sample frame. This frame included addresses for 12,000 Mainers aged 18 and older, 
along with landline and cell phone numbers when available so that follow-up calls could be made. The 
result was a list containing 4,002 records in which a landline number was present, 5,860 records in which 
a cell phone number was present, 1,710 records in which both phone numbers were present, and 3,848 
records in which no phone number was present.
Surveys were mailed out at the beginning of January 2022. The mailing included a cover letter, a two-page 
two-sided survey in English, and a postage-paid return envelope. The cover letter featured a bold insert 
containing a list of languages (Arabic, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Somali, and English), each translated 
into its respective language, along with a weblink in the form of a tiny URL so respondents could complete 
the survey online in any of the listed languages. Phone follow-up began a week and a half after surveys 
were mailed, and a total of 3,076 persons were randomly selected and called. Interviewers encouraged 
respondents to complete the survey over the phone, but if respondents were not able or willing, 
interviewers asked them to complete the paper or online version instead. Because preliminary analysis on 
completed surveys showed that respondents were disproportionately older, the SRC opted to utilize an 
additional online panel3 to obtain more responses from those aged 18 to 34.
The survey was shut down approximately 8 weeks after launch with a total of 1,363 responses. The majority 
of responses, 87% (n=1,181) were mail responses, 5% (n=72) were phone, 4% (n=58) were panel, and 4% 
(n=52) were online. Only two online surveys were completed in a language other than English (one in 
Spanish and one in Arabic). Of the 12,000 surveys mailed, approximately 2,304 (19%) were undeliverable. 
Interviewers called some of these respondents but not all, resulting in a reduction of 1,835 in the sample 
frame and an overall response rate of 13%.4
Analysis
The goal of this report is to obtain rates of victimization, crime reporting, and assistance seeking and to 
identify differences in rates between demographic groups. Toward that end, ordinal variables such as age 
and household income were often regrouped to obtain subgroups with large enough numbers to carry out 
statistical tests. This grouping was done by exploring the output visually to identify obvious “breakpoints,” 
which occurred in different places for different measures.
3 Online survey panels are made up of people who have agreed to be contacted on a regular basis to share their experiences and 
opinions. Participants are recruited from a wide variety of sources, and researchers can specify the demographics for a particular 
panel (e.g., Maine residents aged 18 to 34). These factors help ensure that the panel will be representative of the population of 
interest.
4 Response rates do not include panel participants in either the numerator or denominator.

Point Estimates, Confidence Intervals, and Confidence Levels
The purpose of most surveys is to gain information about a population by questioning a subset (or sample) 
of that population. The rates obtained from this sample are called point estimates, and these rates very 
accurately reflect the sample’s experiences with victimization. They less precisely describe the overall 
population’s experiences related to victimization. The larger the sample, the greater the likelihood that the 
sample will be representative of the population and the greater the accuracy of the estimates obtained.
In statistics, the level of precision is typically communicated in terms of confidence levels and confidence 
intervals. Confidence levels state a level of certainty about the interval. Typically, surveys employ a 95% 
confidence level, which means that there is a one in twenty chance (5%) that the confidence interval 
does not, after all, contain the true population rate. This survey has a 95% confidence level, and (because 
confidence intervals depend upon the number of responses and the distribution of answers) it has 
varying confidence intervals. These intervals are represented visually along with point estimates in graphs 
throughout the report. For the questions answered by the entire sample (n=1,363), the confidence interval 
is ±3%. 
Another issue associated with confidence intervals that bears mentioning here is that when samples are 
small, confidence intervals become large, and they become particularly large when the rates themselves 
are small. There are instances throughout this report where rates appear to be quite different, but due to 
the small number of responses, it cannot be conclusively stated that they are.
Weights
In theory, a study utilizing a random sampling design should result in a representative sample, but in 
reality, people respond to recruiting efforts in a way that is not random and which results in a sample that is 
not perfectly representative of the population. Respondents’ non-random self-selection becomes apparent 
when the sample data have demographic distributions that are different from that of the study population.
This is a common occurrence with surveys, and the current survey is no exception. To counteract 
respondents’ non-random self-selection, analysts used a weighting procedure. Survey data were weighted 
in terms of age, gender, household income, race/ethnicity, and county to match Maine’s population 
distributions as described in Census tables.5 The rates reported in this survey are weighted rates unless 
otherwise stated.
5 Age, gender, household income, and county data were obtained from the American Community Survey (5-year estimates), while 
race/ethnicity were obtained from the 2020 Decennial Census.

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. Some are the result of the tension that exists in any survey 
between the desire to collect as much data as possible and the need to operate within budget. While 
the final version of the survey asked respondents whether they had experienced each crime one time or 
multiple times, it did not ask for specific numbers. As a result, it is not possible to estimate the number of 
crimes experienced by Mainers, just the number of types of crime (e.g., property, identity, etc.).
Similarly, it is not possible to say which crimes were domestic violence crimes. Respondents who reported 
at least one crime were asked whether any crimes were committed by an intimate partner or family 
member, but they were not asked which crimes were committed by them when there were multiple crime 
types, as was often the case. This same limitation applies to hate crime—it is not possible to say which 
types of crimes were committed due to a respondent’s race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or gender 
identity when there were multiple crime types, as was also often the case.
Another limitation is the inability to look at respondents aged 18 to 24 separately. This demographic 
was underrepresented in the sample frame and had a poor response rate compared with older adults. 
The panel also did not result in enough respondents within this range to analyze them separately. As a 
result, the youngest age category includes those aged 18 to 34. Also, due to the challenge of obtaining a 
representative sample frame of those younger than 18 and the ethical constraints of surveying them about 
victimization, young people were not included in this study. 
RUCA Classification
Urban and non-urban areas in this report were calculated using Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes 
(RUCAs). RUCAs are determined by Census designation, including consideration of population density and 
work commuting patterns, and are approximated to individual zip codes. Appendix A lists the Maine zip 
codes by RUCA designation.6

Survey Findings
Survey respondents were asked whether they had been the victim of five different types of crimes over the 
past 12-month period. These types included the following: 
•	 Property crime 
•	 Violent crime (including robbery, assault, sexual assault, and rape/attempted rape) 
•	 Threatening with physical violence 
•	 Identity crime
•	 Stalking (including multiple types of stalking behavior)
Respondents who answered in the affirmative were asked two follow-up questions to determine whether 
they had reported the crimes to law enforcement and whether they sought services from a victim service 
organization. Those who reported experiencing crime were asked two more questions to determine 
whether those crimes were hate crimes and/or domestic violence crimes. Finally, respondents were asked 
two questions related to their lifetime experience with rape or human trafficking. 
Any Crime
Victimization
Just over one-third (34%) of respondents reported having been 
the victim of at least one crime in the past 12 months. This rate is a 
20-percentage point decrease from the rate found in the previous 
Maine Crime Victimization Survey (MCVS) published in 2015, which 
was 54%. While this may reflect a decrease in victimization, the 
wording of some of the current year’s survey questions differed 
substantively from the previous survey’s, which certainly contributed 
to this decrease. These wording changes will be discussed 
throughout the report where applicable.
The proportion of victims who reported any type of victimization 
varied by respondent demographic as follows:7 
•	 The demographic group most likely to experience crime was those aged 18 to 34, at 52%, 
compared with 29% of those aged 35 and over. 
•	 Persons of color were more likely than non-Hispanic White people to be the victim of crime, at 
51% and 33%, respectively. 
•	 At 38%, females were more likely to be the victim of crime than males, at 30%.

Reporting to Law Enforcement
Those who experienced any type of crime were asked  
 whether they reported any of the crimes to law enforcement. 
The proportion of victims of any crime who reported crime to law 
enforcement varied by respondent demographics as follows:8 
•	 Victims of color were the most likely to report crime to 
law enforcement at a rate of 59%, compared with a rate of 
29% for non-Hispanic White victims. 
•	 Younger victims—those between the ages of 18 and 34—
were more likely to report crime to law enforcement than any other age cohort. Almost half 
(48%) of the younger group reported crime to law enforcement, while those age 35 and older 
had a reporting rate of 25%. 
•	 Single, divorced, widowed, and separated victims (hereafter referred to as “unpartnered”) 
were more likely to report crime than married or cohabitating victims (hereafter referred to as 
“partnered”) at 39%, compared with 28%.
•	 Female victims were more likely to report crime to law enforcement, at a rate of 37%, 
compared with their male counterparts, at only 25%.

crime (n=468), only 13% sought services.
The proportion of victims of any crime who sought victim services 
varied by respondent demographics as follows:9
•	 Victims from the youngest age group (aged 18 to 34), 
were the most likely to seek victim services from an 
organization; 23% of them reported that they had 
contacted an organization at least once, compared 
with 7% of victims aged 35 and above. 
•	 Victims in lower household income brackets (less 
than $50,000) were twice as inclined, at a rate of 18%, 
to seek services than those in higher brackets, at 9%. 
•	 Victims who were unpartnered had a higher rate (17%) of seeking victim services than victims 
who were partnered (10%). 
•	 Female victims, at 16%, were more likely than male victims, at 6%, to seek services.
•	 Not surprisingly, victims living in an urban/suburban area had a higher likelihood of reaching 
out to organizations than victims in small town/rural areas, with rates of 16% and 6% 
respectively. It is highly likely that there are a greater number of services available in urban/
suburban areas.

Property Crime
Victimization
Survey respondents were asked, “In the last 
12 months, were you the victim of a property 
crime such as someone attempting to steal 
or stealing your car, breaking into, or trying 
to break into your home, or vandalizing your 
property?”  Seven percent (7%) of survey 
respondents stated they had been the victim 
of one property crime in the previous 12 
months, and 2% stated they had been the 
victim of more than one property crime 
during this period, resulting in a total of 9%.
Since the question used in the current survey 
was very similar to that of the previous 
survey, the 2022 rate can be compared to 
the 2015 rate. At 9%, the 2022 property crime 
rate was statistically significantly lower than 
2015’s rate, at 15%.10

•	 The rates of each individual county were compared with the rates of the remaining counties 
to identify geographic differences. The only significant difference was found in Cumberland 
County; the rate in Cumberland was 12% compared with the combined rate of the remaining 
counties, which was 8%.

Identity Crime
Victimization
Identity crime was the highest reported crime in the 2015 crime victimization study, and it continues 
to be an issue in 2022. The current survey asked respondents, “In the last 12 months, did you discover 
that someone had misused your credit cards, personal information, social security number, etc.?” 
Approximately 16% of all respondents answered in the affirmative. This question is slightly different from 
the question asked in the previous study, which included additional options to choose from, such as 
the attempted use of credit cards and bank accounts as well as notification from a bank or store that an 
account had been compromised. This narrowing of definition at least partially explains the lower rate 
obtained this year compared with the rate found in the 2015 study (36%).
The proportion of respondents who experienced being the victim of an identity crime varied by respondent 
demographic as follows:15
•	 At 20%, those with a household income level at or above $75,000 experienced identity crime at 
a higher rate than those with incomes of less than $75,000, at 14%.
•	 Partnered respondents experienced identity crimes at a rate of 19%, compared with 
unpartnered respondents, at a rate of 13%.16

Reporting to Law Enforcement
Those who reported experiencing one or more identity crimes were asked whether they reported any of the 
crimes to law enforcement. Approximately one out of five (21%) said that they reported at least one crime 
to law enforcement. The low rate of reporting may be because there are other avenues for reporting this 
type of crime, such as reporting to the bank or credit card company. 
The proportion of identity crime victims who reported crime to law enforcement varied by respondent 
demographics as follows:17
•	 Victims of color were the most likely to report the identity crime, at a rate of 58%, compared 
with non-Hispanic White victims, at a rate of 16%.
•	 Younger victims, aged 18 to 34, had a higher tendency to report identity crime, at a rate of 47%,

Threat of Violence
Victimization
In the MCVS, respondents were asked if someone had 
threatened to hit, attack, or assault them in the past 
12 months. Four percent (4%) of survey respondents 
reported having been the victim of one threatening 
incident in the previous 12 months, and 3% reported 
having been the victim of more than one threatening 
incident during that time, resulting in a total of 7%. This 
rate is not statistically significantly different from the 2015 
rate, which was also 7%.
The proportion of respondents who reported being 
threatened with violence varied by respondent 
demographic as follows:19
•	 Nineteen percent (19%) of the youngest cohort, aged 18 to 34, indicated that they had been the 
victim of a threat of violence at least once in the past year. Those aged 35 and above had a rate of 
just 4%. 
•	 Persons of color experienced a higher rate of threats than non-Hispanic White respondents, at

Violent Crime
Victimization
Respondents were asked questions about four violent crimes 
(including robbery, assault, sexual assault, and rape/attempted 
rape), and a small percentage of respondents reported 
experiencing one or more of these crimes in the last 12 months. 
Approximately 3% of respondents indicated they had been 
assaulted, 3% indicated they had been sexually assaulted, 2% 
indicated they had been robbed, and 1% indicated they had 
been raped or that some had attempted to.
While small numbers ar
e certainly good in a general sense, they make it difficult to accurately construct 
estimates for the population. Thus, these four crimes have been combined into a single violent crime 
category for the remainder of the analysis in this section. The proportion of respondents who experienced any violent crime was 5%, a rate which is not statistically significantly different from the previous survey’s findings. Among those who reported experiencing violent crime in the last year, about half (50%) reported experiencing more than one type of violent crime (e.g., robbery and assault). 
The proportion of respondents who reported experiencing one or more violent crimes varied by 
respondent demographic as follows:
21
• Persons of color had the highest rate of violent crime, at 17%, compared with non-HispanicWhite respondents, at 4%.
• Respondents aged 18 to 34 were more likely to experience at least one violent crime, at a rateof 16%, compared with those aged 35 and over, who reported at a rate of 1%.
• Respondents living in Penobscot County were more likely to experience violent crime, at 13%,and those in Cumberland County were less likely to experience violent crime, at 1%.
• At 9%, unpartnered respondents were more likely to experience violent crime than theirpartnered counterparts, at 3%.
• Females were more likely to experience violent crime, at a rate of 8%, compared with theirmale counterparts, at a rate of 3%.
• Those with a household income of less than $50,000 reported violent crimes at a rate of 8%,compared with those with a household income of $50,000 and over, at 4%.

Stalking
Victimization
Stalking was the most frequently reported crime in this year’s MCVS. Roughly one in every six (17%) 
respondents indicated that they had been the victim of a stalking crime in the past 12 months. The survey 
asked respondents if they felt threatened by another person (other than bill collectors, telephone solicitors, 
or other sales people) as a result of any of the following behaviors, followed by a list of eight specific 
behaviors and an additional write-in (“other”) option. These behaviors included:
•	 Following or spying
•	 Unsolicited emails/texts/letters
•	 Unsolicited phone calls
•	 Waiting/standing outside
•	 Showing up places
•	 Leaving unwanted gifts/items
•	 Spreading rumors
•	 Other unwanted communication
It bears mentioning that this point estimate may be an overrepresentation of stalking. The write-in 
responses in the current survey made it clear that some respondents were interpreting this question 
broadly and including behaviors that would fit better under identity crimes or under no crime at all. 
Examples include persistent “phishing” calls as well as phone calls and emails from political parties, which 
were perceived as harassment but should not have been counted as stalking. Responses that were clearly 
reported in error were removed, but the confusion may have been more widespread than could be detected 
through respondents’ write-in responses. Care will be taken in any future iterations of this survey to define 
stalking more clearly. Despite the confusion surrounding the stalking responses, the overall stalking rate 
found in this study was not statistically significantly different from the rate of 14% found in the 2015 study.
The proportion of respondents who reported being stalked varied by respondent demographic as follows:23
•	 Persons of color were more likely than non-Hispanic White persons to have experienced 
stalking, at a rate of 31% compared with 15%. 
•	 Those aged 18 to 34 had a higher tendency to be the victim of stalking, at 29%, compared with 
those aged 35 and above, who had a rate of 13%. 
•	 Females were more likely to experience stalking than males, with rates of 23% and 10%, 
respectively.
•	 Those with a household income of less than $50,000 were more likely that those with an 
income of $50,000 or more to be a victim of stalking, at rates of 22% and 13%, respectively. 
•	 Unpartnered respondents experienced stalking at a higher rate, 22%, than their partnered 
counterparts, who had a rate of 13%.

Stalking is often a precursor to other types of victimization, and while this survey did not ask respondents 
which crimes they experienced first, those who experienced stalking were more likely to experience other 
crimes as well. Two percent (2%) of those who were not stalked experienced a violent crime, while 25% 
of those who were stalked experienced a violent crime. Likewise, 3% of those who were not stalked were 
threatened, while 27% of those who were stalked were threatened. These differences were statistically 
significant as they were in the 2015 study.

Stalking Behaviors
Among the specific types of stalking behaviors, the survey found that unsolicited emails, texts, and/or 
letters was the most common type of stalking behavior at 8%, followed by unsolicited phone calls (7%) and 
spreading rumors (6%). The rates of different stalking behavior were not statistically significantly different 
from the rates found in 2015 with the exception of one behavior—unsolicited phone calls—which increased 
from 5% in 2015 to 7% in 2022.25 This difference may have been due to respondents’ misunderstanding of 
the question as mentioned previously in this section; because the majority of respondents in the current 
study completed the survey by mail they did not have the benefit of an interviewer’s explanation as they 
did in the previous study.

The type of stalking behavior experienced differed by victim gender. In all but one of the stalking behaviors 
(unsolicited phone calls) the difference between females and males was statistically significant.26 In several

Reporting to Law Enforcement
Those who reported experiencing one or more incidents of stalking were asked whether they reported any 
of the incidents to law enforcement. About a fifth (20%) of these respondents said they reported at least 
one crime to law enforcement. This rate was not statistically significantly different from the 2015 rate of 
21%. This rate did not vary by respondent demographic attribute. 
Seeking Victim Services
Those who reported experiencing one or more stalking crimes were also asked whether they sought 
services from a victim services organization. Of those who answered that they had been the victim of at 
least one stalking crime, a little more than one in ten (11%) reported that they had sought services. 
The proportion of stalking crime victims who sought services varied by respondent demographics as 
follows:27 
•	 Victims of stalking with household incomes of less than $25,000 were more likely to seek 
services, at a rate of 21%, compared with victims with household incomes of $25,000 and 
more, at only 8%. 
•	 Unpartnered victims of stalking contacted service organizations at a higher rate (16%) than 
partnered victims of stalking (5%). 
•	 At 14%, female stalking victims were also more likely to contact a victim services organization 
than male victims, at a rate of 3%.

Domestic Violence
Frequency
Respondents were not asked explicitly about 
domestic violence. While asking may appear to 
be the most direct way to gather this information, 
victims of domestic violence do not always 
recognize domestic violence as such. Thus, instead 
of asking directly, the survey asked respondents 
whether any of the crimes they reported previously 
in the survey (property crime, identity crime, 
threatening, violent crime, or stalking) were 
committed by a current or former intimate/
romantic/dating partner and/or a family member. 
This is a broader definition of domestic violence 
than was used in the 2015 study in two ways. First, it 
encompasses more crimes. The 2015 study did not 
ask about the relationship between the victim and 
perpetrator for property or identity crimes; thus, 
those victimizations were not counted. Also, the 
2015 study included two relationship options that 
counted as domestic violence—a family member, 
including an unmarried partner living in your 
home, and a person or people well known to you, 
excluding family. This did not account for former 
partners or people who formerly lived with the 
respondent.
Approximately 6% of all respondents reported 
having experienced domestic violence in the last 
12 months, and 18% of those who reported having 
experienced any type of crime over that time 
period reported that the crime was committed by a 
domestic partner or family member. Figure 32: Frequency of Domestic ViolenceNon-victim

Types of Crimes
Victims of domestic violence experienced more crime types than other victims. The majority (61%) of domestic 
violence victims experienced three or more crime types, while the majority (76%) of non-domestic violence 
victims experienced one type. On average, victims of domestic violence experienced 3.2 types of crimes while 
non-domestic violence victims experienced 1.2 types.28 
Because respondents could report multiple types of crime and because the survey did not ask which crimes 
were committed by domestic partners or family members, it is not possible to say definitively which offense 
types were committed in a domestic violence setting. Thus, the results in this section should be interpreted 
with caution. 
Stalking, threatening, and violent crimes (including robbery, assault, sexual assault, and rape/attempted rape) 
were the most frequently reported crimes for victims of domestic violence at 79%, 61%, and 53%, respectively. 
This is in contrast to non-domestic violence victims, whose top three reported crimes were identity crimes, 
stalking, and property crimes, at 49%, 41%, and 23%, respectively.

older, at 17% and 2% respectively. 
•	 Persons of color experienced domestic violence with three times the frequency (15%) of non-
Hispanic White respondents (5%).
•	 Respondents from Kennebec and Penobscot counties experienced domestic violence at higher 
rates (15% and 10%) than those from other counties, and respondents from York County 
experienced domestic violence at a lower rate (<1%) than others.
•	 Those with a household income below $25,000 experienced domestic violence at a higher rate

Hate Crimes
Frequency  
This year’s MCVS asked respondents whether they believe they were the victim of any of the crimes they 
reported having experienced due to their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity. They were 
provided with answer choices of  yes, no , and unsure .
Approximately 4% of all respondents said they were the victim of a hate crime and an additional 3% were 
unsure, resulting in a total of 7% who either believed or suspected they were targeted due to their race, 
gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity in the last 12 months. This group of possible hate crime 
victims made up 22% of all victims.
Types of Crimes 
In fact, possible hate crime victims do appear to be victimized more widely than other victims, which may 
support their assertion that they were targeted by perpetrators rather than randomly selected. The majority 
(62%) of possible hate crime victims experienced two or more crime types (an average of 2.1), while the 
majority (64%) of other victims experienced one type (an average of 1.7).30
Because respondents could report multiple types of crime and because the survey did not ask which 
crime types were hate crimes and which were not, it is not possible to report it definitively here. What can 
be reported is which types of crime these victims experienced and how that differs from the experience of 
other victims.
The rates for stalking, threatening, and property crime were statistically significantly higher for possible 
hate crime victims, while rates for violent crime and identity crimes were not statistically significantly 
different.31

Lifetime Rape
Frequency
The current survey included two “lifetime” 
questions, including a question about 
rape and attempted rape. This question 
asked, “In your lifetime, has anyone forced 
you, or attempted to force you to have sex 
with them?”  Approximately 12% reported 
experiencing this once, and an additional 
11% reported having experienced it more 
than once, resulting in a total of 23% of all 
respondents reporting rape or attempted 
rape. This rate is not statistically different 
from the 2015 rate (also 23%).
Demographics
The proportion of respondents who reported lifetime rape or attempted rape varied by respondent 
demographic as follows:33
•	 The lifetime rate of rape/attempted rape is four and a half times higher for females (37%) than it is 
for males (8%). 
•	 Persons of color were more likely to experience rape/attempted rape in their lifetime than non-
Hispanic White persons, at 36% and 22%, respectively.
•	 The lifetime rate of rape was negatively correlated with age. The lifetime rate of rape/attempted 
rape for the youngest group of respondents, aged 18 to 34, was 32%. For those aged 35-44, the 
rate was 27%, for those aged 45-54 the rate was 24%, for those aged 55-64 the rate was 20%, and 
for those aged 65 and over, the rate was 15%. This is counterintuitive given the larger time frame 
oldest respondents have in which to experience rape. These findings may reflect a difference in 
how respondents from different ages categories define rape or attempted rape.
•	 Respondents currently in lower household income brackets (less than $75,000) were more likely 
than their counterparts with incomes of $75,000 or more per year to experience rape/attempted 
rape in their lifetimes, at 28% compared with 17%. 
•	 Unpartnered respondents were more likely to experience a rape/attempted rape in their lifetime, 
at 30%, compared with those who are partnered, at 19%.

Human Trafficking
Frequency
The current survey included a new question related to human trafficking. It asked, “In your lifetime, have you been 
forced, tricked, or manipulated into engaging in any type of labor, including commercial sex (trading sex for money, 
goods, or service)?” A total of 3.2% (n=41) of all survey respondents responded in the affirmative to this question by 
choosing one of these options: Yes, commercial sex (0.8%); yes, other labor (2.1%); or yes, both commercial sex and 
other labor (0.3%).
Human trafficking victims were more likely to have been the victim of a crime in the past 12 months, at a rate of 
78%, compared with 34% for those who had not been forced into labor in their lifetimes.34
Demographics
The proportion of respondents who indicated that they had been trafficked varied by respondent demographic as follows:
35
• Persons of color had a higher rate of lifetime trafficking, at 12%, compared with non-Hispanic Whitepersons, at 2%.
• Respondents with household incomes of less than $25,000 had a lifetime rate of trafficking of 6%,compared with those with higher incomes, with a rate of 3%.
• Younger respondents, aged 18 to 44, had a higher rate of lifetime trafficking, at 5%, compared withtheir counterparts aged 45 and older, at 2%. This is counterintuitive given the larger time frame
older respondents have in which to experience trafficking. These findings may reflect an increased
understanding of trafficking on the part of younger respondents or it may reflect an increase in
trafficking in recent years.
• Unpartnered respondents were more likely to have experienced trafficking than their partneredcounterparts, at rates of 5% and 2%, respectively.
• Female respondents were more likely to indicate they had been trafficked, at a rate of 5%, compared
with their male counterparts, at 2%.

Demographic Characteristics of  Victims 
While the previous section of this report summarizes findings by type of crime, this section summarizes 
by victim demographic. Several demographic attributes were frequently associated with victimization regardless of crime type. The most frequently observed attributes associated with crime were age and race/ethnicity—younger adults and persons of color were more likely to be victimized for every type of crime except identity crime. Gender was also frequently associated with victimization. Household income was associated with some types of victimization, as was location (RUCA), and relationship status. 
Several demographic attributes were more frequently associated with reporting crimes to law enforcement 
and seeking victim services. Younger victims, people of color, those without partners, and females were 
more likely to report crimes and seek services than their counterparts. Those with lower household 
incomes were more likely to seek victim services than those in higher income brackets, and those in urban 
or suburban areas were more likely to seek victim services than those in rural locations. 
Age
Crime Disparity
Younger adults were more likely to be the victim of every type of crime except identity crime over the last 12 
months: 36 
• Overall, respondents be
tween the ages of 18 and 34 were more likely to experience at least
one type of victimization (52%) compared with respondents aged 35 and older (29%).
• Those aged 18 to 34 had a higher rate of lifetime rape/attempted rape, at 32%, compared
with those aged 35 and over, at 20%.
• Respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 were more likely to have been the victim ofstalking, at 29%, while their older counterparts had a lower rate, at 13%.
• Those aged 18 to 34 had a higher rate of being threatened with violence, at 19%, comparedwith those aged 35 and over, at 4%.
• Respondents aged 18 to 34 were more likely (18%) to be the victim of property crime
compared with respondents aged 35 and older (6%).

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Reporting to Law Enforcement
Younger victims of crime were more likely to report crimes to law enforcement. This was true of crime in 
general and of identity crime in particular:37
• Just over half (52%) of all victims aged 18 to 34 reported the crime to law enforcement, whilevictims aged 35 and older had a reporting rate of 29%.
• Younger victims of identity crime, aged 18 to 34, had a higher tendency to report that crime,at a rate of 47%, compared with victims aged 35 and above, who reported at a rate of 12%.

Seeking Victim Services
Younger victims of crime were more likely to seek victim services for crime in general, as well as for property and identity crimes in particular:
 38
• Almost a quarter (23%) of all victims aged 18 to 34 sought victim services, while only 7% of 
those victims ages 35 and older sought services.
• Younger victims of property crime, aged 18 to 34, were more likely to seek victim services; 
22% of them reported that they sought services from an organization at least once, compared  
with 3% of property crime victims aged 35 and above.
• Identity crime victims under age 45 were more likely to seek victim services, at a rate of 19%, 
than those age 45 and over, at a rate of 7%.

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Race/Ethnicity 
The survey asked respondents to select the one category which best describes their race from the following 
categories: 
•	 American Indian
•	 Asian
•	 Bi-racial or multi-racial
•	 Black and/or African American
•	 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
•	 White/Caucasian
•	 Other (respondent could write in another category)
Respondents were asked in a separate question whether they were Hispanic/Latino. Due to the small 
number of minority races and ethnicities represented in Maine, those who chose a race other than White 
and those who chose Hispanic/Latino were combined into one group for analysis. For ease of reference, 
this group is referred to as “persons of color” throughout this report.
Crime Disparity
Persons of color were more likely to be the victim of every type of crime except identity crimes, as follows:39
•	 Overall , persons of color were more likely than non-Hispanic White persons to experience at least 
one type of victimization, at a rate of 51% compared with 33%.
•	 Persons of color were more likely to have experienced  rape  over their lifetime, at 36%, than non-
Hispanic White persons, at 22%. 
•	 Persons of color were twice as likely to have experienced  stalking  (31%) than non-Hispanic White 
persons (15%).
•	 Persons of color also reported a higher rate of  property crime  (20%) compared with non-Hispanic 
White respondents (8%).
•	 Persons of color were nearly three times as likely to be threatened  with violence than their non-
Hispanic White counterparts (19% compared with 6%).
•	 Persons of color were more likely to have been the victim of a hate crime , at 17%, compared with 
non-Hispanic White persons, at 6%.

Victims of color were more likely to report crimes against them in general and more likely to report property 
crimes and identity crimes in particular: 40 
•	 Victims of color were more likely to report any crime  to law enforcement, at a rate of 59%, 
compared with a rate of 29% for non-Hispanic White victims. 
•	 Victims of color were more likely to report property crime  to law enforcement, with a rate of

•	 Victims of color were more likely to report identity crime  to law enforcement, at a rate of 58%, 
compared with non-Hispanic White victims, at a rate of 16%.
Seeking Victim Services
For most types of crime, victims of color and White victims sought services for those crimes at similar rates. 
An exception occurs, however, for threats of violence: 41
•	 Non-Hispanic White victims of threatening crimes sought victim services at a rate of 25%; this 
is in sharp contrast to victims of color, none of whom (0%) sought victim services following 
crimes of threatening.

Household Income
Respondents were asked to indicate their total household income from all sources, and could choose from 
one of the following categories: 
•	 Less than $25,000
•	 $25,000 to $49,999
•	 $50,000 to $74,999
•	 $75,000 to $99,999
•	 $100,000 or more
Crime Disparity 
While those with higher household incomes were more likely to be the victim of identity crimes, those with 
lower household incomes were more likely to be the victim of most other crimes:45
•	 Respondents with household incomes of less than $75,000 were more likely to experience rape/
attempted rape  in their lifetimes, at 28%, compared with those with lower incomes, at 17%.
•	 Respondents with lower household incomes (less than $50,000) were more likely to experience 
stalking , at 22%, while those with higher household incomes ($50,000 or more), were less likely to 
experience stalking, at 13%.
•	 Identity crimes , on the other hand, were experienced at a higher rate by those with higher 
household incomes. A total of 20% of respondents with household incomes of $75,000 or more 
were the victim of an identity crime compared with 14% of respondents with household incomes 
under $75,000.
•	 Respondents with household incomes of under $25,000 were more likely to experience domestic 
violence , at 14%, compared with those with higher incomes, at 4%.
•	 Those with household incomes under $50,000 were more likely to suspect or believe they were 
targeted for their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity. One out of every ten victims 
(10%) with lower incomes suspected or believed they were the victim of a hate crime , compared 
with 4% of those with higher incomes.
•	 In addition, those with lower household incomes (less than $75,000) were  threatened  with 
violence at a higher rate (10%) than those with higher incomes (4%).
•	 While few respondents indicated that they were victims of  violent crime , a disproportionate 
number of them came from households with lower incomes. Approximately 8% of those with 
household incomes of less than $50,000 experienced a violent crime, compared with 4% of those 
with higher incomes.
•	 Respondents with household incomes of under $25,000 were more likely to have been a victim of 
trafficking  in their lifetime, at 6%, than those with higher incomes, at 3%.

Location
Zip codes reported by respondents were broadly categorized as urban/suburban or rural using RUCA 
classification (see Methodology). Zip codes were also mapped to their respective counties.
Crime Disparity
Respondents from urban/suburban areas were more likely to experience two serious types of crime:47,48
 Urban/suburban respondents experienced  domestic violence  more frequently than their rural 
counterparts, at rates of 7% and 4%, respectively. 
 Urban/suburban respondents had a higher rate of  violent crimes  (7%) compared with rural respondents 
(2%). 
Crime rates also varied by county:
 Cumberland49
o Cumberland respondents were less likely, at 1%, than those from all other counties, at 6%, to 
experience violent crime .
o Cumberland respondents were less likely, at 3%, than those from all other counties, at 7%, to 
experience hate crimes .
o Cumberland respondents were more likely, at 12%, than those from all other counties, at 8%, to 
experience property crime .
 Kennebec50
o Kennebec respondents were more likely, at 15%, than those from all other counties, at 5%, to 
experience domestic violence .
 Penobscot51
o Penobscot respondents were more likely, at 10%, than those from all other counties, at 5%, to 
experience domestic violence . 
o Penobscot respondents were more likely, at 13%, than those from all other counties, at 4%, to 
experience violent crime . 
o Penobscot respondents were more likely, at 12%, than those from all other counties, at 7%, to 
experience threatening .
o Penobscot respondents were more likely, at 12%, than those form all other counties, at 6%, to 
experience hate crime .
 York52
o Respondents from York were less likely than respondents from other counties to experience 
domestic violence ; in fact, fewer than 1% of York respondents reported experiencing domestic 
violence, while 7% of respondents from all other counties did so. 
47 These findings held true even aft  er controlling for age, income, and race/ethnicity.

Victims from urban and rural areas reported crime to law enforcement at similar rates. Victims of identity 
crimes from two counties, however, reported those crimes at rates different from other counties:53
• The overall rate of reporting to law enforcement for all counties was 21%. Victims of identity
crime in Penobscot County, however, were less likely to report the crime to law enforcement,
at 3%, and victims of identity crime in Kennebec County were more likely to report the identitycrime, at 46%.
Seeking Victim Services
Urban victims of crime were more likely to seek victim services for crime in general as well as for property crime in particular:
54 
• Overall, victims living in an urban/suburban area were more likely to reach out to organizations
than victims in small town/rural areas, with rates of 16% and 6%, respectively.
• Nearly one in seven (17%) urban/suburban property crime victims reached out to a victimservices organization, while none of the rural property crime victims did so (0%).

Relationship Status
The survey asked respondents “What is your marital status?”  and provided the following list of responses, 
with instructions to select one:
•	 Single, never married
•	 Married
•	 Divorced
•	 Widowed
•	 Separated
•	 Unmarried, cohabitating
Responses from this list were condensed into two categories: partnered (married or unmarried, 
cohabitating) and unpartnered ( single, divorced, widowed, or separated ). 
Crime Disparity
There were differences between partnered and unpartnered respondents for a number of crime rates, 
and in most instances, unpartnered respondents reported higher rates of victimization than those with 
partners.55 It bears mentioning, however, that relationship status is correlated with both household income 
and age. Older respondents tend to have higher household incomes than younger respondents, and they 
are more likely to be partnered. The correlation between relationship status and three types of crimes—
property, identity, and hate crimes—disappears after controlling for income and age.
•	 Unpartnered respondents were more likely to experience a rape/attempted rape in their 
lifetime, at 30%, compared with those who are partnered, at 19%.
•	 Unpartnered respondents were more likely to be the victims of stalking,  at 22%, compared 
with partnered respondents, at 13%.
•	 Unpartnered respondents were less likely than their partnered counterparts to be the victims 
of identity crime  (13% vs. 19%).
•	 At 12%, unpartnered respondents experienced domestic violence  at a higher rate than 
partnered respondents, at 2%. 
•	 Unpartnered respondents were also more likely to be the victims of property crime , at 12%, 
compared with partnered respondents, at 7%.
•	 Unpartnered respondents were more likely to experience  threats  of violence than their 
partnered counterparts (at 11% and 5%, respectively).

Reporting to Law Enforcement
Unpartnered victims were more likely to report crimes to law enforcement:56 
•	 Overall , about 39% of unpartnered victims reported any crime to law enforcement, compared 
with 28% of partnered victims.
Seeking Victim Services
Unpartnered victims were more likely to seek victim services for crime in general, as well as for threats of 
violence and stalking in particular:57 
•	 Overall , unpartnered victims of crime had a higher rate (17%) of seeking victim services than 
victims who were partnered (10%). 
•	 Unpartnered victims of threatening were more likely, at 28%, to seek victim services than 
partnered victims of threatening , at 7%.
•	 Unpartnered victims of stalking contacted service organizations at a higher rate (16%) than 
partnered victims of stalking (5%).

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
According to the findings of this study, crime directly impacted one out of every three adults in the state 
of Maine in 2021. A little less than one in three victims reported the crime to law enforcement, and only 
about one in eight sought some type of assistance from victim services. 
Thus, the majority of crimes go unreported, and the majority of victims receive no 
assistance from Maine’s victim services organizations. The reasons for not reporting 
crime and seeking assistance were not explored in the current study and likely vary 
depending on the type of crime. In the case of identity crimes, it is possible that 
victims reported elsewhere—to financial institutions, for example. 
Victims may also avoid reporting crimes to protect the perpetrator.58 This is most likely when the 
perpetrator is a loved one—a domestic partner or family member—and the crime is domestic violence. In 
fact, one out of six victims identified in this study were domestic violence victims. This metric downplays 
the role of domestic violence in Maine because those who experienced this domestic violence experience 
more types of crime—3.2 types, in fact, compared with 1.2 types reported by other victims. Furthermore, 
the three types of crimes a domestic violence victim was likely to experience were stalking, threats of 
violence, and violence (i.e., robbery, assault, sexual assault, and rape/attempted rape), while the one 
crime other victims were most likely to experience was identity crime. In other words, domestic violence 
is, as the terms denotes, more threatening and violent than most crimes. While this is stating the 
obvious, familiarity with a term can blunt its meaning over time, and studies such as this one provide an 
opportunity to draw attention to the violence inherent in this type of crime. 
This study also sought to understand the extent of hate crimes in Maine. According to the Department 
of Public Safety’s annual Crime in Maine reports, the number of reported hate crimes has increased 
substantially in recent years, from 19 in 2019 to 83 in 2020, a 337% increase.59,60 These victims were 
targeted due to their race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation or identity. As may be expected, given 
this definition of hate crime, this study found that a disproportionate number of hate crime victims were 
persons of color; persons of color make up about 8% of Maine’s adult population but made up 22% of its 
hate crime victims. A disproportionate number were also female; females make up about 52% of Maine’s 
adult population but made up 65% of its hate crime victims.Summary

2022 MAINE CRIME VICTIMIZATION  REPORT
Due to space constraints, this study’s survey did not ask about religion or sexual orientation. While it did ask 
about gender identity, too few people reported in the nonbinary or “other” category to allow for analysis. The 
Maine SAC will be releasing a report focused on hate crime reporting in the near future.61
The disproportionate representation of persons of color is not unique to hate crime. Persons of color were 
more likely to be the victim of any and every type of crime except identity crime, and this remained true even 
after controlling for differences in income. While one out of every three non-Hispanic White people in Maine 
were victimized in the last 12 months, one out of every two persons of color were victimized. The differences 
in rates vary from one type of crime to another, but rates are most divergent when looking at violent crime. 
Persons of color were four times as likely as non-Hispanic Whites to be the victim of a violent crime in Maine 
last year. 
Violent crimes are relatively infrequent in Maine, and that fact combined with the state’s small population 
makes it difficult to look at the specific crimes (robbery, assault, sexual assault, and rape/attempted rape) 
in depth. However, while the rate of violent victimization is small, the absolute number of victims is not; 
thousands of people were directly victimized with violence in a single year. Furthermore, these crimes 
have a profound impact on society due to the economic toll (e.g., missed work), health care utilization 
(e.g., emergency room visits), and governmental services (e.g., increase law enforcement presence). A 
comprehensive accounting would also include the impact on secondary (indirect) victims as well as the long-
term impacts of violence. 
It is the hope of this research team that these findings will be used to inform the direction of resources to 
both prevent crime and to improve the provision of services to those who are victimized.
