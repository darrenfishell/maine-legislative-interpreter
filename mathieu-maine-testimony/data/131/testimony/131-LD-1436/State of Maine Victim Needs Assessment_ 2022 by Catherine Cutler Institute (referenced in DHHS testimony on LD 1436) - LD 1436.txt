Dear Reader:  
The r eport you hold i s the culmination of a n eeds a ssessment of d irect v ictim services funded b y 
Victims o f Crime  Act (VOCA) in the  state  of Maine. We, researchers at the  Catherine Cu tler Institute,  
were contracted to c onduct this assessment by the  Office  of Child and Family Services (OCFS) within 
the Department of Health and Human Services.  
In our role a s researchers, w e are data c ollectors, meanin g ma kers, and producers of information . 
Across our w ork, our g oal is to help a gencies, or ganizations, a nd communities thrive  in a changing 
world by t ranslating k nowledge and best p ractices i nto s ustainable s olutions t hat are responsive  to 
societal n eeds a nd focused on both s hort-term a nd long -term o utcomes. W hile we strive to do this 
objectively, w e acknowledge  that inherent b ias e xists w ithin any r esearch and that i t can never b e 
truly n eutral. As a t eam of predominantly w hite, educated,  middle -class r esearchers w orking a t an 
institute o f higher e ducation,  our ex periences a nd our p ositions i n society u ndoubtedly i nfluence  our 
approaches,  understandings, a nd interpretations o f reality.  
Furthermore, w hile some of u s have historical exp erience  providing support t o victims o f crimes, and 
all of us have  experience  in collecting an d analyzing data, w e as researchers o perate  outside  the 
complicated, m ulti-layered s ystems s erving v ictims of crime across Maine. W hile o ur work b rings u s 
into c ontact w ith these s ystem s, we do n ot have t he same comprehensiv e understanding o f how 
services are  delivered across t his system . 
We also w ish to caution t he reader t hat t his is a needs assessment, a nd as such i t focuses p rimarily 
on the identification of needs. Prioritizing this focus within budgetary and timeline  constraints 
necessarily came at the expense of painting a comprehensive  picture  of service delivery in Maine. 
Our report does not focus on what services are  provided,  where  they are  provided, by whom, nor i n 
what quantity or quality; i t does not i nclude law e nforcement, court,  or prosecutorial data. This 
poses a limitation, and we encourage readers to search out other sources to complete  their 
understanding of the vital services being provide d across the  state. Specifically, we  point readers to 
the Maine  Coalition to  End Domestic Violence and the  Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault,  both 
of which e ngage  in data collection. Their reports o ffer more  detailed i nformation o f the member 
centers they represent and the crime survivors they serve. 
These  limitations notwithstanding, w e believ e we have  achieved our g oal o f demonstrating the s cope 
of criminal v ictimization i n Maine and i n identifying a nd assessing t he needs o f crime  survivors a nd 
the providers w ho serve them. W e likewise believe  we have balanced t he desire  to provid e a b road 
picture  of those n eeds against t he desire  to capture  details that a re too often missed w ith a wide 
lens. W e were particularly concerned t o describe  the exp eriences of underrepresented g roups, who 
have t he highest r ates of victimization i n Maine a nd are often r endered i nvisible  by traditional 
quantitative  data collection m ethods. W e sought to mitigate  this b y employing focus g roups and 
small g roup in terviews w ith m ainstream and c ulturally s pecific providers t o gain f irsthand a ccounts 
and k nowledge  about w hat c ould b e improved u pon in terms o f victim s ervices. 
In closing , we have  tried t o be t ransparent i n our methods, and w e welcome  your feedback o n this 
report. You  bring your own perspective and i nterpretation to this needs assessment, whether you  are 
a practitioner, survivor,  fulfill another role  within the system, o r are  reading this from general 
interest.  We remind practitioners, decision makers, and funders to consider additional contexts 
when u sing our data, findings, and recommendations as they seek to allocate  limited resources 
while centering the rights of victims. Our aim i s for this report to serve  as a springboard for 
thoughtful and collaborative  dialogue that will produce an evidence  base that, i n turn, yields the 
best outcomes for victims in Maine.

Executive Summary
The 2022 State of Maine Victim Needs Assessment was 
created to inform Maine Department of Health and 
Human Services (DHHS) leaders of the current needs of 
crime victims and to recommend strategies for meeting 
those needs in accordance with Victims of Crime Act 
(VOCA) requirements. 
VOCA is a federal grant program authorized by the Office 
for Victims of Crime (OVC) of the U.S. Department of 
Justice’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP). Each state 
receives funds for the financial support of eligible crime 
victim assistance programs. 
Maine’s victim service providers use these funds for direct 
services for crime victims and have achieved notable 
successes. 
There are also areas in need of improvement and those 
changes should be guided by this assessment’s key 
findings related to:
1. Crime victims and characteristics of those most 
affected by crime;
2. Victim service providers and their insights into 
promising practices and gaps; and 
3. The perspectives of crime victims, the service 
recipients.

STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Methods
Researchers from the Catherine Cutler Institute at the University of Southern Maine employed a mixed-
methods approach to gather data between October 2021 and March 2022. This assessment is organized by 
the phases of that research and includes:
•	 Maine Crime Victimization Survey (MCVS)
•	 Online Victim Service Provider Survey (VSPS)
•	 Online Victim Needs Questionnaire (VNQ)
•	 Focus groups and key informant interviews.
The first phase (the MCVS) was used to understand the context of crime in Maine by crime type, 
demographic characteristics of victims experiencing crime, and if they sought services. The second phase 
was to gather data from service providers (VSPS), victims’ firsthand accounts of their experiences (VNQ), 
and focus groups and interviews with key stakeholders to gain insights into promising practices and gaps. 
The corresponding data sets were analyzed to determine overall findings and recommendations.
Key Findings 
Key findings are presented as they relate to the lessons learned about crime victims, victim service 
providers, and the administrators of VOCA funds.
Crime Victims – 6 Findings
•	 Crime directly impacted one out of every three adults in the state of Maine in 2021.
•	 The majority of crimes in Maine go unreported, and the majority of victims did not seek assistance 
from Maine’s victim services organizations.
•	 Just over one-third of crime victims experienced two or more types of crime.
•	 Persons of color were more likely to be the victim of any and every type of crime except identity 
crime, and this remained true even after controlling for differences in income.
•	 Nearly one in five crime victims who reported having experienced any type of crime in the previous 
12 months reported that at least one crime was committed by a current or former domestic partner 
or family member.
•	 Young adult Mainers (ages 18-34) reported experiencing more victimization than older Mainers and 
are more likely to report crime to law enforcement.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • 3 STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Service Providers – 5 Findings
 Victim service providers need more formal training opportunities, generally, and that specifically 
address services and outreach strategies for meeting the needs of diverse populations.
 Victim service providers are routinely not serving or are inadequately serving Maine’s diverse 
populations.
 VOCA-funded services provided most oft  en are criminal/civil justice assistance and information 
and referral services.
 The lack of culturally accessible services, language-accessible services, and transportation for 
victims to access services are the most frequently cited barriers to service for Maine crime victims.
 Core victim services are negatively aff  ected by a lack of funding to pay for needed staff  ing, the 
inability to retain existing staff  , and a lack of training opportunities for staff   and volunteers.
Administration of VOCA Funds – 5 Findings
 DHHS methods for determining VOCA funding allocations are not adequately meeting the needs of 
all crime victims. 
 DHHS funding decisions and current VOCA allocation practices favor mainstream organizations to 
the detriment of diverse populations and emerging programs that off  er more culturally relevant 
and population-specific services for crime victims.
 More resources are needed to support and expand essential victim services provided by victim 
service providers. Crime victims will continue to have their needs unmet, especially those from underserved communities, unless administrative infrastructure is strengthened to reduce staff   
turnover and other factors that aff  ect the quality of victim services.
 Maine is the only state in the U.S. that does not have an option for victims of violent crime to 
participate in an automated notification system for updates on off  ender custody and criminal case 
status. Victim service providers noted some concerns about statewide consistency in timeliness and accuracy of current victim notification processes.
 Restitution is a remedy in criminal law that directs a defendant to pay a victim a designated 
amount to compensate for losses. The poverty rate in Maine contributes to the failure of off  enders 
to pay restitution, with many crime victims unable to recoup losses.

STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Recommendations
This study revealed concerns about the unmet needs of crime victims. Some types of crime typically 
affect a small percentage of a large segment of the population, while some very small segments of the 
population are much more heavily victimized by multiple types of crime. Providing funds for services that 
will partially or fully satisfy the needs of the many and the few is truly a challenge. This study has found 
that people of color (often individuals connected to Maine’s immigrant and refugee communities or Tribal 
members) are more likely to experience almost every type of crime. While rates for reporting crime and 
seeking service are higher for these victims, victim service providers and stakeholders flagged gaps in 
the provision of culturally competent services. Victim service providers also noted that resources are not 
allocated adequately for improvements to be made under the current structure.
The following recommendations begin by offering specific guidance to Maine’s VOCA State Administering 
Agency, OCFS at DHHS, and conclude with broader recommendations for the state agencies, coalitions, 
and councils that oversee and collaborate around the federal, state, and local funding sources that address 
the needs of Maine crime victims. The fully detailed recommendations begin on page 90 .
1. Redesign the VOCA funding allocation process to ensure the distribution of 
funds to victim service organizations commensurate with the changing needs 
of victims receiving services from those organizations.
2. Prioritize VOCA funding for increased support of core victim services and for 
regional, population, and culturally specific programs.
3. Establish a VOCA-funded statewide electronic notification system.
4. Fund a permanent Victim Witness Advocate Coordinator position to provide 
continued statewide support and coordination of Victim Witness Advocates.
5. Explore options for generating additional funds to provide restitution to Maine 
crime victims.
6. Engage a diverse group of stakeholders to establish a new decision-making 
process based on statewide strategic planning that addresses coordination 
of overlapping funding (e.g., VOCA, STOP , FVSPA, etc.) and efforts to meet the 
ongoing and changing needs of crime victims.
Introduction
5The 2022 State of Maine Victim Needs Assessment 
summarizes the results of a comprehensive research effort 
to assess the needs of crime victims in the state of Maine 
and the resources available to help them. 
The research was conducted by the University of Southern 
Maine’s Catherine Cutler Institute for Health and Social 
Policy for the state’s Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS) Office of Child and Family Services 
(OCFS). 
DHHS is dedicated to promoting health, safety, resilience, 
and opportunity for Maine’s residents and is responsible 
for administering the grant program authorized by the 
federal Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA). 
The findings summarized in this report are intended to 
inform the distribution of those grant funds, as well as 
other grant-funded programs and services that respond to 
the needs of victims and their service providers.
Introduction  • 6
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Background
VOCA Victim Assistance Program
The grant program authorized by VOCA is run by 
the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) of the U.S. 
Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs 
(OJP). VOCA funds are non-taxpayer monies 
that are generated by criminal fines, forfeited 
bail bonds, penalties, and some private funding. 
Formula grants are provided annually to each state 
and eligible territory for the financial support of 
eligible crime victim assistance programs. Each 
chosen program becomes a sub-recipient of the 
state’s formula grant, receiving a portion of the 
state’s award.1
Each state and territory’s administering agency 
must periodically perform a needs assessment 
to determine how best to use its share of federal 
funding. This required assessment should identify 
the types of services crime victims currently 
receive, pinpoint gaps in services; reveal factors 
that discourage victims from accessing services, 
document new or developing needs related to 
changing demographics and changes in criminal 
activity, and coordinate funding decisions across 
multiple state and federal funding.2 VOCA statute 
requires that a minimum of 10 percent of each 
state’s funds be allocated to programs that serve 
previously underserved populations of victims 
of violent crime, to be identified by type of crime 
victimizations and/or demographic characteristics.3

4 The definition of “direct services” is defined by VOCA. There is some variance according to type of entity, state and federal statutes, and 
other funding requirements, however, each victim service provider adheres to their entity’s “core practices” for the provision of these 
essential victim services. For example, victim service providers from sexual assault support centers’ core victim services include 24/7 
confidential helpline, support groups, referrals to civil legal representation, medical, civil, and criminal systems accompaniment. Victim 
service providers who are Victim Witness Advocates provide core victim services that that include phone support, status updates and 
notifications, criminal systems accompaniment, and referrals to other services. Direct services are efforts that:
• Respond to the emotional, psychological, or 
physical needs of crime victims;
• Assist crime victims stabilize their lives after 
crime victimization;
• Assist crime victims to understand and 
participate in the criminal justice system; or
• Restore a measure of security and safety for 
crime victims.4
Victim service providers are entities that receive grant 
funds under the Violence Prevention Program and:
• Operate by a public agency or nonprofit 
organization, or a combination of such agencies 
or organizations, and provide Direct Services to 
crime victims;
• Has demonstrated the provision of effective 
services to crime victims via support of its 
Direct Services by the community, its history 
of providing Direct Services in a cost-effective 
manner, and the breadth of depth of its 
financial support other than the department; or 
substantial financial support from sources other 
than the Department;
• Utilizes volunteers in providing services to 
Victims of Crime, unless this requirement is 
waived;
• Assists crime victims seeking Victim 
Compensation Program benefits; and
• Does not discriminate against crime victims 
because they disagree with the way the state is 
prosecuting the criminal case.
VOCA-Funded Projects must provide services:
• At no charge to the crime victim;
• Regardless of the crime victim’s participation in 
the criminal justice process; and 
• Regardless of crime victim’s immigration status.

STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Victim Service Needs Assessment
DHHS is the VOCA State Administering Agency (SAA) for Maine, and the agency’s Office of Child and Family 
Services (OCFS) is the distributor of the funds and required to develop the allocation plan and document 
its process for distributing the funds among victim assistance programs, per VOCA guidelines.
A recent national study of a select number of state VOCA needs assessments was conducted by the 
Center for Victim Research. The study provided recommendations for how VOCA needs assessments are 
conducted and called attention to VOCA rules outlining the importance of overall strategic planning.5 
VOCA is one of several funding sources that address the overlapping needs of crime victims and encourage 
coordination and collaboration among relevant federal, state, and local agencies to improve services. STOP 
(Services, Training, Officers, and Prosecutors) Formula Grant funding, under the Violence Against Women 
Act, requires consultation with state VOCA administrators in the development of an implementation plan. 
The Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program also requires that state administrators formulate a statewide 
strategic plan for resource allocation, among other requirements.
Maine’s Department of Public Safety is the SAA for both the STOP and Byrne JAG federal awards. In addition 
to VOCA, DHHS administers federal funding for the Sexual Assault Services Formula Grant (SASP Formula), 
Rape Prevention and Education (RPE) program, and Family Violence and Prevention Services Act (FVPSA), 
while the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Maine manages Victim Witness Services to 
victims and witnesses of federal crime. Many of the same Maine leaders and state officials are involved in 
these overlapping efforts and already engage in meaningful collaboration and coordination. This VOCA 
needs assessment therefore aims to support this ongoing work and aid future funding decisions for the 
provision of VOCA as well as all the other relevant federal and state funding sources that address the needs 
of crime victims. This coordination is increasingly important as expanding victim needs outpace available 
federal and state funding.
The importance of a needs assessment in Maine was highlighted in the 2019 audit of the OJP Victim 
Assistance Grants awarded to Maine DHHS. The audit, conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice 
Office of the Inspector General (OIG), included findings that DHHS had not conducted a required 
statewide strategic plan or needs assessment in accordance with VOCA grant requirements and that 
that omission increased the risk of “not providing assistance to unidentified classes of victims, impaired 
its ability to identify underserved victims, and did not ensure that the distribution of funds to victim 
service organizations were commensurate with the changing needs of victims receiving services from 
those organizations.”6 In August 2019, Maine’s DHHS Commissioner, Jeanne Lambrew issued a response, 
noting that the department would complete a statewide and comprehensive victim needs assessment to 
inform a funding allocation strategy in accordance with VOCA guidance, among other recommendations 
that would be implemented. In August 2020, DHHS issued a Request for Proposals for a Victim Services 
Needs Assessment, and in early 2021, DHHS contracted with the Catherine Cutler Institute to conduct that 
assessment.

STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
The assessment was required to gather information from a variety of sources to identify the needs of 
crime victims in the state of Maine and the resources available to help them. There was also interest in 
learning more about victim service providers’ strengths, promising practices, and obstacles, as well as their 
understanding of unmet needs of crime victims.
After the Institute was selected to conduct the assessment, the initial project period was extended, and 
a Maine Crime Victimization Survey (MCVS) was added to the contract. The purpose of the MCVS was to 
collect data to help understand the extent of victimization, crime reporting, and assistance seeking, as 
well as variations in crime rates between demographic groups. OCFS also added funding to the contract 
to expand outreach efforts to culturally specific and underserved populations. This expansion included 
additional focus groups and key stakeholder interviews and having the MCVS and VNQ surveys as well as 
the assessment’s Executive Summary translated into Arabic, French, Portuguese, Somali, and Spanish to 
ensure they were more readily accessible to a diverse cross-section of Maine’s population.
In the fall of 2021, the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MECASA) provided additional funds to 
augment the crime victimization survey to include more questions on lifetime sexual assault, human 
trafficking, and domestic violence. This funding supported research staff time generally and specifically 
for the data analysis related to the added questions. It also provided the means for the research team 
to generate a separate report, 2022 Maine Crime Victimization Report: Informing Public Policy for Safer 
Communities. 
Neither OCFS nor MECASA staff were directly involved in data gathering efforts or analysis for the MCVS. 
However, the research activities supported by the previously detailed additional funding helped generate a 
larger response rate for the MCVS, increasingly the likelihood that the survey sample was representative of 
Maine’s population.
Population and Demographics of Maine
Geography - Maine is a largely rural state with an overall population of 1.36 million residents. Maine’s 
population density varies widely across its counties. Washington County, for example, has a population 
density of 12.8 people per square mile, while Cumberland County has a density of 337.2. Most Maine 
residents live in rural towns and small cities. In these locales, limited public transportation, longer 
distances to services, and a lack of anonymity and security often add to the burden on crime victims.
Introduction  • 9
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Race and Ethnicity  - According to the 2020 census, most Mainers identify as White (91%). However, 
over the last decade, almost all (95%) of Maine’s total population growth has been due to non-White 
populations.7,8,9 Even though individuals that identify as Black/African American make up a relatively small 
percentage of the state’s population, this percentage has almost quadrupled in twenty years, climbing from 
0.5% in 2000 to 1.9% in 2020. Additionally, an estimated 87,217 immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers 
live throughout Maine and newly arrived asylum seekers are predominantly Black, African.10 Relatedly, 
Maine’s two largest cities Portland and Lewiston, continue to be more diverse than much of the rest of the 
state with 15.4% of Portland’s residents and 13.4% of Lewiston’s residents identify as a race other than 
White. In 2019, 34% of Portland’s public school students and 28% of Lewiston’s public school students did 
not use English as their primary language. 11,12
Native Americans have been living in the land now known as Maine for thousands of years. The four 
federally recognized tribal nations that form the Wabanaki Alliance are the Aroostook Band of Mi’kmaq, 
Houlton Band of Maliseet, Passamaquoddy Tribe, and Penobscot Nation. The proportion of the state’s 
Indigenous population is under 1% (0.7%) with currently fewer than 10,000 enrolled members of tribal 
nations.13
Age - Maine has the oldest median age in the country. Over one-fifth of the population is over the age of 
65 and Maine’s median age rose 1.9 years from 2010 to 2019.14 Studies indicate that one out of ten adults 
aged 60 and older have experienced abuse in the past year, and that over 40,000 Mainers aged 60 and older 
experienced some form of abuse in 2020.15,16  It is also estimated that 9% of those 65 and over live below 
the poverty line.17

Introduction  • 10
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Poverty - Poverty remains a reality throughout the state. One in nine Mainers (11%) are living below the 
poverty line, with northern Maine counties tending to have higher poverty rates than the more populous 
southern counties.18 Studies have shown that individuals living at or below the poverty line have more than 
double the rate of violent victimization as persons in high-income households.19 In 2018, 37% of Mainers 
who identified as Black or African Americans lived below the poverty level, as well as 34% of American 
Indians, 21% of Hispanic or Latinos, and 12% of those identifying as White or Asian.20
Crime Rate in Maine
Historically, Maine’s crime rates have been considerably lower than the U.S. rates. In 2020, crime in 
Maine decreased 6.1% making 2020 the ninth consecutive year violent crime had decreased in Maine.21 
While domestic violence assault decreased by 6% in 2020, domestic violence is typically underreported. 
Furthermore, there is no single index for domestic violence, and the violent crimes that are typically 
committed in a domestic setting—threatening, terrorizing, violating protection from abuse orders, etc.—are 
not included in index crime rates. In 2020, 489 incidents of rape were reported which is a decrease from 
2019. Yet, this decrease likely indicates a decrease in reporting to law enforcement as there was not a 
decrease in number of victims accessing Maine’s sexual assault hotline.22
A 2019 survey of all Maine high schools students, conducted by Maine DHHS and Maine Department of 
Education, indicated that 10.8% of high school girls and 4.0% of high school boys responded “yes” when 
asked, “Have you been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when you did not want to?” with higher 
rates for students who were American Indian or Alaskan Native (girls 21.3%, boys 5.3%), Hispanic (girls 
17.0%, boys 8.2%), Black or African American (girls 12.5%, boys 6.6%), and multiple races (girls 15.0%, boys 
8.5%). The highest rates were for students who identified as gay/lesbian (18.7%) and transgender (29.5%).23 
Lastly, federal crime data statistics of hate crimes reported in Maine show a total of 83 incidents in 2020, 
which was an increase from those reported in previous years.24

STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Needs Assessment Overview
The Catherine Cutler Institute and its Survey Research Center (SRC) employed a mixed methods approach to 
gather comprehensive data about the current status of victim services in Maine. This approach included four 
projects:
•	 Maine Crime Victimization Survey (MCVS)
•	 Online Victim Service Provider Survey (VSPS)
•	 Online Victim Needs Questionnaire (VNQ)
•	 Focus groups and key informant interviews
The Institute research team deployed these four projects to ensure rigorous data collection that would 
elevate the direct experience of victims and the voices of practitioners in order to identify holistic findings 
and recommendations. The survey instruments were based on pre-established questions from previously 
deployed crime victimization surveys, the National Census of Victim Service Providers, and the National 
Survey of Victim Service Providers. The VSPS, VNQ, focus groups, and key informant interviews also utilized 
a researcher-practitioner approach, engaging partners like the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault, 
Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence, Immigrant Resource Center of Maine, and the Office of the Maine 
Attorney General in question development and participant outreach efforts. 
OCFS staff reviewed and approved all evaluation tools prior to their implementation as well as helped 
identify VOCA grantees and non-VOCA contacts to engage in survey and interview efforts. Throughout the 
project, the Institute provided OCFS with narrative reports that outlined work completed at various stages 
of the project, as well as proposed next steps, as detailed in the overall work plan. While OCFS staff provided 
administrative oversight and engaged in regular status updates from the project team, OCFS staff did not 
participate in surveys, interviews, data analysis, or the development of findings and recommendations. 
This needs assessment report begins by presenting the 2022 Maine Crime Victimization Survey methodology 
and findings in order to establish the extent of criminal victimization in Maine ( Chapter 1 ). The 2022 MCVS 
is the fourth crime victimization survey the Institute has conducted for the state of Maine over the last 20 
years. The survey, patterned after the National Crime Victimization Survey, gathered data about respondents’ 
experiences with various crimes over the previous 12 months, including crimes that were not reported to 
law enforcement, as well as demographic characteristics of respondents. While the 2022 MCVS was modified 
slightly from the previous iteration, findings from this need assessment include comparisons between them 
whenever appropriate.
After establishing the parameters of victimization in Maine, the assessment next details the methodology and 
findings of the VSPS, VNQ, focus groups, and key informant interviews ( Chapter 2 ). These data collectively 
present a granular look at vital components such as victim service delivery and accessibility, outreach 
and awareness, and if victims’ needs were met. While the data are not representative of all crime victims 
and data limitations will be detailed, the Institute research team  aimed to include a broad cross-section of 
crime victims and service providers in the deployment of these surveys and interviews. Lastly, the results 
from all four data sources are synthesized into key findings for crime victims, service providers, and the 
administration of VOCA funds, and six recommendations are presented ( Chapter 3 ).

STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Overall Challenges 
While the research team aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of crime victims’ needs according to 
geographic region and availability of existing services, more detailed findings are not possible due to a 
relatively small number of victim service providers in the state and an even smaller number of them who 
engaged in this assessment. Maine’s overall crime rate is low and the rate of victims seeking services is even 
lower. Therefore, it was challenging to determine regional trends based on small numbers. Crime victims 
and victim service providers did reveal some barriers as to why services are not sought, however, further 
exploration is needed to more fully understand why victims are not reporting and/or seeking current 
services.
Once there is a more detailed understanding of these victims’ needs, resources should be adjusted 
accordingly. Attention should be paid to crime type, regional differences, and demographic characteristics, 
so victim service providers and other community-based program leaders can adapt their outreach, referral, 
and programs to better meet regional and population-specific needs.
While the research team worked to incorporate many voices into the research 
design, we recognize that applied research is never truly neutral. As a team of 
educated, middle-class, White professionals, our cultural perspectives and implicit 
biases are unintentionally influenced by our experiences and privilege, especially while 
working within an institution of higher education. While the team acted intentionally 
to mitigate these risks throughout the study, we must acknowledge them. Future 
research efforts should strive for more diverse perspectives at the center of project 
development and throughout design, implementation, analysis, and recommendations.

be used to inform the direction of resources to improve the 
provision of services to those who are victimized.

MCVS Methodology
In order to obtain a random sample of Maine residents for the MCVS, the Institute research team obtained 
an address-based sample frame. This frame included addresses for 12,000 Mainers aged 18 and older, 
along with landline and cell phone numbers when available so that follow-up calls could be made. The 
result was a list containing 4,002 records in which a landline number was present, 5,860 records in which 
a cell phone number was present, 1,710 records in which both phone numbers were present, and 3,848 
records in which no phone number was present.
Surveys were mailed out at the beginning of January 2022. The mailing included a cover letter, a two-page 
two-sided survey in English (See full survey in Appendix A), and a postage-paid return envelope. The cover 
letter featured a bold insert containing a list of languages (Arabic, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Somali, 
and English), each translated into its respective language, along with a weblink in the form of a tiny URL 
so respondents could complete the survey online in any of the listed languages. Phone follow-up began 
a week and a half after surveys were mailed, and a total of 3,076 persons were randomly selected and 
called. Interviewers encouraged respondents to complete the survey over the phone, but if respondents 
were not able or willing, interviewers asked them to complete the paper or online version instead. Because 
preliminary analysis of completed surveys showed that respondents were disproportionately older, the 
SRC opted to utilize an online panel26 to obtain more responses from those aged 18 to 34.
The survey was shut down approximately 8 weeks after launch with a total of 1,363 responses. The majority 
of responses, 87% (n=1,181), were mail responses, 5% (n=72) were phone, 4% (n=58) were panel, and 4% 
(n=52) were online. Only two online surveys were completed in a language other than English (one in 
Spanish and one in Arabic). Of the 12,000 surveys mailed, approximately 2,304 (19%) were undeliverable. 
Interviewers called some of these respondents but not all, resulting in a reduction of 1,835 in the sample 
frame and an overall response rate of 13%.27
Point Estimates, Confidence Intervals, and Confidence Levels
The purpose of most surveys is to gain information about a population by questioning a subset (or sample) 
of that population. The rates obtained from this sample are called  point estimates , and these rates very 
accurately reflect the sample’s experiences with victimization. They less precisely describe the overall 
population’s experiences related to victimization. The larger the sample, the greater the likelihood that the 
sample will be representative of the population and the greater the accuracy of the estimates obtained.
26 Online survey panels are made up of people who have agreed to be contacted on a regular basis to share their experiences and 
opinions. Participants are recruited from a wide variety of sources, and researchers can specify the demographics for a particular 
panel (e.g., Maine residents aged 18 to 34). These factors help ensure that the panel will be representative of the population of 
interest.
27 Response rates do not include panel participants in either the numerator or denominator.
Chapter 1  • 15
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
In statistics, the level of precision is typically communicated in terms of confidence levels  and confidence 
intervals . Confidence levels state a level of certainty about the interval. Typically, surveys employ a 95% 
confidence level, which means that there is a one in twenty chance (5%) that the confidence interval 
does not, after all, contain the true population rate. This survey has a 95% confidence level, and (because 
confidence intervals depend upon the number of responses and the distribution of answers) it has 
varying confidence intervals. These intervals are represented visually along with point estimates in graphs 
throughout the report. For the questions answered by the entire sample (n=1,363), the confidence interval 
is ±3%. 
Another issue associated with confidence intervals that bears mentioning here is that when samples are 
small, confidence intervals become large, and they become particularly large when the rates themselves 
are small. There are instances throughout this report where rates appear  to be quite different, but due to 
the small number of responses, it cannot be conclusively stated that they are . 
Weights
In theory, a study utilizing a random sampling design should result in a representative sample, but in 
reality, people respond to recruiting efforts in a way that is not random and which results in a sample that is 
not perfectly representative of the population. Respondents’ non-random self-selection becomes apparent 
when the sample data have demographic distributions that are different from that of the study population.
This is a common occurrence with surveys, and the current survey is no exception. To counteract 
respondents’ non-random self-selection, analysts used a weighting procedure. Survey data were weighted 
in terms of age, gender, household income, race/ethnicity, and county to match Maine’s population 
distributions as described in Census tables.28 The rates reported in this survey are weighted rates unless 
otherwise stated.
RUCA Classification
Urban and non-urban areas in this report were calculated using Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes 
(RUCAs). RUCAs are determined by Census designation, including consideration of population density and 
work commuting patterns, and are approximated to individual zip codes.29
28 Age, gender, household income, and county data were obtained from the American Community Survey (5-year estimates), while 
race/ethnicity were obtained from the 2020 Decennial Census.
29 For more information about RUCAs, see the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service website at https://www.

STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
MCVS Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. Some are the result of the tension that exists in any survey 
between the desire to collect as much data as possible and the need to operate within budget. While 
the final version of the survey asked respondents whether they had experienced each crime one time or 
multiple times, it did not ask for specific numbers. As a result, it is not possible to estimate the number of 
crimes experienced by Mainers, just the number of types of crime (e.g., property, identity, etc.).
Similarly, it is not possible to say which crimes were domestic violence crimes. Respondents who reported 
at least one crime were asked whether any crimes were committed by an intimate partner or family 
member, but they were not asked which  crimes were committed by them when there were multiple crime 
types, as was often the case. This same limitation applies to hate crime—it is not possible to say which 
types of crimes were committed due to a respondent’s race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or gender 
identity when there were multiple crime types, as was also often the case.
Another limitation is the inability to look at respondents aged 18 to 24 separately. This demographic 
was underrepresented in the sample frame and had a poor response rate compared with older adults. 
The panel also did not result in enough respondents within this range to analyze them separately. As a 
result, the youngest age category includes those aged 18 to 34. Also, due to the challenge of obtaining a 
representative sample frame of those younger than 18 and the ethical constraints of surveying them about 
victimization, young people were not included in this study.
MCVS Findings
A total of 1,363 respondents completed the survey. The following table displays both the unweighted and 
weighted distributions by demographic attribute. Note that not every respondent provided responses to 
every demographic question. The proportions reported below are based on the known totals. The known 
proportion appears next to each attribute (E.g., 98% of respondents provided a response to the marital 
status question). To see the questions and crime definitions as they appeared for respondents, please see

STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Survey respondents were asked whether they had been the victim of five different types of crimes over the 
past 12-month period. These types included the following:
•	 Property crime 
•	 Violent crime (including robbery, assault, sexual assault, and rape) 
•	 Threatening with physical violence 
•	 Identity crime
•	 Stalking (including multiple types of stalking behavior)
Respondents who answered in the affirmative were asked two follow-up questions to determine whether 
they had reported the crimes to law enforcement and whether they sought services from a victim service 
organization. Those who reported experiencing crime were asked two more questions to determine 
whether those crimes were hate crimes and/or domestic violence crimes. Finally, respondents were asked 
two questions related to their lifetime experience with rape or human trafficking.

Demographic Characteristics of Victims 
Several demographic attributes were frequently 
associated with victimization regardless of crime 
type. The most frequently observed attributes 
associated with crime were age and race/ethnicity—
younger adults and persons of color were more 
likely to be victimized for every type of crime except 
identity crime. Gender was also frequently associated 
with victimization. Household income was associated 
with some types of victimization, as was location 
(RUCA), and relationship status. 
Several demographic attributes were more frequently associated with reporting crimes to law enforcement 
and seeking victim services. Younger victims, people of color, those without partners, and females were 
more likely to report crimes and seek services than their counterparts. Those with lower household 
incomes were more likely to seek victim services than those in higher income brackets, and those in urban 
or suburban areas were less likely to seek victim services than those in rural locations. 
Age
Crime Disparity
Younger adults were more likely to be the victim of every type of crime except identity crimes: 30 
•	 Overall , respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 were more likely to experience over the 
last 12 months at least one type of victimization (52%) compared with respondents aged 35 
and older (29%). 
•	 Those aged 18 to 34 had a higher rate of lifetime rape/attempted rape , at 32%, compared 
with those aged 35 and over, at 20%. 
•	 Respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 were more likely to have been the victim of 
stalking , at 29%, while their older counterparts had a lower rate, at 13%. 
•	 Those aged 18 to 34 had a higher rate of being threatened  with violence, at 19%, compared 
with those aged 35 and over, at 4%.
•	 Respondents aged 18 to 34 were more likely (18%) to be the victim of property crime  
compared with respondents aged 35 and older (6%). 
•	 Domestic violence  was indicated by a higher percentage of younger adults: those aged 18 to 
34 had a rate of 17%, compared with those aged 35 and older, who had a rate of 2%. Y ounger adults and persons of color were 
more likely to be victimized for every type of 
crime except identity crime. Gender was also 
frequently associated with victimization.

Reporting to Law Enforcement
Younger victims of crime were more likely to report crimes to law enforcement. This was true of crime in 
general and of identity crime in particular:31 
•	 Just over half (52%) of all victims  aged 18 to 34 reported the crime to law enforcement, while 
victims aged 35 and older had a reporting rate of 29%. 
•	 Younger victims of identity crime , aged 18 to 34, had a higher tendency to report that crime, 
at a rate of 47%, compared with victims aged 35 and above, who reported at a rate of 12%.

Seeking Victim Services
Younger victims of crime were more likely to seek victim services for crime in general, as well as for property 
and identity crimes in particular: 32 
•	 Almost a quarter (23%) of all victims  aged 18 to 34 sought victim services, while those aged 35 
and older sought services at 7%.
•	 Younger victims of  property crime , aged 18 to 34, were more likely to seek victim services; 
22% of them reported that they sought services from an organization at least once, compared 
with 3% of property crime victims aged 35 and above.
•	 Identity crime  victims under age 45 were more likely to seek victim services, at a rate of 19%, 
than those age 45 and over, at a rate of 7%.

Race/Ethnicity 
The survey asked respondents to select the one category which best describes their race from the following 
categories: 
•	 American Indian
•	 Asian
•	 Bi-racial or multi-racial
•	 Black and/or African American
•	 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
•	 White/Caucasian
•	 Other (respondent could write in another category)
Respondents were asked in a separate question whether they were Hispanic/Latino. Due to the small 
number of minority races and ethnicities represented in Maine, those who chose a race other than White 
and those who chose Hispanic/Latino were combined into one group for analysis. For ease of reference, 
this group is referred to as “persons of color” throughout this report.
Crime Disparity
Persons of color were more likely to be the victim of every type of crime except identity crimes, as follows:33 
•	 Overall , persons of color were more likely than non-Hispanic White persons to experience at least 
one type of victimization, at a rate of 51% compared with 33%.
•	 Persons of color were more likely to have experienced rape  over their lifetime, at 36%, than non-
Hispanic White persons, at 22%. 
•	 Persons of color were twice as likely to have experienced stalking (31%) than non-Hispanic White 
persons (15%).
•	 Persons of color also reported a higher rate of property crime  (20%) compared with non-Hispanic 
White respondents (8%).
•	 Persons of color were nearly three times as likely to be threatened with violence than their non-
Hispanic White counterparts (19% compared with 6%).
•	 Persons of color were more likely to have been the victim of a hate crime , at 17%, compared with 
non-Hispanic White persons, at 6%.

Reporting to Law Enforcement
Victims of color were more likely to report crimes against them in general and more likely to report property 
crimes and identity crimes in particular: 34 
•	 Victims of color were more likely to report  any crime  to law enforcement, at a rate of 59%, 
compared with a rate of 29% for non-Hispanic White victims. 
•	 Victims of color were more likely to report  property crime  to law enforcement, with a rate of 
86%, compared with 50% of victims who were non-Hispanic White.

For most types of crime, victims of color and White victims sought services for those crimes at similar rates. 
An exception occurs, however, for threats of violence:35 
•	 Non-Hispanic White victims of threatening crimes  sought victim services at a rate of 25%; this 
is in sharp contrast to victims of color, none of whom (0%) sought victim services following 
crimes of threatening.

Household Income
Respondents were asked to indicate their total household income from all sources, and could choose from 
one of the following categories: 
•	 Less than $25,000
•	 $25,000 to $49,999
•	 $50,000 to $74,999
•	 $75,000 to $99,999
•	 $100,000 or more
Crime Disparity 
While those with higher household incomes were more likely to be the victim of identity crimes, those with 
lower household incomes were more likely to be the victim of most other crimes:39
•	 Respondents with household incomes of less than $75,000 were more likely to experience rape/
attempted rape  in their lifetimes, at 28%, compared with those with lower incomes, at 17%.
•	 Respondents with lower household incomes (less than $50,000) were more likely to experience 
stalking , at 22%, while those with a higher household incomes ($50,000 or more), were less likely 
to experience stalking, at 13%.
•	 Identity crimes , on the other hand, were experienced at a higher rate by those with higher 
household incomes. A total of 20% of respondents with household incomes of $75,000 or more 
were the victim of an identity crime compared with 14% of respondents with household incomes 
under $75,000.
•	 Respondents with household incomes of under $25,000 were more likely to experience domestic 
violence , at 14%, compared with those with higher incomes, at 4%.
•	 Those with household incomes under $50,000 were more likely to suspect or believe they were 
targeted for their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity. One out of every ten victims 
(10%) with lower incomes suspected or believed they were the victim of a hate crime , compared 
with 4% of those with higher incomes.
•	 In addition, those with lower household incomes (less than $75,000) were  threatened  with 
violence at a higher rate (10%) than those with higher incomes (4%).
•	 While few respondents indicated that they were victims of  violent crime , a disproportionate 
number of them came from households with lower incomes. Approximately 8% of those with 
household incomes of less than $50,000 experienced a violent crime, compared with 4% of those 
with higher incomes.
•	 Respondents with household incomes of under $25,000 were more likely to have been a victim of 
trafficking  in their lifetime, at 6%, than those with higher incomes, at 3%.

Victims with lower levels of household income were more likely to seek victim services for crime in general 
as well as for threats of violence and stalking in particular:40 
•	 Overall , victims in lower household income brackets (less than $50,000) were twice as likely, at 
a rate of 18%, to seek services as those in higher brackets, at 9%. 
•	 Threatened  victims with a lower household income, under $50,000, sought victim services at 
a rate of 26%, compared with 10% of threatened victims with household incomes at or above 
$50,000. 
•	 Victims of  stalking  with household incomes of less than $25,000 were more likely to seek

Location
Zip codes reported by respondents were broadly categorized as urban/suburban or rural using RUCA 
classification (see Methodology). Zip codes were also mapped to their respective counties.
Crime Disparity
Respondents from urban/suburban areas were more likely to experience two serious types of crime:41,42
 Urban/suburban respondents experienced domestic violence more frequently than their rural
counterparts, at rates of 7% and 4%, respectively.
 Urban/suburban respondents had a higher rate of violent crimes (7%) compared with ruralrespondents (2%).
Crime rates also varied by county:
 Cumberland43
o Cumberland respondents were less likely, at 1%, than those from all other counties, at 6%, to  
experience violent crime.
o Cumberland respondents were less likely, at 3%, than those from all other counties, at 7%, to  
experience hate crimes.
o Cumberland respondents were more likely, at 12%, than those from all other counties, at 8%,  
to experience property crime.
 Kennebec44
o Kennebec respondents were more likely, at 15%, than those from all other counties, at 6%, to  
experience domestic violence.
 Penobscot45
o Penobscot respondents were more likely, at 10%, than those from all other counties, at 5%, to  
experience domestic violence.
o Penobscot respondents were more likely, at 13%, than those from all other counties, at 4%, to  
experience violent crime.
o Penobscot respondents were more likely, at 12%, than those from all other counties, at 7%, to  
experience threatening.
o Penobscot respondents were more likely, at 12%, than those from all other counties, at 6%, to  
experience hate crime.
 York46
o Respondents from York were less likely than respondents from other counties to experience 
domestic violence; in fact, fewer than 1% of York respondents reported experiencing 
domestic violence, while 6 % of respondents from all counties did so.
41 These findings held true even aft  er controlling for age, income, and race/ethnicity.

Victims from urban and rural areas reported crime to law enforcement at similar rates. Victims of identity 
crimes from two counties, however, reported those crimes at rates different from other counties:47
•	 The overall rate of reporting to law enforcement for all counties was 21%. Victims of identity 
crime in Penobscot County, however, were less likely to report the crime to law enforcement, 
at 3%, and victims of identity crime in Kennebec County were more likely to report the identity 
crime, at 46%. 
Seeking Victim Services
Urban victims of crime were more likely to seek victim services for crime in general as well as for property 
crime in particular:48 
•	 Overall , victims living in an urban/suburban area were more likely to reach out to organizations 
than victims in small town/rural areas, with rates of 16% and 6%, respectively.
•	 Nearly one in seven (17%) urban/suburban  property crime  victims reached out to a victim 
services organization, while none of the rural property crime victims did so (0%). Figure 14

Relationship Status
The survey asked respondents “What is your marital status?”  and provided the following list of responses, 
with instructions to select one:
•	 Single, never married
•	 Married
•	 Divorced
•	 Widowed
•	 Separated
•	 Unmarried, cohabitating
Responses from this list were condensed into two categories: partnered (married or unmarried, 
cohabitating) and unpartnered ( single, divorced, widowed, or separated ). 
Crime Disparity
There were differences between partnered and unpartnered respondents for a number of crime rates, 
and in most instances, unpartnered respondents reported higher rates of victimization than those with 
partners.49 It bears mentioning, however, that relationship status is correlated with both household income 
and age. Older respondents tend to have higher household incomes than younger respondents, and they 
are more likely to be partnered. The correlation between relationship status and three types of crimes—
property, identity, and hate crimes—disappears after controlling for income and age.
•	 Unpartnered respondents were more likely to experience a rape/attempted rape in their 
lifetime, at 30%, compared with those who are partnered, at 19%.
•	 Unpartnered respondents were more likely to be the victims of stalking,  at 22%, compared 
with partnered respondents, at 13%.
•	 Unpartnered respondents were less likely than their partnered counterparts to be the victims 
of identity crime  (13% vs. 19%).
•	 At 12%, unpartnered respondents experienced domestic violence  at a higher rate than 
partnered respondents, at 2%. 
•	 Unpartnered respondents were also more likely to be the victims of property crime , at 12%, 
compared with partnered respondents, at 7%.
•	 Unpartnered respondents were more likely to experience  threats  of violence than their 
partnered counterparts (at 11% and 5%, respectively).

Reporting to Law Enforcement
Unpartnered victims were more likely to report crimes to law enforcement:50 
•	 Overall , about 39% of unpartnered victims reported the crime to law enforcement, compared 
with 28% of partnered victims.
Seeking Victim Services
Unpartnered victims were more likely to seek victim services for crime in general, as well as for any threats 
of violence and stalking in particular:51 
•	 Overall , unpartnered victims of crime had a higher rate (17%) of seeking victim services than 
victims who were partnered (10%). 
•	 Unpartnered victims of threatening were more likely, at 28%, to seek victim services than 
partnered victims of threatening , at 7%.
•	 Unpartnered victims of stalking contacted service organizations at a higher rate (16%) than 
partnered victims of  stalking  (5%).

Serving Maine  
Crime Victims
38This chapter presents data from Maine victim service 
providers, crime victims, and community leaders and provides 
insights into vital components of victim service delivery and 
accessibility, outreach efforts and awareness, and if victims’ 
needs are being met in Maine. It is the hope of researchers that 
these findings will be used to inform the future distribution of 
grant funds in a way that responds to the needs of crime victims 
and service providers.
CHAPTER 2  • 39
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Methodology
The Institute research team utilized a multi-phase approach for survey recruitment and data collection 
in order to build on the initial analysis of data shared by participants. For instance, responses from the 
Victim Service Provider Survey (VSPS) were used to identify areas of inquiry for interviewing and focus 
groups. Some VSPS respondents also assisted with recruitment efforts for interviews, focus groups, and 
participation in the Victim Needs Questionnaire (VNQ). OCFS leaders also made suggestions for interviews 
and focus groups based on their conversations with colleagues in the field.
All survey instruments and the larger research protocol were submitted to and received approval from the 
University of Southern Maine’s Institutional Review Board prior to engaging subjects in the research. The 
Catherine Cutler Institute’s Survey Research Center used Qualtrics, a web-based survey software, to deploy 
the VSPS and VNQ surveys. Data was downloaded from Qualtrics and analyzed with SPSS Statistics (Version 
27) software. Interviews and focus group findings were transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes and 
trends using NVivo 12 Pro software.
Victim Service Provider Survey
The Victim Service Provider Survey (See full survey in Appendix B) was designed to collect information from 
agencies across Maine that provide services to victims of crime and to identify service needs and/or gaps. 
The Institute research team obtained a list of Maine victim service providers that OCFS contracts with or 
maintains and then supplemented the list with known victim service providers working statewide.
VSPS Implementation
In September 2021, potential respondents received an introductory email announcement explaining 
the survey. Five days later another email with a link to the survey was sent to 79 victim service providers. 
From late September to mid-October, non-respondents received 2-3 email reminders and 1-2 phone call 
reminders, roughly a week apart, along with the survey link. On October 17, 2021, the survey was closed.
The final list included 79 agencies that work predominantly with victims who have experienced violent 
crimes, like domestic violence and sexual assault. There was a far more limited perspective for victims of 
other crime types, such as property crimes, financial crimes, and identity theft. Sixty-three (80%) of the 79 
Maine victim service provider agencies submitted survey responses and were included in the final VSPS 
analysis. There was representation from across Maine’s counties and prosecutorial districts, as well as from 
different types of victim services provided.
CHAPTER 2  • 40
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Victim Needs Questionnaire
While the VSPS gathered information from agencies that serve crime victims, the VNQ (See full survey in Appendix 
C) was designed to gather information directly from crime victims that sought services in Maine in the past 
12-months. The survey requested information about:
•	 crime(s) for which services were sought, 
•	 types of services received, 
•	 whether victims had unmet needs, 
•	 if victims experienced any barriers in obtaining services, 
•	 their experiences and opinions about reporting crime to state agencies and the police, and
•	 basic demographic information.
Recognizing that participation in the survey may cause victims to become distressed by recalling a traumatic 
event, the survey began with a detailed consent form that included links to Maine’s statewide helplines. 
Respondents who agreed to participate clicked a button and proceeded with the survey which was available in 
six languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Somali. OCFS leaders had directed the research 
team to include a broad perspective of crime victims and, therefore, the survey was made available in languages 
commonly used in Maine.52
VNQ Implementation
In January and February of 2022, the Institute research team worked 
with OCFS and Maine VOCA-funded victim service providers to 
promote the survey and generated a list of 60+ community-based 
organizations that would be asked to help passively promote the 
survey. These organizations were sent emails in February detailing 
the larger needs assessment efforts, along with a request asking 
them to promote the survey on their social media accounts, mailing 
lists, and/or by sharing the link directly with clients.53 VOCA-funded 
victim service providers and community organizations promoted the 
VNQ throughout February and into March.  Table 4. Organization 
Type  provides a broad categorization of the participating 41 
community-based organizations by their primary function or service 
population. The survey was closed in mid-March. A total of 129 VNQ 
responses were submitted of which 75 were included in the final 
analysis.54 Given the deployment method, it was not possible to 
calculate the response rate since there is no way to determine how 
many victims were notified about the survey.Organization Type Total n = 41

52 For quality assurance, the translated surveys were reviewed by local Mainers who are native speakers of each language.
53 Collaborating with community-based organizations enabled crime survivors to be reached without asking providers to divulge their contact information which 
maintained respondent anonymity. Because outreach came from providers that crime victims were already familiar with, this approach may have helped mitigate the 
risk of re-traumatizing participants with questions about their past.
54 After evaluating the responses, 28 were excluded from the final analysis because they were blank. An additional 26 were also excluded because the respondents 
indicated they were neither a primary or secondary victim of crime, and only completed the demographic section of the survey.
CHAPTER 2  • 41
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Key Informant Interviews and Focus Groups
Key informant interviews and focus groups were utilized for this needs assessment to gain a more in-depth 
understanding of the quantitative data and to gain a more detailed perspective of the strengths, promising 
practices, and unmet needs of crime victims in Maine. Zoom was used to conduct these semi-structured 
interviews and focus groups and sessions were scheduled for 60 minutes. Sessions began with a verbal 
consent statement informing participants of their rights and asked for their permission to be recorded for 
notetaking and transcription purposes. In some circumstances, the interview questions (See Appendix D 
for the list of interview questions) were slightly modified based on subjects’ interaction with VOCA funding 
and/or victim services provided.
Key Informant Interviews
Key informant interview participants were selected in consultation with OCFS leaders, utilizing convenience 
samples of justice system and community stakeholders, and invited to participate. Recruitment was based 
on factors such as response to the VSPS, type of victim services provided, and categories of population-
specific crime victims served. Eight key informant interviews were conducted between November 2021 
and February 2022 with a total of 13 individuals. Some interviews included more than one participant to 
represent an organization’s perspective and included victim service provider perspectives from across the 
state.55
Focus Groups
Based on information shared in the interviews and initial findings from the VSPS, additional topics and 
questions were developed to further explore in focus groups (See Appendix E for the list of focus group 
questions). Focus group participants were recruited, with help from other victim service providers, and 
three focus groups were conducted in February 2022 with a total of 26 participants. 
•	 Focus group 1 : Nine Victim Witness Advocates  from six prosecutorial districts and two state 
agencies (Department of Corrections and Office of the Maine Attorney General).
•	 Focus group 2 : Nine frontline victim service providers that offer culturally specific advocacy for 
victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. 
•	 Focus group 3 : Community leaders who provide and represent culturally specific programming 
across Maine not specific to crime victims.56
55 Organizations with staff that participated in key informant interviews included: Wabanaki Women’s Coalition; Immigrant Resource Center of 
Maine; Legal Services for the Elderly; Office of the Maine Attorney General; Maine Sheriffs’ Association; Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault; 
and Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence.
56 These organizations are all led by people of color and focus their services on addressing the needs in a manner that affirms the recipient’s 
culture. Represented organizations include: the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine, New England Arab American Organization, Her Safety 
Net, Cross Cultural Community Services, AK Health and Social Services, and Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition.

Limitations
This study is an attempt to assess the needs of crime victims statewide and utilized a variety of data 
collection methods in order to gain in-depth understanding of the key issues affecting victim services in 
Maine. However, there are limitations that exist due to constraints of the project.
Victim Service Provider Survey 
The list of victim service providers that was generated by the research team and OCFS leaders was by no 
means an exhaustive list of providers in Maine. As mentioned, the list of contacts was mainly of agency-
based victim service providers that OCFS contracts with and government-based Victim Witness Advocates. 
There were also some victim service providers that do not currently receive VOCA funds. The agency-based 
victim service providers represented in the survey work predominantly with victims who have experienced 
domestic and sexual violence which are categorized as violent crimes. The list did not include many 
victim service providers that help people who have been victims of other types of crimes, such as property 
crimes, financial crimes, identity theft, etc. Maine DHHS also has hundreds of OCFS child protective and 
adult protective caseworkers that some may consider being victim service providers; however, they were 
not included in this study due to constraints on time and resources. Finally, the VSPS included just two 
respondents that identify as working for a “culturally specific organization” and only one response from a 
victim service provider serving a Tribal government or other Tribal organization.
Additionally, due to a relatively small sample size, researchers were limited to descriptive statistics of the 
VSPS data. The research team was unable to conduct analyses to look for statistically significant differences 
in how responses varied between counties, prosecutorial districts, or types of agencies that responded 
to the survey. There are also limits to the survey responses for “Victim Demographics” data. Respondents 
provided their best estimates of the number of victims served by their agency in the past 12 months. 
These estimates could include duplicated counts of the number of victims served, as one victim may seek 
services from multiple agencies. Lastly, demographic data was not collected from all victims served. One-
third of survey respondents chose “unknown/unspecified” for the race demographic. MCEDV provided 
demographic data of victims served between 10/1/20 – 9/30/21 and nearly 53% of victims served did not 
have a race specified. Data provided by MECASA from the same time frame indicated the victims’ race was 
“unknown/unspecified” in 33% of victims served.
Victims Needs Questionnaire
The VNQ was promoted using a passive recruitment strategy and is, therefore, not a randomized sample of 
crime victims in Maine. The findings are limited and likely skewed toward victims of violent crime working 
with victim services organizations that focus on issues of domestic and sexual violence. Due to a small 
sample size, researchers were limited to descriptive statistics of the VNQ data and did not conduct analyses 
on statistically significant differences between groups of crime survivors.
CHAPTER 2  • 43
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Focus Groups and Key Informant Interviewing
There were limitations and time constraints on how many individual interviews and focus groups were 
possible. Participants were selected based on input from OCFS leaders, key stakeholders, and victim 
service providers. This method of convenience sampling makes use of information currently available 
about more mainstream services. As new community-based services emerge across Maine, it is likely that 
smaller and lesser-known victim service providers were overlooked. There are also providers that offer 
a broader array of services, geared toward more population-specific programming, that include victim 
services and advocacy in their overall programming. One area of victimization that should be explored 
further is the experiences and perspective of crime victims who are LGBTQ, as some of the highest rates of 
victimization affect these communities. The National Crime Victimization Survey reported that individuals 
who are sexual and gender minorities in the U.S. are 2.7 times more likely to be victims of violence crimes 
as compared to their cisgender, heterosexual counterparts.57 There are increasing services available in 
Maine, including MaineTransNet, that would be key stakeholders for future inquiry.
Victim Service Provider Survey Findings
The Victim Service Provider Survey (VSPS) final analysis included 
63 survey responses submitted by victim service providers across 
Maine. Due to the low number of survey responses collected, 
researchers generated descriptive statistics but were unable to 
conduct analyses to identify statistically significant differences in 
how responses varied between counties, DA Districts, or type of 
agency.
Provider Type
Of the 63 respondents, 59% of the respondents work at a state 
agency, 24% work at a victim services organization, 6% work at 
a legal aid/assistance program, and 3% work at an organization 
with a culturally specific focus. Each of the following places of 
employment had one respondent representing their perspective in 
the data: a mental health treatment program, a police department, 
a support services agency for formerly incarcerated persons, a 
tribal government or other tribal organization, and a victim services 
coalition (sexual assault).Agency TypeTotal

Two-thirds (68%) of the 37 respondents who indicated 
working at a state agency further specified that they work at a 
district attorney’s or prosecutor’s office. Smaller proportions 
work for the Department of Corrections and the Office of the 
Attorney General (8% and 11%, respectively). Eight of the 
15 respondents who indicated working at a victim services 
organization further specified that they work at a domestic 
violence (DV) services organization, and 5 specified that they 
work at a sexual assault (SA) services organization.
Service Area
In an effort to look at victim service provider responses by area served, researchers recategorized each 
survey respondent into one of three categories: providers that serve victims statewide, community-based 
domestic violence (DV)/sexual assault (SA) victim advocate service providers, and prosecutorial district 
Victim Witness Advocatess (VWAs). 
Respondents were asked which counties/regions their agency serves and were allowed to check as many 
as applied. At least one response was gathered from each of Maine’s sixteen counties. Nearly one-quarter of 
respondents indicated that their agency serves the entire state of Maine.Provider Type (n=63)  Total  Respondents

CHAPTER 2  • 45
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Training
VOCA allows limited funding for victim service providers to acquire essential skills and knowledge to 
respond to and assist crime victims. A series of questions about training was included in the VSPS to help 
gauge the knowledge base and training practices for victim service providers statewide.
Training for New Hires
Respondents were asked to indicate how many hours of victim 
services training are required for new hires. More than half (56%) 
of respondents indicated that victim services training is required 
for new employees. The percentage was greatest among DV/SA 
providers though these numbers are small. More than half of the 
Victim Witness Advocates (VWAs) indicated that there is no formal 
training or number of hours required for VWAs. That said, many 
VWAs reported that had received several hours of training when 
they were first hired.
Annual Training
In addition to asking about training for new hires, the survey also 
asked respondents about annual victim service training/education 
requirements. Just over half (54%) reported that some annual 
professional education/training is required. Most of these respondents (55%) estimated that the number of 
training hours ranged from six to twenty hours annually. Over one-third (34%) of respondents indicated  “no 
formal requirement. ”  There are no notable differences across the three categories of respondents.
It is worth noting that training requirements vary across agencies. Types of grant funding, employee 
position, caseload specialization, and other variables not captured in this survey all influence the types of 
required training.
Training Topics
Respondents were presented with a series of topic areas and asked 
whether they had received training on them as well as whether they 
needed additional training. Training topics most frequently reported 
as received were information about the justice system  and services for 
victims of crimes , while training topics most frequently reported as 
needed were  organization and program management  and services and 
outreach strategies for culturally specific and underserved populations.No formal

Respondents were then presented with a series of subtopics related to services for victims of crimes  and 
asked what training they received and/or needed. Two-thirds (67%) of respondents indicated that they had 
received training on victim compensation and more than half (55%) reported they had received training on 
the impact of crime on victims/survivors . Over one-third stated they needed forensic evidence collection and 
trauma assessment  (38% and 35%, respectively).

In addition, respondents were presented with a series of subtopics related to strategies for self-care 
and asked what training they received and/or needed. The subtopics that respondents most frequently 
reported as needing were effective conflict prevention and resolution techniques  and strategies for resolving 
ethical conflicts , at 42% each. Respondents were also asked what training they needed in terms of 
organization and program management . The subtopic selected most frequently was strategic planning 
(38%).
Training Challenges
Respondents were asked to indicate the challenges faced by their organization when considering training 
opportunities. Respondents were allowed to check off as many challenges as applied to them; therefore, 
percentages do not add up to 100%. Around two-thirds of respondents indicated that concerns about 
spending time away from other work needs  (66%), concerns about being short-staffed for other work needs 
(65%), and  lack of funding  (63%) were challenges faced by their organization when considering training 
opportunities.

CHAPTER 2 • 48
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Victims Served
Respondents were asked to estimate the number of victims their agency served in the last 12 months. Eighty-two 
percent (82%) of survey respondents answered this question. Two of the agencies who did not—Maine Coalition 
to End Domestic Violence and Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault—instead provided Cutler researchers with 
more in-depth data on the victims they served. Their numbers are reported separately (pp. 49-50).
Primary Victims
Respondents were asked to estimate the number of 
primary victims served by their agency in the last 12 
months. Of the 51 respondents who answered this 
question, the plurality (27%) estimated serving 251 to 
500 primary victims over the last year.
Secondary Victims
Respondents were also asked to estimate the 
number of family members, friends, or other types of 
secondary victims or non-victims served in the last 
12 months. Of the 45 respondents who answered this 
question, the plurality (38%) estimated servicing 101 
to 250 secondary victims over the last year.
Victim Demographics
Survey respondents were asked to provide the demographic breakdown of victims  served by their agency over 
the last 12 months.58 Note that the estimate of victims  served by each agency is not an unduplicated count; 
one victim might seek services from multiple agencies for various services, meaning that multiple responding agencies may have served the same victim.
Nearly two-thirds (62%) of the respondents reported serving Black/African Americans, and an additional 
proportion reported serving victims from two or more races (25%) and other races (17%). Only 56% served both 
Whites and Hispanics. The lower proportion of providers serving White victims may be counterintuitive, but it is 
due to the presence of culturally specific providers among survey respondents. In theory at least, victims of color seek services from any provider, but White victims do not seek services from culturally specific service providers; 
thus, White victims are served by fewer providers.
It is noteworthy that one-third of respondents reported servicing victims with unknown/unspecified race, which 
indicates that racial demographics are often not collected.Victims Served% Respondents

Demographic data about these primary victims were also 
provided; however, nearly 53% of the victim served race was 
not specified. Females accounted for 89% of the victims 
served within the MCEDV network; males made up 8%; and 
the remainder were transgender, non-binary, other or not 
specified. People between the ages of 25 and 59 accounted for 
nearly two-thirds (64%) of the victims. Additional demographic 
information is provided in Table 10. Other Demographics.
Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault Victims
The Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MECASA) submitted 
victim data for victims served through member sites across 
Maine from October of 2020 through September of 2021. As MCEDV did, MECASA submitted not estimates 
but actual counts gathered by querying their management information system—EmpowerDB.Other Demographics

Demographic data about the victims MECASA served was also provided, but the numbers provided were 
for both primary and secondary victims combined. In more than half (57%) of the victims served, the 
person’s race was White. The unknown  race category accounted for an additional 33% of all victims served. 
Females accounted for two-thirds (67%) of the victim served by MECASA coalition partners; males made 
up 18% of the victim served; and the remainder were non-binary, transgender or gender not listed. People 
between the ages of 25 and 65 accounted for 41% of the MECASA contacts during that 12-month period.
60 There is currently no standardized data collection method required for victim service providers. Some victim service providers utilize a secure 
case management software to collect data on total victims served by their organization while others employ other approaches.

Services Provided
Respondents were asked to indicate which VOCA-funded services their organization provides. Criminal/civil 
justice system assistance and information and referral services  were provided by the largest proportions of 
providers; at 87% and 84%, respectively. Follow-up questions were asked for each of the five services listed.
Respondents were then presented with a series of subservices related to criminal/civic justice system 
assistance and asked which subservices their organization provides. More than two-thirds (69%) reported 
providing criminal advocacy/accompaniment , and nearly two-thirds reported providing victim impact 
statement assistance  (61%) and assistance with restitution  (60%). Only one in five (21%) provide  civil legal 
assistance with family law issues , and even fewer provide other legal assistance and/or counsel (15%) or 
immigration assistance (10%).21%69%69%84%87%

Respondents were asked to indicate which subservices related to information and referral were provided by 
their organization. Response rates for four of the five services were fairly uniform, at 76% to 82%. The only 
information and referral service not provided by most respondents was information about the tribal justice 
system process , at 11%.
Respondents were presented with a series of subservices related to emotional support and safety services 
and asked which subservices their organization provides. Forty percent (40%) reported providing crisis 
intervention  (40%), followed by emergency financial assistance  (31%), and support groups (29%). It is 
noteworthy that none of the 12 subservices listed achieved a response rate of 50% or higher. The services 
that received the least support were other therapy  (11%), individual counseling  (6%), and s ubstance abuse 
services (5%).
Respondents were asked to indicate which subservices related to personal advocacy  and accompaniment  
services were provided by their organization. Forty-eight percent (48%) reported providing  law enforcement 
interview advocacy/accompaniment  (48%), followed by child advocacy  (34%), and individual advocacy  
(32%). Again, it is noteworthy that none of the 13 subservices achieved a response of 50% or higher. The 
services that received the least support were immigration assistance  (10%), o n-scene coordinated response  
(8%), and performance of medical or nonmedical forensic exam or interviews (5%). Most of the respondents 
do not provide shelter/housing service , and fewer than one in five respondents offer the subservices of 
relocation assistance, transitional housing , and emergency shelter or safe house services .Figure 2611%76%81%81%82%

Lastly, respondents were presented with a list of seven other services and asked to select those provided 
by their organizations. Sixty percent reported providing assistance in filing compensation claims , 34% 
reported prevention and education , 26% reported supporting survivors finding justice outside the criminal/
civil system , 23% reported batterers intervention programming , and 10% reported culturally and or ethically 
specific services . None of the organizations reported providing  supervised child visitation assistance  (0%).
Barriers to Service
The survey presented respondents with a list of barriers related to victims’ language or culture, geographic 
location, organization finances/staffing, organization training/education, and a miscellaneous category. 
Respondents were then asked to report how frequently they observed victims experiencing each barrier 
when trying to access services at their organization over the last 12 months using the choices never, rarely, 
sometimes, usually, and always . For ease of reference, this report counts 
responses of sometimes, often , and  always  as the presence of a barrier.
When asked about barriers related to language or culture , half (51%) 
of respondents indicated that they saw a lack of culturally accessible 
services  as a barrier to providing victim services during the last twelve 
months. Nearly half (45%) of respondents indicated that they saw a 
lack of language accessible services  as a barrier, while one-third (34%) 
of respondents indicated seeing a lack of accessible services for persons 
with disabilities . Note: No one identified any of these barriers as always  
being experienced by victims.Half (51%) of respondents 
sometimes or often saw a lack 
of culturally accessible services 
as a barrier to providing victim 
services during the last twelve 
months.

When asked about barriers related to geographic location , almost 
nine in ten (89%) providers saw a  lack of transportation for victims to 
access services  as a barrier to providing victim services during the last 
twelve months.  Lack of knowledge regarding other available services 
within the catchment area  was identified by over three-quarters (82%) 
of respondents as being a barrier, while over two-thirds (71%) of 
respondents indicated that  lack of other services available within the 
catchment area  was a barrier.
Providers were asked how often over the last 12 months they encountered barriers related to finances and 
staffing while providing services. Nearly nine in ten (89%) respondents indicated that a lack of funding to 
pay for needed staffing  was a barrier. A l ack of flexible funding to meet survivors’ practical needs  was seen 
as a barrier by more than three-quarters (85%) of respondents, while three-quarters (79%) of respondents 
indicated a lack of staff to meet demand for services was a barrier. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents 
indicated that they saw a lack of applicants for vacant staff positions  as a barrier, and about the same 
proportion of providers (62%) saw poor staff retention  as a barrier.Nine out of ten providers (89%) 
sometimes, often, or always saw

When asked about barriers related to training and education , over half of respondents (59%) noted 
seeing a lack of knowledge regarding the needs of victims of certain crimes  as a barrier to providing victim 
services during the last twelve months. More than half (54%) of respondents indicated that they saw a  
lack of training and educational opportunities for staff and volunteers  as a barrier, and less than half (46%) 
indicated that they saw a lack of in-house policies and procedures to guide organizational practices  as a 
barrier.
Respondents were presented with six additional barriers and asked how often over the last 12 months 
they observed them while providing services for victims. As shown in Figure 30. Additional Barriers 
Experienced  below, a quarter or more of respondents indicated seeing program reached capacity/
lack of other capacity  (28%),  lack of services designed for victims of certain crimes  (28%), lack of general

Staffing Challenges
Respondents were asked to indicate which types of positions are difficult to fill at their agency. They were 
instructed to check off as many positions as applied; therefore, percentages do not add up to 100%. About 
one-quarter of survey respondents indicated that advocates and support staff  positions are difficult to fill 
(26% and 24%, respectively). No respondent reported difficulty filling healthcare staff  positions.

Assessment of Services
The survey presented respondents with a list of services that they reported providing in a previous question 
and asked them to select the five services they think their organization does best. Next, respondents were 
presented with the same list and asked to select the top five services they think their organization could 
improve. Lastly, they were presented with the list again and asked to select the top five services they think 
could be improved across Maine.
Services Victim Service Providers Do Best
The service organizations listed as doing best most often was information about the criminal justice 
process  (47%), or nearly half of respondents. This response was mentioned more often among the Victim 
Witness Advocates who made up nearly half of all respondents. Rounding out the top six, were information 
about victim rights/ how to obtain notifications  (40%), notification of criminal justice events  (37%), criminal 
advocacy/accompaniment  (31%), prosecution interview advocacy/accompaniment  (24%), and victim impact 
statement assistance  (24%).

Services Victim Service Providers Could Improve
As depicted in Figure 32. Top 6 Services Done Best & Needing Improvement , the top six services that 
organizations believe they could improve were headlined by referral to other services, supports, and 
resources (27%). This response was mentioned more often among the advocates. Rounding out the top six, 
were  law enforcement interview advocacy/accompaniment  (21%), assistance with restitution  (19%), referrals 
to other victim services programs  (19%), supporting survivors finding justice outside the criminal/civil system  
(16%), and  criminal advocacy/accompaniment  (15%).
Services Maine Could Improve
As shown in Figure 32. Top 6 Services Done Best & Needing Improvement , the service mentioned most 
often as needing improvement in Maine was referral to other services, supports, and resources (35%). 
Rounding out the top six, were referrals to other victim services programs  (29%),  assistance with restitution  
(26%), information about victim rights, how to obtain notifications, etc.  (24%), information about the criminal 
justice process  (21%), and  law enforcement interview advocacy/accompaniment  (18%).
The responses to “Services Maine Could Improve” were similar to “Services VSPs Could Improve.” On top 
of both lists was referral to other services, supports, and resources . In addition, three other services - law 
enforcement interview advocacy/accompaniment, assistance with restitution, and referrals to other victim 
services programs  – appeared on both lists, though the order was a little different.
Assessment of Services to Specific Populations
The survey presented a list of 20 population groups and asked respondents to select those they felt their 
organization served well and to check those for whom services could be improved. They were instructed to 
choose one option, both options, or neither option as they deemed appropriate.
The majority of respondents reported serving most populations well (15 out of 20). The populations most 
frequently reported as being served well were people who are pregnan t (80% of respondents reported 
serving them well), those who live in rural communities  (82%), students  (77%), those with low-income or 
living in poverty  (76%), those over 65 years of age  (71%), and those aged 13 to 17  (71%).
On the other hand, the majority of respondents also reported needing to improve services for most 
populations (16 out of 20). The populations most frequently reported those for whom services should 
be improved were those with limited English proficiency  (79% of respondents reported the need for 
improvement), immigrants, asylum seekers, refugees, and/or new Mainers  (77%), members of Tribal 
communities  (68%), D/deaf or hard-of-hearing populations or those with speech/vision impairments  (67%), 
members of island communities  (67%), and racial or ethnic minorities  (66%).

Victim Needs Questionnaire Findings
A total of 101 individuals completed the online Victim Needs Questionnaire. While survey respondents 
could identify as primary victims, secondary victims, or both, 26 of the 101 individuals who completed the 
VNQ did not identify as any type of victim.61 Since the survey was intended to reflect the responses of crime 
victims in Maine, these cases were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the following findings are based on 
the responses of 75 individuals who reported experiencing and seeking services for one or more crimes.
Additionally, it is important to note that while 40 individuals solely identified as primary victims and 9 
solely identified as secondary victims, 26 respondents identified as both. Therefore, the duplicated count 
includes 66 primary victims and 35 secondary victims. Individuals who identified as both a primary and 
secondary victim are included in each group when these findings are presented separately by victimization 
type but are otherwise presented once (de-duplicated).
The survey was available in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Somali, and Spanish. The majority of 
participants completed the survey in English (96%, n=72), while one respondent completed it in French 
(1%) and two completed it in Portuguese (3%). No participants completed the survey in French, Spanish, or 
Somali.
Demographic Traits
Table 12. VNQ Demographics displays the demographic traits of VNQ respondents (n=75). While most 
respondents provided responses to every demographic question, some did not. Additionally, some original 
survey categories were collapsed for data analysis and presentation purposes. Most respondents were 
female (89%), straight (75%), between 25-44 years old (63%), White (81%), had a medical or health-related 
disability (60%), and were primary victims (88%).
61 The Office of Victims of Crime  has provided the follow definitions: A primary victim is the individual who suffered direct harm as a result of 
the crime and a secondary victim is an individual who experienced an indirect consequence of the crime. Secondary victims may include 
relatives of the primary victims or individuals who witnessed the crime.

Types of Crime
Respondents were asked what types of crimes—personal or property—led them to seek and/or accept 
services. Those who reported being both primary and secondary victims were asked this question for 
each type of victimization. Also, respondents who experienced both types of crime reported both. Thus, it 
is possible for one individual to be represented in all four result categories. Both primary and secondary 
victims were more likely to have sought services for personal crimes rather than crimes impacting their 
property (including financial crimes). Ninety-four percent (94%) of primary victims and 82% of secondary 
victims sought services for personal crimes, and 27% of primary victims and 23% of property victims 
sought services for property crimes and financial crimes.
Figure 34
The majority of primary victims (79%) who experienced a personal crime experienced intimate partner 
domestic violence . Smaller proportions of primary victims experienced sexual assault (37%), stalking (32%), 
rape  (31%), non-intimate partner domestic violence  (27%), and assault  (26%). The most frequently reported 
personal crime type reported by secondary victims was non-intimate partner domestic violence  (50%), 
followed by intimate partner domestic violence  (46%), violence perpetrated by a stranger (32%), sexual 
assault (32%),  stalking, and assault  (29% each).94%

Hate Crimes
Respondents were asked if they believed they were targeted for victimization because of their race, color, 
religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability, or sexual orientation. A third of primary 
victims believed they were, and another quarter were unsure; thus, a total of 58% of primary victims 
believed or suspected they were victims of a hate crime. About a quarter of secondary victims (26%) 
believed the primary victim associated with their secondary victimization was targeted due to hate, and 
another 17% were unsure; thus, a total of 43% of secondary victims believed or suspected the primary 
crime was motivated by hate.79%

Crime Reporting
Respondents were asked whether they reported 
the crimes that led them to seek services to either 
an agency, such as the Department of Health and 
Human Services, or to law enforcement. The majority 
of primary and secondary victims reported to law 
enforcement, at 63% and 64%, respectively. Less 
than half of primary victims reported the crime to an 
agency, but 70% of secondary victims did so. (Note: 
Victims of property crimes were asked this question as 
well, but there were too few responses to analyze.)
Victims Informed of Rights
The survey asked respondents whether they had been informed of their 
rights. The majority of primary victims who reported the crime to either 
an agency or law enforcement were informed of their rights, at 63%, while 
only 44% of secondary victims said that the primary victims of the crimes 
associated with their victimization had been informed. In a couple of 
instances in which the secondary victim said the primary victim had not 
been notified, the primary victim was no longer alive as a result of the crime.“As a victim, the biggest problem I 
faced and still face in any legal or 
other situation is NO ONE believes 
me. ”

Those who reported crimes to either an agency or law enforcement 
were asked how satisfied they were with the response of that agency 
or law enforcement personnel. Because victims could be both primary 
and secondary victims and they could have experienced more than 
one type of crime, this question was asked separately of primary and 
secondary victims and separately for property and personal crimes. Seventy-one percent of primary 
victims who reported a personal 
crime to a state agency were 
unsatisfied with the response 
they received.Not

Three of the resulting four combinations had too few responses to analyze accurately, but a substantial 
number of primary victims stated that they had reported personal crimes to either a state agency or law 
enforcement, and the majority of these victims said they were somewhat unsatisfied or very unsatisfied  with 
the responses of both of these entities. Seventy-one percent (71%, n=24) of primary victims who reported 
a personal crime to a state agency were unsatisfied with the response they received, and 53% (n=36) of 
primary victims who reported a personal crime to law enforcement were unsatisfied.
Service Sought and Received
Survey respondents were asked what types of services they sought during the past twelve months as a 
result of the crimes they experienced as well as what types of services they received. Respondents could 
select multiple services. The services most frequently sought by respondents were counseling services 
(67%), advocacy services  (63%), and legal services  (36%). These were also the services that respondents 
most frequently reported receiving. Seventy-three percent (73%) of respondents reported receiving 
counseling , 56% reported receiving advocacy services , and 27% reported receiving  legal services . This aligns 
with the responses to open-ended questions, which identified mental health counseling/therapy, support 
groups, free legal services, and court advocates as the most frequently needed services.

Satisfaction with Services
Primary and secondary victims of crime were asked to rate their satisfaction with the services they 
received using five categories— very unsatisfied, somewhat unsatisfied, neutral, somewhat satisfied, and 
very satisfied . Because point estimates cannot be calculated reliably for sample sizes smaller than 20, 
only two types of services will be reported here, namely  advocacy services  and counseling . The majority 
of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the counseling and  advocacy services  they received, at 
65% and 54%, respectively.
Learning of Services
Respondents were asked how they knew or learned about the organizations they contacted for services 
and were instructed to select as many choices as applied. More than a third of respondents (39%) reported 
doing their own Internet searches to find services. Another 29% reported that another victim service agency 
had referred them, and a quarter (25%) said that law enforcement or someone from the criminal justice 
system told them.Figure 41

Availability of Services
Service location is often identified as a barrier to accessing 
services. To gauge how service location impacted service provision, 
respondents were asked if they were able to obtain the services they 
wanted in the town/city in which they live and whether they were 
able to obtain them in the county in which they live.
 About a third of respondents (33%) were able to get all the services they wanted in their town/city, a little 
more than a third (35%) were able to get some of the services in their town/city, and a little less than a third 
(32%) said they were not able to get any of the services in their town/city. Almost half of respondents (47%) 
were able to get all the services they wanted in their county, meaning more than half (53%) were only able 
to get some or none of the services they wanted in their county.About half (47%) of respondents 
were able to get all the services 
they sought in their county.
Figure 43Availability of Services
Mode of Service Delivery
Respondents were asked how they received services— in person, online, and/or over the phone . They were 
instructed to select as many modes as applied. Responses were almost evenly split among the three 
options, with 60% of respondents reporting over the phone  and online and 56% reporting in person.

When service satisfaction was cross tabulated with how the service was received (in person only, only 
remotely, or both in person and remotely), no trend was present that indicated that the service modality 
impacted satisfaction with service provision.
Barriers to Seeking Services
Barriers by Experience or Situation
Respondents were asked to identify the barriers they experienced while seeking or accepting services. 
These barriers presented fell into five categories— barriers related to language or culture, geographic 
location, finances/insurance, personal privacy or residency status,  and additional barriers . A little under a 
quarter of respondents (23%) reported experiencing barriers related to language and culture . Because 
very few respondents completed the survey in a language other than English, this finding is likely an 
underestimate of the true proportion of victims who experience this barrier. Thirty-nine percent (39%) 
reported experiencing barriers related to their geographic location . A majority, 56%, reported experiencing 
barriers related to finances or insurance (56%) and personal/residential status  (72%). A majority also 
reported experiencing additional barriers  (72%).

COVID-19 Pandemic
In addition to the aforementioned barriers, respondents were asked 
to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their ability to access 
a variety of services. The survey provided five categorical responses: 
much easier to access services, somewhat easier, neutral, somewhat 
harder , and much harder to access services . Some services were 
accessed by too few respondents to analyze accurately, but across 
each of the remaining services, the majority of respondents reported 
that the pandemic made it harder or much harder to access services . Seventy-one percent (71%) reported 
this of legal services , 65% reported it of medical services 56% reported it of  counseling , and 53% reported it 
of advocacy .The majority of respondents 
reported that the pandemic

Additional Context for Barriers to Service
The survey included several open-ended questions inviting victims to provide additional feedback about 
their experiences seeking or accessing services, and some respondents shared more details about the 
barriers they encountered in their responses to them. Long waitlists, staff turnover, and not enough 
available services  were some of the major themes that emerged when analyzing these data. One 
respondent noted, “I tried for MONTHS to get help accessing affordable legal assistance divorcing my 
abusive husband. This is just now starting to happen (7 months later). ” Another shared, “I honestly believe the 
State falls extremely short in timely and appropriate advocacy. ”
CHAPTER 2  • 72
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Some respondents spoke to how the  pandemic directly impacted the increase in time to receive 
services. However, a few shared that these were issues prior to the pandemic and that the pandemic 
should not be used as an excuse to address these issues. One respondent wrote, “I’m extremely tired of 
Covid being an excuse. Covid is here to stay, and the legal system, courts, etc., need to be more adaptive and 
accommodating to the victims. ”
Respondents detailed in an open-ended question some instances of 
dissatisfaction with their experiences seeking and receiving services. 
One theme that emerged from these responses was distrust  in 
authorities , sometimes stemming from having experienced a negative 
interaction as a victim like not being believed when advocating for 
themselves, a friend, or a family member. A few open-ended responses 
spoke to a deep-seated mistrust in DHHS as an institution.
Other respondents wrote about  victim service staff, DHHS staff, and police officers lacking the proper 
training  to handle the case and that this and policies contribute to victims experiencing further harm. One 
respondent shared, “There needs to be change as to how DHHS handles child rape cases. In my situation 
they forced me to continue to live with my abuser which resulted in more trauma. ”
Victims also expressed dissatisfaction with how court system 
professionals engaged with them and stated that  court system 
professionals need increased training . One respondent wrote, “This 
nightmare is just an annoyance to the court and every department we’ve 
been in contact with, ” while another shared that they received, “very 
poor treatment by the county judicial service. ” Another victim stated, 
“There needs to be more legal counsel and judges that truly understand 
and recognize DV. ”  
Improving Access to Services
The survey gave respondents an opportunity to say if there were any specific types of services they wished 
were easier to access and whether there were things that would make accessing existing services easier. 
These were open-ended questions, and the themes that emerged were the desire for greater access to 
support groups, therapy or counseling services, legal services, housing, childcare, and counseling or 
support services for children.
A number of respondents were mothers who experienced domestic and/or sexual violence and wanted 
services to support them in leaving the abuser and keeping their child(ren) safe. As one of these 
respondents explained,  “The system does not support women leaving their offender. I am dealing with it 
now. The courts allow visitation. There are no services for middle-class women to financially be able to leave 
an offender. ”  A secondary victim explained that the primary victim “stayed two years longer than she should 
have because she couldn’t find a place to live that she could afford on her own. ”“Police always refer to the abuse as a 
disagreement or a fight. ” 
 - VNQ respondent
“There needs to be more advocacy 
around domestic partner rape and 
assault—it’s hard to find support for 
that or people who understand the 
weight it has. ”  
- VNQ respondent
CHAPTER 2  • 73
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Other responses were related to the ways in which a person’s 
financial situation and/or the larger economy impacted their ease 
of accessing services. Affordable housing, childcare, and legal 
services were all described as financial hurdles respondents 
faced both in daily life and when accessing services. Respondents 
said that free services, a stipend to help pay for services, and services 
being offered on a sliding scale would make accessing existing 
services easier. Still for some, the largest issue was that they were 
unable to access services because of where they live, what they can 
afford, or because services did not exist in their community. One 
respondent shared, “Services need to be available in order to be 
accessed. ” 
A lack of providers, both locally or virtually, was also noted, with some respondents sharing that they 
have been or were currently on waitlists for services for many months, sometimes for more than a 
year. Some respondents mentioned creative ways to make services more available, especially during 
the pandemic, including the use of social media to hold support groups and more telehealth services. 
Finally, respondents mentioned  the need for more providers overall as well as providers who have 
specialized training, are multilingual, or offer more flexible hours, such as nights and weekends.“Living in a major city, I’m fortunate 
that access to services doesn’t 
seem to be an issue geographically; 
however, there are financial 
hurdles to getting needed services, 
particularly counseling for myself and 
children. ”

Key Informant Interview and Focus Group Findings
Participant Information
Qualitative research methods were used to gain a more in-depth understanding of the strengths, 
promising practices, and unmet needs of crime victims in Maine. A total of 39 participants from a variety 
of backgrounds engaged in eight interviews and three focus groups to share their perspectives on the 
provision of victim services in Maine.
These interviews were guided by a standard set of questions and qualitative data analysis revealed 
overarching themes and sub-themes. There were notable success stories and examples of how some of 
the efforts made have been paying off so far. However, it was also clear that there are some challenges 
and gaps in some victim service providers’ ability to provide essential, core victim services, related to low 
advocate pay and additional staffing issues.
Despite the existence of more BIPOC-led, culturally specific programming in Maine, there are major 
concerns about the unmet needs of victims of violent crime from Maine’s most marginalized communities, 
including Mainers who are people of color and/or connected to Maine’s immigrant and refugee 
communities. Tribal communities, especially, have faced numerous challenges providing services for crime 
victims.

CHAPTER 2  • 75
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Themes that Highlight Current Strengths and Promising Practices 
VOCA Investments in Civil Legal Services Have Been Successful
Victim service providers noted that efforts to provide civil legal services to crime victims in Maine have 
been successful. VOCA-funded investments in civil legal services statewide, provided by Legal 
Services for the Elderly and Pine Tree Legal Assistance, continue to help meet the tremendous 
needs of victims of elder abuse and other vulnerable crime victims  facing critical issues related to 
housing, public benefits, consumer debt issues, healthcare, and education protections, including those 
under Title IX. These successes are due to prioritization in previous VOCA funding cycles; however, the 
needs continue to exceed current funding and available resources.
Consolidation of Contracts Led to Improvements in Maine’s 
Response to Domestic Violence
Another success that was highlighted was a previous 
DHHS decision to consolidate the much smaller contracts 
held by each domestic violence resource center so that 
MCEDV is now a pass-through entity for all the local 
centers. The interview with MCEDV staff identified how  this 
reconfiguration succeeded in strengthening the response 
to domestic violence work statewide, including data 
collection, ongoing collaboration, and streamlining the 
administration of funding . MCEDV administers other victim 
assistance funding ( Family Violence Prevention and Services 
Act, Social Services Block Grant, Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families Block Grant, VOCA, VOCA Administration, 
Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program, and state funds) , 
although it was noted that the VOCA Administration funds 
provided to MCEDV to administer contracts were not sufficient 
and MCEDV attained additional state funds, so the additional 
fiscal resources were provided only “due to the additional state 
funds we were successful in advocating for from the legislature. ”  
Victim Witness Advocates Fulfill a Crucial Role in Ensuring Crime Victims’ Rights
VWAs are reaching victims but face logistical challenges.
Prosecution-based Victim Witness Advocates (VWAs) are an important part of the criminal justice 
process and are sometimes the only resource available to victims of crimes , other than victim 
services related to domestic and sexual violence. However, VWAs voiced concerns about meeting the 
needs of crime victims. Currently, Maine’s prosecution-based VWA positions are primarily funded with “… There are some marvelous people 
doing victim witness work in many of 
the DA’s offices and there are others 
who are just so burnt out that they 
are doing harm to victims because 
they are just frustrated that victims 
are not making it easier for the 
criminal justice system. And so that’s 
problematic, and I think that part of, 
and if you want to deal with burnout, 
what you know you need is more 
capacity, better supervision, more 
breaks, better training, and ongoing 
kinds of continuing education. And 
there’s been no training for the 
Victim/Witness Advocates since the 
VOCA funding ended for the Victim 
Assistance Academy. ” 
– Victim service provider
CHAPTER 2  • 76
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
county budgets and there are many geographic disparities across the state. Each of Maine’s prosecutorial 
districts, which vary in size from one to four counties, receives about $55,000 of VOCA funding a year.  
This flat amount is not enough to cover a full-time VWA’s salary and fringe rate, and the prosecutorial 
districts differ widely in how much additional funding is available for staffing these positions. Victim 
Witness Advocates reported the strains on their time and the logistical difficulties of providing full 
coverage for accompaniments at multiple courthouses, especially in the state’s largest geographic 
regions, as well as responding to all crime victim needs with limited staffing. VWAs identified some areas 
in data collection, program reporting, and financial reimbursement that could be streamlined through a 
consolidated contract for VOCA funding across prosecutorial districts.
VWA position constraints and pressures mean disparate access to assistance for victims of crime.
Victim Witness Advocates continue to prioritize victims’ rights as outlined by statute, despite enormous 
pressures and limitations of their positions. VWAs described the efforts they go to so that victims are 
informed of their rights, provided information about the criminal justice process, accompanied to court 
in criminal cases, and notified of criminal justice-related events (case status, arrest, release, etc.). One 
VWA shared the positive changes she has seen over the years and how,  
“It’s successful when a victim gets to speak in the courtroom, and regardless of what 
everybody else wants to see happen, the judge actually hears and considers the victim 
and how it’s going to affect the victim’s life and sometimes sides with the victim. And it’s 
very empowering when that when that happens for victims…I’ve seen the progress of this 
over the years. I mean when I first started years and years ago, victims didn’t even speak at 
sentencing and now judges ask about it at hearings, you know for victims, they want to hear 
how they feel. ” 
However, VWAs and other victim service providers raised concerns about the pressures on these 
positions and disparities across the state, by region, and by category of crime victimization, with 
inconsistent victim notification practices and even some lapses. One participant spoke to this when they 
shared “…so their victim rights were not being sufficiently honored and part of the problem is because the 
district attorneys’ offices have such minimal victims’ services capacity. ” 
Office of the Attorney General’s VWA Coordination position is a valuable resource.
A final promising practice within the work of VWAs was highlighted in multiple interviews and that 
was to acknowledge and appreciate the benefits of the relatively new VWA coordination position 
housed in the Office of the Attorney General.  This position was praised as a valuable resource for 
VWAs statewide, as it has provided a consistent source of technical assistance, training, mentorship, and 
continued support for this challenging work. 
CHAPTER 2 • 77
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
There is a Timely Opportunity and Broad support for a VOCA- Funded 
Victim Notification Automated System
A final statewide issue that was raised in multiple interviews may already have a possible solution that could be 
implemented with VOCA resources. Stakeholders across 
interviews mentioned an issue with victims being notified in a timely manner when a perpetrator is released from county 
incarceration. One stakeholder described the experience 
of one crime victim who had their home broken into and 
the offender had been incarcerated, however, there was no 
notification when the offender was released. The next day the 
offender showed up at the victim’s place of employment. The 
significance of this experience was described as “it’s really 
quite devastating…and it’s a problem in the state of Maine. It’s very real.”
Interviews also revealed that Maine has a timely opportunity to come together under the leadership 
of the Maine Sheriffs’ Association and their initial efforts to develop a VOCA-funded victim 
notification automated system. Any new system would need to have automated technology combined 
with human components, however, there was notable interest in convening a cross-section of 
stakeholders to work together to provide oversight and manage security concerns. The overall 
benefits would include victims of violent crime having the option of supplementing their communication 
from VWAs with timely and accurate notifications, as statutorily required by Maine law Title 17-A, Chapter 
75: VICTIMS’ RIGHTS. 
Themes that Identify Significant Challenges and Gaps
Significant Investments in Competitive Staff Pay, Supervision of Direct Services Staff, and Administrative Infrastructure are Required for the Provision of Quality Victim Services
Core victim services for crime victims are negatively impacted by chronic staff ing issues, particularly 
among sexual assault advocate victim service providers and Victim Witness Advocates. Low pay, ongoing 
staff turnover, unmet supervision needs, and overhead costs to administer funding negatively impact 
the quality of services and the ability to reach all crime victims.  
victim services, especially for victims beyond those served by mainstream domestic and sexual 
violence programming, victims of all crimes will continue to have their needs unmet, especially 
those from marginalized communities. “Release notification is a huge 
issue…and Maine is right now the only state in the country that does not 
provide an automated notification 
system. ”
- Victim service provider
 Without strengthening foundational 
CHAPTER 2  • 78
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Victim service providers noted again and again that when mainstream organizations experience routine 
stressors of staffing basic services, they are unlikely to provide enhanced services, such as culturally 
specific and/or population-specific programming. It was noted that different regions will always have 
different needs, and so one victim services advocate that specializes in culturally and community-
specific work advised the best solution would be to “Put the money in core and sustainability and then 
have each community assess and reprioritize their marginalized populations, while still everyone does 
marginalized population work. ” 
“Grinding Poverty” in Maine Often Perpetuates Ongoing Hardships and Unmet Needs of Crime Victims
Compounding factors of poverty cannot be ignored.
The economic struggles of Mainers and the impact of “grinding poverty” cannot be overstated and many 
needs are consistently not met. Victim service providers shared that “one of the realities is that both the 
people committing crimes and the victims of crimes in Maine disproportionately represent people who are 
poor”  and there are continuing concerns about basic housing, transportation, and broadband that 
undercut all crime victimization needs.  One victim service provider shared the perspective that there 
are many crime victims “hovering on the margin and need a lot of help just to stay afloat. ” 
The impact of substance use disorder and property-related crimes, financial exploitation by a loved one, 
and/or other violent and non-violent crimes perpetuates ongoing hardships that are “coming from a 
poverty lens”  as opposed to a crime victim lens. One advocate explained how this means  “You can’t really 
stereotype property crime victims and say like “well it’s less serious” because it can really depend on the 
person, it can really feel like quite an invasion...with a person who doesn’t have a lot of resources. ”
Issues with restitution exist statewide.
Remedies such as restitution and civil legal assistance with matters of economic stability were identified 
as areas in need of more attention. The ongoing problems with restitution in Maine were shared across 
multiple interviews and focus groups, and it was noted how even a modest recovery could mean 
“the difference of somebody being able to pay their property taxes or pay for their prescription drugs or 
continue to meet their needs if they’ve otherwise lost their life savings. ” 
VWAs described their challenges in helping crime victims with restitution , including both assistance 
in requesting and then again when collection efforts are not successful.  “We don’t recover because there’s 
nothing to recover”  was shared as an ongoing problem and it was also stressed that crime victims often 
require additional help outside the criminal justice system, and yet that help is often non-existent in 
Maine. While resources exist for victims of violent crime, especially survivors of domestic and sexual 
violence, many other crime victims’ needs are neglected.  Stakeholders did mention innovations in 
other states that have established state funds to address inadequacies, like the insufficiencies of the 
current system for restitution in Maine.
CHAPTER 2  • 79
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Culturally Specific Programming is Under-Resourced Despite Providing More Comprehensive Services
Culturally specific organizations provide comprehensive services, yet report being under-funded and 
under-resourced.
Participant interviews and focus groups consistently highlighted the more substantial, comprehensive 
services provided by qualified advocates from culturally specific programming. As Maine’s population 
demographics change, more and more specialized and culturally relevant programming is being 
developed to meet emerging needs above and beyond crime victim services.  Culturally specific 
advocates typically provide more than the basic crime victim services and are often “embedded in 
the communities we serve”  and can serve as a “surrogate family”  for crime victims who are also facing 
additional challenges and unmet needs. However, this preferred approach is typically under-resourced 
and often not utilized or even recognized by mainstream systems and organizations. 
Multiple stakeholders acknowledged that funding 
distribution favors mainstream domestic 
and sexual violence victim service providers 
and does not meet the needs of the most 
marginalized communities  that are more likely to 
be victimized. Others noted there is not adequate 
resource sharing with culturally specific programs 
and yet mainstream systems and organizations 
are not equipped to serve these specialized crime 
victimization needs. 
Culturally competent programming requires 
more in-depth understanding in order to provide 
adequate programming and/or referrals and 
services. While mainstream organizations utilize 
over the phone and in-person interpreter services to speak with crime victims, there is a need for 
recognition of and additional funding for more comprehensive culturally specific programming to better 
serve crime victims.
There is opportunity for new collaborations within established training, funding, and resourcing.
Culturally specific services providers noted the strong foundation of the established mainstream 
trainings and services and how culturally specific programming could be strengthened if 
partnered with the right resources. Focus group participants described the benefits of partnering 
with mainstream programming, as opposed to operating in “silos.” The model of service delivery for 
population-specific programming such as LGBTQ, older adults, and/or culturally specific immigrant 
and refugee programming aspires “not to create more burden for the victim…it is already burdensome...
if those services are not accessible because of a cultural barrier, a language barrier, then it’s an added 
burden. ”“…we work in a very white system, and this 
system is led by white women and women who 
have a lot of privilege, …the reality is people 
we serve will never interact with systems, they’ll 
never be able to advocate on their behalf. Those 
voices - they’re just not there…they’re invisible. 
And so this white women led movement hasn’t 
found the space and the time to integrate other 
cultures and other realities. ”
–Culturally specific victim service provider
CHAPTER 2  • 80
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Stakeholders acknowledged that while there has 
been recognition that, “the best way to provide 
services to many of the marginalized populations is 
through, for, and by”  there are not enough resources 
to do so, despite the best intentions. One culturally 
specific victim service provider recalled, “They 
said… ’We know your cultural specific programs and 
wanted to do this and that’ but when it comes to 
resources and enabling us to do our services in way 
of staffing and capacity building and training and 
the tools, it hasn’t happened. And, we can’t say that 
openly, because it jeopardizes the relationship we have. ”
Victim service providers across all organizations interviewed revealed an openness to change and to 
have more collaboration to meet these unmet needs. For example, one victim service provider shared, 
“Folks want to support a whole survivor to connect with marginalized populations to work 
on our own services to ensure that they are not prescriptive…so we’re talking about funding 
the people who are already in trusted and close relationships with historically marginalized 
populations, partnering them, funding them, funding the centers to work with them and 
have clear sort of expectations for each other. ”
Current VOCA Allocation Implementation and Evaluation is Not Designed to Address the Highest Needs 
in a Way that Incorporates Stakeholder Input and Transparency
Maine’s VOCA funds have historically been distributed 
in a way that some programs are not invited to 
participate in the process while others have not 
ever had to apply.  It was observed that “most of the 
investment right now is going into domestic and sexual 
violence. ” Furthermore, there was acknowledgement 
from those currently receiving VOCA funding that “VOCA 
fund distribution should include informed perspectives 
from the broader scope of crime victim serving entities 
and be a transparent process…it is currently managed 
internally at DHHS without any broader input or 
participation, which is a carryover from when the 
amount of funds coming to Maine were so small, and the 
distribution a much simpler question. ”“A lot of best practice tools can be acquired 
and then replicated through the lens of the 
communities that we serve. It can be tailored so, 
for instance, the 40-hour advocate training for 
sexual assault and domestic violence infuses our 
identities and our needs into that training. ” 
–Culturally specific victim service provider
“One thing I really want to highlight is the buck 
stops with the state of Maine… We know we are 
a protected class. We know we are underserved 
populations. And what that means is all the 
resources that come to the state of Maine, you’ve 
got to set aside for this population. The set asides 
don’t come to us. A lot of times it goes to the 
courts. It goes to mainstream organizations. And 
the way they do this is by providing language 
access because someone came through their 
doors that meets that check box. ”
–Culturally specific victim service provider
CHAPTER 2  • 81
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Relatedly, it was observed that Maine’s current grant structure seems to be operating within  a system 
that continues to fund the same mainstream organizations to determine how resources are spent.  
One victim service provider explained, “…particularly because there are a lot of gaps that need to be filled 
and that no one’s attentive to, and so, you know, the power players keep getting what they want, more or 
less, and these other needs don’t get met. ” It was further noted that mainstream organizations often 
lack capacity and expertise, and so underserved populations are routinely not served or served 
inadequately. Therefore, funding decisions and distribution of grant awards have favored these “power 
players” to the detriment of marginalized communities in Maine.
There was consensus between mainstream 
and culturally specific victim service provider 
leaders that there is an opportunity to bring 
more perspectives to the table and rebuild 
together , “We need to do different kinds of work 
that is integrated and broad and not be held to 
the same kind of work, same kind of standard, 
and the same kind of scope, in order to be right 
with the funders. ” There was also a call for 
attention to critical programming needs, such as 
transportation, housing, childcare, food, medical 
care, etc. that do not fit within the structure of 
current grants. 
A leader of culturally specific programming 
weighed in on a focus group observation about 
funding that often goes directly to mainstream organizations,
“Why are you not believing in the pain of our community when we’re saying, culturally, we 
are being oppressed...Why do you choose not to listen? But you only choose to delegate. And 
it creates this narrative of “We can’t trust you. ” Now we have two combating forces that say, 
“I’m offended because you’re choosing not to trust me” and another combating force that 
says, “You have not proven that you are trustworthy. ” And we end up in this situation where 
the only people who lose out are the victims that we should be taking into consideration at 
all times for the bigger picture. So, we can sit here and talk about why we’re not receiving 
funding, but we need to sit here and talk about why do people not care that these victims in 
these BIPOC communities are being harmed at massive rates through cultural norms. ”“I’m going to say it out loud - it’s racism. That’s 
why we do not get the services that we need. 
It’s not only for healthcare, it’s for everything. 
It’s for housing, it is for employment. So now 
this organization is knowing the fact, knowing 
what the problems are, knowing what research 
shows, when you have people who are providing 
services to people that look like them, that sound 
like them, that speak like them, had the same 
religion, culture, everything. But you are saying, 
“No wait, I don’t want to do that. ” 
-Culturally specific program leader

Tribal Services and Programming Have Been Left Out of 
Maine’s VOCA-Funding Process
Maine’s distribution of VOCA funding lacks a provision for 
Tribal victims of crime.
Interviews revealed an omission from Maine’s current 
DHHS VOCA funding distribution and set-aside 
requirements for underserved crime victims’ services, 
and that was the  lack of provision of funding for victims 
of crimes in Tribal communities. Victim service provider 
advocates from the Wabanaki Women’s Coalition, 
described comprehensive, culturally specific programming 
for survivors of domestic and sexual violence that 
demonstrates best practices. However, there are 
continued gaps and unmet needs that could be filled 
with additional funding support from this VOCA 
funding stream.  A stakeholder familiar with the previous 
distribution of state and VOCA funding explained that 
“There is insufficient recognition of the importance of this 
government-to-government relationship, so the sort of 
true political trouble between the state of Maine and these 
Tribes has minimized to some degree the funds that these 
programs could access. ” 
A Tribal victim service provider of domestic and sexual 
violence services described having gone “many years 
without having a full team” despite higher rates of 
victimization in their communities, perpetrated mostly 
by white men, “I keep stats and between 85%-90% of my 
named abusers are white men. ”
Funding for comprehensive Tribal victim services, 
that range from 24/7 helpline, in-person advocacy, 
accompaniment, civil legal assistance, transitional housing, 
court accompaniment, civil legal assistance, etc., was only 
recently stabilized through the U.S. Congress authorization 
of the OVC Tribal Victim Services Set-Aside program 
that provides funds that support Tribal communities to 
enhance services for crime victims, consistent with VOCA.SPOTLIGHT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CUL TURALLY SPECIFIC TRIBAL VICTIM 
SERVICES:
When stressing the importance of 
culturally relevant specific services, an 
anecdote was shared in one interview 
about the StrongHearts Native Helpline , 
a culturally specific national helpline for 
Native Americans all across the country 
who are impacted by domestic, dating, 
and sexual violence. Before this national 
Native Helpline was able to be staffed 
24/7, calls that came in after hours were 
routed to the mainstream national 
domestic violence hotline. 
A Tribal victim service provider in 
Maine shared a statistic provided by 
the StrongHearts Native Helpline that 
indicated callers did not stay on the line 
to be served by the non-culturally specific 
program: In 2020, “Not one person stayed 
on the line for the national hotline. They 
dropped the call…So those who realized 
they were being routed would just hang 
up, ” emphasizing that these Native callers 
would rather go without victim services 
than be served by a non-culturally 
specific victim services program. 
It should be noted that Tribal victim 
services for domestic and sexual violence 
in Maine are provided 24/7 through the 
Wabanaki Women’s Coalition  and so are 
not routed to any other program.
CHAPTER 2  • 83
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Victim Service Providers in Tribal communities serve Tribal and non-Tribal members and are 
positioned well to be part of the Maine DHHS VOCA funding model.
However, there are still many more needs that could be met with more recognition of the unmet needs 
and allocated funding for services provided to Tribal communities in Maine . A victim service provider 
for Tribal communities also pointed out,  “Within our local area, we do serve non-Tribal members also 
and they don’t necessarily have to have a connection to the Tribe. I mean we do get phone calls from just 
local people in the area. But I do think it’s a strength that we are located in a Tribal community and have 
such strong ties to the community. We’re very well known by the people that call us, so oftentimes there’s 
actually already some sense of connection and trust. ”
Another Tribal victim service provider, in a separate interview, said, “Sometimes people think we only 
work with Natives and that’s not true. We work with whoever comes to us, and if we can’t fulfill their needs, 
we will do warm referrals to other agencies. ”  As with other population-specific and culturally specific 
programming, interviews revealed there is an opportunity for change in the current VOCA funding 
structure. Inviting Tribal leaders to be part of the Maine DHHS VOCA funding model , while also 
honoring the OVC Tribal Victim Services Set-Aside provision, would be  a first step towards repairing 
some of the damage caused by this historical harm and neglect.
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Chapter 3: 
Discussion
84This report presents a statewide and comprehensive victim 
needs assessment to inform DHHS administrators and other 
statewide leaders of the current needs of crime victims and 
recommendations for implementing improvements, including 
strategies in accordance with VOCA requirements. Maine and its 
victim service providers have achieved notable successes while 
serving crime victims. 
There are also areas in need of improvement and those changes 
should be guided by key findings related to:
1. Crime victims and characteristics of those most 
affected by crime;
2. Victim service providers and their insights into 
promising practices and gaps; and
3. The perspectives of crime victims who shared their 
firsthand accounts as service recipients.
VOCA rules require that a minimum of 10 percent of a 
state’s funds is allocated to programs that serve previously 
underserved populations of victims of violent crime. This 
assessment revealed concerns about the unmet needs of crime 
victims, especially those who are victims of violent crime and 
are from Maine’s most marginalized communities. People of 
color, who are often individuals connected to Maine’s immigrant 
and refugee communities or Tribal members, are more likely to 
experience almost every type of crime. While rates for reporting 
crime and seeking service are higher for these victims, victim 
service providers and stakeholders flagged gaps in the provision 
of culturally competent services. Victim service providers 
also noted that resources are not allocated adequately for 
improvements to be made under the current structure. Maine’s 
next steps must include engagement with leaders from 
Tribal, population-specific, and culturally specific programs 
to determine what victim services should be developed and 
constructed to best meet the needs of all crime victims.
CHAPTER 3  • 85
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Key Findings
Crime Victims 
1. Crime directly impacted one out of every three adults in the state of Maine in 2021.
Maine is considered the “safest” state, as measured by the FBI62 because it has the lowest reported violent 
crime rate and fourth-lowest property crime rate. That said, the 2022 Maine Crime Victimization Survey 
(MCVS), which includes crimes that go unreported, found that crime directly impacted 34% of adults in 
Maine. This is an estimated 372,000 people. MCVS respondents reported the highest victimization rates for 
stalking, identity theft, and property crime.
2. The majority of crimes in Maine go unreported, and the majority of victims did not seek assistance from 
Maine’s victim services organizations.
In 2021, the MCVS found that fewer than one in three victims reported the crime to law enforcement while 
only about one in eight sought some type of assistance from victim services. Victims who were the most 
likely to seek services from an organization were from the youngest age group (aged 18 to 34), in lower 
household income brackets (less than $50,000), female, and living in an urban/suburban area. While victims 
were not directly asked why they did not seek services after their victimization, the VSPS and VNQ revealed 
specific barriers to accessing services that inform this discussion. Specifically, geographic location/
transportation to services, a lack of knowledge about available services, personal privacy concerns, and 
cost of service and/or lack of insurance were identified as barriers that significantly impact service seeking.
3. Just over one-third of crime victims experienced two or more types of crime.
The majority (65%) of those who reported experiencing any crime reported just one type of crime 
(i.e., property crime, identity crime, etc.), but 19% of victims experienced two types of crime, and 16% 
experienced three or more types of crime over the past 12 months.
4. Persons of color were more likely to be the victim of any and every type of crime except identity crime, 
and this remained true even after controlling for differences in income.
While one out of every three non-Hispanic White people in Maine were victimized in the last 12 months, 
one out of every two persons of color were victimized. Persons of color were more likely to be the victim 
of any and every type of crime except identity crime, and this remained true even after controlling for 
differences in income. The differences in rates vary from one type of crime to another, but rates are 
most divergent when looking at violent crime. Persons of color were four times as likely as non-Hispanic 
Caucasians to be the victim of a violent crime in Maine last year. Additionally, hate crimes were experienced 
at the highest rate by persons of color, who had a rate of 17%, compared with non-Hispanic White persons, 
at 6%.

CHAPTER 3  • 86
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
5. Nearly one in five (18%) crime victims who reported having experienced any type of crime in 
the previous 12 months reported that at least one crime was committed by a current or former 
domestic partner or family member.
Those who experienced a crime committed by a current or former domestic partner or a family 
member experienced more types of crime (3.2 types) compared to other victims (1.2 types). The 
three types of crimes a victim of domestic violence was likely to experience were stalking, threats of 
violence, and violence (i.e., robbery, assault, sexual assault, and rape). More violence is inherent to 
this type of crime which can correspond to higher needs of victims, requiring victim service providers 
to provide more services to meet those needs.
6. Younger Mainers reported experiencing more victimization and are more likely to report crime to 
law enforcement. 
The demographic group most likely to experience crime was those aged 18 to 34, at 53% compared 
with 29% of those aged 35 or over. Younger victims, those between the ages of 18 and 34, were more 
likely to report crime to law enforcement than any other age cohort. Almost half (48%) of the younger 
group reported a crime to law enforcement, while those aged 35 and older had a reporting rate of 
25%. 
Service Providers
7. Victim service providers need more formal training opportunities, generally, and that specifically 
address services and outreach strategies for meeting the needs of diverse populations.
Just over half of victim service providers that completed the VSPS indicated their agencies have a 
formal training requirement for new staff and require ongoing annual training. Training that addresses 
services and outreach strategies for culturally specific and underserved populations are in most 
demand. Victim service providers also identified needing trauma assessment and forensic evidence 
collection training for victims of crime.
Focus groups and interviews found that MCEDV and MECASA are well established to support training 
efforts and there is an opportunity to partner with emerging population-specific and culturally specific 
programs for more specialized training and outreach efforts. Culturally specific providers recognize 
the strong foundation of Maine’s victim services and the advocate training provided by established 
mainstream programs and the advantages of partnering, as opposed to operating in “silos,” when 
meeting the needs of crime victims. A temporarily funded position within the Office of the Attorney 
General was noted as a valuable resource for VWAs statewide to receive consistent training, technical 
assistance, mentorship, and continued support.
CHAPTER 3 • 87 STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
8.  Victim service providers are routinely not serving or are 
inadequately serving Maine’s diverse populations.
Victim service providers readily identify that their agency 
needs to improve services for crime victims and, more broadly, Mainers that:
 are immigrants;
 have limited English proficiency;
 are Deaf/hard of hearing or those with speech/
vision impairments;
 live on island communities;
 are people who are members of Tribal 
communities;
 are people with physical/intellectual/cognitive 
disabilities; and
 people who belong to racial or ethnic 
minorities.
Tribal programs and other culturally specific and 
population-specific programs are serving Maine’s crime victims as part of their comprehensive programming, however, these resources are under-resourced and oft en overlooked by mainstream systems (Please see 
the Case Example  in the sidebar). Culturally competent 
programming requires more in-depth services than interpreter services, and there is a need for recognition and additional funding for more comprehensive culturally specific programming.
9.  VOCA-funded services provided most often are criminal/
civil justice assistance and information and referral services.
More than two-thirds of VSPS respondents provide criminal advocacy/accompaniment and nearly 
two-thirds provide victim impact statement assistance and assistance with restitution. However, only one in five providers off  er civil legal assistance with family law issues and fewer than one in five 
provide other legal assistance and/or counsel and immigration assistance. Only information about the tribal justice system process was identified as not being provided by most agencies.
Focus group and interview data found that VOCA-funded investments in civil legal services statewide SPOTLIGHT ON CUL TURALLY SPECIFIC 
ADVOCACY – A CASE EXAMPLE
An example was shared about a culturally 
specific advocate’s experience at a Maine hospital. When the advocate, who was dispatched from an agency that is a full member center of both MCEDV and MECASA, arrived, she was wearing a nametag that identified her as a victim services advocate. She recalled that she was met with skepticism,  “… the doctor 
and nurses look at me and they were like “who are you?” 
Both the advocate and the victim were 
from the same region and culture and spoke the same language and dialect. However, the hospital staff   informed the 
advocate, “We’re gonna have to have our 
own interpreter because we cannot use you” and brought in a male interpreter 
who spoke the same language but used a diff  erent dialect. The advocate 
described how, “my client starts feeling 
very uncomfortable and I could notice while they were treating her that she was not comfortable….and she was like “What is he saying? What is he trying to say?” And I always had to translate it again to the doctor, it was a mess. It was very uncomfortable. ”
CHAPTER 3  • 88
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Focus group and interview data found that VOCA-funded investments in civil legal services statewide 
have helped crime victims facing critical issues related to matters of economic stability, including 
housing, public benefits, consumer debt issues, healthcare, and education protections. However, 
additional resources are required to meet the high demand for civil legal services. In fact, the VNQ 
indicated that legal services (i.e., divorce, custody, or immigration assistance) were the third most 
sought type of service that crime victims wanted and tried to access. Legal services were also 
identified as a type of service in need of greater access, only surpassed by counseling services and 
support groups.
10. The lack of culturally accessible services, language-accessible services, and transportation for victims 
to access services are the most frequently cited barriers to service for Maine crime victims.
Half of VSPS respondents indicated that a lack of culturally accessible services is sometimes or is often 
a barrier to providing victim services. Mainstream organizations lack capacity and expertise to provide 
culturally specific victim services. While use of interpreters and translated materials are important, 
there is also a need to share resources and acknowledge the broader scope of victim serving entities.
More than two-thirds of VSPS respondents indicated that transportation for victims to access services 
was sometimes, often, or always a barrier to accessing services. This aligns with VNQ responses 
that showed two-thirds of respondents had to seek services outside of the town or city they live in 
either because they had no access to or only some access to needed services in their hometown. 
Furthermore, geographic barriers to service were identified by two in five VNQ respondents.
11. Core victim services for victims of crime are negatively affected by a lack of funding to pay for 
needed staffing, the inability to retain existing staff, and a lack of training opportunities for staff and 
volunteers.
The majority of VSPS respondents saw the lack of funding to pay for needed staffing as a service 
barrier, while three-quarters indicated they lacked enough staff to meet service demands. Likewise, 
crime victims that participated in the VNQ indicated that one of the largest barriers when accessing 
services was there not being enough services available to meet the demand. The result was long 
waitlists and critical needs going unmet. VSPS respondents shared that advocates and support staff 
are the hardest positions to fill. Also, over half of providers saw a lack of training and educational 
opportunities for staff as sometimes or often a barrier to providing victim services. Finally, VWAs and 
other victim service providers raised concerns about the pressures on VWA positions and challenges 
in providing consistent services, including victim notification, across the state due to limited capacity, 
inadequate supervision and support, and insufficient continuing education.
CHAPTER 3  • 89
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
Administration of VOCA Funds
12. DHHS methods for determining VOCA funding allocations are not adequately meeting the needs of 
all crime victims. 
The MCVS revealed that some types of crime typically affect a small percentage of a large segment 
of the population (Mainers who are older adults) while some very small segments of the population 
(Tribal members and BIPOC Mainers) are much more heavily victimized by multiple types of crime. 
Victim service providers and stakeholders described how current funding creates ongoing challenges 
to meet the needs of the many and the few. 
13. DHHS funding decisions and current VOCA allocation practices favor mainstream organizations to 
the detriment of diverse populations and emerging programs that offer more culturally relevant and 
population-specific services for crime victims.
Mainstream coalition leaders and culturally specific program leaders acknowledge a need for change 
to the funding structure and the opportunity to bring together more perspectives and in-depth 
knowledge of underserved populations. Half of victim service providers indicated they saw a lack 
of culturally accessible services as a barrier and interviews and focus groups indicated additional 
resources are needed to provide more culturally relevant services. One-third of VSPS respondents 
chose “unknown/unspecified” for the race demographic data so there are likely additional persons of 
color and other underserved populations that are not even represented in existing demographic data. 
Persons of color in Maine are four times as likely as non-Hispanic Whites to be a victim of a violent 
crime. More efforts are needed to address this disparity and increase access to services.
14. More resources are needed to support and expand essential victim services provided by victim 
service providers. Crime victims will continue to have their needs unmet, especially those from 
underserved communities, unless administrative infrastructure is strengthened to reduce staff 
turnover and other factors that affect the quality of victim services.  
VNQ data found that staff turnover and a lack of adequate staffing mean not enough available 
victim services and long waitlists for the services that are available. Providers engaged in this study 
consistently indicated that a lack of funding has contributed to limited victim services provided and 
received, and that funding levels have not allowed the growth of 
victim service opportunities. Stakeholders shared in interviews that 
noncompetitive salaries contribute to staff burnout and turnover 
that negatively impact victim services. Additional VOCA funding 
was identified as an opportunity to offer more competitive wages, 
benefits, supervision, training, and continuing education for staff. “I understand that many victim 
services are staffed largely by 
volunteers, but the rapid turnover 
of personnel results in victims 
depending on people with limited 
knowledge and experience in 
assisting victims. In my case, this 
greatly complicated (and delayed) 
my ability to receive the assistance I 
needed. ” - VNQ respondent
CHAPTER 3  • 90
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
15. Maine is the only state in the U.S. that does not have an option for victims of violent crime to 
participate in an automated notification system for updates on offender custody and criminal case 
status. Victim service providers noted some concerns about statewide consistency in timeliness and 
accuracy of current victim notification processes. 
Stakeholders from across victim services organizations and VWAs expressed interest in exploring an 
automated notification system to supplement current efforts and systems, but only if data protections 
and victim safety precautions are embedded within the automated system. The Maine Sheriff’s 
Association was identified as a current stakeholder with in-depth knowledge and capacity to lead a 
partnership, which would require substantial input and oversight by multidisciplinary stakeholders.
16. Restitution is a remedy in criminal law that directs a defendant to pay a victim a designated amount 
to compensate for losses. The poverty rate in Maine contributes to the failure of offenders to pay 
restitution, with many crime victims unable to recoup losses.
Ongoing issues with restitution in Maine were shared across interviews with Victim Witness Advocates, 
providers of civil legal assistance, and victim service providers. Repayment, in whole or in part, by the 
offender does not always occur. It was noted that many crime victims are “hovering on the margin” of 
poverty and even a modest recovery could make a big difference to help meet basic needs.
Recommendations
The following recommendations begin by offering specific guidance to Maine’s VOCA State Administering 
Agency, OCFS at DHHS, and concludes with broader recommendations for the state agencies, coalitions, 
and councils that oversee and collaborate around the federal, state, and local funding sources that address 
the needs of Maine crime victims.
1. Redesign the VOCA funding allocation process to ensure the distribution of funds 
to victim service organizations commensurate with the changing needs of victims 
receiving services from those organizations.
Reconsider the systematic process for VOCA funding allocations and convene a larger circle of input, 
with more intentional inclusion of BIPOC, culturally specific, and Tribal government leaders to be part 
of the planning, implementation, and ongoing process. Consider funding for victim service provided 
within broader population-specific services. Require more consistent tracking of demographic data 
so victims from underserved communities are more likely to be accurately identified and provided 
culturally competent and relevant services. Adhere to recent guidance and requirements from both 
the federal Department of Justice and the Maine Legislature to use funds to advance equity for 
marginalized and underserved communities and improve the status and outcomes for the historically 
disadvantaged racial, Indigenous, and tribal populations of Maine.
CHAPTER 3  • 91
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
2. Prioritize VOCA funding for increased 
support of core victim services and for 
regional, population, and culturally 
specific programs.
Prioritize VOCA funding for entities to strengthen 
administrative infrastructure and sustainability of 
core victim services. Encourage investments in victim 
service provider staffing and programming that 
creates additional capacity to provide high-quality 
victim services and build out partnerships with 
those service providers of population-specific and 
culturally specific programs that are already working 
with underserved crime victims.
Efforts related to improved administrative 
infrastructure, core victim services, and supporting 
regional, population, and culturally specific services 
and programming should keep the following areas 
in consideration when addressing changes and 
improvements: 
•	 Types of services available : victims’ needs 
vary due to physical, emotional, educational, 
and financial needs.
•	 Types of crimes reported and reporting 
rates : types of crimes vary by region, 
population, and by the likelihood of victims 
reporting.
•	 Accessibility of services : location, hours 
of operations, virtual or in-person, and ADA 
compliance all impact if services are both 
available and accessible to victims.
•	 Quality of services rendered : Providers 
should engage service users when 
determining service design and should 
regularly evaluate services by offering 
satisfaction surveys and other feedback 
tools.In 2022 the Department of Justice released 
its Equity Action Plan to advance equity for 
marginalized and underserved communities. 
The plan prioritizes: 
A. Leveraging federal funds provided by the 
Department to (a) encourage grantees to 
include equity considerations in the provision 
of federally funded services, (b) enhance 
data collection to identify and take action 
to address disparities in access to the 
Department’s programs or services based on 
demographic factors, and (c) better ensure 
that grantees are complying with non-
discrimination mandates;
B. Improving access to funding opportunities 
for organizations that are led by, or primarily 
serve, historically marginalized and 
underserved populations;
C. Reducing language barriers that make it 
difficult for individuals with limited English 
proficiency to access Department programs or 
activities, communicate public safety concerns, 
or vindicate their rights;
D. Improving the Department’s engagement with 
stakeholders in underserved communities 
and disadvantaged groups in order to 
establish enduring relationships with them 
and enhancing the public’s awareness of 
the Department’s expansive mission and 
resources.
In 2019, the Maine Legislature established the 
Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, 
Indigenous, and Maine Tribal Populations  as 
a non-partisan, independent entity with a 
mission to examine racial disparities across all 
systems and work at “improving the status and 
outcomes for the historically disadvantaged racial, 
Indigenous, and tribal populations of the State.” 
(Maine Title 5, Chapter 631).
According to this law, criminal justice initiatives, 
are to be managed so that financial and 
human resources are “allocated to eliminate 
the disparities caused by structural racism.” 
“Policies that are ‘race-neutral,’” the law says, “will 
ultimately maintain existing disparities.” 
CHAPTER 3  • 92
STATE OF MAINE VICTIM NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 2022
3. Establish a VOCA-funded statewide electronic notification system.
Consult with the Maine Sheriffs’ Association and review previous development efforts for a VOCA-
funded statewide electronic system for automated victim information and notification system. 
Convene a broad multidisciplinary group of stakeholders to advise and oversee a VOCA-funded 
design, implementation, and oversight of an automated victim notification system.
4. Fund a permanent Victim Witness Advocate Coordinator position to provide 
continued statewide support and coordination of Victim Witness Advocates. 
A temporarily funded Victim Witness Advocate Coordinator position that was created to provide 
support and coordination of VWAs statewide was highlighted as a valuable resource. Allocate VOCA 
or another consistent funding sourcefunding to support a permanent Victim Witness Advocate 
Coordinator located within the Criminal Division of the Office of the Maine Attorney General. Continue 
to utilize this position to improve outcomes for crime victims by providing VWAs with consistent 
training, technical assistance, mentorship, and support.
5. Explore options for generating additional funds to provide restitution to Maine 
crime victims.
Assemble a group of stakeholders, with input from the Office of the Maine Attorney General, to 
examine the issue of restitution in Maine. Review other states’ approaches, such as Vermont,63 and 
explore options for additional funds to be generated with state funds and/or other resources. 
6. Engage a diverse group of stakeholders to establish a new decision-making 
process based on statewide strategic planning that addresses coordination 
of overlapping funding (e.g., VOCA, STOP , FVSPA, etc.) and efforts to meet the 
ongoing and changing needs of crime victims. 
Maine receives numerous federal grants and allocates state funding designated for crime victim 
services, e.g., VOCA, STOP, FVPSA, etc. Crime victims will be better served by a new decision-making 
process that encourages collaboration to maximize the delivery of services and prioritizes unmet 
victim needs as a component of the funding allocation strategy. While many of the same leaders 
and “power players” are involved in all these grants, new efforts must include leaders from Maine’s 
marginalized communities that are disproportionately affected by crime and the aftermath of 
victimization. To ensure resources are distributed accordingly, the planning process should be 
convened by DHHS leaders and adhere to guidelines stated in the federal DOJ Equity Plan and the 
state’s Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous, and Maine Tribal populations 
requirements.

Questionnaire
116Introduction and Consent
Welcome! Thank you for volunteering to take part in this 
important survey to gather information about victim services 
in Maine! We are gathering anonymous information about 
the experiences of people who were victims or survivors of 
crime.  Before beginning this survey, please read the consent 
form on the next page and click ‘Yes’ to consent to the survey. 
Thank you in advance for your time.
Introduction: This survey asks questions about the harm(s) 
that led you to seek services during the past 12 months, the 
types of services you tried to get, the types of services you 
did get, and the barriers to accessing services in Maine. This 
information will help us learn more about what is working 
and what can be improved. We want to know if you got the 
resources and support you needed. Researchers at the 
Catherine Cutler Institute at the University of Southern Maine 
will be analyzing survey responses and writing a report with 
the anonymous findings for the Maine Office of Child Family 
Services (OCFS).  
    
What will I be asked to do?  You will be asked to answer 
questions about the types of harm you experienced as well 
as questions about the services you tried to access. Some 
questions in this survey ask for a single response, some will 
allow you to check off as many answers as you want, and 
some questions will ask you to answer in your own words. 
We expect this survey to take around 20 minutes to complete. 
It can be saved and completed in multiple sessions. You 
can skip any questions in the survey that you do not want to 
answer, and you can stop taking the survey at any time.

What do we mean when we say “crime” and “victim?”   The words “victim” and “crime” are 
used throughout this survey. By “crime,” we mean any of the harms listed below, regardless of 
whether the person who did the harm was officially accused of a crime. By “victim,” we mean that 
you have been harmed, whether the harm includes physical injury or not, and even if you did not 
report it. “Victim” sometimes means the harm happened directly to you, and sometimes it means 
the harm happened to someone you know, and it impacted you. (We refer to these as primary 
and secondary victimization.)

tried to, or threatened to )   
•	Assault (someone  injured victim with a weapon or with physical force )  
•	Domestic violence ( physical or emotional harm inflicted by a current or former intimate/
romantic/dating partner)

physical harm or mental anguish; to subject victim to unreasonable confinement; to take 
victim’s money, property, or assets without victim’s permission)    
•	Hate crime (physical/emotional harm inflicted due to the victim’s race, color, religion, sex, 
ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability, or sexual orientation)
