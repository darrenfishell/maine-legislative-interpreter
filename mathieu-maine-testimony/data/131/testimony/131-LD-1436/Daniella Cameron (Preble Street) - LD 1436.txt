Hello Chair Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the 
Judiciary Committee. My name is Daniella Camero n. I am the Deputy Director of 
Preble Street and founder of Preble Street’s Anti -Trafficking Services. I a m 
writin g to testify i n support  of LD14 36: An Act to Provide Remedies for Survivors 
of Commercial Sexual Exploitation.    
 
Preble Street strongly supports  legislation that mitigates the intense stigma and 
criminalization that survivors of commercial sexual exploitation  face an d 
strengthen s the suppor t these individuals are offered. Th e sealing  of criminal 
history record information relating to a  crimina l conviction of prostitutio n and the 
convening of a commercial sexual exploitation survivor and human 
trafficking  victim  assistanc e stakeholder grou p to make service recommendations is 
a strong step in the right direction .  
 
Many of the survivors we have served  over the years  were either incarcerated 
during inta ke, while receiving services and /or self -reported a history of 
incarceration.  Since  2020, mor e than hal f self-reported  that they were trafficked  
specifically  for criminal labo r, meaning their trafficker ma de money by forcing 
them to commit crimes,  includin g drug trafficking.  These survivors fac e painfu l 
and lastin g consequences within the criminal justice system for acts they were 
forced to comm it against their will.    
 
The National Survivor Network surveyed  130 survivo rs and found that 90% had 
been arrested at least once while being trafficked.  While the nature of the arrest and 
charges vary depending on the type of trafficking, minimal services are currently 
operating for  survivor s within the Maine Departme nt of Correction s. Upon release,  
survivors  face an increased risk  of being re-trafficke d due to many factors, 
includin g isolation from support systems, lack of housin g or secure employment, 
lack of protection of  previou s traffickers, and lack of mental hea lth services and 
healthcare .

Survivors of human trafficking and exploitation often face barriers to recovery and 
healing after exiting their trafficking situation because of criminal charges incurred 
during their trafficking experience.  The sealing of re cords recommended in 
LD143 6 protects survivors from facin g barriers to employmen t and housing, and  
experiencing the  stigma that comes with a criminal record .  
 
In the words of the late Dee Clarke, a powerful advocate for survivors, “It matters 
if you have a  criminal record. And it matters how you feel about yourself if on one 
hand some will say you were victimized, but the world still says  you’r e a criminal.”  
That being said, I urge you to support the passage of LD1436 . I appreciate your 
time and considerati on. Thank you.
