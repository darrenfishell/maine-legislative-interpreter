Testimony of Leo J. Delicata, Esq., Legal Services for the Elderly, in 
support of L.D.876 An Act to Expand Access to Oral Health Care in Rural 
Maine by Allowing Certain Out-of-state Dentists to Practice in Dental 
Clinics in the State before the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committees on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services
On behalf of Legal Services for the Elderly I would like to offer some brief 
comments in support of LD 876. Legal Services for the Elderly (LSE) is a 
nonprofit legal services organization and our mission is to provide free legal 
assistance to Maine’s older adults when their basic human needs are 
threatened.
This bill provides for a limited license for a dentist credentialed under the 
laws of another state, a Canadian province or a foreign country to be 
licensed to practice in Maine for the purposes of providing services in dental 
clinics when dental services from licensed  resident dentists are not 
available. The bill also directs the Board of Dental Practice, in conjunction 
with the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, to review  
options for a similar limited license for dental professionals other than 
dentists credentialed  under the laws of another state, a Canadian province or 
a foreign country and to report their findings and recommendations to the 
Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature.
A new adult dental benefit was added to the MaineCare program at the start 
of the current fiscal year. It’s a comprehensive benefit that provides adults 
with benefits comparable to private dental health insurance. Prior to that 
development adults could only receive what amounted to emergency dental 
care under the old MaineCare dental program.
2Because of the prior lack of access to dental care most low-income older 
adults did not receive any dental care and as a result their oral health is not 
the best. In fact, the most current Maine statistics from the U.S. Center for 
Disease Control statistics are from 2020. They estimate that adults aged 65+ 
who have lost six or more teeth due to tooth decay or gum disease approach 
40 percent. The statistics also show that Adults aged 65+ who have lost all 
of their natural teeth due to tooth decay or gum disease approach 20 per cent.
A rather large link to the CDC site is included at the end of this testimony. 
It is undeniable that there is a pent-up demand for adult dental services and it 
is also undeniable that the need cannot be met by the currently available    
oral health services available. Most adults will not receive the dental benefits 
that they are entitled to receive through the MaineCare program. As a result 
their oral health will continue to deteriorate as will the chronic health 
conditions that many older adults experience. That will inevitably lead to 
increased costs for the State and a decrease in an older adult’s quality of life.
We support any effort to increase the number of dentists and associated 
dental health professionals available to provide services to Maine people.
It is immensely frustrating to everyone that low income older adults who 
believed that the new dental benefit would give them the means to access 
dental care now lack the providers to deliver the care. 
This bill will help address the need and provides a concrete suggestion to the 
Board of Dental Practice that may assist in forming a longer-term solution. 
We hope that you will vote it ought to pass and thank you for giving us the 
opportunity to share our thoughts with you.
