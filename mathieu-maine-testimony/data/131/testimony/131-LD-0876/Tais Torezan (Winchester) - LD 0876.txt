My name is Dr. Tais Torezan and I’ve been a Limited Intern License Dentist in Massachusetts
for the past 2.5 years. I work in a Community Health Center in Lowell where thousands of 
people seek healthcare daily. 
I earned my Dental degree back in 2001 in Brazil and a few years later I became an 
Endodontist and a Prosthodontist. Before my hire, patients had no access to root canal 
treatments and crowns. My Dental Director at that time stated that it was very difficult to 
attract fully licensed Dentists to the Health Center let alone specialists. So when I was hired, 
the Health Center was able to give the community access to specialty care as well as the 
surrounding Health Centers that don’t have any specialists. We have a very successful dental
practice with 7 providers where 5 are foreign-trained Limited Licensed Intern Dentists and 
only I do specialties.
All over Massachusetts more than 300 sites of the 52 Community Health Center 
organizations have taken Foreign-trained Dentists to become part of their team and are 
thriving in giving care to the rural and underserved population.
Recently I received a job offer in rural Maine at a non-profit organization that has been 
struggling to hire Dentists and staff overall. The interest in my hire is due to my Endodontist 
degree (root canal expertise) which would be of great help not only for this clinic but for 
several Medicaid providers that need to refer root canals since there are none in the area that
take the insurance. This Limited License would make my hire possible and to many others 
who seek a starting career in the USA as a foreign-trained Dentist.
I advocate for this type of License whereas many more Maine citizens have access to 
Medicaid will be able to receive care.
