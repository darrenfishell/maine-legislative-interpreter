Diego Limoeiro
LD 876
I am Dr. Diego Limoeiro, and I am a fully licensed dentist in VT. Before working here, I 
worked for almost 2 years in North Adams, MA as a limited licensed dentist. 
An intern limited license dentist can be a foreign-trained dentist who complies with some 
requirements. And this license offers the opportunity to deliver care in dental offices 
authorized by the Board / DPH. 
I was working in North Adams, which is one the poorest city in MA. It is a small city where just
very few dentists were delivering care for people in need, especially Medicaid.  The office that
I was working for was the only one with doors opened for emergency appointments, and I had
patients traveling 40 miles to see me. 
The area has the hardship to attract fully licensed dentists and the limited licensed ones can 
help the community.
 It is a great opportunity for foreign dentists (who can start in the US dental field - under 
supervision), and for the community. 
I can totally say that MA intern limited dental license is a great success from my perspective, 
and may be a great choice for other states which struggles to attract dentists, especially to 
either rural or underserved communities.
