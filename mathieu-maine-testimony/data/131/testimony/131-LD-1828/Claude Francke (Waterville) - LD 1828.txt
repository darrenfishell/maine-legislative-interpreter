Claude Francke
Waterville
LD 1828
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology, I am Claude Francke, member of 
the Waterville City Council.  I appear before you today to support LD 1828, An Act 
Regarding Enhanced 9-1-1 Public Safety Answering Points.
The Waterville Regional Communications Center currently provides dispatch services
for nine communities in Northern Kennebec County.  The Waterville Regional 
Communications Center is certified in Emergency Medical Dispatch and Emergency 
Fire Dispatch, staples of PSAP services; therefore Waterville is prepared to step up 
and provide this critical service to our customer communities.
Under LD 1828, the Emergency Services Communications Bureau would be allowed 
to establish another PSAP on the determination that it was necessary to ensure public 
safety services and access to E-9-1-1 services.  Since Waterville and the nine 
surrounding communities need this service, and since Waterville is prepared and able 
to take on this roll, I urge you to vote "ought to pass" on this bill.   Thank you.
