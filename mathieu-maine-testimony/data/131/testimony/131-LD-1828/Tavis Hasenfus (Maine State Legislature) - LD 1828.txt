Testimony of Rep. Tavis Hasenfus in support of 
LD 1828, An Act Regarding Enhanced 9-1-1 Public Safety Answering Points 
Before the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee 
Good afternoon, Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and members of the Energy, Utilities and 
Technology Committee. My name is Tavis Hasenfus, and I represent House District 57, which is the 
communities of Readﬁeld and Winthrop. I am here before you today in strong support of LD 1828, An 
Act Regarding Enhanced 9-1-1 Public Safety Answering Points. 
On July ls‘ , 2023, a number of municipalities within Kennebec County will be without E-9-1-1 Public 
Safety Answering Points. These communities are currently served by the Somerset County Regional 
Communications Center, but the PSAP contracts will not be renewed. Therefore, we ask that the 
Emergency Services Communications Bureau establish another PSAP in order to ensure public safety 
services continue seamlessly. 
I believe the E-9-1-1 Council and local municipal officials have laid out the necessity of this legislation 
and the need for urgency quite well in their written testimony. I ask this committee to support LD 1828 
and to act swiftly in order to ensure continued E-9-1-1 services. 
Thank you, and I am happy to answer any questions you have for me.
