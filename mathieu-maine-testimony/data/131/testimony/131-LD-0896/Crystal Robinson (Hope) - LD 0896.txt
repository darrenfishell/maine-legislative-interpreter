I am a Maine Farm Bureau member.  I am now covered under Medicare but I firmly 
believe in free choice and the free market for healthcare.  Healthcare was more 
affordable and the quality of care was better when we had free choice.
Please allow Maine Farm Bureau members to join the Tennessee Farm Bureau Plan or
whatever plan they choose.    
Thank you for your work on this committee and for listening to my opinion.  
Unfortunately, I cannot attend in person or on Zoom today.
