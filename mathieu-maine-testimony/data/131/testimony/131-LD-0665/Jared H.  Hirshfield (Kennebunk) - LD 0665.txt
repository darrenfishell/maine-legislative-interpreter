Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on 
Housing,
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
regarding
LDs
214
and
665..
LD2003,
while
well
intentioned,
failed
to
account
for
many
factors
such
as
municipal 
compliance
and
the
feasibility
of
af fordable
housing
developments
in
certain
areas.
It
is 
important
when
looking
at
state
mandates
for
af fordable
housing
to
look
at
what
has
worked
in 
other
states
and
what
hasn’ t.
The
States
of
New
Jersey
and
Pennsylvania
of fer
compelling
insights
into
statewide 
af fordable
housing
policy
as
the
judiciaries
of
both
states
have
set
statewide
standards
for
the 
development
of
af fordable
housing.
The
model
enacted
in
LD2003
more
closely
resembles
New
Jersey’ s
model
for
af fordable 
housing
development.
The
New
Jersey
model
allows
developers,
with
little
to
no
input
from 
municipalities,
to
build
higher
density
af fordable
housing
developments.
The
Pennsylvania 
model,
however ,
allowed
higher
density
housing
to
be
built
with
cooperation
from
the 
municipality .
Municipalities
would
have
to
determine
‘realistically
available
zones’
for
lower 
cost,
higher
density
housing
to
be
built.

The
New
Jersey
model,
which
allowed
for
less
municipal
input
resulted
in
substantially 
less
af fordable
development
occurring.
This
has
been
lar gely
attributed
to
the
lack
of
input 
allowed
by
municipalities
in
these
af fordable
housing
developments.

This
type
of
failure
of
statewide
zoning
mandates
is
not
limited
to
New
Jersey . 
Massachusetts
adopted
mandatory
inclusionary
zoning
policies
at
the
statewide
level
through 
Chapter
40B,
which
allows
the
state
to
overrule
local
zoning
ordinances
for
af fordable
housing 
developments
if
the
municipality
does
not
meet
af fordability
requirements.

The
Massachusetts 
program
failed
because
smaller
municipalities
lacked
the
resources
to
work
with
developers.

(W inter
