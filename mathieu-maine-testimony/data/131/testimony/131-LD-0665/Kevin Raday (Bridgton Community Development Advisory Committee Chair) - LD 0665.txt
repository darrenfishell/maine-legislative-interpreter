Bridgton Community Development Advisory Committee Chair
LD 665
It took Bridgton (5,600 pop.) over 4 years and some $62,000 in legal fees to draft, 
hold public hearings, and adopt a Land Use Ordinance. Even with that thorough 
preparation, there have been snafus and unintended consequences that have required 
two amendments to correct. Trying to implement LD2003 with limited guidelines and
within a matter of a couple of months is impossible for a town of the size and staffing 
of Bridgton. 
We strongly back MMA in supporting LD665!
