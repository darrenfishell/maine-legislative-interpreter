Good
afternoon
Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Select
Committee
on
Housing.
I
am
Chris
Johnson,
Chair
of
the
Select
Board
in
the
T own
of
Somerville.
I
of fer
this
testimony
today
solely
in
that
capacity ,
writing
in
support
of
L.D.
665
on
behalf
of
the
Select
Board
and
the
Planning
Board
of
the
T own
of
Somerville.
Somerville
is
the
northernmost
extreme
of
Lincoln
County ,
near
the
headwaters
of
the
Sheepscot
Stream
which
runs
through
town
before
becoming
the
Sheepscot
River .
W e
are
nestled
on
and
around
Hisler
Mountain,
Crummett
Mountain,
and
T urner
Ridge
in
forested
land
and
farmland
dotted
with
ponds,
vernal
pools,
and
wetlands.
W e
are
nestled
between
Knox
County
on
the
east,
W aldo
County
on
the
North,
Kennebec
County
on
the
W est,
and
the
rest
of
Lincoln
County
on
the
South.
Somerville
is
a
small
town
of
approximately
600
people
which
values
its
unspoiled
rural
nature
and
natural
habitat.
Public
Law
2021,
chapter
672
has
complex
implications
for
the
T own
of
Somerville,
requiring
amendments
to
existing
ordinances
and
the
addition
of
new
ordinances
to
address
these
implications.
The
T ownâ€™ s
Planning
Board
began
studying
the
issue
at
least
8
months
ago
but
has
many
more
questions
to
answer
and
policies
to
consider
while
the
July
1,
2023
deadline
looms.
W e
have
no
public
water
or
sewer ,
but
that
just
means
that
how
the
land
and
code
safely
support
a
potential
doubling
(or
more)
of
dwellings
on
existing
lots
is
just
one
of
the
complications
that
require
clarity .
For
example,
exploring
the
nature
of
permissible
structures
has
led
to
the
realization
that
Somerville
needs
to
implement
well
conceived
and
well
defined
occupancy
permit
requirements.
Something
we
are
entirely
lacking
today .
W e
have
much
to
consider
and
too
little
time
to
contemplate
alternatives
and
engage
townspeople
in
obtaining
their
input
on
issues
which
could
profoundly
alter
the
character
of
the
town,
or
have
adverse
consequences
such
as
more
housing
structures,
but
not
more
that
are
af fordable
by
the
people
living
here
once
material
costs,
additional
drilled
well
costs
and
expanded
septic
systems
are
taken
into
account.
W ill
the
boom
in
permissible
structures
lead
to
a
race
to
repurpose
farmland
and
forever
lose
agricultural
use
of
valuable
agricultural
soil?
W ill
unbroken
wildlife
corridors
become
patches
of
housing
developments?
How
do
we
do
this
right?
The
extension
to
July
1,
2025
provided
by
L.D.
665
will
be
very
helpful
in
allowing
the
T own
of
Somerville
and
its
Planning
Board
adequate
time
to
get
it
right
and
make
wise
decisions

balancing
housing
af fordability ,
quality
of
life,
and
the
rural
appeal
of
our
town
for
those
who
choose
to
call
Somerville
home,
whether
descended
from
original
settlers
or
new
to
Maine.
On
April
4,
2023
the
Select
Board
voted
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
L.D.
665.
On
April
7,
2023
the
Planning
Board
also
voted
its
support
of
L.D.
665.
W e
ur ge
you
to
vote
ought
to
pass
on
L.D.
665.
Sincerely ,
Christopher
K.
Johnson 
Chair ,
Select
Board 
T own
of
Somerville
