LD 665

To the Members of the Committee on Housing
131st Maine Legislature, First Regular Session-2023
Comments for public hearing on April 11, 2023 
Re: speaking in favor of LD 665
Dear Honorable Committee Members,
This bill makes sense.  It allows smaller towns with volunteer committees, small legal
budgets,  and a town meeting form of government the time necessary to give due 
consideration to implement LD 2003, “An Act To Implement the Recommendations 
of the Commission To Increase Housing Opportunities in Maine by Studying Zoning 
and Land Use Restrictions” passed last year.   The Department of Economic and 
Community Development is still in the process and/or just recently providing 
guidance for the small towns.  There is the hope that a model ordinance will be 
forthcoming from the DECD such as when the shoreland zoning was initially enacted.
The Towns need more time and this proposed LD 665 will provide it.  
Our zoning ordinance has been developed and amended over the last 50 years or so to
preserve the rural character of the town while providing for orderly expansion and 
preserving the quality of life for the town’s residents.  With a subject as important as 
affordable housing, I respectfully request that you give the towns and state agencies 
the time needed to properly incorporate the new laws into the zoning ordinances.
Thank you for your consideration of my thoughts and comments.
Respectfully yours,
Jim
