Before
the
Joint
Select
Committee
on
Housing
Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
distinguished
members
of
the
Housing
Committee,
my 
name
is
T if fany
Roberts
and
I
represent
House
District
149
and
the
communities
of
North
and 
South
Berwick.
I
am
here
before
you
today
as
a
co-sponsor
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
665,
An 
Act
to
Extend
the
Date
by
Which
Compliance
is
Requir ed
for
Affordable
Housing 
Development,
Incr eased
Numbers
of
Dwelling
Units
and
Accessory
Dwelling
Units.
I
would
like
to
first
thank
Representative
Hepler
for
introducing
this
bill,
and
for
providing
me 
the
opportunity
to
co-sponsor
it.
I
would
also
like
to
thank
the
committee
for
stepping
up
to
help 
address
the
housing
shortage
crisis
we
have
in
our
state.
Y our
work
does
not
go
unnoticed
and
is 
greatly
appreciated.
I
support
this
bill
and
the
various
measures
put
forth
to
increase
our
housing
stock;
while
this 
may
sound
odd,
I
can
assure
you
that
the
two
positions
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
On
one
hand, 
we
are
dealing
with
the
development
and
passage
of
policy
and
the
other
is
dealing
with
the 
execution
of
it.
T oday
I
am
speaking
about
the
execution.
Like
some
of
the
members
of
the 
committee,
I
supported
the
passage
of
LD
2003
in
the
130th
Legislature.
Also,
like
some
of
you, 
I
have
been
hearing
from
municipalities
that
there
is
just
no
way
that
they
can
be
in
compliance 
by
the
current
July
1
deadline
of
this
year .
I
do
not
think
that
there
is
blame
to
be
had
on
any
party
in
this
situation.
I
know
that
the 
municipalities
I
represent
have
every
intention
to
adopt
Land
Use
Ordinances
to
be
in 
compliance.
I
also
know
from
multiple
conversations
with
DECD
that
they
are
doing
everything 
they
can
to
facilitate
their
end
of
the
process.
The
fact
still
remains
that
the
timelines
do
not
line 
up.
As
we
proceed
with
our
work
in
Augusta
this
week
and
in
the
past
weeks,
municipalities
at 
home
have
been
holding
their
T own
Meetings.
It
is
at
these
meetings
that
many
would
be
D i s t r i c t

P a r t
o f
N o r t h
B e r w i c k
a n d
P a r t
o f
S o u t h
B e r w i c k

required
to
present
their
new
or
revised
ordinances
to
the
voters.
How
would
this
even
be 
possible
when
the
final
rule-making
and
standing
up
of
the
grant
program
is
not
complete?
I
ask
the
committee
to
ponder
the
question
of
how
we
can
expect
our
communities
to
step
up
to 
the
plate
and
help
to
meet
the
challenge
of
increasing
housing
when
we
are
not
giving
them
the 
tools
to
succeed.
W e
cannot
expect
them
to
have
adopted
ordinances
based
on
interim 
rule-making
when
all
the
information
was
not
there.
W e
cannot
assume
that
they
have
planners 
on
staf f
to
navigate
these
changes,
and
when
they
do
not,
we
do
not
have
the
financial
resources 
available
to
them
to
bring
in
expertise.
Since
I
believe
both
my
municipalities
and
regional 
planning
commission
will
be
either
testifying
or
providing
written
testimony ,
I
will
not
get 
further
into
the
details
of
the
hurdles
each
one
faces.
There
is
one
other
angle
of
this
that
I
ask
the
committee
to
consider .
W e
all
came
up
to
Augusta 
to
represent
our
communities.
While
in
this
particular
bill,
at
face
value,
we
are
representing
the 
local
government,
it
also
can
af fect
our
constituents.
If
someone
was
a
property
owner
in
one
of 
your
municipalities,
one
that
will
not
be
in
compliance
by
July
1,
and
wanted
to
take
advantage 
of
LD
2003
and
build
an
ADU
for
a
long-term
rental
for
workforce
housing,
what
are
they
to
do? 
The
current
ordinance
may
not
allow
it,
so
it
gets
denied,
but
as
of
July
1,
the
state
law
will. 
Does
that
mean
a
trip
to
the
local
ZBA?
What
then?
T o
the
legal
system?
It
seems
like
we
also 
need
to
consider
the
position
we
will
be
putting
folks
in
who
want
to
contribute
to
the
housing 
market.
I
realize
that
this
extension
is
not
the
ideal
scenario
for
the
implementation
of
the
law ,
but
I
truly 
fear
the
issues
that
will
arise
if
we
do
not
address
this,
and
the
position
our
municipalities
will
be 
put
in
by
our
actions.
In
your
deliberations
of
this
bill,
I
ask
for
your
support,
and
if
amended,
it 
will
allow
a
reasonable
time
for
the
rules
to
be
finalized,
the
grant
program
stood
up
and
be 
allotted
so
that
the
towns
not
in
compliance
can
get
there.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration,
and
I
would
happily
answer
any
questions.
