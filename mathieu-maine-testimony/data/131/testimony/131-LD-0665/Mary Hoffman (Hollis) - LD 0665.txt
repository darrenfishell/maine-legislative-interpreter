LD 665
I am on the Select Board for Hollis, Maine.
I feel that this LD 665 should be fully supported to extend the effective date of the 
affordable housing law LD2003. The timeframe for implementation needs to be 
extended for two years.
Many smaller municipalities do not have the staff to provide research and 
recommendations for ordinance changes in a timely manner.
Many smaller municipalities have lost staff members that are an integral part of 
affording major changes to land use ordinances.
Changes to zoning requires careful consideration of the future impacts of those 
changes and what elements that need to be considered when making such changes.  
The Select Board of Hollis feels that this process should be carefully implemented so 
that it makes sense, is articulate in the message, and easy to implement. This change 
in the law that was passed in LD2003 appears to me to be crisis management of a 
housing shortage and not something that was well researched and thought about prior 
to passing. Maybe, instead of just extending the time frame, the legislators should 
look closely at what it is that was passed and the implications for all communities in 
the State of Maine.
The residents of my town want to remain a rural community rather than an 
overcrowded bedroom community of Hollis.
Let's step back and allow all communities to implement the law with careful 
consideration of what impact the changes will make.
