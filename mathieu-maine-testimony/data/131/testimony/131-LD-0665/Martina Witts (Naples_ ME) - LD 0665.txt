LD 665
Dear Committee Members, 
My name is Martina Witts, I live in Naples, ME and serve as Vice Chair of the Naples
Planning Board. I am writing in support of LD 665, An Act to Extend the Date by 
Which Compliance is Required for Affordable Housing Development, Increased 
Numbers of Dwelling Units and Accessory Dwelling Units
The time and financial pressures placed on municipalities to comply with LD 2003 by
July 1 are burdensome, particularly to small towns with limited staff and which rely 
heavily on volunteer boards to accomplish this work.   More time is needed so that we
have the benefit of fully developed state guidance, which is still in process, more time
to hold required community public hearings on their changes, and more time to 
include new ordinances on the town warrant in time for the annual town meeting. 
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 665. 
Sincerely, 
Martina Witts
Naples, ME
Vice Chair, Naples Planning Board
Member, Ordinance Review Committee
