LD 665
I am a planning board member in the town of Fryeburg. We have had numerous 
discussions and meetings regarding LD 2003 over the past year. As a town we have 
paid lawyers to help us understand the law. Everyone is confused and unclear about 
the law, including the lawyers. Towns like ours do not have the resources to deal with
incorporating this law into our ordinance. It is frankly irresponsible of the legislature 
to impose this law across the board. The law itself is irresponsible. The result of the 
law will be haphazardly built units in peoples backyards. It will be an embarrassment 
to architecture and planning. It will wreck the fabric and centuries-old land use 
patterns of our towns. The least that could be done is to extend the date.
