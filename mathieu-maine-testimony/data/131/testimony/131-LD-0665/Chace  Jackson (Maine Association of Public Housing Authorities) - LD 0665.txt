 
Testimony of the Maine Association of Public Housing Authority Directors 
131st Legislature 
Joint Select Committee on Housing 
RE: LD 214, LD665, and LD1154  
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing. 
The Maine Association of Public Housing Authority Directors membership consists of twenty 
local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) across the state of Maine, with Public Housing 
Executive Directors from Sanford to Fort Fairfield. Thank you for the opportunity to submit 
testimony in opposition to LD214, LD665, and LD1154.  
The enactment of PL 672 during the previous legislative session marked a significant turning 
point in addressing the pressing issue of Maine's ongoing housing crisis. This groundbreaking 
bipartisan bill sought to streamline bureaucracy and equip residential property owners with 
the necessary tools to tackle the state's affordable housing challenges. The legislation laid the 
groundwork for the development of more affordable housing options by permitting the 
construction of accessory dwelling units or duplexes on single-family properties. 
Despite the headway made by PL 672, challenges persist in the form of bills such as LD214, 
LD665, and LD1154, which aim to decelerate the efforts to cut bureaucratic red tape and 
address Maine's housing crisis. These bills pose a threat to the opportunities created by 
PL672, undermining its potential benefits. It is essential to acknowledge that the scarcity of 
affordable housing impacts every individual in Maine and that concerted action is needed 
across all towns and communities. 
LD214, in particular, seeks to restrict the application of the law to municipalities with 
populations exceeding 10,000, which encompasses a mere 4% of Maine's 483 municipalities. 
The support for PL 672 was far-reaching, with advocates from across the state, local and 
municipal elected officials, and the 130th legislature all endorsing this transformative policy. 
Although the passage of PL 672 was a significant accomplishment, the battle for affordable 
housing is far from over. 
The dire consequences of the lack of affordable housing extend beyond the economy, 
impacting the health and well-being of Maine's residents. Numerous people face difficulties in 
securing safe and affordable housing, resulting in heightened stress, deteriorating health 
outcomes, and financial instability. It is of paramount importance that we persist in our efforts 
to guarantee that every individual in Maine has access to affordable housing. A just society 
must ensure that all its citizens have the opportunity to lead a dignified life, which includes 
access to safe and affordable housing. Failing to address this issue exacerbates social 
inequality and undermines the foundations of a fair and compassionate community. 
We call upon the committee to oppose LD214, LD665, and LD1154, as their passage would 
constrain and postpone the much-needed solutions to Maine's housing crisis. By championing 
legislation that broadens housing options and resisting bills that hinder progress, we can 
effect significant and positive change in the lives of Maine's residents. 
The importance of PL 672 to the state of Maine cannot be overstated. Its passage has been 
instrumental in initiating the process of reform and laying the foundation for future 
improvements in housing affordability. As a critical step in the right direction, it has provided a 
blueprint for continued progress. 
In conclusion, while the enactment of PL 672 was an essential stride towards addressing 
Maine's housing crisis, there remains a substantial amount of work to be done. It is vital that 
we continue to move forward, taking decisive action to ensure that every person in Maine has 
access to secure, affordable housing. By supporting progressive legislation and standing 
against bills that impede growth, we can make a lasting and meaningful difference in the lives 
of Maine's residents.
