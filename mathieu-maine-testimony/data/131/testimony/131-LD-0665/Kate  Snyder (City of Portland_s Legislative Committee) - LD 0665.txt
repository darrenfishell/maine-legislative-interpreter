Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Housing:
I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portland’ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
Support
of
LD
665,
An
Act
to
Extend
the
Date
by
Which
Compliance
is
Required
for
Af fordable
Housing
Development,
Increased
Numbers
of
Dwelling
Units
and
Accessory
Dwelling
Units.
The
passage
of
LD
2003
was
a
meaningful
step
toward
increasing
housing
opportunities
and
af fordability
throughout
our
state.
The
City
of
Portland
has
already
introduced
many
of
the
solutions
included
in
LD
2003,
or
solutions
similar
to
those
included,
and
have
found
them
to
be
helpful
in
guiding
housing
development
in
our
municipality .
While
Portland
Land
Use
Code
already
complies
with
or
exceeds
many
of
the
new
mandates,
there
are
discrepancies
that
need
to
be
reconciled
prior
to
full
implementation.
W e
will
rely
heavily
on
the
Department
of
Economic
and
Community
Development’ s
guidance
and
rule-making
process
to
inform
our
implementation,
and
ask
that
the
implementation
deadline
be
extended
to
allow
for
DECD
to
complete
its
process.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
