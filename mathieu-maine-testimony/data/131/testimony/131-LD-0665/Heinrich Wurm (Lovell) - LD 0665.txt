LD 665
Hello, I am resident of Lovell, Maine and a 3-year member of the town's Planning 
Board and Comprehensive Plan Review Committee. I am writing to express my 
support for LD665 today, as I believe towns and citizens in general need more time to
assess the impact of the bill and raise the money required to receive professional 
advice and legal assistance to comply with the requirements of the bill. Thank you.
