LD 665
I am writing to oppose LD 665. LD 2003 went through an extensive process with a lot
of compromise. Please do not grant this extension just because certain municipalities 
were slow to react (or are opposed in the first place). There is no bigger issue pressing
Mainers right now than housing and we need every tool we can to build more and 
keep our State moving in the right direction.
