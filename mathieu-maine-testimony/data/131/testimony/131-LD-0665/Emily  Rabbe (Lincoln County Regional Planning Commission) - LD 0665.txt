RE: Support of LD 665, An Act to Extend the Date by Which Compliance is Required for 
Affordable Housing Development, Increased Numbers of Dwelling Units and Accessory 
Dwelling Units  
 
 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere , and members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing : 
 
We write to you today in support of LD 665, An Act to Extend the Date by Which Compliance is 
Required for Affordable Housing Development, Increased Numbers of Dwelling Units and 
Accessory Dwelling Units . 
 
The Lincoln County Regional Planning Commissio n (LCRPC) serves the nineteen (19) 
municipalities within Lincoln County, Maine, providing regional planning; land use; economic and 
community development; transportation; broadband planning; and environmental sustainability 
technical assistance. We have pr ovided planning assistance and collaborated with key agencies 
on affordable housing efforts in the midcoast region for years, with the focus becoming more 
acute since the beginning of the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
Growth in our year -round population has been st eady over the past twenty (20) years, although 
the rate of new housing production has slowed dramatically. 2,664 units were added to the 
County’s housing stock in the 2000s decade, while during the 2010s only 115 units were added. 
In addition, growth in th e median home sale price in Lincoln County has far exceeded median 
household income growth, with about 4,115 Lincoln County households now being considered 
‘housing cost -burdened’, or 26% of all households in the County. For households below $50,000, 
about  3,445 households are cost-burdened  or about 56% of al l households in this income range. 
Renters, and particularly senior renters, comprise a disproportionate share of cost -burdened 
households. These rates of cost burden are on par with the State as a whol e.

 A need for affordable housing opportunities exists in Lincoln County, and throughou t the State 
of Maine and LD  20031 offers an opportunity to increase the number of dwelling units  being 
constructed . 
 
However, in order for towns to implement the changes set forth in LD  2003 additional time is 
necessary .  
 
The July 1st deadline is rapidly approaching and the delays in guidance , final rule making,  and 
funding for LD2003 implementation from the State has impacted the ability for municipalities to 
develop ordinances in compliance with the legislation and move it through their local approval 
process. Additionally the Housing Opportunities Program funding is not yet available for service 
providers, such as LCRPC, to provide technical assistance to towns on LD  2003 implementation.  
 
LD 2003 offers a number of strategies to increase housing units within our State but 
implementation should be done intelligently rather than rushed to meet an unrealistic  deadline.  
Extending the implementation deadline to July 1,  2025 would also allow municipalities the 
opportunity to take a more thoughtful approach to amending their land use ordinances.  
 
We strongly urge you to support LD 665, An Act to Extend the Date by Which Compliance is 
Required for Affordable Housing Develo pment, Increased Numbers of Dwelling Units and 
Accessory Dwelling Units .   
 
 
 
Sincerely,
