Senator

Representative
Stover ,
and
Distinguished
Members

Government
Committee,
My
name
is
W ill
Sedlack
and
I
am
the
Political
Director
of
Maine
Conservation
V oters.
I
am
writing
in
strong
support
of
LD
1573,
"An
Act
to
Provide
Financial
Relief
for
Certain
V olunteers
Under
the
Corporation
for
National
and
Community
Service,
the
Maine
Service
Fellows
and
the

Maine
Conservation
V oters
is
an
or ganization
with
more
than
13,000
members
and
supporters.
W e
work
to
build
an
inclusive
democracy
and
to
make
conservation
and
climate
action
a
political
priority .
This
simple
but
ef fective
legislation
is
a
powerful
signal
to
young
Mainers
that
public
service
through
programs
like
Americorps
and
the
Maine
Climate
Corps
is
a
valued
contribution
to
society
and
deserving
of
consideration
during
tax
season.
Building
a
strong
civic
society
is
essential
to
ensuring
the
long-term
success
of
an
inclusive
democracy .
While
this
legislation
is
good
public
policy ,
it
is
also
personally
important
to
me.
I
served
with
AmeriCorps
over
a
decade
ago
as
a
children's
librarian
in
Burlington,
V ermont.
It
was
an
honor
to
serve,
but
I
was
surprised
to
learn
that
the
education
award
that
I
received
and
then
used
to
become
a
public
school
teacher
here
in
Maine
was
taxed.
This
taxation
felt
counter
to
the
intent
of
the
program,
which
is
to
provide
opportunities
for
national
service
volunteers
to
gain
valuable
experience
while
also
earning
funds
to
support
their
education.
It
also
felt
counter
to
the
intent
of
the
tax
regime
writ
lar ge,
that
is,
to
incentivize
or
disincentive
certain
behavior
while
collecting
revenue
for
the
public
good.
From
the
incentivization
of
home
ownership
through
the
mortgage
interest
tax
deduction
to
the
myriad
of
tax
benefits
associated
with
marriage,
governments
routinely
use
the
tax
code
to
further
public
goals.
Incentivizing
public
service
should
be
added
to
that
list.
National
service
programs
provide
a
crucial
opportunity
for
individuals
to
give
back
to
their
communities
while
also
developing
valuable
skills
and
experiences.
These
programs
are

especially
important
for
those
from
underrepresented
communities
who
may
face
barriers
to
accessing
educational
and
professional
opportunities.
However ,
the
financial
burden
that
comes
with
serving
in
these
programs
can
be
significant.
I
personally
made
less
than
$15,000
while
working
full
time
through
Americorps.
LD
1573
would
help
to
alleviate
this
burden
by
providing
financial
relief
to
those
who
choose
to
serve
through
national
service
programs.
By
subtracting
the
educational
award
or
educational
loan
payment
from
state
income
taxes,
this
legislation
would
provide
much-needed
relief
to
those
who
dedicate
their
time
and
ener gy
to
serving
their
communities.
In
conclusion,
I
ur ge
you
to
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1573
and
to
work
to
ensure
that
it
becomes
law .
This
legislation
is
an
important
step
in
supporting
those
who
choose
to
serve
their
communities
through
national
service
programs
and
in
making
sure
that
these
programs
remain
accessible
and
viable
for
all
who
wish
to
participate
and
make
their
country
a
better
place
through
public
service.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
