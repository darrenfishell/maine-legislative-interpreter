Neither for Nor Against  
 
LD 1176 - An Act to Create Municipal Cannabis Revenue Sharing  
 
April 18, 2023  
 
 
Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry and members of the Taxation Committee, my name is Rebecca 
Lambert and I am providing testimony neither for nor against  LD 1176  on behalf of the Maine Municipal 
Associationâ€™s (MMA) Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For reference , the LP C provides direction to the 
advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Local  governments across the country who have opted into adult use cannabis  have seen benefits in 
various ways from a portion of the tax revenu e. Since the passage of the Cannabis Legalization Act in 
Maine, municipal leaders have worked diligently to develop and perfect related ordinances and arguably, 
without the support and investment from them , the revenues to the state would be significantly less.  
Sharing a portion of the sales and excise tax revenues with the communities in which the revenue was 
generated  makes sense and would help lessen the tight budgets that municipalities face annually . 
Rewarding municipalities with additional revenue sharing would also  help  to foster the 
state/municipal/industry partnership that was envisioned in 2016.  For th ese reason s, the LPC believes it 
is appropriate to share a portion of the related tax revenues with the communities in which the revenue was generat ed.     
While the LPC wholeheartedly supports this measure, the municipalities who do not allow cannabis 
establishments within their borders would not benefit from the passage of this bill and therefore are 
neither for nor against this bill.  
Thank you for your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
