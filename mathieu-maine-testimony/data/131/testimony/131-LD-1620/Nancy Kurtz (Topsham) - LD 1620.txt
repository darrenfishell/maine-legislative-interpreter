Nancy Kurtz
Topsham
LD 1620
I am Nancy Kurtz, a resident of Topsham, Maine and I support the passage of LD 
1620. This act would provide benefits to the Mi'kmaq Nation that other tribes in 
Maine have under MICSA, which the Mi'kmaq were not part of. It is only fair that all 
tribes in Maine should be on an equal footing. I urge the Committee and the 
Legislature to support and pass this bill
