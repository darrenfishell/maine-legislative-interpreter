the Laws Regardmg the Ml ’kmaq Natlon 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and d1st1ngu1shed members of the J o1nt Stand1ng 
Commlttee on Jud1c1a1y, I am Aaron Frey, and I have the pr1v1lege of servmg as Ma1ne’s Attorney 
General I am here to test1fy 1n support of L D 1620, an Act to Amend the Laws Regardmg the 
Mz ’kmaq Natzon 
Over the last several months, my ofﬁce has been engaged 1n numerous lengthy d1scuss1ons 
w1th the M1’kmaq Nat1on a.nd the Govemor’s Ofﬁce on leg1slat1on that would redeﬁne the 
_1ur1sd1ct1onal relat1onsh1p between the State and the Natlon s1m1lar to the re1at1onsh1p between the 
State and the Penobscot Natlon and the Passamaquoddy Tr1be Those d1scuss1ons were 
s1gmﬁcantly productlve, and I want to thank all those who part1c1pated I want to g1ve speclal 
thanks to the M1’kmaq Nat1on’s ch1ef and 1ts legal counsel for the1r tremendous efforts, as well as 
for the1r co1leg1al1ty In the comlng years, we look forward to bu1ld1ng on th1s pos1t1ve and fru1tful 
work1ng relat1onsh1p 
The b1ll you have before you 1s the result of these d1scuss1ons If enacted, 1t would allow 
the Natlon to exerclse var1ous powers and rece1ve certam beneﬁts w1thm M1’kmaq Nat1on 
Jur1sd1ct1on Land Th1s cons1sts of all land currently held 1n trust for the Nat1on by the Secretary 
of the Inter1or plus any subsequently acqulred land 1n Aroostook County w1th1n 50 m1les of 
ex1st1ng trust land On M1’kmaq Natlon Jur1sd1ct1on Land, the Natlon would be treated s1m1larly 
to the PenobscotNat1on and the Passamaquoddy Tnbe w1th respect to vanous matters, 1nclud1ng 
excluslve Jur1sd1ct1on over mternal tr1ba1 matters, the same power to enact ordmances as 
mun1c1pal1t1es, the regulat1on of huntmg, trapp1ng and ﬁslnng, the r1ght of the Nat1on’s members 
to take ﬁsh for the1r 1nd1v1dual sustenance, tr1bal court _]U.I‘1Sd1Cll101'1 over varlous c1v1l and cr1m1na1 
matters, and law enforcement authonty The Natlon would also be authorlzed to regulate drmkmg 
water, s1m11ar to the amendments to the Mame Implement1ng Act 1n the 13 Om Leglslature regardmg 
the author1ty of the Passamaquoddy Trrbe to regulate drmk1ng water 
Because our d1scuss1ons contlnued after the language for th1s b1ll was subm1tted to the 
Rev1sor’s Ofﬁce, some mlnor amendments to th1s b1ll may be proposed By and large, though, the 
b1ll before you reﬂects the consensus of the Nat1on, the Governor ’s Ofﬁce, and my ofﬁce 
It 1s fan" and Just to allow the M1’kmaq Nat1on to exerc1se the same attrlbutes of soverelgnty 
that other Tr1bes 1n Ma1ne have exerclsed for decades Accordmgly, I urge you to vote Ought to 
Pass on L D 1620
