LD 1620
I am writing in support of LD1620, An Act to Enact the Mi’kmaq Restoration Act. 
The Mi’kmaq Nation was not included in the 1980 settlement claim act.  This bill 
states the The State recognizes that the Mi’kmaq Nation predates the State of Maine 
and the United States and possesses the power and authority to self-govern as limited 
by the Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act and this Act. It would give them 
the right to control hunting and fishing on their land, as well as jurisdiction over water
rights,  among other things. It gives them the power of jurisdiction in their land.
This is all part of sovereignty for Maine tribes and should be passed with haste. These
people have waited too long already for their rights.
Thank you for your time.
