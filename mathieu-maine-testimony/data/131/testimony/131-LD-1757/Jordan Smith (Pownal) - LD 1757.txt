LD 1757
Greetings, I am writing today in support of LD 1757. I believe this bill can solve 
many of the shortcomings of using the METRC system currently in place. METRC 
has been a failure nationwide and is overly burdensome for the state and for cannabis 
businesses. Creating a state run user friendly portal that simplifies track and trace will 
benefit all involved. That we just paid $350,000 for a “software update” from 
METRC is blatant example of how this system is taking advantage of states and 
individuals nationwide. They have offered themselves as the best option but have 
proven time and time again that is not the case. It is a falsehood that this program 
works as it should. Operators using METRC all over the country are able to still 
divert huge amounts of product into the illicit market. So much so that “METRC 
packs” (diverted product from METRC facilities) are available everywhere. The 
program does not work and comes at great cost to all of the users and taxpayers. 
METRC is nothing short of a scam and we can do better.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Very Best,
Jordan Smith
