To the members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee,  
My name is Elizabeth Hayes. I am an organic farmer, and medical cannabis caregiver. My husband and I 
operate Panorama Seeds, and Art and Craft. I am writing to you today in STRONG SUPPORT for LD1757 
Thank you, Senator Hickman, for putting this commonsense bill forward.  
The contract with METRC is not good for the Maine cannabis industry. You have no doubt heard many 
hours of testimony regarding the burden it places on businesses. The nightmare of METRC has kept 
many cultivators, myself included, from considering entry to the adult use market.  
There is a better way for businesses to participate in a system of tracking plants and products. I do this 
in my organic farming operation. MOFGA inspectors perform a mass balance audit to ensure that all the 
products we sell were grown on our farm and that records have been kept tracking where they are sold 
and accounting for the entire harvest. This can be done with the reliable and accessible technology of 
spreadsheets and inspectors who are knowledgeable in agriculture.. We do not need to involve handing 
over large sums of money to a private, profit- driven company that has gained a monopoly on track and 
trace in legal cannabis across the country. This bill would save an incredible amount of money for adult 
use growers, which would benefit customers in reduced product costs.   
Please support this commonsense legislation and end the use of METRC in Maine.  
Thank you for taking the time to consider my position.
