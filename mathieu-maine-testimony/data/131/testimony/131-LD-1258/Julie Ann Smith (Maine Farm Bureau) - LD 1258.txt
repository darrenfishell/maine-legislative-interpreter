LD 1258 An Act To Adjust the Personal Property Tax Exemption for Farm 
Machinery  
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Committee on Taxation:  
 
My name is Julie Ann Smith and I am the Executive Director of Maine Farm Bureau, the 
state's largest grassroots farm advocacy organization. We have represented the voice of all 
agriculture in Maine for the past 70 years and I am grateful to have the opportunity to serve 
as the voice of our members today.  
 
Maine Farm Bureau's farmer-members met to discuss this issue and voted to strongly 
support this important tax exemption for agriculture.  
 
Agriculture has always been supported by the Maine Legislature through tax exemptions. 
Going back to 1874, "Hay, grain, and potatoes, orchard products and wool, owned by, and in 
possession of the producer, shall be exempted from taxation." The law was further refined in 
1970 to exempt all farm machinery used exclusively in production of hay and field crops, up 
to $5,000. In 1977, the exemption was changed from $5,000 to $10,000 to adjust for 
inflation. The exemption has not been adjusted since 1977.  
 
We are requesting a simple inflation adjustment for some farm machinery. This bill does 
not include tractors or machinery that is defined as a "self-propelled vehicle." It covers the 
implements that are necessary for farmers to do their work of growing food to feed Maine.  
 
LD 1258 is an important opportunity to help farm businesses. The cash the farmer saves 
with a tax exemption is reinvested in the farm and local community. Most importantly, it is 
used to feed the people of Maine. We urge your support for this important exemption.  
 
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine. I would be happy to answer 
any questions you may have.
