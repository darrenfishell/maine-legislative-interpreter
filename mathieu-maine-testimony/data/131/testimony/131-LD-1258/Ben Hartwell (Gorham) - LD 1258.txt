RE:
Statement
for
LD
1258,
An
Act
T o
Adjust
Personal
Property
T ax
Exemption
for
Farm
Machinery
Dear
Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry ,
and
the
T axation
Committee:
I
am
Ben
Hartwell,
a
farmer/rancher
and
former
town
councilor
in
Gorham,
and
an
attorney .
I
originally
proposed
this
bill
through
Maine
Farm
Bureau
in
the
129th
Legislature.
This
is
essentially
the
same
bill.
The
taxation
committee
previously
passed
the
bill,
it
was
carried
over
and
died
in
appropriations.
Personal
property
tax
was
something
that
was
never
really
on
my
radar
until
about
2014.
Gorham’ s
long-time
tax
assessor
retired,
and
the
T own
Council
was
faced
with
the
decision
to
try
to
replace
him
or
contract
with
Cumberland
County
to
take
over
assessing
services.
The
council
decided
to
contract
with
the
county .
One
of
the
consequences
of
contracting
with
the
county
was
that
the
County
Assessor
realized
that
many
businesses,
including
farms,
were
not
being
assessed
personal
property
tax.
She
reached
out
to
the
businesses
that
were
somewhat
easy
to
find
and
required
them
to
submit
a
form
declaring
their
assets.
It
turns
out
that,
like
many
communities
throughout
Maine
(and
not
legally),
assessors
were
instructed
to
turn
a
blind
eye
to
some
businesses.
Farms
that
were
assessed
have
an
exemption
under
36
M.R.S.A.
§655(M),
specific
to
field
and
hay
crop
equipment
which
provides
a
personal
property
tax
exemption
of
$10,000
for
specific
equipment
only
used
for
part
of
the
season.
It
was
determined
decades
ago
that
you
shouldn’ t
treat
a
hay
mower
used
a
few
months
of
the
year
the
same
as
a
lathe
in
a
machine
shop
used
daily .
Back
in
1977,
the
exemption
was
doubled
from
$5,000
to
$10,000
to
adjust
for
inflation
but
has
not
been
adjusted
since.
This
bill
seeks
to
simply
adjust
$10,000
for
inflation.
Because
the
bill
was
copied
from
2019,
it
actually
adjusts
the
exemption
to
2019
dollars,
not
2023
dollars.
This
is
an
amendment
the
committee
may
want
to
consider .
There
are
two
programs
that
I’m
sure
you
are
aware
of,
BETE
and
BETR.
BETE
is
available
to
exempt
equipment
put
into
service
after
2007
and
BETR
provides
reimbursement
for
equipment
that
isn’ t
exempt
under
BETE
but
was
put
into
service
after
1995
and
wasn’ t
exempt
under
§655(M).
Many
farms
have
older
equipment
that
doesn’ t
fall
under
BETE,
and
if
they
want
to
use
BETR
they
have
to
pay
the
taxes
and
then
wait
about
a
year
to
get
a
reimbursement.
Isn’ t
it
better
to
just
allow
the
exemption
and
not
have
to
deal
with
a
reimbursement?
Further ,
Maine
Revenue
Services
tells
us
that
BETE
and
BETR
is
only
available
for
equipment
that
is
new
to
Maine.
In
other
words,
if
I
go
to
an
equipment
dealership
and
buy
something
used,
it’ s
no
longer
available
for
BETE
and
BETR.
If
you
look
at
the
inventory
of
used
equipment
at
tractor
dealerships
and
talk
to
any
farmer ,
they’ll
likely
tell
you
that
they
have
a
significant
amount
of
equipment
that
was
purchased
used.
Another
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
the
depreciation
tables
that
most
municipalities
use
do
not
depreciate
at
the
same
rate
that
excise
tax
tables
do.
For
example,
in
Gorham,
no
matter
how
old
the
equipment
is,
it
never
gets
assessed
at
lower
than
30%
of
its
original
value!
I
ur ge
you
to
support
amending
§655(M)
to
adjust
the
$10,000
exemption
for
field
and
hay
crop
equipment
for
inflation
and
vote
“ought
to
pass”
for
LD
1258.
Sincerely ,
Benjamin
