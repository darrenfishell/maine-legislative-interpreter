In Support of  
LD 1258, An Act to Increase the Personal Property Tax Exemption for Farm Machinery  
 
April 5, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in support of LD 1258 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position o n bills of municipal interest.   
Provided that the state is willing to reimburse  – in perpetuity – municipalities  for 100% 
of the lost property tax revenues  associated  with expanding the farm machinery exemption  
municipal officials have no issue with LD 1258.   
Thank y ou for considering the municipal perspective on this bill.  If you have questions 
about the Association’s position, please do not hesitate to contact me at 1 -800-452-8786 or
