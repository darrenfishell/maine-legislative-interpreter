Re: LD 1936  – An Act to Allow Certified Nurse Practitioners to Provide In -home  
Care Without a Home Health Care Provider License  
 
Senator Bailey , Representative Perry , and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance & Financial Services : 
 
This letter is to provide information on LD 1936, An Act to Allow Certified Nurse Practitioners to 
Provide In -home  Care Without a Home Health Care Provider L icense . This bill seeks to exempt 
certified nurse practitioners from the provisions of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, chapter 
419,1 which concerns home health services and the licensure of home health care providers.   
 
The Division of Licensing and Certification  (DLC) understands the intent is to allow certified 
nurse practitioners to perform home health services without the need for a home health care 
provider license, however, this is already allowed by both  statute and  rule, (see Title 22 §2142(3)2 
and §2147(3 ),3 and 10-144 Ch . 119, Ch 1(21).4 DLC considers a “sole practitioner” to be an 
exclusion under §21475 and as a result, sole practitioners do not need  a home health provider 
license.6 
 
The Department  would be happy to provide additional information  for the work session .  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Bill Montejo , Director  
Division of Licensing and Certification
