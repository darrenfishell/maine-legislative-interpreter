LD 1936 An Act to Allow Nurse Practitioners to Provide In Home Care 
Sponsored by Rep. Anne Graham 
Testimony in Support 
Good Afternoon, Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and esteemed members of the Health Coverage, 
insurance and Financial Services Committee. My name is Jude Neveux and lam Vice President of 
WellCare Health Plans. WellCare is a Medicare Advantage plan with an ofﬁce in Saco with nearly 23,000 
Maine seniors currently enrolled. l am here to testify in support of LD 1936. 
Current law prohibits licensed nurse practitioners from providing in home care to patients unless they 
are employed by a home health agency. (22 MRS section 2147) This bill adds nurse practitioners to the 
list of providers that are exempt from this restriction. The list currently includes physicians, sole 
practitioners, nutrition programs, and hospice organizations, among others. The absence of nurse 
practitioners appears to be an oversight that will be addressed through this proposal. 
As you know, we are experiencing an overwhelming work force shortage of qualiﬁed providers, which is 
particularly acute in rural areas. ln January, we began collaborating with a company that provides 
primary care services in a variety of settings - the company was looking to contract services with licensed 
nurse practitioners in Aroostook County where we have over 4000 members. Many of these members 
haven't had an annual check-up in over two years due to access issues and lack of primary care 
providers. Current law in Maine prohibits licensed nurse practitioners unafﬁliated with a home health 
agency from providing care to some of Maine's most vulnerable citizens. By removing this prohibition, 
these seniors can receive in home services by licensed nurse practitioners as soon as the bill becomes 
law. 
Thank you for your consideration of this matter and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.
