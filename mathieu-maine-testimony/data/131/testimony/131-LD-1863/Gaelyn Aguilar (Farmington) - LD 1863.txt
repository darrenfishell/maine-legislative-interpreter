LD 1863
Greetings from Farmington. I am writing in support of LD1863. As part of this 
written testimony, I would like to direct members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee to the link below, which will take viewers to a short video I 
co-produced in collaboration with the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition. 
This video, which was produced in 2021 in support of a previous iteration of LD1863,
was made in collaboration with Bobby "Paco" Payzant, a former resident of the ME 
State Prison, a gifted Hospice Volunteer, and a tireless advocate for prison reform. 
Working with Bobby, and other returning citizens and their advocates, on issues of 
compassionate care, left an indelible impression on me. I spent many years carrying 
for my mother, who lives with dementia, in my own home, and understand the 
imperative of providing individuals, who are incarcerated, an opportunity to be cared 
for at one of the most vulnerable stages of life. 
I urge committee members to support LD1863.
Thank you! Gaelyn Aguilar
