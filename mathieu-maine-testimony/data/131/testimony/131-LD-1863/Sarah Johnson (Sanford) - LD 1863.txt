 IN SUPPORT OF LD 1863 
An Act to Facilitate the Provision of Medically Appropriate Levels of Care for Clients
of Correctional Facilities
Representative Sachs and Honorable Members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee,
My name is Sarah Johnson.  I am a Software Support Specialist and I live in Sanford. 
I am writing in support of LD 1863 which would expand compassionate release in 
Maine.
As is the case across the nation, Maine has a growing elderly population in its 
correctional facilities. Our sick and elderly incarcerated residents pose little to no risk 
to public safety. Providing proper medical care is becoming more expensive, and 
medical staffing and resources harder to come by as they are everywhere. 
Allowing critical care patients to be with family and trained medical professionals as 
they approach the end of life is compassionate, and affords families and patients the 
dignity and care that we all deserve.
Thank you for your time and consideration of this bill.
Sarah Johnson
