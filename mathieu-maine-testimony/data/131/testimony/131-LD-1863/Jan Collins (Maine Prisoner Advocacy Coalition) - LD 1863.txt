Senator Beebe-Center, Rep Salrsbury and honorable members of the Crrmmal J ustrce and Publlc 
Safety Commrttee My names rs Jan Colhns and I am assrstant drrector for Mame Prlsoner 
Advocacy Coahtron I am here today to speak m favor of LD 1863 An Act to Facilitate the 
Provlslon of Medlcally Approprlate Levels of Care for Cllents of Correctlonal Facllltres 
MPAC’s mlssron rs to support Ma1ne's rncarcerated c1t1zens,the1r famrhes, and frlends 1n thelr 
struggle wlth Mame's crlmmal JUSUCC system Our purpose 1s to reduce Mame's use of 
mcarceratron by creatmg a crrmmal _]l.lSlI1C6 system that 1s ethlcal, humane, and restoratrve 1n 
nature 
I brmg my personal expenence to thrs b1ll For decades my husband worked as a long term care 
admmrstrator In that capaclty he was sometlmes asked to take 1n a resldent of the Mame 
Department of Correctlons who was elderly, mﬁrm or dymg A socral worker was sent from the 
long term care facrhty to the prrson to evaluate the needs of the clrent and the clrent was released 
to communlty conﬁnement at the fac1l1ty 
The MDOC sent staff to check on the cllent, as rs true for all those housed under Supervrsed 
Communrty Conﬁnement, and eventually each person took therr last breath whrle housed at the 
nurslng faclllty 
Each of these men had commrtted vlolent crrmes, but each was treated wrth the same tenderness 
and humamty as any other chent As a result, one man was able to meet hrs daughter for the ﬁrst 
trme and get to know her and spend tlme wrth her before hrs death Another was able to reunlte
with hrs wrfe and take h1s last breath 1n her arms Others were able to make amends for past 
wrongs and come to terms w1th the hurt they had caused 
Eventually the case worker who had drlr gently worked to place these 1nd1v1duals 1n communlty 
care retlred Placements stopped 
It rs my hope that thrs brll w1ll make 1t easler for the Department of Correctlons to place 
lndrvrduals who are elderly, rnﬁrm, or dyrng and no longer able to carry out the tasks of darly 
hvmg rn approprrate communlty settrngs 
It 1s drfﬁcult for the department to care for rndrvrduals wlth dementla, those who need 
chemotherapy, radratron or darly krdney dralysrs Thrs medrcal care 1s spec1al1zed,and consumes 
precrous money, trme and staff 
Pnsons are not desrgned to be nursrng homes or long term care fac1l1t1es, nor should they be 
expected to 
Please support LD 1863 An Act to Facllltate the Provlslon of Medlcally Approprlate Levels 
of Care for Cllents of Correctlonal Faclhtles. 
Slncerely,
