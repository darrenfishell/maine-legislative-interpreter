In Opposltlon to 
LD 1863 An Act to Facllltate the Pl‘OVlSl0Il of Medlcally Appropr1ate Levels of Care for Cllents of 
Correctlonal Fac1l1t1es 
Before the 
Cr1rn1nalJust1ce Publxc Safety Commlttee 
May 9, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center and Representat1ve Sahsbury and other d1st1ngu1shed members of the Crumnal Just1ce 
and Publ1c Safety Comm1ttee, I am Randall L1berty, Comm1ss1oner of the Ma1ne Department of Correct1ons 
prov1du1g testunony 1n oppos1t1on to LD 1863 
Tlus b1ll 1s essentlally a repeat of LD 476 from the 130“ Leglslature, mtroduced by Rep Morales After more 
than a year of Worl<1ng together on the b1ll, the sponsor asked the b1l1voted ONTP as we were able to negot1ate 
for an outcome Rep Morales was pleased W1th Attached to th1s testnnony 1s a copy of the letter the prev1ous 
CJPS Ch3.l1‘S sent to the MDOC regardmg the dec1s1on to vote the b1ll out 
We are perplexed to see th1s b1ll come back glven the agreeable outcome and the nnmense amount of 
collaboratlve work that was done Wlth the former Senate Chart of th1s comm1ttee, Susan Deschambault, the 
sponsor, fonner representatlve V1ctor1a Morales, DHHS’s l1cens1ng d1v1s1on, the Un1vers1ty of New England’s 
School of Occupatlonal Therapy, and the stark real1ty assoc1ated w1th some of the 1ssues addressed 1n the b1ll 
We had no less than a dozen meetmgs throughout the frst and second sess1ons of the 130“ workmg to problem 
solve some of the 1ssues of th1s b1ll w1th the stakeholders l1sted above 1' 
Unfortunately, th1s b1ll, LD 1863 was only recently publ1shed, and we have had no contact w1th the sponsor We 
can only assume that s1nce the language m LD 1863 1s nearly word for Word duphcatlve of the language of LD 
476 1n the 130th that a spec1al mterest orgamzatlon has requested the sponsor reprmt the b1ll We do not know 1f 
the sponsor 1s aware of the hlstory assoc1ated w1th th1s b1ll, the des1re of Rep Morales who or1g1nated th1s b1ll, 
the deslre of the CIPS dunng the 130* , or any of the 1nfonnat1on prov1ded to the CJPS dunng the 130* spec1ﬁc 
to l1cens1ng, Medlcald funds, and challenges assoc1ated W1th nurslng home placements for 1nd1v1duals w1th 
felony charges 
Outhned below are our concerns w1th language 111 th1s b1ll 
I Regard1ng paragraph A-—Th1s 1s unnecessary As part of the reentry process res1dents rece1ve at least9 
months of d1scuss1on and planmng for reentry If part of the reentry process mcludes a res1dent gomg to 
ass1sted hvmg, nursmg home care, or hosp1ce or home health care post release, the collaboratlve

planmng to l1ve m a sober recovery home post release, We also work w1th res1dents to plan for movmg 
lnto a health care fac1l1ty post release 
Regardmg paragraph B-—Th1s part of the b1ll 1s unclear Are we berng asked to ass1st a res1dent w1th 
placement post release’? Or are we bemg asked to place a res1dent 1nto a spec1ﬁc un1t W1th1n the MDOC, 
by request, based on a Med1ca1d el1g1b1l1ty assessment? Based on the reference to MRS T1tle 22, Sect1on 
3174-I, we can assume the 1ntent 1s that the MDOC assxst a releasmg res1dent to ﬁnd and be placed mto 
a sultable communlty based ass1stedl1v1ng, nurs1ng home, or hosprce program Wlule we make every 
effort to help releasmg res1dents move 1nto these types of care resldences post release when medlcally 
necessary, the MDOC 1s unable to compel a commun1ty care fac111ty to take an 1nd1v1dual If the mtent 
of the b1ll 1s to requ1re the MDOC to house res1dents 1n specrﬁc un1ts wrthm 1ts fac111t1es based on 
Med1ca1d e11g1b1l1ty assessments, T1tle 22 Sect1on 3174-I makes 1t very clear that a res1dent ofa 
con-ect1onal fac111ty 1s not el1g1ble for Med1ca1d funded serv1ces (W1th some exceptlons related to 
hosp1tal v1s1ts) Further, “by request” 1s one of many factors, c0ns1dered when maklng an approprlate 
recommendatron about make housmg dec1s1ons, other factors mclude safety, personal con.ﬂ1cts, and 
prograrnmmg needs 
Regard1ng paragraph C—The MDOC 1s amenable to codlfymg long-term care serv1ces 1nto MDOC 
statutes Here 1s a proposed amendment, same as we offered durmg work on the prev1ous b1ll 
Proposed amendment 
Sec 1 34-A MRSA §1-402, sub-§ 14 1s enacted to read 
14 The cornm1ss1oner shall establ1sh and mamta1n or contract for long-term care serv1ces, 
1nclud1ng ass1sted l1V1ng and nurslng fac1l1ty levels of care, for prrsoners for Whom such serv1ces 
are necessary as determmed by the fac1l1ty ’s treatmg phys1c1an 
Regard1ng paragraphs D, E, F—— Ma1ne DOC’s ass1sted l1v1ng umts and the Inﬁrmary, whrch mcludes 
hosplce serv1ces, are natlonally accredlted as part of the accred1tat1on granted to each of MDOC fac1l1ty 
by the Amencan Correct1onal Assoc1at1on (ACA), whrch performs a comprehens1ve rnultl-day aud1t 
every three years Malntammg th1s accred1tat1on 1s requ1red by state statute As part of the extenswe 
Work on the same b1l1 durmg the 130* 1t was clear that requ1r1ng the MDOC to have a separate hcense to 
operate ass1sted lrvmg umts and a nursmg fac1l1ty w1thm 1ts correctlonal fac1l1t1es would not only be 
unnecessary as there are already both const1tut1onal standards that govern res1dent care and the standards 
requrred to recelve our Arnencan Correctronal Assoc1at1on accred1tat1ons, but th1s would create 
unforeseeable negat1ve changes to our current ass1sted 11vmg un1ts and Inﬁrmary and Would be qu1te 
costly DHHS l1censmg staff, who came to v1s1t our fac1l1t1es as part of th1s Work, noted that commun1ty- 
based ass1sted l1v1ng and nursmg fac1l1t1es do not cons1der res1dent and staff safety, secur1ty, or 
operanonal needs as requlred 1n a correctlonal settmg, as the Amencan Correct1ona1Assoc1at1on 
standards do Drsregardmg correctlonal standards for trad1t1onal l1cens1ng standards could result 1n 
changes to secunty, operat1ons, stafﬁng, and bu1ld1ng footprmt, resultmg 1n unnecessary costly bu1ld1ng 
alterat1ons, stafﬁng changes and safety nsks The same 1s true of Med1ca1d el1g1b1l1ty cntena, wlnch are 
not su1ted to a correctlonal context Furthennore, paragraphs D and E go well beyond the purv1ew of the

Mame Department of Corrections It would be 1mpract1cal and cost-proh1b1t1ve for the DOC to develop 
ass1sted l1v1ng and nurs1ng fac1l1t1es 1n the comrnunlty 
It IS lmportant for the commlttee to recogmze that Med1ca1d monles cannot be used to cover medical servlces 
prov1ded to 1nd1v1duals wh1le they are 1n _]E11l or prison If the MDOC went ahead wlth the costly and safety 
changes requrred for DHHS hcensmg, we would st1ll not be able to charge Med1ca1d for servlces Resldents 
who qual1fy for SCCP who Want /need resrdence m a comrnunlty-based care fac1l1ty may be Med1ca1d el1g1ble, 
but that doesn’t guarantee that the care the person requlres 1s rermbursable 
Also concemmg 1s the reference 1n the summary of the b1ll to the Superv1sed Commumty Confinement 
Program The summary suggests that the b1ll enhances and improves SCCP, but there 1S no ment1on of SCCP 1n 
th1s b1ll The summary also references makmg changes to MDOC’s polices related to SCCP, but aga1n there 1s 
no ment1on of SCCP 1n this b1ll Further the summary says that the b1ll provides guldance for the use of SCCP, 
but again there 1s no reference to SCCP 1n the body of the b1ll 
As ment1oned, the MDOC worked closely wlth Representative Morals and former CIPS Chair Senator 
Deschambault on the b1ll durmg the 130*“ Durlng conversatlons Wlth Rep Morales at the last stages of Workmg 
on the b1ll, after the work 1ns1de our ass1sted l1v1ng fac1l1ty, after the work w1th UNE, and after heanng from the 
long-term care p1'0V1d61 ‘S 1n the commun1ty, Rep Morales began to see the work we had done on our SCCP 
pOl1Cy and statute as meetmg her needs assoc1ated with the b1ll When we went through the SCCP pol1cy and 
showed her the level of access and pr1or1ty terminally 1l1 or severely mcapacrtated res1dents 1n MDOC fac1l1t1es 
had to SCCP she was very pleased 
Procedure I of MDOC’s SCCP pol1cy, copied below, allows for the Commlssioner to transfer terminally 111 or 
severely lncapacltated residents to SCCP for the purposes of rece1v1ng medlcally appropnate care 
" 
Procedure I Supervised Community Conﬁnement for a Terminally lll or Severely lncapacitated Resident 1 The 
Commissioner, or designee, with the consent of the resident, may transfer an adult facility resident serving a 
Department sentence to supervised community confinement without meeting the above eligibility, application, 
or other requirements or criteria if the Department's Director of Medical Services has determined that the 
resident has a terminal or severely incapacitating medical condition and that care outside a correctional facility 
is medically appropriate a The resident shall live in a hospital or other appropriate care facility, such asa 
nursing facility, residential care facility, or a facility that is a licensed hospice program pursuant to Title 22, 
Section 8622, approved by the Commissioner, or designee, or b As approved by the Commissioner, or designee, 
the resident may receive hospice services from an entity licensed pursuant to Title 22, Chapter 1681, Subchapter 
1 or other care services provided by an entity approved by the Commissioner, or designee, and SUb]€Ct to 
approval by the Commissioner, or designee, may live at home while receiving these sen/ices 2 The 
Commissioner, or designee, may approve a transfer pursuant to this procedure through any process that the 
Commissioner, or designee, determines appropriate, except that the Commissioner, or designee, shall consult 
with the Department's Director of Victim Services, or designee, and may exempt a resident transferred to 
supervised community confinement pursuant to this procedure from any mandatory conditions that the 
Commissioner, or designee, determines to be inapplicable 3 The Director, or designee, may request the 
Commissioner, or designee, to postpone the decision until the victim, if any, of the crime(s) for which the 
resident was, is, or will be serving the sentence during the current time and custody is notified of the proposal 
that the resident be allowed to participate in SCCP and is given the opportunity to provide input 4 The 
Commissioner, or designee, shall document the decision in CORIS 5 All decisions made pursuant to this

appealed 6 The client shall provide any information pertaining to the client's medical condition or care that is 
requested by the Commissioner, or designee, at any time while the client IS on supen/ised community 
conﬁnement lfthe Commissioner, or designee, determines that the client has failed to fully comply witha 
request or if at any time the Department's Director of Medical Services determines that the client does not have 
a terminal or severely incapacitating medical condition or that care outside a correctional facility is not medically 
appropriate, the Commissioner, or designee, shall revoke the transfer to supen/ised community conﬁnement In 
addition, a client transferred to supervised community conﬁnement pursuant to this procedure may be removed 
from supen/ised community conﬁnement at any time for any reason at the complete discretion of the 
Commissioner, or designee, and this decision may not be appealed 
We ask this committee to vote ONTP, to recognize the Work that was done by the previous legislature, 
mcludmg the former senate chair of this committee and because the MDOC has in place model assisted living, 
nursing home level, and hospice services 
If the committee or sponsor would like to work on legislation centered around compelling members of the long- 
tenn care commumty to accept individuals regardless of their criminal records, We would be pleased to support 
that

The Cnmmal Justice and Public Safety Committee has held a public hearing and three work 
sessions on LD 476 and has discussed thoroughly the need for assisted living and nursing facility 
levels of care foi persons in the custody of the Department of Corrections. While working on 
LD 476 committee members learned that the Department of Corrections provides access to care 
for seriously and terminally ill and disabled clients of the department both within correctional 
facilities and ui the community Committee members were pleased to learn that the Department 
of Corrections IS conducting an educational effort to ensure that clients of the department are 
informed of the availability of assisted living and nursing facility levels of care 
We write to ask that the Department of Corrections contuiue its educational efforts and report 
back to the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee by January 15, 2023 on those efforts
