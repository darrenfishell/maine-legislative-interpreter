Testimony in favor of LD 18 63 
to the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety  
May 9, 2023 
Senator Beebe -Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the 
Committee : 
My name is Peter Lehman and I live in Thomaston.  
As you all know, I served a six year sentence beginning at the old prison in 
Thomaston. I want to talk with you today about the PEOPLE w ho grow old and die 
in prison. And their friends and loved ones.  
As in our community outside, many of the leaders of the prison community are the 
older men, some of whom die there.  
I want to remember a friend from the old prison who helped and guided me w hen I 
was there. Younger than I was, Dean was active in the church community and was 
serving a life sentence because he had a fatal disease. But he never gave up and 
always lent a hand.  
Unlike some jailhouse Christians, Dean really tried to live his faith. He helped guide and support me, this bewildered college professor in this alien land.  
I was not the only resident he helped. He was one of the men who supported and 
embodied the redemp tive community that can be possible even inside those dark 
walls.  
He died while I was at Bolduc and was buried there. I was the Bolduc gardener and remember kneeling in my flower bed watching the burial service from afar and 
crying with grief for my falle n friend.  
In his honor, I urge you to vote Ought to Pass.   
I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
