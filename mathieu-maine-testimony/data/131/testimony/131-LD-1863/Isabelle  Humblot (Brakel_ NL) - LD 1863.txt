LD 1863
Dear Representative Sachs and Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee,
I support LD 1863 because this bill is incredibly important from a humanitarian 
perspective and virtually nonexistent nationwide.
LD 1863 would benefit all sick and elderly residents.
Some residents have health issues that are incompatible with detention. Long-term 
care provided by MDOC is inadequate and does not meet the needs.
I deplore the persistence of keeping patients in prison under the belief that the quality 
of care provided is the same as in a regular healthcare facility. There is a major 
inequality in access to care, whether one is incarcerated or free. No correctional 
facility is or should be a substitute for a healthcare facility.
Thank you for your time,
Sincerely,
Isabelle Humblot
