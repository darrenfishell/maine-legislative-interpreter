Testimony of Representative Melanie Sachs, sponsor of 
LD 1863, An Act to Facilitate the Provision of Medically Appropriate Levels of Care for 
Clients of Correctional Facilities 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and esteemed members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety My name is Melanie Sachs and I am honored represent the community of Freeport in the Maine Legislature I am before you today as the 
sponsor of LD 1863, An Act to Facilitate the Provision of Medically Appropriate Levels of Care for Clients of Correctional Facilities. 
I am a licensed climcal social worker with over two decades of expenence in healthcare, policy and community-based services This includes my work as a homecare and hospice supervisor for ﬁve rural counties in Northem and Dovvneast Maine I have also provided palliative care services 
as a hospital social worker and have extensive expenence with both dementia screenings and nursing home placements that required clinical level of care assessments 
On March 2, 2022, I attended a seminar sponsored by the Co-Occurring Collaborative Serving 
Maine (CCSME) entitled “Health, Healthcare, and Aging in Prison” which featured staff from Maine’s Department of Corrections detailing the growing issues and challenges of Maine’s aging correctional resident population 
Aging in prison has been the Sl.1l)_]6ClZ of extensive study in recent years Adults age 55 years 
(often called “prison boomers”) and older grew from 3% to 10% of the total state prison 
population between 1993 and 2013, representing a 400% increase in number, while the median age of incarcerated adults grew from 30 to 36 years old It is increasingly costly for correctional 
systems to respond to the needs of their older populations, including their need for medical and mental health care 
A study funded by the National Institute of Health and published in the International Journal of Prison Health, noted “These increased medical risks (associated with aging) are often 
particularly difﬁcult to manage in the prison setting They often go undetected and 
undertreated in correctional facilities, or may be unnecessarily exacerbated by conditions of conﬁnement like shackling for transport or long-term isolation Incarcerated elders have

L0u1s1ana's costs est1mated a ﬁvefold 1ncrease from $20,000/mmate/year to over $100,000 per 
year 1n 2012 Usmg the cost per lmnate prov1ded by Ma1ne’s DOC 1n heanngs last sess1on, the 
cost to marntam ag1ng mmates would be $148,000/year or 1f mult1pl1ed by ﬁve $3 70,000/year 
By contrast, the ave1 age cost of nursmg care 1n Mame 1s $5,865/month ($70,380 for asslsted

But, we have an alternatlve The MDOC pohcy 27 2, on Supervlsed Commun1ty Conﬁnement 
was Just rev1sed 1n January 2022 and contalned many pos1t1ve reportmg and not1ﬁcat1on changes, 
part1cular1y around those el1g1ble for early release Procedure N 1n th1s pol1cy, Superv1sed 
Communlty Conﬁnement for a Termmally Ill or Severely Incapac1tated Resldent, was not part of 
these mod1ﬁcat1ons Th1s sect1on allows for the conﬁnement of term1na1ly 111 1nmates or mmates 
w1th a severely 1ncapac1tat1ng medlcal cond1t1on 1n apommtmrty settrng l1ke a nursmg home or 
long-term care fac1l1ty or a prrvate home, at the d1scret1on of the Commlssloner or Med1cal 
D1rector Whrle th1s prov1s1on was wldely used 1n the past, 1t has rarely been used 1n the last four 
years, even though agmg 1s strongly correlated w1th deslstance from cr1m1nal behavlor as seen 1n 
MDOC’s rec1d1v1sm rates by age Th1s b1ll proposes statutory changes to T1tle 34-A to glve clear 
d1rect1on to help gulde pol1cy and ut1l1zat1on for th1s sect1on uslng best practlces 
This b1ll proposes to: 
A D1rect the comm1ss1oner to develop procedures to prov1de mformatron to staff, cl1ents and 
cl1ents' fnends and famlly regardlng serv1ces avallable under th1s subsect1on, 1nclud1ng, but not 
l1m1ted to, ass1sted l1v1ng, nursmg care, l'lOSp1CC and home health care servlces New systems are 
be1ng developed to help resrdents become aware of the1r el1g1b1l1ty for early release Th1s b1ll 
strengthens commun1cat1on to resldents, famllles and staff about th1s opt1on 
B Requrre ut1l1zat1on of the ob] ect1ve standard used by Ma1neCare and llC61'1S6d long term care 
fac1l1t1es, both here 1n Mame and nat1onally, to detenn1ne whether a person qual1ﬁes for long 
term care Currently, medlcal necesslty 1s detenmned only by the Department ’s D1rector of 
Medlcal Care LD 1863 requlres that resldents have the standard Long-term Care Adv1so1y 
Assessment Wl‘llCl’1 all Mame people need 1n order to assess cl1n1cal el1g1b1l1ty for nurs1ng home 
placement The assessment cl1n1cally determmes “1f the person 1s el1g1ble for poss1ble fac1l1ty 
ad1n1ss1on, or 1n-home serv1ces funded through Ma1neCare or state ﬁlnded home-based care 
programs Ind1v1duals ch0os1ng to enter a nursmg fac1l1ty must have th1s type of assessment to 
comply w1th the State statutes unless enterlng under skllled care ” Every res1dent and/or the1r 
famlly member should have the ablhty to request the requ1red Long-term Care Adv1sory 
Assessment to detennlne cl1n1cal el1g1b1l1ty 
C Requlre that 1f th1s cl1n1cal necesslty 1s met, the comm1ss1oner shall ensure that each cl1ent 
rece1ves the servlces determlned to be needed and 1s placed 1n a fac1l1ty appropnate for the level

of care requ1red w1tl11n 30 workmg days of a request Th1s can mean transfer w1th1n the 
correctlonal fac1l1ty or 1n the commumty, but the fac1l1ty should be hcensed to meet that level of 
care Volunteers prov1d1ng supportlve care and v1s1tat1on1s not true hosp1ce care, for example,l

level of care 
D Requlre the Department to collect data and report weekly on the number of cllents usmg 
servlces under tlns subsectlon 1nclud1ng applrcatrons for med1cal evaluatlons and app11cat1ons for 
placement, acceptance or demal for serv1ces, type and ntunber of placements, and assoclated 
demographrc data, 1nclud1ng, but not l1m1ted to race, gender and age The data must be 
annuahzed and must be lncluded 1n the department's full amaual report to the Leglslature Th1s 
data requlrement would not only‘ allgn Wlth many of the stat1st1cs already gathered by the 
Department, but also provlde evldence to what the Department has acknowledged 1s a growmg 
trend of agmg 1mnates 
There can be sav1ngs to the state to facllltate the appropnate level of care for resrdents, asI 
1nd1cated earller Nursmg home care 1s covered by Ma1neCare (see Ma1neCare Beneﬁts Manual 
10-144 C M R ch 101) That same care provrded 1n a MDOC fac1l1ty 1s not covered by 
Ma1neCare The Department and state would reduce transport costs Older resldents or those 
w1th s1gn1ﬁcantmed1ca1 condrtrons requ1re transport to med1cal appo1ntments outs1de the fac1l1ty 
for speclallzed care lncludmg cancer treatment, d1alys1s, surgery, cardrac and endocrlne 
problems, etc Each transport also means at least two ofﬁcers must accompany the lmnate, 
slgnlﬁcantly contnbutlng to staff shortages and overtrme costs Under th1s pol1cy, the pat1ent 
remams 1n the custody of the Mame Department of Correctlons and can be returned to p1‘1S011 
e1ther at the request of the healthcare fac1l1ty or the Department of Correctlons 
I ask you to support LD 1863 as a means of support1ng both the Department and the resrdents 
who quahfy for release under DOC gu1del1nes by provrdmg the chmcally mdlcated level of care 
and access to essentral sen/1ces, whlle more efﬁclently ut1l1Z1ng state resources Thank you for
