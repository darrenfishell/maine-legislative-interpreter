LD 1863
Dear Esteemed members of the Committee,
I write to support LD 1863. There is absolutely no reason to keep elderly, geriatric 
people incarcerated at the end of their lives. It is inhumane, wildly expensive, and 
serves no public safety purpose. We have to begin to bring a clear-eyed view of what 
prisons are for, who should be in them, and when they have accomplished what they 
are supposed to accomplish, which is incapacitation and corrections/rehabilitation. 
There is no public good in keeping elderly people at the end of their lives in prison at 
enormous public expense when their medical costs can be covered by MaineCare in 
their family homes or in nursing homes that are qualified to provide eldercare. Please 
be sensible and vote to pass this bill.
