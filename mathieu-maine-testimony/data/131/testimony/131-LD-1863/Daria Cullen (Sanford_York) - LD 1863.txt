I’m writing in support of LD 1863 An Act To Provide Licensed Assisted Living and 
Nursing Facilities Levels of Care for Incarcerated Persons because the alternative is 
inhumane. Prisons are not equipped, licensed or designed to effectively treat 
incarcerated people who are terminally ill.
There’s also the substantial costs involved in regular transports for ongoing treatments
when there are no cost options available right now such as release to family or nursing
homes where they can receive appropriate medical care all covered by MaineCare.
Additionally, the Supervised Community Confinement Program (SCCP) has a 
provision in place which allows for this type of release into the community but it’s 
underutilized forcing someone who may not even have a life sentence to live out their 
last days or years in a dehumanizing setting without family or loved ones able to visit.
It’s a death sentence by proxy and should not be allowed to continue.
A more compassionate approach is possible without risk to public safety while also 
reducing healthcare costs. For these reasons I ask you to please vote ought to pass.
Thank you.
