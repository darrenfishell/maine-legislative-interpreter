Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1764:
“An
Act
Regarding
the
Charge
for
Research
Time
by
State
Agencies,for
Freedom
of
Access
Act
Requests”
Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1764
.
It
is
a
bill
that
would
move
the
state
away
from
the
admittedly
low
current
standards
required
of
state
agencies
to
fulfill
FOAA
requests
in
a
timely
manner,
consistent
with
the
public’s
right
to
know.
LD
1764
would
scrap
the
current
policy
of
the
state
offering
the
first
two
hours
to
fulfill
a
FOAA
request
free
as
a
courtesy
to
the
public,
allowing
a
state
agency
or
official
to
charge
for
the
first
two
hours
of
staff
time.
The
bill
also
sets
the
fee
for
the
third
hour
and
beyond
at
exactly
$25
per
hour
for
staff
time,
removing
the
ability
agency
officials
have
today
to
charge
less.
Please
deem
LD
1764
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
reject
this
attempt
to
raise
the
barrier
for
Maine
people
to
access
their
government.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
