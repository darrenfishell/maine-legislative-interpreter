Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association 
In Support of 
LD 1764 - An Act Regarding the Charge for Research Time by State Agencies for Freedom of Access Act Requests 
May 12, 2023 
Sen Carney, Rep Moonen and members iOfthE.|UdlClal'Y Committee, my name IS Rebecca Lambert, 
and I am providing testimony in support of LD 17i64 on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association's (MMA) 
elected 70-member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC) For reference, the LPC provides direction to the 
advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest 
Municipal officials take responding to Freedom of Access (FOAA) requests very seriously and as 
such, it sparked conversation both for and against this legislation among our LPC members Although 
municipalities appreciate the intent to allow for the costs for fulfilling such requests to be recouped, there 
is an equal amount of concern that it IS the duty of a municipalities to provide the requested information 
to the public and should not come with a cost, unless the request is unduly burdensome ortime consuming 
to ﬁll 
Local leaders maintain the desire to provide cost effective services that benefit the public good 
and are steadfast in their dedication to providing accurate information and record keeping for posterity 
However, with the LPC presenting a split discussion viewpoint on the proposal in LD 1764, municipal 
leaders ultimately decided to support the measure in an effort to assist the smaller towns in Maine whose 
budgets are extremely tight and are affected more by fulfilling these types of requests 
Thank you for your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue I would be 
happy to answer any questions you may have
