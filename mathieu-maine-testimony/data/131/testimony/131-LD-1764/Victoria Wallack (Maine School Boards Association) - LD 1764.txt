TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
‘LFllE. li*§lL“7-64$ 
AN ACT REGARDING THE CHARGE FOR RESEARCH TIME BY STATE 
AGENCIES FOR FREEDOM OF ACCESS ACT REQUESTS 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and members of the Commrttee on Jud1c1ary, I am V1ctor1a Wallack, 
d1rector of commumcauons and government relatlons for Mame School Management Assoc1at1on, test1fymg 
on behalf of the leg1slat1ve commlttees of the Mame School Boards Assoc1at1on and Ma1ne School 
Supenntendents Assoc1at1on, 1n support of L D 1764 
We support th1s b1ll because 1t recognlzes there 1s a cost to ﬁllﬁllmg freedom of access requests and that cost 
has grown wlth the prol1ferat1on of requests made to school d1str1cts One strategy employed m these requests 
1s to break them up 1nto smaller 1ncrements not to exceed two hours, so there 1s no cost to the requestor to 
offset the cost of fulﬁlhng these requests 
The staff 1n our d1str1cts, who have to fulﬁll these requests, are takmg tune away from the1r other 
respons1b1l1t1es, but that work has to be done 
Our recommendatlon 1s to expl1c1tly lnclude school adm1n1strat1ve d1str1cts 1n th1s proposal because as wntten we are not rncluded 1n the deﬁn1t1on of agency, under T1tle 5, §8002 
It reads 
"Agency" means any body of State Govemment authonzed by law to adopt rules, to 1ssue l1censes or to take 
ﬁnal actlon 1n ad_1ud1cato1y proceedmgs, 1nclud1ng, but not l1m1ted to, every authonty, board, bureau, 
com1n1ss1on, department or ofﬁcer of the State Govemment so authonzed, but the term does not 1nclude the 
Leg1slature, Governor, courts, Un1vers1ty of Mame System, Ma1ne Mar1t1me Academy, commun1ty colleges, 
the Comm1ss1oner of Educat1on for schools of the tmorgamzed terntory, school ad1n1n1strat1ve umts, 
communlty actlon agenc1es as deﬁned 1n T1tle 22 sectlon 5321, spec1al purpose d1str1cts or mun1c1pal1t1es, 
count1es or other pol1t1cal subd1v1s1ons of the State
