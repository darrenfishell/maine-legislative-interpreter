Sen Carney, Rep Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is 
Judith Meyer I am the editor of the Sun Journal in Lewiston, the Kennebec Journal and the 
Morning Sentinel 
l write on behalf of the Maine Press Association in opposition to LD 1764, An Act Regarding the 
Charge for Research Time by State Agencies for Freedom of Access Act Requests 
*** 
During the last legislative session, at the recommendation of the Right to Know Advisory 
Committee, the Legislature raised the rate that an agency or official may charge to cover the 
cost of searching for, retrieving and compiling a public record from $15 to $25 per hour 
Lawmakers also increased the amount of ”free" staff research time from one hour to two 
As we testified regarding LD 1649, "An Act to Support Local Governments in Responding to 
Freedom of Access Act Requests," the move to raise the hourly fee was made to more 
accurately reflect the cost of public records searches and came following a months-long survey 
conducted by the Maine Municipal Association of its members seeking guidance on the issue of 
the research time and hourly rate, with clerks and town managers agreeing the $25 per hour 
cost was sufficient 
That higher hourly ﬁgure - which was supported by representatives of the Maine School 
Management Association, police agencies and representatives of state government who sen/e 
on the Right to Know Advisory Committee -- has been in effect for a little more than a year 
As part of the Right to Know Advisory Committee's discussion on fees, members considered 
what the hourly increase might mean for the general public, and -— at the suggestion of MMA 
and others — increased the "free" staff research time allowed under FOAA from one hour to 
two hours 
Here's the thinking 
Most routine FOAA requests take less than three hours to fulfill 
Under the former costs — one free hour and S15 per hour — a response that took three hours to 
process would have cost $30
Under the current costs — two free hours and $25 per hour — a response that took three hours 
to process will cost $25 
Four hours under the former costs would have been $45, four hours under the new fee is $50 
Five hours under the former costs would have been $60, ﬁve hours under the new fee is $75 
And on, and on 
You can see that the fees ramp up much faster for larger requests under the current fee 
structure than they had previously, while also allowing more routine requests to fall under 
more reasonable costs This was intentional to ensure that the larger the FOAA request, the 
more a requestor could be expected to pay for staff time to research and compile 
Adding the extra ”free" research hour while also raising the hourly fee was the result of 
thoughtful input from dozens of public employees, many of whom process FOAA requests, and 
best reflects a fair and workable compromise between staff and requestors 
For these reasons, MPA opposes adding a $25 fee for the ﬁrst two hours of staff research time 
under FOAA
