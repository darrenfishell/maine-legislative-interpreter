Senator
Rotundo,
Representative
Sachs,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Appropriations
and
Financial
Af fairs
Committee,
my
name
is
Jef f
Candura,
I
use
he/him
pronouns,
and
I
am
the
Development
Director
for
the
MSSM
Foundation,
a
501(c)3
set
up
alongside
the
Maine
School
of
Science
and
Mathematics
with
the
goal
of
supporting
the
school,
and
its
faculty ,
staf f,
and
students.
I
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
Board
of
the
MSSM
Foundation
–
made
up
of
MSSM
alumni,
parents,
and
friends
–
to
urge
your
support
for
LD749.
The
statute
that
established
MSSM
allows
for
a
scholarship
and
educational
enhancement
fund
–
the
MSSM
Foundation.
The
statute
also
clearly
states
that
those
private
funds
raised
“may
not
be
used
to
of fset,
reduce
or
eliminate
the
appropriation
of
state
funds”
and
“may
not
reduce
or
eliminate
the
State's
funding
obligations.”
Support
for
MSSM
from
donors
has
been
strong
and
continues
to
increase
as
alumni
age
and
become
more
established
in
their
careers.
In
the
last
school
year
alone,
the
MSSM
Foundation
has
transferred
almost
$100,000
in
private
donations
to
the
school
for
purposes
including:
professional
development
for
faculty
and
staf f,
the
purchase
of
new
classroom
equipment,
student
travel
to
competitions,
the
establishment
of
a
summer
bridge
program
for
incoming
students,
the
development
of
an
updated
website,
physical
improvements
to
the
dorm,
and
student
financial
aid.
W e
expect
to
transfer
a
greater
amount
of
funds
in
the
next
school
year .
The
need
for
private
donations
is
growing
at
MSSM,
and
we
at
the
Foundation
are
more
than
happy
to
work
to
fill
that
need.
Based
on
my
20
years
of
experience,
the
ceiling
for
MSSM’ s
fundraising
potential
is
high.
W e
know
that
there
are
donors
who
would
contribute
to
an
ef fort
to
renovate
facilities.
W e
often
hear
from
alumni
and
donors
that
they
would
like
to
contribute
to
outdated
chemistry
labs,
or
improvements
to
the
dorm,
or
updated
academic
spaces.
But
in
the
next
breath,
they
lament
the
lack
of
investment
in
these
spaces
from
the
state
of
Maine.
In
order
for
the
MSSM
Foundation
to
work
with
private
donors
on
areas
of
need,
those
donors
need
to
see
evidence
that
the
primary
stakeholder
in
the
school,
the
state
of
Maine,
believes
that
it
should
thrive.
Right
now ,
our
donors
do
not
see
that
commitment.
Increasingly ,
our
work
is
blurring
the
line
between
enhancing
the
academic
experience
and
“reducing
the
State’ s
funding
obligations.”
For
example,
we
are
currently
working
with
a
donor
to
fund
a
new
fume
hood
for
our
chemistry
lab.
I
struggle
to
imagine
any
other
public
school
needing
to
rely
on
private
donations
for
such
a
fundamental
piece
of
capital.
There
is
only
so
much
that
philanthropy
can
do
–
the
State
must
take
the
lead.
School
districts
around
Maine
are
currently
submitting
budgets
to
their
cities
and
towns
–
most
of
them
with
large
increases.
Here
are
some
of
the
increases
according
to
news
reports:
MSAD75
-
6.5%;
W estbrook
9.6%;
RSU1
-
3.6%;
SAD51
-
7%;
Camden
Hills
Regional
High
School
-
17.26%;
SAD44
-
10.39%.
I
could
go
on.
Again,
this
is
just
a
single
year ’ s
increase
–
MSSM
has
not
seen
an
increase
in
state
subsidy
in
five
years.
MSSM
has
no
municipality
it
can
go
to
to
request
additional
funds.
It
is
up
to
the
State
to
support
MSSM.
The
first
things
to
be
cut
when
budgets
are
tight
is
deferred
maintenance
and
capital
improvements.
Y ear
after
year
of
flat
funding
has
taken
its
toll
on
MSSM’ s
physical
plant.
A
bill,
LD1458,
which
hopefully
to
this
committee
soon,
would
bring
MSSM’ s
funding
to
a
reasonable
level.
That
funding
increase,
in
combination
with
this
bond,
would
allow
MSSM
to
start
bringing
its
physical
plant
up
to
snuf f,
and
would
help
to
unlock
a
significant
amount
of
private
fundraising
to
support
MSSM
and
help
keep
MSSM
sustainable
for
another
generation
of
Maine
students.
Even
with
these
headwinds,
MSSM
has
remained
a
top
performing
school
and
an
economic
engine
for
the
state
of
Maine.
While
MSSM
graduates
routinely
attend
top
ranked
colleges
and
universities
around
the
country ,
33%
of
college
bound
graduates
in
the
last
five
years
stayed
in
state
for
higher
education,
with
the
#1
school
for
applications,
acceptances,
and
attendances
being
the
University
of
Maine
at
Orono.
MSSM
is
Maine’ s
High
School.
W e
need
to
support
it
and
its
capital
plant
as
such.
I
have
spent
most
of
my
career
in
educational
fundraising.
I
have
done
so
because
I
believe
that
education
is
the
greatest
social
mobilizer
available
to
us.
If
we
have
any
chance
of
solving
the
problems
of
the
future,
we
need
to
start
by
providing
those
who
will
shape
the
future
a
strong
education
now .
Many
of
the
future
leaders
of
our
state
are
in
Limestone
at
MSSM.
On
behalf
of
the
MSSM
Foundation
Board
of
Directors,
I
strongly
urge
you
to
move
LD749
forward.
Thank
you.
