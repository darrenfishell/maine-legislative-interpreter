David Martin
MSSM Facilities Director

Hi,
My name is David Martin, I am the director of facilities at the Maine School of 
Science & Mathematics. I just wanted to share some of my concerns we have here at 
our facilities. One Of the major concerns is the age of the roof at the dorm, being 
almost 30 years old it is well past its life expectancy. I recently received a quote of 
close to 300,000 dollars for the replacement of the roof. Unfortunately the longer it 
goes without being replaced the more extensive the job which means more expense 
also. Another big concern is the boiler system, the current boilers were installed in 
1984. The life expectancy of a system like this averages 30 years. Being almost 40 
years old this is a concern. The estimate we received to upgrade the boiler system was
just over 1,000,000 dollars. This does not include the outdated HVAC system which 
would add another 400,000 dollars to the heating system. I have been in contact with 
the efficiency office trying to find more efficient options but this still takes much 
needed funding.  We would hate to end up in a situation like our adjoining school 
LCS where their boiler was condemned leaving them to ask the taxpayers at the last 
minute to fund a million plus dollar project. Which is an option we do not have. 
Thank you for your time.
Mr.David Martin
