 Testimony of Senator Jill Duson supporting LD 1239, “An Act to Make General Election Day a 
State Holiday and to AllowCertain Employees an Opportunity to Vote” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government 
April 21, 2023 
 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and Distinguished Colleagues on the Joint Standing 
Committee on State and Local Government, my name is Jill Duson. I represent Senate District 
27, which includes parts of Westbrook and Portland. I am here to speak in favor of LD 1239, 
“An Act to Make General Election Day a State Holiday and to Allow Certain Employees an 
Opportunity to Vote.” 
 
Every two years in this state on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, Mainers line up 
at the polls to vote at every level of government, as it applies. Every one of those years, there are 
lines outside polling locations in densely populated municipalities, and every one of those years, 
there are those who decide to not vote at all because they can’t find the time in the day. 
 
There are several barriers of entry for voting, and one of those is that Election Day always takes 
place on a Tuesday, which for many is day when voters are unavailable because of their jobs. 
While this bill proposes to remove this barrier for state employees only, it is an important step 
forward to ensure every Mainer’s inalienable right to vote is not infringed upon.  
 
Currently in the United States, the rights of many voters are under attack. We are living in a 
frightening time when our sacred democracy is undergoing the process of backsliding. In Maine, 
we are holding out and maintaining the integrity of our state’s democracy. This legislation would 
only strengthen our democracy. Our forefathers, mothers, and parents fought for the rights that 
we all hold today. Let’s continue their work by voting “Ought to Pass” on LD 1239.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.
