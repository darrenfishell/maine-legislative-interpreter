TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1239  
 
AN ACT TO MAKE GENERAL ELECTION DAY A STATE HOLIDAY AND TO  
ALLOW CERTAIN EMPLOYEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE  
 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the State and Local Government Committee. I am  
Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association , in opposition to L.D. 1239.  
 
Our associations are opposed to this bill beca use we believe school attendance is critically important and 
declaring Election Day a state holiday would close public schools. We believe that  sends the wrong message 
about the importance of public education  and the role it plays in a democracy.  
 
This pro posal also could put parents at a disadvantage in terms of exercising their right to vote  at the polls , if 
they donâ€™t have childcare for that day.  
 
We also are concerned that this is a mandate requiring employers provide an employee with three consecutive 
hours in which to vote on Election Day. That could affect  all our staff, including those in the central office.  
 
The reality is m any communities have flexible hours to accommodate working parents  and their work 
schedules . The state also allows all eligible v oters to send in  an absentee ballot.  
 
This bill is not needed because there are ways our staff can vote outside of school hours and closing school on 
Election Day is not in the best interest of our students.
