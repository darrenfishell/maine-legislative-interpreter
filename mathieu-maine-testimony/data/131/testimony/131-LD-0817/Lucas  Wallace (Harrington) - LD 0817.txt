My name is Lucas Wallace. I live in Washington County, Maine. I have been commercially 
fishing elvers for 30 years in Maine. Elver fisherman in Maine are a very old group of people. 
They are an old group because this fishery has a moratorium on the number of licenses. Now
when a fisherman gets a new license it's through the lottery system, after a fisherman does 
not renew their license; usually from death or not being able to physically empty out their tail 
bag every night. I think elver fisherman should be allowed the same rights and allowances of 
all other commercial fishing crews working on Maine waters. These fisherman still have 
mortgages, bills, and families. We should not be forcing our aging fisherman out of the 
business on a technicality, like emptying their tail bag. We should allow them to use their 
crew. Just like every other fishery in the state. Could you imagine if a lobster fisherman had 
these same rules? The lobsterman with the license would have to hire a captain to drive the 
boat, so that they could reach in the trap to retrieve the lobsters, themself. A commercial 
lobster fisherman with a crew license just has to be on board and his crew is allowed to do 
any job that needs to be done. Most of the time and in most areas it's reasonably safe to fish. 
Some areas are extremely dangerous. Maine weather in March and April at night can be 
extremely dangerous. Some nights it's raining and blowing 50 MPH. Other nights it's cold and
as the tide drops, all the rocks are frozen. It's like walking on frozen glass bottles. Very 
dangerous. It's these nights when an older fisherman with a crew license could use the help 
and should be allowed. Thank You for Your Consideration.  -Lucas Wallace
