Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, Honorable Members of the Marine Resource 
Committee:
My name is Virginia Olsen, I am a commercial lobsterman from Stonington and the Director 
of the Maine Lobstering Union.  
The MLU is testifying ought not to pass on LD 810 An Act to Create a Restricted Senior 
Lobster and Crab Fishing License.  
While the idea of a senior license with reduced gear was appealing to the MLU it was the 
creation of a new license that was the heart of the problem in this current regulatory 
turmoil we are in.  It is true that aging fishermen as our bodies stop working the way they 
should hold onto their license as an identity more than a source of income, if we could find 
a way to implement this with those fishermen that still do hold their license we would feel 
differently.
Thank you,
Virginia Olsen
