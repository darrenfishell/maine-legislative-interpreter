Dear Honored members of the Maine State Legislature - 
I am an independent voter who votes democratic because of my desire to continue to 
protect our environment and medical rights of all kinds., including abortion rights.  
I have been very disappointed in the democratic party in Maine in recent years.
Because of my medical foreign aid work - I am personally heavily vaccinated.
I am writing to you regarding the Vaccine Mandates of 2019 and the bills currently in 
front of you to change those mandates.   
I urge you to strike down these mandates.  People deserve the right to choose. I had 
the right to choose, and I made my own choices.  
Look to Scandinavia for success medically - Look at what we just experienced.
COVID doesn't affect children and the COVID vaccine does not stop transmission.  
The vaccine is medically irrelevant for most children.  Doctors can make these 
decisions with patients in offices.  You don't need to make this decision in the halls of
tlegislature.
As you may or may not be aware - Ronald Regan pushed the vaccine agenda hard in 
his term and it was the democrats (think Woodstock) who were the anxti-vaxx 
movement of the 60s, 70s, and 80s.   
Oh, the times they are a changin.  
Vaccines come with inherent risk.  
Vaccines are not 100% effective.  
Vaccines are a cash cow for the drug companies. 
Vaccine Manufactures have no liability.  
About half of the US Population refused the COVID Vaccine but the pandemic went 
away??  Did you notice that?
I personally did my homework - Please do yours are allow people to make their own 
choices.  
New Hampshire has its freedom, and you share an open boarder.  Nothing indicates 
that this has been harmful to Maine these many, many years.
Don't be a stooge to the Drug Companies.  
Take your vitamins, long walks on the beach and eat good food.  That's also a choice.
