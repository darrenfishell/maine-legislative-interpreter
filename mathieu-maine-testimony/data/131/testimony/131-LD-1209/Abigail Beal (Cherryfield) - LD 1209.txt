LD 1209, An Act to Reinstate the Religious and Philosophical Vaccine
Exemptions for Private Schools and Virtual Public Charter Schools
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Abigail Beal of Cherryfield.  I urge you to support LD 1209's reinstating of religious and 
philosophical vaccine exemptions for private and virtual public charter schools.
Parents should be the ones to decide which vaccines their children will or will not receive, not the 
government.  
If parents have reservations about or convictions regarding the use of any vaccine, they have the God-
given right to protect their children's health and safety and refuse that injection without being deprived 
of liberties and rights that other citizens enjoy. God gave children to parents, not to the government.   
It is for this reason that I ask you to support LD 1209.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
