This change in our legislation has immensely impacted our lives.  My two kids 8 and 
15 are now my responsibility to educate which has impacted not only our financial 
situation but my children can no longer have an equal opportunity to form peer 
groups, or an opportunity of creating meaningful relationships with peers and 
teachers…and then college! 
And on top of all this my youngest has an autoimmune disease ‘ CVS’ cyclical 
vomiting syndrome where unknown triggers or allergens can set off a seventy-two 
hour vomiting episode that takes three days to recover from. We don’t know all the 
triggers and I’m not willing to try to vaccinate and “wait and see”. But the way the 
medical exemption is written she would have to have almost died from taking the 
vaccine before she’d qualify.  This is not a chance or choice that I want to risk.  We 
should be able to have the freedom to choose what goes into our bodies.  And every 
child should have an equal opportunity to education! 
This situation has marginalized my children and family and people should be aware of
how this is affecting people like us.
