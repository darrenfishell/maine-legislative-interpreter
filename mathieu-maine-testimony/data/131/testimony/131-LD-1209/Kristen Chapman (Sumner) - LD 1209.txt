LD 1209
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Committee of 
Education and Cultural Affairs,
I am writing IN SUPPORT of LD 51, LD 869, LD 1098, LD 1148, LD 1209, and LD 
1228. 
It is CLEAR that philosophical and religious vaccine exemptions ARE 
NECESSARY, as observed by the Superintendent of Lewiston schools NOT 
enforcing the passage of LD 798, thus allowing students to remain enrolled regardless
of vaccine status (as reported in the Sun Journal on February 9, 2023). What is 
UNCLEAR to me is how this is allowable, as it discriminates against all other similar 
students in Maine who have been removed from school, as well as healthcare 
workers, daycare providers and college students who were required to leave their jobs
and/or schooling. Much debate surrounds the use of vaccines. Risk DOES come with 
immunization, particularly so with those authorized under emergency use; exemptions
MUST be in place to honor personal choice, religious and medical freedom, and must 
NOT violate both the United States and State of Maine Constitutional rights. 
Additionally, I question how the Maine Human Rights Act and current Maine vaccine
law can coexist without conflict; perhaps THIS is why the vaccine status of students 
in Lewiston schools has gone ignored?
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS the above-listed legislative documents.
