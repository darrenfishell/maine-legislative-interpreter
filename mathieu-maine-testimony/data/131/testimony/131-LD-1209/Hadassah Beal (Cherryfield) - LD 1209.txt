Testimony of Hadassah P . Beal
Testimony in Support of LD 1209
An Act to Reinstate the Religious and Philosophical Vaccine
Exemptions for Private Schools and Virtual Public Charter Schools 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Hadassah Beal of Cherryfield, Maine, and I am 
writing in support of LD 1209, An Act to Reinstate the Religious and Philosophical Vaccine
Exemptions for Private Schools and Virtual Public Charter Schools . Every individual should have 
the right to reject any sort of medical procedure that they do not believe is necessary, and that 
they may have religious or philosophical reasons for not taking part in. For the Maine 
government to decide that every student must have a certain list of vaccinations, despite their 
beliefs, is overstepping their given power, and is trampling on the freedoms of Mainers. It is time 
for LD 798 of 2019 to be rolled back, and I ask you to please vote in favor of this bill.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Hadassah P . Beal
