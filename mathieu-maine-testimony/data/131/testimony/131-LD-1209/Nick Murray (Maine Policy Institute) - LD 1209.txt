Senator
Rafferty,
Representative
Brennan,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Affairs,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
51,
LD
1098,
and
LD
1209.
Many
young
families
in
Maine
were
placed
under
undue
financial
and
emotional
hardship
after
this
law
was
changed
to
remove
religious
and
philosophical
exemptions
to
the
state
immunization
schedule
in
2020.
It
unfairly
singled
out
a
class
of
parents
who
simply
exercised
their
right
of
conscience
to
raise
their
children
the
way
they
prefer.
Is
Maine
a
state
that
tells
parents,
“our
way
or
the
highway?”
These
bills
are
necessary
to
right
a
wrong
and
restore
proper
respect
to
the
individual
rights
of
Maine
people
—
to
their
bodily
autonomy.
They
would
allow
religious
and
philosophical
exemptions
to
state
immunization
mandates
for
children
to
attend
school,
or
for
adults
to
work
in
a
healthcare
facility
or
a
nursery
school.
Simply
stated,
the
public
health
rationale
for
mandatory
vaccination
does
not
meet
the
high
standard
to
violate
liberty
promised
to
every
individual
by
the
United
States
and
Maine
Constitutions.
The
state
has
no
business
dictating
the
choices
of
parents,
whether
in
education,
health,
or
any
other
arena.
Government
exists
to
protect
individual
rights,
not
to
run
individuals’
lives
or
immune
systems.
Please
deem
LD
51,
LD
1098,
and
LD
1209
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
restore
respect
for
bodily
autonomy
in
Maine
law.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
