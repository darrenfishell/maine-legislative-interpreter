 Testimony of the Maine Association of School Nurses in Opposition of 
 LD 1209 “An Act to Reinstate the Religious and Philosophical Vaccine 
 Exemptions for Private Schools and Virtual Public Charter Schools”.

 President, Maine Association of School Nurses

 Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan and distinguished members of 
 the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee:  My name is Angie Buker and I 
 am president of the Maine Association of School Nurses (MASN) and a 
 member of the National Association of School Nurses. MASN represents 
 more than half of Maine’s Pre K-12 school nurses.  Our mission is to optimize 
 student health and learning by advancing the practice of school nursing. 
 MASN has reviewed the above proposed legislation and has concluded that 
 we cannot support LD 1209 “An Act to Reinstate the Religious and 
 Philosophical Vaccine Exemptions for Private Schools and Virtual Charter 
 Schools”. 
 It is the position of the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) that 
 immunizations are essential to primary prevention of disease from infancy 
 through adulthood. MASN believes that this evidence-based practice is in the 
 best interest of all Maine students in all education settings.  According to the 
 CDC (2011), the impact of vaccines in reducing and eliminating 
 vaccine-preventable diseases has been one of the 10 great public health 
 achievements in the United States. 
 It is a disservice to our children, and our public health to exempt private 
 school and virtual public charter school students from immunization 
 requirements. This just transfers the problem to a different venue and 
 maintains the low vaccine areas in certain counties. Unimmunized individuals 
 are still a risk to infants, the elderly and the immuno-compromised in the 
 community at large. 
 We ask you to please consider these reasons,  maintain Maine’s strong 
 vaccination law  and not move the problem to different  sectors. MASN urges 
 the committee to vote  Ought Not to Pass on LD 1209.  Thank you for 
 listening to the concerns of MASN as we strive to keep our students healthy 
 and in the classroom as well as support parents making the best healthcare 
 decisions for their children.
