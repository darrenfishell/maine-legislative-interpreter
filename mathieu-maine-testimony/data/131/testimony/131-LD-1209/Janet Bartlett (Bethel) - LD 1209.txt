Thank you for taking my testimony. As I listen to all the proceedings today, I hold out
hope that you will choose right and vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 51 to reinstate 
philosophical and religious exemptions to regain access to education for all those who
have been dismissed. HOWEVER, if for some reason you do not come to this 
righteous conclusion, at the very least these children should not be excluded from 
online education on all levels and should also have the right to organize private 
education and to gather with teachers and peers in education and sports play. I thank 
you for your time and diligence on these very large yet basic human rights issues.
