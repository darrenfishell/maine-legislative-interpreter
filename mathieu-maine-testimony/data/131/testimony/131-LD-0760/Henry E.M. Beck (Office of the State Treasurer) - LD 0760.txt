Joint Standing Committee on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
Testimony in Support of LD 760, An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding Signature Requirements on 
Issuance of General Fund Bonds 
Honorable Chairs and Members:i 
We support the intent of LD 760: to limit the opportunity for only one actor to cause contradictory delays 
or cancellations of bond transactions. With this in mind, we share the following with the Committee: 
l) References to signatures on bonds contained within § l45 and 145-B of Title 5 concern the signing 
of documents that are executed at the ﬁnal stage of a transaction. In practice, by the time the Chief 
Executive or Treasurer is required to sign these speciﬁc documents, the bonds referenced in the 
document have been approved by the Legislature, ratiﬁed by Maine voters, listed in ofﬁcial 
offering statements, priced, and included in an executed bond purchase contract between 
underwriters and the Treasurer of State acting on behalf of the State. To the extent the Legislature 
intends to give a Chief Executive the discretion to stall, modify or cancel a sale, we believe such 
discretion should be exercised long before the signing described in § 145 and 145-B of Title 5. 
l. Notwithstanding § 145 and 145-B of Title 5, in practice, a Chief Executive can take steps within 
their authority that can prevent, modify or stall a bond sale. This would play out in the drafting of 
the ofﬁcial statement, the presentation of information to credit rating agencies and in the approval 
of financial orders during various phases of the bonding process-V

2. We have carefully reviewed the current unamended language in LD 760 with our outside bond 
counsel and our external municipal ﬁnancial advisor. Bond counsel advises that this narrow 
language poses no legal risks. We otherwise defer to the Ofﬁce of the Attorney General. Our 
municipal advisor has opined with conﬁdence that the narrow changes proposed in LD 760 have 
no negative market implications. 
Thank you for your time and attention. Please let us know if we can be of assistance. 
Sincerely,7
