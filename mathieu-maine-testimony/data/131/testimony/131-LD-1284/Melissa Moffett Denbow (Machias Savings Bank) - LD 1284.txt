I am writing in support of this legislation as I firmly believe this should be a 
requirement for all students.  As a long time volunteer in the class room for Junior 
Achievement and as a Jump$tart Coalition board member, I see first hand the impact 
these lessons have on students.  Unfortunately 1 hour classes over 5 weeks is just a 
small impact whereas a complete course on financial health would lay the foundation 
for strong financial skills for their future and the future of Maine.
