Jessica Graham
Waterville
LD 1284
My name is Jessica Graham.  I’m a social studies teacher from Waterville and am 
writing in opposition to LD 1284. The thoughts I’m sharing are my own and not 
intended to represent any school or organization I work for.
I have two primary arguments against this bill. First, it will potentially divert already 
limited instructional time in social studies to personal finance. Secondly, it provides 
no funding for teacher training in the subject.
While this bill is well intentioned, it will ultimately create educational deficits for 
children in districts with limited resources. The bill proposes to require that every 
high school offer a personal finance course as a social studies graduation requirement.
It does not increase the state minimum of two years of social studies instruction. 
Districts will be faced with two choices: increase their district requirements for social 
studies and hire additional staff, or further limit the already scant time devoted to 
history, civics, and geography in most Maine high schools. 
There have been many news reports in recent weeks indicating that, nationally,  8th 
graders are demonstrating the lowest civics and history scores since testing began. 
Social studies has been increasingly marginalized over the past 30 years. A recent 
study from the National Council for the Social Studies indicates that the average 
elementary school spends only 9% of instructional time on social studies. In Maine, 
high school students are  required by the state to take only two social studies courses. 
To take away additional time from history and civics is short sighted and will only 
further the decline of civic knowledge and skills for our students.
In addition, this bill comes with no funding for training social studies teachers for new
roles as personal finance teachers. Some organizations supporting this bill argue that 
access to pre-written curriculum is all that teachers will need. As an educator I 
disagree. Teachers should have expertise in the area they’re teaching. Failing to 
provide training for that expertise will lead to less than ideal educational experiences 
for students.
While personal finance is important, many schools already offer a course through 
their business or career preparation departments. It could also be a natural fit for a 
math department. If it must be included in social studies, the state must provide 
districts with funding for new social studies teaching positions, increase the social 
studies requirements for graduation, and provide funding for teacher training in 
personal finance content. I encourage the committee to reject this bill and advocates 
of personal finance education to look for solutions that do not further limit access for 
students to history and civics education. 
Thank you for the opportunity to share testimony.
