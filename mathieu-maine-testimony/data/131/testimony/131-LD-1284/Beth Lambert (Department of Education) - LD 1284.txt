LD 1284, An Act to Requrre Personal Fmance to be Taught as a Separate Course to Obtama 
Hrgh School Dlplomg, proposes that the hlgh school drploma 111SlIl1Ct1OI1 requlrement related to 
personal ﬁnance must be met through a stand-alone course 
The State dlploma requlrements reﬂect the mmnnum requrred by the State m order for a school 
admmrstratlve umt (SAU) to award a hlgh school drploma All SAUs have the ab1l1ty, through 
local pollcy, to add requ1rements to these mmrmums 
The Mame Learnmg Results currently requlre SAUs to prov1de mstructlon on ﬁnanc1al hteracy, 
however, specrﬁc courses remam a local dec1s1on Trtle 20-A, §4722 already requlres personal 
ﬁnance as part of the requ1red 2 years of soc1al studles Also mcluded 1n the 2 years 1s hrstory, 
government, and c1v1cs It seems dlsproportlonate to say that personal ﬁnance would have to bea 
standalone course 
As md1cated 1n T1tle 20-A, §2(2), the control and management of the pubhc schools shall be 
vested m the legrslatlve and govemmg bod1es of local school admlmstratrve un1ts, as long as 
those umts are 1n compl1ance w1th appropr1ate state statutes Thrs pol1cy of “local control” 
provldes CO1I11I1L1I11lI1CS w1th a stronger vo1ce 1n cr1t1cal dec1s1ons m how educatlon 1s to be 
provlded Schools choose to offer m the way that best meets thelr needs Many schools offera 
semor course that covers many toplcs, mclud1ng ﬁnanc1all1teracy Other schools offer ﬁnancral 
llteracy as 1ts own course Some st1ll embed 1t w1th1n both math and soc1alstud1es courses m order to ensure students are mteractmg w1th the content through both aspects of the curnculum 
The Department W111 be avarlable to prov1de add1t1ona1 mformatron on LD 1284 and respond to 
any questlons durmg the upcommg work sess1on 
S1ncerely,
