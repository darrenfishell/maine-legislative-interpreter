My name is Rob Roy and I have been a Technology Education teacher at Gorham 
High school for the past 38 years.  I have included and have taught several different 
units of financial literacy skills over the years.  I have always considered this to be a 
top priority!  I tell the kids that I use these financial skills all of the time in my day to 
day life. 
The topics that I have taught have included;
Building a yearly budget using a spreadsheet. How much do I make ... how much do I
spend .... and am I living within my means? 
Understanding your credit score and the importance of maintaining good credit! 
The cost of borrowing money (the real cost associated with taking out a loan and 
using credit cards) 
How you can use credit cards to your advantage
Opening up  checking and savings accounts.
Investing in general and NOT putting all of your financial eggs into one basket. 
Investing for retirement.
Understanding Insurance - Automobile, Homeowners, and Life Insurance.
The importance of having a RAINY DAY FUND .... Money you might need to access
if you have a financial crisis. 
The importance of purchasing enough LIFE INSURANCE (especially if you have 
children) 
Understanding your UTILITY bills ... Electric, water, sewer, heating & internet. 
I tell the kids that once you've made bad financial decisions  it can affect your credit 
score and everything in life will cost you more than someone who has managed their 
money wisely and has good credit! 
Unfortunately we live in a society where we are taught, early on in life, that 
consuming things and having "stuff"  will make us happy. This over consumption 
goes well beyond potentially hurting someone's  finances and credit score.  I always 
ask  the kids is the item or service you are  purchasing  based on a NEED or a 
WANT?   Overconsumption in general is killing the very environment that we live in.
