Commlttee on Educatlon and Cultural Affalrs 
My name 1s Mary Dyer and I serve as Presldent of the Mame JumpstartCoal1t10n for Personal 
Fmanclal Llteracy, an all-volunteer non-proﬁt whose prlmary mrsslon 1s provlde tramlng and 
professlonal development to Ma1ne’s K-12 personal ﬁnance and economrcs teachers I hvem 
Glenburn, and I am here to testlfy 1n support for L D 1284, An Act to Require Personal F inance 
to be Taught as a Separate Course to Obtain a High School Diploma 
Flrst, I would hke to thank Senator Daughtry and the blll co-sponsors for recognlzmg the cr1t1cal 
need to guarantee that all Mame students have equal access to robust ﬁnanclal educatlon before 
enterlng adulthood As a parent, taxpayer, and llfelong advocate of ﬁnanclal llteracy, I cannot 
thmk of anythmg more lmportant than provldmg our youth w1th the necessary ﬁnancral 
knowledge and skllls needed to achleve ﬁnanc1al 1ndependence Our abrhty to manage our 
ﬁnanclal affalrs affects every aspect of our hves and we make lmportant ﬁnancxal declslons 
every day 
For the past 14 years, through the work of Mame J umpstart and lts partners, hundreds of teachers 
have beneﬁted both personally and professronally from our personal ﬁnance trammgs, and asa 
result, thousands of students have recelved vltal ﬁnanclal educatlon However, despxte our 
efforts, only 28% of the nearly 100 teachers who attended our most recent tralnmg reported that 
they work at a school that requlres a stand-alone personal ﬁnance course Accordmg to the latest 
statewrde study completed by Next Gen Personal Fmance (NGPF), only 15% of Ma1ne students 
have access to a stand-alone course Conservatlvely, that leaves over 70% of Mame hlgh school 
students at a slgnlﬁcant dlsadvantage as they enter adulthood - a tlme when they are faced wlth 
llfe-changmg declslons about student loans, credlt cards, and other ﬁnanclal matters A student’s 
Zlp code should not dlctate thelr abllrty to make these d6ClSlOI1S We cannot contmue to 
collectlvely 1gnoreth1s d1spar1ty when we have the ab1l1ty to guarantee equal access for all
In the l4 years that I have been workrng to support Ma1ne’s personal ﬁnance teachers, I’ve come 
to understand the many challenges they face I’ve wrtnessed therr passron and commrtment to 
ﬁnancral educatron, desprte, 1n many cases a lack of support or resources from therr school or 
drstrrct They recogmze the crrtlcal need for ﬁnancral educatron, but sadly, most are only able to 
squeeze personal ﬁnance rnto other classes hke socral stud1es or math I belreve that approach rs 
overwhelmmg and drfﬁcult for teachers 
I come from a famlly of teachers My husband 1s a lrfelong health and physrcal educatron teacher, 
a class that 1s requrred to graduate from vrrtually all Marne hrgh schools As polrcy makers, I 
have no doubt that you all agree that physrcal health rs fundamental to ensurrng the future 
success and well-bemg of our youth I’m certarn that you also acknowledge the profound lmk 
between ﬁnanclal well-belng and physrcal and mental health Frnancral rssues are crted as the 
prrmary source of stress for most Amerrcans Knowrng thls, how can we deny equal access for all 
Marne students and potentrally set them up for a hfetrme of ﬁnancral struggle ‘? 
Make no mlstake, the outcome of th1s legrslatron w1ll have a profound rmpact on Marne people 
for many generatrons to come 
I appreciate your trme and I look forward to answermg any questrons that you may have
