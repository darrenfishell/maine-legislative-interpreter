Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, 
My name is Grace Leavitt My pronouns are she, her, hers I am serving as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51 I have over 43 years of 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certified teacher The MEA represents 
nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well as in our 
institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine Community 
College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as Well as many retired educators 
I am testifying on behalf of MEA in opposition to LD 1284 An Act to Require Personal Finance to be 
Taught as a Separate Course to Obtain a High School Diploma 
With few exceptions, MEA generally does not weigh in on legislation that calls for mandating 
curriculum LD 1284 goes fuither by mandating an additional course to be added to high school diploma 
requirements The course it calls for is on SLlb_]6Ct matter that is already required as it 1S included in the 
Maine Learning Results under the standards for Social S[Lldl6S1 The strand on Personal Finance and 
Economics outlines performance expectations for eveiy grade level Given the other existing high school 
diploma requirements and the fact that this Slll)_]6Cl matter is already part of the social studies curriculum, 
it seems unnecessary to require an additional course and it could prove challenging for many schools, 
and many students, to incorporate this into their schedules It would likely mean that students would 
have to forego another option in order to add this course when the matter 1S already addressed in their 
social studies classes 
MEA encourages you to vote ‘ought not to pass’ on LD 1284 
I am glad to answer any questions you may have
