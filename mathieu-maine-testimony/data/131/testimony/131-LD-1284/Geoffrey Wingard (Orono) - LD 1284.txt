LD 1284
Dear Representatives,
My name is Geoff Wingard. I am the 2022 Gilder Lehrman Maine History Teacher of
the Year and department head of the History Department at Bangor High School. I 
have been a secondary and post-secondary educator for over twenty years. Thank you 
for considering the importance of personal finance instruction in Maineâ€™s schools.
I am writing today to urge you to support LD1284, "An Act to Require Personal 
Finance to be Taught as a Separate Course to Obtain a High School Diploma." I think 
we can all agree that young adults in Maine must be equipped to navigate tumultuous 
financial times and be provided with a framework to make sound financial decisions 
that may impact their lives well into the future.
This bill will guarantee that all Maine high school students will benefit from this 
potentially life-changing instruction. At the school where I teach we experimented 
with integrating personal finance instruction in other social studies classes and found 
that trying to shoehorn more content into already rigorous courses diluted the content 
of existing courses and did not meet our curricular goals or the Maine Learning 
Results standards for personal finance. What we learned is that high quality personal 
finance education requires time and emphasis. For the past three years we have taught
the course as a stand alone, semester-long personal finance class for all 10th graders. I
hope that all Maine students, not just students in my district who already have this 
course as a standalone graduation standard, are able to receive instruction in this 
critical area. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the successful 
passage of LD1284.
Sincerely,
Geoffrey Wingard
