Senator Joseph Rafferty, Chair  
Representative Michael Brennan, Chair  
Joint Standing Committee on Education  
and Cultural Affairs  
 
Testimony in Support of L.D. 1284,  An Act to Require Personal Finance to be Taught as a Separate 
Course to Obtain a High School Diploma  
Senator Daughtry of Cumberland  
 
Chair Rafferty, Chair Brennan and Honorable Members:  
 
We strongly  support L.D. 1284 and thank Senator Daughtry for sponsoring this important bill.  As a 
threshold  matter, we hes itate to opine on curriculum policy in general  and appreciate  the many 
competing priorities this Committee must balance,  and the many challenges educators and school 
districts face on many fronts. Typically , OST offers testimony only on proposals directly  related to our 
specific Constitutional or statutory duties.  
 
With  this context and  standard in mind,  we find the reasons for requiring personal finance to be offered 
as a stand -alone course compelling enough to  take a position on LD 1284 and  submit this testimony.  
 
By law, the Treasurer serves as an ex officio member  of Maine Retirement Savings Board, a new entity 
created to establish and oversee the Maine Retirement Savings Program (MRSP). MRSP comes from 
legis lation enacted in the 130th Legislature sponsored by Senator Vitelli of Sagadahoc. The mission of 
the Board and MRSP is to facilitate private retirement savings by private sector workers in Maine who 
lack access to an employment -based option. Additionally,  by custom , the Treasurer serves as Chair of 
the Advisory Committee on Education Savings (ACES) which provides oversight and input on Maine’s 
official 529 plan, NextGen.   
 
Based on our work on both issues and in both roles, we  report that savings both for education and 
retirement in Maine need continued and intense support from all angles , including and especially 
in education policy related to the experience of students in grades 9 -12. 
 
Specifically, we believe that Maine stud ents face an urgent need to increase their capability for 
understanding ways to finance education beyond secondary school. Maine students must understand the 
benefits and risks of incurring unsecured debt and whether or how much such debt is necessary.  Maine 
workers and employers must be better positioned to understand the importance, options,  and methods for 
private retirement savings.  Stand -alone courses on personal finance is a solution.  
 
                                                                                                                    STATE OF MAINE

Deputy Treasurer  
The Legislature recently established the Maine Retirement  Savings Program . The Legislature and this 
Committee  has demonstrated strong support for Maine's 529 plan, made certain tax changes  to offer 
relief to student loan borrowers , and increased grants and tuition assistance both at the University of 
Maine and the Maine Community College System.   
 
One remaining crucial strategy has not completely  been implemented: comprehensive, specific,  and 
stand -alone personal finance education. The Department of Education and others strengthened personal 
finance education in Maine with 2019 law changes  supported by this Committee , but we believe 
Senator Daughtry’s proposal to  make this curriculum stand -alone is a logical  next step to increase 
financial capability generally,  increase retirement security , and empower Maine students to go on 
to attain credentials beyond high school with the necessary knowledge of borrowing, spending, 
planning, and earning . 
 
Thank you for your time and attention. As Senator Daughtry and  the Committee continue  work on L .D. 
1284, we offer ourselves as a resource.  
 
Sincerely,  
  
 
 
State Treasurer
