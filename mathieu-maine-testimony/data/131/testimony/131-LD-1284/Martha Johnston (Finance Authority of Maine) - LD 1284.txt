J olnt Standmg Commlttee on Educatlon and Cultural Affalrs 
Senator Rafferty, Representatwe Brennan, and D1st1ngu1shed Members of the J omt 
Standlng Comm1ttee on Educatlon and Cultural Affalrs 
My name 1s Martha Johnston I am the Dlrector of Educatlon at the Fmance 
Authorlty of Mame (FAME) I l1ve 1n Portland and am here to testrfy Nelther for Nor 
Agalnst L D 1284, An Act to Requzre Personal F mance to be Taught as a Separate 
Course to Obtam a Hzgh School Dzploma 
Th1s b1ll provldes that the current hlgh school dlploma 1nstruct1on requ1rement 
related to personal ﬁnance 1n statute must be met through a stand-alone course Whlle we 
beheve th1s 1s a pol1cy dec1s1on best left to the Leg1slature and Adm1n1strat1on 1n 
consultatlon wlth schools, teachers, parents, and students, FAME strongly beheves that 
all students 1n Mame should have equal access to h1gh-qual1ty ﬁnanclal educat1on pr1or to 
grad_uat1on _ _ 
Accordmg to the 2021 FINRA Foundatlon Natlonal F1nanc1al Capab1l1ty Study 
State-by-State survey, only 20% of Mame adults reported that they recelved ﬁnanclal 
educatlon 1n school, college, or the workplace FAME bel1eves that ﬁnancral capab1l1ty 1s 
the foundat1on that ensures a successful and prosperous future for Mame people and 1s 
cr1t1cal to ensure the success of Ma1ne’s future workforce and economy Mame w1ll not 
achleve these goals w1th only 20% of Mamers hav1ng access to ﬁnanclal educatlon 
For nearly a decade, FAME has offered extenslve ﬁnanclal educat1on resources 
and ﬁnanc1al wellness outreach to Ma1ne students, famlhes, and educators As you know, 
we help Mame bus1nesses grow and support Ma1ne people 1n affordlng hlgher educatlon 
through our ﬁnanclng and other programs such as grants, loans, and student loan 
forg1veness and repayment We have expanded our ﬁnanc1alwellness efforts and 
outreach 1n recent years, 1nclud1ng free onl1ne ﬁnanclal educat1on resources, classroom 
games and curnculum, employer ﬁnanc1al wellness programs, 1n-person events and
1
outreach to Mame schools We are also a foundatlonal supporter of the Mame Jumpstart 
Coal1t1on for Personal Fmancral L1teracy, an organrzatron whrch has provlded tralmng 
and professlonal development to Mame teachers for over fourteen years Our efforts are 
desrgned to help Mame people bulld lrfelong ﬁnanclal capabrlrty and to support them 1n 
maklng lnformed fmancral declsrons, so they are more economlcally secure throughout 
therr l1ves 
The mot1vat1on behlnd our ﬁnanc1al educat1on expansron stems from our 
expenence counsehng thousands of students and fam1l1es as they navlgate both the h1gher 
educatron ﬁnancmg and loan repayment process Through thrs work, we understand all 
too well the complex ﬁnanc1al dec1s1ons that Mame students must face 1n meetmg the 
costs of hrgher educat1on, and the equally devastatlng results when they are not fully 
educated and 1nformed when borrowlng Plarnly stated, we see the rmpact of a lack of 
ﬁnancral educatlon on a da1ly bas1s 1n our work at FAME and, whlle we offer extenslve 
resources to help Malners burld ﬁnanclal knowledge, 1t 1s s1mply not enough F1nanc1al 
wellness and ﬁnanclal capab1l1ty are s1gn1ﬁcant and cr1t1cal levers a fam1ly can pull as 1t 
relates to affordmg educatron after hrgh school 1nclud1ng maklng the dec1s10n to save 
early for college 
Thank you for your cons1derat1on of my comments I w1ll be happy to answer any 
questrons you have
