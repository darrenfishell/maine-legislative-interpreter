members I also served as V1ce P1'CS1dBt1lI of the Marne Chapter of FBLA 
I care about thls 1ssue because FBLA and more broadly access to busmess educatron and personal ﬁnance 
changed my perspectlve and opened new doors for me I want other students to have that same 
opportumty and share that expenence 
I took a personal ﬁnance course 1n h1gh school and I have spoken w1th h1gh school students, teachers, and 
Career and Techmcal Educatlon advocates across the country through my expenence 1n FBLA I notrced 
that states that requlred personal ﬁnance and provlded fundmg for busmess educat1on had waterfall 
effects and beneﬁts The return on mvestment for requmng personal ﬁnance 1s well known and W111 be 
covered by others here today I want to address somethrng that 1s l1kely not cons1dered Support for these 
programs rs often accompanied by the epportunity to provzde supplement expertenees and 
organtzatrons like FBLA that shape students 'perspectzves and outcomes 
Lack of exrstmg support for personal ﬁnance-related educauon restncts and l1m1ts students ’ ab1l1ty to 
partlclpate 1n Career and Techmcal Student Orga.n1zat10ns lrke FBLA, and l1m1ts therr opportumty to gam
