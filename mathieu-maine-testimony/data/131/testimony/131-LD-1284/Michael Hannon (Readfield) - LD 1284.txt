Thank you for taking my testimony.  I have been teaching financial literacy for 7 
years now while also teaching math for almost 20 years.  The number one thing that 
former students say to me is that the topics I teach are the most impactful on them as 
students, by far!  Furthermore, just about every adult I talk to about my finance class 
says “I wish I had that class when I was in school”.  The thing is, they did NOT have 
that class because it was not required.  It needs to be required so that all students have 
access to the information that can keep them out of unnecessary debt, build wealth 
over time, think about the future, delay gratification, build strategies and skills that 
will propel them into wealth and avoid financial pitfalls.  The more students we reach 
and educate with this kind of useful information, the more financially healthy the 
adults of Maine will be for years to come.  Please consider making personal finance a 
required course/credit for graduation in the state of Maine.
