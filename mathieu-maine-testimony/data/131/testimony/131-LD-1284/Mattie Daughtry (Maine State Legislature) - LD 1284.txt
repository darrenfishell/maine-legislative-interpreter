T esttmony of Senator Mattte Daughtrv lntroducing 
LD 1284, An Act to Require Personal Finance to be Taught as a Separate 
Course to Obtain a High School Diploma 
Before the Joint Standmg Committee on Educatton and Cultural Affairs 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Esteemed Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Mattie Daughtry, and I proudly 
represent Senate District 23, which includes Brunswick, Freeport, Harpswell, Pownal, 
Chebeague Island, and part of Yarmouth Today I am pleased to introduce my bill LD 1284, “An 
Act to Require Personal Finance to be Taught as a Separate Course to Obtain a High School 
Diploma” 
In 2020, 8 states guaranteed that all high school students took a stand-alone personal ﬁnance 
course Today, that number has grown to 19, and I hope that we can make Maine the 20th state to 
offer personal ﬁnance education to its high school students 
We all know the value of personal ﬁnance literacy High school students work _]0bS, have cell 
phones, take on side hustles, and carry insurance They have bank accounts, and they make 
investments At some point in their lives, they will make ﬁnancial decisions regardmg buyinga 
home, having a kid, or balancmg a household budget Too often, our Maine youth and young 
adults are not given the personal ﬁnance education they need to make well-informed personal 
ﬁnancial decisions that will impact their lives Without a statewide guarantee, incomplete 
enrollment in a personal ﬁnance education course leads to widenmg opportunity gaps between 
students who are well prepared for ﬁnancial realities post-graduation and those who are left to 
ﬁgure things out on their own 
Especially now, there 1S an urgent need for personal ﬁnance education in high school “Buy now 
and pay later” online shopping vendors, cryptocurrency speculation, and game-like investing 
apps target youth and exploit their low levels of proﬁciency When young Mainers are 
downloading apps and playing games on their phone and tablets, who can help them understand 
the potential real-life risks of clicking buttons and entermg debit or credit card information ‘? 
(Many adults don’t know these risks eitherl) Financial education would empower youth with 
critical thinking skills and signiﬁcantly improve their long-term ﬁnancial behaviors It would 
protect them from making personal ﬁnancial decisions that could set them back 
LD 1284 would meet this need with a Maine-speci ﬁc solution

0 It would guarantee that Personal Frnance Learmng Results are lmplemented for all 
students 1n Mame 
0 It would respect local control by consrderrng ex1st1ng graduat1on requrrements, 
mcorporatmg currlculum already used to ach1eve Learnmg Results, and respect1ng 
teacher hcensure for the course’s 1nstruct1on 
0 It would offer the course at l1ttle to no cost through Next Gen Personal F1nance’s free 
currlculum and professlonal development 
And th1s 1sn’t an exper1ment or a theory Already, 785 teachers have used th1s curnculum 1n 
Mame Over two hundred of these teachers have logged over 4,500 hours of profess1onal 
development Th1s currrculum beneﬁts the schools, the students, and the teachers — and I hope 
that we can extend these beneﬁts statewlde 
I know personally the value of such educatron When I was httle, I announced to my parents that 
I wanted to be an art1st when I grew up My father chuckled and _]Ok6d that, 1f I were golng to 
become an art1st, then I would need a trust fund So, when the holldays rolled around, I — not 
really know1ng what a trust fund was — asked for one To my parents’ cred1t, desplte their 
sarcasm, they took matters 1nto the1r own hands Wh1le a trust fund was out of the questron, they 
enrolled me 1n a m1m-course at our local ered1tun1on It helped me open my ﬁrst savmgs and 
checkmg accounts My parents also ensured that I contmued to learn as I got older and made sure 
I learned how to make budgets and ﬁnanc1al plans When I went to college for Studlo Art, they 
encouraged me to look 1nto a bus1ness tra1n1ng so that I could market my skllls I am forever 
grateful to them for thelr knowledge and encouragement, 1t all helped me become the 
entrepreneur I am today 
Let’s ensure that all Mame h1gh school students acqulre the personal ﬁnancral sk1lls they need to 
thnve 1n our state 
I thank you for your t1me, and I would be happy to answer any questlons you mrght have
