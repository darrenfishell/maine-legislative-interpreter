TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1284  
 
AN ACT TO REQUIRE PERSONAL FINANCE TO BE TAUGHT AS A  
SEPARATE COURSE TO OBTAIN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Ei leen King, deputy executive director of Maine  School Management Association, testifying on behalf 
of the legislative committees of the Maine School  Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in opposition to  L.D. 1284 . 
 
High School diploma standards are outlined in 20 -A, section 4722, and personal finance already is required. 
This bill would make that a stand -alone course , and we acknowledge the sponsorâ€™s passion around this topic . 
 
Personal finance is referenced in 20 -A, Section 254, number 13, that tasks the commissioner of education with  
developing an integrated model for instruction in personal finance that may be used at the high school level.  
Our concern has been and remains that curriculum should not be mandated.  
 
School Boards are charged with adopting the courses of study that align  with the system of Learning Results. 
That is a local decision and should remain so.  
 
Additional courses beyond the core curriculum are and have to remain  the purview of the School Board . If 
not, we lose control over the school day and also risk losing cont rol over what we are teaching.
