Senator Joseph Rafferty, Chair  
Representative Michael Brennan, Chair  
Joint Standing Committee on Education  
and Cultural Affairs  
 
Testimony in Support of L.D. 1284,  An Act to Require Personal Finance to be Taught as a Separate 
Course to Obtain a High School Diploma  
Senator Daughtry of Sagadahoc  
 
Chair Rafferty, Chair Brennan and Honorable Members:  
 
We strongly  support L.D. 1284 and thank Senator Daughtry for sponso ring this important bill.  As a 
threshold  matter, we hesitate to opine on curriculum policy in general  and apprecia te the many 
competing priorities this Committee must balance,  and the many challenges educators and school 
districts face on many fronts. Typically , OST offers testimony only on proposals directly  related to our 
specific Constitutional or statutory duties.  
 
With  this context and  standard in mind,  we find the reasons for requiring personal finance to be offered 
as a stand -alone course compelling enough to  take a position on LD 1284 and  submit this testimo ny. 
 
By law, the Treasurer serves as an ex officio member  of Maine Retirement Savings Board, a new entit y 
created to establish and oversee the Maine Retir ement Sa vings Program  (MRSP ). MRSP  comes from 
legislation  enacted in the 1 30th Legislature sponsored by Senator V itelli of Sagadahoc . The mission of 
the Board and MRSP is to facilitat e private retirement savin gs by private sector w orkers in Maine  who 
lack access to a n employment -based  option . Addi tionally, b y custom , the Treasu rer serves as Chair of 
the Advis ory Committee on Education  Savings (ACES)  which provides oversight and input on Maine ’s 
official 529 plan , NextGen.   
 
Based on our work on both issues and in both roles, we  report that savings both for education and 
retirement  in Maine need continued and intense support from all a ngles, including and especially 
in education policy related to  the experience  of students in grades 9 -12. 
 
Specifically, we believe that Maine students face an urgent need to increase their capability for 
understanding ways to finance educatio n beyond secondary school. Maine students must understand the 
benefits and risks of incurring unsecured debt and whether or how much such debt is necessary.  Maine 
workers and employers must be better positioned to understand  the importance, options,  and methods for 
priva te retir ement savings.  Stand -alone cour ses on persona l finance is a solution.

Deputy Treasurer  
The Legislature recently esta blished the Maine Retirement  Savings P rogram . The Legisl ature a nd this 
Committee  has demonstrated strong support for Maine's 529 plan, made certain tax changes  to offer 
relief to s tudent loan b orrowers , and increased grants and tuition assistance both at the University of 
Maine and the Maine Community College System.   
 
One remaining  crucial strategy has not compl etely  been implemented: compreh ensive , specific,  and 
stand -alone personal finance education . The Department of Education and others strengthened personal 
finance education in Maine with 2019 law changes  supported by thi s Com mittee, but we beli eve 
Sena tor Daughtry ’s proposal  to make this curriculu m stand -alone is a logical  next step to increase 
financial capability generally,  increase retirement security , and empower Maine students to go on 
to attain c redentials beyond  high school  with the necessary knowledge  of borrowing, spending, 
planning,  and earning . 
 
Thank you for your time and attention. As Senator Daughtry and  the C omm ittee continue  work on L .D. 
1284, we offer ou rselves as a resource.  
 
Sincerely,  
  
 
 
State Treasurer
