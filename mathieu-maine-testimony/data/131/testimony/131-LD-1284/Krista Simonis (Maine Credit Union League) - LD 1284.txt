Good Afternoon, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of 
the Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, 
My name is Krista Simonis and lam the Director ofGovernmental Affairs at the Maine Credit 
Union League The l\/laine Credit Union League is the trade association for Maine's 50 credit 
unions and over 725,000 members statewide We respectfully submit the following testimony 
neither for nor against LD 1 284 
While we recognize the challenges in mandating additional requirements for public schools 
already straining for resources, we strongly believe financial education is key to a successful 
future Providing education, training, and information is one of the cooperative principles at 
the core of the credit union movement's identity That is why, since 2004, we have been 
putting on Financial Fitness Fairs for students and adults throughout the state Since the 
program's inception, more than 70,000 students have had the chance to go through this 
supplementary curriculum and walk through a simulated career, budget, and credit score 
Additionally, we believe financial literacy is a key component in achieving our long-term goal 
of ending hunger As part of the Campaign for Ending Hunger, which raised over $1 million 
last year, we are working with community partners to distiibute financial educational 
resources in several languages to food pantries Stopping food insecurity and achieving 
financial wellness starts with a balanced budget 
Research from the National Financial Capability Study supports these beliefs In their study, 
those individuals with higher financial literacy were more likely to make ends meet, spend 
less of their income, save more for emergencies, and plan for retirement At its best, financial 
education should be used to help students learn to break the cycle of poverty 
Prior to JOIHIHQ the League, l vi/orked for a high school in the state Students who hada 
chance to take the Personal Finance course offered by the school frequently spoke of hovv 
valuable it was to them Others who had learned more in other courses about compound 
interest and investing were excited by the opportunity to save money so that their money 
could make money l had students ask questions about what to do about overdrafts, how to 
get a car loan, and what they needed to open a savings account These are important life 
skills that are needed in order to become successful adults 
We often think of the disparities in education in terms of reading, math, and science, but 
disparity in financial education has a real impact on student success’ later in life and can

worsen existing inequities Not every student lives in a home where savings, budgeting, and 
check writing is taught 
The Maine Credit Union League has been a recipient ofthe national Desjardins Award for 
Youth Financial Education for a record 18 consecutive years We Wlll continue our efforts to 
provide financial education and curriculum resources, and we are glad to see the committee 
consider this important topic While we are in favor of financial education for all, we 
recognize the challenges ofa mandate and have no official position at this time We hope to 
be considered as a resource as the committee deliberates
