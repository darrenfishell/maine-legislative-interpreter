PO Box 103 Dryden, ME 04225 
(207) 578-4364 
Good morning, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education & 
Cultural Affairs Committee, 
My name is Siiri Stinson While I am both an IRS-certified Volunteer Tax-preparer and the 
Program Coordinator for the Peer-to-Peer Financial Literacy and Education Program, currently 
housed at the University of Maine at Farmington, I am testifying today as a resident of Wilton, 
drawing from my experience in both capacities I strongly believe the language in LD1284 
amending MRSA §4722, sub-§2, 1[B to reflect specifically that personal finance must be taught 
as a required stand-alone course for Maine high school graduates is necessary in order to 
ensure every student has the opportunity to learn, practice, and ideally master the tools and 
concepts that will help prepare them for life after high school, increase confidence in financial 
matters, and thereby reduce the adverse health and financial outcomes of Maine people 
Of the hundreds of college students and dozens of high school students I have spoken with 
since accepting this position, I have met only one who has voluntarily taken a personal finance 
course That one student, an Upward Bound high school student from Maine, remarked in the 
group about how beneficial it had been He explained most students hadn’t taken it because it 
was not required, people are afraid of math, and so, especially if family culture has created 
shame around money topics, a class focused on money would not be desirable His fellow 
Upward Bound peers agreed, noting they need the class, want the skills, are afraid to take it 
and, if not required, would probably avoid it due to that fear 
This sentiment has been echoed by countless college students l’ve met with Frustrated 
exclamations are common, including “Why didn’t anyone teach us about all this adulting stuff 
BEFORE we have to actually do it'7”(“My parents are stuck and don’t have a clue about this 
stuff, they never got it eitherl I need to go help theml" Community members have offered similar 
sentiments, lamenting entering adulthood blindly and figuring it out as they go with varying 
degrees of success 
This is avoidable There are so many ways to teach financial concepts experientially to help 
high school students move through, practice, and really internalize material Lesson plans can 
be adapted for different ability levels, and tailored to specific learning styles There are free, 
prepared virtual and printed resources, teacher training modules, and beneficial activity 
resources that have been created, tested, and offered by organizations like Jump$tart, FAME, NQPF, 
and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to help schools plan, prepare, and implement 
these courses We are relying on our young people to become productive, healthy, contributing 
members of society, and have a responsibility to offer them the tools and resources they need to 
move forward into adulthood successfully, reducing the stigma of generational poverty, and they 
agree that requiring it is the only way that shift will happen

RequIrIng FInancIal Llteracy course for HS Graduatlon 
It has been roughly a year sInce I started my fInancIal hteracyjourney as a Peer FInancIal Educator based 
at the UnIversIty of MaIne at FarmIngton ExposIng me to the concepts and all the resources rewards me 
In the folIowIng ways ’K 
0 Awareness of the Importance of fInancIal lIteracy for hIgh school students 
Ideally, no adults would regret that they mIssed theIr chances to further the|r educatIon after hIgh school 
due to fInancIa| Issues There are so many channels that support hIgh school students ‘ access to h|gher 
educatIon, makIng theIr dreams come truefbut students must know about these resources If the 
myrIads of scholarsh|ps, wh|ch come from communItIes, organIzatI0ns, both state and federal 
government, eIther based on fInancIal needs or academlc merIts, were presented to hIgh school 
students early, they would be both economIcally beneﬁted and have h|gher self-expectatIons, knowIng 
they need not worry about lack of fInancIal support I regularly search for scholarshlps through 
Igrad/FAME (fame enrIch org), or lIsts of sponsors from UMF and other relIable websltes, and found out 
the varIous scholarshIps are ongoIng all year round More students wIth more opportunItIes to get Into 
college and earn a degree, wIth less debt after graduatIon would, In return, also beneﬁt communItIes, 
states, and federal governments 
0 Knowledge of student loans 
I was fearful of loans There was a huge amount of pressure on my shoulders daIly, affectIng my mental 
health as well as my academIc achIevements I worrIed about how I was goIng to repay the debt, 
wondered what optIons were avaIIable etc However, wIth Increased knowledge, my understandIng of 
both access and repayment optIons for student loans has been a great dIscovery and experlence, gIvIng 
me Increased peace 
0 UnderstandIng budgets and Increased personal fInancIal wellness \ 
FInancIally, I am cautIous After beIng exposed to fInancIal lIteracy, I realIzed good budgets can help 
balance my Income and expenses, thus benefItIng my fInancIal wellness, mental health and physIcal 
health as well I do not need to be so stIngy and feel guIlty whenever I reward myself a lIttle bIt by 
eatIng/buyIng somethIng that makes’ 
me happy '- 
lt Is necessary for hIgh school students to take fInancIal lIteracy as a course notjust as modules 
or a few loose assIgnments Only If It IS taught as a course wIll students have an overall vIew of what 
fInancIal lIteracy looks lIke systematIcally Dolng It In modules Is lIke addIng patches here and there, sInce 
what IS learned wlthout full context may be forgotten easIly and quIckly WIth more complete awareness 
and knowledge about fInancIal lIteracy, hIgh school students mIght become Interested In Investments, 
cherIsh the|r credlt scores, and develop good spendIng habIts by |IvIng wIthIn theIr means If hIgh school 
students take fInancIal lIteracy courses serlously, they would be able to talk to parents earher and make 
fInancIal plans for h|gher educatIon, Includmg choosIng a 529 college savIngs plan It Is a long-term 
Investment for wellness and happIness
