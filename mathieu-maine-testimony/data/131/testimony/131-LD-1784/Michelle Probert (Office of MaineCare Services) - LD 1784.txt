Re:  LD 1784 – Resolve, to Improve Access to Appropriate Levels of Long -term Care by 
Rebasing and Increasing Reimbursement Rates  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide information and share our  opposition to LD 1784 – Resolve, to Improve 
Access to Appropriate Levels of Long -term Care by Rebasing and Increasing Reimbursement 
Rates . 
 
This resolve requires the Department to: 1) rebase reimbursement rates, effective July 1, 2023, to 
reflect the increased costs experienced by nursing facilities; 2) amend its rules in Chapter 101: 
MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 67, Princip les of Reimbursement for Nursing 
Facilities  to provide that, effective July 1, 2023, the upper limit on the base year case mix and 
regionally adjusted cost per day is the median multiplied by 130%; and 3) work with nursing 
facilities to improve access to t he facilities for patients with certain special needs.  
 
The rate reform system established last year in P L 2021 Ch. 639 created a process for analyzing 
and prioritizing rates paid to providers. The Department is in the midst of rate reform efforts for 
Nursing Facilities (NFs) and Residential Care Facilities  (RCFs) , which should be completed by 
the end of 2023 and be ready for consideration by the legislature in 2024 and ready for January 1, 
2025 implementation.  The study aims to accurately establish the c ost of NFs/RCFs services in 
Maine to determine a pathway for moving from a cost settlement methodology to reimbursement 
based fully or in part on prospective payments; align payment to performance on specified 
measures to promote quality service provision,  resident health outcomes, equity, and/or experience 
of care; and explore opportunities to make NFs/RCFs services financially sustainable. This will 
include study and determination of different factors that may warrant differentiation of rates, such 
as nur sing facilities that provide services to patients with special needs.  
 
The goal of PL 2021 Ch. 639  was in part to move toward more consistent, equitable and data 
driven rates that create incentives for efficiency and high -quality care for members. This bill 
perpetuates a system of rate setting that  conflicts with P.L. 2021, Ch. 639 by establishing percent  
increases that have not been developed through the systematic, methodological approach mandated 
in PL 2021 Ch. 639  which the Department is already undertaking.   
 
 
 Nursing facilities are presently rebased every two years and receive COLA adjustments in t he 
interim years , the next COLA coming in July . In addition, nursing facilities received adjustments 
in July 2022 and January 2023  as part of  PL 2021 Ch. 639 , sec.  AAAA . This is on top of two $25  
million  COVID supplemental payments for long -term care in  State Fiscal Year 2023.  
 
If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director
