Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
and Hurnan Services, I am Katie Fullam Harris of MaineHealth, and I am here to testify in support 
of LD 1784, “Resolve, to Improve Access to Appropriate Levels of Long-term Care by Rebasing , 
and Increasing Reinibursement Rates” 
Maine is in the midst of a crisis 1I1 access to long-term care Yesterday, MaineHealth hospitals had 57 
patients who were ready for discharge to nursing level long-terrn care, but for which there 1S no 
available placement Ma1ne’s laws and rules that govern long-term care are complex and failing to 
support adequate capacity to meet the needs of our population In addition, in spite of recent ~ -~ ~ ——- —~- -~ 
investments, MaineCare reimbursement for nursing facilities has failed to keep up with c6sts;' and‘;i"—-~:‘ - --it - 
particularly the cost of labor , 
As a result, 15 facilities have closed since 2020, and another in our service area ]ust announced its 
closure this year MaineHealth ’s own St ]oseph’s Manor in Portland loses nearly $1 million per r " 
month as it struggles to maintain adequate staffing to support its residents Yet, without it, the 
number of people stuck at Maine Medical Center would be signiﬁcantly higher The system is 
fundamentally broken 
This bill would provide a one-time rebase of nursing facility rates to reﬂect the current costs 
experienced by nursmg facilities It would ﬁirther increase the Upper Payment Limit to allow for 
increased ﬁnancial ﬂexibility Finally, and very importantly, it would start to address the serious 
problem of patients with special needs who represent a signiﬁcant portion of the population who are 
stuck in hospitals Nursing facilities should receive adequate reimbursement to care for individuals 
whose needs require specialty staffing and care 
Thank you for the opportunity to support this important bill This, in COI1]L1nCt101 ‘1 with LD 1785, 
will make a signiﬁcant difference in starting to reopen access to much-needed residential care for our 
vulnerable populations 
Thank you, and I would be happy to answer questions
