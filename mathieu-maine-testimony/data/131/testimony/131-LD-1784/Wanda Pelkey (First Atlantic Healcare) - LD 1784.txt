by Rebasmg and Increasing Reimbursement Rates 
Dear Senator Baldaccl, Representat1ve Meyer, and d1st1ngu1shed members of the 
Commlttee on Health and Human Servrces My name 1s Wanda Pelkey, and I serve as the board 
charr of the MHCA and CFO ofF1rstAtlant1c HealthCare My company represents 23 nurs1ng 
fac1l1ty and res1dent1al care homes throughout Mame Saco, Portland, Freeport, Falmouth, 
Skowhegan, Lew1ston, Dexter, Dover-Foxcroft, Bangor, Ellsworth, Machlas, Llncoln, 
Mlllrnocket, Calals, Houlton, Watervrlle and Madawaska 
I’m askrng for your support of th1s b1ll to help preserve Malnecare res1dent ’s access to 
qual1ty servrces w1th payment rates that are adequate to sustaln the healthcare system 
You have heard about how hard 1t 1s to ﬁnd and keep workers, especlally CNA’s and 
nurses Mame DOL contrnues to report how workers are not returnlng to long-term care and 
most eam more when leavlng the profess1on You’ve also heard how temporary stafﬁng 
agencles are taklng unfalr advantage of the worker scarclty For th1s reason alone, costs are 
umnanageably r1s1ng, not to mentron nslng costs of ut1l1t1es, supphes and 1nterest rates 
Currently the law requrres DHHS to rebase NF rates every two years based on actual 
costs as reported on the most recently ﬁled fac1l1ty cost reports And 1n the off year, rates are 
21Cl_]l1StC(l by a COLA Unfortunately, these regular rate 3d_]11S'tI ‘1'1€I1tS are Just not keep1ng up 
Dur1ng the pandemlc, federal and state rehef programs were br1dg1ng the gap These programs 
are endmg and expos1ng a large fundmg gap that 1f not dealt wlth w1ll lead to more closures
f
You know NF rate reform work 1s currently underway and scheduled for 2025 Whrle 
that’s not too d1stant1n one sense, 1t’s also too long to wart Many of my nursrng fac1l1t1es are 
today operatmg w1th s1gn1ﬁcant cash ﬂow deﬁcrts depletmg cash reserves at an alarmlng rate 
In many locatlons I’m struggllng to make payroll each week and 1t’s qulckly becomlng an acute 
concern for the others Even th1s b1ll’s t1m1ng may be too late for some and when closures occur, 
1t w1ll be swlft and wlthout regard to areas most needrng access to NF servlces The resrdents 
Wlll lose thelr homes and hosprtals w1ll have fewer fac1l1t1es to drscharge therr NF level pat1ents 
to That Marne has already lost 15 NFs over the last couple years lndlcates how perllously close 
to dem1se we’re operat1ng as a health care sector 
Th1s b1ll does two lmportant thmgs 
F1rst, 1t permlts and dlrects the Department to rebase rates one extra tlme th1s July 1 usmg 
costs from 2022 ﬁled cost reports Another regularly scheduled rebaslng w11l occur the 
followmg July l and after that rate reform work should be completed and rmplemented Th1s 
“off-cycle ” rebasmg w1ll cause an adjustment to rates to respond to uncontrollable r1s1ng 
workforce costs and 1nﬂat1onthat ’s not adequately met by a COLA adjustment alone 
Second, the upper l1m1t for rates would be set at 130% of statewlde cost medlans rather 
than 110% 1n statute today Under th1s prov1s1on each faclllty 1s rebased at actual cost per day or 
the upper l1m1t whlchever 1s less As 1s, the upper l1m1t set at 110% causes about a thlrd of 
fac1l1t1es to not get costs fully rebased Those most at r1sk are those operat1ng where worker 
market rates are hrghest, where drrect care workers are most scarce and/or where agency stafﬁng 
has taken root
f 
Wrth these changes, NF payments w1ll st1ll max out at cost, and many w1ll st1ll not 
achleve full-cost relmbursement The DHHS D1v1s1on of Audlt w1ll st1ll be fully aud1t1ng costs 
to ensure only reasonable and necessary expenses are relmbursed These l1m1ts by des1gn w1ll 
st1ll encourage and reward cost efﬁc1enc1es wh1le the ra1s1ng of upper l1m1ts to 130% of medrans 
should enable more fac1l1t1es to secure adequate rates It’s not perfect, but better 
Commlttee, I urge you for the sake of preservmg homes for our most frall c1t1zens to 
support th1s b1ll Unless rates are adequately adjusted by th1s or another fund1ng solut1on many 
of our locatlons won’t surv1ve for long
