Senator Chipman, Senator Nangle, Senator Farrin and members of the Transportation 
Committee. I’m Mike Soboleski and I represent the 73"’ District in the westem 
Mountains. I’m here to present LD 1938 An Act to Require a reminder for Vehicle 
Registration Renewal. 
Much like the post card renewal notice sent to Maine drivers when their License is 
nearing expiration, this bill requires a notice be sent to the holder of a vehicle registration 
reminding them their registration is nearing expiration. 
I’ve done it many times and I bet you have too. I notice the license plate on my truck, or 
someone notices, and the registration has expired by a month or two or more. 
The intent of this bill is to help keep registrations current, cut down on trafﬁc stops, ease 
congestion in the court system, and with timely registrations help the state get registration 
fee faster. 
Thank you for your time. I’m happy to answer questions and provide additional 
information for the work session. 
Sincerely, 
/Vi I/with/i /~g~i0¢'i£Jz., ’
