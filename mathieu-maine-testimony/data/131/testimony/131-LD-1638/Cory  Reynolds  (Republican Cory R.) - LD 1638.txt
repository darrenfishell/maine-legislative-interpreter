Republican Cory R.
LD 1638
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and the distinguished members of the 
Committee on Taxation, my name is Cory Reynolds and I am in Support of LD - 
1231, 1434, 1638, 1651, and 1671. I believe We need to lower Maine Taxes. With 
President Biden and Janet Mills in Office inflation has been high it has ever Been in 
history. We pay taxes on food, gas, basically everything I believe we need to get rid 
of paying Taxes. please I ask urge you to vote ought to pass on all these bills. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
