4/3/23 TESTIMONY FOR LD 22— 
TRANSFER OF FIREARMS TO PROHIBITED PEOPLE 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of the 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, l am Carol Seisberg, an 85-year-old 
grandmother from Eliot, Maine urging you to pass LD22. 
l don’t want to come back a 4*“ time to testify on firearm problems so dire they are 
now the number one cause of death for children and teenagers. l am with the 
majority of Americans NOT against the 2d Amendment but the words “well- 
regulated ” are not there for nothing. 
Why would somebody want your gun rather than go through the usual dealers and 
legal steps? You wouldn’t give your car to someone without driver training, a 
license, or with a negligent driving. record. How do you know that person doesn’t 
have a criminal background, suicidal tendencies, domestic violence history? A 2016 
Colorado Public Radio survey of prison inmates found that most got guns used in 
their crimes illegally or as gifts from friends and family. 
On average, Maine suffers 146 gun deathsa _ year. (Everytown Research.org). Last 
year, we got an F from Giffords Law Center because we lack reasonable 
regulations (WABI Ch. 5). America lost 10,566 to violent gun deaths... lN THE 
FIRST 3 MONTHS OF 2023! (Gun Violence Archives). Giffords Law also reminds 
us" that at least 43,000 Americans die from gun violence every year. Imagine that 
number in terms of the town populations you represent here.‘ 
So my final question to this committee on LD 22 and all the other LD’s -l’ll be 
testifying on today is:- What’s the downside of voting Ought to Pass? Who loses 
when you make deadly weapons safer? How many more years and lives must 
pass before those in charge pass protective laws for deadly weapons? 
Thank you for your commitment to the people of Maine, and for using your office to 
save lives with a lot more than thoughts and prayers, by voting LD 22 Ought to 
Pass.
