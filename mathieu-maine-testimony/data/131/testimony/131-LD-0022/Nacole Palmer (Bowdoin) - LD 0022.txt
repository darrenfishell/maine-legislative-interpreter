Senator Beebe-Center and Rep. Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Committee 
on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. My name is Nacole Palmer, and I live in Bowdoin, 
Maine. 
I stand before you now in support of LD 22, An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms 
to Prohibited Persons. This is a bill that may seem unnecessary, but that would onlybe 
because it falls under the category of, “how is this not already a law?” Making it illegal to 
knowingly give a gun to a prohibited person is already federally prohibited, but it is 
inexplicably not prohibited under the state law in Maine. There are tons of things that 
are prohibited under federal law as well as under state law, and the overlap is 
necessary from a legal perspective because it gives prosecutors more options when 
faced with people who have knowingly given a gun to people who can’t passa 
background check. 
This bill, in combination with the other gun safety bill before you today, would strengthen 
the ability of law enforcement to protect our citizens, and create a stronger fabric 
against gun violence here in Maine.‘ 
I urge you to vote ought to pass for LD 22, and I thank you for your consideration.
