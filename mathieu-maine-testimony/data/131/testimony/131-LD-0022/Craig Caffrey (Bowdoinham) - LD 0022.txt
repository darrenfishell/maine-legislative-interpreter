LD 22 “An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons” 
 
 Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and the Committee of Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety. My name is Craig Caffrey of Bowdoinham, and I am submitting my testimony 
opposing LD 22 “An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons.” 
 
As a Veteran with over two decades of service, I am appalled to come home and find more and 
more of our unalienable rights being slowly stripped away through smear campaigns, the use of children 
as propaganda tools and outright lies. Throughout my career, I have seen bureaucrats go above and 
beyond fighting for the industrial military complex, the corporate media, and those who donate towards 
their own party. Yet very few are courageous enough to stand up for the average American. 
 
This bill in particular is very broad and could be used to set up law abiding citizens in “gotcha” 
scenarios. Furthermore, according to Federal Law and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives (ATF), The Gun Control Act at 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) makes it unlawful to sell or otherwise dispose 
of firearms or ammunition to any person who is prohibited from shipping, transporting, receiving, or 
possessing firearms or ammunition. 
 
I request this committee to vote “ought not to pass” LD 22 “An Act to Impede the Transfer of 
Firearms to Prohibited Persons” and start going after criminals and stop harassing law-abiding citizens 
with needless bills. 
 
Thank you for your time, 
Craig Caffrey 
Bowdoinham 
Chief Petty Officer USN (Ret.)
