LD 22: An Act Regarding to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons 
Why would we not what to pass a law so people that makes it harder for people 
not allowed to own or have a ﬁrearm can't get a ﬁrearm? 
Why am I here. I was born in Waterville, raised in S. China, went to MMA and 
then was an ofﬁcer in the Navy during Operation Desert Storm on an Aircraft 
Carrier. I've worked in Outside Technical Sales for 30 years in New England and 
the Midwest. 
Our son, Ryan at 16 years of age was able to steal a gun and ammo from the store 
he worked at and died by suicide that night, Sat. Dec. 5"‘ , 2020at 9:35PM. 
In the resent school shooting in Nashville, l know one of the teachers that works 
there. Thankfully, she was not harmed physically. 
Things need to change in Maine and the country to protect our people from 
themselves and others. I am a gun owner and hunter. I'm for common sense gun 
laws that will make it harder to commit crimes with a gun or die by suicide witha 
gun. 
Thank-you!
