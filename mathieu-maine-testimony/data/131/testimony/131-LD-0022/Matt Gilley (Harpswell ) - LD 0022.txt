Matt Gilley
Harpswell 
LD 22
Good afternoon Senator Beebe-Center and representative Salisbury and distinguished 
members of the criminal justice and public safety committee. My name is Matthew 
Gilley and I am a lifelong resident of Harpswell. I am writing to you today in 
opposition of ld 22. It is already illegal to sell a firearm to a prohibited person 
federally and on the state level. This bill seems to change the definition of prohibited 
person to one that is unreasonable for a person making a sale to determine. This 
creates a slippery slope that can make law abiding citizens criminals. I hope you vote 
ought not pass. Thank you.
