LD 22
Please forgive my grammar and punctuation if it is lacking. I did my best.
Thank you!
Antique firearms are hardly used in crime from recent statistics I can find online. I 
cannot find statistics that are ONLY for Maine. I am going to go out on a limb and 
say probably almost zero percent of all armed crime committed in Maine is 
committed with antique firearms. If the federal government and the Almighty BATFE
doesn't think antique firearms are a problem that needs to be subject to background 
checks, why does the Maine government? We do not need more laws in place for 
things that are not problems. Felons are already prohibited from owning antique 
firearms in Maine anyway. Sounds like a double negative to me. The only people who
are going to be affected by LD 22 if it goes into law are regular joe firearm 
enthusiasts, collectors and antique firearm enjoyers. Felons who wish to do harm are 
not going to bother with black powder single shot muzzle loading rifles, cap and ball 
revolvers or single shot pistols; They are going to get something modern, probably 
more reliable, and less smelly than black powder firing weapons.
 This is why I believe LD 22 should not become law.
