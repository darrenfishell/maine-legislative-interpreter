LD 22
  I am writing to express my opposition to LD 22, an Act to impede the transfer of 
firearms to prohibited persons. I believe LD 22 is a first step towards the goal of 
prohibiting the private sale of firearms in the State of Maine. Once the structure of the
act is in place, the terms “knowingly and intentionally” could be attempted to be 
removed from the text. The penalties of LD 22 are exclusively directed towards the 
seller of the firearm. The seller of the firearm most likely does not have a criminal 
record. The potential prohibited person has a criminal record and knows what they are
doing but LD 22 would not punish the prohibited person. A private seller would be 
forced to use a federally licensed dealer to protect themselves from the criminal 
penalties under LD 22. Most dealers charge a fee for facilitating private transactions. 
These fees are a financial burden on low income individuals trying to exercise their 
civil rights. If the State has an interest in background checks for the private sale of 
firearms then the State should bear the burden for any associated financial costs.
Most gunners are law abiding and do not want their guns to fall into the wrong 
hands but they also do not want to be penalized simply for selling their property. LD 
22 is the wrong approach and ought not to pass.
