Senator

and
distinguished
members

the

thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit 
testimony
regarding
LD
22.
My
testimony
on
this
matter
will
be
brief.
According
to
the
Bureau
of
Alcohol,
T obacco,
Firearms
and
Explosives
(A TF),
The
Gun
Control
Act
at
18
U.S.C.
§
922(d)
makes
it
unlawful
to
sell
or
otherwise
dispose
of
firearms
or
ammunition
to
any
person
who
is
prohibited
from
shipping,
transporting,
receiving,
or
possessing
firearms
or
ammunition.
It
is
already
illegal
under
federal
law
to
transfer
a
firearm
to
a
prohibited
person.
