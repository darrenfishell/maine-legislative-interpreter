LD 22
I oppose LD 22 " An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons".
LD 22 is an overly broad bill that puts Maine out of alignment with federal law 
regarding the sale of antique firearms. This bill classifies these firearms in the same 
class as all other firearms, resulting in a conflict with how these sales are processed. 
This would put sellers who follow federal law in violation of state law.
Again, I oppose I oppose LD 22 " An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After 
the Sale of a Firearm ", and it "ought not to pass".
