LD 22
Dear Honorable Members of the Committee,
I urge you to oppose LD 22 An act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited 
Persons.
LD 22 is an overly broad bill that puts Maine out of alignment with federal law 
regarding the sale of antique firearms. This bill classifies these firearms in the same 
class as all other firearms, resulting in a conflict with how these sales are processed. 
This would put sellers who follow federal law in violation of state law.
