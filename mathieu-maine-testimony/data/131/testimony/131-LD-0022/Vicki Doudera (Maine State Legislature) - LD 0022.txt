Testimony of Representative Vicki Doudera supporting 
LD 22, An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Good afternoon Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. My name is Vicki Doudera and 
I represent House District 41, which includes Camden and Rockport. I am here today in support 
of LD 22, An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons. 
This bill is very straightforward: it prohibits the sale or transfer of a ﬁrearm to a person who is 
not legally allowed to own or possess one. 
I have met many, many gun owners in our state and when we talk about ﬁrearms, we agree on 
many things: ﬁrst, our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Second, that safely storing 
ﬁrearms is critical. Third, education is key to people understanding responsible gun ownership. 
And ﬁnally, we agree that persons prohibited from having guns should not be able to get them. 
I thank Senator Carney for bringing this bill forward and for working with the stakeholders 
involved to address this public safety concern. This bill is responsible and sensible, and it will 
help save Maine lives. Guns do not belong in the hands of those prohibited from having them. 
I urge you to support the measure. 
Thank you. 
Representative Vicki Doudera 
District 41: Camden and Rockport
