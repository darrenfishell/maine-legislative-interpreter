Good afternoon Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Stephen Brough from Bangor and l must rise in opposition to LD 22. 
This proposed law honestly has me perplexed, as there is already a similar law 
on the books at a federal level with a higher penalty. (18) USC 922 (a)(5) and 
922(d). 
Do the boilerplate operators within the Democratic party know so little about 
laws already in affect that they propose dual legislation? Or did someone stick 
this in front of a Rep. and say "Here, sign on for this."? We all know it happens, 
don't kid yourself that it doesn't happen and that we don't know it. When 
legislators can't explain or defend their own bills, it's only too obvious. 
This law will provide nothing in the way of an increase in safety, merely the 
appearance thereof to the uneducated. 
Think about this: 
A person wants to sell a firearm to a prohibited person. Say your typical Maine 
gang-banger wannabe. Could be a prohibited out-of-state buyer. There is 
already a federal law on the books making this a criminal act. Criminals by 
definition don't follow gun laws. 
What reasonable belief do you have that that same person violating federal law 
is going to suddenly declare, "Wait! That's against the state law, l better not do 
that!" Seriously. 
It completely defies logic that this law would do a darn thing to actually prevent 
gun crimes. Yet here_we are, demonstrating that this will be ineffective at best 
and every minute spent on this bill thus far is a complete waste of the
I 
Legislatures time that could have been spent working on something of 
substance.
