RE: Testimony in opposition to LD 22 , An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to
Prohibited Persons
I was born in Maine in 1948. I have been a gun owner sense the late 1950s. I have 
watched Maine go from a state where murderers were rare and were front page news 
for weeks to a point that we have murders almost daily. Maine always has had high 
gun ownership and many years ago there were no restrictions on sales.  It is not the 
guns or the honest gun owners that are a problem. It is not enforcing the laws we have
against the guilty and piling on feel good laws that only affect the honest person. 
Criminals do not care about laws. If strong gun laws made a difference Chicago 
would be the safest city in America. This is simply another law that can make an 
honest person into a criminal. 
Respectfully,
Joseph Grant, Wiscasset
