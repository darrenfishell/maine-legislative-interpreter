Good afternoon Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Jonathan Martell. I am a resident of Sanford Maine, Sanford City Councilor, and Head of the 
Southern Maine Chapter of the Gun Owners of Maine. 
My testimony today is in regard to LD 22 An Act to impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons. l 
understand that this bill is in response to drug and firearms trafficking in Maine. While l believe the intent of this 
is to mirror Federal Statutes, it does not meet the same definitions. 
18 U.S. Code ยง 922 - Unlawful acts Section d already covers this issue. 
There are however several issues with this law as written. 
Firearms definition in Maine statute is different than federal for antique firearms as well as many other arms such 
as bb guns that do not fall under federal guidelines. 
Section 554-A covers sales to minors which is outside the scope of the intent of this bill. 
Section 2 language is vague and should match federal statute if that is the intent. 
This real issue here is enforcement. l know for a fact that there is an BATF branch in Portland that should be 
prosecuting trafficking across state lines. The BATF should be enforcing federal laws instead of harassing gun 
owners and local gun shops. 
Thank you for your time, 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
