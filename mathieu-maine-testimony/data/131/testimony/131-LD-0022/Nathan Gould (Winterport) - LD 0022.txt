Testimony in Opposition to LD 22
An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety :
My name is Nathan Gould. I am from Winterport. I am giving this testimony in 
opposition to LD 22, “An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons.”
Laws designed to prevent criminals from gaining access to firearms already exist
—they are already “prohibited persons”. The law proposed in LD 22 is redundant and 
does not increase safety. Those with the intent to break the law will do so, whether the 
crime be illegally acquiring the firearm or using the firearm to commit a crime.
Rather, current laws should be enforced, and law enforcement should be 
supported to that end. This bill treads too close to the precarious edge of infringing 
upon our Second Amendment rights.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass, and I thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
