LD 22
I oppose LD 22, An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons.  It 
is redundant as this bill is already Federal law (18 USC ยง 922(d). The bill focuses on 
the wrong person, i.e., the UNKNOWING seller and not the CRIMINAL buyer. This 
is back door legislation aimed at banning private firearm sales. We do not need 
another law on the books that criminals will not obey.  This bill must not become law.
