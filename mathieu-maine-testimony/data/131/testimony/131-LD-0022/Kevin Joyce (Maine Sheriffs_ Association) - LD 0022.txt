L.D. 22 - An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice, my name is Kevin Joyce. I am the Sheriff of Cumberland 
County and here on behalf of the Maine Sheriffs Association. 
Maine sheriffs met to discuss LD 22 — An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited 
Persons. 
The statistics are daunting. Mass shootings across our country in less that three months totaled 
131 as of March 28. But like any problem that seems oveiwhelming to address, we can and must 
look for areas on which we can all agree. 
Maine’s sixteen sheriffs are elected officials representing Democrats, Republicans, and 
Independents. Many ﬁrearms’ bills do not offer the potential for all parties to agree. L.D. 22, 
however, has all sheriffs in agreement that this bill makes good sense. 
Passage of L.D. 22 would not have prevented the horriﬁc loss of life that unfolded in Tennessee 
last week, but our hope is that implementing this law will cause those who plan to transfer 
ownership of ﬁrearms to pause and evaluate the repercussions for failing to ensure the recipient 
of a ﬁrearm is legally qualiﬁed to own and/or possess such a ﬁrearm. 
As we continue to look for areas that all can unite in our positions, Maine sheriffs urge members 
of this committee to unanimously support the passage of L.D. 22. I welcome any questions you 
may have. 
Sincerely, 
Sheriff Kevin Joyce 
Maine Sheriffs ’ Association
