Vote NO on LD22 "An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited 
Persons".   This places too much responsibility on the seller - the wording is quite 
ambiguous - and what is this 'permit' mentioned in the text?? Maine does not require a
'permit' to exercise our 2nd Amendment right.  And there is no shown need for this 
law.  Laws passed that aren't needed are BAD LAWS.
Thank you.
