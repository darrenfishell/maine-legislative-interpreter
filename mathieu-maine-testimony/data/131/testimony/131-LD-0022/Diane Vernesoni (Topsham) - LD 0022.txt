Topsham
LD 22
Dear Senator Beebe, Rep Salisbury and members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety committee,
My name is Diane Vernesoni and I live in Topsham.  
I would like you to reject LD 22, An Act to Impede the transfer of firearms to 
Prohibited Persons.
The definition of “prohibited persons” is way very vague and open to interpretation.  
We should not be made policemen of our fellow citizens.  We should not depend on 
the flawed judicial system, which often makes mistakes, to tell us someone shouldn’t 
be allowed a gun.  Often false accusations during heated exchanges with another 
person can lead to an unwarranted arrest which would forever keep someone from 
owning a firearm.  This he said/she said kind of situation can and does happen.  More 
times and to too many people to make this broad sweeping statement of “Prohibited 
Persons.”  Please adjust your thinking to a more palatable solution than this bill.  This 
“misidentification” can happen to anyone.  Even you.  
Thank you for your consideration.
