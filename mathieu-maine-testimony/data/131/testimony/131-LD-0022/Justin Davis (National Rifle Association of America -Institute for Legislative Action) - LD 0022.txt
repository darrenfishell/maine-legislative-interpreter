lusnrure FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION 
1 1250 WAPLES MILL ROAD 
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA 22030 
April 3, 2023 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
100 State House Station 
Augusta, ME 04333 
Dear Senator Beebe—Center, Representative Salisbury, and Honorable Members of the 
Committee: 
I am writing to you regarding Legislative Document 22 (LD 22), an act to impede the transfer of 
ﬁrearms to prohibited persons. On behalf of the National Riﬂe Association, I would like to 
express our opposition to this bill as currently written. The bill, as currently stands, creates 
confusion around the sale of ﬁrearms. 
LD 22 is a vague bill that puts Maine out of alignment with federal law regarding sales and 
transfers of ﬁrearms. The knowledge requirement in LD 22 does not clearly require that the 
seller or transferor knows that the person they are selling or transferring the ﬁrearm to is 
prohibited from possessing a ﬁrearm. This defect could make gun owners into criminals fora 
simple mistake when they had no reason to suspect there was anything unlawful about the sale of 
their ﬁrearm. 
This problem is compounded by Maine’s treatment of antique ﬁreanns as legally identical to 
modern firearms. Under federal law, antique ﬁrearms, which generally include all muzzle 
loading ﬁrearms, are not considered to be legally “firearms. ” This means that they are regularly 
sold over the counter and not subject to the same commercial sale restrictions as modern 
firearms. As currently drafted, a large retailer selling a muzzle loading ﬁrearm would violate LD 
22 if someone who is prohibited from possessing ﬁrearms purchases a ﬁrearm at their store, even 
though the retailer would have no way of determining that the person is prohibited from 
possessing ﬁrearms. 
Because of these concerns, we highly recommend that the committee opposes this bill. Please do 
not hesitate to contact me if you have additional questions or concerns. 
Sincerely, 
Justin E. Davis 
State Director, NRA-ILA
