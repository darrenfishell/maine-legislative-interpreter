Re: Testimony in Support of LD 22 An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to 
Prohibited Persons
I am a teacher at Freeport High School and the parent of children in the Westbrook 
School System. I am writing as an educator and parent to urge you to vote ought to 
pass on LD 22.
The atmosphere in school right now is heavy. News of school shootings, local threats 
online causing school closings, and taking time away from academics to teach 
students and staff how to survive an active shooter has created a sad and chaotic 
learning environment. I want to go to work and send my children to school without 
being fearful for our safety. Passing this bill would make it more difficult for folks to 
get their hands on the guns that are used in crimes like these. Please consider using 
your power to protect Maineâ€™s children and educators.
Respectfully submitted,
Jessica Najera
