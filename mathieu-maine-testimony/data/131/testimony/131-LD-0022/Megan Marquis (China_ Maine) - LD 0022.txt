LD 22
Dear Senator Carney and co-sponsors Representatives Sheehan and Doudera, 
Senators Beebe-Center and Lawrence, and the Committee on Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety. I am Megan Marquis from China, Maine and writing this letter in favor
of LD22 An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons.
As you know, this bill prohibits the sale or transfer of a firearm to a person who is 
prohibited from owning a firearm, possessing a firearm or having a firearm under that 
person's control. 
The statistics of gun deaths in the US are staggering and the numbers are steadily 
increasing. It's time we stop being reactive, when dead bodies are piling up. 
Preventative measures like this proposed bill are necessary. 
We must have common sense gun laws, and LD22 makes absolute sense. Why would 
we allow sales of guns to those prohibited to own guns? If a person has been found to 
be unstable or has a violent past, guns would likely be a danger to their family, the 
public or to themselves. 
Please vote in favor of LD22 and bring down the number of deaths by guns in Maine.
