Re: Testimony in Support of LD 22 An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to 
Prohibited Persons
We are students from Freeport High School and we are writing as student activists to 
urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 22.
As we have been watching the news and seeing how often shootings are happening 
around us, we have become more aware of the dangers that exist if prohibited people 
are put in the position of possessing firearms. 
Recently in our school, we have undergone training that is better preparing us in the 
event of an active shooter in the school. While this training is incredibly helpful, it has
revealed many long-term stresses and anxieties that arise when students are expecting 
an event like this. We want to focus on our education, but itâ€™s hard to be present in the
classroom when there is the potential of an armed invader. 
We want to support anything we can do that will decrease the chances of firearms 
falling into the wrong hands and therefore creating a dangerous situation that directly 
impacts us and puts our lives at risk. 
We are trusting you to use your power to protect the next generation. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Lily West, Evie Phelps, Margaret Whitaker, Melanie Wyman, Audrey Piltch, Abby
