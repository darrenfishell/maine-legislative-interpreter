LD 22
Esteemed committee members,
The very vague wording of LD22 leaves it open to very broad interpretation, and 
could lead to the re-classification of antique firearms, which have long been classified
differently than more modern firearms. This would put Maine gravely out of step with
federal firearms law, and lead to confusion and possible legal problems for antiques 
dealers who are simply following the same laws they've been following for decades.
I strongly urge you not to pass LD 22.
Thank you, 
Richard Smith
