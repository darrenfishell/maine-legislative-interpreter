l am here today to speak in favor of LD 22 — An Act to impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited 
Persons 
This particular bill is of special interest to me as someone who worked "in the trenches" in the world of 
domestic violence victims and survivors — both in Maine and Nationally. 
Domestic Violence offenders are in all likelihood one of the largest groups of prohibited persons as 
named in this act before you. l worked for decades to not only develop and subsequently reﬁne both the 
Maine Protection From Abuse statute, but the federal Violence Against Women Act as well. Eventually, 
both of those statutes required relinquishment of weapons when a permanent protective order was in 
place. 
Those times are particularly dangerous for victims and their children —~ and l believe as Legislators we 
have a civic and moral responsibility to keep firearms from the hands of perpetrators of domestic 
violence. 
Anything we can do to keep firearms from adjudicated — and thus prohibited domestic abusers will 
indeed save Maine lives. 
l ask you to vote to pass LD 22
