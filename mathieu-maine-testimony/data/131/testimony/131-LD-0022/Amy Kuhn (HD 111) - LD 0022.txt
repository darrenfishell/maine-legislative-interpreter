District 111: Falmouth (part) 
  
 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety.  
 
My name is Amy Kuhn and I represent the Town of Falmouth in House District 111. I am here 
today to speak in support of LD 22, 60, and 168. I appreciate your allowing me to offer 
combined testimony so that I can return to my committee.  
 
Due to the high number of communications I received from constituents on these bills, I felt 
compelled to weigh in on this important issue. Perhaps most poignantly, yesterday afternoon I 
received an email from a child, a middle school student in my town, asking that I support these 
bills to help keep his school safe.  
 
I know that you will carefully consider all the testimony you will hear today and dig deeply into 
the details of each proposal. I would ask that also you try to stay focused on a theme. At 30,000 
feet, all of these bills have one thing in common — keeping guns out of the hands of people who 
should not have them due to the risk of harm to themselves or others. 
 
We are not talking about sportsmen and women enjoying their hobby nor the many responsible 
gun owners who are keeping guns safe at home. 
 
We’re talking about kids who want to be safe at school. On behalf of our kids and our families, I 
ask that you act on their requests for safety.                   . 
 
Thank you.
