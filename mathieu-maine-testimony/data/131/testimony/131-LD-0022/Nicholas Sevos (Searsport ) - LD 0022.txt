Nicholas Sevos

LD 22
My name is Nicholas Sevos, and I am a resident of Searsport, Maine. I am a 
somewhat recent transplant to Maine, having moved up from Rhode Island in 2021 to 
escape the draconian laws imposed upon the people of that state by their so-called 
representatives; I was drawn to Maine by the spirit of independence, common sense, 
and appreciation of liberty that I had experienced on every visit and seen in Maine 
natives that I served alongside as an active duty US Army Infantryman for six years 
with two tours in Iraq. I have only recently become aware of several gun control 
proposals making their way through committee, and I would like to speak on these 
proposals; additionally for the sake of simplicity you will notice this preamble in each
piece of written testimony I submit so apologize for the partially duplicitous nature of 
my comments. 
The concept of punishing those who would knowingly and willingly provide weapons
to a "bad guy" isn't a terrible one, if that "bad guy" is bad in a way all people would 
agree, such as a child molester or mass murderer. The issue here is the potential for 
abuse of this concept. There needs to be a specific list of violations or categories of 
persons that are prohibited within the text of this bill, not just an allusion to another 
piece of legislation. Once that is done, the merits of that list can be debated.
