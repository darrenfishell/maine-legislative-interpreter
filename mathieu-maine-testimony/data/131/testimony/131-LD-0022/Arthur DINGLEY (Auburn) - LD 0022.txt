Re: Written testimony in opposition to LD 22 SP0014 and LD 168 
My name is Arthur Dingley. I am a former attorney and retired physician. I am a 
lifelong resident of Maine. I live in Auburn.
LD 22 revisits the "gun show loophole" as, I assume, a well-intentioned effort to 
minimize gun violence.  Whether Maine has an increasing problem with gun violence 
is entirely unclear.  It is at least unlikely.  Whether there are any instances of violent 
criminals buying firearms at gun shows in Maine is so unlikely as to be laughable.
The trouble with such State-level laws is that they simultaneously do nothing to 
decrease crime and convey they idea that we HAVE done something.  We MUST, as 
a nation, take on the tidal wave of gun violence.  Legislation truly intended to keep 
guns out of the hands of prohibited persons would (1) be federal, (2) apply to 
EVERYONE, not just gun-show sellers, (3) make the FBI
"no buy" list available 24-7 online, (4) require anyone transferring a firearm to any 
other person query the FBI list and retain proof of a "proceed" decision before 
transfer, and (5) be entirely free of charge.  
Please. Stop this incessant picking away around the edges of a colossal social 
problem.  It unfairly burdens law-abiding Maine citizens and accomplishes nothing 
beyond a self-righteous pat on the back. There is a national plague of gun violence 
requiring a national response.  You are voters and constituents as well as elected 
representatives of the people. Join me in demanding that Maine's federal 
Congressional delegation lead the way by sponsoring legislation made applicable to 
all with a mechanism available to all.  
Thank you for considering these remarks.
