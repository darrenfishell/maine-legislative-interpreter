ww.maineaap.orgTestimony i n suppor t of LD 22 – ‘ An Act to Im pede the Transfer o f Firearms t o 
Prohibited P erson’. 
Senator Beebe- Center,  Representative S alisbury a nd dist inguished m embers o f 
the Committee o n Criminal Justice a nd P ublic Sa fety, my name  is Dr. Dan Hale, a 
Kittery resident an d board me mber o f the Maine Cha pter of t he American 
Academy o f Pediatrics. I am wr iting i n support o f LD 22 – ‘ An Act to Impede the 
Transfer of Fir earms to Prohibited P erson ’. 
As a father,  pediatrician,  and responsible f irearm owner I s upport c ommonsense 
measures to p revent f irearm violence. T here is n o “easy” u nifying i ntervention 
that will e nd firearm violence,  but t here  are s everal measures t hat c an mo ve u s in 
the rig ht directio n of saving l ives. T hese t hree Acts s trengt hen existing l aws fo r 
safe transfer and sales of f irearms w ithout re stricting t he rights o f responsible 
Maine h unters a nd sports enthusiasts. 
There  is a lo ng h istory o f responsible f irearm ownership in M aine. Famili es have 
been hunting a nd fishing together fo r centuries. H owever,  it is also tr ue that ra tes 
of suicide are higher in h omes w ith firearms a nd inappropriate  access t o firearms 
can endanger o thers. T hese le gislative e fforts are a good balance o f protecting 
those  rights while taking real  steps t o keep weapons from those  seeking to cause 
harm. LD 22, 60 and 168 are all proposals that Maine citizens should be able to 
support.  
Thank you for keeping our communit ies safe, 
Dan Hale, M.D.,FAAP,  SFHM
