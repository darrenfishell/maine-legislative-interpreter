Amanda Schrader
Pembroke
LD 22
To the Members of the Committee On Criminal Justice and Public Safety
My name is Amanda Schrader and I am from the town of Pembroke. I am testifying in
opposition to LD168, LD60, and LD22.
Gun owners understand that criminals do not have respect for the law. Responsible 
gun owners respect the law. 
The constitution is very clear on this, gun owners rights must not be infringed upon 
no matter how large or small they may appear. It is the citizens responsibility to 
ensure that this right is upheld. This is why I am asking you to vote no on LD168, 
LD60, LD22. 
Thank you.
