Re: LD 22, An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to Prohibited Persons
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Kim Moulton. I am a taxpayer and resident of Fairfield, Maine. I am 
writing in opposition of LD 22, An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to 
Prohibited Persons.
It is already a serious crime to sell, give, transfer, or otherwise provide a firearm to a 
prohibited person - punishable by fines and 10 years in a federal prison. These 
prohibitions include felons, certain lawful and illicit drug users, unlawful foreign 
nationals, persons under current domestic violence restraining orders or having a prior
domestic violence conviction, and fugitives from justice.  
While all new laws may come with severe punitive consequences for violators, equal 
considerations must be made for potential breach of civil liberties; additional police 
work and training, and judicial expenses paid by Maine taxpayers. 
The expense and redundancy are unnecessary. It would be prudent for state and local 
law enforcement agencies to continue to refer suspected violators to the relevant 
federal agencies. 
 I urge the committee to vote Ought Not to Pass.   
Respectfully,
Kim Moulton
