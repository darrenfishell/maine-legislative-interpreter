Testimony in Opposition of LD 731
Barry W. Norris
Maine Association of Agricultural Fairs
Good afternoon Senator Hickman; Representative Brenner; Members of the 
Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee:
     My name is Barry W. Norris.  I am the Executive Director of the Maine 
Association of Agricultural Fairs.  I am here today representing the 26 Agricultural 
fairs and to speak in opposition to LD 731.  
Maine fairs rely heavily on the stipends received through the Agricultural Support 
Fund.  Should LD 731 pass, it would reduce the monies available to the fund by 
approximately $21,000. At the present 2022 5% level, the fund received $26,672. 
To go to 1%, the fund would receive approximately $5,334 using the income from 
ADW. 
This bill negatively impacts not only Maine agricultural fairs through the reduction 
to the support fund; it also negatively impacts  our Maine harness racing industry.
Thank for your time today and we urge you to vote the bill out ought not to pass.
