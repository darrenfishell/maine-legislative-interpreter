TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF LD 731 AS AMENDED 
”An Act Regarding the Licensing of Persons to Conduct Advance Deposit Wagering ” 
Good Afternoon Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and distinguished members of the Veterans 
and Legal Affairs Committee: 
My name is Peter Connell from South Portland Maine. I'm here today representing Gary Sagris, the 
owner and operator of Winners Off-Track Betting Facility in Brunswick, ME. Gary is battling with some 
health issues that prevent him from being here today. Gary is one of the nicest people I've ever met and 
he so wished to be here. He's been before this committee countless times over the years sends his 
sincerest greetings and regards. 
In Gary's words "l stand in support of LD 731 as amended. Unfortunately, due to illness, l am unable 
to attend today, so I've asked my good friend Peter Connell to present my testimony. 
The ADW bill that passed in 2016 was important to the industry. Maine didn't have Advanced Deposit 
Wagering and we were falling behind the rest of the world. We worked very hard to educate the 
legislators on this Committee about Advance Deposit Wagering and the legislature agreed that it made 
no sense let this much needed revenue to leave the State and hurt the industry. 
This amended bill will preserve the ADW revenue and likely enhance it by opening the market. Please 
support LD 731 as amended. l would be very grateful. ” 
"Thank you so much for your time and service." 
Sincerely, 
Gary Sagris
