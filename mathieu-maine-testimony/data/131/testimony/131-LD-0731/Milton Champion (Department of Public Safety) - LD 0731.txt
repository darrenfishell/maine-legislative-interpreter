Department of Public Safety 
March 8, 2023, 1:00 pm, Room 437, State House 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and Distinguished Members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee, I am Milton Champion, Executive Director of the Gambling 
Control Unit within the Department of Public Safety. l am here today on behalf of the 
Department of Public Safety to testify “Neither For Nor Against” LD 731 which is an Act 
Regarding the Licensing of Persons to Conduct Advance Deposit Wagering. 
Current law requires the Gambling Control Board to award, through a competitive bidding 
process, one bidder the privilege to be licensed to conduct advance deposit wagering. The 
current awardee, Penn ADW LLC is under contract until May 31, 2025 and is paying 
revenue due the state of 5% of gross wagers for both in state and out of state wagers. 
A similar bill, LD 1797 died in possession of the senate upon conclusion of the 129"‘ 
legislature and was placed in the legislative ﬁles on November 16, 2020. The following 
changes have been made to this bill in relation to LD 1797: 
0 Added deﬁnition of Gross advance deposit wagering income;~ 
0 Licensing of advance deposit wagering employees; 
0 Exceptions to employee licensing; 
v Removes exception that an entity that operates ADW may not receive a 
distribution of the revenue due the state; 
¢ Revenue collection of 1% of gross wagers for both in state and out of state wagers 
instead of the Board establishing by rule the net commission for distribution; 
However an amendment to this bill by the sponsor has increased the revenue percentage 
from 1% to 5% of gross wagers in line with the current revenue percentage of 5 percent. 
The Unit will have recommendations to amendments of the current bill for the work 
session in the area of deﬁnitions, background investigations, licensing exceptions,

renewal periods and that any races available shall be made available to all ADW 
licensees in the state.‘ 
This bill would have the opportunity for up to ten or more additional operators in Maine 
and an undisclosed number of employees. It would require additional staff of one Ofﬁce 
Assistant II for the Gambling Control Unit. 
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the cormnittee today, and I would be 
happy to answer any questions you may have at this time. 
Respectfully
