LD 1006 An Act to Ensure Access to Safe Drinking Water from Household Wells in Rural Areas 
by Expanding Testing 
In Support 
My name is Lucas Montgomery, and I am a student at Colby College. I am from a rural area and 
grew up with a private well and sympathize with the need for more accessible testing to keep 
well water safe. The widespread contamination of PFAS across the state is well documented and 
the state has made many strides in protecting Mainers through the banning of practices (such as 
sludging on farmland) and products (such as food packaging). However, the next step in 
protecting Mainers is to better manage the available drinking water. PFAS contaminates drinking 
water sources across the state, leading to direct ingestion of the toxic substances. Many PFAS 
have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals and there is ongoing research on their human 
effects in communities contaminated by their drinking water along the Ohio River. Private wells 
are traditionally unprotected and unregulated, but in a state with vast PFAS contamination and a 
high proportion of private well usage, it should be the responsibility of the government to 
provide the necessary information to support and protect its residents. And one of the best steps 
to ensure this protection is to provide the low-income Mainers relegated to private wells the 
opportunity to analyze their water source they wouldn’t normally be able to afford. Almost all 
Mainers already have PFAS in their bodies and this bill will help better identify the sources. We 
can’t begin to undo the damage until we know how much PFAS contamination there is.
