Rural Maine 
April 28, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Sen/ices, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the 
Maine Community Action Partnership, the membership organization of the 
ten Community Action Agencies in Maine, and we support LD 1006 An Act 
to Ensure Access to Healthy Drinking Water from Household Wells in Rural 
Maine. 
Our state’s greatest resource is our people, and our state's policies shape 
people's possibilities. ln Community Action, we create conditions that invite 
children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into the hidden 
potential in our communities. Through our \Nhole Family approach, we build 
a family’s capacity for sustained stability and economic growth. We invest in 
the family’s well-being, we let them drive their own story, and we have 
tangible success. , 
As these families fulﬁll their promise, they can run into unintended 
consequences of policies enacted in good faith, before we learned more 
about what we were using to produce everyday products and to reuse 
products as a solution to another problem. This has happened many times 
in our recent history: widely used lead paint; carcinogens in gasoline, 
cigarettes and even some preserved foods; and per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS) in sludge used to fertilize home gardens and farms. In 
each case, we did what we thought was best at the time.' 
Times change, we know more about these chemicals and their harmful 
effects. While we still use gasoline every day, we are using less and less; 
we do not smoke tobacco in public places. ln the case of PFAS, we cannot 
see it or smell it, but tested water shows it in over 380 residential drinking 
water wells in 22 Maine towns near known contamination sites; and 25 
Maine schools, impacting up to 6,650 children, from unknown sites. That 
means on the order of nearly 10,000 people, that we know of, including 
many children, are being poisoned every time they have a drink of what 
should be life afﬁrming water.7 
The cost to test your well for PFAS, if you even think about it, is about $300. 
lf you are near a known sludge spreading site, as those 380 households 
were, you may be entitled to a free water ﬁltration system from the DEP; if 
not, you are on your own to try to remediate the problem. 
LD 1006 seeks to remedy this for low-income Mainers, who do not have the 
means to test, let alone treat, their potentially contaminated wells. This 
simply adds PFAS to the list of contaminants for which DHHS already tests. 
lf you ﬁnd PFAS or other contaminants in your water, there is funding 
available from the Maine Housing Authority to help cover the cost of 
remediation.l 
Thank you for your time and attention.
