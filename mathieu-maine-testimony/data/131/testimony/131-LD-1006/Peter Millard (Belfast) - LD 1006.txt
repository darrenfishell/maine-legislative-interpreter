Drinking Water from Household Wells in Rural Areas by Expanding Testing 
 
Esteemed members of the Committee on Health and Human Services. I am a family physician 
and epidemiologist. I live in Belfast and have practiced medicine in Maine for the past 30 years. 
I am testifying on behalf of Maine Physicians for Social Responsibility.  
 
The Maine chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR)supports LD1006, a bill that aims 
to expand Maine’s low-income water test subsidy to cover PFAS. 
 
Maine PSR is an organization of health professionals who advocate for policies and practices 
that eliminate pervasive threats to the safety, security, health and well-being of the people of 
Maine and the world. 
 
PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer 
products worldwide since the 1950s. They have been linked to various health problems such as 
cancer, thyroid disease, and immune system dysfunction. 
 
Maine DEP currently provides free water filtration systems to households with wells 
contaminated with PFAS, but the cost of the test is preventing concerned Mainers from self-
testing.   
 
All Mainers should have access to clean drinking water.   
 
LD1006 is common-sense legislation which will add PFAS testing to Maine’s existing list of 
subsidized water tests for radon and arsenic, and Maine PSR supports this legislation.
