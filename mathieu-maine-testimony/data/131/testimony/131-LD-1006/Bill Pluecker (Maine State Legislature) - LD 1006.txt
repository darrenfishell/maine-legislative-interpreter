Testimony of Representative Bill Pluecker Presenting 
LD 1006, An Act to Ensure Access to Safe Drinking Water from Household Wells 
in Rural Areas by Expanding Testing 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
Friday, April 28, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee. My name is Sen. Henry Ingwersen and I represent District 32, which includes the 
York County municipalities of Arundel, Biddeford, Dayton, Hollis, and Lyman. I’m here to 
present on behalf of the bill sponsor, Rep. Bill Pluecker, L.D. 1006 “An Act to Ensure Access 
to Safe Drinking Water from Household Wells in Rural Areas by Expanding Testing, ” of 
which I am a cosponsor. 
We have all heard the stories about wells contaminated by PFAS across the state. This 
committee has heard several pieces of legislation over the past few years that have dealt with 
the issue of PFAS contamination of drinking water. Over the past 4 years we have learned a 
lot about the PFAS contamination across Maine and the signiﬁcant health risks associated 
with exposure to these “forever chemicals. ” These toxic chemicals have polluted our farmland 
and drinking water throughout the state. 
Much of the contamination across the state is due to the application of PFAS-contaminated 
sludge on farmland. For those with residential wells that are contaminated due to this sludge 
spreading, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is helping with the cost of 
testing and remediation. But sludge spreading is not the only source of contamination. Other 
sources could include AF FF ﬁreﬁghting foam, which can end up in our aquifers during 
ﬁreﬁghter training or other ﬁreﬁghter maneuvers. Leachate from landfills can pollute 
groundwater as can effluent being discharged from municipalities and industries across the 
state. PFAS is ubiquitous and highly mobile, making it easy to contaminate drinking water. 
Public water supplies in Maine and those community water sources that service schools and 
daycares will test and treat for PFAS. But many Maine households do not get their drinking 
water from public water supplies; they rely on residential wells. Maine is the state with the 
highest residential well Water use, with more than half of the population relying on Well water 
for their everyday use. With PFAS testing cost being prohibitively expensive, $250-300 fora 
DEP certiﬁed approved test, we need to make sure that everybody relying on well water can 
rest assure that they are not drinking PFAS contaminated water and impacting the health of 
their family. Currently, the state has a program that helps low-income Mainers pay for water 
testing for arsenic and other contaminants. PFAS is not included on that list of contaminants. 
LD 1488 will require the Department to add PFAS to the list of contaminants it covers the

cost of testing for when helping low-income Mainers test their wells. It is a very 
straightforward bill to provide much needed assistance to make sure that low-income 
Mainers have safe drinking water. 
Thank you.
