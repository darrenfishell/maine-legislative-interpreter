LD 1006
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human
Services
Committee. 
My name is Anson Biller from South China where I farm berries and vegetables. I am
writing in support of LD 1006 to increase rural access to testing for PFAS 
contamination. The long-term dangers of PFAS contamination of well water is 
increasingly well-known. As a state, we need to ensure that all residents have access 
to resources to test for these chemicals in their drinking supply. We know that the 
DEP's sludge map while capturing the majority is still an incomplete picture of PFAS 
contamination in our state.
Please, pass this bill to ensure that income level does not stand as a barrier to PFAS 
testing. I urge you to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1006.
Thank you,
Anson Biller
