In
support
of
ensuring
access
to
safe
drinking
water
from
household
wells
in
rural
areas
by
expanding
testing
Dear
Representative
Meyer
and
Senator
Baldacci,
My
name
is
Maddy
and
I
am
a
current
junior
at
Colby
College
majoring
in
Biology
and
Environmental
Science
with
a
concentration
in
public
health.
I
am
writing
in
support
of
LD1006
to
ensure
safe
drinking
water
in
wells
in
rural
areas
of
Maine.
For
many
communities
in
Maine,
their
only
water
supply
is
a
local
well.
W ithout
adequate
regulation
of
these
wells,
it
is
possible
that
many
people
can
be
inadvertently
harmed
by
a
single
contaminated
well
because
many
people
may
rely
on
it.
Specifically ,
it
has
become
clear
that
testing
for
perfluoroalkyl
and
polyfluoroalkyl
is
an
important
indicator
of
community
health
in
Maine.
After
a
history
of
using
contaminated
sludge
as
fertilizer
across
Maine,
the
responsibility
to
monitor
communities
falls
on
the
government.
Having
data
that
shows
the
levels
of
these
contaminants
in
the
water
will
help
inform
healthcare
decisions
and
future
water
regulations.
Rural
areas
are
particularly
vulnerable
to
harm
from
contamination
in
their
water
supply .
Their
dependence
on
private
wells
creates
an
added
importance
for
a
reliable
and
safe
water
supply .
Given
the
countless
daily
necessities
of
water ,
there
are
significant
human
health
implications
to
drinking
contaminated
water
for
extended
periods
of
time.
PF AS
chemicals
have
been
shown
to
af fect
the
endocrine
system
when
present
in
small
amounts
in
the
human
body .
The
EP A
has
proposed
to
set
the
maximum
contamination
level
for
PFOA
and
PFOS
to
4
ppt
for
public
water
supplies.
However ,
without
monitoring
private
wells,
this
leaves
a
significant
population
out
of
this
regulation
and
at
an
increased
risk.
Since
rural
wells
are
private
and
may
not
be
regularly
monitored,
it
is
crucial
to
expand
funding
to
monitor
PF AS
in
rural
wells.
Everyone
deserves
to
have
access
to
safe
drinking
water
without
having
to
worry
about
exposure
to
excessive
amounts
of
harmful
chemicals.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
