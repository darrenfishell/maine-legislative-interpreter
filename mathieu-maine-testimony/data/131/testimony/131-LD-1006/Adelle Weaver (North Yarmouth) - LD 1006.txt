Testimony of Adele Weaver, North Yarmouth, ME 
In SUPPORT of LD 1006, "An Act to Ensure Access to Healthy Drinking Water from 
Household Wells in Rural Maine 
Before the Health and Human Services Committee 
April 28th, 2023 
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee.  My name is Adele Weaver.  I am a graduating senior at Greeley High 
School in Cumberland, and will be heading to college in Maine in the Fall.  Please accept this 
testimony in support of LD 1006, which would help expand access to clean drinking water to 
low income Mainers. 
This year, I was part of the Greely Solve for Tomorrow STEM competition team where 
we were State Champions, working to address the nationwide PFAS crisis. We have worked with 
PFAS researchers at the University of Maine, Orono (Dr. Apul and Dr. Chardhoury), who are 
experts in this field and provided us with crucial information which led to a deeper 
understanding of the issue. We also met with ECT2, a company at the forefront of remediating 
PFAS contamination around the country and world.  
 
 LD1006 would afford low income Mainers with the ability to test their drinking water for 
PFAS contamination. This is extremely valuable because the price of testing for PFAS is often as 
expensive as $500. This bill levels the playing field and helps address socioeconomic 
disadvantages which will ensure a healthier Maine.  
 
I hope you consider the impact of this bill on future generations and do what is right for 
the citizens of Maine.   I urge you to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1006. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Adele Weaver 
North Yarmouth, ME
