RE:
LD1006
Mr .
Baldacci
and
Ms.
Meyer
and
committee,
My
name
is
Camille
Porteous,
and
I
am
a
sophomore
at
Colby
College
in
W aterville
studying
biology
and
environmental
science
with
a
specific
interest
in
public
health.
I
am
advocating
in
support
of
Maine
LD1006:
“An
Act
to
Ensure
Safe
Drinking
W ater
from
Household
W ells
in
Rural
Areas
by
Expanding
T esting”.
I
am
a
firm
believer
that
you
should
be
able
to
know
what
you
are
consuming.
W ater
is
so
vital
to
our
health
and
we
consume
so
much
water
everyday ,
that
contaminated
or
unsafe
water
has
extreme
ramifications
for
our
health
and
safety .
Further ,
technology
to
test
water
already
exists
and
is
readily
available,
but
insuf ficient
funding
and
awareness
has
allowed
issues
of
unsafe
water
to
arise
in
Maine.
Fairfield,
a
town
very
close
to
my
home
in
W aterville,
has
been
shown
to
be
highly
contaminated
with
PF AS,
an
extremely
toxic
“forever
chemical”
that
has
been
shown
to
be
carcinogenic
and
linked
to
immune
deficiencies.
Recently
found
contaminations
east
and
southwest
of
Fairfield
show
that
we
are
just
beginning
to
understand
the
potential
for
widespread
water
well
contamination
of
PF AS.
Maine
has
been
a
national
leader
on
PF AS
standards
and
regulation,
but
even
more
people
will
benefit
from
these
protections
if
they
actually
know
what
is
in
their
water .
Even
with
the
ban
on
sludge
spreading,
the
legacy
of
PF AS
in
Maine’ s
soil
and
groundwater
will
remain
a
problem
for
decades.
Everyone
has
a
right
to
clean
water .
Everyone
has
a
right
to
know
what
they
are
drinking,
and
if
they
are
inadvertently
putting
themselves
at
risk
every
time
they
have
a
sip
of
water ,
eat
freshly
washed
vegetables,
or
take
a
shower .
So,
I
ur ge
you
to
take
action
to
support
LD1006.
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
time
and
consideration!
