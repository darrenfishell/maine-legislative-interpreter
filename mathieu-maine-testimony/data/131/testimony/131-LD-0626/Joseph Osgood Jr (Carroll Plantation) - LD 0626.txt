          
Neither For/Nor Against LD 626 and 1241
Senator Lafountain, Representative Landry and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, My name Joe Osgood Jr. I am the owner of the FBM Maine 
Outdoor Journal YouTube channel.  One of the primary pillars of FBM is hunter recruitment through 
youth opportunities. Although these bills would create more opportunities for Maine youth to hunt in 
Maine, the fallout for those opposed to it may create a net loss of hunting opportunities for hunters as a
whole.  I am concerned that implementing any Sunday hunting legislation would negatively affect land 
access for other hunters, including youths. 
Thank You,
Joe Osgood Jr.
