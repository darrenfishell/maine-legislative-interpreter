LD 626
Bill LD 626 is a just another deceptive way to allow hunting in Maine of Sundays. 
Why should youth learn that it’s ok to hunt on Sundays when hunting is prohibited on
Sundays to everyone? Shouldn’t youth be hunting with an adult so they learn to be 
responsible? Have youth hunt Monday through Saturday like every other responsible 
hunter.   As a hiker and woodlot owner I am opposed to ALL hunting in Maine on 
Sundays.  We need at least one day a week when we can hike and use our woodlot 
without the fear of being shot.  I am opposed to LD 626.  The constant barrage of bills
to support hunting on Sundays is why I will post my woodlot as a no hunting area (no 
hunting any day of the week).  Of course, bullets do not recognize property lines.  
This means Sunday is still my only safe day to be in the woods as long as Maine 
respects no hunting on Sunday.
