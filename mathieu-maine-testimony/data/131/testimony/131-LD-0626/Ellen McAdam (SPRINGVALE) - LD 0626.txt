McDougal Orchards is opposed to any and all proposals to open public and/or private 
lands to unrestricted Sunday (i.e. not by special permit) hunting.  We have around 250
acres of woodland surrounding our apple orchards and are happy to have hunters here 
during hunting season, preferably with permission, to help reduce the deer population.
The rest of the year, our property is open for soft recreation (non-motorized.)  Our 
orchards are mostly fenced, but anything outside the fence gets a severe deer pruning 
every year.  We could offer Sunday hunting here, by permit, if deer affected our 
ability to grow a crop.  Not every farm in Maine is fenced. If a person would like to 
hunt on Sunday, talk to a farmer with deer issues and get a depredation permit.
