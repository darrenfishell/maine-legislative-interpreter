Sunday Hunting
April 6, 2023
We have a 100 ac woodlot behind our house in Milford.  I have about six neighbors 
that hunt on the property and they have three tree stands on the property.  I am 
opposed to Sunday hunting.  It is the only day I feel safe to walk around my own land 
during hunting season.  If Sunday hunting is allowed, I will post my land for all 
recreational activities, including hunting, ATV’s, and snowmobiles.
As a side note – We have a small herd of deer that frequent our house year round.  We
enjoy watching the little ones grow and mature throughout the year.  My wife is 
adamantly opposed to hunting in general and nothing would make her happier than 
for us to post our land.  So if you want to make her happy, allow Sunday hunting.
