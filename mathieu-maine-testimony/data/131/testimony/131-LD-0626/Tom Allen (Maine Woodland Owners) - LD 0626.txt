Testimony of Tom Allen before the House IFW Committee in opposition to LD 626, 
672, 1166 and 1241 
Monday, April 10, 2023 
Chair LaFountain, Chair Landry, and Members of the Committee, 
My name is Tom Allen. I am the incoming chair (in May) of the Maine Woodland 
Owners board. l have lived almost all my life in Portland, but for over 70 years my 
family has owned an old farm and woodlands, now over 150 acres, in Sebago. 
That's why I have been a member of Maine Woodland Owners for decades. 
I am here to testify against four bills pushing for some form of Sunday hunting. As 
you have heard many times, most productive hunting areas in Maine are privately 
owned and not posted. We have never posted our forest land and do not want to 
do so. But I walk in our woods mostly on Saturday and Sunday and I understand 
why an overwhelming majority of our members object to Sunday hunting of any 
kind on their property. 
These four bills aim to crack the door open to Sunday hunting, either for youth, or 
for landowners on their own land, or with bow and arrow or crossbow. But the 
State-wide poll on Sunday hunting by the Department last year shows that even 
these narrow approaches are strongly opposed by landowners, by the public, and 
even by hunters. 
Most hunters understand that Landowner Sundays are the price they pay for 
hunting on land that could easily be posted. ln Southern l\/laine over the last few 
decades, l have noticed more and more forest land being posted. I believe 
passage of any of these bills is likely to accelerate that trend. 
Everything I have said applies also to LD 672. l urge this committee to vote "ought 
not to pass" on each of these bills. Thank you for your time and attention.
