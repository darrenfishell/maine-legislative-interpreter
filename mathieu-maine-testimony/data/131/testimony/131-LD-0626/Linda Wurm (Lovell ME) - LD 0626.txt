I am co-owner of 100acres of woodland in Stow Maine. Currently, public access, 
including hunting is allowed. 
If Sunday hunting becomes allowed, this property will be posted against public use. 
Many individuals hunt bird and deer, walk the created trails, or use snow machines 
and ATVs on this acreage. Historic use of this property has been allowed and posting 
would be a loss for many people.
I am firmly against allowing any hunting on Sunday.
