To whom it may concern: 
My name is David Probert, co-chair of the Stewardship Committee for the 
Pownalborough Court House in Dresden, Maine, one of three historic 
properties owned and maintained by the Lincoln County Historical 
Association (LCHA). 
The Pownalborough Court House offers 150 acres, including 3 miles of 
hiking trails open to the public in all seasons, 1/2 mile of which is 
accessible trail. A trail usage monitoring system tracks the number of 
people using the trail all year long. 
In 2022, an average of 340 people used the trails monthly. In the month of 
November, the height of hunting with firearms, the average per day was 5, 
except for Sundays, which was 15 per day. This indicates that people 
prefer using the trails when no hunting is allowed. 
Currently the land is not posted, although the Stewardship Committee and 
the LCHA Board of Trustees have seriously considered posting the land. 
We have seven different land abutters and some hunters use the trail 
system to reach their spots that may be on someone else’s land. 
I have agreed to post this land for NO HUNTING if hunting on Sunday, of 
any type, becomes law. 
l am also a member of the Maine Woodland Owners and have 24 prime 
hunting acres in Franklin County. We have a small camp on this land and 
enjoy going to camp in the fall and feel comfortable walking the woodlot 
on Sundays, but, again, if hunting on Sunday, of any type, becomes law,l 
will be forced to post the land for NO HUNTING. 
Respectfully, Dave Probert
