I am a private landowner of a 100 acre wood lot in Stow, Oxford county. We actively 
use our land and have opened it up to the local land trust for hiking and educational 
activities. On Saturdays neighbors and local hunters use the land. Sunday hunting in 
any form would force us to post the land and deprive all hunting activity. This is not 
in the best interest of oor communities.
