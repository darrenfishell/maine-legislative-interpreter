I am writing to oppose LD 626 which is yet another attempt of more than 39 failed 
ones in the last 45 years to pass some form of Sunday hunting in Maine. It’s a 
foot-in-the door approach to allow a practice that has been soundly rejected in the 
past, a message that by now should be abundantly clear. 
 Maine Woodland Owners, for instance, owns more than more than 7000 acres of land
and has always always supported hunting – but they have always opposed Sunday 
hunting. In fact, the more than 7,000 acres of woodland this organization owns is 
intentionally kept open to hunting. But they  have always opposed Sunday hunting. 
Why? Sunday is the one day many woodland owners and non hunting recreationists 
get to fully enjoy their land. As MWO states, “The very same woodland owners and 
farmers who provide the majority of access for the 14,000 miles of snowmobile trails 
and 7,000 miles of ATV trails in Maine are the same ones who oppose Sunday 
hunting and would restrict access for all uses if Sunday hunting is allowed.”
Other landowners share that view.  They allow hunting but are opposed to Sunday 
hunting.  If LD 626 passes, landowners will be denied the one day of the week when 
they can enjoy their property in safety. The result will be more posted land and fewer 
hunting opportunities.
