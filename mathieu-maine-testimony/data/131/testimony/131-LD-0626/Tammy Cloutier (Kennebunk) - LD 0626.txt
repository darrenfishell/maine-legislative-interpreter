Please oppose LD 626 An Act to Preserve Maine's Sporting Heritage and Enhance 
Sporting Opportunities for Maine's Youth by Allowing Maine Youth to Hunt on 
Sunday. 
How many times must Maine citizens explicitly state that they do NOT want to allow 
hunting on Sundays? The Sunday hunting ban has been in place since the 1880s, and 
despite multiple attempts to overturn it, Mainers continue to uphold the ban. 
Introducing yet another bill with the words “preserving Maine’s sporting heritage” 
and “Maine’s youth” does nothing to hide the fact that this is another attempt by a 
minority to find a “back door” into allowing Sunday hunting for what appears to be 
one purpose, and then using that foothold to expand on an activity that Maine citizens 
DO NOT WANT. In fact, in a 2021 survey by the IFW, the MAJORITY OPPOSED 
Sunday hunting. Overturning the Sunday hunting ban also does not make sense due to
the ongoing trend of an overall decline in hunting.
