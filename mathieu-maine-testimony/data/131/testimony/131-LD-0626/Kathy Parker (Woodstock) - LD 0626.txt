Woodland owners and farmers provide 95% of Maine's hunting lands and receive no 
benefit for doing so.  Woodland owners and farmers are also the ones most opposed 
to Sunday hunting.  Hunting is open 313 days a year, and unlike in many other states 
hunters are not required to get landowner permission to access land for hunting or pay
the landowners for the right to hunt.  
 
Landowners deserve one day a week to fully enjoy their woods.
Please vote to prevent Sunday Hunting in Maine.  If Sunday hunting is passed, I, as 
well as many other landowners, will close my land to the public.
