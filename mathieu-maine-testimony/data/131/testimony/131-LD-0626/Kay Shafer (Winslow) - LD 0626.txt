LD 626
I am testifying in opposition to all 3 of these bills - LD 626, LD 1166 and LD 1241.  
As a landowner and someone who moved to a rural area intentionally, I treasure quiet 
Sundays with no sound of gunfire.  There should be at least one day of rest, for both 
humans and animals.  It is not so very difficult to hunt on Saturday or find a few hours
during the week to hunt.  Sunday hunting is simply not needed, whether the hunters 
are seeking food or sport.  And as a voter I am tired of constantly having the rights of 
hunters and gun owners rammed down my throat.  I have rights, too, and I want at 
least one day of the week without the sounds of guns blasting.  I enjoy the wildlife.  I 
can exercise my right to do that without demanding hunters give up any rights they 
currently have - why can't they do the same?
