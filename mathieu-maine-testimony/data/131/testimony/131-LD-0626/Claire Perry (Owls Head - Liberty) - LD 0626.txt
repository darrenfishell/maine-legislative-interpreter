Dear IF&W Committee Members:
My name is Claire Perry - Lifetime Maine resident/ Hunter 
Writing in opposition to: 626 -An Act to Preserve Maine's Sporting Heritage and 
Enhance Sporting Opportunities for Maine's Youth by Allowing Maine's Youth to 
Hunt on Sunday
Well.  That's quite a mouth-full, isn't it ?
 No Hunting on Sunday is a Maine Sporting Heritage that the majority of Maine 
people support.
If there isn't science to back up a proposal...what is left ?  Public opinion I guess.  And
the public does not support Sunday Hunting. 
Thank you.
