I would like to say for the record, again, that as one who lives near land often 
accessed by hunters, I oppose ANY and ALL hunting on Sundays.  I have been in the 
forests when guns are shot, and they sound very close.  I have been walking in the 
forests and cross path with a hunter at his perch. Unnerving. Despite having houses in 
the visible vicinity, there are still hunters in the area.  Even from my home I hear guns
fired. The local police say homeowners are allowed to 'protect' their property from the
wildlife. Hunting is allowed in the local town Land Trusts.  The trail makers were 
making trails one day, avoiding certain sections of the forest for the wildlife; I asked 
which wildlife in particular, because according to list of allowable game....they are all
hunted...some all year round!!??  How about saving one day of the week for 
recreational users who are not killing.
