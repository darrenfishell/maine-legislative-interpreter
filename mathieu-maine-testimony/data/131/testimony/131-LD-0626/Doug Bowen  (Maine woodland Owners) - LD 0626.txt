Doug Bowen 
Maine woodland Owners
LD 626
I'm Doug Bowen and I live in Porter, Maine, in southern Oxford County. I don't hunt, 
but even so, for the past 30 years I've granted the privilege for all to hunt on my 3 
woodlots.
Why I oppose LD 626: I do hands-on work on my lots nearly all year around. During 
hunting season that's meant Sundays only. Much of my work, pruning and planting 
seedlings is quiet, so hunters would not hear me. I'd have to stop that if either this bill 
or the others are enacted.
 I also resent my generosity being disregarded by yearly demands by outside groups 
to end a generations long statute that in exchange for no Sunday hunting allows 
hunting without permission required every other day.
Already in my region of Maine, more and more woodland owners are posting their 
land. If LD 626, 1166 or 1241 is enacted, many more will. I will also post mine.
You who propose this legislation and you on this committee who support it should 
realize that you are pushing the envelope too much. If you don't want Maine to turn 
out like NH or Mass where everything's posted, you will withdraw these bills. Thank 
You
