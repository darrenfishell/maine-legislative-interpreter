To the Joint Legislative Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife in the 131st First Session
Against LD 626 to Establish Youth Deer Hunting Weekend 
Honorable Members of the IF&W Committee, Chairs Senator LaFountain and Representative 
Landry. My name is Stuart H. Reese. I am having my forester write on behalf of myself and 
Elizabeth G. Reese, my wife, owners of approximately 2.500 acres of Maine forest land. We 
allow managed hunting on some of the properties. 
Because this bill allows Sunday hunting by the inexperienced youth class of hunters on 
ALL Sundays through the entire year without limit it is unacceptable.
Thank you for your consideration and for your public service,
Signed on behalf of and at the request of Stuart H. Reese and Elizabeth G. Reese
D. Gordon Mott, Maine Forester #772
