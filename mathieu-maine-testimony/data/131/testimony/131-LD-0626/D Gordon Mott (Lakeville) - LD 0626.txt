Testimony of D. Gordon Mott 
To the Joint Legislative Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife in the 131st First Session
Against LD 626 to Establish Youth Deer Hunting Weekend 
Honorable Members of the IF&W Committee, Chairs Senator LaFountain and Representative 
Landry. My name is D. Gordon Mott. I am a private landowner in Lakeville, Penobscot County. 
Because this bill allows Sunday hunting by the youth class of hunters on ALL private lands
with landowner permission in the State, and because this bill does not limit Sunday hunting to the 
ordinary fall seasons for birds, deer and moose but it allows Sunday hunting day and night for 
coyotes nine months of the year and then for all species in the day for the rest of the year it is 
unacceptable.
Only when a rational proposal for Sunday hunting over a limited period of time is brought 
forward, combined with a requirement for hunters to get landowners’ permission, would I 
consider any change from Maine’s bar to Sunday hunting.
Thank you for your consideration and for your public service,
