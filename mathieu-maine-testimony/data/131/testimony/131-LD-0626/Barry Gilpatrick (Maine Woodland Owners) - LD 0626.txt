LD 626
Regarding acts LD626, LD672, LD1166, and LD1241, please prevent any form of 
Sunday hunting in Maine to preserve the ability of landowners to utilize their property
unencumbered for 1 day of the week.  My ancestors lived and hunted in Maine and 
did not advocate for allowing hunting on Sunday.
Respectfully,
Barry Gilpatrick
Maine Washington county landowner
