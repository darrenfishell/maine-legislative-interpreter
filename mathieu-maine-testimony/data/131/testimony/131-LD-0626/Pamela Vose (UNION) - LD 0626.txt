LD 626

TO: Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident and landowner in the town of Union.  
I am submitting testimony against LD 626   An Act to Preserve Maine's Sporting 
Heritage and Enhance Sporting Opportunities for Maine's Youth by Allowing Maine's
Youth to Hunt on Sunday
I would like to start out by saying that I am not anti-hunting and appreciate the 
traditions of hunting passed on by generations in my family.  One of these traditions 
in NO SUNDAY HUNTING.  
I speak as a taxpaying citizen and landowner who appreciates, uses and has a need to 
be in the woods during deer hunting season and finds the ever-expanding firearms 
season to be a concern and an infringement on my ability to use my property as I see 
fit.    There are many of us who have other valid reasons to be out in our beautiful 
Maine woods during the fall and cannot do so safely during deer hunting season.  We 
are as important as hunters and deserve consideration.
 
I have a question for everyone who continues to push for Sunday hunting.   When is 
enough, enough?   
If you want to see posted land and hunting by written permission only in your future, I
encourage you to keep pursuing your own selfish campaign to deny the rest of us the 
right to enjoy one day a week safely in our woods during your very generous hunting 
season.   ENOUGH.
Please vote Ought Not to Pass on this bill.
