LD 626
I own over one thousand acres of land, part of which includes an equestrian facility. I 
have never posted or restricted hunting on my property because I did not feel that 
doing so was "the Maine way." However, Maine has never allowed hunting on 
Sunday, and if LD 626 passes, I will be forced to protect my equestrian customers, 
and others whom we allow to enjoy our property in various ways by allowng them to 
enjoy THEIR passion without fear of being in danger, by posting my property against 
hunting.
