In late February, 2021 inthe middle of the pandemic, fishermen and seafood companies coastwise were 
shocked" to learn that the Poole_Fan1ily had decided to sell Union Wharf in Portland Harbor. The Pooles 
hadowned and invested in Union Wharf for five generations over 163 years. As a result, Union Wharf 
was the best maintained and most desirable working wharf in the Harbor. To everyone ’s horror, the 27 
businesses on the Wharf, 75% of which are fishing, seafood, and maritime businesses that support our 
seafood supply chain along our entire coast, were faced with the specter of losing the Wharf to one of the 
four speculative developers who ultimately submitted bids to buy the Wharf. 
Fortunately, a ﬁfth bidder, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI), found a way to engage the Poole 
Family, make a competitive offer, and after nine months of complicated negotiations, acquire Union 
Wharf to protect it as the heart of Portland ’s working waterfront. 
GMRI approached thepurchase and protection of Union Wharf the same way people approach buying and 
protecting a working forest or a working farm. They found a bank, Farm Credit, willing tomakea 
mortgage loan because they understood the value of a working wharf. They musteredi a small group of 
supporters to lend the cash.required by the bank in order to provide a moitgageiloan. They assembled 
$12,780,000 and moved , decisively ’ to protect Union Wharf from developers attracted by the Wharf’ sI 
potential as a site for a high-priced hotel;;and white-collar office development. '
‘' 
In the course of doing their diligence to complete their purchase of Union Wharf, GMRI secured the moral 
support of the Department of Marine Resources Commissioner, as well as other local and state leaders. 
GMRI was encouraged to submit a proposal tothe Land for Maine’s Future’s (LMF) Working Waterfront 
Access Protection Program, which they did in early 2022. LMF lacked the funds to offset the loss in value 
of a working Waterfront covenant on a wharf the size and value of Union Wharf. Moreover, LMF’s 
waterfront covenant is too narrow to accommodate the variety of maritime businesses based on Union 
Wharf. As a result, GMRI approached me to assist in crafting a funding mechanism to protect UnionI 
Wharf as a workingwharf in perpetuity. .

_ LD 1480 would provide $4,000,000 .to offsetthe loss;in appraised value that would result from-a working 0 
wharf covenant placed on Union Wharf. State funds would be used to pay down the loans on Union Wharf 
that are guaranteed by the appraised value of the wharf. The result would ‘be one of the State of Maine’s 
premier working, wharves being protected forever. .V
_ 
Over the past 20 years‘ , we have all watched GMRI articulate a vision to serve the State of Maine’s marine 
research, science literacy, wild and farmed ﬁshery development, and climate adaptation needs. They have 
used occasional state capital funding to leverage federal research grants, foundation and corporate support, 
and individual philanthropic support _to address our research needs and provide science educationS 
opportunities to middle school students and teachers all over Maine, free of charge. Their initiative to save 
and steward Union Wharf is just one example of their commitment to communities all over Maine. T 
I urge you to join me and my fellow sponsors to approve LD 1480,. “An Act I0 Protect Union Wharf and 
Sustain Maine ‘s Maritime Industries.” . ''
