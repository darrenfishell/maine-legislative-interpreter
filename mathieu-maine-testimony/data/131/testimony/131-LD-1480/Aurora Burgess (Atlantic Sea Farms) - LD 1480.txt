Senator

Representative

Honorable
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Appropriations
and
Financial 
Affairs:
We
at
Atlantic
Sea
Farms
support
LD
1480
“An
Act
to
Protect
Union
Wharf
and
Sustain
Maine’s
Maritime
Industries”
and
those 
working
to
protect,
preserve,
and
maintain
working
waterfront
in
Maine.
Atlantic
Sea
Farms
is
based
in
Biddeford.
Our
founders
created
the
first
commercially
viable
seaweed
farm
in
the
United
States
in 
2009,
with
the
goal
of
diversifying
how
our
coastal
waters
are
used
and
providing
a
domestic,
fresh,
healthy
alternative
to
imported 
seaweed
products.
Today
we
work
with
30
partner
farmers
–
the
vast
majority
of
whom
are
fishermen
looking
to
diversify
their 
income
stream
in
the
face
of
climate
change
–
to
grow
kelp
in
their
lobster
off-season.
Eleven
of
those
partner
farmers
land
their
kelp 
in
Casco
Bay
and
account
for
more
than
half
of
our
annual
line-grown
kelp
harvest.
In
2022,
Atlantic
Sea
Farms
constituted
more
than 
90%
of
all
of
the
line-grown
kelp
landed
in
Maine
and
our
partner
farmers
are
leading
the
charge
in
climate-change
adaptation
and 
mitigation
through
growing
kelp.
Maine
has
3,500
miles
of
coastline,
but
only
about
20
miles
of
that
shoreline
is
devoted
to
working
waterfront
that
serves
commercial 
fishing,
aquaculture,
and
associated
maritime-based
businesses.
Pressure
from
increased
coastal
development
and
climate
change
are 
rapidly
diminishing
ocean
access
for
those
who
make
their
livelihoods
on
the
water.
Fishermen
and
farmers
along
the
entire
coast
of 
Maine
struggle
to
find
well-maintained
working
waterfront
with
the
infrastructure,
such
as
the
fuel,
ice,
load-rated
hoists,
and
storage, 
needed
to
effectively
run
their
businesses.
When
Atlantic
Sea
Farms
was
working
to
expand
its
operations
two
years
ago
we
landed
in 
Biddeford,
more
than
two
miles
from
the
ocean,
because
we
were
unable
to
find
adequate
and
affordable
wharf
and
processing
space 
in
Portland.
There
is
a
critical
need
to
maintain
the
20
miles
of
working
waterfront
we
have
left
on
our
coast
and
to
support
those,
such 
as
GMRI,
working
to
preserve
these
sites.
Despite
Portland
being
surrounded
by
the
ocean
and
working
boats,
there
are
incredibly
few
facilities
that
industry
can
rely
on.
Union 
Wharf
is
one
of
only
a
few
wharfs
left
in
Portland
that
remains
accessible
to
the
working
waterfront.
It
offers
a
growing
industry
like 
ours
the
potential
of
leasing
a
berth,
laydown
space,
and
using
important
landing
facilities
for
fishermen
and
farmers.
At
a
time
when 
our
valuable
working
waterfronts
are
disappearing
at
an
alarming
rate,
we
are
deeply
appreciative
of
GMRI’s
efforts
to
preserve
Union 
Wharf
as
a
working
wharf
and
to
protect
the
wharf
from
future
development
pressure
to
ensure
that
wild
and
farmed
seafood
have
a 
place
in
Portland
Harbor
forever.
If
they
had
not
stepped
up
we
believe
that
these
important
pieces
of
real
estate
would
have
been
lost 
as
working
waterfront
forever.
Please
support
GMRI’s
effort
to
protect
Union
Wharf
and
help
ensure
that
Maine
continues
to
have
a
reliable
working
waterfront.
Sincerely,
Aurora
Burgess 
Seaweed
Aquaculture
Coordinator,
