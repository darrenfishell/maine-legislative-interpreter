Senator
Rotundo,
Representative
Sachs,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Appropriations
and
Financial
Af fairs:
I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portland’ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
Support
of
LD
1480,
An
Act
to
Pr otect
Union
Wharf
and
Sustain
Maine's
Maritime
Industries
.
For
nearly
40
years,
the
City
of
Portland
has
strived
to
preserve
a
working
waterfront
in
the
center
of
Maine’ s
lar gest
municipality .
Through
innovative
land
use
regulations,
tax
increment
financing,
collaborations
with
public
and
private
entities,
and
direct
municipal
investment
in
infrastructure,
the
City
has
maintained
an
active
and
vital
port
despite
dramatic
challenges.
Increases
in
coastal
property
values,
development
pressures,
climate
change,
and
disruptions
to
traditional
fisheries
are
day-to-day
and
long
term
threats
to
the
viability
of
the
working
waterfront.
Most
of
Portland’ s
waterfront
is
privately
owned,
and
the
waterfront’ s
pier
owners
and
property
managers
have
been
and
remain
critical
partners
in
this
ef fort.
Since
their
arrival
on
the
Portland
waterfront
over
20
years
ago,
the
Gulf
of
Maine
Research
Institute
(GMRI)
has
partnered
in
ef forts
to
preserve
the
businesses
and
properties
that
define
our
working
waterfront.
Their
stewardship
became
even
more
important
since
their
acquisition
of
Union
Wharf.
Union
Wharf
holds
a
unique
place
on
the
Portland
W aterfront.
Union
Wharf
is
the
lar gest
privately-owned
commercial
pier
in
the
Central
W aterfront;
home
to
more
commercial
marine
businesses
than
any
other
private
pier
in
Portland
Harbor;
designed
and
maintained
to
support
both
traditional
and
emer ging
marine
industries;
and
centrally
located
adjacent
to
the
Portland
Fish
Pier ,
creating
a
critical
mass
of
protected
marine
properties
in
the
heart
of
the
harbor
and
the
City .

In
short,
Union
Wharf
is
critical
private
infrastructure
for
the
marine
economy
and
its
continued
commitment
to
fisheries
and
emer ging
marine
uses
has
regional
significance.
GMRI’ s
commitment
to
preserve
marine
industrial
access
is
a
remarkable
achievement
in
the
face
of
extraordinary
development
pressures
and
escalating
coastal
property
values.
Please
support
LD
1480
to
help
ensure
that
future
generations
of
Mainers
will
have
access
to
marine
opportunities
in
Portland
Harbor .
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
