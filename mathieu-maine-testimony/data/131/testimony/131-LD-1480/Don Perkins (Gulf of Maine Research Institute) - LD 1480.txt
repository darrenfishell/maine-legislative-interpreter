Re: L.D. 1480: An Act to Protect Union Wharf and Sustain Maine’s Maritime 
Industries 
Dear Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and Members of the Committee: 
My name is Don Perkins. I serve as the P-resident/CEO of the Gulf of Maine 
Research Institute (GMRI) and reside in Cape Elizabeth. I am writing to ask for 
your support of L.D. I480: An Act to Protect Union Wharf and Sustain Maine 's 
Maritime Industries. 
Background: 
Po1tland ’s working waterfront community was shocked to leam in early March, 
2021 that the Poole Family, who had owned and stewarded Union Wharf for 163 
years, had decided to sell Union Wharf. Two ﬁshing community leaders approached 
GMRI to request our assistance in ﬁnding apotential buyer Who would protect 
Union Wharf as a working wharf 
GMRI reached out to 35+ ﬁshing community, Waterfront, real estate, City, State, and 
community organization leaders to determine whether any potential working 
waterfront- ﬁiendly buyer could be identiﬁed. No such potential buyer was 
identiﬁed. In the absence of such a buyer, GMRI decided to pursue purchasing and Gulf of Ma|ne

protecting Union Wharf as a working wharf, consistent with our waterfront access strategy 
adopted in January 2021. 
GMRI was one of ﬁve bidders who submitted offers to the Poole Family by the deadline of April 
30, 2021. We were the only bidder who was not a developer. We were the only bidder with 
experience owning, operating, and maintaining a working wharf. We were not the high bidder, 
but we were selected by the Poole Family as their successor owner because we offered a fair 
price and have a demonstrated commitment to the working waterfront. 
After eight months of negotiations and due diligence, GMRI acquired Union VVharf from the 
Poole Family in late December 28, 2021 for $12,350,000, which was $95,000 less than our 
mortgage bank’s appraisal of $12,445,000. During our 16 months of ownership of Union Wharf 
since then, we have assumed operation of the wharf without complications, provided ﬁshing 
vessels with affordable berthing, replaced non-maritime tenants with maritime tenants as non- 
maritime leases have expired, maintained the wharf, and planned long-term improvements. 
Union Wharf is comprised of 5.8 acres of wharf and 1.2 acres of submerged lands rights. The 
wharf and its 10 buildings provide 1,500 linear feet of vessel berthing and 50,487 square feet of 
processing, warehouse, and ofﬁce space for 29 tenants, including 11 ﬁshing vessels.

Union Wharf Ownership: 
GMRI incorporated Union Wharf, LLC as a wholly-owned subsidiary structured to own 
and operate Union Wharf and to separate the Wharf operations from GMRl’s program 
ﬁnances and real estate on Wright’s Wharf. GMRI is and will continue to be the sole 
owner and single member of Union Wharf, LLC. Union Wharf, LLC pays property taxes 
and income taxes. 
Acquisition Financing: 
GMRI assembled the following funding sources to acquire and protect Union Wharf: 
Sources of Funds to Purchase Union Wharf: 
Farm Credit Variable Rate Loan $ 5,517,500 
Farm Credit Fixed Rate Loan 4,362,500 
Individual Lender Fixed Rate Loans 2,900,000 
Total Borrowed $ l2,780,000 
Use of Proceeds: 
Purchase of Union Wharf $ 12,350,000 
Emergency Reserve Fund 430,000 
Total $ 12,780,000 
Working Waterfront Covenant and Restrictions Provided by L.D. 1480: 
L.D. I480 would provide GMRI with $4,000,000 to compensate for the loss in value, 
based on a qualified, independent real estate appraisal, resulting from restricting the uses 
of Union Wharf in Portland Harbor to commercial ﬁshing, aquaculture, seafood 
processing,_piloting, marine salvage, marine hazard response, marine construction, 
marine operations, marine research and development, marine exploration and other 
marine dependent and marine related industries or similar uses that may emerge over 
tigr_e_. A minimum of 35% of the linear feet designated by the Gulf of Maine Research 
Institute for vessel berthing at Union Wharf must be allocated to berth commercial 
ﬁshing vessels and aquaculture vessels if there is demand. The restrictions must be set 
forth in a recorded declaration of covenants and restrictions encumbering Union Wharf. 
The restrictions will be monitored and enforced by the Department of Administrative and 
Financial Services or an independent conservation trust or working waterfront trust 
approved by the State. 
Use of Funds Provided by L.D. 1480: 
Given that GMRI’s Farm Credit mortgage loans were based on 80% loan to value, GMRI 
will use state funds to pay down its Farm Credit variable rate loan in order to reduce our
interest rate exposure and stay within Farm Credit’s 80% loan to value requirement. The 
estimated impact on the appraised value of Union Wharf and on our capitalization of 
Union Wharf will be as follows: 
Current State Funds Result 
Appraised Value of Union Wharf: $ 12,445,000 - $4,000,000 = $ 8,445,000 
Sources of Funds to Purchase Union Wharf:A 
Farm Credit Variable Rate Loan $ 5,517,500 - $4,000,000 = $ 1,517,500 
Farm Credit Fixed Rate Loan 4,362,500 4,362,500 
Individual Lender Fixed Rate Loans 2,900,000 2,900,000 
Total Borrowed $ 12,780,000 — 
$4,000,000 = $ 8,780,000 
(The resulting estimated Appraised Value of $8,445,000 is less than the resulting Total 
Borrowed of $8,780,000 as the Individual Lender Loans are unsecured with no loan to 
value requirement and our original ﬁnancing provided $430,000 to fund and Emergency 
Reserve Fund.) 
Why L.D. 1480 vs. Land for Maine Future’s Working Waterfront Access Protection 
Program? 
In the course of our diligence to consider acquiring and protecting Union Wharf, GMRI 
beneﬁted from the advice of local and state leaders. GMRI was encouraged to submita 
proposal to the Land for Maine’s Future’s (LMF) Working Waterfront Access Protection 
Program, which we did in early 2022, to test the capacity of its funding and working 
waterfront covenant. With only $4,000,000 in total funding, of which $2,000,000 was 
programmed for use in 2022, LMF lacked the funds to offset the loss in value ofa 
working waterfront covenant on a wharf the size and value of Union Wharf. Moreover, 
LMF’s waterfront covenant is too narrow to accommodate the variety of maritime 
businesses based on an urban wharf. As a result, LMF did not approve GMRl’s 
application. 
GMRI then approached Sen. Brenner, who has extensive experience with similar 
agricultural easements for working farms, to assist in crafting a funding mechanism to 
protect Union Wharf as a working wharf in perpetuity. 
Vision: 
Union Wharf is the keystone to Portland ’s working waterfront and the ﬁrewall separating 
the tourism businesses of the eastern waterfront from the working Waterfront that starts at 
Widgery VVharf and Union Wharf and extends West. 
Our vision is for Union Wharf to serve as a model for how coastal communities can 
invest in and protect waterfront access in the face of escalating real estate values. Our 
aspiration is to steward and manage Union Wharf as a working wharf in perpetuity asa
model for both working wharf protection and working wharf adaptation to sea level rise 
and other challenges as they arise. 
Our commitment to protect Union Wharf, along with the City of Portland°s commitment 
of the Portland Fish Pier and GMRI’s protection of Wright’s Wharf, will ensure that the 
heart of Portland ’s Working waterfront Works forever. 
See Attachment A: UNION WHARF TODAY and Attachment B: UNION WHARF 
TOMORROW for a sense of our vision to protect Union Wharf as a working wharf and 
increase its capacity to serve maritime tenants. 
Thank yo r your consideration, 
Donald W. Perkins
