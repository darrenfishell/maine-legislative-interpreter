LD 389
Good aftemoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and colleagues on the Health
and Human Services Committee. My name is Cory Reynolds and I live in Waterville. 
I am here today to support LD 389, An Act to Improve Rural Transportation and 
Access to Mental Health Care 
and Physical Health Care.
I strongly support these bills because I know people who deal with mental health on a 
regular basis and itâ€™s sad when we hear of a loved one or friend that is struggling and 
commits Suicide. We have a mental health crisis and it needs to be addressed, i close 
with asking you all to support LD - 389. 
Thank You, 
Republican Cory Reynolds
