Ronald Bancroft
Cumberland
LD 1340
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Ronald Bancroft and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am a native of Maine 
and grew up hunting and fishing.  I am also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy 
and a Vietnam veteran.
I am writing to support LD 1340. Anyone who reads the paper or watches the news 
should recognize that rapid fire weapons are wreaking havoc with our society. We 
should ban all assault type weapons. I hope this bill is but a first step toward this 
common sense goal.
