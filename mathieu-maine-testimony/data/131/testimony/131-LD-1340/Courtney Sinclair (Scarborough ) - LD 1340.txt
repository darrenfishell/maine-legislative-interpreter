Testimony of Courtney Sinclair before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee, in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of 
Rapid-fire Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Courtney and I am a resident of Scarborough.
Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting
in modern American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and 
killed and hundreds more were wounded. These weapon accessories allows a weapon 
to fire at nearly the rate of a machine gun without technically converting it to a fully 
automatic firearm. This serves no purpose other than to increase the rate of fire to 
maximize the number of dead and wounded. An analysis of mass shootings 
committed from 2009 through 2018 found that when assault weapons were used, six 
times more people were shot compared with those incidents in which other firearms 
were used.
Americans do not want mass shootings to occur. No one wants to see people killed 
when there is a way to prevent it.
