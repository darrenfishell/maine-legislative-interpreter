RE: LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices 
 
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,  
 
My name is Gail Witherill  and I am a resident of Cumberland.  With the constant drumbeat of 
deaths by gun violence in our country, I find I must speak  for LD 1340.  One of the largest mass 
shootings -Las Vegas 2017-involved a fellow with multiple guns equipped with bump stocks-
who killed 60 people and seriously injured many more.   Many of the injured now live in 
wheelchairs as they can no longer walk, have feeding tubes as their alimentary canal was 
ravished by bullets, and/or have to endure pain on a daily basis due to the damage in their 
bodies.   Bump stocks maximize the number of dead and wounded.  
 
Vote this bill OTP.  Mainers deserve to be safe, and not subject to these firearm additions that 
are meant for only one thingâ€¦..mass killing. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Gail Witherill 
Cumberland
