I write in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of 
Rapid-fire Modification Devices.
I ask you to consider two key points. 1) These weapon accessories serve no other 
purpose than to increase the rate of fire to maximize the number of dead and 
wounded. 2) Hunters do not need bump stocks to hunt, in fact they are known for 
being inaccurate.
