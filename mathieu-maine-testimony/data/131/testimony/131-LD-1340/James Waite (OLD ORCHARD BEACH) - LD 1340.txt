LD 1340
I'm writing in opposition of LD 1340, "An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of 
Rapid-fire Modification Devices."
This bill makes the possession, transfer, distribution, sale or importation into the State
of a rapid-fire modification device a Class D crime. A rapid-fire modification device 
is a binary trigger system, bump stock device, burst trigger system, trigger crank or 
any other device that is designed to accelerate the rate of fire of a semi-automatic 
firearm.
Although these devices may increase the rate of fire, they don't change the fact that a 
semi-automatic firearm is still a semi-automatic firearm, not a fully-automatic 
firearm, as some would like to believe and as some will mislead the public into 
believing so. There are no Congressionally passed federal laws banning these devices,
so why should you?
The 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution states that a well regulated Militia, being 
necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, 
shall not be infringed. Also, Article I, Section 16 of the Maine Constitution states that 
every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be 
questioned.
I find all gun control laws to be a violation of both Constitutions and I urge the 
committee to vote "Ought Not to Pass" on LD 1340.
