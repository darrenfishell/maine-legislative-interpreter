LD 1340
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Anna Mead and I live in Portland with my husband, my young child, and my 
two dogs. 
I support LD 1340 because rapid-fire modification devices serve no other purpose 
than to maximize the number of dead and wounded in a mass shooting.  According to 
the US Concealed Carry Association, with the use of accessories like bump stocks 
and binary triggers “[a] 30-round magazine can be emptied in about three seconds.”  
Please, take the time to read that statistic again.  Thirty rounds in three seconds.  
These accessories are specifically designed for mass murder. 
On the news, we are inundated by stories of mass shootings - at schools, malls, office 
buildings, hospitals, or, as in Maine last month, just driving on the highway.  Banning
the use of rapid-fire modification devices is just one step we can take towards 
reducing the toll of these mass shootings while we work to address the many other 
factors that contribute to the epidemic of gun violence in our country.
