Testimony  in support  of LD 1340 – ‘An Act to Prohibit  the Sale  or Possession  of 
Rapid -fire Modification Devices’  
 
Honorable Senator Beebe -Center, Representative Salisbury and Members of the 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, I am a Portland resident, a 
pediatrician, a member of Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Gun Sa fety, and a mother.  I am writing today on behalf of the Maine 
AAP.   
 We support LD 1340 and encourage the committee to vote ought to pass on the bill as 
referred . 
 We support this legislation as it will help to prevent a mass shooting in Maine.  This bil l 
prohibits possession of Rapid -fire modification devices to semi -automatic firearms . 
These devices  do not have a place in hunting or self-defense but  can only be useful if the 
intent is to harm as many people as possible.   
 Last November Mainers were ho rrified when active shooter hoax calls were made to ten 
high schools.  The hoax was all too believable due to the number of mass -shootings that 
happen around the country each month.  I was at home when I received the phone call asking if I could come to wo rk to help with a mass -casualty situation .  I said yes without 
hesitation .  It was over an hour before the notification  went out that it was a hoax.  I 
spent that hour hoping that I would have the skills to save lives, hoping that a rapid -fire 
weapon was not i n use as the number of casualties would be so  much greater.   
 Children, because of their size, are in particular danger when rapid -fire firearms are 
involved.  A colleague of mine at the Washington University of St. Louis has shared  
anecdotally that while  their mortality rate with children with injuries from manually -
operated  firearms is <10% it is multiple times higher when assault -weapons are 
involved.  Semi -automatic rifles fire at four times the muzzle velocity of a handgun ,
i can 
liquify organs,ii and can leave a body unrecognizable.iii 
 We were lucky that there wasn’t an active shooter in multiple Maine schools that day.  
We need you to pass this legislation to help prevent this in the future.  Please support 
LD 1340  and recognize  that rapid -fire modification devices  serve no lawful purpose.
