Testimony of Elizabeth Zamore
before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Committee, in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or
Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Elizabeth Zamore and I am a resident of Scarborough.  Guns equipped with 
bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting in modern 
American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and killed and 
hundreds more were wounded. These weapon accessories serve no other purpose than
to increase the rate of fire to maximize the number of dead and wounded. Hunters do 
not need bump stocks to hunt, in fact they are known for being inaccurate. Many 
responsible gun owners report that they do not want to own or use bump stocks.
Thank you in advance for your swift action and feel free to contact me with any 
questions.
