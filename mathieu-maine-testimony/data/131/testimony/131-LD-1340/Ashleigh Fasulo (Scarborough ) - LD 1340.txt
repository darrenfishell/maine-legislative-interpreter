Testimony of Ashleigh Fasulo before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Committee, In SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or
Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is ans Fasulo and I am a resident and teacher in the town of Scarborough. 
 I have been teaching in public schools since 2009, I have been trained in at least three
different active shooter responses.  In my time tenure I have never walked into a 
school environment without immediately assessing the safe spaces and exits, mentally
calculating how I could get my students to safety, wondering if my students with 
Autism diagnoses will
Be able to remain quiet enough in a lock down drill, and trying to remember if I said I
love you to my husband and my own two children before I left for work that day.  
Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting
in modern American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and 
killed and hundreds more were wounded.  These weapon accessories serve no other 
purpose than to increase the rate of fire to maximize the number of dead and 
wounded.
Maineâ€™s children and teachers deserve the RIGHT to a free and appropriate education 
that is SAFE.  We can no longer afford to sit back and do nothing.
