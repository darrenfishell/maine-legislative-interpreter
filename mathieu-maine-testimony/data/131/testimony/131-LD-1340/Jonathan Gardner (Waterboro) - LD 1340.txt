LD 1340
As a gun owner, hunter, and Registered Maine Guide, I am in favor of LD1340.  I see 
no need for these type of devices for civilian use . These devices not only increase the
risk of injury the the shooter, but also bystanders, neighbors, and fellow citizens. 
These rapid fire devices also send more lead downrange and ultimately into the 
environment; leading to potential problems for Maine's wildlife.
