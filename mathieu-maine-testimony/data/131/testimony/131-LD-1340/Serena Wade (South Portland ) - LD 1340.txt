LD 1340
Testimony of Serena Wade
before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-
fire Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Serena Wade and I am a resident of South Portland, ME. I have two young 
children and fear for their safety at school and in public every day because of the 
current gun laws and gun violence we are witnessing regularly in this country.
I support LD 1340 because hunters do not need bump stocks to hunt, in fact they are 
known for being inaccurate and because many responsible gun owners report that 
they do not want to own or use bump stocks. This may not stop mass shootings, but 
we need to try something. Please.  
Thank you for hearing and considering my testimony.
Sincerely,
Serena Wade
