LD 1340
Distinguished Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee;
My name is Carol Riley, and I am a resident of Cumberland Center. I am requesting 
your support for bill LD1340. It is pretty evident that the mass shootings in this 
country are perpetrated by individuals using rapid fire devices. These weapon 
accessories serve no other purpose than to increase the rate of fire to maximize the 
number of dead and wounded. This is an important first step in putting people before 
guns and creating safe gun laws.
Thank you.
Respectfully, 
Carol Riley
