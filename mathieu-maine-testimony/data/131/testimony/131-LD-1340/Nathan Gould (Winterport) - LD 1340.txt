Testimony in Opposition to LD 1340
An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety :
My name is Nathan Gould. I am from Winterport. I am giving this testimony in opposition to LD
1340, “An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices.”
The devices banned by this bill are commonly owned by Mainers, and are not commonly used 
in crimes. This bill creates an undue hardship on those who obey the law and does nothing to prevent 
homicide. There are better avenues to preventing gun violence, and this is not one of them. Please do 
not punish those who use these devices legally for recreation and competitive shooting.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass, and I thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
