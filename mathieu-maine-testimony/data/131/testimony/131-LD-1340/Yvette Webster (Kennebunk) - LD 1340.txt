Testimony of  Yvette Webster before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee regarding my support of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or 
Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Yvette Webster and I am a resident of Kennebunk. 
I support LD 1340 and I am very grateful to Representative Sachs for introducing it. 
Americans are tired of being afraid in public places. We've had enough of mass 
shootings where someone can kill dozens of people with one push of the trigger.
These rapid-fire weapon accessories serve no other purpose than to increase the rate 
of fire to maximize the number of dead and wounded. Hunters do not need them to 
hunt effectively, and the hunters I have talked to know this. They don't need them. 
Responsible gun owners don't need them. Let's make sure Maine doesn't have it's own
Las Vegas-style mass shooting tragedy. Ban bump stocks now.
