Fifteen rounds a second? That is what these bump stocks will enable a firearm to 
shoot. Please outlaw these devices. Please protect me and my family from being shot 
by one of these devices. This is a pro-active bill that will protect Maine's reputation as
a safe state. I'm hoping that you can see how important it is to support this bill.
