LD 1340
I oppose LD 1340.
LD 1340 would ban legal “rapid-fire modification devices” that are already 
commonly owned and in use by Mainers. These devices include but are not limited to 
bump stocks and binary triggers that are used in a wide array of legal activities 
including competitive and recreational shooting. How does the State expect to enforce
such a law? Will they be calling for gun confiscation? A gun buy-back program? 
Creating a gun registry? All solutions are either illegal or result in law-abiding 
citizens being disarmed while giving criminals the upper hand.
