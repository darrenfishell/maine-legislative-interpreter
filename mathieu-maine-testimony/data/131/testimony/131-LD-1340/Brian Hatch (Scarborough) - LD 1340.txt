LD 1340
Testimony of Brian Hatch
before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire 
Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Brian Hatch and I am a resident of Scarborough, ME. I have two young 
daughters and fear for their safety every time they leave our home because of the 
current gun laws and gun violence we are witnessing regularly in this country. 
I support LD 1340 because hunters do not need bump stocks to hunt, in fact they are 
known for being inaccurate and because many responsible gun owners report that 
they do not want to own or use bump stocks.
Thank you for hearing and considering my testimony.
Sincerely,
Brian Hatch
