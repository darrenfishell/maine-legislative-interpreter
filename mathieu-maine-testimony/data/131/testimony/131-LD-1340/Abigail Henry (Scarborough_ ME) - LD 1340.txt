Testimony of Abigail Henry
before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Committee,
in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or
Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and
Public Safety Committee, my name is Abigail Henry
and I am a resident of Scarborough, Maine. 
I am in support of LD 1340 because high-capacity ammunition magazines are 
weapons of war that have no place in our communities and should be banned.
A 2019 study by the American Journal of Public Health analyzing mass shootings that
were committed between 1990 and 2017 found that 77 percent of mass shootings 
perpetrated with a high-capacity magazine occurred in states that did not have 
state-level bans on these specific ammunition-feeding devices. 
It's simple: Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices and 
take one definitive step towards keeping Maine safer from gun violence. 
What could be more important?
