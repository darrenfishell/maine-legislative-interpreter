Testimony of Elizabeth Mitchell before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of 
Rapid-fire Modification Devices:
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Elizabeth Carlson and I am a resident of South Portland. When I drove past 
exit 15 on 295 to see a car riddled with bullet holes and armed officers casing the 
woods due to an active shooter I instantly thought of my son and friends and a need to
confirm their safety. While they were safe at daycare in Portland, not in Yarmouth, 
was little comfort knowing of the multiple school shootings that occur in otherwise 
“safe” communities. That weapons of mass murder are legal in this country allows for
this most primal fear that our children and their caregivers could be shot to death to 
have merit. 
Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting
in modern American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and 
killed. These weapon accessories serve no other purpose than to increase the rate of 
fire to maximize the number of dead and wounded – this is not necessary for any 
sport or hunting. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. This is not a matter of freedom – the 
freedom to own guns is not at question here, it is a matter of safety and common 
sense. 
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Carlson
