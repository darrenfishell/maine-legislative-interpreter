LD 1340
Honorable committee members, 
The federal government prohibition on bump stocks and binary triggers is still making
its' way through the courts, and the legality of said prohibitions are questionable at 
best. Maine does not need to prematurely hop on this bandwagon, in the name of 
fixing a problem that the state has not and does not have. 
LD 1340 ought not pass!
