Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Jeanie Barnard and I live in Yarmouth. I strongly support this bill as these 
weapon accessories make it easier to kill and wound more people. I have several 
neighbors and friends who hunt and they tell me that these devices are not something 
they would ever use as they want to kill the animal and preserve it for food. We need 
to increase gun safety and preserve hunting in Maine not make it a more violent and 
deadly place. Thank you.
