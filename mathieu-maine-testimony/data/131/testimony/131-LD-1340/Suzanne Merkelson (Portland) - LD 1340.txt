Testimony of Suzanne Merkelson before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee, in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of 
Rapid-fire Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Suzanne Merkelson and I am a resident of Portland and a new mother of a 5 
month old, Simon. I am, frankly, terrified for him to start school in a few short years. 
Rapid-fire modification devices make our communities less safe. Guns equipped with 
bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting in modern 
American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and killed and 
hundreds more were wounded. These weapon accessories serve no other purpose than
to increase the rate of fire to maximize the number of dead and wounded. My fear is 
that it's only a matter of time before such a massacre occurs in our state. You have an 
opportunity to make children like my son safer in their schools, on our roads, and in 
any and all public places.
