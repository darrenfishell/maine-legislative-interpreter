Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting
in modern American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and 
killed and hundreds more were wounded.
These weapon accessories serve no other purpose than to increase the rate of fire to 
maximize the number of dead and wounded.
