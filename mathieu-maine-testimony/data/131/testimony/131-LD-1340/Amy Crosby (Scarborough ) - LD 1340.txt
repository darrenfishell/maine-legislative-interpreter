Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my name is Amy 
Crosby and I am a resident of Scarborough.
Iâ€™m writing in to oppose this act. There is no reason why someone should need to 
modify a firearm to fire more rapidly. These modifications are so often found to be 
used in mass shootings - the stories are the same every time. Opposing this is one 
small step of a much larger solution that needs to happen in order for my 5 and 7 year 
old children to not be fearful to attend school.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
