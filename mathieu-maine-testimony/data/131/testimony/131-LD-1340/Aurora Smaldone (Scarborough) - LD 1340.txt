Testimony of Aurora Smaldone, before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee, in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of 
Rapid-fire:
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Aurora Smaldone and I am a resident of Scarborough. I am a long time 
advocate of children's safety and have devoted my career to trauma prevention and 
intervention work. I am also a concerned mom.
I am appalled that gun violence is now the leading cause of death of children and 
youth in the United States. Now more than ever we need common sense gun safety 
legislation to protect our communities and young people. Curbing the sale of 
rapid-fire modification devices is a critical step toward reducing gun lethality. These 
weapon accessories serve no other purpose than to increase the rate of fire to 
maximize the number of dead and wounded. In addition, there is widespread support 
for this basic safety measure. Many responsible gun owners report that they do not 
want to own or use bump stocks. I urge you to pass the proposed act to prohibit the 
sale or possession of rapid-fire modification devices.
Thank you for your consideration.
Aurora Smaldone
