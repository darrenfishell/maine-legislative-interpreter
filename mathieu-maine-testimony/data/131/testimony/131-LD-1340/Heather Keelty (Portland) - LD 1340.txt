Distinguished members of the criminal justice and public safety committee. My name 
is Heather Keelty and I’m a resident of Portland. I am a mother of two young children
and although I have fortunately never been a victim of gun violence, seeing it in the 
news day, after day is wearing. I am strongly urging legislators to support this bill as 
enough is enough; these weapon accessories serve no other purpose than to increase 
the rate of fire to maximize the number of dead and wounded. hunters do not need 
bump stocks, and are actually inaccurate. This is an unnecessary accessory, the only 
purpose is to kill people. pretty much most of all mass shootings Use this type of 
accessory or rapidfire artillery and the least we can do is prevent this from being 
purchased. This has no effect on the hunting community of Maine, which I support 
and is a strong part of Maine heritage and community. I don’t want to see or hear 
about any other people, especially main residents being injured by these type of 
accessories or guns. It’s just smart gun safety.
