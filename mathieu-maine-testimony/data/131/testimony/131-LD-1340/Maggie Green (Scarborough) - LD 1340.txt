Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting
in modern American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and 
killed and hundreds more were wounded. 
Responsible gun owners report that they do not want to own or use bump stocks.
As a parent I canâ€™t feel comfortable bringing my kids into our community without 
fear.  Too many people have access to these types of high risk weapons.  My kids and 
our community deserve to live in a safe community without fear.  Society as a whole 
has developed hairpin triggers emotionally, a weapon on hand brings devastating and 
permanent consequences to precious lives. Our families, our friends and neighbors. 
We have got to do better and provide laws to make us safer. Protect our freedom to 
live safely in our community.
