LD 1340
Testimony of Caroline Culbertson (Pownal, Maine) before the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee,
in SUPPORT of LD 1340 -An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire 
Modification Devices.
This is an important bill, especially on the heels of yet another mass shooting that 
claimed the life of a child and left some victims unrecognizeable in Texas. 
These weapon accessories serve no other purpose than to increase the rate of fire to 
maximize the number of dead and wounded.
Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting
in modern American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and 
killed and hundreds more were wounded.
Please make it harder for mass shootings to take place. I am in support of this bill.
