I support HP 854.  Rapid Fire Modification Devices on Guns needs to be prohibited in
this state.  In just a few years, our public schools are no longer safe for children. The 
idea that parents have to worry about whether or not their child will come home at the
end of the school day without being shot just shows what a terrible direction this 
country has taken.  And teachers should not be in a position where they could be 
killed just by teaching or that the children in their class could be killed.  We need to 
do everything we can to lessen the risk from deaths by shooting.  We are not at war 
and yet the leading cause of death in children is from firearms.  It has surpassed 
drugs, traffic accidents, and drowning, and all other causes including respiratory 
diseases.
