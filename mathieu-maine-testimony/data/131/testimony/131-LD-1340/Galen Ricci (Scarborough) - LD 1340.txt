LD 1340
Dear esteemed members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Galen Ricci and Iâ€™m writing to express my wholehearted support for LD 
1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices. 
This crucial legislation seeks to address a pressing issue in our society by banning the 
sale and possession of devices such as bump stocks, which have been directly 
associated with the most devastating mass shooting in modern American history. It is 
essential that we prioritize the safety and well-being of our communities, and this bill 
is a vital step towards achieving that goal.
In October 2017, the nation watched in horror as a lone gunman unleashed 
unspeakable violence upon innocent concertgoers in Las Vegas. This devastating 
event, the largest and deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, resulted in
the loss of numerous precious lives and left countless others injured physically and 
emotionally. It is imperative that we take decisive action to prevent such horrors from 
recurring.
Rapid-fire modification devices, like bump stocks, exist solely to increase the rate of 
fire of a firearm, allowing it to discharge rounds at an accelerated pace. These 
accessories serve no legitimate purpose for self-defense or hunting needs. They are 
not designed to enhance accuracy or precision. Instead, their sole function is to 
maximize casualties by enabling a shooter to fire more rounds in a shorter span of 
time.
It is crucial to acknowledge that the use of bump stocks or similar rapid-fire 
modification devices has no place in legitimate self-defense scenarios or responsible 
hunting practices. The excessive and indiscriminate rate of fire they enable goes far 
beyond any reasonable need for protection or ethical hunting practices. We must 
ensure that the tools available to individuals are in line with the intended purpose of 
self-defense or sporting activities.
By passing LD 1340, we can take a proactive stance in preserving public safety. The 
primary goal of this legislation is to limit the potential for mass casualties by 
restricting the availability and use of these dangerous accessories. We have a 
responsibility to protect our communities from unnecessary harm and to take concrete
steps to prevent individuals from accessing tools designed solely to inflict widespread
destruction.
It is important to emphasize that supporting this bill does not infringe upon the rights 
of responsible gun owners. LD 1340 targets specifically those devices that serve no 
purpose other than maximizing casualties. By supporting this legislation, we reaffirm 
our commitment to ensuring that the rights of law-abiding citizens are upheld, while 
simultaneously addressing a dangerous loophole that puts innocent lives at risk.
In conclusion, LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire 
Modification Devices, represents a crucial step towards protecting our communities 
and preventing senseless acts of violence. We must not allow weapons and 
accessories designed solely for mass destruction to remain readily available. By 
passing this bill, we can take a meaningful stand against the indiscriminate loss of life
and ensure the safety of our fellow citizens. I urge you to support this important 
legislation and make a lasting impact on the well-being of our society.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
