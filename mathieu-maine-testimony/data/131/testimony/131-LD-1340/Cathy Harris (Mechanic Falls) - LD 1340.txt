Testimony in favor of Bill LD 1011 and Bill 1340 Cathy Daphna Harris 
Dear distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. My name is 
Cathy Harris and I am a retired school teacher from Mechanic Falls. I am also a parent anda 
grandparent. 
l support LD 1101 which would require gun owners to report lost or stolen guns. This law is 
common sense. A responsible gun owner would not want their stolen or lost gun to wind up in 
the hands of a criminal or for a child to accidentally use their gun.~ 
l personally know someone who lost a relative in the horrible shooting in Nova Scotia where 22 
people were murdered. That shooter obtained his weapon in Maine. l am testifying in favor of 
this bill because sometimes guns are not stolen but are instead sold to a criminal. When those 
guns are traced back to the original owner, that owner is able to claim that the gun was stolen. 
A law requiring the reporting of stolen guns eliminates this excuse being used. 
We need to do everything we can to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals. This bill isa 
step towards that goal. 
l also support Bill LD 1340 which is bill to prohibit the sale and possession of rapid fire modifi- 
cations. The mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2018 still haunts us. The gunman Ô¨Åred 1049 rounds 
in eleven minutes killing 58 people and injuring almost 500 more. No one needs a gun to be 
able to produce that kind of fire power. These modifications allow a semiautomatic gun to fire 
with the rate of an automatic rifle. 
All these devices do is turn an already dangerous weapon into a killing machine. What respon- 
sible gun owner needs to be able to fire 15 rounds per second? These devices enable a mass 
shooter to murder dozens of people in seconds. 
ln the interest of public safety, l urge you to pass both these bills. 
Thank you
