LD 1340
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. I am writing to 
urge you to support LD1340. Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the 
largest and deadliest mass shooting in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were 
killed and hundreds more wounded. I have a right to the pursuit of life, liberty, and 
happiness. Laws passed that weaken our gun laws are not protecting my right to life.
