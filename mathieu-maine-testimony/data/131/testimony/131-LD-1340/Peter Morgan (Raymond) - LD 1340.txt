Testimony of Peter S. Morgan, Jr.  
before the Maine Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire Modification 
Devices 
 
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my name is Peter 
S. Morgan, Jr.  I am a resident of Raymond, Maine since my retirement in 2015.  I’m a Coast 
Guard active duty veteran who served from 1969 to 1973, who received an honorable discharge 
upon my release. 
I have seen the progression of gun violence.  Our two sons were in a Philadelphia suburban high 
school at the time of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.  That was an unusual 
occurrence two decades ago.  
It is not happenstance that mass shootings began to occur with an astounding regularity 
following the expiration of the assault weapons ban in 2004.  There is an undeniable correlation.  
In my opinion we have lost the essence of “a well regulated militia.”  Presumably, if we had to 
join one to own a gun, there wouldn’t be such a prevalence of mass murders.  ( My military 
experience illustrated what “well regulated” means. )  Ask yourselves if gun owners are required 
to undergo training or demonstrate relevant firearms knowledge.  
Advances in weapon technology since adoption of the second amendment to the Constitution 
require a reassessment.  There has been a prohibition of machine guns, to prevent the general 
population from having more effective weapons than law enforcement.  Currently, that 
imbalance presents itself with rapid-fire, military style weapons. 
For the benefit of our communities; please recommend LD 1340 “ought to pass.”
