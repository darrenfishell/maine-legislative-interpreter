Testimony of Miranda Gallo before the Crimial Justice and Public Safety Committee 
in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire 
Modification Devices:
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Miranda Gallo and I am a resident of Yarmouth. When I heard of a shelter in 
place order due to an active shooter down the road from my house I instantly thought 
of my daughter and a need to confirm her safety. That she was safe at daycare in 
Portland, not in Yarmouth, was little comfort knowing of the multiple school 
shootings that occur in otherwise “safe” communities. That weapons of mass murder 
are legal in this country allows for this most primal fear that our children and their 
caregivers could be shot to death to have merit. 
Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting
in modern American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and 
killed. These weapon accessories serve no other purpose than to increase the rate of 
fire to maximize the number of dead and wounded – this is not necessary for any 
sport or hunting. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. This is not a matter of freedom – the 
freedom to own guns is not at question here, it is a matter of safety and common 
sense. 
Sincerely,
Miranda Gallo
