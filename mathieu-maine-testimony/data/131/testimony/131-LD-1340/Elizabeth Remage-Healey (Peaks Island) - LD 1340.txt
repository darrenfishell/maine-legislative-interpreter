LD 1340
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, Members of the Criminal Justice and
Public Safety Committee:
My name is Elizabeth Remage-Healey and as a mother, grandmother and resident of 
Maine for over 40 years, I am testifying in favor of LD 1340.
140,000 new guns were added to the already plentiful supply in Maine in just one 
year, 2020-2021. On top of this sea of new guns, the last thing we need is to allow 
them to become de facto machine guns through the addition of bump stocks. The 
deadly rampage in Las Vegas showed what havoc they can wreak.
Maine’s hunting laws restrict guns to only 6 rounds for hunting. Why can’t we 
safeguard our human population like we do our animals?
LD 1340 is a step in the right direction. Thank you for your support.
