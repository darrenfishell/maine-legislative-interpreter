LD 1340
Testimony of Mariah Peric,
before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - 
An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-fire
Modification Devices
Guns equipped with bump stocks were used in the largest and deadliest mass shooting
in modern American history in 2017 in Las Vegas, in which 60 people were shot and 
killed and hundreds more were wounded. These weapon accessories serve no other 
purpose than to increase the rate of fire to maximize the number of dead and 
wounded.
Hunters do not need these devices - they have been proven to be inaccurate.  I cannot 
understand why any sensible gun owners would have an issue with this as all they are 
doing is creating a greater likelihood of mass carnage.  Our country is a disaster right 
now when it comes to gun violence. Clearly what is currently happening is NOT 
working. We need stricter gun laws now.
Thank you.
