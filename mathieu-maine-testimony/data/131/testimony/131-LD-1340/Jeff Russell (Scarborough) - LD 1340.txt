LD 1340
Dear members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Jeff Russell and I am a resident of Scarborough.  As a dedicated citizen 
and father of young children, I am deeply concerned about the issues that LD 1340 
seeks to address.
Of all of the problems in the world and in our country, this is the absolute lowest of 
low-hanging fruit.  We are talking about a common sense measure to marginalize 
products that have no other use than to bring unnecessarily deadly weaponry into our 
society.  
Just after many of the mass shootings occur in our country, the satirical news 
publication The Onion publishes a very non-satirical comment, which sums up the 
issue very well:  
"'No way to prevent this,' says the only nation where this regularly happens."
Bump stocks and related accessories are not needed (and in fact are 
counterproductive) for hunters.  They serve no other purpose than to increase the rate 
of fire to maximize the number of dead and wounded. 
 They have, in fact, been used in the deadliest shootings in modern U.S. history.  This 
limitation should be supported by any person who cares about Mainers and their 
future.
Thank you for your consideration.
