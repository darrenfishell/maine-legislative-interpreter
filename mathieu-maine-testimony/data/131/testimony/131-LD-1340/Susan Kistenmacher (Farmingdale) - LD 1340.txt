LD 1340
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
Please support LD 1340 which would make it a Class D crime to possess, transfer, or 
sell a rapid-fire modification device.
Rapid-fire modification devices convert semi-automatic weapons into extremely 
deadly automatic weapons of war.  
There is no reason for owning one of these devices and no place for them in Maine.
Help keep Maine a safe state.
Please support LD 1430
