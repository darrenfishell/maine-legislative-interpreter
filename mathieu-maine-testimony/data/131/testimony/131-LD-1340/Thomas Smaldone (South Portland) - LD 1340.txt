Testimony of Tom Smaldone before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee, in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of 
Rapid-fire:
My name is Tom Smaldone and I am a resident of South Portland.  I am writing to 
urge you to pass the proposed act to prohibit the sale or possession of rapid-fire 
modification devices. These devices serve no purpose other than to increase the rate 
of fire to maximize the number of dead and wounded.  Frankly, following the events 
of the past six months in our nation with regard to deadly mass shootings, many 
resulting in the deaths of countless children, I am disappointed that I have to actively 
appeal to the Committee to take action in this regard. The State of Maine has a long 
and distinguished history of independent and progressive legislation, often setting an 
example for the rest of the country.  The time to pass a ban on sale or possession of 
rapid-fire modification devices is now.
