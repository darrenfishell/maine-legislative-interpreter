LD 1340
Dear members of the criminal justice and public safety committee, my name is 
Kristen Verrico and I am a resident of Scarborough. I'm writing in support of LD 
1340.
I am a parent of a 5 year old daughter, entering kindergarten in the fall and an 8 year 
old son who will enter third grade. 
In  my opinion, there is absolutely no reason for bump stock technology to exist 
except for protection in warfare.
In Las Vegas 60 people were shot and killed, hundreds more wounded thanks to guns 
equipped with bump stock -- a number so much larger than the boston marathon 
bombings, which have impacted our northeast community so much. 
Hunters don't need bump stock to hunt, in fact they are known as being inaccurate. 
Please vote to protect our communities and especially our children. I can't face 
another mass shooting. 
Kristen Verrico
