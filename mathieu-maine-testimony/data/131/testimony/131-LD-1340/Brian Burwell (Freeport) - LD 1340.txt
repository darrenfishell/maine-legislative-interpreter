LD 1340
Last month Washington became the tenth State (joining Massachusetts, Connecticut 
and New York among others) to ban assault weapons.  The United States has 
experienced 190 mass shootings year-to-date. Our country is a tragic outlier compared
to the rest of the world:  Europe, with a comparable population, has experienced 7 
mass shootings in the same period.  Maine is not immune to mentally unbalanced and 
potentially violent citizens.  How does it not make sense to help protect our families 
by supporting LD 1340?
Sincerely,
