LD 1340
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety committee:
My name is Kathleen Gibbons, and I am a resident of Old Orchard Beach. As a 
mother and grandmother, I am horrified at the senseless violence and trauma caused 
by assault-style and rapid-fire guns. I am writing to voice my SUPPORT for LD 1340
to prohibit the sale or possession of rapid-fire modification devices.
These weapon accessories serve no other purpose than to increase the rate of fire to 
maximize the number of dead and wounded. Many responsible gun owners report that
they do not want to own or use bump stocks.
I urge you to SUPPORT LD 1340.
