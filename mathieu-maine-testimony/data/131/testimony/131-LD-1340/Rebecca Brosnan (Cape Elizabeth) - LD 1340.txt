LD 1340
I strongly support LD1340 to prohibit the sale or possession of rapid-fire modification
devices. There is no good reason to allow these devices. They are designed to murder 
lots and lots of people, and they do not belong in the hands of civilians.
I really don't care if some people think it's "fun" to shoot these guns at a shooting 
range. Too bad. Some things are super dangerous and need to be illegal.
The 2nd Amendment is not a free-for-all for anybody to have any kind of gun 
anywhere, anytime.
I'm a mom of 2 kids in Maine public schools, and I don't want them to be victims of 
or witnesses to gun violence, ever.  We need to put our kids and public safety first!
