LD 98, An Act to Update the Special Education Laws
Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs
Dear Senator Raf ferty and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs:
Today I am introducing a bill for the Department of Education,
LD 98, An Act to Update the 
Special Education Laws.
This bill clarifies that providing equal opportunities for education for children with disabilities
means providing equal opportunities for an appropriate education. The bill changes the age of 
eligibility for special education and for participation in career and technical education courses by
adults who are enrolled in special education from under 20 to under 22. The bill also updates 
some terms to reflect current practice and language.
There is an amendment to this bill that includes a language change for the term “serious
emotional disturbance” to “emotionally disabled.”
The Department of Education will present testimony on this bill and I respectfully request that
you defer any specific questions regarding the content to them. I look forward to working with
you as the Committee deliberates the bill.
Thank you for your consideration of this bill.
District 115: Part of Portland
