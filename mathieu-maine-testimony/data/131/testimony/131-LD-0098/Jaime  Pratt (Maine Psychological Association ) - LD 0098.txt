Re:  LD 98 An Act to Update the Special Education Laws
 
Dear Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan:
The Maine Psychological Association (MePA) is a membership organization representing psychologists in 
Maine who work in private practice, at Maine’s colleges and universities, and in the public sector. Our 
mission is to advance psychology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promoting health and 
human welfare. 
MePA supports LD 98 An Act to Update the Special Education Laws, and requests further revisions or 
amendments to remove any stigmatizing language, including “impairment” and “disturbance.” 
Specifically, MePA requests revising the term “emotional disturbance” to “emotional disability.”
According to a National Institutes of Health press release, “...using appropriate language to describe 
mental illness and addiction can help to reduce stigma and improve how people with these conditions 
are treated in health care settings and throughout society.”
Sincerely,
Jamie Pratt, PsyD
President
