ATTORNEYS Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cul- 
tural Affairs Committee. I am Victoria Wallack, communications and govemment 
relations director for Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf 
L.D. 98. of the legislative committee of the Maine School Boards Association in support of 
This bill, as you know, is a result of a US District Court of Appeals decision re- 
quiring Rhode Island’s Board of Education to provide free and appropriate educa- 
tion to students with disabilities until they reach age 22. 
We are in support of this bill because we believe it correctly anticipates increasing 
the age of eligibility will be required as a result of the Appeals Court decision 
Others testifying today will outline what will be required to implement this billf 
passed by the full Legislature, including what services exist today for these indi- 
viduals, and what services will have to be added. In discussing the bill MSBA did 
recognize there will be additional requirements for districts, however, feel it 1S the 
will be able to charge reasonable fees to those newly eligible. 
Michael Buescher, Esq., Chair right thing to do to have the statute align with the Individuals with Disabilities Ed- 
ucation Act. The bill does reference that Career and Technical Education programs 
One key question is will these programs have the certiﬁed staff to serve an older 
age group? The Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities 1S 
likely in the best position to answer that question.
