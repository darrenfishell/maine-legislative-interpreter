Good Afternoon,
I
am
writing
to
share
my
thoughts
regarding
LD
98.
My
comments
come
from
over
35
years
of
experience
in
education.
I
have
been
a
classroom
teacher,
a
building
level
principal,
and
am
currently
a
Director
of
Academic
Services
who
is
responsible for the PK - 12 experience of all students.
I
have
no
problem
with
the
intent
of
the
proposed
legislation.
Providing
an
education
that
helps
our
students
be
successful
members
of
society
is
what
every
educator,
and
parent,
wants.
However,
I
do
not
agree
with
some
of
the
methods
outlined
in LD 98:
●
As
written,
the
law
applies
to
a
much
larger
population
than
currently
outlined.
This
larger
population
will
increase the financial responsibility of districts all across Maine.
●
The law would set districts up for lawsuits from families who feel their child has not sufficiently met their goals.
●
There is a lack of financial support for the general education
●
And
lastly,
why
is
public
education
the
answer
for
everything?
Why
wouldn’t
funds
be
better
used
to
increase
adult services for students aged 20 - 22?
Thank
you
for
letting
me
share
my
thoughts.
LD
98
is
a
very
important
law.
Why
not
take
the
time
to
do
more
work
with
schools?
Thank you,
Susan Robbins
