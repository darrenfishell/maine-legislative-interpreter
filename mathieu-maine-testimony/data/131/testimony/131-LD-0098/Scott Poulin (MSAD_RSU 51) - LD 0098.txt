As a Finance Director with over 30+ years in Education working for MSAD#51 and 
previously in other districts, I have grave concerns that this bill only has a Special 
Education funding component and ignores Regular Education.  Simply put this bill 
will result in yet another unfunded mandate forced up districts.  I notice at this time 
the bill does not have a fiscal note attached.
