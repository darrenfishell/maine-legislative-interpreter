Support of LD 1066” An Act to Allow a Restaurant to Serve a Bottle of Wine to the
Person Who Brought it” 
As a Maine resident I enjoy supporting local Maine restaurants. Many restaurants 
currently offer a guest to bring a bottle of wine where they charge a corkage fee. I was
surprised to find out this was not legal. This is why I support LD 1066 “ An Act to 
Allow Restaurants to Serve a Bottle Wine to the Person Who Brought the Bottle” 
Every person and restaurant owner I know support LD 1066. The restaurants should 
be able to choose rather or not to charge a corkage fee not the government. 
Thank you,
Joe Mannisto
