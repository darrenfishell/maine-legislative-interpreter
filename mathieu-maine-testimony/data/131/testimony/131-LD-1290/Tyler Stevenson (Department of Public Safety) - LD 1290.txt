Testimony of Lieutenant Tyler Stevenson

In OppositiQn_0f (1290) 
An Act to End the Maine Information and Analysis Center. 
Sponsored by Senator Beebe-Center 
Committee on Criminal justice and Public Safety 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and other distinguished members of the joint 
standing committee on Criminal justice and Public Safety. My name is Lieutenant Tyler Stevenson, and I am 
here to represent the Maine State Police and the Maine Department of Public Safety to testify in opposition 
of LD 1290, “An Act to End the Maine Information and Analysis Center Program”. 
You have previously heard from Commissioner Sauschuck on the importance of the IVIIAC’s role and 
its function as an analytical hub for information sharing and analysis involving a variety of threats and 
crimes. 
The lVlIAC operates to support all law enforcement agencies by providing analytical support and 
information sharing for major or complex criminal investigations, freeing law enforcement agencies and 
investigators to focus on investigative efforts while MIAC staff perform analytical and research functions. 
The lVlIAC not only works closely with law enforcement agencies, but also provides a centralized resource 
with statewide jurisdiction and a capacity to support the remaining agencies who cannot. In fact, only ﬁve 
or six police departments out of over 160 state, local, and county law enforcement agencies in Maine are 
large enough to hire and support their own in-house analyst. Additionally, the l\/IIAC is the only entity that 
can collaborate across all levels in the sharing of relevant real time information and act as the conduit for 
the exchange, analysis, and dissemination of information to and from our federal partners. 
It is widely known that Fusion Centers were born from the foreign terrorist attacks on 9/11. We have 
been asked by members of this committee, “How has the NHAC stopped terrorism threats in Maine?” The 
MIAC has assisted and continues to assist our federal partners in identifying and thwarting potential home- 
grown terrorism threats. However, over the 17 years the l\/IIAC has existed, the threats to people in Maine 
have changed. Although foreign terrorism will always be a nationwide priority, the IVHAC has evolved, as it 
should, and is also focusing on current threats, including but not limited to the complex and rapidly growing

threats involving domestic violent extremism and racially motivated violent extremism, both of which are 
increasing both in Maine and across the nation. Additionally, threats to the safety of our youth and schools 
have never been greater. Nationwide school violence threats have increased, and the MIAC has assisted 
multiple law enforcement agencies in Maine regarding real time threats against our schools. 
Another question asked by this committee is, “How does the MIAC help to keep the people of Maine 
safe?” It is often difﬁcult to quantify prevention as the NHAC is just one spoke in the wheel of the overall 
process. However, I will provide you will a few examples of how the MIAC helps the people of Maine. Just 
this year, pro-Russian Hacktivist group, “Killnet” , released target lists of 50 states’ medical and health 
centers and commenced a cyber-attack campaign on these targets. The MIAC’s Cyber Analyst identiﬁed one 
of Killnet’s targets located in Maine and contacted the target to prompt them to take necessary precautions 
to prevent the attack, and in turn, ensure an important medical center in our state continued functioning. 
Recently, the lVlIAC received information of a bomb threat at a Maine high school. MIAC reviewed the 
information and recognized the same threat was made in two adjacent States. As a result of this information 
sharing, the police were able to not only close their case, but minimize the disruption to the educational 
facility, thus diminishing potential trauma to students and staff. Last summer, the MIAC was contacted by 
the Maine State Police Major Crimes Unit in reference to a homicide investigation that occurred in Acadia 
National Park. It was believed the suspect had ﬂed the State of Maine. The MIAC disseminated updated 
information to Fusion Centers and police across the United States. Through this information sharing the 
suspect was tracked to the US/ Mexican border and eventually apprehended. 
Earlier this session, members of this committee were provided additional examples like these, 
illustrating the MIAC’s assistance to our partners through analysis, information sharing, research, and 
facilitating an increase in collaboration and communication to keep the people of Maine safe. 
All the critical work done in the MIAC occurs under a framework consisting of multiple layers of 
oversight, review, and regulation to ensure that while protecting Maine's infrastructure, citizens, and 
institutions in our communities, we are simultaneously taking steps to protect their privacy, civil rights, and 
civil liberties. When it comes to matters of privacy, the question of how we operate can be as important as 
what we do. 
Finally, we ask that as you listen to additional testimony today, you consider what is right for Maine 
and the people who live and work here. Ask yourself, “Are the people of Maine better served when law 
enforcement and the private sector are less informed and communicate less?” The Department of Public 
Safety and Maine State Police are committed to continued engagement, outreach, and discussion on this 
very important issue. On behalf of the State Police and the Department of Public Safety, we appreciate your
