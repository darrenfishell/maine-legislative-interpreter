Senator Beebe -Center , Representative Salisbury , and Distinguished Members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety  Committee:  
LD 1290 , An Act to End the Maine Information and Analysis Center Program , proposes to terminate 
the Maine Information and Analysis Center which would result in a de appropriation  of $933,204 
over the next year. It would also result in a deallocation to the Highway Fun d and to the Department 
of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management.   
The Maine Department of Education has partnered on several important initiatives with the Maine 
Information and Analysis Center  (MIAC)  and believes they are an important asset to school safety in 
Maine. Currently, the Maine School Safety Center works with MIAC  to enhance communication 
strategies, reporting, response times, and unified plans of action and purpose regarding school 
emergency incidents. Most recently, the Maine School Safety Center worked  with MIAC on the 
swatting incident and have worked toget her to draft guidelines relating to anonymous threat 
communication management. Members of MIAC also serve on our Behavior Threat Assessment 
committee and as a resource to the Department on school threats and safety trends.  
In the event of a school emergen cy incident, the Maine School Safety Center and MIAC are 
developing and implementing communications guidelines that will greatly enhance timely 
communications, better decision making,  and more appropriate responses for Law Enforcement  and 
local superintendents.  During  these critical events, superintendents often have to navigate an 
enormous amount of social media misinformation ; MIAC provides resources that are connected with 
real-time information that law enforcement uses to coordinate informat ion to allow a better flow of 
communication from superintendents to their school and municipal communities. Terminating this 
service may create a strategy and safety gap during school emergencies that the Department and local 
law enforcement do not current ly have the resources to replace.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1290  and respond to  any 
questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Jonathan Shapiro  
Director, Maine School Safety Center
