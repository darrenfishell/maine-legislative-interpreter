Dear Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Dr. Brian Pitman and I am a resident of Orono. I also am a criminology 
professor though I speak only in my capacity as a private citizen with my knowledge 
in criminology. I am writing in support of LD 1290: An Act to End the Maine 
Information and Analysis Center Program. MIAC has been shown to be an 
infringement of the 1st Amendment as it regularly targets political activists. 
Additionally, MIAC also surveilled prominent people in the harm reduction 
community and those who use substances. It’s “Drug Monitoring Initiative” reports 
serve to reinforce the criminalization of substance use. According to The Intercept, 
MIAC also illegally surveilled “racial justice protestors, environmental activists, and 
counselors at an Israel-Palestine peacebuilding camps, as well as maintaining an 
unlawful database of gun owners.” MIAC not only takes public money in the form of 
its budget, but the current lawsuit by a former state trooper is another mechanism by 
which this institution is eating up public money needlessly. 
The money from MIAC’s budget (and the subsequent lawsuits) would be better 
served addressing the needs of people, including housing, substance addiction 
treatment, and mental health needs, among others. The state is in the midst of crises 
around these 3 issues. Policing, especially in the forms of MIAC, do not serve to 
protect us from the harm’s communities experience, but instead exacerbate those 
harms. Addressing directly the housing needs of people, alongside mental health and 
substance addiction are much better investments of public money. Thank you for your
time.
