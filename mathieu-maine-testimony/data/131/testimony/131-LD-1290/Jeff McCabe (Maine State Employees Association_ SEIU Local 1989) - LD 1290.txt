Testimony of Jeff McCabe 
Maine Service Employees Association, SEIU Local 1989 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
May 4, 2023, 
State House Room 436 and Electronically 
In Support of the Concept of: LD 1492, An Act to Increase the Transparency and Accountability of the Maine 
Information and Analysis Center 
In Opposition to: LD 1290, An Act to End the Maine Information and Analysis Center Program 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety, my name is Jeff McCabe, Director of Politics and Legislation for the Maine Service Employees 
Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union. The Maine Service Employees 
Association represents over 13,000 workers across the state. 
I spend a lot of time in the State House and Cross Ofﬁce Building helping members share their stories and 
hearing powerful lived experiences, which is important. However, this isn’t an option for all state employees; 
the type of work that many state employees do can create a conﬂict with them appearing in public and talking 
about their work. This can occur for folks in Corrections, state hospitals, law enforcement work, child protective 
services and others state positions. 
In our Great State of Maine, state law enforcement is supported by numerous civilian employees. These 
employees often have speciﬁc skills and training for the tasks and jobs they perform. It has taken them years to 
obtain these skills and training. These civilian employees put in long hours, deal with short stafﬁng and 
noncompetitive wages that have not kept up with the tasks they perform. The civilian employees working with 
state law enforcement often have jobs that are so speciﬁc that transferring to other position is limited. Civilian 
employees are often supervised by sworn ofﬁcers and work with sworn ofﬁcers who are eligible for special plan 
retirement after 25 years. This is different ﬁ‘om many other states. 
Civilian analysts at the Maine Information and Analysis Center (MIAC): 
There are three State positions that are civilian in the MIAC. The other positions are Maine State Police sworn 
and liaison personnel from other members of the Maine law enforcement community. They also have 
representation from the federal analysts who are attached to the MIAC. 
We have folks who have been at the MIAC over 10 years and I might even say since the beginning of MIAC. 
The MIAC structure is set up to have frequent changing of leadership. Attached I have provided a 
reclassi ﬁcation request from 2016 that one of the analysts provided as a reference. 
In closing, we are supportive of improving transparency and oversight of state agencies. We live in a time when 
we are seeing an increase in threats against schools, public ﬁgures and government entities. The recent activities 
by Neo Nazis in Portland show a scary trend and should give us pause about eliminating a tool like MIAC.
