TESTIMONY BEFORE THE ENERGY, UTILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE 
An Act to Repeal the Law Regarding the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development 
Program 
L.D. 376 
GOVERNOR'S ENERGY OFFICE 
February 14, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology (EUT): My name is Celina Cunningham and I am the Deputy Director of the 
Governor's Energy Office. 
The GEO testifies in opposition to L.D. 376. 
L.D. 376 would eliminate the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program. Specifically, the 
bill repeals the relevant statutory language that established the Program. 
The language that this bill proposes to remove was enacted in 2021 in P.L. 2021 Ch. 380 (L.D. 1710), 
which passed the Legislature with bipartisan support and was signed by the Governor. The Northern 
i\/laine Renewable Energy Development Program was established “to remove obstacles to the use of and 
promote development of the substantial renewable energy resources in northern Maine." The law sets 
forth goals of the program that include meeting climate and clean energy requirements for the state, 
developing the necessary transmission to unlock northern Maine renewable energy resources, and 
supporting economic opportunities in northern l\/laine. It sets forth a timeline for the Public Utilities 
Commission to issue request for proposals associated with a transmission line and renewable energy 
generation projects. 
Following enactment, the PUC issued requests for proposals for northern Maine renewable energy and 
transmission. On November 1, 2022, the PUC issued conditional approval of two projects: the LS Power 
transmission project consisting of a 345 kilovolt double circuit transmission line, which will be capable of 
delivering up to 1,200 megawatts of renewable power from Aroostook County into the ISO New England 
transmission system, and the Longroad Energy wind project, which is the 1,000 megawatt King Pine 
Wind Generation Project. in December, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed to contract for up 
to 40 percent of the projects. On January 31, 2023, the Maine PUC approved the two projects. 
The Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program is a key step toward achievement of our 
state's emissions reduction and renewable energy requirements, and will support economic 
opportunities in northern Maine. Maine households and businesses are confronting volatile energy costs 
resulting from New England's longstanding overreliance on expensive, imported fossil fuels to heat our 
homes and businesses and generate our electricity. By bringing substantial new clean energy resources
l
to Maine and our neighbors, these projects can help reduce energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
The GEO opposes repealing the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program. 
Thank you for your consideration.
