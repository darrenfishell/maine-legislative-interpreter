Testimony in Opposition to LD 376, An Act to Repeal the Law Regarding the Northern 
Maine Renewable Energy Development Program 
To the Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee _ 
by Jack Shapiro, Climate and Clean Energy Program Director 
_ February 14, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Joint Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology, my name is Jack Shapiro. I am the Climate and Clean Energy Director 
at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. NRCM has been working for more than 60 years to 
protect, restore, and conserve Maine’s enviromnent, on behalf of our 25,000 members and 
supporters. I’m here today to testify in opposition to LD 376, An Act to Repeal‘ the Law 
Regarding the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Pro gram.1 o 
The Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program was created by the Legislature in 
2021 via LD 1710.2 The purpose of that bill was to direct the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) 
to solicit bids for Wind projects in Aroostook County and a transmission line that would cormect 
those projects to the rest of the New England grid. Just a few weeks ago, after a successful 
solicitation, the PUC approved a 1,000-megawatt wind project — the King Pine project — anda 
transmission line to connect that project to the rest of the New England grid. That is to say, this 
program is already succeeding. 
For that reason, it is not clear what purpose this bill would serve. If the intention is to delay or 
prevent these projects from being built, it is not clear why.' 
The benefits of wind power, especially today, are well known. Wind power is a great 
complement to solar, peaking at night and in the winter, when solar peaks during the day and in 
the summer. Diversifying our renewable portfolio increases the grid’s resiliency and reduces 
costs overall. And, unlike power generated by burning gas or oil, renewable energy projects 
don’t produce the carbon pollution that causes climate change — which is already bringing 
significant impacts to our state. Some headlines from just the past six weeks include:

Renewable energy projects also routinely offer energy at lower costs than fossil fuel-generated 
power and do not create harmful energy price volatility like natural gas generation. As this 
committee well knows, the large increases in standard offer supply prices of 83% last year}? and 
49% this year9 were driven by high fuel prices for natural gas generators in New England, where 
natural gas still provides about half of our electricity. 
In stark contrast, renewable energy, like the power that will be generated by the King Pine 
project and carried to customers by this new transmission line, has no fuel costs and will come 
with stable pricing for decades. And those contracts have real benefits: a recent report from 
Daymark Advisors estimated that new wind projects of this scale will save Maine electricity 
customers $35 million per year.” 
In addition, these projects will bring significant economic benefits to Aroostook County and the 
state as a whole. A 2021 report presented to this committee during the debate on LD 1710 
estimated that the construction of both the transmission and wind projects would collectively 
generate hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity, thousands of construction jobs, 
tens of millions of dollars in sales and property taxes paid to the state and local communities, and 
dozens of ongoing operations and maintenance jobs. 11 
Finally, these projects were able to be approved because Massachusetts committed to buy 40% 
of the wind power and cover 40% of the transmission project costs. All of New England benefits 
from more renewable energy on the grid driving down wholesale market prices, and this example 
of interstate collaboration bodes extremely well for the years to come, when collaboration and 
cost sharing across New England states will be critical to solving our climate challenges 
collectively to bring down costs across the board.” 
To conclude, infusing our electric grid with low-cost, Maine-made wind energy sourced from 
Aroostook County — as this program does — is an economic boost to local communities, a win for 
Maine electricity consumers, and a promising example of regional collaboration on our energy 
future. The Legislature should firmly reject any attempts to roll back the Northem Maine 
Renewable Energy Development Program or the projects it is supporting.
