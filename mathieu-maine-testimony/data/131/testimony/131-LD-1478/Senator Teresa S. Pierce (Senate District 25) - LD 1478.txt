Testimony of Senator Teresa S. Pierce introducing  
LD 1478, An Act to Improve Women's Health and Economic Security by Funding 
Family Planning Services  
before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services  
April 19, 2023  
  
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and esteemed members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee, my name is Teresa Pierce, and I represent Senate District 25, which includes Falmouth, 
Cumberland, North Yarmouth, Yarmouth (majority), Gray, and Long Island. Today, I am pleased to 
introduce LD 1478, An Act to Improve Women's Health and Economic Security by Funding Family 
Planning Services. 
 
Maine Family Planning is a statewide, private, not-for-profit organization founded more than 50 
years ago to assure access to the full range of family health services for Maine people regardless of 
their ability to pay.  
 
This mission of Maine Family Planning started with former State Representative Sherry Huber, a 
Republican from Falmouth. She and I became acquainted when I first ran for the House in 
2014.  When she passed last year, Maine lost an amazing public servant and I lost a friend and a 
mentor.  Huber was a staunch defender of Family Planning Services. She knew the importance of 
women’s health and its direct connection to economic security.  
 
In Calendar Year 2022, 35,849 people were served by Maine’s Family Planning Network. Services 
funded by the State of Maine and the Federal Government include: contraceptive care; screening, 
diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections; screening, treatment or referral for 
cervical cancer; breast cancer screening; pregnancy testing; intrauterine insemination; vasectomy; 
behavioral health; and primary care. Maine people are healthier every day because of these services.   
 
The funds needed to continue these important services are at risk. Uncertainty at the federal level due 
to a number of court decisions in just the past year threaten the resources available. If we are to 
ensure that these services and access to healthcare are available to all across the state we as a State 
must step up and fund these important services at the State level.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to present this bill. I am happy to answer any questions to the best of 
my ability.

The funds needed to continue these important services are at risk. Uncertainty at the federal level due

Testimony of Senator Teresa S. Pierce introducing  
LD 1478, An Act to Improve Women's Health and Economic Security by Funding 
Family Planning Services  
before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services  
April 19, 2023  
  
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and esteemed members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee, my name is Teresa Pierce, and I represent Senate District 25, which includes Falmouth, 
Cumberland, North Yarmouth, Yarmouth (majority), Gray, and Long Island. Today, I am pleased to 
introduce LD 1478, An Act to Improve Women's Health and Economic Security by Funding Family 
Planning Services. 
 
Maine Family Planning is a statewide, private, not-for-profit organization founded more than 50 
years ago to assure access to the full range of family health services for Maine people regardless of 
their ability to pay.  
 
This mission of Maine Family Planning started with former State Representative Sherry Huber, a 
Republican from Falmouth. She and I became acquainted when I first ran for the House in 
2014.  When she passed last year, Maine lost an amazing public servant and I lost a friend and a 
mentor.  Huber was a staunch defender of Family Planning Services. She knew the importance of 
women’s health and its direct connection to economic security.  
 
In Calendar Year 2022, 35,849 people were served by Maine’s Family Planning Network. Services 
funded by the State of Maine and the Federal Government include: contraceptive care; screening, 
diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections; screening, treatment or referral for 
cervical cancer; breast cancer screening; pregnancy testing; intrauterine insemination; vasectomy; 
behavioral health; and primary care. Maine people are healthier every day because of these services.   
 
The funds needed to continue these important services are at risk. Uncertainty at the federal level due 
to a number of court decisions in just the past year threaten the resources available. If we are to 
ensure that these services and access to healthcare are available to all across the state we as a State
