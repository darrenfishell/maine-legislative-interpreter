Representative
Meyer ,
Senator
Baldacci
and
members
of
the
Health
&
Human
Services
Committee,
My
name
is
Kelli
McCannell,
and
I
am
the
Executive
Director
with
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!),
an
education
and
advocacy
or ganization
led
by
grandmothers
and
elders
dedicated
to
advancing
reproductive
health,
rights
and
justice
for
present
and
future
generations.
GRR!
was
founded
in
Maine
in
2013
and
currently
engages
over
500
Maine
activists
in
our
work.
I’m
here
to
testify
on
behalf
of
GRR!
in
support
of
LD1478:
An
Act
to
Impr ove
W omen's
Health
and
Economic
Security
by
Funding
Family
Planning
Services
.
As
elders,
GRR!s
understand
deeply
the
importance
of
access
to
family
planning
services.
T oo
many
generations
have
been
subject
to
misinformation,
lack
of
information,
and
patriarchal
limitations
on
sexual
and
reproductive
healthcare.
In
the
wake
of
national
bans
and
criminalization,
it
feels
impossible
for
folks
to
stay
up
to
date
on
the
legality
of
family
planning
services.
When
pregnant
people
are
forced
to
navigate
an
intentionally
confusing
system
to
receive
care,
each
day
matters.
Maternal
mortality
rates
in
the
US
healthcare
system
are
shockingly
high
and
rising.
Our
or ganization
is
committed
to
ending
the
criminalization
of
pregnancy
and
all
of
its
outcomes,
as
well
as
uplifting
the
Reproductive
Justice
movement’ s
principles
of
providing
all
parents
with
the
power
and
r esour ces
to
raise
children
in
safe,
healthy
&
sustainable
environments.
It
is
from
this
values-based
framework
that
we
call
on
you
to
support
LD1478.
When
families
are
informed
with
options
and
access
to
services,
health
and
economic
security
increase
not
only
for
the
individuals,
but
for
society
as
well.
GRR!
ur ges
the
committee
to
vote
in
support
of
this
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration,
Kelli
McCannell
&
GRR!s
across
Maine
