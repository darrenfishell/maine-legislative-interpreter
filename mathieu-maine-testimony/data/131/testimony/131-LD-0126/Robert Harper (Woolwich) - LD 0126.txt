LD 126
I would like to testify against LD 126. An Act to Improve the Fairness of Adaptive 
Management Study Moose Hunt Permits by Exempting Those Permittees from the 
4-year Limitation on Receiving Another Permit, is anything but fair. The people 
drawn for an Adaptive Management Study Moose Hunt Permit, and were 
unsuccessful, should not to allowed to reenter the Moose Permit Lottery without 
waiting out the required three years. This is unfair on so many levels. It is unfair to 
those hunters who were unsuccessful in other WMDs. It is unfair to all of the people 
who've been drawn in the past and had to wait. It is unfair to the countless other 
hunters who would have applied for these permits in the past, if they had known the 
rules would be bent for then if unsuccessful, but didn't because they didn't want to 
waste their one and only chance at getting a coveted moose permit on a hunt like that. 
It is  very unfair to the large percentage of people who've never been drawn, or drawn 
and had to wait the three years. The people who were drawn for these Adaptive Hunt 
Permits had the chance of a lifetime to hunt for a Maine. moose. If these people are 
allowed back into the lottery early, inevitable, some will be drawn. Don't diminish the
chances of those who haven't had the opportunity to do so. Those people knew the 
rules and what they were signing up for. They knew they would loose bonus points 
and have to wait the three years. If  you want fairness, don't change this. Thank you.
