 Senat or La wrence, R epresentati ve Zeig ler, and the members of the Joint Committ ee onEner gy, Utilities, and T echnology ,
I am t estifying t oday on behalf of Sierr a Club Maine, r epresenting o ver 22,000 support ersand members stat ewide. F ounded in 1892, Sierr a Club is one of our nation ’s oldest andlargest en vironmental or ganizations. W e work diligentl y to amplify the po wer of our 3.8million members nation-wide as w e work towards combating climat e change andpromoting a just and sustainable econom y. To that end, w e str ongly ur ge an “oug ht not t opass” r eport on L.D . 340:An Act Regarding t he Purposeand R esponsibilitie s of t he S tateRegulat ory System f or Public Utilitie s.
With all due r espect , L.D . 340 is a w aste of the committ ee’s time. The legislation, if enact ed,would eff ectively undo a bill fr om last session: L.D . 1682:An Act To Requir e Consider ation ofClimat e Impacts b y the Public Utilitie s Commission and T o Inc orpor ate Equit y Consider ationsin Decision Making b y State Agencie s. L.D . 1682 r ecei vedan “oug ht to pass” r eport b y thiscommitt ee in June 2021 and w ent t o pass the House and Senat e shortl y ther eafter, recei vingbipartisan support in both chambers. Has so much changed in the last couple y ears that thestate should r everse dir ection on addr essing the climat e crisis? Of course not .
While Sierr a Club does br oadl y support eff orts t o educat e consumers t o mak e decisions intheir best int erest and the best int erest of our climat e, a mandat e to educat e indi vidualscannot come at the cost of taking a way our go vernment’s ability t o set rules and standar dsto reduce gr eenhouse g as emissions. As y ou kno w, decades of o verpr oduction ofgreenhouse g asses ha ve serv ed to insulat e our planet , retaining mor e heat y ear aft er year.In fact, just this past January w as the w armest on r ecor d in Maine.1Scientists ha ve warnedthat a verage g lobal t emper atur es could r each 1.5 degr ees celsius o ver pr e-industrial le velsby as soon as 2040, a t emper atur e benchmar k long seen as an indicat or of futur e

environmental disast er.2While Maine is, of course, onl y responsible f or a small per centageof global emissions, w e ha ve a r esponsibility t o futur e gener ations t o tak e every measur e toprevent this disast er. An assumption that consumers will be able t o mak e decisions withoutgovernment int ervention t o significantl y reduce car bon emissions defies hist oricalprecedent , which indicat es quit e the opposit e.
Sierr a Club r ecognizes that utilities pla y a critical r ole in decar bonizing our econom y.  Inorder f or us t o meet our climat e goals w e must both r apidl y decar bonize the electricitysystem and e xpand the suppl y of electricity t o meet incr easing demand fr om beneficialelectrification.  As the r egulat ory bod y for the utilities, the decisions of the Public UtilitiesCommission will pla y a k ey role in det ermining w hether or not w e meet our climat e goals.It’s no coincidence that the stat es that ha ve been able t o mak e the most pr ogress r educingemissions t o dat e ha ve agencies that ar e empo wered to tak e leadership.
Ther efore we str ongly ur ge an “oug ht not t o pass” r eport on L.D . 340:An Act Regarding t hePurpose and R esponsibilitie s of t he S tate Regulat ory System f or Public Utilitie s. Thank y ou foryour time and consider ation.
