TESTIMONY BEFORE THE ENERGY, UTILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE 
An Act Regarding the Purpose and Responsibilities of the State Regulatory System for Public 
Utilities 
L.D. 340 
GOVERNOR'S ENERGY OFFICE 
February 14, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology (EUT): My name is Dan Burgess, and l am the Director of the Governor's Energy 
Office (GEO). 
The GEO testifies in opposition to l..D. 340. 
L.D. 340 would remove the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the basic purpose of the State's 
regulatory system for public utilities and instead require that the regulatory system educate consumers. 
Specifically, the bill would remove language directing the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to facilitate 
achievement of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements set forth in Title 38, section 576- 
A, which requires that by January 1, 2030, the State shall reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% 
below 1990 levels and that by January 1, 2050, the State shall reduce those emissions by at least 80%. 
The language that this bill proposes to remove was enacted last year by the 130"‘ Legislature in P.L. 2021 
Ch. 279 (L.D. 1682), in a bipartisan effort to increase consideration of climate impacts in the work of the 
PUC. The current language recognizes that the PUC and the regulations it shapes are crucial to achieving 
Maine's energy goals as well as statutory requirements for greenhouse gas reductions. Indeed, meeting 
Maine's goals will not be possible without the dedicated efforts ofthe Commission. 
L.D. 340 proposes to replace the greenhouse gas reduction language with language requiring that the 
regulatory system educate consumers. The GEO notes existing energy consumer protection and 
education provisions in state law (Title 35-A, §3203) and in Commission rules (Chapter 305, for 
instance). The Office of the Public Advocate (OPA) and the Consumer Assistance and Safety Division 
within the PUC both serve important statutorily directed roles in representing and advancing the 
interests of consumers. The GEO also actively works to advance consumer education related to energy 
matters in several different areas, including through heating fuel surveys, production of a winter energy 
heating guide, and other efforts. The GEO also hosts numerous pages on its website‘ to help inform 
consumers about energy prices, electricity bill components, winter energy security, and available 
rebates, among others.

The GEO opposes the proposed changes to the PUC’s Statement of purpose. Thank you for your 
consideration, and I would be happy to answer any questions.
