Re:  LD 1858  â€“ An Act to Ensure Access to Newly Born Male Infant Circumcision by Requiring 
MaineCare Coverage  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide information in opposition to  LD 1858 , An Act to Ensure Access to Newly 
Born Male Infant Circumcision by Requiring MaineCare Coverage . This bill requires the 
MaineCare program to provide reimbursement for the costs of  newly born male infant 
circu mcision beginning January 1, 2024.  
 
Federal Medicaid regulations  dictate services  are only reimbursable if they are required and 
medically necessary. Since non -therapeutic circumcision is not medically necessary, MaineCare 
would not be able to claim federa l match for these services . There are also concerns from some 
medical professionals that non -therapeutic circumcision may be harmful/risky . To remain  in 
compliance  with federal la w, non-therapeutic circumcision  would have to be paid for entirely with 
state dollars. We do not believe it would be a wise use of Department time to pursue a state plan 
amendment that conflicts with federal regulations.  
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If you 
have an y further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director  
MaineCare Services
