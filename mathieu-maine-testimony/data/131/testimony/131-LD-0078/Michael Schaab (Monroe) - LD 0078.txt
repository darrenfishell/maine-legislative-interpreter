Michael Schaab
Monroe
LD 78
Dear Senator Anne Carney, Representative Matt Moonan and Distinguished members
of the Judiciary Committee.
My name is Michael Schaab and I live in Monroe, Maine. I am writing in support of 
LD 78. I have two reasons to ask you for your support. I believe that bringing this 
Constitutional Amendment to the people for a vote in November will engage the 
people of Maine in a civil discourse that will help us focus on the history and the 
obligations of the state to the tribal entities that lie within our border. This 
‘conversation’ will have both historical and contemporary components that are 
important parts of our heritage and culture. 
Secondly, in Governor Dingley’s 1875 state of the State address, he made if very 
clear that he wanted a committee to review the State Constitution and make changes 
that would make it easier for the casual reader to understand the ‘fundamental law of 
the State’. By omitting certain sections, the casual reader would wonder what was 
contained in those sections and why were they omitted. It is simply more 
straightforward to include them in subsequent printings, especially as they are still in 
effect.
Thank you for your time and for the work you do to serve all people in Maine,
