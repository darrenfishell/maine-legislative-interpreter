LD 78
I am writing in support of Ought to Pass, on LD 78, proposing an Amendment to Article X of 
the Constitution of Maine Regarding the Publication of Maine Indian Treaty Obligations. As a 
supporter of Tribal Sovereignty, and returning to the Tribes in Maine the rights which are 
accorded all other federally recognized Tribes in this Nation, I believe this bill is essential as a
building block to that intention. And a way to offer some reparations, to the Tribes, at least in 
recognizing that removing language about the treaties from the Constitution, although not 
removing the intent of the treaties, was none the less very damaging. And returning that 
repect and recognition of the historical treaties is a way to regain more trust in the relationship
between the Tribes and the State of Maine, which most Mainers, including myself, consider 
essential.
Thank you very much for your consideration. Meredith Bruskin, FNP, Swanville, Maine
