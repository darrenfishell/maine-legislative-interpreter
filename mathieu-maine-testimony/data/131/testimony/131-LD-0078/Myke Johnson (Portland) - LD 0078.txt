LD 78
I first moved to Maine 18 years ago, and a few years later I was astonished to learn 
that there was a section of the state constitution that could not be included in written 
copies. Of course you already know that Article X, Section 5 clarifies Maineâ€™s 
obligation to uphold and defend treaties made between Massachusetts and the 
Passamaquoddy and Penobscot Nations. While the section remains in force and can 
be read online, an 1876 amendment prohibits their inclusion in printed versions of the 
constitution. Both LD 78 and LD 578 are amendments to the state constitution that 
would require that Section 5 be included in all printed copies of the constitution. I 
support both of these bills--first of all for the sake of basic historical clarity. Secondly,
it would be another step toward healing the relationship between the state and the 
Wabanaki nations. Thirdly, the Wabanaki Alliance supports this action, and I am 
proud to count myself among the wider coalition of their supporters. As a retired 
minister, I try to support whatever can promote a healing and fair way to move 
forward with our co-existence in this beautiful place.
