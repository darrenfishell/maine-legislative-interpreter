Re: LD 78
Please approve this bill so that Maine voters may learn more about the truth of our history 
and decide if our constitution should make visible what has been invisible regarding Maine’s 
first residents.
Your support is one very important step to take in healing relationships in which those
who preceded you in power had made invisible the existence and rights of our state’s 
first people. 
We Mainers who are not descendants of first people have enjoyed the benefits of our colonial
history and we will continue to do so, in the event that LD 78 goes forward to let Maine voters 
make their choice known. 
History demonstrates that when all communities, families and individuals are respected, all of 
us benefit. 
I thank the committee for your consideration of my request to support LD 78.
Kerry Sack
