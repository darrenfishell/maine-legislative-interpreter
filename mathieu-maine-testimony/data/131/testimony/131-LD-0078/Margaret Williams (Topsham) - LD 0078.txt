At the age of 21, during a week at the Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center women's 
leadership training, I learned that the Maine Legislature does not print a section of our
Constitution that clarifies Maineâ€™s obligation to uphold and defend treaties made 
between Massachusetts and the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot Nations. I 
immediately understood this to be a sign that the State government wanted to hide a 
responsibility it had and prevent the good conscience of its legislators from 
recognizing all the various ways it violates it own rule of law,  deceiving and harming
Maine's people. Please pass this resolution to print the entire Constitution without 
omissions.
