LD 78
Testimony in Support of LD 78 “RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to 
Article X of the Constitution of Maine Regarding the Publication of Maine Indian 
Treaty Obligations”
March 6, 2023
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the 
Committee on Judiciary,
My name is Adrienne Horne, I am a resident of Appleton, and I am sharing my 
testimony in support of LD 78. The sections of Article X that were removed from 
print in 1876 are still valid and applicable to our Maine Constitution today and should
be visible to anyone who reads a copy, regardless of whether that copy is in print or 
online.
As a Maine resident for most of my life, I am only now beginning to learn about the 
shared history of my settler relatives and Wabanaki Tribes. While it has become 
easier to learn about some of my ancestral truths online, it's still difficult to find many
historic truths and move forward with our future especially when the basic foundation
of Maine's Indian treaty obligations are obscured from view and not able to be 
printed. LD 78 would require Section 5 of Article X to be included in all printed 
copies of the constitution. Ensuring that the true language of the Maine Constitution is
visible in all forms is a move towards truer representation of our history.
Thank you for the work you have done and are doing for our judicial system. I ask 
you to please join me in support of LD 78 “RESOLUTION, Proposing an 
Amendment to Article X of the Constitution of Maine Regarding the Publication of 
Maine Indian Treaty Obligations"  to ensure our printed copies of the Maine 
Constitution accurately portray all valid and applicable obligations.
Sincerely,
Adrienne Horne
