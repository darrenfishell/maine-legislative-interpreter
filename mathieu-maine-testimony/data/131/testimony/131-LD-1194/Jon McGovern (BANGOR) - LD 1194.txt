Testimony in Opposition of LD 1194 An Act to Implement Work Requirements 
Under the MaineCare Program.   
 
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee,  
 
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor.  I am a self-advocate, 
meaning I am a person who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of 
Speaking Up For Us, Maineâ€™s Self-Advocacy Network. 
 
I am in opposition of LD 1194 because while many individuals with 
disabilities want to be employed there are many barriers to employment.  
This includes transportation, to and from work.   
For many people with disabilities working that many hours a week would 
also mean they could potentially lose their benefits.   
 
I am asking you to oppose LD 1194. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Jon McGovern
