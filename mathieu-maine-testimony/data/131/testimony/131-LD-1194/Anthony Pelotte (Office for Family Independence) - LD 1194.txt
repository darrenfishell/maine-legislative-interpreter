Re: Opposition to LD 1194 An Act to Implement Work Requirements Under the MaineCare 
Program  
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Committee Health and 
Human Services:  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to share the Department’s opposition to LD 1194 , An Act to 
Implement Work Requirements Under the MaineCare Program .  
This bill  establishes work requ irements for certain individuals as a condition of participating in  
the MaineCare Program . These requirements would include : 1. Working 20 hours or more per 
week, averaged monthly ; 2. participating in and complying with the requirements of a work 
program 20 hours or more per week, as determined by the department;  3. Volunteering 20 hours 
or more per week, as determined by the department;  4. Meeting any combination of working and 
participating in a work program for a total of 20 hours or more per week, as determined by the 
department; 5.  Participating in and complying with the requirements of a workfare program as 
implemented by the department.  This bill establishes e xceptions from these requirements  for 
MaineCare members who are under 19 years of age, are 65 years of age or older, are medically 
certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment, are pregnant, are a parent or caregiver 
responsible for the care of a dependent child under one year of age  or for the care of a dependent 
child with a serious medical condition or disability, as determined by the departme nt, are 
receiving unemployment compensation and are complying with that program’s work 
requirements, or are participating in substance use and/or alcohol use disorder  treatment .  
The Department opposes this bill . Imposing work requirements in the MaineCare  Program is 
impermissible absent a waiver granted under  Section 1115 of the Social Security Act.  Section 
1115 waivers allowing for such criteria have been challenged nationally in recent years, with 
numerous courts finding their usage to impede access to public health insurance.  In January 
2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14009 which compe ls all Medicai d-administering 
bodies to review “demonstrations and waivers, as well as demonstration and waiver policies, that 
may reduce coverage under or otherwise undermine Medicaid or the ” Affordable Care Act  or 
“(ACA )”. Executive Order 14009 further i nstructs agencies to “suspend, revise, or rescind”, in 
accordance with governing procedures, all actions that may be inconsistent with its established 
law and policy.  Enactment of this bill would preclude compliance with federal mandate, as it 
would requir e Maine to take action already subject to legal scrutiny.  In addition to  the foregoing

 constraints, Maine has taken appreciable steps to promote and preserve MaineCare availability 
throughout its communities . This legislation as offered wholly compromises this goal.   
Absent the federal approval consideration , this proposal would require significant department 
resources to verify activities  and medical conditions and treatments  of members and potentially 
their children and to monitor, track and reinforce the  proposed work requirements . Additionally, 
the proposed implementation date would prove impossible  due to rule -making, required 
technology changes and  staffing needs . 
In summary , the Department opposes this bill  as it would prove  detrimental to Mainers , 
specifically those eligible for and in need of health care  benefits and services .  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
Anthony Pelotte, Director  
Office for Family Independence
