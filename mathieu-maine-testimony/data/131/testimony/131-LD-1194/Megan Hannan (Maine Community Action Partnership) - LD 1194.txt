207-324-5762  Maine Community Action Partnership Opposes LD 1194 An Act to 
Implement Work Requirements Under the MaineCare Program  
 
April 7, 2023  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services , I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership , and we oppose LD 1194 An 
Act to Implement Work Requirements Under the MaineCare Program . 
 MaineCare does  not require its  recipients be working, but having access 
to it makes it much easier and more likely t hat they are able to work.  
People with chronic illness often would not be able to  work f ull or even 
part time  without access to medical care  that MaineCare provides, 
making it a work incentive, r ather than disincentive. In fact, many if not 
most p eople who qualify for MaineCare also qualify for other  benefits  
which do require at least 20 hours of work or volunteer time each week.  
 I realize the state is in a workforce crisis, we need more workers to keep 
our businesses going. The answer to that problem is to create and 
enhance our workforce development programs, our woefully underfunded 
and outdated transportation systems, our childcare availability and 
affordability, and to ease the so -called “welfare cliff,” which is what may 
actually disincentivize going to work. When a family makes just a little bit more money, they lose access to more ; they may lose childcare 
subsidies, income supports and SNAP. The family may earn another 
dollar an hour, but then loses far more and finds itself once again unable 
to buy food.  
 
We already know the outcome of this bill –  we have seen it here and in 
other states . Creating barriers to supportive programs does not 
incentivize work.  Individuals and families living in poverty spend hours a 
week meeting with compliance for any and every program they apply for 
and receive. Programs work at cross purposes; one section of  DHHS 
does not talk to another, requiring the same paperwork from customers again and again; the causes and conditions of poverty are systemic, not a 
result of personal failings.  
 
You, as the Legislature, run the systems . Please make them work better 
for people, not more difficult.  
 
Thank you for your time and attention.
