SNAP‘ 
The SNAP program is proven to reduce poverty and food insecurity and it's many of our client's 
first line of defense against hunger? It's common sense that having enough to eat must come 
before employment, but SNAP benefits are also designed to support work by gradually phasing 
out as incomestrisef ‘ The majority of people receiving SNAP who can work, do work. A report 
from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that nearly two-thirds of adults 
receiving SNAP ',in a 3.5 year period worked in the majority of months in which they received 
food assistanceand more than one-third of non-disabled adults worked in every month they 
received benefits.5 However, the jobs most available to those with lowest income often have 
variable schedules, low pay, and lack benefits such as paid sick time. Therefore, low-wage 
workers, many of whom participate in SNAP, are more likely to experience gaps in employment 
or fluctuations their monthly earnings making SNAP a critical, short-term resource to help 
meet their nutritional needs. /
I 
While we know that work requirements diminish SNAP's efficacy when participants who cannot 
find or maintainemployment lose their benefits, federal work requirements for SNAP are 
already in place, As referenced in LD 784, Section 6(0) of the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 
2008 limits those over 18 years of age and under 50 years of age without dependents to 
receiving three months of SNAP benefits every three years unless they are working or in anA 
approved training program for at least 20 hours per week.5 These requirements were 
suspended undelr the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE), but will go back into effect when 
the PHE ends on?May 11, 2023. Given that these rules already exist for adults without 
dependents, and will be reinstated in the coming month, we are unclear what the intent of LD 
784 is with regar' ,cl to SNAP. 
A state agency rriay seek to waive these time limits for some or all SNAP recipients if the 
specific geographic area in which they live has an unemployment rate over 10% or does not 
have enough jobs to provide employment to all those individuals. LD 778 would prohibit 
Maine's Departmjent of Health and Human Services (DHHS) from requesting such a waiver, 
regardless of ourlcurrent economic circumstances. Tracking individual employment and work 
hours is not only a resource-intensive ‘ administrative task for DHHS, but geographic waivers 
also provide flexibility for states to recognize regional variation in economic opportunity which 
tend to benefit residents of more rural parts of our state. Maine does not currently qualify for' 
a statewide waiver based on our most recent unemployment data,7 so work requirements for 
adults without children will apply to all geographic regions following the end of the PHE. In this 
context, it is again unclear what LD 778 presently hopes to achieve. If there were an economic 
shift that resulted in high unemployment in certain regions of our state, it is important that we 
have tools availablle to respond to those changing circumstances to ensure food insecurity 
does not rise. ’'

MaineCare 
Time and again, Maine voters have expressed their strong support for more health care, not 
less. Two of the bills being heard today—LD 784 and LD 1194——seek to implement similar work 
requirements to the SNAP program for participation in our MaineCare program. Not only does 
this frame the lifesaving necessity of healthcare as a privilege to be earned, but work g 
requirements for Medicaid participation arefnot allowable under current federal guidance. 
Section 1115 waivers are intended to allow states to experiment with changes to Medicaid that 
would further the program's goal of promoting healthcare coverage and access. Because 
work requirements are in opposition to that purpose, multiple courts blocked implementation 
of states’ waivers with work requirements during the Trump Administration and the Biden 
Administration withdrew approval of all waivers with work requirement provisions in 2021.8 
It's not surprising that studies reveal Medicaid coverage and access to medications and 
treatment helps people find and maintain employment.i One study of Montana's Medicaid 
expansion, found an increase of four to six percentage points in labor force participation 
among low-income, non-disabled adults under 64 following their expansion, as compared to 
higher-income non-Medicaid adults in Montana and to the same population in other non- 
expansion states.9-There is also little evidence to suggest that loss of coverage due to work 
requirements that were imposed in states such as Arkansas under the Trump Administration 
lead to any greater employment outcomes.1°- 
When low-income people have access to affordable healthcare, it improves more than just 
their health. It also improves financial stability by reducing out-of-pocket healthcare costs, 
medical debt, and allows families to pay for basic necessities like food and housing. Medical 
debt is an increasing problem in this country and one that negatively impacts credit scores 
and consequently an individual's ability to rent an apartment, purchase a vehicle, and even to 
get certain jobs. In short, healthier people are healthier, more financially stable employees. 
General Assistance 
Finally, Senator Brakey's bill, LD 784, also seeks to impose‘ additional work requirements on 
municipal general assistance (GA) programs. Much like SNAP, GA already has stringent work 
requirements in place, with an arguably higher threshold for workforce participation. Currently, 
any applicant for GA may be found ineligible for assistance for 120 days for refusal to 
participate in a whole host of employment-related activities including, ”willfully performs a job 
under subsection 2 below the average standards of that job/'11 GA is a necessary lifeline for so 
many who are struggling to stay housed and make ends meet and erecting more barriers to

participation will do little to encourage employment and only further entrench existing 
inequities. _ 
At a time when‘the state is working to unwind additional benefits and flexibilities under the 
federal PHE, including reinstating existing work requirements for SNAP, the end of emergency 
SNAP benefits, and the restart of the MaineCare redetermination process for all members, we 
should not be adding to this already heavy administrative and financial burden by imposing 
ineffective and harmful work requirements to another program. For all these reasons we 
strongly oppose LD 778, LD 784, and LD 1194 and urge you to do the same. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today‘ and I would be happy to answer any questions.
