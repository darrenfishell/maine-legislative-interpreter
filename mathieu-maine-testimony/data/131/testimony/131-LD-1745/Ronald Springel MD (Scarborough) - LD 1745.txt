Testimony in FAVOR of LD 1745 
An Act to Support Public Health by Protecting Certain Activities 
Conducted Under Comprehensive Community Drug Checking 
Initiatives 
Dear Senator Bee-Bee Center, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members 
of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, my name is 
Ron Springel, a resident of Scarborough. I am a retired addiction medicine physician 
and also serve as a member of the Harm Reduction Council of Project DHARMA. 
My opinions expressed here are strictly my own and do not represent any other 
organization with which I may be affiliated. 
Project DHARMA is an important grant-funded effort to help reduce the impact of 
prescription drug related substance use disorder in Maine. Spearheaded by Dr. 
Kristen Silvia, it will have a significant impact on gathering data about what is going 
on at the street and user level of our drug epidemic. 
I fully support LD 1745 and urge its passage. The bill will allow the project staff and 
others to perform their work without fear of technical controlled substances 
violations. 
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1745 or refer to an appropriate committee of 
the legislature for review at a work session. 
Thank you very much. 
Respectfully Submitted, 
 
Ronald D. Springel, MD Scarborough, ME May 1, 2023
