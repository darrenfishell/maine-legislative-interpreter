Senator
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury ,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety:
I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portland’ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
Support
of
LD
1745,
An
Act
to
Support
Public
Health
by
Pr otecting
Certain
Activities
Conducted
Under
Compr ehensive
Community
Drug
Checking
Initiatives
.
This
bill
would
authorize
the
possession
and/or
transportation
of
a
residual
amount
of
any
scheduled
or
controlled
substance
for
the
purpose
of
drug
checking.
The
staf f
who
operate
the
City
of
Portland’ s
harm
reduction
services
witness
the
importance
of
accessible
drug
checking
services
on
a
regular
basis.
T esting
for
contaminants
in
the
drug
supply
is
an
ef fective
tool
in
preventing
overdose
deaths;
as
such
these
services
can
and
do
save
lives
on
a
regular
basis.
This
bill
is
a
pragmatic
step
toward
saving
lives
and
increasing
the
chance
that
those
with
substance
use
disorders
will
connect
with
care
and
treatment.
As
partners
of
the
Federally
funded
Project
DHARMA
(Distribution
of
Harm
Reduction
Access
in
Rural
Maine
Areas),
the
City
of
Portland
is
fully
supportive
of
increasing
members
of
the
public’ s
ability
to
safely
submit
samples
to
their
local
harm
reduction
program
for
testing.
Please
support
LD
1745
to
enable
future
overdose
prevention
interventions.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
