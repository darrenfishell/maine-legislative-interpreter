In Support of  
LD 1345, An Act to Permit Municipalities to Establish by Ordinance a Program for Partial 
Deferral of Property Taxes for Seniors  
 
April 12, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offeri ng testimony in support of LD 1345 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest.   
The authority of self-governance is a privilege that the residents of Maine’s 484 
communities take seriously.  No two communities are alike.  Residents are motivated by 
different priorities, principles, and values, which are translated into policies, ordinances and 
charter  provisions that are debated openly and rigorously at the annual town meeting and at 
selectboard and council meetings.   
Municipal government proceedings are open, heavily monitored by media and regulated 
by the requirements of Maine’s Freedom of Access la ws.  They are also conducted at times of 
the day when most residents are available to participate, and through the use of remote 
technology, now accessible at great convenience.  Municipal government is truly an open book.  
It is for this reason municipal officials support the passage  of LD 1345 .  With the 
guidance proposed, the bill provides municipalities an avenue  to implement, administer and fund 
a property tax program that address es the unique needs of the communities they serve.   
Thank you for consid ering the municipal perspective.  If you have questions about the 
Association’s testimony, please do not hesitate to contact me at 1 -800-452-8786 or
