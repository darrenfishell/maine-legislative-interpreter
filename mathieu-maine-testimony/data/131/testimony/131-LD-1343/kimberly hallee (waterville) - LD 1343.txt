I support LD 1343  An Act to Protect the Reproductive Freedom of Maine People by 
Preempting the Field of Abortion Regulation. I am a Registered Nurse, hold a va1id 
ME RN License and provided 43 years of nursing service to the Kennebec Valley 
Region. I firmly believe that the inalienable rights are country is founded on MUST 
INCLUDE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. History and statistics demonstrate Maine 
people have served in record numbers to preserve our Citizens rights, privileges' and 
our Constitution. Abortion Regulation MUST NOT be allowed! ALL MAINE 
CITIZENS MUST HAVE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM as directed and supported  
by their medical team and themselves. 
Thank you. Kimberly Hallee 12 Gray Street Waterville ME 04901
