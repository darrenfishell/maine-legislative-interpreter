Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Susan Sjoberg. I came down today from Presque Isle to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
I was adopted as a baby. My whole life I've been thankful that I wasn't aborted. 
Who wouldn't be? In my 30's, when my birth mother and my adoptive mother met for the first time, after hugging, my adoptive mother's first words were, "Thank you for the wonderful giftl". 
I've been a pediatric physical therapist for the past 36 years. I've worked with 
many children who were premature. Some were born weighing only a pound with many medical issues. Despite their special needs, these children are loving 
vibrant miracles! 
Late term abortions take away these gifts and miracles!!! PLEASE don't let that 
happen. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
