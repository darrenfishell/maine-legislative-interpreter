Hello, my name is Dylan Alley and l work in the kids ministry at my church. l am 
here to talk about how abortion is murder and that’s why this bill should not be passed. 
As a member of the next generation I would like to have my voice heard. 
Now most abortion arguments state that the fetus which by the way is a latin term 
for the word baby isn’t a human but let me ask you, when does it become a human? Is it 
at fertilization when the cells start moving and dividing? How about at week 5 when you 
can hear the heartbeat? How about 11 weeks when the baby is moving around and 
kicking around as well? All these weeks show development and show that this fetus has 
life in it, and the definition of murder is the killing of an innocent life, well what is more 
innocent than a baby in the womb? 
Another augment people make is that the baby isn't fully developed yet. To thatl 
say this, a person never fully develops until they are 25 years old. So let me ask you, is 
it ok to kill a person under 25? No, you would consider that murder. So why is this any 
different from killing a baby in the womb at 9 months, or 8 months or at any point when 
the fetus is developing and showing signs of life. 
Another point people like to make is that a fetus is completely dependent on the 
mother and using the mothers body, so the mother should be able to kill the baby 
whenever she wants to. A baby is always dependent on the mother even outside the 
mothers womb and throughout childhood, so would it be ok to kill a 5 year old who is 
dependent on his mom if his mom finds him an inconvenience? No, you would consider 
this murder, but why is that any different than killing a baby inside the womb at any 
stage? 
My name is Dylan and this is why l believe that abortion is murder, so why are we 
making this practice of murder more convenient for anyone at any time? Thank you for 
your time.
