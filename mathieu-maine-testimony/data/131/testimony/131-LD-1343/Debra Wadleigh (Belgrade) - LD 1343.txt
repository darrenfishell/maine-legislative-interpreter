Statement by 
Debra Wadleigh 
To Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Regarding 
LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy 
Laws 
May 1, 2023 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to present before you. l am Debra Wadleigh, taxpayer and citizen of Belgrade, 
Maine. 
l am opposed to LD 1619. This bill would give Maine one of the most extreme abortion laws in the 
entire country by allowing a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. That ending a living, 
breathing baby's life for any reason is not ok. This is too extreme for Maine. 
l am the mother of an adult child who has special needs. l did not know at his birth and it would have 
made no difference to me, but l shudder to think that I would even have had the choice or that l may 
have been urged to end his life if anyone had known. He has ADHD, Tourette Syndrome, and is hearing 
impaired. In spite of the many challenges he has faced, he has grown up to be a wonderful son, lives 
independently in his own home, with a good job and a full life. We cannot know what the future fora 
baby is if we never give them a chance. 
What are we teaching are children about the ”value of life“ if this bill makes it legal to kill fully 
developed babies that are capable of surviving outside the womb? 
Governor Mills promised she would not expand abortion law in Maine during her campaign but she has 
broken her promise. How can she be trusted after lying by promoting something as extreme as this bill? 
We need to hold Governor Mills accountable for her promises and send a message to our children that 
life does have value. I urge every member of this Judiciary Committee to vote "ought not to pass" on 
L.D. 1619.
