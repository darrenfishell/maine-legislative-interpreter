Statement by 
Penny Morrell 
To Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Regarding 
LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws, 
LD 776, Resolution, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish the 
Right to Bodily Autonomy, and 
LD 1343, An Act to Protect the Reproductive Freedom of Maine People by Preempting the Field 
of Abortion Regulation. 
MwLNB 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee, l am Penny Morrell of 
Belgrade, Maine. 
l am opposed to all three but will speak to LD 1619. l understand that it is the governor's bill to expand 
abortion law in Maine to allow abortion right up until the time of delivery. ln other words, all nine 
months of pregnancy for any reason. This would make Maine one of the worst states in the nation for 
abortion rights, shameful in my view. 
Maine citizens cannot continue to live in lies. To call abortion ‚Äùhealth care" is a lie. Abortion is murder. 
The birth canal isjust geography. Also, do you understand the procedure for partial-birth abortion? 
This should never happen in a civil society. it's murder. 
May we stop living the lie in Maine, and every member of this Judiciary Committee vote "ought not to 
pass" on L.D. 1619 as well as L.D. 776 and L.D. 1343 before you today on abortion. A majority of Maine 
people agree with us and we continue to pray for you.
