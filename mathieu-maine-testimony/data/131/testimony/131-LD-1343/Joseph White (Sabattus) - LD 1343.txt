Madam/Mister Chair and honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My testimony is written from the trenches. My name is Joseph White and I live in Sabattus, Maine.I 
am in strong opposition to LD 1619. I am the father of five children. Three of them are biologic and 
two are adopted. 
We talked to our children about adoption. They were excited but also asked some very good questions. 
Next we asked them if they would like a brother or sister. They all said a sister and one of the boys said 
a brother and sister. We laughed nervously and guess what? A little time passed and we got a call from 
DHHS and they called with a little girl and boy. Our children loved the idea. I will not sugarcoat, there 
has been many challenges along the way but that makes the victories that much sweeter. When I think 
of my children I think of ALL my children. 
If abortion was readily available years ago I probably would not be standing here before you today 
because my grandmother was raised by another family. I am so grateful for that family that stepped in 
and raised her. 
We are huge supporters of adoption and helping others. We respect the birth parents of our children 
who chose life for our little ones. We could not imagine our lives with out them. 
In closing, Iâ€™m asking the Members of the Judiciary Committee, to think about our family that has been 
forever changed by two lives saved. Please oppose this bill. Thank you.
