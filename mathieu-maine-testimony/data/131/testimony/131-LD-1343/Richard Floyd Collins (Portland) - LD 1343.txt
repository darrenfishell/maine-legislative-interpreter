Good morning, I commend your stamina. 
My name is Richard Floyd Collins III, I am a resident of Portland, and I am here to testify in opposition to 
the three bills before you. 
Listening to some of the testimony in support of these bills, it strikes me that the impasse we find 
ourselves at is in the determination of when life begins. 
I believe proponents on both sides of this issue could agree that a "baby" is woith something, worthy of 
life, worthy of protection. I personally would argue that life begins at conception. We spend billions and 
billions each year scouring the galaxy trying to find life, whether a mission to Mars, or drilling towards the 
center of our own planet. I see the headlines regularly. We found life... Life in the form of a new bacteria, 
or strain of virus. Surely what we are here talking about qualifies...But... Even if you don't believe 
conception marks life, certainly a bill allowing the destruction of a fully formed baby on the technicality 
that they are not yet born Ought Not Pass.
