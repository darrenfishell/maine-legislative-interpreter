Senator Carney and Representative Mo.onen, Honorable Members 
of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary:' 
My name is Irene Fancy from Presque Isle and I am here to testify» 
in opposition to LD1619. ,. 
ln"1989;-a younglady found herself pregnant and decided to 
schedule an abortion. Just hours awayfrom th‘e’ab‘t5’rtio”iY 1,' 'a‘ 
woman talked to her about the value oflife. That expectant‘ 
mother changed her mind and gave birth to a baby who is.my.=sen. 
He is now a State Trooper in the great State of Maine. My 
husband and I can't imagine our lives without him and he now has 
two children of his own. _ 
LD1619 is an extreme bill allowing abortion up until birth. 65% of 
Mainers do not want-this. bill. Please listen to the people who 
voted you into office and defeat this bill. 
Pleasevote ought not to pass.
