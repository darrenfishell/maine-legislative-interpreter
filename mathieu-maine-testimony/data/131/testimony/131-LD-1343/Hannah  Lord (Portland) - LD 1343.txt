My name Hannah. I am a Full Spectrum Doula in Portland, ME. I am here today 
speaking for LD 1343. Although we have wonderful reproductive healthcare clinics in
Maine that provide abortion care I also recognize access can be an issue for many 
Mainers especially in rural communities. As an abortion doula I have supported 
multiple clients who have needed to travel long distance so they could access abortion
care. I have even drove with them out of state to clinics in New Hampshire and 
Massachusetts. In 2014 I personally traveled to a clinic in New Hampshire for my 
own abortion because at the time my local clinic  didnâ€™t have an availability for me.  
Any restriction on abortion would make access more difficult than it already is for 
many Mainers. Abortion is healthcare for many Mainers. LD 1343 will help prevent 
further barriers for people accessing abortion healthcare.
