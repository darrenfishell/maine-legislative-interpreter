Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Amy Pray Smith and I am a resident of Durham. I am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
LD 1619 is too extreme for Maine since it would allow abortions up to birth for 
any reason, including aborting babies with disabilities. As a mother of ﬁve 
adopted children with disabilities ranging from cerebral palsy to limb diﬂerence, I 
do not support this bill which sets us back decades as far as respecting the lives of 
people with disabilities. One reason late term abortions are performed is because 
of fetal anomalies detected in the last trimester. Aborting a viable baby because 
they have a disability is saying they are less valuable and don’t deserve to live. It’s 
a form of eugenics. You can ask any of my children if they think they would have 
been better off being aborted. I can assure you; they would all say they are happy 
to be alive. They have fulﬁlling lives and make valuable contributions to our 
community. 
Three of my children were adopted from China, where abortion is available on 
demand up until birth, and where people with disabilities suffer from many forms 
of discrimination. Almost all European countries limit abortions in the 2"“ and 3"‘ 
trimesters and LD 1619 would put us on par with countries like China and North 
Korea. Is that what we want the beautiful state of Maine to be known for? 
I urge you to vote against this extreme abortion bill and show that you value the 
lives of people with disabilities.
