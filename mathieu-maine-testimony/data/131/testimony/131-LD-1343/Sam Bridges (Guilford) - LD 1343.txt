Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Committee Members, 
My name is Sam Bridges, and I live in Guilford Maine. I oppose LDl619. 
Over the years, GOP leadership has been quiet on Abortion. That changes today. I am the Maine GOP 
Vice Chairman. I would love to read a direct quote from the ﬁrst 2022 gubernatorial debate which 
reads: “no, i support the current maine law”. 
This is a direct quote from Governor Janet Mills. During that debate Penelope Overton asked governor 
mills if she supported removing the current viability “restrictions ” . Governor Mills made it quite clear 
that she was NOT interested in changing the viability restrictions and in a short 6 months, she has 
radically altered her position on the lives of our citizens. Governor Mills and speaker Ross have 
decided to put politics over people in order to push forward a “progressive ” agenda. 
Merriam-Webster speciﬁcally deﬁnes the term bipartisan as the following: “marked by or involving 
cooperation, agreement, and compromise between two major political parties” . In the 131 years of the 
terms existence , bipartisan has become nothing more than a buzz word that politicians use to get elected 
and convince the American people that everyone agrees with their agenda. 
I stand before you today, offering a chance for true bipartisanship. Myself, the GOP, My fellow 
Republicans and the multitude of fellow supporters, offer our fellow democrats an 
opportunity for true bipartisanship. Join us in stopping LD16l9 to save the lives of our citizens and 
show that we can achieve true bipartisanship. 
It is sad that We have to testify to defend the lives of the most vulnerable members of our society, but 
given that we are at that point in society, I am honored to be one of the ones standing on the front lines, 
STEPPING UP FOR LIFE and defending it! I am going to close in a prayer to the creator of what we are 
defending today. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
