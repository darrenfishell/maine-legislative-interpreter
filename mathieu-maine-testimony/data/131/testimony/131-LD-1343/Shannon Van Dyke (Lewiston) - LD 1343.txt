Good evening Senator Carney and Representative Moonen and honorable members of the joint 
standing committee on judiciary. 
My name is Shannon Van Dyke and I am from Lewiston. I work in downtown Lewiston asa 
triage nurse in primary care. That means when a woman calls seeking an abortion, they talk to 
me. I am herein opposition to LD 1619. 
The problem with this bill is the ability of the medical provider to determine when it is medically 
necessary to perform a late term abortion. This is too vague and does not protect the 
vulnerable. This bill was drafted to support mothers, as a Frontline healthcare worker, I can 
guarantee you that this bill does not do that. 
The people that I serve do not need another medical procedure to temporarily relieve their 
burdens. These moms need you and I to step up and give them the opportunity to thrive as 
mothers. 
Why doesn't WIC cover diapers or wipes? Why isn't baby formula affordable? Why are the 
wait-lists six months long for psychiatric care for the struggling parent? Where is the affordable 
childcare for the working mom? Where is the paid paternity leave for dads who choose to be 
supportive? Where is the safe, affordable housing for the single mom? 
I advocate on the behalf of the immigrant, the mentally ill, the abused, and those living poverty. 
Do not sweep the burdens that mothers face under the rug in a sterile room in the name of 
medical care. Mother's need support, not a longer time frame for termination. It is time for you 
as legislators and us as a community to step up and come alongside mothers as they raise the 
next generation. On behalf of my people I serve, I ask you not to pass this bill.
