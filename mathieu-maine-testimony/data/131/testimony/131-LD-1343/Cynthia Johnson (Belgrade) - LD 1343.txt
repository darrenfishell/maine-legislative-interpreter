May 1, 2023 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee, l am Cynthia Johnson of 
Belgrade, Maine. 
l am opposed to all three bills before you today but will speak to LD 1619. 
My mother was very ill when she was carrying me! The doctor wanted to abort me! We lived in 
a duplex house and the lady (a Catholic) that lived on the other side of us was standing by 
mom's bedside and said, ‚ÄùYou will not abort this child." The doctor informed my dad that we 
both would die if he did not abort me! If by any chance we lived, l would be very ill and l was, 
until penicillin. 
My mom lived to be 54 and see several of her grandchildren! l am now an 88-year-old anda 
very healthy lady! God has blessed me to be married 68 years and we have three children who 
have given us nine grandchildren and three great grandchildren! My parents gave me Helen as 
a middle name, which was our neighbor's name! We called her aunt Helen as a tribute to her 
stand against abortion! God has been so good! To Him l give all the glory. 
Please vote "no" on L.D. 1619 and also L.D. 776 and L.D. 1343. Thank you!
