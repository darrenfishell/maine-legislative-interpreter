Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary. My name is Stacey Modrusan, and I am a resident of Hermon. i am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
lam a mother of 4 children. I also worked as a Sonographer, aka Ultrasound Technologist, for 19 
years. This included 6 years in Maternal Fetal Medicine, which is for those experiencing a higher 
risk pregnancy. 
l believe abortion at any time, for any reason is too extreme for Maine. lt particularly disturbs 
me that anyone would think it okay to abort a baby who is considered full-term. This bill would 
allow babies that are able to live outside the womb to be brutally killed via abortion. Every 
human deserves a chance at life. An unborn baby at any stage of gestation is a living human 
being. They all deserve the right to live. 
Over the many years in my professional role, I have encountered many different heartbreaking 
situations. Many of these situations also included moments of great joy. I have witnessed many 
mothers and couples who have regretted a previous abortion, or changed their mind during 
their pregnancy and were beyond grateful that they chose life for their child. 
I've also been part of discovering many different genetic conditions and anomalies. I've talked at 
great length with families experiencing these situations, during various stages of their 
pregnancies, and after the birth of their children. I've seen many who were initially upset, and 
over time they realized that their child was a gift regardless. I've seen those who cherished the 
brief time they had with their child, whether it be only during pregnancy, a few moments after 
birth, a couple days, weeks, months. They all mourned the loss of their child. They all knew their 
child was an individual person. 
I have seen babies who have survived premature births, as early as 22- or 23-weeks gestation. 
Yes, this early! This is not anywhere near full-term. I have seen those who were told that their 
child would experience great difficulty in life or even that their child was non-viable. Yes, this 
ended up being the case many times, but there were also those who beat their given odds. Any 
child regardless of any disability is able to bring great joy to others, especially their family. 
Everyone deserves to live the life they were given by God. We have no right to end the life of 
any child. Again, please vote ought not pass on LD 1619. This is too extreme and unwanted in 
Maine. 
Thank you.
