Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary: 
My name is Angelica Barth, and i am a resident of Augusta. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
Forty years ago I became pregnant. As a teen, I was faced with the decision to choose life or death. At 
the time, I was counseled by my family physician. She told me that my unborn baby was a mass of 
tissue. In 2023, we know better than that! 
The decision to abort my child has been one of the largest markers in my life. As a result, I recently 
engaged in a class to help with my healing journey. Yes, an abortion that took place forty years ago 
caused me to get help. Think about that! 
The National Library of Medicine published a December 6, 2021 article on fetal pain perception related to 
surgery and abortion. Based on twenty years of studies, it showed evidence of fetal pain perception as 
early as the first trimester (<14 weeks gestation). But today we are discussing babies in the 2nd and3 
trimester.' 
The methods used to perform abortions range from dismemberment and suction, lethal injection into the 
heart and crushing of the brain. Tell me. Is this civilized? WouIdn’t your support for this bill put into 
question other bills you have supported that protect and advocate for other human lives? 
Maine's current law makes exceptions for a mothers‘ health and life, and medical privacy exists for all. 
Do we really need a law that expands abortion up until viability? Could we not use our voices to promote 
life and adoption? 
You, as our elected officials have the power to choose life or death as l did. The difference is you are 
educated adults, and we live in a time where we know better due to medical technology. 
I implore you to vote No on LD1619. And if you still need more convincing, consider watching a video on 
the dismemberment of infants. 
Please leave a legacy of life! Thank you
