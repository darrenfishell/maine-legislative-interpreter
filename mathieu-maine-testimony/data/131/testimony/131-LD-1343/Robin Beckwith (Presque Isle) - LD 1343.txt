Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Robin Beckwith, and l'm a resident of Presque lsle. l'm here to testify in opposition 
to LD 1619. 
I am a parent of two grown daughters that are parents as well. l have three grandsons and they 
are the greatest joy! Again, l am testifying today in Opposition of LD 1619. This is the most 
EXTREME bill on abortion. Abortion is stealing the life of a baby! 
When l first started having a family it was very hard. My first two pregnancies ended in horrific 
miscarriages. These pregnancies represented babies to me, not tissue. I was very heartbroken. 
When I finally got pregnant the third time, everything was going well. l could feel the baby 
fluttering. 
At a check up, I encountered another young woman who was pregnant and just as far along asl 
was. She asked me if this was my first pregnancy. She then proceeded to tell me that this was 
her fourth child and that she had had three abortions before. She wasn’t sure if she was going 
to KEEP THIS ONE ElTHER!! 
How careless we are with human life. Abortion should not be used as CONTRACEPTIONI 
This bill would make Maine the most extreme on abortion, we don’t want to be known as 
ABORTIONLAND! 
Most Mainers don't want to see this bill pass. Please vote ought not to pass.
