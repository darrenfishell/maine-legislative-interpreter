LD 1343
Dear members of the judiciary committee, 
I am writing to request that you oppose LD 1343. 
The proposal poses great risks for women by placing all responsibility for legislation 
only in the hands of the State. History has made it clear that anytime the state has sole
control over anything, grave misuse of power and authority occur. Our founding 
fathers wisely did not give the States or Federal governments wide ranging authority 
because they anticipated the grave abuses that occur when such authority is granted.
Please protect our citizens and vote no on LD 1343.
