Senator
Anne
Carney ,
Representative
Matt
Moonan,
and
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
My
name
is
Cait
V aughan,
and
I
am
the
Grassroots
Or ganizer
with
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!),
an
education
and
advocacy
or ganization
led
by
grandmothers
and
elders
dedicated
to
advancing
reproductive
health,
rights
and
justice
for
present
and
future
generations.
GRR!
was
founded
in
Maine
in
2013
and
currently
engages
over
500
Maine
activists
across
the
state.
Iâ€™m
writing
on
behalf
of
GRR!
in
support
of
LD1343:
An
Act
to
Pr otect
the
Repr oductive
Fr eedom
of
Maine
People
by
Pr eempting
the
Field
of
Abortion
Regulation
.
T ime
and
again,
Mainers
have
voted
in
favor
of
abortion
access
for
Maine
people.
Across
the
country ,
we
watch
national
and
city
elected
of ficials
bypass
the
will
of
the
people
to
create
biased,
confusing,
medically-inaccurate
campaigns
to
restrict
reproductive
health
care.
In
New
Mexico,
where
abortion
is
legal,
one
city
council
was
heavily
influenced
by
an
anti-abortion
campaign
directed
by
mostly
out-of-state
individuals
and
attempted
to
ban
clinics
in
their
town
1
.
The
confusion
and
chaos
following
the
Dobbs
decision,
and
the
resulting
patchwork
of
laws,
has
led
to
widespread
confusion
for
pregnant
individuals
and
providers.
W e
do
not
want
a
repeat
of
this
murky
situation
in
a
state
where
voters
have
repeatedly
supported
advancing
abortion
access.
This
bill
protects
Mainers
from
deceptive
outside
influences
regarding
reproductive
health
care
and
upholds
state
abortion
law
as
the
only
laws
capable
of
governing
abortion.
It
is
the
right
thing
to
do,
and
GRR!
ur ges
the
committee
to
vote
in
support
of
this
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration,
Cait
V aughan
&
GRR!s
across
Maine
