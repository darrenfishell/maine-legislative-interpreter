Testimony for LD 1619 
l\/ly name is Madyson Curtis. l am from Pembroke l\/laine, and I am here today to ask 
that you vote against LD 1619. This bill goes against what the founders of this nation intended, 
and entirely against God, by making it easier to murder children with no consequences, at least 
none here on earth. I was in Washington DC recently. Carved into the stone of the Library of 
Congress are eggs and spears, symbolizing the protection of life. The necessity to protect life is 
chiseled and carved into the very founding of America. Maine should be a place where human 
life thrives. Maine should be protecting human life, at all stages, whether it be in the schools, 
the hospitals, or in the womb. Thank you for your time.
