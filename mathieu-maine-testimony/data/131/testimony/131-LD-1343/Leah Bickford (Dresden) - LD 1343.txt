Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Leah Bickford, and I'm a resident of Dresden. I'm here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
I'm here today to ask our Maine Representatives to vote "Ought NOT to Pass" on LD 
1619. 
When I was 16, l became pregnant with my son Jayden. As I told people the news l was 
pregnant, I was pressured by many people to get an abortion. I was told I was too 
young. I was told I would never be successful in life and I wouldn't be giving my childa 
life he/she deserved. I didn't want to get an abortion but there was way more support 
from "planned parenthood" and those that like the "convenience" to abort than there 
was support to keep my baby. 
Now, almost 20 years later, I've had a successful career in the United State Military and 
l recruited my son Jayden (who many previously wanted me to abort) to serve our state 
and country by my side. 
LD 1619 isn't about politics or making Maine's voter's and Planned Parenthood happy. 
The voters and organizations that support LD 1619 aren't the Judge of your lives; they 
are also not the Judge of the decisions you're making as representatives of our state. 
The Judge is our Almighty Creator God, who loved us so much he sent his one and only 
Son Jesus to save us from our sins. 
So representatives, as you vote on this bill, I pray you'll consider the lives of God's 
precious children that have the right to live. LD 1619 is a license to murder, nota 
political gain. I'm praying for each of you today and thank you for serving our Maine 
citizens. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
