Hello, my name is Eric Henley and I live in Whitefield, Maine. lam here 
today to oppose this bill LD1619 because the state of Maine doesn't 
even have a death penalty for violent criminals that have committed a 
violent crime. These babies haven't even been born yet and the state of 
Maine is allowing the mother to sentence these babies to death. What 
does that say for the State of Maine that we don't even have the death 
penalty for violent criminals but we allow the death of babies at the 
choice of their mothers and it's a law to allow it? l ask you to really 
think about this. Thank you for hearing my opposition to this bill.
