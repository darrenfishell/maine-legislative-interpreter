Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable 
Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my 
name is Mary Rose Pray and I am a resident of Brunswick. I am 
here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
‚ÄùIf it hadn't been legal, I never would have done it," a neighbor 
told me years ago. Since then, I have heard many post-abortive 
women share their grief and regret. 
"People told me that having this baby would change my life," is 
something else I have heard over the years. "What they didn't 
tell me is that it would be for the better." 
Maine people are known to help each other in their times of 
need. When my sister learned her baby would be born with 
Trisomy 18, she and her husband were offered an abortion. 
They chose newborn hospice instead and were able to spend6 
weeks with my precious niece here on this earth. Her picture 
hangs on their living room wall with those of her brothers. 
As you know, medical necessity is currently covered by Maine 
law. 
If LD 1619 becomes law, Maine would have one of the most 
extreme abortion laws in the country. 
Mainers can do better than that, they want to do better than 
that. Please listen to their voices. 
Mary Rose Pray, Brunswick
