LD 1343 
 
Members of the Committee on Judiciary, this is testimony IN FAVOR OF LD 1343.  
The provisions of this bill would clarify and simplify the context within which the discussions 
about abortion occur. There needs to be a realistic scope of legislation, otherwise it devolves into 
smaller and smaller scales and multiple inconsistencies if not outright contradictions.  
Please pass this bill. Thank you.
