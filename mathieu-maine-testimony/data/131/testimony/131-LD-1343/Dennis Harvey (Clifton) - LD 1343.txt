Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Dennis Han/ey and I am the pastor of a small church in Washington County. I am 
testifying today in opposition to LD 1619. 
As a pastor I have heard many stories from women who regret having aborted a child. Their 
guilt and regret never goes away. It rises to meet them every time they see a baby. It rises to 
meet them in their quiet moments. It rises to meet them even though they have successfully 
brought other children into this world. Abortion sentences many women to a lifetime of pain.

Many have shared that they were lied to. They were told it wasn’t really a child in their womb. It 
was just a clump of ceIls.Later on they learn the truth. They were carrying a separate and 
distinct human being. A child with its own unique DNA. Had they been told the truth, had they 
seen an ultrasound, or understood the miracle of child development, they never would have 
aborted their child. Too late, there's no turning back. There's nothing they can do except live 
with guilt and shame. I am opposed to LD 1619 because of the lifelong harm it does to women 
and the death it causes to the baby. 
I am also opposed to LD 1619 because I am married to a woman who would have been 
aborted had that been an option in Germany in the 1950’s. Instead she was given up for 
adoption to an American couple and allowed the privilege of growing up in this great state.l have 
two sons and ﬁve grandchildren who would not be alive today had that poor, single, lonely girl in 
Germany had the option to abort. I have been blessed to have been married to this 
“throw-away" baby for over 46 years. There is no such thing as a life not worth living. 
LD 1619 is a mistake because it would expand a procedure that ought not to exist. I urge you to 
oppose this bill and allow Maine to continue to be the Way Life Should Be.
