What I saw yesterday is a historic gathering, with young and 
old...uniting as one VOICE saying...We have had enoughll NO more 
innocent bloodshed on our land and on our hands. 
This is where we draw the line in the sand! We the people havea 
righteous indignation towards those that can lie bold face tous and tell 
us that this bill is for reproduction protection, that's not the truth at all 
As we already have women protected under our law. 
We can not and will not remain silent, and just let you folks sign over 
this death decree, hence the 700 plus testimonies you've heard today. 
There is a moral outcry from within these very walls of our state house 
as thousands of Maine residents gathered yesterday and today, From 
all over, waiting all hours of the night to let our voices be heard that we 
do not accept this Late Term Abortion bill! 
We ask you please hear us, Life is sacred, life has Value. We were all 
knitted together inside our mothers womb. That should be the safest 
place for any baby. This bill does not have the best interest of the 
mother or child in mind. This bill will kill one human while leaving the 
other with such emotional scars and damage that that only God himself 
can heal, but this is avoidable. So please do your part to help keep 
women safe and protected from this late term abortion law. 
Please vote ought not pass on LD 1619 \ 
Thank You.
