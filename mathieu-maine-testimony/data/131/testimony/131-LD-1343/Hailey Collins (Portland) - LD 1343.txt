Good morning. My name is Hailey Collins from Portland. 
l amâ€œ 
here to testify in opposition to the bills before you. 
l wanted to start by sharing a song with you... 
The Life You Give Us, Hailey Collins 
Life,.you give us life 
You breathe it into us, you give us life 
You do not need to, but how you love to 
To give us life 
You walk with me here and in eternity 
You give us life, you give us life, you give us life 
l was not just a second thought 
You were not just a second thought 
They are notjust a second thought 
You give us life 
Life is a miracle. You are a miracle. They are miracles. Let them live
