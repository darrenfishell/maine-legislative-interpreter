LD 1343
LD 1343 - An Act to Protect the Reproductive Freedom of Maine People by 
Preempting the Field of Abortion Regulation. LINDA HASKELL, I OPPOSE LD 
1343.
A higher level of government is needed to regulate or eliminate the lower state 
government on issues of Abortion Regulation. This Act LD1343 is over stepping is 
authority on legal decisions and laws of abortion regulation. The time of our State 
Senators, State Representatives, Sec. of State officers and Governor could and should 
be utilized for a more productive State Legislature. The concerns of the State of 
Maine "TAXPAYERS" are screaming for productivity and goverment reform within 
this State of Maine!!!
