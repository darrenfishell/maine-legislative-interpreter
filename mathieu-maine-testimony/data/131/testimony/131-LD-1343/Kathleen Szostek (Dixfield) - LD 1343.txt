Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Kathleen Szostek and I'm a resident of Dixfield. I am speaking in opposition to LD 
1619. It is a drastic overreach. 
lam betting that none of us would vote for a bill —wlthout question and for any 
reason—to kill a baby 10 days after birth. It would be—frankly—unthinkabIe. l can't fathom 
what the difference is with what LD 1619 is proposing. What does it matter WHERE the baby 
lives? In the womb? Or outside? That baby is still a life—no matter where that life resides. 
We can't imagine that a fetus is just a clump of random cells. It is a human being. Life is 
a precious gift from God. The Ten Commandments from God clearly state: Thou shalt not kill. 
You don't honor my God, you say? Even the secular world does not condone killing. 
The abortion question typically focuses on the mother's rights. But, undeniably, there 
are two people involved. And—as a society, we're generally on the side of the most 
vulnerable, those whose voices are obscured. Why is this instance any different? There are 
consequences to our decisions. If we agree to lies or illusion, there is a price to pay. As we 
devalue the unborn further, I believe it will spill over to other areas of life. Crime. The 
elderly. The infirm. 
The current law provides an opportunity for abortion up to the time of viability or in the 
event of a detriment to the health of the mother. There is no further expansion needed in 
Maine. Most Mainers see no need for this draconian law. 
ll 
l respectfully ask you to vote ought not to pass’ . l hope that as a result of what you 
decide, I can quote People for the Ethical Treatments of Animals and say: “Together, we're 
making the world a better place for all beings."
