I am a 76-year-old grandfather and couldn't miss the opportunity to come before you! 
In addressing LD1619, I would like to begin with a Websters Dictionary deﬁnition. 
Expedient: 1) Suitable for achieving a particular end. 
2) Characterized by what is opportune (i.e., good for the moment at hand)- 
Speciﬁcally governed or guided by self-interest. 
This might be ﬁnancial or Political. 
In ancient times the Greeks and Romans, when faced with an unwanted child, often 
female, they found it expedient to take the child to a mountain and expose it. That is, 
leave it there to die being exposed to the cold, or ravaging animals. 
When I was twelve, I met Jewish relatives who still had the tattoos on them from the 
DEATH Camps. The German leadership found it politically Expedient to dispose of the 
Jewish population. 
I have two grandchildren who were born prematurely. In the eyes of some they might 
have been too inconvenient, and costly. They are grown now, are LOVED, and are being 
productive and good citizens. 
Expedient never entered into the equation. Why? 
Finally, when I was in my twenties, I was involved with an abortion of convenience. 
The young lady and I went with Expedience. 
After all, in college, and etcetera, etcetera, And I have regretted it for along time.

after viability.

TAKING HUMAN LIFE TOO LIGHTLY WILL LIKELY TAKE US ALL TO PLACES WE DON'T 
WISH TO GO! 
Thank you.
