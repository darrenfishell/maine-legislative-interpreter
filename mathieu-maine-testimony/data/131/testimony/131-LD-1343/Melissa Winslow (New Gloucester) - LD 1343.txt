LD 1619 Hearing 
Maine State House 
May 1, 202 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonan, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, My name is Melissa Winslow, I'm a resident of 
New Gloucester and l’m here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I oppose this bill in all its measures. 
Of particular surprise to me is the removal of the penalty in this bill for a non- 
licensed person performing abortions. 
We regularly use the language of keeping abortions safe and legal. Are we now 
done with these ideologies? 
in 2019 Governor Mills signed a bill claiming to improve access to "critical 
reproductive healthcare for women across Maine," allowing physician assistants 
and advanced practice registered nurses to perform abortions in addition to 
physicians. 
She said, "Allowing qualiﬁed and licensed medical professionals to perform 
abortions will ensure that Maine women, especially those in rural areas, are able 
to access critical reproductive health care services when and where they need 
them from qualiﬁed providers they know and trust." (Maine.gov "Governor Mills 
signs legislation to increase Access to Critical Reproductive Health Care for 
women”) 
Are we no longer concerned that Maine women have qualiﬁed providers they 
can trust providing delicate health services? 
Why remove the penalties and risk Maine. women being subjected to unqualiﬁed 
health care? 
Why are we removing protection for Maine women by removing the penalty for 
non-licensed people performing abortions. 
This is not a safe bill for Maine women. I urge you to vote ”No." Thank you.
