hello, my name is Sarah King and i am here in oppostion of this 
bill .... .. 
when iwas 18 I myself had an abortion, I was pro-choice for 
many years...,.but what isnt talked about is the regret, trauma 
and guilt I have ieit for all these years after, it never goes away,I 
should have a 24 year old today but I took that childs right to iife 
away from him....Evidence shows that after an abortion you are 
at signiﬁcantly higher risk to commit suicide, have depression, 
have eating disorders, decreased self esteem, nightmares or abuse 
substances after an abortion, We are taking away a human life 
and I feel this is not being taken seriousiy enough. An embryo 
and a fetus is a human, just as the inside of an Eagle's egg is an 
eaglet but if you destroy or hiii that eagiet it is a $5,000 doliar 
ﬁne with up to a year in prison for destroying an eagle egg, 
therefore an unborn eagle has more rights than a pre-born baby, 
animal life is more vaiued than a baby here in Maine. So please 
understand that not oniy does this biii impact the woman and the 
baby it impacts all that surround her and the future generations, 
while abortion may only tahe one hie, it aiso destroys others in 
the process, it is time to inform Women of What it truly is, the 
destruction of iife disguised by the narne ehoiee. Thank you
