Introduction: Hello Senator Anne Carrey, Representative Matt Moonen and Honorable 
members of the committee. My name is Jamie Frankland 
I have always been against abortion, but the week before nine eleven my 
opinion became a realization. When my daughter was in the last week of 
her 6 months of her pregnancy, my grand-daughter, who was born at 27 
weeks, weighing 1 pound and 6 ounces, 12 inches long, (that's 7 sticks of 
butter) this subject of abortion became a personnel conviction. I could 
place her in the palm of my hand, breathe taking experience. She could 
feel pain when they would prick her heal for blood work, she squealed like 
a little pig. She looked at us and smiled within 30 minutes of her birth. 
They could not put a diaper on her because her skin was not developed. 
She needed no assistance in breathing, she breathed on her own and yet 
our society says this is not a baby, this is a fetus. They said she would be 
deaf, blind, have breathing problems, mentally handicapped, probably all 
four and yet today she is perfect. No breathing problems, she is not blind 
or deaf. A year ago, she passed her cosmetology board test in the state of 
Arizona. She has an amazing personality and brightens a room. 
Yet the hospital tried to get my daughter to terminate her pregnancy. 
My daughter had the conviction that only God has that right to determine 
life. There are so many couples who are looking to adopt babies and yet 
we abort babies who could have had a great life for someone who could 
love them. l wonder if there was a video that we could watch of an 
abortion, and wonder if it would change our minds. There would be many 
who would change their minds but there would be many who would still 
believe in abortion, painful abortion to the baby, because there is no 
respect for life. 
I'm sure you are glad that your mother did not abort you. 
O by the way my granddaughters name is Olivia Espinoza, she's 21 and she 
is perfect.
