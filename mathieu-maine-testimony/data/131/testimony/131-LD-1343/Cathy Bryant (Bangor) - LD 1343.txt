Honorable members of the Judiciary Committee. I am Cathy Bryant of Bangor. I am here to testify in 
opposition to L.D. 1619. _ 
Today isn't about whether abortion remains legal in Maine. It's about landing at the very bottom of the 
"slippery slope" if this legislation passes. We aren't speaking about ending all abortion today. That'sa 
discussion for another day. Today is strictly about killing viable, fully formed individuals. Have you ever 
wondered if you would have spoken up in defense of the innocent in WWII? Now is the time to put that to 
the test. When we are speaking of babies that should be joining their cohorts on a baby ward being 
violently killed weeks, days, or even minutes before birth, we have sunk as low as we can possibly go as 
a society. 
No matter how your fellow legislators are voting on this, please take individual action as this is something 
you will be known for and have to live with for the remainder of your lives. You will be on the wrong side 
of history if you vote to pass, just as others found themselves after WWII. Late term abortion brings as 
much pain to a child as it would any of us and our children. 
PLEASE say no to this horriÔ¨Åc legislation, LD 1619.
