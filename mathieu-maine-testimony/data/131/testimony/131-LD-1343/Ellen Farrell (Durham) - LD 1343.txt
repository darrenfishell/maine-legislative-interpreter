Married in 1971, my husband and I adopted our first child, a beautiful daughter, in 
1979. Of the countless blessings associated with this event is the fact that 9 months 
before she was born we learned my mother had called a radio program, “The Bible 
Speaks” , and asked for prayer for her daughter to become pregnant. We feel this was 
God’s answer to those prayers. 
We went to Washington, DC to pick up our second child, our first so excited at the 
prospect. A woman stepped off the plane carrying a delightful 3 1/2 month old boy 
from Korea - a dear source of pride for 38 years. 
Soon an opportunity opened for me to travel to Korea to pick up another daughter. 
She had been left on an orphanage doorstep with some health issues and lovingly 
cared for by Catholic nuns for 10 1/2 months. She smiled and danced when one of 
the nuns sang a song. Dancing and fun come naturally. 
As we grew our family, we remember 1992 and Bill Clinton’s remarks regarding 
abortion, suggesting that it should be “safe, legal and rare” . I wonder, by comparison, 
how “rare” the numbers would be considered today - how inconsequential a viable life 
as a result of this legislation. 
All three of our children have beautiful families today and we continue to be blessed 
with 5 grandchildren and two on the way. Our lives could never have been so full, so 
meaningful. 
We thank God and the three women who shared their gifts with us. 
l ask that judgement and respect for life guide and encourage you to vote against LD 
1619.
