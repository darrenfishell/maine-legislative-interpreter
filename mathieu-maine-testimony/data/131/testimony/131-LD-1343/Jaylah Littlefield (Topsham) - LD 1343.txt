Senator Carney, representative Moonen and honorary members of 
the committee, my name is Jaylah Littlefield and I live in Topsham. l 
am a 19 year old woman, and lâ€™ve lived in Maine my whole life. This is 
my home. And l, along with many others, urge you to vote against LD 
1619. As a Christian, Pro Life woman, i stand against all abortion, and 
see it as it is, which is murder. The lethal injecting, dismembering, and 
skull crushing is taking lives of innocent human beings in a brutal, 
painful, and violent way. And extending abortion access to full term is 
allowing more murder in our state. l will not stand for it. And l know 
that so many others will also stand against this. My home, this state, 
is not a place of murder. 
Please oppose this extreme bill, that many Mainers do not want to 
see pass. 
Thank you
