Senator Carney; Representative lvloonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Virginia Killer, and I'm a resident of Dixfield. I'm here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
As a foster parent for almost ten years, we had many children we cared for in our 
home. One of the children we cared for was eight weeks premature when they 
arrived in our home. The child was very healthy and thrived while with us. The 
thought of someone ending the life of a child that can clearly live and thrive 
outside of the womb is unimaginable to me. 
Late term abortion is murder, many of these babies could lead full, happy lives if 
they are just given a chance. Please vote ought not to pass.
