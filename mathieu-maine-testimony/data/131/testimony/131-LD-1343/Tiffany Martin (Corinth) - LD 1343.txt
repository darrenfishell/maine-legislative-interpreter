My name is Tiffany Martin I am a resident of Corinth, I pray and decree that the stories you 
hear today will soften your hearts and open your eyes to how barbaric LD 1619 is. 
In fall of 2015 my husband and I unknowingly announced to our family the pregnancy of our 
middle son on the same day as his brother and sister in law announced their pregnancy of 
twin girls! My sister in law and I were about a week apart. But in January of 2016 we gota 
call that the twins would be born at 29 weeks due to complications from HELLP syndrome. 
There they were 2 pounds each, with 10 ﬁngers, 10 toes and heart beats, reacting to their 
parents voices. I'm happy to say those babies who looked exactly like the ones who will be 
involved in this horriﬁc bill are now 7 and in the ﬁrst grade with our son, and are thriving! 
And a story with much less of a happy ending, last April at a DC abortion clinic 5 babies 
ranging from 24-32 weeks were found in buckets like trash. I'd show you pictures, butI 
accidentally came across them and it scarred my brain forever. That being said, if you're 
considering voting for this bill, I strongly suggest that you look up the hashtag on Facebook 
Justice for the 5 or ﬁnd the story. If you can't stomach to even look at the pictures you have 
no right to vote to have it done to another person. 
Lastly I'll close with two quotes: 
"When honest people say what's true, calmly and without embarrassment, they become 
powerful." Tucker Carlson 
And 
"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him 
that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the 
sea." And if you know the man who said that and plan to vote for this bill I suggest you get to 
know Him a little better.
