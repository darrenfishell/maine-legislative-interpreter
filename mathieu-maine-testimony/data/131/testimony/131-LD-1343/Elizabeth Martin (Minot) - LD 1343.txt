Senator Carney,_ Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Elizabeth Martin, and l’m a resident of Minot, Maine. As a lifelong Mainer 
and mother to 2 boys, l’m here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
l am pro-life and believe human life begins at conception, which is the generally 
accepted scientific view. The Declaration of Independence states, “that all men are 
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" . The right to life is 
grounded in the biological category of “human,” not in the legal or philosophical label of 
“person” . The idea that a baby can be terminated at any point during a pregnancy, even 
in the 3'“ trimester when the baby is fully formed and can survive outside the womb, 
violates human rights and moral principles. This fundamental human right should be 
protected and preserved by law. 
Maine's current abortion law allows abortion up to the point of viability, which is usually 
around 24 weeks of pregnancy. After viability, abortion is permitted if the life or health of 
the mother is in danger. LD 1619 would allow abortions until birth when deemed 
necessary by a physician. lt also removes the criminal penalties for performing an 
abortion without being licensed as a physician, physician assistant, or advanced 
practice registered nurse and for performing an abortion after the viability of the fetus 
when it was not necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. 
If Maine passes LD 1619, we will have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the 
country, which is what this bill is designed to do, as less than 1% of abortions performed 
in Maine are performed after 20 weeks. instead of being known as “Vacationland _,” if LD 
1619 passes, Maine will become “Abortionland. ” 
Please vote ought not to pass. Thank you.
