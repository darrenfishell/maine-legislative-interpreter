Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Iudiciary, my name is Kelly Weston and I am a resident of 
Corinth, Maine. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
Life is a precious gift. I am a mother of ﬁve and I can say with experience that 
raising children is hard. It is messy. It is exhausting at times. But it is a wonderful 
blessing. I lay my head on my pillow at night and I will admit, there are nights 
where I feel like I blew it--I didn’t say the right thing, I didn’t respond the right way. 
But one thing I don’t feel at night is guilt. 
This word keeps coming to mind when I think about LD 1619 and the 
consequences of abortion. I realize that some circumstances resulting in an 
unwanted pregnancy make it extremely diﬁicult to follow through with the 
pregnancy. But I can tell you, there will never be guilt associated with giving that 
helpless, voiceless child in your womb life. I implore you if you ﬁnd yourself in this 
situation to reach out to your area pregnancy resource center. I implore you to reach 
out to an adoption agency where there are families waiting and desiring a child with 
all their hearts. Abortion does not have to be the answer and I beg our senators and 
representatives to stand up and help those citizens that feel like they have no other 
options to realize that they DO. You will never experience guilt by allowing life. 
Thank you.
