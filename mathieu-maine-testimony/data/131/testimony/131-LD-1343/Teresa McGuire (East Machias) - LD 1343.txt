Madam/Mister & Honorable Members of the Judiciary committee 
My name is Teresa McGuire and I live in East Machias. lam testifying today in opposition of LD 1619. 
I am testifying today because by the worlds standards l shouldn't be here, I was born to a 15 year old 
unwed mother who had been abused most of her life, became pregnant shortly after turning 15, and 
was soon going to either be moved to another state far away or become homeless. Even in the darkest 
moments my mother knew that she could not end my life because it was wrong. She believed and still 
believes that life is sacred. Everyone was telling my mother to get rid of me, even her mother, my 
grandmother was trying to convince her at 6 months pregnant to have an abortion because it would 
make her life better. My mom knew this wasn't true even at the young age of 15. She doesn't regret the 
decision to keep me for a second even though life was tough for her from that point on. This bill will be 
one of the most extreme abortion laws in the country, is this what we want Maine to be known for?l 
don't.
