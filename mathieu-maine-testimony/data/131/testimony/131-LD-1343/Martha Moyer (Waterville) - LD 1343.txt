Senator Carney and Representative Mooney, Honorable 
members of the Joint Standing Committee of the Judiciary, my 
name is Martha l\/loyer, I am a resident of Waterville. I am here 
today in opposition to LD1619. A/50 /.0 77Â¢ M4 up /5%. 
l object to Maine citizens being lied to concerning changing 
the abortion laws. Governor Mills in her reelection debates 
said she was not going to pursue changing the restrictions for 
abortions in Maine. Yet just a few months later she is 
encouraging legislation that would expand the availability of 
abortions, and take away protections for the unborn babies. 
Pro -abortion advocates say they are advocating for women. 
Yet this proposed law will not prosecute those who perform 
abortions, when they are not licensed to do so. Does that show 
concern for a women's health? Are we opening up choices to 
back- alley abortions? 
With this proposed legislation there is more concern and 
protection for baby eagles than there are for human babies. 
Please vote ought not to pass.i 
Thanks for your time.
