All of you, I beg of you to look at an ultrasound of an unborn child; maybe your own 
child, a niece or nephew, or grandchild. This child does not have his or her mother’s 
DNA, blood, heart, skin, thoughts, motions or anything else. The mother’s womb is 
only a place to stay in the interim. Please don’t make it a dangerous place. 
I, myself, Pam Rousseau, had an abortion many years ago. It is a decision I made in 
ignorance and fear. One that still haunts me to this day. I allowed my 13 week old 
child to be ripped from my womb.
That child feels pain, has potential, IS a human being by any scientist standards. 
I beg.. PLEASE BE HUMANE.
