Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen, members of the Judiciary Committee, 
l’m Carroll Conley of the Christian Civic League, and I thank you 
for the opportunity to speak in opposition to LD 1619. Our mission 
statement is bringing a Biblical perspective to public policy. The 
controversy of abortion reveals the conflict of two competing 
narratives. First: we are here by chance and chaos with life 
having no transcending purpose or meaning — - human life’s 
value is subjective and determined by other humans based upon 
wholeness, convenience, or desirability. The second narrative —— 
God created everything including human beings who bear His 
image. Upon creation, we fell in sin and rebellion, but God 
deemed every image bearer worthy of redemption by sending His 
Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins who was raised to life to 
offer forgiveness and salvation. Therefore, every human being, 
regardless of the color of skin, origin of birth, sex, age, size of 
bank account, or number of chromosomes is worthy of our 
respect, love, and defense. 
The League's Pastors’ Advisory board represents every major 
evangelical denomination in Maine: our state’s Bible believing 
churches. The Maine Council of Churches does not represent our 
churches and their people. The denominations represented on 
our Pastors Advisory Board include, but are not limited to 
Assemblies of God, American Baptist, Independent Pentecostal, 
Advent, Christians, Independent Baptist, the Vineyard, Episcopal, 
United Pentecostal, Conservative Baptist, Evangelical Free, 
Reformed Baptist, Orthodox Presbyterian, Church of God, 
Southern Baptist, Wesleyan, and nondenominational churches. I 
urge you to vote not to pass for LD 1619.
