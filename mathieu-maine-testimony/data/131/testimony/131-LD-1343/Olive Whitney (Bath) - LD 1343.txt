Honorable Senator Carney and Representative Moonen and Honorable members of the Judiciary 
Committee, my name is Olive Whitney and l live in Bath, Maine and l am here to urge you to vote 
“ought not to pass" on LD1619.' 
When this bill came out on April 13th, WMTW Channel 8 had Zoey Riech advocating for late term 
abortions. When she was asked her reaction to people saying that abortion is murder, she said, 
"They are dehumanizing the people at the center of their pregnancies." 
My reaction to her comment is... “How can you say that" 
Dehumanizing is to say that a baby in the womb that is moving, has a heartbeat, taking 
nourishment, etc. is not a human. This is denying the true definition of what defines life. 
Britannica.com answers this question... “What is the exact definition of life?" 
“Life is defined as any system capable of performing functions such as eating, metabolizing, 
excreting, breathing, moving, growing, reproducing, and responding to external stimuli. ” 
Let's follow this science...‘ 
—An ultrasound shows the baby is moving and the mother can feel movement.' 
-The baby is eating and metabolizes because there is growth. . 
-The baby excretes urine into the amniotic fluid. 
-There is a heartbeat. 
-And as for stimuli.. 
They feel pain at 22-24 weeks, and at 26 weeks they move in response to a hand rubbed or. 
pushed on the mother's belly. 
So, according to the Britannica a baby in the womb is a life. 
This makes it clear that to allow abortions at 7, 8, 9 months, even up to birth is ending a life 
and is inhumane. I mean, think about it; What are we doing? Who do we think we are that we 
can choose if this baby gets to be born or not. Every pregnancy will end with either a live baby 
or a dead baby. PLEASE say N0 to LD1619.
