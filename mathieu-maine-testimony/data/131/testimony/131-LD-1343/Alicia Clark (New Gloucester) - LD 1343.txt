LD 1619 Hearing Testimony 
Senator Camey, Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name 
is Alicia Clark, and I ama resident of New Gloucester. I am here to testily in opposition to LD 1619. 
If this bill passes oru‘ state will have one of the nnst extreme abortion laws in the U.S. 
The protection of Maine residents, of all ages, especially those who have no voice to speak and cannot protector 
deﬁnd thenselves, that is the unborn, should instinctively and naturally be the goal for any new laws being passed here in 
Augusta. This bill allows for a child that could survive outside the rnothefs wonb to be killed. Medical necessity when 
the liﬁ-‘s of the mother is at risk is already covered under the current law. 
Alternatively, promoting and encouraging adoptions in our State througi state funding is a life—giving, healthy and viable 
alternative to abortion It would 1- serve and foster the health of the family unit and 2- it would strengthen the labric of 
our conmrrii ﬁes. LDl6l9 will do neither. This Bill is not a solution when the end result is the temiination of hurmn life. 
The elimination of a viable human lite conﬁrms the extremity of this bill 
Please consider your vote as a clear choice ofprormting life or death and vote agaimt LD l6l9. The ﬁrture of Maine 
and it’s residents is at stake here. 
Thank-you, 
Alicia Clark 
New Gioucester, Maine
