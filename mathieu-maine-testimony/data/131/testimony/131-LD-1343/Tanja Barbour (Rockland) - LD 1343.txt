Senator Carney and represen_tative Moonen, Honorable Members of the joint Standing committee on 
Judiciary, My name is Tanja Barbour and I am a resident of Rockland. I am here to testify in opposition to 
LD 1619. .I 
I am opposed because abortion at any time, for any reason is too extreme for Maine. This Bill would 
allow babies that could sun/ive outside the womb to be killed. We cannot continue to eliminate our 
future without consequences. Statistic show that the State of Maine has aborted approximately 137,000 
total babies, potential citizens, and of that number over 100,000 citizens were aborted between 1974 
and 2005. They would be 18-49 years old today. That is 100,000 potential Maine adults adding value to 
our communities through faith, the arts, leadership, and the economy to name a few. Jeremiah 29:11 
states, "For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, "They are plans for good and not for disaster, 
to give you a future and a hope. 
Let's look at war for an example. In WW2, We, as a country lost approximately 400,000 of our American 
citizens. In 1983 alone we lost 1.6 million to abortion. That is the equivalent to 4 WW2’s in one year. If 
we agree to late term abortions, we will increase this already huge number. This is a war on our society, 
one we have the ability to control. 
My Faith ﬁghts for life, My God ordained it, and our welcome to Maine sign endorses it. It proudly says, 
”Welcome to Maine the way LIFE should be. However, whether you believe how I do or not, we cannot 
ignore the facts that late term abortion will have a critical impact on our state, our population and our 
future. 
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, and allow all late term babies the ability to have a future and 
a hope..
