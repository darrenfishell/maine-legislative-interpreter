To the Members of the Committee, 
My name is Donna Fitzgerald. l have come to voice my objection to LD 1619, a bill expanding 
the legalization of infanticide to include partial birth abortion. Please reconsider your position. 
In 1993 Maine passed abortion legislation legalizing abortion before viability and by a licensed 
physician. This law also included partial birth abortion if the mother's health was at risk. After 
thirty years, why the change? In an October 2022 debate with Paul LePage Gov. Mills herself 
stated that she supported the current Maine abortion law before changing her mind to pushing a 
no restriction abortion biil involving a barbaric procedure 67% of Mainers don’t want. 
By voting yes on LD 1619, Maine will be on par with North Korea and its government's disdain 
for human life. l respectfully urge this committee to examine your hearts and vote no to LD 
1619. On the Day of Judgement, before the Lord Jesus Christ whom we will all face, you'll be 
glad you did. Thank you. 
Donna Fitzgerald
