LD 1619 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen Honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary. 
My name is Susan Rowland and l live in Lisbon, I am testifying today in opposition to LD1619, An Act 
to Improve Maines Reproductive Privacy Laws. 
LD 1619 is NOT the way life should be. 
Hiding behind the words of this seemingly innocuous bill is an extreme abortion agenda that will 
bring much suffering and death. 
Today I ask you a question: Have you ever killed a baby? 
I have. 
Words fall short of the real life horror of my baby burning to death in my womb when the amniotic 
fluid was removed and replaced with a salt solution. I was 18 at the time and 48 years later the 
memory has not faded. 
At the time all the right words were said, all the good reasons not to bring a child into the world 
were given. In the end l have mourned a death when l should have been celebrating a birth. 
This bill, if passed will lead at least 1 person to end the life of their child - legal killing is very poor 
solution to a difficult pregnancy. Killing one child is one too many. 
Please for the sake of future generations vote LD1619 ought not to pass. 
Thank you for your time today 
Susan Rowland
