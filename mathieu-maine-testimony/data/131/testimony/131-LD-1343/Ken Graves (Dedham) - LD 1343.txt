Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Pastor Ken Graves, and I live in Dedham. I am here in opposition to LD 1619. 
lt is written, it is appointed unto man once to die and then the judgement. 
We will all stand before the Creator of LIFE to give an account of our lives and for what we did 
toward lives HE created. 
Please weigh that in your decision, and let it influence your vote.
