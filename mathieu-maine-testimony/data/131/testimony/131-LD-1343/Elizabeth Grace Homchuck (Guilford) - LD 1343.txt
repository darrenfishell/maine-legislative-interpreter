LD 1343
Dear Judiciary Committee Members,
Please Do NOT pass LD 1343.  LD 1343 removes any abortion regulation in Maine.  
It is unsafe to remove all regulations in ANY medical field and gives special 
protection to abortion procedures.  This removes accountability from healthcare 
providers and puts women at risk without any protection from the many 
complications both physical and Psychological that do occur during and after 
abortions.  Please protect women and do NOT pass LD 1343.
Thank you, Elizabeth G. Homchuck (Guilford)
