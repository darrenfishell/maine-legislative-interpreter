Dear Madam/Mister Cahir & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
Bill LD 1619 
Hello - I am Tammy Blake from Cushing Maine. I am opposed to the way Bill LD 1619 is 
written. Please rewrite it. 
As a teenager in my junior year of high school, I had to decide to have an abortion or take the 
road to raising a child. I choose the child. What a wonderful life we have had, even though it 
seemed bleak at sixteen. 
I understand that not all pregnant women decide that - that is why we currently have safe 
abortion laws in Maine for an abortion up to six months pregnant and further with the health of 
the mother and fetus directed with a licensed doctor. 
I felt my babies moving and kicking long before 7, 8 and 9 months pregnant. I believe Bill LD 
1619 is a dangerous bill that will put the pregnant women at risk without educated doctors and 
increases the death of viable babies. Fetal viability means having reached such a stage of 
development as to be capable of living, under normal conditions, outside the uterus. 
It's a NO to this bill as written. It's an outrage. Please vote NO. I stand for the unborn baby 
who is viable to live - let the babies thrive. Rewrite the bill to cover exactly what you want to 
cover -â€” not being so vague that the bill is a risk to women's health and the life of viable new 
babies. 
Tammy Blake - Cushing Maine
