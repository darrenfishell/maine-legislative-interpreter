Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, My name is Alan lmes and I am a Resident of Waterville. 
I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
In the guise of healthcare for the mother, LD 1619, if passed, would put mothers in more danger. The 
longer a mother waits to have an abortion the greater risks the mother faces. 
Just think of how bizarre this bill really is. The mothers’ water has broken, contractions have started, and 
she has dilated 4 centimeters. She is ready to give birth very shortly and mid-stream decides to have an 
abortion instead. According to this bill it would be fully legal and the mothers’ right to do so. 
Do you really want to expand abortion this far? 
Could we consider, even for a ﬂeeting moment about the possibility that the late term abortion thatjust 
took place could have been a child prodigy, and at the age of 12 developed a cure for Pancreatic Cancer 
which you have just been diagnosed with. 
Who will be the ﬁrst to dissent from the normal party line voting and say with conviction LD 1619 has 
gone too far?
