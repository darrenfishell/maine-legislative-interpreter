Dear Senator Careny, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Mary Fallon, and l'm a resident of Durham. Today I write to express my complete and 
sincere opposition to the legislation change proposed in LD 1619. The expansion of abortion for any 
reason up to live birth and the reduction of penalties for under qualified healthy care professionals 
represents a radical departure for our State. This unquestionably undermines the sanctity of life and 
protection of women. 
Late-term abortions are complicated medical procedures that often involve the delivering ofthe 
children and its destruction upon delivery. The emotional trauma endured by women to feel life within 
them and to participate in the ending of that life is not adequately addressed by abortion proponents. 
Long-term studies have shown the longer the child is carried, the more profound the emotional impact 
ofabortion regret. These women are churned up by a system that pushes one solution only for 
unplanned pregnancy —a solution that leaves deep emotional scars and in some cases permanent 
physical damage. This barbarism is not to be enshrined in law, especially when later—term babies can be 
delivered and given to adoptive families. My husband and l have adopted three children into our family 
and the thought of them being destroyed after being delivered live is chilling. 
This bill increases the potential of harm to the young women of Maine and it poses deﬁnite harm to the 
children they carry. This bill is not for Maine. I strongly urge for LD 1619 to be soundly rejected.7 
Yours sincerely, 
Mary Fallon 
Durham
