Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary:. 
My name is Susan Sleeper, and I'm a resident of Old Town. I'm here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I do not support LD 1619; it is not good for Maine. I am a 65 year old mother of four living children and six 
living grandchildren. 
I regret to say that I have had four abortions, each one in the ﬁrst trimester. 
Children are a gift from God and the hope of our generations. 
I was born in Augusta, Maine. In 1975, at the age of 17 and before my high school graduation, I had my 
ﬁrst pregnancy that ended by an abortion in Maine. 
My decision for that abortion was a reaction out of fear, ignorance, and lack of support. I did not receive the 
inten/entions I needed to help me see things differently. 
Those reasons for my decision remained unchallenged by truth; and as a result, I had three more abortions 
at the ages of 19-26. 
I could not run or hide from the shame and condemnation of my youth. 
It's difﬁcult to say that my four innocent babies suffered a violent, painful abortion procedure. Today they 
would have been in their 40's, the oldest 49. 
I wonder who they would have been. As a grandmother, I will not experience the joy of knowing my 
children's children. 
Society will never experience the contribution of their talents and God—given gifts. 
In Maine, there are approximately 2,000 abortions per year. Maine currently has one of the slowest 
population growth rates in the country. 
How can Maine's growth rate increase with the now proposed laws to make abortion more available? LD 
1619 is not good for Maine. 
This proposed bill will accelerate the deaths of our babies and the annihilation of youth for our future. 
I am also speaking for the grandparents and great-grandparents in Maine. Children are a gift from God and 
the hope of our generations. 
No matter what my excuses were when I was young, or how much I tried to block out of my mind & my 
psyche the reality of having an abortion, it is still a sin. 
Sins invite shame and condemnation. God is Love. He is merciful, kind, and good. He will forgive our sins, 
and give us a new life, if we ask him. 
Jesus is the one who opens the eyes to what Truth is and the joy of our salvation. 
I hope and pray all the people of Maine will decide to choose right, vote right and experience new life for 
Maine's future. Please vote ought not to pass.
