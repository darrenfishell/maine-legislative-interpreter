Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Ariel Wannemacher, I am a resident oflonesboro. I am here today to 
testifyin opposition to LD 1619. 
I am a father of three children, two of which are here today. Both of my parents 
and my brother are also here today to Speak Up For Life. 
I believe LD 1619 is very extreme and lacks respect for human life. To think thata 
mother could terminate her child up to the day before she is ready to give birth is 
unthinkable. 
I believe that laws like LD 1619 demonstrate the lack of reverence for all human 
life. 
I believe that if we do not take a stand today to defend life, the day before 
supporters of this bill themselves would consider that same baby a human, we 
won't have any moral compass to determine what constitutes life. 
Abortion at any time, for any reason is too extreme for Maine. Medical necessity 
is covered under current law. 
As a Maine resident which you represent, I ask you to oppose LD 1619, It does not 
represent me, it does not represent Maine. Please vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you. 
Respectfully, Ariel
