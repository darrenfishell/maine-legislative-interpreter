My name is Courtney, and Planned Parenthood saved my life. 
Now, to most, that statement makes it sound like I was on the verge of death, and PP 
swooped in to rescue me - but that's not exactly what I mean. 
I've known since childhood that I never wanted kids. It's just not in me to feel okay 
raising a whole person and making sure that they don't turn out to be an asshole. 
When I started being sexually active, I always made sure to be careful, use condoms 
(usually the free ones I grabbed after an exam at Planned Parenthood in Biddeford), 
took my birth control pills (also free from Planned Parenthood) and practiced safe 
sex. Then, at 19 years old, my worst fear was made a reality when I found out I was 
pregnant. I thought my life was over... all the plans I'd made, the hard work I'd been 
doing, were suddenly put on hold. 
And then I remembered Planned Parenthood. 
Making the appointment was tough - I was embarrassed and thought I'd be judged - 
but every single one of the nurses and employees at PP were so gentle in their 
wording, and took the time to make sure that I was okay at each step of the process. 
They assured me that everything would be okay, gave me options, and provided the 
help that I needed. 
Without the services that Planned Parenthood provides, myself and thousands of other
women would be stuck in a life they didn't choose. We, as a community, would be 
worse off if those services were taken away.
