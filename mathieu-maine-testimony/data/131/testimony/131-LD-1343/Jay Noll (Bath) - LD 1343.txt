Subject: LD 1619 
This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature." 
Hâ€˜ *i 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Jay Noll and I am a resident of Bath. l am writing to express my opposition to LD 1619. 
We, as a society, value human life and go to great lengths to preserve it. This is especially true when it comes 
to the most vulnerable of our population who are unable to speak up for or defend themselves. l was once 
one of those lives that could have easily been ended many years ago. My mother chose to preserve my life 
and l now have my own children and am a contributing member of my local community. Many children do not 
and will not have this opportunity due to the choice being made for them. I believe this Bill will be bad for 
Maine in many ways, including depriving the most powerless the opportunity to access a basic right: life. 
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration and l respectfully ask that you oppose LD 1619. 
Best, 
Jay Noll
