Testimony of Rosemary Kane 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary: 
My name is Rosemary Kane and I am a resident of Standish. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 
1619. 
We don’t Want to see Maine cheated of its best and brightest future leaders and contributors by expanding 
Maine’s abortion laws to the point of being nearly the most extreme in the country. This is not in Maine’s 
best interest, nor in the best interest of the viable, preborn child. 
Nor is removing the penalties for unlicensed procedures in the best interest of Maine women. Abortions, 
like any medical procedure, are not without risk. It is alarming that this bill, by removing the penalty for 
an unlicensed practitioner to perform abortions, could potentially lead to inequitable, unethical, and 
substandard medical care and increased risks to the vvomen seeking help. 
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill that the majority of Mainers do not want. Please vote ought 
not to pass. 
Thank you.
