Speak up for Life Testimony 
May 1, 2023 
“Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Johnna Thoms and I am a resident of Orrington. I 
am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619.” 
I am opposed because this bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb 
to be killed. 
I have 5 grandchildren who were adopted in the Portland area. Their ages ranged from3 
to 15 years old at time of adoption. Each one of them is special and unique and a gift 
from God. One or all may not have been born if LD 1619 was in place while they were 
in the mother’s womb. 
Abortion at ANY time, for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine. 
Please vote ought not to pass on LD 1619. 
Thank You.
