Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Aaron Husek and I live in Bangor. I am a parent of 1 daughter and I am 
testifying today in opposition of [LD #1619]. 
I am testifying because if this bill is passed my daughter later in life or anyone else 
deciding to get an abortion, could go to someone that is not reputable and isn’t properly 
licensed by the state and having no consequence against them. It would be like me ifI 
didn’t have a drivers license and was pulled over for a traffic infraction and having no 
consequence for not having one. 
Also, changing to the discretion of the Healthcare provider, and taking away, the 
previously stated, preserve the life of the mother, leaves it wide-open for the possibility of 
legalized murder of a baby that could possibly othen/vise live. 
Our own governor Janet Mills stated she felt Maine's law didn't need to be changed and 
now this. It is wrong, it is Immoral, the law as it is now doesn't need to be changed. I 
urge you to not let it pass. Thank you.
