PERSONAL TESTIMONY LD1619 
Good day. Thank you for the opportunity for me to bring my testimony to you 
today. I appreciate your time, energy, and devotion to all that you do for our state and 
our country. 
Today is a tough day. There will be citizens providing testimon for, against, and 
indifferent towards the subject matter content of abortion. I am here to provide 
testimony AGAINST the passage of LD1619. 
I realize this bill was presented in a amost shocking and extreme way, perhaps in 
order to force and create dialogue to speak about the abortion issue. 
Well, here we are. Small in numbers within these walls today in comparison to 
the vast numbers of people outside this room who feel the same as I do because most 
good folks are working jobs they cannot take time off from, school classes they must 
attend, poor health that does not allow them to bephysically present and with us today, 
and a myriad of other good reason. Nevetheless, outside of this room and legislative 
body all who would have an opinion speaking out against the passage of this bill have 
voices that will be loud, especially on Judgment day. 
There are many valid debate points on both sides of this very important issue 
and ultimate decision today, but due to the understandable timing constraints I will 
touch on a short list of points. 
I spent twenty years in the military fighting for others’ freedoms and, not trying 
to appear melodramatic, signed and took an oath willing to die for this country and it's 
people because I love this country so very much. I was willing to fight for myself and 
others‘ to have the privilege and chance to pursue freedoms and LIFE for those too 
weak to fight for themselves here in America and around the world on their home soil. 
Today I fight for what is a valuable life within the womb as those who would be future 
American citizens. So now, apparently, I am fighting for those precious to America who 
cannot voice for themselves from within the womb. 
The truth about late—term abortions in the United States is abortions are very 
rare. According to Pew Research Center, a study was conducted that contains a 
plethora of statistical data including quantitative figures and facts. "In the District of 
Columbia, New York City, and the 46 states that provided abortion and residency
1
information to the CDC, 9.7% of all abortions were performed on women whose state 
of residence was known to be different than the state when the abortion occurred- 
virtually the same percentage as in 2019 (9.3%). (PewResearch.org/short- 
reads/2023/O1/11/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-u-s-2/). "ln the 46 states 
that reported data to the CDC in 2020, the majority of women who had abortions (57%) 
were in their 20's, while about three-in-ten (31%) were in their 30's. Teens ages 13 to 
19 accounted for 8% of those who had abortions,j while women in their 40's accounted 
for 4%." (PewResearch.org/short-reads/2023/O1/11/what-the-data-says-about- 
abortion-in-the-u-s-2/). Perhaps the most glaring statistical data from the Pew Center 
Research stated, "The vast majority of abortions occur during the first trimester ofa 
pregnancy. In 2020, 93% of abortions occurred during the first trimester - that is, at or 
before 13 weeks of gestation...an additional 6% occurred between 14 and 20 weeks of 
pregnancy, and 1% were performed at 21 weeks or more of gestation" . 
(PewResearch.org/short-reads/2023/O1/11/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the- 
u-s~2/). JUST 1% ACROSS ALMOST THE ENTlRE UNlTED STATES AFTER 21 WEEKS 
(PewResearch.org/short-reads/2023/O1/11/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the 
u-s-2/). This 1% does NOT speak for the majority of cases per the research and data nor 
does it speak for the overwhelming majority of Americans who have undergone 
abortions procedures. Additionally, "these CDC figures include data from 40 states and 
New York City (but not the rest of New York). About 2% of all abortions in the U.S. 
involve some type of complication for the woman, according to an article in Statpearls, 
an online health care resource. The article says that ‘most complications are considered 
MINOR such as pain, bleeding, infection, and post-anesthesia compIication" . 
(PewResearch.org/short-reads/2023/01/11/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the- 
u-s-2/). in 2018, according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute at lozierinstitute.org a study 
demonstrating Gestational Age, late term abortions reported across the United States 
showed the state of Maine's number at ZERO, no late-term abortions.

ABORTIONS across the United States are late-term abortions. Even though abortion isa 
highly contested subject matter, the truth is all the noise and hell-raised does not 
negate data, of which l am confident there is much more out there to substantiate my 
position, that claim late-term abortions are, indeed, rare across the entire United 
States. 
The first thing that came to my mind when I learned of this bill being presented 
was concern of the unborn, obviously. In my opinion, it is murder. In my opinion, there 
are many people who use abortion as a birth-control method. Time and again they
2
murder an unborn child for the sake of birth control. At

_M i'}“Z;i _(i;_Qi§_@;7_ Qi §j_§id~§>_3»l":3§~§§a{Q;lg§\§§S,/ , the opening paragraph states, "Despite Americans ‘ 
opposition to the idea, some women have admitted to using abortion as a method of 
birth control. The article goes on to substantiate it's assertion by mentioning a new 
report by the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute. This is quantitative and qualitative 
data and content collected from pro-abortion facilities. 
A child who exists within the womb with feeling and awareness as open heart 
Surgery‘ At the Source, §1il§tZ§iZ£{l ..1?}i;!ll.l§; ‘V§=?l@ii.§i.13ii.ii3§;.QLi7i.Z_i €?iU.%?.3Tl?¥:1E%i§z§§.§?5/§%3 €;?_%e1.!L:%§fi"¥:Oi".t.

unborn son, Rylan, about 10 weeks before she gave birth. Deeply anesthetized, Sam 
underwent a fetal interventional surgery at Cleveland Clinic on May 7, 2021, during 
which Ryan's arms and shoulders were gently lifted out of ehr uterus while his head 
remained inside....enabling (doctors) to gain access to the chest of the 26-week-old 
fetus...to (perform) a life-saving procedure by removing the tumor growing on his 
heart" . Look at the headline and consider the doctors’ surgical team, peforming LIFE 
THREATENING surgery on this baby, this human being. LlFE. The baby IS LlFE, a living 
person. 
Almost 23 years ago, an image of a 21 week-old fetus diagnosed with spina 
bifida and having innovative, prenatal corrective surgery circulated the world showing 
the fetus‘ small hand and fingers reached out from the womb and grasped hold of the 
doctor's finger. The entire story to include the medical miracle and clearly 
demonstrating LIFE of awareness and comprehension, even subconsciously, is found 
within several resources, but a brief synopsis is located at

is now a healthy individual living his life. LIFE. 
To allow passage of this bill will endanger women who will have the ability to 
have an abortion outside of medical supervision by certified doctors and medical 
personnel which, to me, brings back memories of hanger abortions in backstreet alley 
passageways and other unhealthy, unsupervised competent medical personnel in case 
something goes wrong with mother and child. 
Without going into extreme detail and further debate here, the thought crossed 
my mind that we are on the verge, the cusp of deciding who is more important, a 
potential American future citizen or those who come across the border illegally. Are 
you willing to let illegals cross the border and immediately receive more rights than an
3
unborn AMERICAN ClTlZEN just waiting for it's opportunity to be born? Seem illogical to 
me and it could give the perception and appearance to many, many others here in the 
State of Maine as well as the other 49 states that legislators and The People give 
precedence to illegal foreigners over our very own future citizen American babies who 
are decided to be expendable and non-existent should you pass this bill. It's murder. 
Choose LIFE, please. 
This is not a political party question or dilemma; it is a HUMAN BEING and 
MORAL question and dilemma. It is arguable that America's morals have been on an 
increasingly steady decline over the years. Please do not make the mistake of 
compounding the issue and feeding the senselessness of a lost moral compass for the 
1-2% who desire late term abortions or the rest of the pro-abortion supporters whose 
abortion reasoning does not fall under acknowledged situations such as rape, incest, 
etc., to have an abortion procedure performed. Please do not expand the parameters 
of individuals getting abortions by opening up a wider, longer time frame for them to 
seek dangerous abortions. 
The origins of the case presented in support of this bill are suspicious to me.l 
realize HIPPA and Pii are involved so details may be limited. Yet, was the decision fora 
person to travel outside of the State of Maine for her abortion due to personal choice 
to travel under the guise of "no doctor would perform the abortion in Maine" because 
of a political agenda or because most doctors know and understand late-term abortions 
might be high-risk as well as rare and they were unwilling to perform the procedure 
anyway? Just 1% to 2% across the entire United States for late-term abortions. LIFE; 
please choose LIFE. 
Please do NOT pass and approve LD1619. 
Lastly, the sensational question that can be posed and thoroughly pondered; 
"What if your mother had aborted you"? 
Thank you for allowing me to speak and have a voice today. 
God bless you all with insightful, dutiful wisdom and action while determing this 
poor, devastating, and tragic bill's proposal. 
Semper Fidelis,
