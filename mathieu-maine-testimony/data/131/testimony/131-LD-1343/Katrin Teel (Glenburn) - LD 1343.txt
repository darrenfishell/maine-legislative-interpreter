As you know, if passed, L.D.1 _619 would expand abortion access right up to the point of birth for 
any reason, (thus allowing a baby that could-survive outside the womb to be killed, like my_ 
neighbor ’s 5-year-old twin boys, born at 26iweeks and thriving beautifully). This bill,would 
make Maine's abortion laws among the-most extreme in the nation. _i

Current law addresses viability. Current law already allows for medical necessity in case of 
stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, etc. Over‘65% of Mainers don't want late-term abortion. / 
L.D.1619 is beyond abortion, it is infanticide. lt is heartbreaking to think that the Governor of 
Maine would even conceive of such a thing, so radical, heartless, and extreme. This bill is an 
embarrassment and a disgrace to the state of l\/lai _ne.l
\ 
Toward that end, l encourage you to vote no on L.D.1619. Themajorlty of Mainers do not want 
to see it pass. Thank you for allowing me to contribute my testimony.
