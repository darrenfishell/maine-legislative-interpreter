Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable 
Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, 
my name is Gail Hackelberg, and l am a resident of 
Ellsworth. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
The current law permits abortion until the baby is able to 
sustain life outside of the womb. This happens 
approximately 24 weeks after conception. There is already 
a law in place to protect the mother if an abortion is 
deemed medically necessary after that time period. 
Governer Mills herself stated in her campaign that she had 
no intention of supporting changing the current abortion 
laws. 
If any of you have children or grandchildren and have held 
them the day that they were born, can you imagine 
allowing someone to murder them that very day before 
they came out of the mother. So much medical research 
and advancement in technology has been done to 
preserve these little lives. If a baby is born weeks 
prematurely, everything possible is done to keep that baby 
alive and healthy. How can we as Mainers think of ending
1
a life that is ready to live independently so callously when 
so much effort has been made to preserve a life that is 
not yet ready to survive on its own accord? 
As a Registered Nurse I have visited the Neonatal Intensive 
Care Unit at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. I 
have seen babies that would be candidates for this bill if it 
were to pass. To harm one of these helpless babies would 
be barbaric. It is our job to protect the children, not 
murder them. 
lam asking you to search your heart and soul, and oppose 
this unnecessary, drastic bill. Thank you.
