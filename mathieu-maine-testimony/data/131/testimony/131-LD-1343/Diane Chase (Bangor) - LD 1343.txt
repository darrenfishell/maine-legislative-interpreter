Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on J udioiary: 
My name is Diane Chase, and I’m a resident of Bangor, Maine. I’m here 
to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
To live is an essential right and I am grateful for my life and my family 
and friends’ lives. AV 
This bill goes beyond reasonableness and is dishonorable to the people 
in the state of Maine. 
Please vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you.
