Human heart beats at 21 day, biological fact 
at 41 weeks cells of baby circulates throughout mother and baby, after baby is born, these cells remain 
in mothers body, leavinh a permanet imprint in the mothers tissues, bones, brain, skin and stays there 
for decades , each child the other carries will leave their imprint.. a life made permanent in the mother 
womana body is amazing at some point she may have 2 heads 4 hands 4 legs 2 different beating hear2 
different DNA// a separate life within the mother 
there are many support groups and many couples who want to adopt 
a baby is big enough to live, but to small to speak... let us be the voice for life 
Respectfully, 
Mrs Anna Cecero
