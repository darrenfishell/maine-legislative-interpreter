Maine State Legislature Public Hearing on Abortion Rights 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary. 
My name is Barbara Merriam and I live in Stockton Springs. 
Thank you for your consideration and service to the people of Maine. 
I am a mother, grandmother and great grandmother. 
I am testifying in opposition of LD#l619 
A 15 year old junior in high school realizes she is pregnant. Her body, emotions and mind are not 
mature enough to even realize what all is ahead of her. The word “abortion ” is not even on the radar in 
this small Maine mill town. 
When the 81b baby boy is placed in her arms, her eyes focus on his little ﬁngers. She remembers her 
ﬁrst Christmas baby doll as a little girl and how she loved it. These ﬁngers move and belong toa 
human child. 
I was there at his birth with tears in my eyes, and tears as I cried scattering his ashes over our blueberry 
hill 40 years later. I have sat beside my dying husband, and beside my youngest child as they took their 
last breath. 
Life is precious, no matter the circumstances. SACREDNESS and DIGNITY of human life should be 
top priority for this state and our government. 
Please oppose this billi! 
Thank you.
