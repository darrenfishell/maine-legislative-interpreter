Re: Testimony in OPPOSITION to LD 1619, An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members ofthe Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Jessica L. Laliberte. I am a resident of Waterville and a lifelong Roman Catholic. My Catholic 
faith has always been my guiding principle and moral compass. Life begins at the moment of conception 
and ends at natural death. 
I vehemently oppose LD 1619, An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws as well as the 
other two abortion bills LD 776, Resolution, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to 
Establish the Right to Bodily Autonomy, and LD 1343, An Act to Protect the Reproductive Freedom of 
Maine People by Preempting the Field of Abortion Regulation. 
Children are some of our most precious assets. They are also some ofthe most vulnerable. Many times, 
in this building, we hear all lives matter. LD 1619 is a vile, egregious, and vicious attack on human life. 
If passed, this legislation would allow the execution of an innocent, defenseless baby right up until the 
moment of birth. That is murder. If you support this atrocious bill, you will have the blood of murdered 
babies on your hands. 
Many of the bill's sponsors and co-sponsors oppose harsh penalties on criminal offenders and oppose 
the death penalty because they believe people deserve a second chance and rehabilitation. LD 1619 
ends the life of a baby. 
I beg you to do the right thing and vote ought not to pass on these bills.
