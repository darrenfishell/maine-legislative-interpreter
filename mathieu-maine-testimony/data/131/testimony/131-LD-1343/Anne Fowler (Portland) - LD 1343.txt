Seek justice, love mercy, walk humbly with your God, says the 
prophet Amos of Hebrew Scripture. 
Good morning. I’m the Reverend Anne Fowler, a native Mainer, 
and an Episcopal priest. Advocating for women’s health and 
reproductive freedom has been my calling for 40 years. I have served as 
a chaplain and counselor to many women making decisions about 
whether to have an abortion. Most of them already have children, many 
of them are poor, some are living in shelters or rehab facilities. They all 
need safe, affordable healthcare, and that’s what abortion is. Healthcare. 
Yesterday, in churches across the country, Christians heard Jesus 
say, I came that you might have life, abundant life. Jesus did not come 
that women and doctors might live in fear of violence or jail. Jesus did 
not mean, have many children. He did not mean only women of means 
or only women who live in certain geographic areas should have 
abundant life. He meant everyone. 
He meant, Seek justice, love mercy, walk humbly with your God, and you 
will have abundant life. Justice, kindness, and humility. On the basis of 
those ideas, I urge you to pass LD 1619 and Ld 1343. Thank you.
