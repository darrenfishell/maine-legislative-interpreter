Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable 
Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Rita Fontes, and I'm a resident of Kennebunk. I'm 
here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I am very concerned that bill LD1619 will be passed! Abortion 
affects many lives! It has deÔ¨Ånitely affected mine! I did not 
realize that aborting my child would bring me years of 
emptiness and sadness. I so wish I had had the child and given it 
a chance to live. Adoption would have been a better option 
than taking a life! The option of abortion should not exist! 
Women need to be told the avenues available to them for 
assistance in keeping their child alive. 
The issue of this bill is a woman's right to choose. What about 
the baby girl in the womb? Doesn't she, who one day will bea 
woman, have a right to choose? 
As an elected public official, you stand for the best interest for 
all persons. The unborn is a person! Please represent this 
person! Please help women! Help them make a decision that 
will bring them peace in doing what is right for their child. 
You know in your heart what is truly right! I trust you to be fair 
and just for all. 
Please vote ought not to pass. 
In all sincerity, 
Rita C. Fontes
