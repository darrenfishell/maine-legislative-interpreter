I am choosing to testify today to oppose LD 1619.
Abortion, for most people this word is taboo. It's the elephant in the room that no one 
wants to discuss, but for many women it represents a significant moment in their life. 
Whether you have experienced an abortion yourself, supported a friend, or 
contemplated an abortion, it's impacted your life forever.  I am grateful to be included
in the second group.  However, I have watched the toll that abortion has had on my 
friends;  Wondering with each passing year what their baby would look like, or who 
they would have been.  Some of these beautiful women went on to have families and 
children after their abortion, and some could not.  In either outcome, there is a void 
left.  Society wholly recognizes the anguish of a parent losing a child, but somehow 
collectively we choose to ignore the parallel cost to a mother of an aborted baby.  In a 
time that we are so plagued by mental illness, I find it baffling that the long term 
effects of abortion on a mother are not a major talking point.  Seemingly we are stuck 
on the here and now costs: what will people think, how will my body change, and of 
course the almighty dollar- I can't afford a child.  Seldom is a step taken back to 
reflect on what should be the priorities.  With all of society screaming with 
expectations, who could resist the mainstream solution, "get rid of the problem". In 
1973 our Country was proposed a safe and rare solution to unthinkable situations.  50 
years later abortion is anything but rare; I would also argue the word safe, if we 
examine the true impact on the mother and baby. I tremble to think what our state 
might look like in the future if this legislature is passed. This will be a line in the sand
for our future, and specifically for each politician voting.  I pray the voice of the 
people is heard, and that our elected officials have the fortitude to stand in the gap.
