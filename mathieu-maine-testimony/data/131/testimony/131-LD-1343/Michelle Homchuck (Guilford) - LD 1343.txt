LD 1343
Dear Committee Members,
Please Do NOT pass LD 776, 1343, or 1619.  LD 1343 removes any abortion 
regulation in Maine.  It is unsafe to remove all regulations in ANY medical field.  We 
should not give special protection to abortion procedures.  This removes 
accountability from healthcare providers and puts women at risk without any 
recourse.  There are many complications both physical and Psychological that do 
occur during and after abortions.  Please protect women and do NOT pass LD 1343.
Thank you, Michelle Homchuck (Guilford)
