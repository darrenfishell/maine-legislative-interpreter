Freedoms are things that exist without infringing on the freedoms of others. 
'Reproductive freedom,' as it is called here, infringes on the rights of those who have 
no voice, namely the unborn. To extend the 'right' of one to take the life of an unborn 
baby is to participate and be culpable in one of the greatest, if not the greatest, 
atrocities in our generation. I, and many in the state of Maine, along with me, oppose 
this so-called 'reproductive freedom.' Please consider the lives of the unborn that are 
being denied freedom by your decisions.
