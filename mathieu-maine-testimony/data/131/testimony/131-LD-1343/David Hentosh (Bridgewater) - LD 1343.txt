I understand that you are hearing testimony on a bill allowing late term abortions.  As 
the uncle of a baby born prematurly, at 24 weeks, who is currently healthy and living 
at home with his parents, I feel like I must share my opinion on this matter.  
Without blurring the lines of where the rights of the mother, father and unborn cross, I
can not see where allowing abortion, especially past the time of (fetal viability), is 
anything other than murder.
I am not one who often writes to my local senator or representative but in this case 
feel that if I at least do not let my voice be heard then, I am guilty of every unborn 
childs death that would take place should this bill pass.
I strongly urge you to vote that this bill ought not pass.  Surely there are other options 
available for these cases and maybe a bill to improve adoption options and process are
in order.  
Respectfully,
Dave Hentosh
