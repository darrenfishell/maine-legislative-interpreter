"Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary. 
My name is Mary M. Boie and I live in Topsham. I am testifying today in opposition of LD1619 which 
would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be KILLED! Abortion at ANY time, for ANY 
reason is too extreme for Maine! 
On a personal note I have a member of my family that was adopted and I wanted to tell you that I am 
so thankful that his mother did not kill him. 
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want to see pass. 
Thank you.
