Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the joint standing 
Committee on Judiciary, I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. My name is Jody 
Raio and I reside at 19 Ivanhoe Drive in Topsham. 
I find it embarrassing that I and so many Mainers have had to make a trip to the State 
House to defend the greatest gift of aII- Life. The word of God says we are fearfully and 
wonderfully made. It says we are made in Godâ€™s image. That means every person that 
God created reflects Him as a perfect Creator. But today I am before a legislative body 
that I fear may be far removed from this basic truth. So I am here to defend the most 
innocent and vulnerable in our society. The big question is how did we get to this point? 
The word of God says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. So it is the lack of 
fear for God Almighty that leads down this slippery slope until a people has come into 
agreement with the murder of a viable child. This is the most gruesome bill I have ever 
read. I question is this how Maine will be known throughout the nation and world? On 
the other hand, this bill has unified pro-life and pro-choice proponents more than any 
other bill. Personally, I know not one pro-choice supporter who agrees with the killing of 
a child in the third trimester. In my research there is not one case in which this would be 
necessary at saving the mother. In fact, a C-section is how situations involving harm to 
the mother has been handled up until now. What I do know is that the organs of these 
precious babies is incredibly valuable. There is much literature on this available to the 
public. I pray that everyone who is considering supporting such legislation would turn 
away from such evil and stand with the children which are our future and joy. I pray that 
fear of God come upon this State House. In Jesus Christ name I pray. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
