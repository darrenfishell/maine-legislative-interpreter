TESTIMONY OF ANDRE LEVESQUE. 
ln opposition to LD 1619 
“An Act to improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws” 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
Sponsored by Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross 
Public Hearing May 1, 2023 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judicialy. 
My name is Andy Levesque |’m a resident of Gorham, l am a dad, a faithful Catholic, a member of the 
Knights of Columbus, and a board member of Maine Right to Life. 
l am testifying in opposition to LD 1619, an act that would allow the killing of a child even at the 
moment of birth. 
Abortion at any stage of a mother's pregnancy should not be taken lightly. 
You will hear eloquent testimonies from pro-choice advocates that describe the absolute necessity of 
having an abortion “ON DEMAND”. 
Allow me to be an advocate for the child whose life you are about to vote on. 
At 21 days, after conception, the heart begins to beat. _ 
At 52 days, the arms and legs move, the head turns and the mouth opens, yawns and is sucking. 
At 11 weeks. the baby “practices ” breathing, vocal cords and taste buds form, and he or she urinates. 
At 4 ‘/2 months, it's important to note that the baby FEELS PAIN. 
Any attempt to abort at this stage will cause excruciating pain. 
An abortionist will tell you that the baby reacts to being prodded during this stage. 
lt was about this time that my wife and l had our first miscarriage, and we would often think about our 
little boy. 
LD 1619 is an extreme attempt to terminate our precious children, even my Democratic and 
independent family and friends think this late term abortion bill goes too far and is morally wrong. 
This doesn’t reflect the principles and values of the majority of Mainers. 
Please consider opposing this terrible legislation and vote ought not to pass.
