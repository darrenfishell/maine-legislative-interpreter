Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary: 
My name is Kimberly McNaughton, and I’1n a resident of Carmel. l’m here to testify in opposition to LD 
1619. 
I’m here today in opposition to the LD1619 bill and I ask that you please consider these thoughts 
sincerely. 
The bill being proposed is too vague and too extreme for the state of Maine. The current law already 
covers women who seek abortions, at any stage, out of medical necessity. If there are medical reasons not 
covered under the current law, then those should be discussed and requested to be added as an exemption. 
Governor Mills herself stated, when she was running for re-election, that the bill used today is ﬁne as is, 
and she had no intention of changing it. This is not What Mainers want. Please do not allow this bill to 
move forward. 
Please vote ought not to pass. Thank you
