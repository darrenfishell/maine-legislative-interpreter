Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, LD 1343 - “An Act to 
Protect the Reproductive Freedom of Maine People by Preempting the Field of 
Abortion Regulation”, May 1, 2023.
Representative Supica, Senator Brenner, Representative Copeland, Representative 
Eaton, Representative Mathieson, Representative Rana, Representative Reckitt, 
Representative Stover, Representative Warren and Members of the Committee:
My name is Katherine Martin. I am testifying in support of LD 1343.
I believe this bill is critical for the State of Maine to firmly establish set law in view 
of the Supreme Courts decision that the rights allotted to women regarding their 
health and reproductive decisions be determined by each state’s legislature.
As a citizen of Maine, and of the United States I fully support the state of Maine 
‘occupying and preempting the field of legislation concerning regulation of a person’s
decision to terminate a pregnancy and legislation concerning the practice of abortion’.
It is my hope that doing so will protect Maine citizens from the overreach of outside 
organizations.
Thank you for this protective piece of legislation. I shall hope it passes.
Katherine Martin
Knox, ME
