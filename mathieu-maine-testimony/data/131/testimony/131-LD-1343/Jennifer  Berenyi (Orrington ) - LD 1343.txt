I appose this bill. I am 28 weeks pregnant with my little son I feel his little kicks all 
day and am reminded that he is his own person with a personality already forming all 
his organs can now function on their own! Life begins at conception all life is 
precious I believe that the mothers womb should be the safest place in this world, but 
it is now one of the most dangerous I ask you to please take a stand to protect and 
save these children. Jesus Christ died for all. Including each precious soul, that has 
not yet been born into this world.
