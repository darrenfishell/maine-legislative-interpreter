Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Patricia Halpin, and I'm a resident of Newport. I'm here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
lam Pro-Life. I am a mother of two grown children; one of my children was born 
at seven months and the other child was born via cesarean section. I must say 
abortion at ANY time for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine; and if this grievous 
bill LD1619 passes Maine will have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the 
entire country. 
This bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. 
Thou shall not kill. (Exodus 20:13) 
Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion for the child 
she has borne? (Isaiah 49:15) 
I plead with you: Do not pass this horrific bill. 
Please vote ought not to pass. Thank you.
