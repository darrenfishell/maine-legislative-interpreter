I am a mother of 8 children, 2 biological 1 stepson and 5 adopted. This hits home as a 
Maine resident and as a mother. You all should be thanking your mothers today for 
being pro-life. What have our state or country come to this sick heinous act of murder 
on our unborn children. We are all here today because our mother's granted us life. 
Many were from a time where healthcare was not free, Food assistance was from the 
back of a tractor trailer.
 Horse-drawn for quartered is the brutal forms of execution practiced in the past. It is 
from the past? no still happening today. It's the same practice performed by doctors 
when the fetus is removed from the womb of a woman. The child feels every bit of 
that pain, as each part is ripped from the body. Why are these barbaric practices still 
happening today? because we have become a society that cares more about 
themselves than about their children. Today is it a fetus tomorrow it will be our 
children 18 and under too killing our elderly parents who gave us life. What point 
does this stop? It stops today!! we are not sitting down and excepting is form of 
mental illness.
