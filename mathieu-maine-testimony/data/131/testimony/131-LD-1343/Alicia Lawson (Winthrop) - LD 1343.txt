My name is Alicia Lawson, I’m a mother of 5, a resident of Winthrop and I’m here to express my 
sincere opposition to LD 1619. 
Approximately 20 years ago, I stood up in front of my high school classmates and spoke out 
about the gruesome practice of partial birth abortion. Who knew that years 20 later, I’d be 
standing before you all to stand up for life. 
Janet Mills broke her campaign promise with her attempt to expand abortion up to any point ina 
woman’s pregnancy, citing the unfortunate story of baby Cameron, who had a lethal form of 
skeletal dysplasia. 
Cameron’s parents chose to end his suffering by having a late term abortion, for which Maine law 
already grants medical exception for. 
But I ﬁnd myself wondering, how do We judge whose suffering is worthy of a death sentence? 
Does one not think about the suffering a baby goes through during an abortion procedure, when 
it’s limbs are torn from its body? 
Allow me to quote the words of Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood director who 
witnessed an ultrasound-guided abortion: 
“When I looked on the screen, I saw a baby. I saw the probe going into the woman’s uterus, and 
then at that moment, I saw the baby moving, and trying to get away from the probe. AndI 
thought, it’s ﬁghting for its life. 
Its life. 
It’s alive. 
And then all of a sudden it was just over, like in the blink of an eye, and I saw the baby just 
crumble, and I was thinking, there was life in here, and now there’s not.” 
Ending suffering can look like compassion, but I stand here to Wain humanity of the slippery 
slope we are on. 
Whose suffering is worthy of a death sentence?~ 
An unwanted full tenn baby‘? An elderly person in a nursing home? Someone with a mental 
illness? 
The decisions you make today set legal precedent, I ask each of you, please choose wisely. 
Thank you.
