Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Judi Freeman, and I’m a resident of Litchﬁeld. I’m here to testify in opposition to 
LD 1 6 1 9. 
The majority of Mainers, our nation, or I, DO NOT support such a bill. Ultrasound technicians 
can testify that they visually see the unborn infant clearly reacts to pain. Abortion is to be rare 
and yet some people keep pushing for more extreme laws. Maine is close enough to neighboring 
states that have already chosen that path. Please leave things alone. They law is bad enough as it 
stands! 
Please vote ought not to pass.
