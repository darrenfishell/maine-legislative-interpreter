LD 1343
LD1343 must be opposed. It is your moral obligation under Godâ€™s Authority. I rebuke
this perverse and depraved bill and call upon all legislators to fear God and obey His 
commands, rejecting this depraved bill.
Revelation 14:6-7
6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to 
preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and 
tongue, and people,
7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his 
judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the 
fountains of waters.
Revelation 6:15-17
15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief 
captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid 
themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him 
that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
