Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, 
Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
My name is Elizabeth Oulton and I am a resident of Windham, Maine. 
I am here to oppose LD 1619. 
Repent, and hear what I have to say: 
Do not do this. 
Do not pass this bill, in the name of Jesus. 
There is so much at stake here. 
If this bill passes, all of those unborn babies will go to heaven. 
But where will you go? 
Have you considered eternity? 
Have you considered the weight of such a decision- as to pass this bill- on a human 
soul? 
The weight on a mother's heart? 
We were created for Love. 
God is Love. 
Don’t pass this bill. 
God loves you so much. 
Every ear hearing this: He loves you so much. 
That’s why He sent His Son, Jesus. 
One Child already died for the weight of the sins of the world. 
Why do you desire to kill another? 
Why do you desire this? 
Look at your heart. 
ls it beating for good? For righteousness? For love? 
lt is then beating for the things of God. 
ls this bill your own desire? 
Selfish? Evil? Malicious? Putrid? 
Your heart is dead: Working with the ways of Satan. 
Consider the lives at stake. 
Not just the babies’ , but your very own. 
Turn from your putrid wickedness and follow Jesus. 
He loves you. 
Obey Him. 
Choose today whom you will sen/e: Jesus, the Light of the world, or Satan, the one who 
comes to steal, kill and destroy. (John 10:10) 
Your very lives are at stake. 
Be careful.
