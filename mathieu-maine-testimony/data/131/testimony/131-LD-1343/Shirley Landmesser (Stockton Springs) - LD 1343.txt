Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee:
My Name is Shirley Landmesser and I live in Stockton Springs, Maine. I had an 
abortion June 8th, 1973 and graduated from high school a few days later.  I am not 
proud of my actions. At that time, I was swept up into the prevailing ideas that I had a
right to do whatever I wanted with my body. I wanted to travel. Explore the world. I 
figured that if it was legal, it was okay. When Planned Parenthood called to say that 
my pregnancy test was positive, they only asked if I wanted to terminate with no offer
of counseling or support. It was easy to overlook the fact that there was another body 
growing inside my body that also had a right; the right to live, breathe, and be the 
very unique being that he or she was created to be. My seven grandchildren are such 
individuals. Each one offers a perspective, a personality, a potential for so much good 
in the world. I know life isn’t perfect and sometimes hard choices have to be made, 
but please don’t promote abortion or make it easy.
