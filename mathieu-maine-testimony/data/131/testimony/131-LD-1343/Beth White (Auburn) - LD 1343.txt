Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Committee on Judiciary. My name is Beth White, I’m a resident of Auburn, and I urge you to please vote ought to pass on LD 1619 and LD 1343. These bills that are critical to safeguarding abortion access in Maine. As someone who was born with a uterus, and who is of reproductive age, I critically value reproductive rights and freedoms. I want you to know that I care deeply about abortion access in Maine and I believe private medical decisions should be made by patients and their doctors. I also believe all Mainers, no matter where in the state they live, deserve the right to access abortion care.The fact that my mother had more rights over her own body at my age, than I currently do after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, is absolutely maddening. America is supposed to be the “country of the free” - but I’m supposed to be expected to carry an unwanted child simply because some people in power want me to? The same people who shout about “personal freedom” and yell “don’t tread on me”? How can they explain that hypocrisy?Medical decisions should remain between a person and their medical professionals - no one else. No legislators, no politicians, no government ofﬁcials. Abortion is a medical decision. It’s one that a person with a uterus should make and no one else should interfere. Access to abortion services is about medical freedom. It's about the freedom for a person to decide what's best for them and THEIR family. I know that many legislators are strong supporters of personal freedoms and keeping government out of peoples' lives - allowing the government to restrict abortion access is the exact opposite of that. People and families deserve to make their own reproductive decisions with no input outside of themselves, their families, and their doctors. Please vote ought to pass on LD 1619 and LD 1343, and oppose any efforts to restrict access to abortion services in the future.
