Good morning, 
Madam & Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Alicia Collins. I am a resident and a selectman in the town of Sidney. 
I am speaking to y'ou today from the perspective of a post-abortive woman, who at the 
age of twenty (20) decided out of convenience and fear to end my ﬁrst and only 
pregnancy., 
You see, the moming of July. 15”‘ , 199*), I can boldly say I was Pro-choice, and by that 
afternoon I was Pro-life. 
I will not describe the circumstances of my heart change to you - I will say the “clump of 
cells” removed from me - was a complete and living body. Skin, ﬁngers, toes, and eyes. 
Proverbs 24:11-12, “Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced to die; save them as they 
stagger to their death. Don’t excuse yourself by saying, ‘Look, we didn’t know.’ For God 
understands all hearts, and he sees you. He who guards your soul knows you knew. He 
will repay all people as their actions deserve. ” 
I don’t curse you. /I implore you. Take heed! 
I cannot undo the life changing decision from that morning. I can only stand as a witness 
to my own experience. I stand in the gap between life and death. I act as a beacon and 
Warn those Willing to listen to go back — CHOOSE LIFE. A 
Members of this committee, you have a great privilege, and responsibility, to uphold 
LIFE.' 
Do NOT support this bill. 
Do NOT support Planned Parenthood ’s culture of death. 
God’s wrath is real, and your very soul is at stake. 
The emotional scars I have carried will be the scars the committee members will carry, 
and the scars the legislatures will carry should this bill pass. 
People are praying for each member of this committee to OPPOSE LD 1619 and to 
CHOOSE LIFE. , 
Thank-you, 
Alicia Collins
