Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Distinguished Members of the Joint Committee  
on the J udiciary : 
 
My name is Anne Gass and I’m writing  in support of LD 1343 - An Act to Protect the 
Reproductive Freedom of Maine People by Preempting the Field of Abortion Regulation.  
 It is unconscionable that women ’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness should be in 
any way abridged by legislation forcing them  to bear children. This is a choice a woman alone 
should make, in consultation with her medical advisers .  
 LD 1343 would ensure that extrem ists could not enact legislation that would pro hibit women 
from acce ssing the reproductive health ca re the y need .  
 
I would add, however, that LD 1343 should be amended to explicitly include contraception , 
since extremists  also assert that some forms of contraception  are “abortifacients .” 
 
I urg e you to protect women’s right to choose whether and when to become mothers.
