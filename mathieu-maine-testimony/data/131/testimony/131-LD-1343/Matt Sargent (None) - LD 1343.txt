I am here today because my parents chose life for me. They had every excuse to do otherwise: they were both 
recovering alcoholics, my dad was disabled so they were dependent on welfare, and they each had previous 
marriages and families that were absolute train wrecks. They had no intention of ever bringing another child into 
this world, but when my mother discovered she was pregnant she chose to see it as a blessing from God. My wife 
was born prematurely at 25 weeks weighing just 2 lbs. 2 oz. The doctors told her folks that she would be mentally 
challenged, unable to walk properly or even bear children. And yet today we are the proud parents of six healthy, 
beautiful children of our own and if God so chooses to bless us with another we will welcome him or her with 
open arms regardless of their physical or mental capacity. lâ€˜m sure many of you have already made up your minds 
how you plan to vote on these bills. Please know that as our elected representatives you have a monumental 
responsibility to prescribe either good or evil for our state's citizens and that the God of heaven, the creator and 
judge of all will hold you to account for your decisions in these halls.
