Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Gabrielle Carbonneau and I am a resident of Pittsfield. I 
am here to testify in opposition to LD I619. 
I am a registered nurse, a mother and grandmother and someone who has compassion for 
women who have been effected by abortion. As an RN, I've had the privilege of working in the 
newborn nursery at a hospital in central Maine. I was the one who “caught” the baby once 
delivered. I had the unique perspective of being the ﬁrst to meet this little person. I assessed 
each infant from head to toe. What a an honor and what weight that carried with it! 
I caught newborns as young as 30 weeks in gestation and as old as 44 weeks. I've also 
attended deliveries of stillborn infants. I can assure you that these are indeed, human beings- 
precious in the eyes of God. 
Abortion at any time for any reason, right up to birth is not only extreme, but it is illogical. 
The pregnant woman will still deliver her child. All that changes is that she is delivering a 
dead child. Having cared for pregnant women who have lost their child in utero and helping 
her deliver her stillborn child is haunting for caregivers and decimating for the mother. 
This grief pales in comparison to the grief a woman who has had an abortion will experience. 
The loss is compounded by the weight of having chosen to kill her child inside her womb. 
There is no logical explanation for this either, as she will still labor and deliver her child, albeit 
a deceased child., 
Please hear us today. Mainers do not want this extreme and dangerous legislation. If passed, 
LD 1619 would make Maine one of only six states in the nation with such an extreme law. 
Maine can instead, lead the way. Please vote against LD I619. Thank you for this opportunity 
to be heard.‘
