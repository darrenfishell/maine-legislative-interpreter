I unequivocally oppose abortion. It is the taking of a defenseless human life. 
 I do believe in freedom of choice - a woman can choose to have sex or not - to 
become pregnant or not.  Once she is pregnant it is too late for a choice.
With all the different people demanding their rights, we must protect the rights of the 
unborn child, who has no voice but ours.
As a society our focus and priority should be the protection of our children.
Reproductive freedom should be the freedom to choose whether to conceive or not. It 
should not include the killing of a child after conception.
