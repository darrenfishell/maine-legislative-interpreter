Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, 
I am John Janelle. I live in Auburn, Maine. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619, “An act to 
improve Maine’s reproductive privacy laws," which is sponsored by Rep. Talbot Ross. 
This bill that allows the taking of a baby's life that can survive outside 
the womb at any time for any reason will make Maine’s abortion laws among the 
most extreme in the nation. This bill is in opposition to the law of God and is 
immoral bringing pain, suffering, and death. Please do not allow legislation for the 
killing of the unborn at anytime for any reason. All of us were once in the womb 
and were given a chance to live. They were created to have life as we have life. 
This bill is not good for the people of Maine. Thank you for your time today. 
Please join me by voting ought not to pass on LD 1619. 
John Janelle 
393 Center St. Apt 46
