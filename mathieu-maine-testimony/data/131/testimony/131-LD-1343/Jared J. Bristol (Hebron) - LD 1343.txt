Dear Chairs Sen. Anne Carney and Rep. Matt Moonen and All Judiciary Committee Members: 
I have a brief opportunity here to share with you some thoughts on your upcoming vote on LD 
1619. 
If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you were not aborted. Just think about that fora 
moment, please. You are a lucky one. You’ve had your shot at life. If you intend to pass this bill, 
you’re absolutely blowing that gift. Your mother did not kill you. Congrats. But you seem hell-bent 
(and hell-bound) to pass a law that will result in the murder of unknown thousands of children who will 
not get that shot. Key word there is “hell” . Doctors? Nurses? Teachers? First responders? Artists? 
Athletes? Lawyers? Actually moral lawyers? Good ole boys and girls? Incredibly loving Down’s 
Syndrome babies‘? We’ll never know them in this life. 
I do not really know what to say to make you see what you are doing. I pray to God that He 
will change your heart and may He forgive you. Please...vote "Ought NOT to Pass" on LD 1619, and 
every other of these vile abortion bills you will be considering. This will not be forgotten. 
Sincerely, 
Jared J. Bristol
