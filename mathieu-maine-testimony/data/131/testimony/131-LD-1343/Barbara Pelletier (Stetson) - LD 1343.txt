Madam/Mister Chair & Honor Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Barbara Pelletier and I am a resident of Stetson. I am here to testify in opposition to 
LD 1619. (An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws) 
If this bill passes the impact on our state will be relaying a message of; 
1. Allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. What is the difference ofa 
parent abusing or killing their child at home? There is no difference, except the parent who kills 
at home goes to prison. Could this change the court decisions on child murder cases at home? 
2. Maine will be recognized of having one of the most extreme abortion laws in the United States. 
This will show the entire country; “Welcome to Maine, a state that has no regards for Human 
Life.” 
How about the impact on the birthing mother. Being pregnant for up to 9 months confused, pressured in 
aborting for many diﬁerent reasons. Will she have follow up care with a counselor? Sometimes Bills 
are written and passed and no one cares for the mother after the abortion. 
If LD 1619 passes the impact on and many Mainers, shows that our State of Maine Government has no 
regards for Humanity. To have a bill to expand abortion up to birth is unnecessary and it does not 
Improve Maine's Reproductive Law, it just makes it easier to kill a baby up to 9 months old. 
Please do not pass LD 1619 
Thank-you 
Barbara Pelletier
