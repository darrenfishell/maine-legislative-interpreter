LD 1619 Testimony 5/1/2023 
My name is Noah Curtis and l'm a resident of Pembroke. l will begin my brief testimony with a quote 
that we are all familiar with. ”We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal and 
are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness ” The very founding documents of our country acknowledge the truth that we 
are created in the image of God, and that we have the right to life. Yourjob as our lawmakers is to make 
laws that will punish evil and reward those who do good. After l read this bill, the only way I can 
describe it is just plain evil. You are accountable to us, the people, and we are here telling you we don't 
want this radical promotion of evil in our state. But ultimately you will have to answer to God in the end, 
and He will hold you accountable for whether you choose to do good or to do evil. l ask you to, andI 
quote from our constitution, ”secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity" and vote 
against LD 1619 and protect life. Thank you
