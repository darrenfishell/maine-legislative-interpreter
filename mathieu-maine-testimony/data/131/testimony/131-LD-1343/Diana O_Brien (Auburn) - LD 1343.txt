Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable 
Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
My name is Diana O’Brien, l am a resident of Auburn and 
blessed to have 4 grown children and 8 grandchildren 
who also live in the State of Maine. 
Today, l am testifying in opposition to LD1619 that allows 
late term abortions. Abortion was legalized in 1973 
through Roe V. Wade, so women could be safe having an 
abortion. Late term abortions seen as overkill. This is 
when the baby is viable and can live outside the womb. 
Through an ultrasound the baby is seen sucking their 
fingers, playing with their toes, and they can also be seen 
feeling pain if poked. Current laws allow for medical 
necessity in cases of still born, ectopic pregnancy, etc. 
Today in 2023 we have many ways to prevent and stop 
pregnancy prior to 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, 
why is it necessary to have LD1619 here in Maine’? 
We live in a time where all lives matter. lt’s time that we 
stand up for the smallest Mainer’s life. They are the future 
of Maine, please give them a chance to live by stopping 
LD1619. Thank You."
