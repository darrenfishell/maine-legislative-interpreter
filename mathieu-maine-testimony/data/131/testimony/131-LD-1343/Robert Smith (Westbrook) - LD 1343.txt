I am in opposition to LD 1343.
It is highly inappropriate to use a sledge hammer to all abortion  regulation in the 
State of Maine.  What is there being proposed to replace the regulations already on 
the books?  Or is it the intent of the sponsor(s) to make Maine an unregulated state 
lacking in any safeguards for anyone and removing all licensing and regulation on 
reproductive procedures,  practitioners and patients.  Maine would become the Wild 
West of reproductive care.  How many Mainers would die as a result of this 
legislation?  Bad bill. Vote No.
