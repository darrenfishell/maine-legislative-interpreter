Melissa Coppa
Plymouth
LD 1343
My name is Melissa Coppa from Plymouth and I write to you today opposing 
LD1619 as well as LD 776, and LD 1343. I speak to you today on behalf of my child 
whom I aborted over 21 years ago. My child was wanted and valued by me but not by
my partner. It was shortly after 911, the world was one of instability and uncertainty. 
My partner had all the reasons why it wasn’t the right time to have another baby as it 
would have been our second. After our conversation and seeing the look on his face I 
knew I would never get to hold my precious baby. I made an appointment to appease 
him and “conveniently” missed it because it was not what I wanted to do. He was not 
very happy and told me to make another appointment. In the process of doing so I 
found out I was too far along in my pregnancy to have an abortion in the state I lived 
in. This gave me a small glimmer of hope. This hope quickly faded as I found out that
the state next door did allow and perform these abortions and so we went and I had 
the abortion. The regret was instantaneous, and it has traveled with me throughout my
entire life. This bill would make it legal for anyone from anywhere to come and have 
an abortion here in Maine. That means women in my situation at anytime in 
pregnancy could be forced to come here and forced to have an abortion.    The life of 
the child would end and the life of the mother would forever be changed. Battling 
abortion regret is real, the sadness, depression, loss, anger, all of the stages of grief 
are present and compounded by the truth that you yourself took the life of your own 
child. This is something I will live with for the rest of my life. Please don’t help make
my reality be that of many others, please choose better for our beautiful state, please 
choose life for the future children of Maine and of our country, please do what is 
moral and ethical and vote ought not to pass LD1619, LD776 and LD1343.
