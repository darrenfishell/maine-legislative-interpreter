Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Brenda Mathieu and I ama 
resident of Westbrook. I am a mother, a grandmother, and a great grandmother. I 
am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
If a person were to retell the recent history of abortion as a historical event and 
substituted the over 65 million deaths to a plague or an atrocity of a dictator, I 
believe one would be so moved by the sheer number of deaths. However, here 
weâ€™re talking about a decision of a human being, exerting power over an innocent 
victim, and being extinguished just like a flame...gone! 
The elimination of children is nothing new! They have always been an easy mark. 
So I ask all of you to truly hear my words. In today's reality, Abortion is here to 
stay, whether we approve it or not. And with current laws in place in Maine for 
when medical necessity is needed, I plead with you to think about the power in 
your hands and vote NO on LD 1619. 
Let us not expand abortion rights to the unthinkable, a viable life. 
Thank you for representing our great State of Maine. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Brenda J. Mathieu
