Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary:g 
My name is Robert Kane and l live in Standish. l speak as a Mainer, and as a young man invested ina 
future that can benefit us all, in the state of Maine and in this country, but especially for the future of 
those babies (soon to be children) whose lives will go tragically unrealized. I'd like to think many of those 
children will become irreplaceable artisans who build, engineers who design, lawyers who bring justice, 
doctors who heal, and the list goes on.t
, 
However, l know as a fact that this bill is beyond common abortion. This bill is extensively extreme. 
Aborting a child past 24 weeks, past viability, is reckless and barbaric. And many Americans who 
disagree with me on the abortion issue, stand with me when viable babies are on the table. According to 
a 2022 sun/ey by the Pew Research Center, Americans are twice as likely to say that abortion after 
viability should be illegal than legal, with only 22% saying it should be legal, 43% saying it should be 
illegal, and 18% saying it depends. 43% is a number to be properly considered. _ 
In addition, this bill removes penalties for non-licensed individuals who practice abortion procedures. This 
removes protections for vulnerable women, likely exposing them to untrained, dangerous practice. 
This bill steps beyond its claim to simply protect the right to privacy when it supports aborting viable 
babies and removes penalties for the unlicensed. So l speak against this bill as an appeal to 
bipartisanship for common sense, public safety and public goodwill. 
Lastly, thank you for this opportunity to speak my conscience. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
