My name is Ashley. I am from Lewiston and I oppose LD1619. 
Due to medical problems, I am unable to have children of my own. In 2012, my husband and I became 
foster parents. In a span of 11 years, we were able to love on 9 children and adopt 3 of them. 
The story I am sharing today is actually my 10 year old daughter ’s birth story. Her birth mom utilized the 
Safe Haven law. In Maine, This law allows for a birth parent to voluntarily and confidently surrender a 
child 31 days or younger to a number of safe haven providers such as police, hospital, fire department 
etc. The child is then placed into DHHS care and adopted by a family like mine. 
My daughter was born healthy at a hospital. Her birth mom said the words Safe Haven and was able to 
leave her at the hospital with no questions asked. 
I was at my daughter's side when she was 16 hours old and we were able to begin the adoption process 
as soon as a 6 month waiting period completed. 
There are versions of this Safe Haven law in every state. I believe more pregnant women should be told 
of this as an option. I regularly thank God that my daughter ’s birth Mom chose life. I am so very blessed 
to be her Mom and I can only imagine that if late term abortions were legal, that may not be the case.
