TO THE JUDICIARY COlVll\/llTl'EE; 
My name is Catherine Harrington and l have lived in l\/laine all my life. I am a mom 
of 3 and a grandmother of 14. l am here in opposition to LD1619. 
When my boys were growing into young adults, we had the abortion talk. I told 
them that if they got a they girl pregnant, they would not have any say in if she 
had the baby or aborted it. Now we are faced with the fact that this girl could 
now decide to abort the baby just before she was due to give birth. 
This baby could be killed before it had a chance to take it's first breath. l cannot 
imagine this happening, yet here we are. 
Who would this baby be if left to be born and grow up? Are we saying it's ok to 
kill this baby for convenience? Abortion is legal up to viability already, why do we 
need to make it ok up until birth? This is a baby that would be born and grow up 
to be someone special. What right do we have to sacrifice this child? It's not 
necessary, nor is it right. Please don't sentence these innocent and helpless 
babies to death. When you vote, it's in your power. Please use your vote wisely. 
lâ€™m begging you for those that don't have a voice yet.
