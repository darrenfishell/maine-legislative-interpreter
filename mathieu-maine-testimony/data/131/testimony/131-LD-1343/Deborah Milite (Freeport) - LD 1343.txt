Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonan and Honorable 
l\/leinbers of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Deborah l\/lilite and l live in Freeport. l am 
testilying today in opposition ofLD 1619, An Act to improve 
‘Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws. 
Bath, Maine, l9l9, Doris, '18, unmarried, rnotherless at 
15, living in West Bath with sister’s family, employed at Texas 
Steamship Company, amidst a relationship with a co»-worker, 
becomes pregnant. 
Maine law allows unrestricted abortion until 24 weeks, and 
after ifneeessary for the mother’s health. Now, Governor Mills 
seeks to change current law to unrestricted abortion through 
birth, with the mother’s rights the sole determinant of her hahy’s 
life. 
I oppose expanding l\/ilaine abortion law through birth. A 
fetus is dependent upon, BUT is a genetieally distinguished and 
separate being from, its mother, developing to become viable. 
When does abortion heeorne infanticide ‘? The S/rorter" Oag/bra’ 
English Diclioirczijv, l973, shows “infant” as deriving from the 
Latin, “in fa/'1' , ” “unable to speak.” Who is charged with 
protecting the “unable to speak”? The State has a charge in this. 
What does it say about Mainers that expanding abortion through 
birth would align us with North Korea, China, Vietnam‘? ls this 
really what our citizens demand? i think not. 
Doris, pregnant in 1919, married her co-worker, my 
grandfather, and gave birth in l92() to my uncle, then my dad, 
who engendered me 32 years later. I am grateful to my 
grandparents for choosing life, a precious gift. I urge the 
Committee to oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, and vote, 
“ought not to pass.” Thank you.
