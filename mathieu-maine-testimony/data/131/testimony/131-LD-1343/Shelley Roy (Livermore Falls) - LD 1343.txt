Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, 
My name is Shelley Roy, and l am a resident of Livermore Falls. I'm here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
Children are image bearers of an Almighty God and each is created with a purpose that He has designed 
for their young life. It is God who numbers our days and each one of them is written in His book. 
Location does not determine the viability of a human. A child in the womb is just as much of a person as 
each one of us is here in this room today. It is against God's law to take a human life whether in the 
womb or outside of it. 
My husband and l would gladly adopt a baby of a mother who is unable to care for her child, and there 
are many more couples willing to do the same. There are other choices, other options, and 
communities of people who will stand beside a woman who finds herself unable to care for her 
child. There is hope in Christ and my prayer is that He will change hearts and open eyes to His Truth for 
LIFE. 
l urge you to vote ought not to pass and save the lives of the unborn in Maine. 
Thank you for your time. 
Shelley Roy
