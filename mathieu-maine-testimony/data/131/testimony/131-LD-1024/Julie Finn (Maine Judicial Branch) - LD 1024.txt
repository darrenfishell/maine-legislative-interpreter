Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 1024, Resolve, to Study 
the Impact of Divorce, Child Support Issues and Custody Issues on Children, 
Parents, Health, Poverty and Housing Insecurity:
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
some brief testimony regarding this bill. 
Many District Court judges and staff members of the Judicial Branch are directly 
involved in the issues listed in this resolve. We would thus respectfully request that the bill be 
amended to include as nonvoting, or advisory, members of the Commission, two appointees from 
the Judicial Branch to be appointed by the Chief Justice.
Thank you for your time.
