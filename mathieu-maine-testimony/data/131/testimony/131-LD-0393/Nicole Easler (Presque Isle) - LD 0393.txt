Testimony in Support of LD # 393 Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of 
Portions of Chapter 33: Rules Governing Physical Restraint and Seclusion, a 
Major Substantive Rule of the Department of Education 
My name is Nicole Easler and I live in Presque Isle. I am a self-advocate meaning I am 
a person who lives with a disability. I am a member of SUFU.   
 
This bill is important to me because I was often restrained in school as a child. It was 
often used as a punishment or to get children to comply. It did not help. Staff were often 
not properly restraining children. I was often injured and I have permanent injuries that 
have not healed properly from being restrained.  
 
I feel that a school is no place for force and restraint and that other methods should be 
used that are more appropriate for behavior management. Restraint should never be 
used as a form of punishment or control. And in my experience, that's what it was often 
used for. So, I would like to see this end.  
 
I support this bill because I don't want children to go through what I went through.  This 
bill will help me because I will know that if it gets passed, children in school and young 
people are not going through the things that I and other self-advocates I know have 
gone through. This will help others, and it'll be a relief knowing that other students in 
schools will be safe.  
 
School should be a safe place for all students and staff. Appropriate behavior 
management strategies should be used that don't involve physical force.  
 
I will be available to answer questions by phone or by e-mail. 
 
I ask you to vote in favor of LD 393. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,
