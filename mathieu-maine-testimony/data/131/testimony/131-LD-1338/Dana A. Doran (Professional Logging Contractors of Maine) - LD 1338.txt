Testimony of 
DANA A. DORAN 
Executive Director 
Professional Logging Contractors of Maine 
Before the Committee on Taxation in Opposition to LD 1338 — An Act To Amend 
the Maine Exclusion Amount in the Estate Tax 
Thursday, May 17, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation, my name is Dana Doran, and I am the Executive Director of the Professional Logging 
Contractors of Maine The Professional Logging Contractors of Maine (PLC) is the voice of 
logging and associated trucking contractors throughout the state of Maine The PLC was formed 
in 1995 to represent independent contractors in a rapidly changing forest industry 
As of 2021, logging and trucking contractors in Maine employed over 3,000 people directly and 
were indirectly responsible for the creation of an additional 2,500 ]0l)S This employment and 
the investments that contractors make contributed $582 million to the state’s economy Our 
membership, which includes 200 contractor members and an additional 120 associate 
members, employs more than 75% of the individuals who work in this industry and is also 
responsible for 80% of Maine’s annual timber harvest 
Thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify on behalf of our membership in 
opposition to Opposition to LD 1338 — An Act To Amend the Maine Exclusion Amount in the 
Estate Tax We certainly understand and respect the intent of the sponsor, but we can’t support 
using changes in the estate tax to do that 
The logging industry in Maine was in the midst of a reinvention process until the onset of 
COVID 19 and the digestor explosion at the Jay mill in April 2020 As a result of mill closures, 
curtailments and inﬂation created by the response to COVID 19, we are estimating that Maine 
has lost 30% of its harvesting capacity and the layoff of nearly 1,000 people in harvesting and 
hauling since 2020 In _]1lSlI four years, the industry has shrunk from an annual economic impact 
of $620 million to $582 million and total ]0l)S have been reduced from 9,000 to 5,500 Put 
simply, logging and trucking contractors across the state are ﬁghting for the lives and state 
policy changes that reduce expenditures and provide efﬁciencies are those that we are 
completely in favor of 
LD 1338 is not a pro-small business bill, and it certainly will not help these businesses ﬁght 
through this challenging time nor will it help retain _]Ol)S in rural Maine In fact, it Wlll only 
continue to erode small businesses, put further pressure upon rural areas of the state and add 
the potential for costly litigation which will inevitably lead to business death by a thousand cuts
For context, on June 15, 2021 and also on June 6, 2019, th1s Commu-tee voted on party l1nes to 
enact LD 1524 (13oth Leglslature) and LD 420 (129*h Legxslature), An Act to Amend the Mame 
Excluslon Amount m the Estate Tax Both of those blllS met a s1m1lar fate on thefloor of the House 
and Senate and d1ed a qulet death, pun mtended 
The b1lls from the 129* and 130* Leglslature were 1dent1cal 1n that they would have returned the 
estate tax excluslon amount to $2 m1ll1on from $5 7 m1ll1on for estates of decedents dylng on or 
after January 1, 2020 and would have removed the annual adjustment for 1nﬂat1on of that 
excluslon amount And yes, th1sleg1slat1on, s1m1lar to LD 1524 1n 2021, would make an exceptlon 
for natural resource busmesses such as farmmg, ﬁshmg and umber harvestmg However, th1s 
wasn’t a C01‘lC6SS10I1 that we wanted, asked for, nor agreed to and, 1n the end, 1t would st1ll lower 
the threshold to $3 8 m1ll1on from $5 m1ll1on It also wouldn’t extend to all of the other 
components of tlmber harvestmg buslnesses such as other real property, mcludmg but not l1m1ted 
to real estate, truckmg, etc As a result, we st1ll cannot support th1s leglslatlon 
Th1s b1ll would place an undue burden on mlddle class fam1l1es and small busmess owners such 
as our membershlp It 1s essentlally a m1dd1e-class tax upon our hard-workmg members 
Ma1ne’s estate tax applles to everythmg a person owns at the tlme of h1s or her death lncludmg 
that person’s home, other real estate, bank account balances, l1fe msurance proceeds, annu1t1es 
and other mvestments, IRAs and other pre-tax retlrement savmgs, and tanglble personal property 
such as Jewelry, vehlcles, and household ltems The comb1ned value of these assets adds up 
qulckly 
Our membershlp does not have substantlal savmgs, so when the estate of a small busmess owner 
1s not able to pay an estate tax l1ab1l1ty, the famlly must elther sell the busmess or secure a loan to 
fund the payment Removlng assets from the estate 1s the only way to avold th1s estate tax, domg 
so 1s not an optlon for many who have thelr assets tled up 1n current operatlons Furthermore, the 
fees to hlre an estate planmng lawyer to remove assets from the estate often can run lnto tens of 
thousands of dollars 
Thank you for provldmg me wlth the opportumty to appear before you today to testlfy In 
opposltlon to th1s blll and I would be happy to answer any questlons you may have now or 
durmg the work sesslon
