 TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Hearing Date: May 17, 2023 
  
LD 1338 – “An Act to Amend the Maine Exclusion Amount in the Estate Tax” 
 
 
 Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee – good morning, my name is Michael Allen, Associate Commissioner 
for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  I am 
testifying at the request of the Administration Against LD 1338, “An Act to Amend 
the Maine Exclusion Amount in the Estate Tax.” 
This bill increases the Maine estate tax by reducing the Maine estate tax 
exclusion amount, creates an additional special exclusion amount for certain 
estates, and provides that the increased estate tax revenue be transferred to the 
Maine State Housing Authority to support affordable housing.  This bill creates 
unnecessary complexity to the Maine estate tax return. In addition, while States 
have varied over time in the degree of difference between the respective state and 
federal exclusion amounts, Maine would be the first state that we are aware of to 
reduce the state-level estate tax exclusion amount since the repeal of the federal 
State Death Tax Credit in 2001. Table A, attached, attached to this testimony, lists 
the federal and Maine exclusion amounts for the years 2011 through 2023. 
The bill before you is complex.  For decedents dying on or after January 1, 
2024, the bill reduces the Maine estate tax exclusion amount (“Maine exclusion 
amount”) from $5,600,000 to $2,000,000 and creates an additional exclusion 
amount, up to $3,800,000, for family farms and aquaculture, fishing, and wood 
2 
 harvesting businesses.  The additional exclusion applies to farmland or depreciable 
machinery and equipment used in commercial agricultural production, commercial 
aquacultural production, commercial fishing, or commercial wood harvesting that 
is inherited by a family member and remains in commercial use for 5 years 
following transfer.  Beginning in 2025, the $2,000,000 exclusion amount and the 
$3,800,000 additional exclusion amount are annually adjusted for inflation, for 
estates of decedents who die in the succeeding calendar year.  The additional 
exclusion amount is subject to recapture if the underlying property fails to meet 
eligibility requirements at any time during the five-year period. 
Beginning January 1, 2024, the revenue generated by the reduction in the 
Maine exclusion amount in 36 M.R.S. § 4102, sub-§ 5, ¶ D must be transferred 
monthly to the Maine State Housing Authority to be used to support housing, 
twenty-five percent of which must be used to support affordable housing for 
veterans.   
Only estates worth more than the Maine exclusion amount are subject to the 
Maine estate tax.  The current Maine estate tax exclusion is $5,600,000, which 
adjusted for inflation is $6,410,000 for 2023 decedents.    There are three Maine 
estate tax rates applicable to the Maine taxable estate exceeding the Maine 
exclusion amount (8%, 10%, and 12%).  Currently, the federal exclusion amount is 
$12,920,000.   
Maine conforms to the special federal treatment of property used in farming 
or other trades or businesses.  Internal Revenue Code, Section 2032A allows 
special valuation of qualified use property.  To qualify for the special federal 
treatment, the property must be used “primarily” in farming or other business 
activity for 5 of 8 years preceding the death of the decedent and, to avoid 
recapture, 10 years following the death of the decedent.  Also, for federal purposes, 
3 
 at least 50% of a decedent’s estate must consist of real/personal property used in 
farming or other trade or business. 
The Administration notes that the bill significantly increases the complexity 
and the number of taxpayers subject to the Maine estate tax, increases the reporting 
requirements for taxpayers and tax preparers, and increases MRS staff processing 
and auditing activity.  At the same time, this proposal is much more generous than 
the special federal treatment of property used in farming or other trade or business.  
Due to the broader scope of this proposal, many more estates will qualify for the 
additional Maine estate tax exclusion for farmland or depreciable property and 
equipment than would qualify for the federal estate tax benefits.  In addition, as the 
bill is written, qualifying estates may be eligible for both the special valuation 
treatment under the Internal Revenue Code, Section 2032A and the increased 
Maine exclusion amount with respect to the same property. 
There are numerous other technical comments on the bill that can be 
provided if the Committee decides to move forward with the bill.    
The estimated revenue impact of the bill is a tax increase of approximately 
$17 million per year.  
The estimated administrative costs continue to be under consideration.  As 
written, the bill may result in additional staffing requirements to process and audit 
affected tax returns. 
The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.
