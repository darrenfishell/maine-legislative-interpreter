LD 894, An Act to Preserve Heating and Ener gy Choice by Prohibiting a Municipality from
Prohibiting a Particular Ener gy System or Ener gy Distributor
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on State
and Local Government, my name is Naomi Albert, and I am Project Manager for A Climate to
Thrive. I am testifying in opposition to LD 894, An Act to Preserve Heating and Ener gy Choice
by Prohibiting a Municipality from Prohibiting a Particular Ener gy System or Ener gy Distributor .
LD 894 would narrow the home rule authority of Maine municipalities, expanding state control
over municipal decision-making. Municipalities are best equipped to determine which ener gy
policies fit their communities and should retain this authority . If enacted, LD 894 could trigger
costly litigation for a broad array of local ener gy policies that could be interpreted as having “the
effect of prohibiting” an entity from installing a heating or ener gy system. This broad language is
problematic and could prevent municipalities from adopting a range of ener gy policies out of
fear of litigation. Furthermore, this legislation sets a negative precedent for state overreach into
municipal ener gy policy .
LD 894 prevents municipalities from protecting the health of their residents. Combustion of
fuels, including heating oil, natural gas, kerosene, and propane, produce harmful air pollutants
such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and formaldehyde.

Household air
pollution contributes to premature death and increased risk from ischemic heart disease, stroke,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer , type 2 diabetes, and lower
respiratory infections and is associated with increased asthma risks.

Even natural gas used in
homes, a fuel often perceived as the “clean” option,  has been found to contain toxic volatile
organic chemicals linked to cancer .

Scientists have
long understood that the byproducts of
combustion are damaging for health, but recent research has shown that common residential
appliances, such as gas stoves, produce dangerous levels of air pollution.

attributable to pollution from gas stoves.

Meanwhile, asthma is a significant public health threat
in Maine, where asthma rates are significantly higher than the national average.
6
Not only are
these pollutants found in high levels indoors in homes that use combustion appliances, but they
are also released into the surrounding neighborhood. In a 2022 report based on an extensive
analysis of peer -reviewed literature, the American Lung Association concluded that indoor
combustion significantly contributes to outdoor ambient air pollution. While a building’ s heating
or ener gy system may be an individual choice, cumulatively , these individual systems
significantly impact the air quality of the entire community . The evidence shows that many
commercially available heating and ener gy systems may not be safe for public health. For this
reason, communities should have a choice in the type of heating and ener gy systems allowed in
new construction in their locality , as these systems will impact local air quality .
Furthermore, the alternatives to combustion heating and ener gy systems are af fordable and cost
effective. As heating oil, propane, and kerosene costs rise, municipalities should have the
authority to encourage cost-ef fective, clean heating and ener gy systems in new construction that
will best serve their residents (such as heat pumps and induction stoves) without fear of lawsuit.
In fact, Ef ficiency Maine Trust’s home heating cost comparison tool shows that with current fuel
prices, homes heated with heat pumps have significantly lower annual ener gy costs than those
heated with fuel oil, propane, or kerosene. Municipalities should have the authority to choose
cleaner , cost-ef fective, and more environmentally friendly systems that will best serve their
community’ s long-term goals.
This legislation is part of a troubling trend of state laws to preempt local control over ener gy
policy . There is evidence that “ener gy choice” legislation, introduced in other states, has been
heavily influenced by the American Gas Association and other fossil fuel interests.
7
While the
bill language is framed around preserving “choice,” its implementation will have the opposite
effect for municipal choice over ener gy policy in Maine. This legislation better serves fossil fuel
interests than the people of Maine.
Finally , LD 894 is not supportive of the state of Maine’ s climate action goals. Buildings account
for about one third of Maine’ s greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from fossil fuel combustion.
8
Transitioning from fossil fuel use in buildings will be essential in realizing the state’ s climate
goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. Yet, LD 894 severely limits the ability of municipalities to
reduce carbon emissions from buildings.
In closing, this legislation would preempt municipal choice and conflict with municipal and state
public health, climate action, and building ef ficiency goals. Prohibiting municipalities from
