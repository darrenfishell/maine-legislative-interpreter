RE: Testimony  in SUPPORT of LD 894, An Act to Preserve Heating and Energy Choice by 
Prohibiting a Municipality from Prohibiting a Particular Energy Sy stem or Energy Distributor  
Dear Senator Nangle , Representative Stover  and members of the Labor and Housing 
Committee:  
 
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO  of the Retail Association of Maine. I 
am a resident of Topsham.  We have more than 350  members statewide and represent retailers 
of all sizes. Maineâ€™s retailers employ more than 85 ,000 Mainers. We are here today to testify in 
support of LD 894 . 
 
We under stand the importance of conversations around how Mainers heat their homes and 
businesses , and the importance of the evolution of heati ng systems that get away from f ossil 
fuels. However, we are con cerned that certain muni cipalities would look  to regulat e or limit the 
types of heating systems that could be used  whether they be wood, oil, gas and electr icity.  
 
By law, local building code s must follow the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code, which 
permits regulation of heating and energy installations based on safety. LD 894 does not remove 
this authority.   
 
Thank you for consideration of our comments.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Curtis Picard, CAE ,  
President and CEO
