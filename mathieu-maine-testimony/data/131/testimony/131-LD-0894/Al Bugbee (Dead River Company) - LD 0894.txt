Dead Diver Company -— Delivering on A promise 
Testimony of: Al Bugbee March 16"‘ , 2023 
Dead River Company — Vice President of Operations 
Resident of Falmouth, ME 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government: LD 894 - An Act to Preserve 
Heating and Energy Choice by Prohibiting a Municipality from Prohibiting a Particular Energy 
System or Energy Distributor 
Position: Support 
I respectfully request the Committee support LD 894. 
l support LD 894 for the following reasons: 
1. With municipalities in other states enacting or attempting to restrict energy choices for homes 
and businesses, we must preserve the right for Maine citizens to choose their energy source. 
2. Energy costs are at an all~time high for Maine residents. Today, homeowners and businesses 
have sought to diversify their heating options to include choices like propane, solar panels, 
wood pellets, heat pumps, and natural gas. The use of multiple heat sources allows citizens to 
make smart choices based on cost, weather, and other factors. Maintaining this right to 
choose is essential to allowing Maine citizens their best chance to afford current and future 
energy costs. 
3. Preserving the right to choose will maintain a competitive environment in the energy market. 
This free-market system will help keep energy costs down for Maine citizens.
