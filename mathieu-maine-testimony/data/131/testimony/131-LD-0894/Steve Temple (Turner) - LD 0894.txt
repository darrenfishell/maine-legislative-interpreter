LD 894
To the members of the committee on state and local government. 
My name is Steve Temple I am the General Manager of Sail Energy DBA Murray Heutz Oil 
and Propane in Turner, ME We serve approximately 7000 customers in Oxford, 
Androscoggin, and Cumberland County.
I have been in the residential and commercial heating industry in this state for 23 years. In 
that time, I have seen the many different options Mainers have in fuel sources take their turns
at the bottom, and the top, of both supply and cost. Without the option to choose, Mainers 
could find themselves in a place financially, that they cannot recover from. Additionally, Maine
employs thousands of people in the energy industry to include hard working Mainers in oil, 
kerosene, propane, natural gas, wood, wood pellets, solar and electricity. That is a large 
segment of employees to consider when removing them from the workforce. Our neighbor the
state of NH was faced with and signed into law SB86. Just as it was important to them to put 
in a law to protect their choice, it is equally important to the Mainers that I have spoken with 
and served all these years. 
In that light I submit testimony in support of LD 894 and thank Senator Harrington for 
sponsoring such an important piece of legislation.
Respectfully,
Steve Temple,
Murray Heutz Oil and Propane
