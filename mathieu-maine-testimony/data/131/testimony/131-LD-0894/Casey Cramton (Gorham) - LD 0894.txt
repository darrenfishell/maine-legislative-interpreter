Resident of Gorham  
 
Before the Joint Standing  Committee on State and Local Government  
 
Concerning:  LD 894 – An Act to Preserve Heating and Energy  Choice by Prohibiting a 
Municipality from Prohibiting a Particular Energy System or Energy Distributor  
 
Position:  Suppo rt 
 
I respectfully request the Committee support LD 894.  With m unicipalities in o ther states 
enacting or attempting t o restrict how we heat or energize homes and business es, it is 
imperative  for Maine to preserve energy choice for its citizens.  LD 894 should be supported to:  
• Allow consumer choice in how to best heat homes to me et their specific needs and 
budget  
• Maintain competition in the energy market to provide choices for consumers  
• Prevent increases in costs to heat homes and businesses  
 
Thank you for considering support of LD 894.
