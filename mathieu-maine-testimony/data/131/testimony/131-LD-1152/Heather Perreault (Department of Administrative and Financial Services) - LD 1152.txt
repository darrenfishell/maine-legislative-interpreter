Testimony of Heather Perreault, Deputy Commissioner 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services 
testifying neither for nor against 
LD 1152, An Act to Make Long-term Disability Insurance Coverage Available to Public 
Employees 
Sponsored by Sen. lngwersen 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing, I am Heather Perreault, Deputy Commissioner of the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services. I am providing testimony today neither for nor against LD 
1152. 
The State of Maine, as Maine’s second largest employer, understands and empathizes that 
Long-Term Disability insurance coverage is a need for some employees. The State interprets 
the language in P.L. 2021 c. 277 “An Act To Improve the Disability Retirement Program of the 
Maine Public Employees Retirement System” to mean that Long-Term Disability Insurance 
coverage must be offered, but that the employer is not obligated to contribute. As is the case 
with any benefit, the State must consider the need, cost and impact to the entirety of its employee 
group, as well as administrative, implementation and oversight efforts. The State would seek to 
balance any Long-Term Disability insurance program with other programs as well as the current 
and future funding requirements of its existing comprehensive benefit package. 
First, some background: LD 1152 is derived from the report “Long-Term Disability insurance — 
Implementation Plan” that was submitted to this committee by MainePERS in November 2022. 
The report was developed by the Long-Term Disability Insurance working group, as required by 
P.L. 2021 c. 277 Sec 43. Specifically, the language is from Appendix A, Draft Legislation, Version 
2: Mandated Employer-Paid Benefit. 
The reason P.L. 2021 c. 277 required examination of Long-Term Disability Insurance was to 
address the gap in income for an injured or ill employee between the time they stop working and 
apply for disability retirement through MainePERS and the time they are approved and begin 
receiving benefits. MainePERS has indicated that over the past four years, there have been on 
average 36 State employees per year who have applied for disability retirement, who would 
potentially need assistance to bridge the gap in income from when they apply for disability

retirement and when they begin receiving benefits. We acknowledge that there may be 
employees who have not applied for Disability Retirement who would benefit from Long-Term 
Disability Insurance, but we are not able to quantify that at this time. 
Results from MainePERS ’ 2019 RFP for Long-Term Disability Insurance estimated that 
providing a benefit of up to $8,000 per month for all State employees would cost between $1.1 
million to $2.7 million per year. Since these estimates are several years old, updated estimates 
would likely be higher. Note - this is the cost for only State employees, and does not include 
estimates for municipalities, schools or other groups. Requiring municipalities and schools to 
provide this benefit would likely be an unfunded mandate, making the State responsible for 90% 
of their costs as well. 
LD 1152 would require the State to provide and pay for a monthly benefit that would replace 
59% of earnings up to $8,000 per month. At this benefit level, it would provide 59% income 
replacement for employees earning up to $163,000 per year; almost 100% of Executive Branch 
employees would have their full earnings covered. 
An alternative to requiring employers to pay for the $8,000 per month benefit is included in the 
“Long-Term Disability Insurance — implementation Plan” report Appendix A, Draft Legislation, 
Version 1, in which the employer can determine an appropriate level of benefit to fund, and 
allows employees to select and pay for additional coverage. This is how the MainePERS life 
insurance benefit currently works. 
Thank you for your time. l am happy to answer any questions you may have.
