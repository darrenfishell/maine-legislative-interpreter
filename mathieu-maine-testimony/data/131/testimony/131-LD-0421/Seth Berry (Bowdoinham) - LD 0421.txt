Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler ,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing 
Committee
on
Energy ,
Utilities
and
T echnology:
my
name
is
Seth
Berry
and
I
live 
in
Bowdoinham.
I
am
here
today
representing
only
myself.
Since
L.D.
421
is
a
concept
draft
it
is
dif ficult
to
discern
the
specific
intent. 
However ,
it
would
appear
to
consider
changes
to
T itle
35-A
§708,
which
directs 
the
PUC’ s
decision
making
in
approving
or
disapproving
utility
reorganizations. 
“Reorganizations”
do
include
mergers
and
acquisitions.
In
the
past
four
years,
the
Legislature
and
this
committee
have
passed
at
least 
two
bills
improving
§708.
First,
In
PL
2019,
c.
353,
§2,
we
directed
the
PUC
to
deny
approval
of
any 
reorganization
that
would
result
in
the
transfer
of
ownership
and
control
of
a 
public
utility ,
unless
the
reorganization
provides
“net
benefits”
to
the
utility's 
ratepayers.
The
previous
standard
was
a
no-harm
standard.
Second,
in
PL
2021,
c.
318,
§5,
we
sought
to
provide
the
PUC
with
modest 
additional
resources
to
address
increasingly
complex
mergers
and
acquisitions. 
While
our
utilities
were
at
one
time
owned
entirely
in
Maine,
today
some
of
them 
are
owned
by
global
corporations,
and
controlled
by
parents
outside
of
Maine 
and
even
outside
of
the
U.S.
This
can
make
it
more
challenging
for
the
PUC
to 
properly
evaluate
a
reorganization.
For
this
reason,
c.
318,
§5
provides
that
if
a 
reorganization
“would
result
in
the
transfer
of
ownership
and
control
of
a
public 
utility
or
the
parent
company
of
a
public
utility ,
the
commission
shall
order
the 
applicant
to
pay
to
the
commission
a
filing
fee
in
an
amount
equal
to
5/100
of
1% 
of
the
transaction
value
as
determined
by
the
commission.”
As
a
general
matter ,
I
strongly
support
additional
ef forts
to
scrutinize
utility 
reorganizations,
and
especially
those
that
result
in
the
transfer
of
ownership
or 
control.
In
recent
decades,
the
common
denominators
of
these
proceedings
have 
been
increasingly
distant
control,
increasing
corporate
complexity ,
and
a
powerful 
army
of
well-paid
lobbyists,
lawyers
and
PR
professionals
swarming
the
state 
and
the
PUC
to
gain
approvals.
Reexamining
our
legal
standards,
and
providing 
additional
resources
to
regulators
to
evaluate
reorganizations,
is
always 
worthwhile
for
these
reasons.
Finally ,
I
should
also
note
that
any
work
you
do
on
this
bill
may
or
may
not 
become
a
“competing
measure”
to
the
Pine
T ree
Power
Company
referendum 
question.
As
we
discussed
with
respect
to
LD
699,
competing
measures
are
alternatives
to
the
main
question,
and
are
put
on
the
ballot
alongside
those 
questions,
as
a
separate
option.
Y ou
are
able,
under
Article
IV ,
Section
18
ofour
state
constitution,
to
create 
competing
measures.
This
is
a
considerable
power ,
and
one
that
should
be 
exercised
carefully .
For
this
reason
I
encourage
discussion
with
the
Attorney 
General
on
this
point
prior
to
voting
for
or
against
any
specific
language,
on 
either
this
bill
or
LD
699.
So
long
as
it
is
reasonable
and
is
written
broadly
to
apply
to
a
category
of 
reorganizations,
as
LD
699
proposes
to
do,
I
would
strongly
support
this 
committee’ s
additional
examination
of
standards.
Thank
you.
I
am
happy
to
try
to
answer
any
questions.
