Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee
 I respectively suggest neither Seth Berry nor Rick Bennett be an examiner for this 
issue.
If you have the power to deny this takeover, use it, be brave, be a warrior for the 
ratepayers. Take down Pine Tree Power.
Yours Truely   Dan McKay
