Good afternoon,  My name is Kristen Silvia, MD and I am an addiction medicine 
physician providing testimony as a private citizen from the town of Buxton.  I have 
worked caring for people with substance use disorder for the past twenty years in 
Maine.  I have cared for hundreds of my fellow citizens over these years and I count 
my work with this population of patients to be the most important and fulfilling of my
career.  My attitude towards treatment and harm reduction have shifted over the years 
and I find myself battling such higly lethal medical conditions now that I feel I must 
testify in support of this bill.  I have lost too many patients to overdose, especially in 
the last several years that fentanyl has ravaged our state.  Despite our efforts to 
expand treatment options, we are still losing too many Mainers.  Fentanyl is outpacing
the work that we do and we struggle to stay ahead of it and other newer deadly 
substances like xylazine that make injection drug use even more dangerous.
Harm reduction sites have been in existence around the world for years, and now 
include successful programs in New York.  Overdoses are reversed every day and 
lives are saved.  These are lives that are being connected to resources and treatment 
that can eventually help people turn their lives around, when and if they are ready to 
do so. There is no evidence that harm reduction sites encourage or enable drug use, 
but they do make it safer.  There is evidence that people who utilize these sites are 
more likely to enter into treatment and recovery.  There is certainly evidence that 
these sites lower the risk of medical complications like HIV and hepatitis.  
We are in a public health crisis and in times like this we need to take brave and bold 
steps to intervene.  It is not the time for moralistic decision-making.  It is the time for 
making decisions based on science and fact.  My patients lives depend on it.
