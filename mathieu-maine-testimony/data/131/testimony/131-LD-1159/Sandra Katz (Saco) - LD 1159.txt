LD 1159
I am writing in support of LD1159, an act to establish a pilot project regarding harm 
reduction and health centers.
Studying this and trying it out seems a logical response to our drug overdoes problem.
These centers are all over the world and have had excellent results. These centers save
lives and we need to do whatever we can to address that need.
Thank you for your time.
