LD 1159
I am a faculty member at the University of Southern Maine and one of my major 
areas of scholarship is drug policy reform. I am writing you today in strong support of
LD 1159: An Act to Establish a Pilot Project Regarding Harm Reduction Health 
Centers (sponsored by Rep. Laurie Osher). As you know, the bill would create a 
two-year pilot program to establish harm reduction health centers. It is clear from the 
research from Canada and Western Europe that community-based resource centers 
that offer both supervised safe consumption and other disease-prevention and 
recovery-assistance services dramatically reduce overdose deaths and disease 
transmission. New York has recently opened a center like this and other states are 
moving in that direction (including Rhode Island which just passed legislation to 
allow the creation of these sorts of centers). Over 700 people died in our state of drug 
overdoses last year alone. This is a health crisis. I urge you to act by supporting LD 
1159.
