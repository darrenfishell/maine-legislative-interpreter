 Testimony in Suppor t of LD 1159  
 “An Act t o Establish a Pilot Pr oject Regar ding Harm Reduction Health Centers”  
 Hello Senat or Baldacci, Repr esentativ e Me yer, and distinguished members of the Joint  
 Standing Committee on Health and Human Ser vices. My name is Scott Harriman and I  
 am writing in suppor t of LD 1159, “ An Act t o Establish a Pilot Pr oject Regar ding Harm  
 Reduction Health Centers. ” 
 Maine is experiencing an epidemic of substance use disor der, with hundr eds of our  
 family members, friends, and neighbors dying e very year of accidental o verdoses.  
 Establishing mor e harm r eduction centers will help sa ve lives by providing a place for  
 people t o use substances in a saf er manner . 
 These centers ar e not simply places t o use substances under super vision. The y also  
 provide drug checking, which helps r educe risk b y scr eening for f entanyl or other  
 adulter ants; healthcar e ser vices, including testing for communicable diseases; and  
 access t o treatment and r ecovery resour ces. 
 People with substance use disor der will continue t o use substances whether or not the y 
 have access t o a harm r eduction center . The diff erence is that ha ving mor e of these  
 centers will r esult in f ewer needles on the gr ound, f ewer public or unattended  
 overdoses, lower costs for municipalities b y reducing the number of emer gency calls,  
 and — most impor tantly — f ewer of our lo ved ones dying.  
 Please v ote Ought T o Pass on LD 1159. Thank y ou for y our time.  
 Sincer ely, 
 Scott A. Harriman (he/him)
