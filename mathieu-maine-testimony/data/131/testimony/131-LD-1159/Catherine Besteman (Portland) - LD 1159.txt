LD 1159
Dear Esteemed Members of the Health and Human Services Committee,
I write to support LD 1159. Nationwide, we are shifting from an approach to drug use
that is based in punishment to one based in harm reduction. A punitive approach only 
causes more harm, more suffering, more vulnerability, and a negatively impactful 
cycle of taxpayer dollars spent on things that do not work, like incarceration. We need
this bill in Maine because we need to pivot toward an approach to drug use that saves 
lives. This bill will help to get us there by authorizing the creation of a 2-year pilot 
project to establish and operate a harm reduction health center, approved by the local 
community where the center will be located. The bill protects the State from liability 
and tracks the effectiveness of the program, an important protocol that will provide 
empirical evidence about the wisdom of shifting to a new approach. We already have 
empirical evidence about the failure of the old approach (using incarceration and 
policing to stop drug use). The harm reduction health center approach has been 
successful in Rhode Island and we have nothing to lose and everything to gain by 
trying it here in Maine as well. I urge you to vote yes on LD 1159.
Sincerely
Catherine Besteman
