to the Committee on Health and Human Services  
February 1, 20 22 
Senator Baldacci , Represent ative Moore, and members of the 
Health and Human Services Committee :  
My name is Peter Lehman and I live in Thomaston. I am a formerly 
incarcerated citizen and a person in long -term r ecovery.  I am 
testifying in favor of LD 1 159 on behalf of the Maine Prisoner 
Advocacy Coalition whose goal is to promote restorative practices 
in order to increase public safety and the health of our community.  
As members of this committee and knowledgeable policymakers of 
Maine, y ou know that punitive responses to drug use don't work.  
You have also been leaders in helping to make great strides 
towards ending the criminalization and stigma of people who use drugs.   This is vital to the safety a nd well- being of Mainers.  
Harm Reduction Health Centers are the next st ep in this process, 
following the lead of other countries and states including Rhode 
Island in 2021.  
This needs -based model is consistent with best practices 
recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention ( CDC) and is an effe ctive way of increasing safety and 
decreasing injury and death.  
We urge you to support LD 1159 .
