LD 1159
Dear Senate Chair Joe Baldacci, House Chair Michele Meyer, and esteemed members
of the Health and Human Services Committee-
I am writing in support of LD 1159 - An Act to Establish a Pilot Project Regarding 
Harm Reduction Health Centers. I am a trained clinical social worker and I have 
previously worked in a hard reduction drop in center in Chicago. 
Just like so many things in our society, substance use interventions exist on a 
continuum and harm reduction programs serve people at any and all intensity of their 
substance use. Supervised substance use harm reduction sites are imperative to 
responding to the epidemic we are experiencing regarding opiate overdoses. It allows 
people to be met without judgement and engage in conversation about their use and 
other stressors they are experiencing. 
They allow for drug testing so that someone knows what they are putting in their 
body. This is especially necessary as Xylazine, also known as “Tranq,” begins to 
spread as an additive to drugs being marketed as heroin and fentanyl. Tranq does not 
respond to Naloxone since it isn’t an opiate, and it can result in terrible necrotic 
wounds which can require amputation. 
People who use illicit substances cannot reduce the risk of their behaviors if they die 
by overdose or are rejected from traditional treatment centers that require strict 
abstinence. We need options available to reach everyone who uses substances, no one 
is disposable or expendable. 
Thank you for considering my testimony as this process moves forward.
