I am a physician who has been practicing in Maine for 20 years. I have been working 
in the field of treating substance use disorder for over 16 years. My experience has 
been real-life, hands on, not academic or speaking from behind a desk. 
As I tell my patients and my med students, doctors are only allowed to have opinions 
when there is no evidence. If there is evidence, we need to follow it and act 
accordingly. 
The evidence on harm reduction is robust, and clearly demonstrates that harm 
reduction interventions do NOT result in greater use of drugs or greater damage to 
communities. What harm reduction provides is fewer new cases of blood borne illness
from needle exposure, fewer used needles out in the community posing a public 
health risk, and most importantly, fewer deaths by opioid poisoning. Harm reduction 
allows real people, who are loved by other real people, a chance to move forward and 
stay alive, even if they have made a mistake or are engaged in activity which may be 
unsafe. Everyone deserves a chance to wake up to a new day.
