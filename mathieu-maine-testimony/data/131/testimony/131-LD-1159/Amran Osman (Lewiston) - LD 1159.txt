LD 1159
Good Afternoon, My name is Amran Osman; I live in  Lewiston, Maine, and I'm 
sharing my Testimony on LD 1159  An Act to Establish a Pilot Project Regarding 
Harm Reduction Health Centers. First and foremost, I'd like to thank Representative 
Laurie Osher for sponsoring this LD because if passed it will impact many people in 
our community significantly. 
These centers have already been established all over the world, and they have worked 
tremendously in saving lives. There is no loss in establishing these centers, only the 
saving of lives. As someone who has grown up in Maine, I've seen too many of my 
peers and community members  die from substance use disorder, and its time that we 
do something about it if establishing these harm reduction health centers can save 
lives then it should be done 
I believe it's essential to pass this bill because  There's a need for harm reduction 
efforts in Maine and this would be a massive step in the right direction this will 
directly support the goals to reduce overdose deaths in Maine. These centers would 
reduce improperly discarded syringes, public overdoses, and ems calls by responding 
to overdoses onsite, and these would all equal cost savings for the community. It has 
already been established that these centers work its time for Maine to take the 
initiative and take a step forward and pass this bill.
