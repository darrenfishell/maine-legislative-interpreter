Greetings
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer
and
other
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
My
name
is
Courtney
Gary-Allen.
I
am
the
Or ganizing
Director
for
the
Maine
Recovery
Advocacy
Project
(ME-RAP).
I
also
have
the
honor
of
serving
my
community
as
an
At-Lar ge
City
Councilor
in
Augusta,
which
makes
me
one
of
the
municipal
of ficers
that
would
have
an
opportunity
to
vote
in
favor
of
a
harm
reduction
health
center
in
my
community
if
LD
1 159
passes!
I
am
here
today
to
testify
in
favor
of
LD
1 159
on
behalf
of
our
network.
I
do
not
need
to
tell
your
committee
how
many
of
our
friends,
neighbors,
and
community
members
have
died
from
an
accidental
overdose
last
year .
Y our
committee
has
heard
it
time
and
time
again.
Y our
committee
has
considered
and
approved
countless
initiatives
that
seek
to
save
the
lives
of
people
who
use
drugs:
treatment
facilities,
recovery
community
centers,
recovery
housing,
syringe
service
programs,
and
more.
All
of
these
are
important
tools
that
we
need
more
of
on
the
front
lines
of
the
substance
use
crisis
in
Maine.
But
none
of
these
things
have
a
100%
ef fective
rate.
As
you’ve
heard
today ,
Harm
Reduction
Health
Centers
(HRHC)
do.
There
are
currently
over
120
of
these
centers
across
the
world
and
there
has
never
been
a
fatal
overdose
in
a
Harm
Reduction
Health
Center ,
ever ,
in
the
entire
world.
The
bottom
line
is
this
is
about
saving
lives.
LD
1 159
seeks
to
do
this
by
authorizing
the
creation
of
these
centers
in
communities
that
want
them.
I
think
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
nothing
in
this
bill
requires
any
town,
city ,
or
community
to
allow
a
center
to
open.
Actually
quite
the
contrary ,
this
bill
requires
that
any
or ganization
seeking
to
open
a
harm
reduction
health
center
receive
an
approval
to
do
so
by
the
local
legislative
body
responsible
for
that
community .

H e a l t h
C e n t e r s
Futhoremore,
while
this
bill
is
called
a
pilot
project,
it
is
simply
called
that
because
it
has
a
sunset
clause,
not
because
it
is
asking
the
Maine
State
Legislature
to
fund
it.
Harm
reduction
and
recovery
advocates
will
be
following
the
lead
of
RI
by
requesting
Opioid
Settlement
monies,
either
through
the
AG’ s
pot
of
money ,
the
Maine
Recovery
Council,
or
at
the
county
or
city
level.
If
none
of
those
funding
sources
are
available,
we
will
seek
private
foundation
funding
or
philanthropy
to
support
these
centers.
T o
put
it
simply:
This
legislation
costs
the
State
nothing,
gives
the
power
to
communities
to
choose
if
this
works
for
them,
and
will
save
lives.
W e
are
just
asking
you
to
let
us
try
this.
Please
pass
this
legislation,
give
us
two
years,
let
us
come
back
to
you
and
show
you
the
impact
it
will
have.
Just
let
us
save
our
friends'
lives.
Thank
you,
Courtney
