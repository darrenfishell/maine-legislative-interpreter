Testimony in favor of LD 1159
Monday, April 10th, 2023
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services
My name is Jon Courtney, a resident of Cape Elizabeth and I am writing to express 
my support for LD 1159: An Act to Establish Pilot Project Regarding Harm 
Reduction Health Centers.  I am a parent and a long-time resident of Maine and 
believe we should be offering protective and connective measures for those struggling
with substance use and believe this bill offered an avenue to increase safety and 
mitigate the losses felt by those struggling with addiction.
Last year, Maine lost 716 people to overdose, a tragic record that highlights the 
ongoing urgency of the opioid epidemic that continues to ravage our state.  Current 
efforts are clearly inadequate in addressing the breadth of the situation and it is time 
for Maine to stand amongst global leaders in harm reduction and pilot a program to 
help reduce the impact of substance use upon our citizens.
Overdose prevention sites offer a safe harbor for those in our community who use 
drugs, to find protection and oversight and help to mitigate the onslaught of overdose 
deaths.  Other pilot programs around the world have demonstrated that connection 
and community provide greater safety and help reduce the shame and stigma 
associated with unsupervised usage.  I believe a pilot program to examine the 
potential effectiveness of a center here in Maine would provide both an impactful 
opportunity to save lives.
I hope you will consider supporting this measure.  Thank you for your work and 
thoughtfulness around this issue.  I hope you will join in supporting LD1159.
Sincerely,
Jon Courtney
Cape Elizabeth, Maine
