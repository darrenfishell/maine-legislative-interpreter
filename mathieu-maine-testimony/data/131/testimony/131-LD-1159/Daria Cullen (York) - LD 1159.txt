LD 1159
I am writing to you today in support of LD 1159 because I believe Harm Reduction 
Centers are critical to saving lives. Having recently learned about this pilot program it
made me hopeful that we recognize there’s a health crisis in Maine and the resources 
currently available are insufficient. As someone who has lost loved ones to addiction 
the tragedy really is in the lack of understanding and support they received. Had there 
been a harm reduction center available to them I have no doubt they would be alive 
today. My family is only one of too many affected by addiction. There’s enough 
research and studies done to support this initiative. Please let the evidence speak for 
itself and vote ought to pass. Thank you.
