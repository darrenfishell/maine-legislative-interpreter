 I am a person who is in long term recovery of a 36 year SUD I was also a member of 
the unhoused community. And the only reason I am able to be here today is because 
harm reduction was outreached to me when I lived on the streets. I was educated 
although slowly it sunk in eventually and this led me into Greater Portland Health 
where I was put on suboxone as an MAT my IV and smoke using got further in 
between I began to save money and eventually was able to get an apartment I then 
eventually weaned myself of the subs and I am proud to say as of this July I have 
been housed for over 5 years and 100% free of all substances. If it wasnt for street 
outreach and the practices of harm reduction I would definitely be a statistic and 
another life lost to an overdose. Nobody will get sober when someone else wants 
them too it will be on each individuals time and circumstance harm reduction helps 
keep them alive until they are in that spot. And I am the poster child of this and the 
proof that it works it saves lives and then we can turn around and help the next 
person!
