Dear
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer
and
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services;
My
name
is
Courtney
Gary-Allen.
I
am
the
Or ganizing
Director
of
the
Maine
Recovery
Advocacy
Project.
I
am
writing
today
to
directly
address
the
testimony
of
Governor
Mills
in
opposition
to
LD
1 159:
An
Act
to
Establish
a
Pilot
Project
Regarding
Harm
Reduction
Health
Centers.
While
we
are
disappointed
with
the
fact
that
Governor
Mills
is
attempting
to
block
a
life
saving
measure
for
people
who
use
drugs,
we
remain
hopeful
that
once
again
our
allies
in
the
State
Legislature
will
send
a
clear
message
to
the
Governor
that
in
Maine
we
believe
that
people
who
use
drugs
do
not
deserve
to
die.
Harm
reduction
health
centers
continue
to
be
the
only
life
saving
intervention
that
has
a
100%
ef fective
rate
of
keeping
our
friends,
family ,
and
community
members
alive.
In
the
face
of
such
devastating
loss
and
in
the
words
of
Governor
Mills
herself:
W e
must
not
rest
till
we
reduce
overdose
deaths
to
zero.
Harm
reduction
health
centers
are
one
of
the
many
evidence-based
strategies
needed
to
accomplish
that.
And
now
I
will
respond
to
each
of
Governor
Mills
points:
1.
Governor
Mills
T estimony:
Federal
law
prohibits
the
operation
of
such
a
“safe
consumption
site.”
While
two
such
facilities
have
operated
in
New
Y ork
City
for
one
and
one-half
years,
there
has
been
no
statement
by
the
Department
of
Justice
as
to
its
intention
regarding
such
facilities.
Even
if
there
were,
this
could
change
with
a
new
administration
without
a
change
in
the
law .
The
Rhode
Island
legislature
authorized
the
establishment
of
such
a
facility
in
2021,
but
that
facility
has
not
opened
and
it
is
not
scheduled
to
open
until
2024.
None
of
the
other
48
states
have
an
authorized
safe
consumption
site
operating.
a.
Our
Response:
Federal
law
also
prohibits
the
cultivation,
use,
and
possession
of
cannabis.
That
has
not
stopped
Maine
from
legalizing,
regulating,
and
taxing
it
anyways.
If
we
accept
Governor
Mill’ s
ar gument,
we
are
essentially
saying
that
we
can
break
the
law
so
that
Maine
can
take
in
millions
of
dollars
in
cannabis
tax
revenue
but
we
cannot
break
the
law
so
that
people
don’ t
die
from
drug
use.

b.
The
Governor's
testimony
overstates
the
finality
of
federal
law
on
this
matter .
In
reality ,
federal
law
is
unclear
at
best.
Sites
are
currently
operating
in
New
Y ork
City
and
the
Biden
Administration
has
not
prosecuted
them.
Rhode
Island’ s
site
was
delayed
due
to
administrative
issues
resulting
from
the
pandemic
and
has
full
support
from
state
leadership.
The
staf f
are
working
as
fast
as
they
can
to
open
as
quickly
as
possible.
c.
Safe
House,
the
harm
reduction
health
center
in
Philly
sued
by
the
T rump
Administration,
is
currently
in
negotiations
with
the
Department
of
Justice
about
the
operation
of
their
centers.
In
the
coming
days,
advocates
expect
the
DOJ
to
put
out
a
statement
in
favor
of
these
centers.
d.
When
the
Governor
claims
that
these
sites
violate
federal
law
she
is
saying
that
the
sites
exist
only
for
the
purpose
of
using
drugs.
That
is
not
true.
Harm
Reduction
Health
Centers
are
for
the
purpose
of
providing
necessary
medical
care
for
a
population
who
finds
medical
care
not
accessible
due
to
stigma,
lack
of
insurance
or
transportation.
e.
The
State
already
encourages
supervised
consumption
through
their
OPTIONS
program,
“Don’ t
use
alone”
PR
campaigns,
fentanyl
test
strips
and
naloxone
distribution.
Governor
Mills
talks
about
how
much
Naloxone
she
has
distributed,
the
Good
Sam
Law
encourages
people
to
call
91 1,
and
OPTIONS
tells
people
to
use
drugs
in
groups.
The
only
dif ference
between
that
and
a
harm
reduction
health
center
is
4
walls,
a
roof,
and
a
doctor .
2.
Governor
Mills
T estimony:
While
there
are
many
(proponents
note
at
least
200)
facilities
operating
in
some
other
countries,
there
is
no
model
that
we
are
aware
of
that
has
operated
in
a
primarily
rural
state.
a.
Our
Response:
Maine
is
not
just
a
rural
state.
W e
also
have
cities
-
like
Lewiston,
Bangor ,
and
Portland.
These
communities
are
struggling
with
public
drug
use
and
skyrocketing
overdoses.
They
should
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
if
they
want
to
have
this
tool
in
their
tool
box.
b.
Furthermore,
the
rural
areas
of
the
State
of
Maine
face
some
of
the
lar gest
obstacles
to
recovery
and
greatest
danger
of
overdose.
The
isolation
means
many
are
using
drugs
alone,
which
we
know
puts
them
at
the
greatest
danger
of
preventable
overdose.
The
inherent
lack
of
transportation
means
that
treatment
is
not
accessible.
There
is
a
clause
in
the
bill
that
a
mobile
unit
could
be
created
if
a
rural
community
chose
to
take
that
route.

Governor
Mills
T estimony:
While
there
was
testimony
at
the
public
hearing
stating
there
would
be
no
cost
to
the
taxpayers,
in
fact,
the
operation
of
the
facility
would
likely
be
the
responsibility
of
the
state
as
the
DHHS
would
be
contracting
out
the
operation
and
none
of
the
services
would
be
eligible
for
MaineCare
reimbursement
or
covered
by
any
commercial
health
insurance.
And
the
operational
cost,
based
upon
the
facilities
we
have
reviewed
in
New
Y ork
City
and
in
Montreal,
Canada
would
be
substantial.
The
medical
staf fing
and
security
costs
alone
would
be
costly .
A
fiscal
note
has
not
yet
been
developed
but,
for
reference,
the
budget
for
the
operator
of
the
two
sites
in
NYC
is
currently
$17.3
million.
a.
Our
Response:
The
intention
of
the
advocates
is
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
RI,
who
used
$2.6
million
dollars
in
opioid
settlement
funds
to
fund
the
creation
of
two
harm
reduction
health
centers.
W e
do
not
want
funding
from
the
Maine
State
Legislature,
as
there
is
funding
available
from
other
sources,
including
the
Opioid
Settlement
monies,
both
state
and
local,
as
well
as
private
funders.
If
the
language
of
the
bill
requires
that
the
State
funds
it,
change
the
language
of
the
bill.
b.
T o
use
the
cost
evaluation
of
sites
in
NYC
is
grievously
wrong.
The
population
that
these
two
sites
serve
is
8.8
million
people,
while
the
population
of
the
entire
state
of
Maine
is
only
1.3
million
people.
4.
Governor
Mills
T estimony:
The
other
services
specified
in
the
bill
–
specifically
health
service
referrals
–
are
supports
we
already
provide
in
eighteen
recovery
community
centers
across
the
state.
Only
two
counties,
Somerset
and
W aldo,
are
presently
without
such
a
center
and
we
are
actively
working
with
individuals
and
or ganizations
in
each
of
those
counties
to
look
at
sites
for
a
potential
recovery
community
center .
a.
Our
Response:
While
we
appreciate
the
Governor ’ s
commitment
to
recovery
community
centers
across
Maine,
a
recovery
community
center
(RCC)
is
not
the
appropriate
place
for
someone
who
is
actively
using
drugs.
Though
built
upon
multiple
pathways
of
recovery ,
RCCs
need
to
maintain
a
chemical
free
environment
to
be
inclusive
to
the
abstinence
based
recovery
models.
Due
to
this
people
who
are
currently
using
often
find
themselves
pushed
away
from
these
spaces.
Furthermore,
if
referrals
to
health
services
through
recovery
centers
were
an
ef fective
strategy ,
we
wouldn’ t
be
seeing
the
alarming
number
of
infections,
untreated
mental
health
concerns
and
people
unable
to
access
substance
use
treatment.

Governor
Mills
T estimony:
There
is
insuf ficient
evidence
to
date
that
safe
use
sites
encourage
individuals
to
find
a
pathway
to
recovery .
Given
the
lethality
of
the
current
drug
supply ,
we
should
be
doing
all
we
can
to
encourage
individuals
to
find
a
pathway
to
recovery ,
as
continuing
to
use
in
this
environment
all
too
frequently
results
in
a
fatal
overdose.
Eighty
percent
of
Maine’ s
fatal
overdoses
last
year
involved
fentanyl,
which
acts
quickly
and
is
50
to
100
times
more
lethal
than
morphine.
Only
two
milligrams
of
fentanyl
is
considered
a
potentially
lethal
dose.
Given
that
an
individual
would
be
unlikely
to
–
and
may
not
be
able
to
–
use
the
facility
in
every
instance
(the
NYC
facilities
are
open
only
12
to
14
hours
per
day
and
only
5
days
per
week),
the
establishment
of
such
a
site
may
actually
increase
the
risk
to
users
by
creating
a
false
sense
of
security
in
ongoing
use.
a.
Our
Response:
This
is
just
fundamentally
untrue.
There
is
over
3
decades
of
research
that
show
that
harm
reduction
health
centers
save
lives,
reduce
syringe
waste,
and
help
people
get
into
treatment.
Furthermore,
the
danger
is
exactly
the
reason
we
should
allow
the
creation
of
harm
reduction
health
centers
-
not
the
reason
we
shouldn’ t.
The
bottom
line
is
that
dead
people
do
not
recover .
People
will
continue
to
use
whether
or
not
there
is
fentanyl,
so
we
need
to
use
whatever
tools
we
have
available
to
keep
our
citizens
in
Maine
safe.
b.
Harm
Reduction
Health
Centers
give
people
time.
They
may
not
be
ready
to
stop
using
drugs
today
but
maybe
they
will
be
ready
tomorrow .
These
sites
ensure
that
they
make
it
there.
c.
W e
agree
with
Governor
Mills
that
every
Mainer
deserves
access
to
a
pathway
of
recovery
that
works
for
them.
Recovery
is
defined
by
SAMSA
as
“
a
process
of
change
through
which
individuals
improve
their
health
and
wellness,
live
a
self-directed
life,
and
strive
to
reach
their
full
potential
.”
Harm
reduction
is
recovery
and
harm
reduction
health
center
will
provide
a
new
pathway
of
recovery
in
Maine.
d.
T wo
milligrams
of
fentanyl
is
considered
a
potentially
lethal
dose
for
someone
who
has
never
done
fentanyl.
T wo
milligrams
for
a
person
who
uses
fentanyl
every
day
is
not
a
lethal
dose.
T olerance
builds
the
longer
someone
uses
opioids
and
individuals
use
varies.
Scare
tactics
like
these
are
harmful
and
inaccurate.
Additionally ,
non-pharmaceutical
fentanyl
is
not
“pure
fentanyl”
and
contains
additives
and
adulterants.
.
e.
Governor
Mills,
Gordon
Smith,
harm
reduction
and
recovery
advocates
alike
agree
that
people
who
use
drugs
die
most
often
because
they
are
using
drugs
alone.
Harm
Reduction
Health
Centers
fix
that
problem:
people
don't
have
to
use

alone
and
therefore
don't
die.
At
the
core
of
this
bill
is
our
collective
desire
to
save
lives.
This
is
a
bill
that
will
save
lives.

of
the
time.

At
Insite
Supervised
Injection
Site,
the
first
overdose
prevention
facility
in
North
America,
which
began
operating
in
V ancouver ,
British
Columbia,
Canada,
in
2003,
one
study
found
that
the
fatal
overdose
rate
in
the
area
around
the
site
fell
by
35%
after
it
opened.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21497898/
g.
Additionally ,
the
programs
help
increase
entry
into
substance
use
disorder
treatment
programs,
according
to
Kallenach.
Another
study
found
that
more
than
half
of
users
at
Insite
entered
addiction
treatment
within
two
years.
https://www .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590717/

Additionally ,
harm
reduction
health
centers
reduce
public
drug
use
and
the
amount
of
public
discarded
syringe
waste
by
of fering
indoor
spaces
for
people
who
are
unhoused
and/or
who
use
drugs
to
manage
their
disease,
instead
of
in
public
places
like
parks.

i.
This
is
the
part
that
we
think
is
important
for
Cities
like
Bangor ,
Lewiston,
and
Portland,
who
struggle
with
people
using
drugs
in
parks
and
public
places
(like
libraries
and
recovery
centers)
-
which
none
of
us
want.
6.
Age
of
Harm
Reduction
Health
Center
Participants:
Governor
Mills
testimony
implies
that
harm
reduction
health
centers
would
allow
young
people
to
receive
services
there.
Advocates
believe
that
harm
reduction
health
centers
should
be
required
to
follow
the
same
SSP
rules
that
already
exist
in
the
State,
which
means
that
people
under
18
would
not
be
eligible
for
services
at
a
harm
reduction
health
center .
The
time
has
come
to
set
aside
false
belief
systems
that
continue
to
have
no
ef fect
on
the
number
of
Mainer ’ s
dying
of
preventable
overdose
deaths
for
evidence-based
interventions
that
save
lives,
reduce
syringe
waste,
and
help
people
get
into
treatment
when
they
are
ready .
Thank
you.
I
am
happy
to
answer
any
questions.
