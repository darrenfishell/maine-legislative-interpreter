TESTIMONY OF 
RANDALL A. LIBERTY, COMMISSIONER 
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS 
In Opposition to 
LD 433 Resolve, Directing the Commissioner of Corrections and the Commissioner of Health and Human 
Services to Establish a Working Group on the Relocation of the Division of Juvenile Services 
Before theI 
Criminal Justice Public Safety Committee 
April 24, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center and Representative Salisbury and other distinguished members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, I am Randall Liberty, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections 
providing testimony in opposition to LD 433. 
As this committee has heard quite a bit this session, the Maine Department of Corrections is thoughtfully 
continuing the work started during the 129th and l30‘h Legislatures to improve services for juveniles involved 
with the justice system. 
You have heard about the millions of dollars in funding that goes to community provides, you’ve heard about 
the enhanced training for staff, you’d heard about the community-based residences for young people, ACER 
and Unity Place that are open and operating, and you’ve heard about the plans to open a third community-based 
residences for youth on the grounds of Goodwill Hinkley. 
LD 433 would dismantle the work and plans put forward by the legislature, by advocates, by working groups, 
and many people in this room. A working group whose goal is to move the Division of Juvenile services sends 
the wrong message and at great expense of money and time. 
Incredible improvements have been made in the last few years. Let’s not negate all the progress We’ve seen 
with juvenile services by refocusing staff time on the act of moving an entire state division. This will not bea 
good use of DOC’s time, nor DHHS’s time and will result in youth falling through the cracks. 
The Department asks you to vote ONTP on this bill and allow the MDOC to continue forward on the plans 
already enshrined in statute, already working. 
Thank You, 
Randall A. Liberty, Commissioner 
Maine Department of Corrections
