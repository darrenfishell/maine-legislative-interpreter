FREE OUR KIDS.  Set up the committee
Talk to teachers.  Add support people in classrooms
Free our kids & remember their brains are not fully formed, as we examine the 
choices they make.
I support practices for restorative justice & dignity for all.
I reject increasing arrests, jails and the US punitive culture which is a proven failure.
