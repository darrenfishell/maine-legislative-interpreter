Testimony of Representative Morgan Rzelly m support of 
LD 273, “An Act to Provide Funds to the Malaga 1912 Scholarship Fund” 
Before the Joint Standmg Committee on Education & Cultural Ajfazrs 
Good afternoon Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs My name is Morgan Rielly, andI 
represent House District 127, which includes part of Westbrook I am here today as a co-sponsor 
for LD 273: An Act to Provide Funds to the Malaga 1912 Scholarship Fund 
I’ve spent a lot of time on the New Meadows River It’s one of the most beautiful parts of Maine, 
but it is also the site of one of Mame’s most shameﬁil and disgusting acts of racism From the 
mid-1800s until the early 1900s, Malaga Island was home to a racially diverse ﬁshing village 
Many of its residents were of black and biracial backgrounds Mame’s state government evicted 
these families from Malaga Island ni 1912 along with the incredibly cruel act of exhuming the 
graves of Malaga and movmg them to Pineland m order to erase their past 
One of the last residents of Malaga Island, Lottie Marks Blackwell, died in 1997 This dark 
chapter m our state’s history 1S not of some distant past We owe it to their descendants to fully 
fimd this scholarship I urge this committee to vote ought to pass 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration 
District 127 Westbrook
