L D 273, “An Act to Prov1de Funds to the Malaga 1912 Scholarslnp Fund” 
Senator Rafferty, Representatlve Brennan, and Members of the Jo1nt Standlng Comm1ttee on 
Educat1on and Cultural Affa1rs, my name 1s Kate McBr1en and I am the Mame State Arclnvlst I am 
speakmg today Ne1ther For, Nor Agalnst L D 273 
In add1t10n to servmg as your Ma1ne State Arch1v1st, I am also an h1stonan of the Malaga IslandI 
commumty I was the curator for the award-wlmnng exh1b1t1on “Malaga Island, Fragmented L1ves” 
on v1ew at the Ma1ne State Musemn from 2012 to 2013 and had the honor to serve on the prevlous 
scholarsh1p ﬁmd comm1ttee From 2015 through 2018, we d1str1buted $350,000 granted by the State 
of Mame to the dlrect descendants of those evlcted from the1r Malaga Island homes The ﬁmds were 
Well managed by the Mame Commumty Foundat1on, who also were very generous w1th the1r 
support of the Scholarsh1p Comm1ttee 
I am proud to share the Comm1ttee was able to send dozens of people to school We supported 
students earmng degrees 1n programs rang1ng from nursmg, to eng1neer1ng, to psychology Whlle 
scholarslnps never fully funded a student’s entlre educatlon expenence, 1t greatly ass1sted many to 
reduce the amount of debt lncurred by attendmg school I know of one scholarshlp rec1p1ent who 
Went on to open her own thr1v1ng busmess 
Per state regulatlons at the t1me, the Scholarsh1p Comm1ttee was g1ven ﬁve years 1n wh1ch we were 
requ1red to fully d1str1bute the prov1ded funds We tr1ed to spread the ava1lable funds to as many 
people as poss1ble, but the need was so great that we exhausted the ftmds w1tlnn three and half 
years For several years after, I contmued to hear from descendants of the Malaga Island 
commumty, askmg 1f there would be more scholarshlp funds made avallable as the need contlnued 
Th1s concludes my testnnony I am happy to answer any questlons the comm1ttee may have Thank 
you
