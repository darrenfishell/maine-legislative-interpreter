THE MAINE SENATE 
131st Legislature 
Testimony of Senator Richard A. Bennett 
Presenting LD 73, An Act to Require Bottled Water Companies to Monitor for 
Perﬂuoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
28 April 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Committee on Health and Human 
Services, I am Senator Rick Bennett of Oxford, and I have the honor of serving l4 communities 
in Westem Maine in the State Senate. I am pleased to sponsor LD 73, “An Act to Require 
Bottled Water Companies to Monitor for Perﬂuoroalkyl and Polyﬂuoroalkyl Substances. ” 
The purpose of this bill is to hold bottled water companies to the same standard applicable to 
community water systems. I expect the Maine people already believe the safety standards for 
commercial water that is extracted from our springs, wells, and reservoirs, is the same as the 
water running from their faucet. No matter the water source, it should be treated with the same 
safety and security. 
Thank you for your consideration. I would be happy to answer any questions.
