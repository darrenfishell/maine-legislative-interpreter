Dear Senator Grohski, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation:
The Department of Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry (DACF) is neither for nor against LD 
641, An Act to Combat Hunger by Creating an Income Tax Credit for Businesses Engaged in 
Food Production for Donations to Qualified Organizations.
LD 641 would recognize and provide incentives to Maine food producers who are a part of our 
state’s response to hunger and food insecurity. Current regulations allow farmers and food 
producers to deduct some portion of the value of donated products from their taxable income. 
However, we have heard from producers that calculating that deduction is complicated and, at 
the same time, significantly undervalues the donated food, leading many contributing farmers to 
forego the deduction altogether. By recognizing and rewarding Maine producers who are 
contributing to emergency feeding organizations, LD 641 could create an additional mechanism 
for channeling high-quality Maine food to individuals and families in need.
Additionally, DACF notes that incentivizing food donations is also a form of food waste 
reduction. It has been estimated by the United States Department of Agriculture that 40% of all 
food produced in the United States is wasted, which equates to 133 billion pounds of food each 
year. Encouraging donations of food that may otherwise go to waste has the potential to put extra 
money into farmers’ pockets while also putting more Maine food onto food-insecure Mainers’ 
plates. 
As the home of several programs combating food insecurity in Maine and as the department that 
stewards our agricultural economy, DACF is supportive of efforts that both reward our hard-
working food producers and that get as much Maine food as possible onto the plates of those 
who need it.
Sincerely,
Craig Lapine, Director
Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources
