RE:
LD
1621,
An
Act
Regarding
Envir onmental
Justice
Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1621,
An
Act
Regarding
Environmental
Justice,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
In
Maine
and
across
the
world,
climate
change
poses
the
greatest
threats
to
communities
that
are
already
mar ginalized,
overburdened,
and
underserved.
People
who
live
in
substandard
housing,
who
are
experiencing
homelessness,
or
who
lack
reliable
transportation
are
more
vulnerable
to
the
impacts
of
extreme
weather
caused
by
climate
change.
Maine
lacks
a
protective
legal
framework
to
ensure
that
environmental
policies
to
combat
climate
change
are
developed,
implemented,
and
enforced
in
close
partnership
with
the
communities
impacted
“first
and
worst”
by
climate
threats.
LD
1621
would
create
such
a
framework,
consistent
with
the
Maine
Climate
Council’ s
Equity
Subcommittee’ s
recommendations.
Maine
Audubon
supports
this
bill
as
a
leading
strategy
to
provide
long-overdue
protections
to
Maine’ s
most
underserved
communities.
W e
ur ge
the
Committee
to
join
us
in
our
support.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
