Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, l am Mark 
Margerum, Policy and Procedures Coordinator for the Department of Environmental 
Protection. I am speaking in support of LD 1621, but recommend amending the bill to 
ensure alignment with federal environmental regulations and grant programs. 
2021 Resolve, chapter 279 required the Governor's Office of Policy, Innovation and the 
Future (GOPIF) to, specifically, develop definitions for “environmental justice,"

“environmental justice populations, ” “frontline communities" and any other terms 
determined by the office to be necessary for the incorporation of equity considerations 
in decision making at the Department. In 2022, GOPIF and the Department provided 
recommendations to utilize definitions of those terms provided by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency to ensure our state programs would align with federal 
requirements that were already under development. The recommendations pertaining 
to the Department were embodied in L.D. 2018, but were removed from that bill before 
its final passage due to lack of funding necessary to implement its procedural 
requirements. 
While Maine’s Legislature was considering how to incorporate environmental justice 
considerations into the Department ’s programs, many of which are under delegated 
authority by the EPA, the Biden Administration and EPA were rapidly developing federal 
guidelines for this same purpose. Since the language before you in L.D. 1621 was 
originally recommended in early 2022, much work has occurred at the federal level to 
indicate that adopting these terms and definitions into Maine law now may complicate 
the Department's efforts to satisfy both state and federal requirements. 
In May 2022, EPA issued a 200-page guide on how environmental justice 
considerations could legally be applied to permitting decisions under federal 
environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act‘ . In that document, 
EPA uses the defined terms “meaningful involvement ” and “fair treatment" that must be 
provided to “undersen/ed communities" and “communities with environmental justice 
concerns. ” 
At the same time, EPA was developing guidance for states to administer grant funds as 
directed by President Biden’s Justice4O initiative, to ensure that at least 40% of federal 
funds go to “disadvantaged communities. ” For drinking water and wastewater funds,

“disadvantaged communities ” are identified by income, unemployment, and population 
trends. Then the 2022 inflation Reduction Act appropriated millions of dollars of federal 
funds to environmental programs to sen/e “low-income and disadvantaged 
communities," with criteria for identifying those communities to be determined by the 
EPA. 
In December 2022, the EPA published a proposed rule for implementing regulations 
under Clean Air Act Section 111(d)2 . in that rule, EPA proposed a definition of 
“meaningful engagement ” specifically for states’ implementation of certain emission 
standards. That proposed definition has elements similar to the definition proposed for 
“meaningful involvement ” in L.D. 1621, but yet the terms to be defined are slightly 
different with slightly different definitions. These are just a few examples of the 
differences between the content proposed in L.D. 1621 and the language that is 
evolving from EPA. 
The Department is committed to providing increased access to services, funding, and 
decision-making for low-income, undersen/ed, disadvantaged, and frontline 
communities. In collaboration with the EPA, the Department utilizes the Climate and 
Economic Justice Screening Tool to identify communities where additional effort should 
be made to provide grant funding, engage community members, increase compliance 
assurance with regulated facilities, and consider cumulative impacts of pollution in 
permitting and rule-making. However, the Department has received no additional 
funding for this work as EPA continues to add requirements for states to engage with 
these communities. Providing effective engagement opportunities for citizens in all 
parts of the state, on the wide variety of regulatory, permitting, and grant activities 
undertaken by the Department each year, will be costly. Section 2 of L.D. 1621 reflects

the Department ’s 2022 estimate of the costs to conduct public meetings for only1 
percent of permit applications3 , and is the minimum amount of resources the 
Department would request to fulfill the charge of L.D. 1621. 
The Department recommends amending Section 1 of the bill by removing the 
definitions, and removing paragraph 2(A). This would provide the Department with 
sufficient flexibility to align the proposed terminology in L.D. 1621 with federal 
requirements as they continue to evolve. 
We thank the sponsor for supporting the Department ’s environmental justice work, andl 
would be happy to answer any questions you have, now or at the work session. 
Thank you.
