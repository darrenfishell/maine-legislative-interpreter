LD 247
Dear Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee,
My name is Gina LeDuc-Kuntz. I am a resident of Freeport, Maine.
I object to today’s hearing in LD247 as the Maine State bill hearing calander only lists
this bill as a concept draft and this has not given the Public sufficient notice to 
formulate a well formed opinion on this bill’s merits. 
I request this Committee give the Public proper notice and restart the process.
Thank You,
Gina LeDuc-Kuntz
