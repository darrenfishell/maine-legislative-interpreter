LD 247
LD247 An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Elections, LINDA HASKELL
Testimony opposing an changes to the Maine Constitution on Laws Governing 
Elections. The fact that this LD247 was put on the site for a Public Hearing Friday 
April 28, 2023, with out any description of the Act in the contents of the Act, is 
disgusting and fraudulent. What is happening in the legislative division of the State of
Maine?!?
LINDA HASKELL, OPPOSES THIS ACT, LD247
