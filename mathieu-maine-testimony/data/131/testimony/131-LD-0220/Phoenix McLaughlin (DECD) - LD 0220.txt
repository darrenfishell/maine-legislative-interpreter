Dear Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry,  
 
The Department of Economic and Community Development has submitted a department bill, LD 
150, intended to allow  companies that have experienced catastrophes to be able to  maintain 
partici pation in the Pine Tree Development Zone and  food processing manufacturing facility credit 
programs.  This bill, An Act to Allow Incentive Continuity Following a Catastrophic Occurrence 
Under the Pine Tree Development Zone and Major Food Processing and Manufacturing Facility 
Expansion Tax Credit Programs , has been referred to the Committee on Innovation, Development, 
Economic Advancement  and Business.  Our understanding is that LD 220, An Act to Support 
Maine's Potato Farmers and Processor s, although still a concept draft, was submitted  and referred 
to your committee  with a similar intent.  
 
I am writing to ask if  your committee may consider delay ing action on LD 220 until the Committee 
on Innovation , Development, Economic Advancement  and B usiness has had the chance to work 
on LD 150. Doing so would give your two committees the chance to coordinate efforts to ensure 
the desired ends of these bills are achieved.  As a department, we intend  to make the required fixes 
to the relevant incentive statutes  through our bill, but we do not want to preclude the sponsors of 
LD 220 from pursuing further or different improvements through their bill.  
 
We are happy to discuss this issue further at your r equest.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Phoenix McLaughlin  
Tax Incentive Policy Manager
