RE: Neither for Nor Against testimony to the Rep. Guerrette  Amendment to LD 220, An Act to Support 
Maine’s Potato Farmers and Processors  
My name is Eric Venturini , and I am the Executive Director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine . I 
appreciate this opportunity to present you with additional information as you consider the amendment 
to LD 220, which was released yesterday.  
This amendment is meant to support Maine’s potato industry, in particular their need for sustainable 
water source development and irrigation. I do not question the Maine potato industry ’s need for this 
funding, or thei r struggl es with inflation, market pressures, labor challenges, and an ever -increasing risk 
of drought. Wild blueberry producers a re struggling to cope with the  very  same challenges, as are other 
agricultural sectors in Maine.  
The 2020 Maine Drought and Agriculture Report  
In 2021 , The University of Maine  published The 2020 Maine Drought and Agriculture Report.1 This report 
presents farmer surveys  (n=253)  that document the impact of the 2020 drought in Maine, using the five 
years prior to 2020 as baseline. The report includes respondents from across agricultural sectors and 
establishes that:  
• Over 50% of Maine farms did not ha ve sufficient water in 2020 . 
• All producer groups reported higher than normal losses in 2020, although more wild blueberry 
producers were impacted by drought than any other group and lost the greatest proportion of 
their crop to drought.  
•  
• 68.3% of respondents indicated that they intend to invest in irrigation in the near future, but 
more than half stated tha t they do not have the financial resources needed for those 
investments.

Irrigated Acreages  
There are an estimated 52,000 acres of potato2 and 42,000 acres of wild blueberry3 in Maine. Current 
estimates indicate that 25% of Maine’s potato acreage is irrigated, and we estimate that 35% of Maine’s 
42,000 acres of wild blueberry are irrigated. However, wild blueberries  and potatoes  are only a 
proportion  of the total cropland in Maine. Based on the most recent US agricultural census, Maine has 
472,508 total acres of cropland4 and considering the University of Maine’s published report from 2020, 
we know that irrigation is a need across agricultu ral sectors.  
Recommendation  
The need for sustainable water source development and irrigation extends across agricultural sectors, 
therefore I ask that if this committee plans to move forward with $3 million dollars for sustainable 
irrigation and wat er source development in potatoes, we ask you to consider:  
1. Allocating an additional $10 million to the Farmers Drought Relief Fund  to help meet the 
critical need for irrigation  for the rest of  Maine agriculture.5

5 The Farmers’  Drought Relief Fund was created through  LD 1998 in the 130th Session . The legislature funded this program 
through the Governor’s biennial budget this year as a $2 million in one -time investment , with an additional  $300,000 per year 
going forward .

220), then  the Farmers Drought Relief Fund  should be reserved for farmers of other produc ts. 
Thank you for your time  and for considering this additional information as you consider the amendment 
to LD 220. I would be happy to try and answer any questions that you may have today or in any future 
work sessions for this bill.
