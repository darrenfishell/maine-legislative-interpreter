Dear Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry ,  
 
LD 220, An Act to Support Maine's Potato Farmers and Processors , is a concept draft  that does not 
provide sufficient information for the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) 
to take a position on the bill before us today.  
 
Should the intent of this bill be to mirror  that of LD 150, An Act to Allow Incentive Continuity 
Following a Catastrophic Occurrence Under the Pine Tree Development Zone and Major Food 
Processing and Manufacturing Facility Expansion Tax Credit Programs  referred to the Committee on 
Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business , we can express our support for that 
bill and its intent  to ensure that companies participating in the Pine Tree Development Zo ne program 
are not punished in the event of a disaster. We, too, would favor changes that allowed for a baseline 
employment adjustment in the event of a catastrophic occurrence.  
 
In short, the Department recognizes the immense economic and social importance of potato grower s 
and the potato industry. We look forward to offering more feedback on LD 220 once details emerge.  
 
Sincerely , 
 
Craig Lapine, Director  
Maine Bureau of Agriculture, Food & Rural Resources
