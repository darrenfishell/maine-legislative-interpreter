LD 587
Personal needs allowance
Good afternoon senator Joseph Baldicci And represenative Mikchele Meyer and 
members of the Health acund Human Services Committe.
My name is Joel Packer and I am a volunteer for AARP Maine representing more 
than 230,000 members.  AARP is a non-profit, non-partison member organization 
representing the interest of Mainers age 50 and over and their families.
Medicaid allows a Personal Need Allowance or PNA since room and board and 
medical needs are covered by Medicaid.  The majority of one’s income must go 
towards the cost of nursing home care.  The PNA is intended to cover a resident’s 
personal expenses which are not covered by Medicaid.  Such costs may include, but 
are not limited to haircuts, vitamins, clothing, magazines, and vending machine 
snacks.   Inflation has taken a bite out of these personal items.  We need to help with 
keeping these allowances up to the Consumer Price Index.
L.D. 587 will automatically keep up to these increases.  Passing this bill will help to 
keep the residents’ dignity.  For example some residents up to now have not been able
to afford a gift to a grandchild or to provide themselves with items such as Fixodent 
in order to wear dentures.
AARP Maine Supports L.D.587 and I ask for your support
