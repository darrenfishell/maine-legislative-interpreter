TESTIMONY 
In Support of 
LD 587: Resolve, to Automatically Increase a Residential Care or Nursing Facility 
Resident's Personal Needs Allowance Under the MaineCare Program When the Consumer 
Price Index Increases 
March 22,2023 
Maine Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services. 
My name is Laura Harper. I am a Senior Associate at Moose Ridge Associates. I am here today 
on behalf of the Maine Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program. The Ombudsman Program isa 
state-wide non-proﬁt organization that provides advocacy for older adults and adults with 
disabilities who receive long-term services and supports across the state. The program serves 
residents in nursing homes, residential care, assisted living facilities, adult day programs and 
recipients of home care services. Additionally, we serve patients in hospitals who experience 
barriers in accessing long-term care services when they are ready for discharge. 
This legislation requires the Department of Health and Human Services, by July 1, 2024, to 
amend the rules for the MaineCare program to apply an annual cost-of-living increase to the 
personal needs allowance for MaineCare members residing in nursing homes and residential care 
facilities. The cost-of-living increase applies the metrics used by the Consumer Price Index for 
Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for the Northeast Region. 
The personal needs allowance (PNA) is the monthly amount of money that residents who receive 
MaineCare may retain from their personal income. Any income above the allowance is applied 
toward the cost of their care. The PNA is provided so that residents will have funds to pay for 
expenses such as magazines, cards, a meal out with friends/family, haircuts, hobbies, clothing,
telephone, cable television, etc. Items such as toothpaste, tissues, shampoo, and incontinence 
products are paid for by MaineCare. Federal regulations prohibit nursing homes from charging 
residents ’ PNA for items that are provided for by MaineCare payments while state regulations 
provide the same protection for residents of residential care facilities. 
Maine’s personal needs allowances have not been raised in many years. The American Council 
on Aging, February 2023 indicates that Maine’s nursing home PNA of $40 is the lowest in New 
England. Currently the other New England States provide the following amounts: CT $75 MA 
$72.80, NH $74.00, RI $50, VT $72.66. (see attached chart) 
The adequacy of the PNA is important to the quality of life of residents in both nursing homes 
and residential care facilities allowing them the ability to meet some very basic needs that are not 
provided for by MaineCare. Additionally, applying an annual cost- of -living increase proposed 
in this bill is a reasonable approach to increasing the PNA. 
Thank you for your consideration.
