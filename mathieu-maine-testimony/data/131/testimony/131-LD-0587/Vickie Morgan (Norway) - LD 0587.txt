Good Afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and esteemed 
members of the Health and Human Services Committee,
My name is Vickie Morgan, I am a resident of Norway, and I am here today 
to testify in favor of LD 587 “A Resolve, to Automatically Increase a 
Residential Care or Nursing Facility Resident's Personal Needs 
Allowance Under the MaineCare Program When the Consumer Price 
Index Increases”.
Currently, the Personal Needs Allowance is only $70.00. This has been the 
same for decades. As we all know, prices have steadily increased over the 
years and even The Dollar Tree has increased their price from $1.00 to 
$1.25. This has to cover the cost of personal care items, clothing, internet 
(if not provided), and other miscellaneous items.
An increase in this allowance would give resident's some of their dignity 
and autonomy back. They would not have to choose between personal 
hygiene, a new winter coat, a birthday card for a family member or friend. 
All persons deserve to have these items to not only survive, but to thrive.
In closing, I urge you to pass LD 587.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Vickie Morgan
