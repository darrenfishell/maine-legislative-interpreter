Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1744:
“An
Act
to
Strengthen
Accountability
in
Rulemaking
by
Providing
for
Legislative
Oversight”
Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
State
and
Local
Government,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1744
.
This
bill
would
establish
a
joint
committee
to
review
administrative
rules.
It
would
also
establish
a
Legislative
Economic
Analysis
Unit,
headed
by
a
chief
economist,
to
provide
an
unbiased
report
on
the
economic
impact
of
potential
or
existing
agency
rules.
Both
of
these
offices
are
much-needed
in
Maine’s
government,
given
the
vast
costs
imposed
by
the
regulatory
state.
This
bill
is
necessary
because
the
administrative
state
is
out
of
control,
certainly
at
the
federal
level,
but
also
within
the
Maine
state
government.
The
growth
of
the
power
of
executive
branch
agencies
to
draft,
adopt,
and
enforce
legislation
has
wrought
drastic
economic
costs.
An
analysis
of
the
2018
Code
of
Maine
Rules
(CMR)
found
that
it
contains
113,862
regulatory
restrictions
and
8.1
million
words.
Author
James
Broughel
noted
that
“it
would
take
an
individual
about
449
hours
–
or
more
than
11
weeks
–
to
read
the
entire
2018
CMR,
assuming
the
reader
spends
40
hours
per
week
reading
at
a
rate
of
300
words
per
minute.”

These
regulations
are
not
empty
words;
each
is
backed
by
the
force
of
law,
bearing
costs
for
those
tasked
with
complying
with
them.
And
since
they
are
promulgated
by
the
agencies
who
enforce
them,
Maine
business
owners
are
left
to
the
whim
of
bureaucrats
who,
while
constantly
changing
the
rules,
make
it
nearly
impossible
to
follow
them.
Please
deem
LD
1744
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
restore
a
proper
role
for
the
executive
branch,
one
which
merely
enforces
laws
passed
by
the
legislature,
not
one
which
gets
to
stake
out
the
limits
of
its
own
power
to
the
detriment
of
Maine
people
and
industry.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
