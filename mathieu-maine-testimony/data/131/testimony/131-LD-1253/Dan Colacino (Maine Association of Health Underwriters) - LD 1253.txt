RE:  LD #  1253 
_____________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
On behalf of the Maine Association of Health Underwriters (MaineAHU), I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to submit comments on the proposed bill. 
 MaineAHU is a state chapter of the National Association of Health Underwriters and represents licensed 
agents, brokers, and employee benefit consultants who sell and service individual and group health, 
disability, Medicare, and long-term care insurance. 
We are writing in regard to our support for  LD 1253. 
We had opposed the merger of the two markets when the proposal was first raised in the last session.  
The pools differ in their demographic makeup and claims experience to the extent that the group 
market was going to be negatively impacted. The actuarial studies from the Bureau confirmed this.  The 
only factor that helped the group market was using funds from the Individual market to subsidize high 

cost claimants in the group market. This obviously negatively impacted the individual market, another 
fact that came out from the actuarial studies.   
We realize the purpose of the merger was to address the declining size of the respective markets and a 
merger was one of the solutions.  The declining markets are a real concern but there may be other ways 
to address this.  The reduction of the Medicaid market which comes with the end of the pandemic rule 
and the unwinding of the continuous enrollment requirement will have an impact on the size of the 
individual market.  What impact this will have is a bit of an unknown so we suggest that the bill be 
amended to allow for a later date for dissolving the merged markets.  In the meantime, we suggest that 
the Bureau investigate other options for the small group market such as we recommended in our earlier 
testimony in 2019.  Raising the small group size from 50 to 100, as other States have done, is a 
reasonable alternative to investigate. This will add a significant number of members to the small group 
market and a population which tends to have better claims experience as weâ€™ve seen in other States 
such as NYS. 
We would like to thank the Committee for considering our comments and the opportunity to express 
our views. If you have questions, please feel free to contact me. 
 
Respectfully, 
 
 
Dan Colacino 
Vice President
