Testimony of Dan Demeritt — 4/20/23 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
In Support of LD 1253 
An Act to Maintain the Integrity of the Individual and Small Group Health Insurance Markets 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Demeritt, the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, 
Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and United Health Care. Our private 
and non-proﬁt insurance carriers provide or administer health insurance coverage to about 
600,000 Maine people. Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people 
by promoting affordable, safe, and coordinated healthcare. 
Maine Association of Health Plans members have consistently raised concerns and voiced 
opposition to efforts to achieve short-term savings in small group premiums at the expense of the 
individual market and the long-tenn viability of Maine Guaranteed Access Reinsurance 
Association (MGARA) and the program’s impact on those premiums. ‘ 
Since resuming operations in 2019, the MGARA program has lowered premiums for individual 
market enrollees.2 3 
The merger of Maine’s small group and individual markets signiﬁcantly 
dilutes the program’s impact by extending its coverage to a larger pool without any additional 
funding. 
The underlining challenges in Maine’s healthcare system have not changed due to the merger of 
the individual and small-group markets. In a few plan years, changes made to MGARA fora 
one-time impact on small-group premiums will erode the program's viability as a tool to manage 
risk and maintain affordability in individual and small group markets. 
However, if the bill advances as written, it could create confusion in the marketplace. The 
committee should consider bringing stakeholders together to develop a proposal for unwinding 
the merger of Maine’s individual and small group markets. We would be happy to participate.
