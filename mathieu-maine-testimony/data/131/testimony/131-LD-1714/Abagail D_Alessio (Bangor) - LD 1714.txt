Re Passage of LD 1714 
Dear Senator Grohosk|, Representative Periy, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation 
My name is Abagail D'AIessio I am a person in recovery I'm writing today as a community of 
maine I became more involved with becoming a volunteer at the Bangor Area Recovery 
Network Center In a time of losing my mother to covid 19 and a month later father figure toa 
heart attack I started drinking more often and more than usaul for myself many things came to 
light in my journey of several trauma and pain, I held shame and guilt during a time of griefI 
knew I was dying inside spiritually and physically I knew I couldn't do this on my own, with 
insight of how this disease is bafﬂing and will attack silently and boldly I chose to reach to the 
BARN See for many years I had been through the doors as I work in the field of substance use 
disorder with work, clients, friends and family 
I was open about my current situation and was told by a staff, I had something to give back still 
and now,in my dark moment I started volunteering something I had not done before at the 
center I sen/ed other I listened to members They expressed their fears, vulnerability and 
transparency with the abilities to share their darkest deepest challenges I listened as I felt 
ovenivhelmingly moved in my heart by also the strength, hope, and brave speaking honestly 
about their challenges and addictions At first I thought I would never sit in the chair to tell my 
story Shortly I found myself wanting nothing more to be a part of claiming my own seat and 
become a active member of a movement to tell on my disease and accept myself and heal 
This is why I'm in support of LD1714 The Recovery Center in my area changed my inner spirit 
and outer person, it gave hopel It changed my life for the better and gave me the support I 
needed more deeply than I ever thought I am more than thankful for staff of current growing 
programs The staff at the center and volunteers that strive all together as one to overcome and 
break stigma of shame and guilt
\ The BARN has given m and provides an atmosphere of acceptance and oven/vhelming kindness 
with healing l was able to meet old allies and new friends It helped me give back when I feltl 
had failed our community and myself 
This is why passing LD 1714 to use tax dollars in this way is so important Recovery centers in 
our state ]0ll"l in a important rising community of people that are smart, talented and fearless on 
their part of challenges of past consequences of current life events They make room for love, 
purpose and inclusiveness lt brings families back together They bring children home to parents 
arms,parents back to raise and care for their children and it keeps people knowing, they are 
safe There is hope of change With the current substance use crisis,unnecessary overdose 
deaths and moving fast isolation crisis that is killing loved ones to all of us 
It doesn't matter if one has used / drank that day and or involved their circumstance in illegal 
actively No matter if some one has 40 years of every day walking into the walls We all share 
love and acceptance, perseverance We embrace each other with open arms tight hugs and 
respect to each other of jUS1I making it for today through the doors or calling for support We are 
all the same people in recovery People with substance use disorder reach within themselves to 
make a difference and be accountable for self and others 
Our State of Maine has more demand than resources available to meet these needs I have 
watched and heard the cries of fellow people be in need of the kind of love that is provided with 
many communiues across Maine l have lost friends and family to death to early from this fight 
We don't have enough in areas to support the needs with non discrimination of people that 
need love right where they are in their own pathway of recovery 
The recovery centers and more to come to open with this funding will help throughout our 
wonderful state as mainers will contribute to the success of growing employment, careers and 
volunteering options to give back and get over the straight survival of secondaiy infections of 
trauma effects People desperately will push through dual diagnosis that is overcome by 
recovery centers be in place Without funding we are killing slowly and fast mainers 
With funding will support the sustainable efforts that keeps lights and doors and ability to have 
opened center The funding will be used for the need of staff, needs of growing programs and 
need of reporting, data, and successful stories, with empowering lives to make this happen 
We Recover, We are important and We Matter 
Thank you in advance for allowing me to speak and consideration, support in this way for our 
community and the ability to use funds available in a amazing way moving fon/vard

Warmly, 
Abagail D'Alessio
