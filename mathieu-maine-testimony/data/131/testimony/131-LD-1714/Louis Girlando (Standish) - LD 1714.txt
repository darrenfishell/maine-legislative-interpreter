RE LD 1714 
05/8/2023 
Good mornrng Senator Grohoskr, Representatrve Perry, and esteemed members of the Taxatron 
Commrttee My name rs Lours Grrlando I lrve 1n Standrsh I am a volunteer at the Portland Recovery 
Commumty Center I am testrfyrng 1n support of LD 1714 and apprecrate the chance to provrde testrmony 
regardrng thrs matter 
W1th 716 overdose deaths and over 10,000 total overdoses last year the oprord eprdemrc rs the worst rt has 
ever been People are lookrng for help and can’t get rt fast enough For the last 6 months I worked asa 
volunteer at a recovery center, I keep hearrng the same stones over and over agarn “I need help, I needa 
place to stay, I don’t know what to do ” Current med1cal servrces are not enough, people are on the 
wartlrst for months, sent away, and have to ﬁnd other ways to heal Recovery Centers become a l1fel1ne to 
those sufferrng No one wants to be on the street, overdosed, and hurtrng 
Whrle many of us are fortunate to have help and support, such as msurance and housrng, many do not 
Recovery Centers become havens for those strugglrng, I myself suffered from severe depressron and 
substance abuse I was contemplatrng surcrde because I was alone I was on the wartlrst for psych 
ass1stance for a year The recovery center provrded help I needed untrl I could recerve proper psych careI 
was lucky though, many are not 
Increased fundrng wrll lead to a charn reactron of a long-term sustarnabrlrty of Ma1ne’s stretched 
healthcare Thrs year, the PRCC got over 1000 new members, many who are trymg to avord overdose 
Recovery centers are growrng and need more fundrng Comparatrvely, the average cost of takrng care of 
an overdosed patrent 1s nearly $12000, multrplyrng that by 10,000 overdoses per year rounds out to 
costrng $120,000,000 a year If thrs act passes, even 1f we save _]U.S1I 10% of patrents that would otherwrse 
overdose, that rs $12,000,000 saved rn med1cal funds 
I understand there may be reservatrons on where to allocate such funds, however I ask you to thrnk about 
the current state of Marne rrght now, we are a house on ﬁre rrght now, yes, there may be a leaky roof, but 
that pales 1n comparrson to the burmng burldrng Thrs act would help 1n both the short and long tenn of 
Marne 
Our state slogan 1s “The way lrfe should be” , We need to lrve up to that I urge you to vote 1n favor of LD 
1 71 4, 
Thank you for your trme
