RE: LD 1714 
  
I am writing about the need for support of our local recovery centers. We need LD1714 to help support 
our recovery center, Larry Labonte Recovery Center, and the recoveries they support. 
 I am in recovery; I started this journey about 10 months ago.  When I decided I wanted to be clean and 
sober I needed to reach out for help.  That help came from resources at our local recovery center and 
individuals who were involved in the recovery.  The help came in the form of meetings and recovery 
coaching, it changed my life. I was fortunate, but not everyone is.  There is not enough meetings and 
coaching available for all who need it.  The Larry Labonte Recovery Center does a great job, but only can 
do so much with limited funding.  If we can get more funding and support for these centers, I believe we 
can help many, many more people.  These centers can save lives, I feel I am proof of that, and thankful I 
was able to get the help I needed. 
  
Sincerely, 
Seth Fournier
