Re Passage of LD 1714 
Dear Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation 
As a recovery ally, I have personally witnessed the importance of recovery community centers in 
my area 
One of the biggest reasons people turn to substances, to begin with, and one of the biggest 
stumbling blocks to recovery is social isolation and alienation Recovery community centers, like 
the Bangor Area Recovery Network, help people overcome that isolation by offering people the 
opportunity to engage and be part of communities Enabling them to develop social networks 
and support networks 
I have personally seen this firsthand with my friends at the Bangor Area Recovery Network It 
has also touched my life personally, being a venue where I, as an ally, have been able to find 
friends, support, and community Through a community garden project, I was a part of, I've seen 
people learn and grow and make major strides forward in their recovery journey 
Additionally, recovery community centers can play an important role in reducing stigma and 
discrimination around addiction and mental health issues By providing a safe and welcoming 
space for individuals in recovery, these centers can help to raise awareness about the 
challenges faced by people in recovery and promote a more understanding and supportive 
community As an autistic person myself, I have found a community at the BARN that IS 
understanding and accepting of me I am proud to say I've spent my last Thanksgiving and was 
able to cheer on the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl with my friends at the Bangor Area 
Recovery Network 
Ultimately RCCs are cornerstones for our communities
