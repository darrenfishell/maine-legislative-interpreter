RE: LD 1714 
 
To: Senate Chair Nicole Grohoski, House Chair Joseph Perry and esteemed members of the 
Committee on Taxation:  
 
My name is Bruce Campbell, and I am a man in recovery.  I serve as Chair of the Maine 
Substance Use Disorders Services Commission (SUDSC), but I am submitting this as a proud 
citizen of Maine and a long-term recovery advocate.  I am asking you to support LD 1714, An 
Act to Create a Sustainable Funding Source for Recovery Community Centers Using a 
Percentage of the Adult Use Cannabis Tax Revenue.”  
 
Recovery community centers (RCCs) are population-based and provide recovery support to an 
entire community.  Over the past five years, Maine has seen the power of the recovery 
community and our recovery community centers have swelled to 19 throughout the State. There 
is a commitment to have at least one RCC in every County in Maine, but there is no discernible 
funding stream to sustain that commitment. 
 
These peer-run centers provide meaningful volunteer opportunities for people in recovery, and 
this support becomes self-generating. Maine’s RCCs can generate up to 1,000 volunteer hours 
per month, a tremendous return on investment, but none of this would happen without the basic 
support each center needs.  
 
Using revenues generated from adult use cannabis taxes, LD 1714 will provide a visible 
resource by establishing the Recovery Community Center Fund. I strongly urge your support 
to pass LD 1714 for sustainable recovery resources in the State of Maine.  
 
Sincerely submitted, 
 
Bruce Campbell, LCSW, LADC
