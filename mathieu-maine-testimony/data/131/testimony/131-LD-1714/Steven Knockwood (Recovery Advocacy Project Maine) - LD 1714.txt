Greetlngs SenatorGrobosk1, Representauve Peny and other honorable members of the Jomt 
Standmg Comtmttee of Taxat1on, My name 1s Steven Knockwood I am the Deputy Orgamz1ng 
D1rector for the Mame Recovery Advocacy Pro] ect (ME-RAP) I stand before you today to glve 
testlmony m favor of LD 1714 An Act To Create a Sustamable Fundmg Source for Recovery 
Commumty Centers 
It 1s w1dely accepted by many cultures and soc1et1es of past and present that no course of actlon 1s 
1nherently only good or bad In short, all thmgs are both If we as a collectlve can agree wrth th1s asa 
natural law that apphes to all thmgs, we are already halfway there 
Some 1nd1v1dua1s who choose to use cannabrs recreat1ona11y W111 1n fact develop Cannabls Use D1sorder 
(CUD) Recovery Centers have proven to be the best place for mdrvrduals seekmg serv1ces and support to 
ﬁnd them and connect w1th others who can ldentlfy w1th them 
Currently there 1s no long tenn plan to sustam those that have opened wlthm our state Most do not have 
budgets large enough to serve the populat1ons they are expected to It 1s tlme for our State to step up and 
glve these places the ab1l1ty to nnprove on servlces and supports, expand hours to better serve and to 
overcome barners often faced when these are 1n rural areas 
The State of Mame collects revenue from the sales and exclse tax pa1d by the 1nd1v1duals who choose to 
use cam1ab1s m our state Currently 12% of what 1s collected 1s used to a1d preventlon and a1d educat1on 
efforts concemmg pollce Upstream and downstream from where the money from LD 1714 W111 be v1taly 
spent If slgned mto law We as a soclety need to ensure that Recovery Centers are avallable and well 
funded for all people to utlhze for recovery servlces The people workrng as peer supports and recovery 
coaches are makmg l1vable wages where currently most pos1t1ons due to fundmg are volunteer based 
These tramed 1nd1v1dua1s who often pull from the1r own 11ved 11fe expenences and trauma deserve to be 
compensated an amount reﬂectlve of the amazmg work they do 
The most nnportant thmg I feel I can tell you 1s some of my expenence concem1ng the Recovery Centers 
March 15th 2020 I was released from mcarceratlon 1nto the Bangor Recovery Commumty What’s so 
speclal about that date 1s 1t was two days before our world as we knew 1t changed, Covld beganI 
remember the panlc of 1solat1on felt by our commumty, I speclﬁcally remember hearmg of the BARN 
closmg lts doors When th1s happened we lost people to recurrence of dlsease on a dally basls, we also 
lost many to su1c1de ﬁ'om the stressors of th1s 1solat1on I beheve 1t was th1s set of events that proved Just 
how v1tal Recovery Centers are to mdlvlduals who have Substance Use D1sorder and are trymg to recover 
We can not afford to lose any of our exrstmg Recovery Centers, we must contmue to mcrease the number 
of Centers and we need to lmprove on how the servlces 1n these centers are provlded
