Testimony in‘ 
Support of LD1714 
Hello, Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Taxation, my 
name is Glenn, I am a resident of Mexico, ME I am here to testify on behalf of LD 1714 An Act 
to Create a Sustainable Funding Source for Recovery Community Centers Using a Percentage of 
the Adult Use Cannabis Tax Revenue 
I am Certiﬁed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (CADC) and the Overdose Prevention Through 
Intensive Outreach Naloxone and Safety (OPTIONS) Liaison for Oxford County. 
The Recovery Centers in Oxford County provide a critical entry point for someone seeking 
services They provide a low barner, supportive enviromnent that 1S conﬁdential and non- 
threatening for someone seeking information, resources, recovery coaching and connection with 
a community of people recovering 
While providing critical supports for people and affected others suffermg from substance use, 
Recovery Centers unfortunately are frequently in a state of hustling to ﬁnd the financial means to 
pay keep their doors open, pay their utilities, their staff and sustain programming. This means 
frequently managers and staff are spending precious time and creative energy fundraising, that 
could be used to work with individuals, educate the public and increase programming 
As the OPTIONS Liaison for Oxford County, the Larry Labonte Recovery Center and the 
HILLS Recovery Center play an important role in providing cormection for individuals, friends 
and families affected by substance use disorder They are a precious resource that provide 
community which is the cure for this deadly epidemic 
That is why I support LD17l4 
Respectfully, 
Glerm Gordon
