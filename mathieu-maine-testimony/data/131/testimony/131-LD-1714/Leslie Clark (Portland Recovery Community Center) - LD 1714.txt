Senator Grohoskl, Representat1ve Perry, and honorable members of the J o1nt Standmg Commlttee on 
Taxatlon 
My name 1s Leshe Clark I am a person 1n long-tenn recovery from alcohol and drugs and serve as the 
Executlve D1rector of Portland Recovery Commun1ty Center (PRCC ) I am testlfymg today 1n favor of 
LD 1714 Recovery Commun1ty Centers play a v1ta1 role 1n help1ng people ﬁnd and reta1n long-tenn 
recovery from add1ct1on The need has never been greater to prov1de th1s 1mportant resource 1n every 
c0mmun1ty 1n Mame, and yet the fundmg streams are l1m1ted Th1s b11l w1ll prov1de an addltlonal ﬁ.1nd1ng 
stream that comes dlrectly from the recreat1onal sales of cannab1s It 1s estlmated that as many as 40% of 
people who use cannabls W111 become addlcted, especlally 1f they are under 25 years old Assunng that 
adequate resources are 1n place to help people who struggle w1th add1ct1on 1s essent1al 
I have been a person 1n recovery slnce 1989 When I ﬁrst came 1nto recovery, as a professlonal anda 
leader of a prestlglous nonproﬁt 1n Aust1n there were few places to ﬁnd help and safeguard conﬁdent1al1ty 
to protect agamst stlgma Long-term recovery 1s hard (1f not 1mposs1b1e) for most people to sustam unless 
they are connected to a commun1ty of others who have themselves recovered and can offer support and 
hope Today recovery commun1ty centers offer more opt1ons to more people and have proven to bea 
h1ghly effect1ve part of the solut1on to the nat1on’s drug and alcohol cr1s1s, offenng low-cost and 
access1ble cho1ces for people to get help and recover 
Portland Recovery Commun1ty Center opened 1ts doors 1n 2012, a t1me when we were one of the two 
recovery commumty centers 1n Mame Today, PRCC serves as the hub of the network of recovery 
commun1ty centers across Ma1ne After York County opens 1ts ﬁrst center th1s July, there w1ll be 20 
recovery cormnumty centers statew1de But many of these centers struggle to keep the1r doors open and 
create a sustamable organ1zat1on due to lack of adequate fund1ng 
Recovery Commun1ty Centers (RCCs) are organ1zat1ons led and governed by representat1ves of local 
recovery commun1t1es w1th a prlmary focus on recovery from substance use d1sorder that prov1des 
noncl1n1ca1, peer recovery suppo1t serv1ces such as recovery support groups, recovery coach1ng, telephone 
recovery support, sk1ll-bu1ld1ng groups, harm reduct10n act1v1t1es, recovery-focused outreach programs to 
engage people seekmg or 1n recovery and recovery-focused pol1cy and advocacy act1v1t1es RCC’s have 
been demonstrated to help people ma1nta1n long tenn recovery, bu1ld recovery capltal, and lmprove 
quallty of l1fe (Recovery Research Instztute)

Researchers from the Recovery Research Instltute have afﬁrmed what we have known to be true The1r 
studres have 1nd1cated that RCC part1c1pat1on 1s 11nked to lncreased abstmence, lowered substance-related 
harms, and 1ncreased psychologlcal well-berng Furthermore, 1t takes 15 years for the average recovenng 
U S person to reach the same quahty of l1fe and functlomng as someone 1n the general populatron 
However, 1nd1v1dua1s rece1v1ng peer support S6I'V1C6S through RCCs are able to reach the same quahty of 
l1fe as someone 1n the general populatron 1n _]1lS1I ﬁve years 
Investlng 1n recovery support servrces reduces the socretal costs of SUD A study 1n 2021, estlmated the 
rmpact of the op1o1d ep1dem1c 1n Mame to be $6 8 b11l1on 1n 2017 or $5,099 per Marner, the srxth hrghest 
per caprta cost 1n the US (Luo et al 2021) RCC attendance 1s l1nked to enhanced rncome, employment, 
and well-berng Furthermore, expandrng recovery support servrces rncreases the econom1c successes long- 
term recovery brmgs to Marne Accordmg to the Natlonal Safety Councll, employers stand to save an 
average of $8,500 per employee 1n recovery from a SUD 
If passed, LD 1714 W1llpI‘0V1(l6 an add1t1onal and steady fundrng stream for Mame RCCs to operate and 
meet the d1re need for recovery support servrces 1n Ma1ne’s commun1t1es It 1s only fa1r and reasonable 
that the proﬁt from the sales of cannabrs support help support a network of recovery supports 1n every 
communlty for 1nd1viduals and fam1l1es When I ﬁrst came 1nto recovery, the drugs of my generatron, 
wh1le dangerous, were not as lethal nor were they as prevalent Mame has done an except1onal ]Ob of 
bu1ld1ng recovery resources, but more are needed 1f we are to stop the t1de of add1ct1on and offer peoplea 
way to recover I am deeply grateful to be a person 1n recovery and to be 1n a pos1t1on to help others ﬁnd 
the1r way to freedom from the ravages of add1ct1on Recovery 1s possrble At PRCC and throughout 
Marne we see 1nd1v1dua1s rebu11dthe1rl1ves, we see fam111es reumted, we see employees re]o1n the 
workforce, and we see how communrtles beneﬁt from lnvestments 1n recovery I urge th1s commlttee to 
vote 1n favor of LD 1719 
I thank the Commrttee for takmg the trme to l1sten to my testlmony, and I am happy to answer any 
questrons that the Commlttee may have 
Smcerely,
