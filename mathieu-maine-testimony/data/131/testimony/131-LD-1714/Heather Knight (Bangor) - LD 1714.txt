Re: Passage of LD 1714 
 
Dear Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Taxation: 
 
My name is Heather Knight, and I am a Woman in Longterm Recovery.  I have struggled 
for a majority of my life being addicted to different things.  In 2013, my Substance Abuse 
started to take a hold of my life, and had me prisoner.  Coming into Recovery literally 
saved my life.  
 
Having a recovery center available like the Bangor Area Recovery Network has been life 
changing for me.  I had a safe place to go and interact with people who felt the way that I 
did.  I no longer felt alone, and didn’t want to isolate.  I finally felt at “Home” for the first 
time in a long time. The volunteers and staff at the BARN are always willing to lend an 
ear, lend a hand or just willing to sit and hold space with you.   
 
Recovery centers like the Barn not only provide meetings, but there is always something 
going on that will help give individuals the opportunity to get connected with others.  
Addiction is a very lonely disease and want to keep us alone.  When we come together 
we are to come together and combat this together and the Barn is a place that assists with 
that.   
 
I feel that passing LD 1714 is very important.  With the current substance use crisis, the 
need for recovery resources has more demand than the resources available. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
Heather A. Knight
