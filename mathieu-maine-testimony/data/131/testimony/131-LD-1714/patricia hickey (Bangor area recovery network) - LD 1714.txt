I am writing in support of recovery center funding.  I am a woman in long term 
recovery and was chair of the SASC under Governor Baldacci.  I was involved in the 
beginning of the opiod crisis and witnessed first hand the devastation to families 
communities and the state.  We were helpless, hopeless and lost.  It was a a secret.  
we were not  "those people" we were shamed and floundering as our children died.  
Recovery centers are bastions of hope.  i have been involved in our recovery center 
since its inception.  I have witnessed miracles.  People come here looking for help, 
inclusion, acceptance and hope.  We provide all of this and more.  Please visit a 
recovery center for yourself.  It is a matter of life and death.  Truly
