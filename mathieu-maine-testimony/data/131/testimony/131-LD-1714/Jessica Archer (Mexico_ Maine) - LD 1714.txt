My Name is Jessica Archer and I work at the Larry Labonte Recovery Center in Rumford, ME. I’m writing 
this in reference to the LD1714 Bill. This bill is extremely important to not only the recovery centers but 
our State as a whole. 
It’s very apparent there is a huge problem with substance abuse disorders everywhere and it doesn’t 
just affect the people who use it, this is an issue that affects everyone. 
I suffer with SUD and mental illness myself, I've been in recovery for almost 5 years. Working at a 
Recovery Center for the last almost 2 years has taught me so much about myself, and the SUD 
community. 
We have come such a long way as a state with this issue, but we still have so much more work that 
needs to be done. This bill could help communities build sober houses, rehabs, and detox centers and 
share the education that is greatly needed. It could help in so many ways to better our community’s 
future. 
I do appreciate this bill going in for discussion but personally I think this should be a given. 
Thank you,
