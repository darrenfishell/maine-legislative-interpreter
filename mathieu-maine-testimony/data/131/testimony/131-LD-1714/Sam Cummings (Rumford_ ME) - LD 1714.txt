To the Legislatures:  
 
 I believe that passing this bill would be beneficial for the recovery 
community as well as those who are still struggling. I know from my personal 
experience, I would not be where I am in my recovery if it wasn’t for the availability 
of Recovery Community Centers. I have utilized RCC’s in many capacities, both in 
Portland and in Rumford. I have used them to have help with being connected and 
admitted into a detox center when I was still actively using and searching for a way 
out of the lifestyle I was living. I have also used them for connection with other 
people who were actively seeking recovery through 12-Step meetings. I have also 
used RCC’s as a place of employment, which without that opportunity I truly believe 
I would not have been successful as I have been in my recovery journey thus far. 
This employment opportunity has given me the chance to be a productive member 
of society by providing me the resources to be trained as a Recovery Coach. This 
certification allows me to be able to give back to the community. Lastly, I have been 
able to utilize RCC’s as a way to reach other people in recovery and those who are 
still struggling by starting an awareness project called “Faces of Recovery” which 
calls attention to individuals who have found recovery and are living happy healthy 
lives. I feel that by passing this bill and providing funding for RCC’s around the state 
is of underestimated importance in assisting individuals through the struggle of 
addiction.
