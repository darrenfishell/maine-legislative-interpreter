Re Passage of LD 1714 
Dear Senator Grohosk|, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Taxation 
My name is Troy Hood I am a volunteer at the Bangor Area Recovery Network Something I have realized 
since coming to the BARN is that the BARN helps people stay off the streets and out of trouble They 
have an amazing support system The minute I walked in I was treated like family They have provided a 
lot of special events for volunteers and the community as well as outreach programs My family has been 
going through a lot and we needed help We went everywhere asking for help picking up a bed and the 
BARN and the volunteers were happy to transport the bed for us on a Sunday afternoon If I didn't have 
the BARN, I don't know where I would be This past week I went bowling for the ﬁrst time in my life it 
was an amazing time This community recovery center has helped me with my math skills, my social 
skills, and my confidence 
Since coming to the BARN, I have obtained a Recovery Coach and he helps me when I need someone to 
talk to He helps me ﬁnd recovery meeﬁngs He goes with me to meetings when I'm too nervous to go by 
myself and he sﬁcks by my side no matter what The BARN is willing to help anyone who walks through 
the doors The BARN doesn’t jUS'lI help people with substance use disorder they help anyone who needs 
it The BARN staff and volunteers don't judge people, they welcome them 
I believe it IS important to fund recovery centers because people need places to make friends and ﬁnd 
resources 
Sincerely, 
Troy Hood
