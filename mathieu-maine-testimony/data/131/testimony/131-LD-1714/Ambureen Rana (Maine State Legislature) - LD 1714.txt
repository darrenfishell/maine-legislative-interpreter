Testimony of Representatzve Ambureen Rana sponsoring 
LD 1714, An Act to Create a Sustainable Funding Source for Recovery 
Community Centers Using a Percentage of the Adult Use Cannabis Tax 
Revenue 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Good afternoon, Senator Grohoski, Representative Pen'y and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Taxation My name 1S Ambureen Rana, and I represent House District 
21, which includes a portion of Bangor I am here before you today to present LD 1714, An Act 
to Create a Sustainable Funding Source for Recovery Community Centers Usinga 
Percentage of the Adult Use Cannabis Tax Revenue. 
I want to begin by thanking the Mills’ Administration for their dedication to recovery community 
centers Under Governor Mills’ leadership, these centers have become a beacon of hope in 12 
counties m Maine, with plans to expand to every county in the near future And while we are 
grateful to Governor Mills for her dedication, we are also worried that these centers cinrently 
have no sustainable fundmg source and that many of them are operating on “shoestring budgets 
and hopes and dreams,” with ﬁve of the centers currently only receiving $50,000 a year from 
DHHS as start-up fundmg with no plans about what happens when that funding runs out 
Pr2Peer, located in my home of Penobscot County, 1S one of these centers In written testimony 
from board member Frank Clukey, the $50,000 contract with DHHS currently helps to cover the 
mortgage of the center, electric, oil, winter plowing expenses, insurances, ofﬁce supplies, coffee, 
meeting expenses, cormnunity programmmg such as paint night, and grab-and-go meals 
Pir2Peer also provides help with transportation to and from the center so no one is left without 
recovery support m a rural Maine community, such as Medway This center struggles to meet 
their fmancial obligations each month and worries about when a pipe will burst (which it did this 
winter) and how they will ﬁnd the extra $1,000 to cover the insurance deductible

I 
Readmg th1s testrmony, I struggled to understand how they are keep1ng the center gomg Who 1s 
opemng the center's door for meetmgs, dnvmg to get people, and makmg the meals they 
prov1de‘7 How are they paymg the1r staff? Is 1t completely run by volunteers ‘? I don’t know the 
answers to these questlons, but I do know that a center provrdmg such v1tal servlces to our 
commumty should not be operatlng on hopes and dreams 
As the t1tle suggests, LD 1714 seeks to create a sustamable fundmg source for centers l1ke 
P1r2Peer by creatlng the Recovery Commumty Centers Fund at the Department of Health and 
Human Servrces, Wl'l1Cl'1 W111 be funded us1ng 12% of the tax revenue collected on the sale of 
adult-use cam1ab1s Based on Mame Adult Use Cannabls tax revenues from 2022, th1s b11l could 
provlde approxrmately $3 28 m1ll1on a year to the Recovery Commun1ty Centers Fund 
Furthermore, t11e b1l1 does not take away from the Adult Use Carmabls Pllbl1C Health and Safety 
Fund - whlch from my understandlng 1s currently fundlng preventlon PR campalgns and 
educatlon to law enforcement However, 1t does clanfy that 12% of the sales tax revenue 
collected on the sale of adult use carmabls and adult use cannabls products 1s credlted to the 
Adult Use Cannabrs Publ1c Health and Safety and Mun1c1pal Opt-1n Fund, not 12% of all sales 
tax revenue collected under the Ma1ne Revrsed Statutes, T1tle 36, sectlon 1811 - WhlCh 1sa 
techmcal ﬁx to the already ex1s1t1ng statue 
Flnally 1t creates a deﬁmtlon for recovery commumty centers 1n the Marne Revrsed Statute, as 
follows 
0 Recovery commun1ty center means an lndependent, nonproﬁt orgamzatron led and 
govemed by representatlves of local recovery connnumues wrth a pnmary focus on 
recovery from substance use drsorder that provrdes nonclrmcal, peer recovery support 
servlces such as recovery support groups, recovery coachrng, telephone recovery support, 
skrll-bulldlng groups, hann reductron act1v1t1es, recovery-focused outreach programs to 
engage people seekmg recovery or 1n recovery and recovery focused pollcy and advocacy 
actrvrties 
Th1s deﬁmtlon was created by the Recovery Research Instrtute, a natronally recogmzed research 
organrzatlon focused on the rmpacts of recovery on commun1t1es across Amenca 
LD 1714 has strong b1-partrsan support 1n both the House and Senate, 1nclud1ng co-sponsorshrp 
from Senators Chrpman and Pouhot, Representatrves Crockett, Hasenfus, Matlack, M1l11ken, 
Perry and Repubhcan House M1nor1ty Leader Representatlve F aulklngham That 1s because 
recovery from substance use knows no pol1t1cal afﬁhatlon, recovery 1s for everyone and lmpacts 
everyone, regardless of race, gender, class, and yes, even party afﬁllatlon 
Recovery commun1ty centers are also for everyone, 1nclud1ng people m or seekmg recovery, 
famrly members, and young people Today you w1l1 hear countless stones of the 1mpact that 
these centers have had on Mamers from (ahnost) every part of our state 
House D1str1ct 21 Part of Bangor
When I th1nk about recovery centers, I th1nk about the BARN, located Just across the nver from 
where I l1ve 1n Bangor I thmk about then slogan, “support1ng recovery 1s a commtuuty 
respons1b1l1ty ” I bel1eve th1s to be true, but more than Just a commun1ty respons1b1l1ty, 
suppomng recovery 1s a state respons1b1l1ty It 1s th1s comm1ttee's respons1b1l1ty 
I do also want to ra1se an amendment for cons1derat1on by th1s comm1ttee It was brought to my 
attentron that there are concerns from recovery commumty members that 1f th1s fund passes, 
Mame could use th1s new fund as a way to supplant current fundmg rece1ved by recovery 
commun1ty centers Th1s 1s not the 1ntent1on of th1s fund The 1ntent1on of th1s fund 1s to ensure 
that strugghng recovery communlty centers can recelve enough fundmg to do the good work 
they are dolng That 1s why I am asklng the commlttee to cons1der addmg a lme that requ1res the 
Department to use th1s fundlng to supplement current fundlng, not supplant 1t 
Recovery Con1mun1ty Centers are staples to our commu111t1es We need folks to have a safe place 
and commun1ty 1f we want them to become successful 1n the1r recovery Journey 
Wh11e we all m1ght not agree that cannab1s should even be legal, I thlnk that we can all agree that 
slnce 1t 1s, some of the revenue from cannab1s sales should be used to support the recovery of 
people who want 1t - 1n the same way that we use some of the revenue to prevent the use of 
cannab1s nowX 
Thank you for your t1me and cons1derat1on I hope you W111 support th1s b1l1 I a1n happy to 
answer any quest1ons you have
