Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation, 
My name 1S Tess Parks, and I am a person in long-term recovery from substance use disorder 
(SUD) I have not had any mmd-altering substances since July of 2014 I am here today to testify 
in favor of passing LD 1714. 
I became a member of Portland Recovery Community Center (PRCC) in the summer of 2014m the ﬁrst few months of my recovery Journey At that time, I had _]l1S'[ moved into a women’S 
recovery residence in Portland I was 22 years old On the outside, I appeared to be relatively 
okay On the inside, I was suffocated by shame and fear Bemg so young, I was afraid I would 
never have fun again and making fnends my own age would be hard 
Although nearly a decade has come and gone, I still remember how welcomed I felt whenI 
started voltmteering at PRCC For months, I would wake up early on Sunday momings and ride 
my bike down Forest Ave to show up for my shift Volunteering at the front desk helped me 
make connections, ﬁnd ptupose through service, and build my self-esteem back up Many staff 
members and other volunteers were in recovery themselves I found role models and was shown 
that recovery was possible I found a community of people that did not Judge me On the 
contrary, I felt accepted and loved 
In the last mne years, PRCC has remained a part of my recovery Journey I ended up going back 
to school to pursue a master’s degree in Public Policy from USM I now utilize my passion for 
advocacy as PRCC’s Recovery Rising Coordinator, working on our statewide advocacy and 
public education efforts 
I know today you will likely hear statistics and data on the costs of addiction in Maine 
Yesterday, I attended the ﬁve-year memorial service of a family member who lost her life years 
too yotmg from an accidental overdose There 1S a part of me that misses her every day There 1S 
not a dollar amount high enough to capture the loss my family feels I know there are Mainers 
across the state that carry this same pain 
Recovery support services help save lives I urge this Committee to vote in favor of LD 1714 
I thank the Committee for the opportmiity to testify, and I am happy to answer any questions 
Sincerely,
Tess Parks
