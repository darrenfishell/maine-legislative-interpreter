Dear Senafor Grohoski, RepresenTaTive Perry, and honorable members of The JoinT 
Sfanding CommiTTee on Taxafion 
My name IS Amy Clark, I am a Bangor residenf, a member of The Board of Direcfors aT 
The Bangor Area Recovery Nelwork (BARN), The very firsT Recovery Communify Cenfer 
in The STaTe of Maine, a volunTeer organizer for The Maine Recovery Advocacy Proiecf, 
and an affecfed ofher I am here Today To Tesfify in favor of LD I714 An AcT To Creafea 
Susfainable Funding Source for Recovery Communify Cenfers 
Anyone who has ever spoken To me abouT my Time volunfeering aT BARN knows ThaTa 
3-minufe Time IimiT is simply laughable, so I am iusT going To Try To keep This as simple as 
possibleI 
Recovery communify cenTers like BARN didn'T ex|sT when my family needed Them, and 
whaf I remember The mosT from ThaT Time IS The profound loneliness How iT felT like we 
really were The only ones in The world, suffering silenTly, while The inescapable black 
cloud of our loved one's subsTance use hung over us 
I Think ThaT’s why I knew immediafely when I walked info BARN for The firsf Time ThaT iT 
was The mosT special place I had ever been, and Iiusf had To be a parT of iT I didn'T 
really know anyThing abouT subsTance use disorder, I didn'T really know anyfhing abouT 
recovery, I really didn'T even know whaf I was doing There I iusf knew ThaT somehow, I 
wanTed To Try To help families like mine I never could have imagined how much They 
would end up helping me in reTurn 
I Tell everyone who asks, and a IoT of people who don'T, ThaT I was sure I would go 
There, volunTeer for a few hours, and Then go abouT my merry life ThaT was six years 
ago This week 
For six years now I have had The privilege and honor To siT wilh families like mine, To hold 
Their hands while They cried, and cheer when They were happy, and above all else To 
make sure They knew ThaT They were never alone 
For six years I have been able To have a fronT row seaT To waTch some of The mosT 
amazing people I have ever meT, a few of whom are here Today, Transform Their lives in 
ways I never even knew were possible 
And while I don’T have Time To geT info The deTaiIs here, I will iusf say ThaT you cannof 
have These experiences or wifness These honesf To God miracles wiThouT being
p~ 
profoundly changed by Them forever I am a klnaer, heallhler, happler human belng, 
because of whal a recovery communlly cenler ollol for me
