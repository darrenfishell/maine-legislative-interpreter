My name 1s Kole Taylor, I am a person 1n recovery I am the Recovery Coach Coord1nator at the 
Bangor Area Recovery Network (BARN) 1n Brewer Ma1ne I supervlse a team of 10 Recovery 
Coaches I take the t1me to enhance my team’s ab1l1ty to have experlence and tralnlng that w1ll 
beneﬁt them 1n the1r long-term career goals Such as havmg an Introduct1on to Harm Reduct1on 
and Narcan Adnnmstratlon Last week we had the opportumty to attend street outreach w1th several 
dlfferent commun1ty partners 1n help1ng our unsheltered commun1ty W1th1n 20 m1nutes of our 
outreach, a gentleman had overdosed 1n front of our team We all acted qu1ckly and effic1ently We 
had a successﬁ1l overdose reversal by us1ng Narcan and ut1l1z1ng the tra1n1ngs we have recerved at 
the BARN Once the gentleman had been cleared by Emergency Servlces, we connected lnm to 
the support and appropnate resources the BARN has to offer 
Th1s 1s one of MANY d1fferent examples of how the BARN lmpacts the commmnty 1n the Bangor 
Area The BARN 1s a safe and support1ve space for those seek1ng recovery 1n whatever capac1ty
