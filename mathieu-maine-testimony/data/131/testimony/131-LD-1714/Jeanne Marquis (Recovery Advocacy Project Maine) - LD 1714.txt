IN FAVOR OF LD1714" An Act to Create a Sustainable Funding Source for Recovery 
Community Centers Using a Percentage of the Adult Use Cannabis Tax Revenue 
May 10. 2023 
Hello, Chairperson Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and the Committee of Taxation I 
am Jeanne Marquis, an organizer for the Maine Recovery Advocacy Project and a parent ofa 
person in recovery I am speaking in favor of LD1714 An Act to Create a Sustainable Funding 
Source for Recovery Community Centers 
I have learned so much through my son’s recovery and probably the biggest lesson is that his 
recovery will be a lifetime journey through which he will need the support of a community who 
understands and is stigma-free 
A good Recovery Community Center provides this type of support, along with connections to 
classes, workshops and meetings that help people move forward in their lives A good Recovery 
Community Center becomes that second family that celebrates each step in rebuilding each 
others’ lives and is there for you on the holidays when no one else may be Recoveryd 
Community Centers are essential in maintaining sobriety long after someone's been to detox, 
rehab and outpatient treatment -‘That is why Recovery Community Centers need to be sustained 
for the long-haul so they will be the consistent support for people in recovery such as my son 
The Adult Use Cannabis Tax Revenue would be an ideal, sustainable source of funding fora 
Recovery Community Center in every county throughout Maine The cannabis industry in Maine 
is thriving and brings tourism to our state, so it makes sense to put this money to use so our 
citizens also thrive This solution has bipartisan support, so please vote in favor of LD1714 
Thank you for your time and consideration
