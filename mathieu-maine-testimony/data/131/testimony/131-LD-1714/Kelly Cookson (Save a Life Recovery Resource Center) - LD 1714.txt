Testimony by Kelly Cookson/Save a Life Recovery Resource Center in Approval of LD714 
Dear esteemed members of the Committee on Taxation, 
My name is Kelly Cookson I am the director at Save a Life Recovery Resource Center in Lincoln Because 
of our rural location, we try to offer as many services as possible for those with substance use disorders 
and their loved ones This isn't1ust a j0b to me My daughter Ava is over 6 ‘/1 years free from her heroin 
and crack addiction We didn't have recovery community centers available to us in Connecticut when 
she ﬁrst entered recovery Having a center to go to would have benefitted her and I in countless ways, 
especially during her early recovery which is the time when many people are very vulnerable to 
relapses Because she did not have those types of services available and 12 step meetings were not 
helpful for her, it has taken a long time for her to integrate into society as a healthy, happy, productive 
member Honestly it is still a work in progress She is jLlSt now beginning to plan employment when her 
daughter begins school and continuing her education Research has shown us that recovery community 
centers greatly shorten the average length of time it takes people to get to the point in their recovery 
where they are able to successfully manage these tasks If she had the support of a center and the 
resources they offer, who knows how much further along she might be in the process 
Having a variety of programs would have been beneficial to her and I'm grateful I can now offer it to 
others Somehow Save a Life is managing to offer multiple support groups, one on one recovery 
coaching, activities such as yoga, art, writing and music along with harm reduction trainings and early 
intervention programs The reason I said "somehow" is we are a center that receives only 50,000$ from 
DHHS Our barebones operating budget is 200,000$ a year The remaining 75% of our funding comes 
from private donors While the donations are greatly appreciated, it is unreliable at best Sustainability 
to encourage substance use disorder remission, a reduction in overdose deaths and early prevention 
MUST include financial support 
We are asking that some of that funding comes from 12% of the new tax revenue source of recreational 
cannabis If you aren't someone who's been personally affected by substance use disorder, you may 
believe the existence of recovery centers doesn't impact you You might not care I'm not here to try to 
change your mind about that today The data obtained by Dr John F Kelly, professor of psychiatry at 
Harvard Medical School and director of the MGH Recovery Research Institute, has shown us recovery 
community centers shorten the period of time it takes for a person to obtain remission and that it 
fiscally makes sense to fund them The sooner someone achieves remission, the sooner they begin to 
become taxpaying members of society More financing of our center would mean more outreach to 
those in need, and more people finding and sustaining recovery We have a critical need for employees 
throughout the state of Maine currently Recovery centers can assist with that, but we need to have 
more financial resources available, especially in rural areas such as mine where there is no public 
transportation and there are 13 towns and townships we are tasked with serving 
Please consider the implications on all your constituents if this funding IS not approved I am respectfully 
asking that you vote "yes" on LD 1714 Thank you for your attention to this important matter
