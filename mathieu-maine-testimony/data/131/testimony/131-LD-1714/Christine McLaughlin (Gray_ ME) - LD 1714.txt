I am a volunteer at Portland Recovery Community Center (PRCC), and I’m in recovery. I’m from Gray, 
Maine. My name is Christine Feylyne McLaughlin.  
Recently, I was sent to PRCC by a social worker after leaving the hospital. I suffer from depression, post 
traumatic syndrome, anxiety disorder, and I’m a recovering alcoholic and addict.  
The Center was and is the base of my recovery plan. I’ve been to PR CC for three months, and I have put 
a recovery plan together using the various groups as tools for my recovery. I have made a lot of progress 
in my recovery. I also utilized a recovery coach who has been a great benefit to me.  
I support LD 1714, as the fu nding would be beneficial to Maine’s recovery community centers. I know 
that continuing seeking services at PRCC is critical for my recovery. I urge you to pass LD 1714.  
Thank you,
