LD 1714
Dear honorable members of our House, Senate and Committee, my name is Candace 
Greenberg and I reside in Bridgton, Maine. I am a person in recovery, I also work in 
the recovery field at Lakes Region Recovery Center in Bridgton. I’ve accomplished 
personal and professional goals as a sober person because of my work with LADAC 
counseling, Recovery Coaching and support meetings at Recovery Centers. I am 
writing in favor of LD174. I have seen the positive results of engaging people in a 
program of recovery…families affected positively, education and employment 
opportunities, good, positive, healthy changes with sobriety. Thank you for your kind 
attention to this very important Bill, LD174. Please consider and accept this written 
testimony as a resounding IN FAVOR of the passage of this crucial Bill to help and 
keep helping our Recovery Community in Maine.
