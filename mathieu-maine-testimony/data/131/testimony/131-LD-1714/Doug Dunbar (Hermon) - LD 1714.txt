 
Testimony of Doug Dunbar from Hermon, Maine 
In Support of LD 1714 
An Act to Create a Sustainable Funding Source for Recovery Community Centers  
Using a Percentage of the Adult Use Cannabis Tax Revenue 
Public Hearing: May10, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Committee, my name is Doug 
Dunbar. I’m a resident of Hermon and person in recovery for the past five years from alcohol use 
disorder. This testimony is offered to thank Representative Rana for sponsoring LD 1714, to 
express appreciation to the bill’s cosponsors, and to encourage your support of this urgently-
needed legislation. 
 
Although I appreciate the opportunity to share a few thoughts, many people with far greater 
expertise will testify in favor of LD 1714. I know you’ll listen carefully to what they have to say. 
I can simply tell you recovery community centers are a vital source of connection, hope and 
recovery for thousands of Mainers. They serve as both a safety net for individuals at their bottom 
seeking a new beginning and a place for people in long-term recovery to give back, support 
others and sustain their journey.   
 
Given the current epidemic of overdoses in Maine (estimated at 10,000+ in 2022) and overdose 
deaths (estimated at 716 Mainers in 2022), recovery community centers have never been more 
important. They need and deserve a source of financial support from the state that is codified, 
steady and relatively predictable. 
 
If you don’t recognize the urgent need for recovery community centers or understand why state 
funding is necessary, please visit a center near you ( https://portlandrecovery.org/wp-

center, as well as others who find comfort and renewal there. Most importantly, listen to what 
they have to say.  
 
Thanks for your consideration of this testimony and for joining in support of LD 1714.
