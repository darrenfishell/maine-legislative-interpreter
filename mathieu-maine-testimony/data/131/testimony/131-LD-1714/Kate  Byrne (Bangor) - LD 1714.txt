Dear Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing
Committee on Taxation:
To start - to be blunt - recovery centers save lives. They provide a safe place for 
addicts of all stripes to be instead of using, drinking, eating, whatever their -ism is. 
This isn't just me reading off a paper. I know because places like the Portland 
Recovery Community Center and the BARN have saved my life time and again. 
Because of the connections I've made in those buildings I've had space to apply for 
jobs, write, make connections all of which have helped keep me from just going out 
for a bottle of bourbon and drinking myself stupid or dead.
How do tax dollars come in to play in terms of such centers?
The benefits of the tax on cannabis can be targeted to help folks in these halls. It 
doesn't matter how many times a meeting passes the seventh tradition baskets. If ten 
meetings a day pull in fifty dollars there isn't going to be enough for property taxes, 
HVAC, water, maintenance, cleaning supplies, toilet paper (and all the other sundries 
associated with a building open to the public).
This isn't the first time a tax would be going to an impacted party. For example, taxes 
on firearms are used for education, safety, and wildlife preservation. That's what 
happens in the halls of the various recovery halls. Education and preservation. For 
your fellow human beings.
Every person has a battle they're fighting. Every body needs a hand. Providing funds 
for these organizations who are doing just that will ensure they're not hoping and 
relying on a big dollar donor to come out of the shadows in these uncertain times.
Let's make recovery a permanent possibility for anyone who's looking for it.
