Dear Taxation Committee members:
I am writing to urge you to support LD 1714: An Act to Create a Sustainable Funding Source 
for Recovery Community Centers, and to prioritize the establishment and funding of recovery community centers for individuals who are seeking help for substance use disorders. As you are no doubt aware, substance use is a major public health issue that a ﬀ ects millions of Mainers and 
their families every year.
Acadia Family Center recognizes that recovery community centers provide an essential resource 
for those who are struggling with substance use and can play an important role in the Mount Desert Island communities that we serve. These centers o ﬀ er a safe and supportive environment 
where individuals can come together to share their experiences and support each other in their journey towards recovery. The services provided by recovery community centers are designed to help individuals build the skills and knowledge they need to overcome addiction and maintain their sobriety over the long term.
Research has shown that recovery community centers are e ﬀ ective at reducing rates of substance 
use and improving overall quality of life for those in recovery. Individuals who participate in recovery community center programs often have higher rates of abstinence from drugs and alco-hol, are more likely to maintain stable families and employment, and have better mental health outcomes than those who did not participate in such programs.
In addition to providing support for those in recovery, recovery community centers also serve 
as a valuable resource for the broader community. They help to reduce the stigma surrounding addiction and promote a more positive and compassionate understanding of the challenges faced by those who are struggling with substance use disorders. By providing education and outreach services to schools, workplaces, and other community organizations, recovery community centers help to raise awareness about the risks of addiction and the importance of early intervention.
I urge you to take action to establish and fund recovery community centers in our state. By doing 
so, we can provide much-needed support and resources for those who are struggling with addic-tion, reduce rates of substance use, and build a healthier and more compassionate community for all. Thank you for your attention to this important issue.
     Sincerely,
     
     Rota L. Knott     Executive Director     Acadia Family Center
