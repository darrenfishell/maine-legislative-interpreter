 I have been coming to the Bangor Area Recovery Network since the mid 2010’s and 
my experience attending meeting’s and taking part in all of the event’s that staff and 
other volunteer coordinators have offered has been extremely helpful for my recovery
and growth as a personal struggling with addiction.
   I have seen how society has stigmatized those who suffer from the awful and 
debilitating disease of alcoholism and drug addiction. My experience at the BARN 
has shown me that through the effort’s of caring and motivated individuals, positive 
change can continue to shine light on the struggle that co-occurring disorder’s bring to
individual’s live’s in recovery. I have found that the BARN is seeking to end 
discrimination to those trying to re-enter and continue to progress in the community. I
feel the BARN’s effort’s raise awareness of stigma surrounding addiction in the 
workforce. 
   I truly hope that the BARN continue’s to grow and change. I am currently a 
volunteer for the BARN and hope to continue to be part of the solution. I hope that 
the progressive efforts the BARN put’s in place continue to bring forth change in 
society moving into the future.
