recovery from substance abuse drsorder (SUD) Wlnch means that I have not m1sused any 
add1ct1ve substance srnce July 1“ , 2021 I am speakmg to you today 1n favor of passlng LD1714 
Becommg a member of the Bangor Area Recovery Network was one of the best dec1s1ons 
I have made early 1n my recovery At the tlme I was a res1dent at a men’s recovery resrdence 1n 
Bangor ME I appeared to be okay, but on the 1ns1de, I was belng suffocated by the feel1ngsI had 
been h1d1ng through years of abuslng substances I carr1ed the welght of depresslon, hum1l1at1on 
and anger MI 
The suggestlon of volunteermg at the BARN scared me Berng new to recovery I was 
afrald of not berng accepted, I qu1ckIy dlscovered there was noth1ng to fear as I was welcomed 
w1th open arms and understandlng of my s1tuat1on Through volunteer1ng at the front desk my 
self-esteem grew a.nd I qurckly real1zed I was not alone , 
< I made connectrons and met many others 1nc1ud1ng staff that were also 1n recovery It was 
proven to me that recovery was poss1ble, and I felt accepted and loved 
Durrng the last couple years, I have attended many mutual a1d meet1ngs Wrtnessed 
countless celebratlons as my frrends’ reached mrlestones 1n then recovery I am currently the 
manager of a recovery resrdence and I suggest to all to become 1nvolved wrth the BARN 
volunteerrng Attendlng the d1fferentfunct1ons and soc1al events, provmg that recovery can be 
fun! 
The more we 1nvest 1n recovery resources, the less funerals my commun1ty attends 
LDl7l4 W111 prov1de Ma1ne recovery commumty center w1th a susta1nab1e fundmg stream for 
years to come Tlns will allow RCC’s to be properly staﬁed and provrded needed serv1ces that

ensure that every 'RCC 1n Mame has the resources necessary to support people wrth SUD

Smcerely,
