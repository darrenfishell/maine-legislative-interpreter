Testimony of Senator Russell Black 
LD 180 "An Act to Allow a Person to File a Paper Copy of a Timber Harvest 
Notiﬁcation Form" 
Public Hearing: Wednesday February 8, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry. 
My name is Senator Russell Black, andl am a State Senator representing Senate District 5, 
which includes a number of towns in Franklin and Somerset County. I am here to present 
LD 180 "An Act to Allow a Person to File a Paper Copy of a Timber Harvest Notiﬁcation 
F orm" 
I was asked to put this bill in for landowners and loggers to be able to ﬁle the intent to 
harvest with a paper copy. The department requires an online application. After discussions 
with the department, I have found that landowners can request a paper copy of the form. 
This is for people who do not have the ability to ﬁle because they do not have internet ora 
computer. Loggers still have to ﬁle online and do not have the paper copy option. 
I have been asked by loggers and the Professional Logging Contractors of Maine to request 
that loggers have the same option as landowners to ﬁle a paper copy of the Timber Harvest 
Notiﬁcation form. The loggers are often the frontline for landowners to get there land 
harvested and they rely on the loggers to do all necessary paperwork. Some of the small 
loggers have the same difﬁculty with online access for ﬁling as the landowners. 
I will stop my testimony and I will let the experts behind me explain. I am happy to try and 
answer any questions. Thank you.
