As a retired self-employed professional forester consultant for many years, I was and still am 
opposed to the discontinuance of the paper copy forest harvest notification form. While the 
online notification process may be much faster for those foresters and land owners who are 
computer literate, it remains much more time consuming and frustrating for some of the older 
foresters and landowners, particularly absentee landowners who are completely unfamiliar 
with the online form and filing process. 
I would like to see going forward that the forester and landowner be given the option of either 
method of Ô¨Åling. The paper copy process was effective for many years and was more straight 
fon/vard and far less confusing to many foresters and landowners than the current online 
method.
