LD 1326
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, My Name is Cory Reynolds and I am in 
support of LD-1326 I believe we need to keep our students safe and to do that is 
getting all schools to change the locks on doors to make them locked and should be 
able to use a Faculy ID Badge to lock the door. The Faculty would be able to use the 
Faculty ID Badge to open the door to the building and to the classroom, and lock the 
door. I know of a School Dept. back in my hometown In Massachusetts that has just 
started this and has worked. Please stop sending money to Ukraine and actually keep 
our Teachers and students safe that are In America. I ask you to please vote in support
of LD- 1326 
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
