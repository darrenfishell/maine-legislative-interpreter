LD 1326 - An Act to Increase School Security Through Design and Protocol 
  
 
Memorandum of Support  
Date:  April 26, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Education and Cultural Affairs.  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 1326 - An Act to Increase School Security Through Design and Protocol 
 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 1326 - An Act to Increase School Security 
Through Design and Protocol 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. I am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member.  
 
School shootings have been an issue since they were made into gun free zones in 1990. Title XVII, Section 
1702, of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647), the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, makes it 
illegal for any individual to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone. 
 
Requiring schools to complete training and meet basic security standards is an easy win for preventing some 
tragedies. It won't stop everyone, but it does help prevent easy access.  
 
Please support this bill as we need to better protect our children.  
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME 
Sanford City Councilor 
Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun Owners of Maine 
Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club
