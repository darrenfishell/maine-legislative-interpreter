I am writing to ask you to OPPOSE this bill.  I am a former teacher and now work to 
prepare teachers.  Schools need to take the responsibility to ensure the safety of their 
building.  Teachers are overwhelmed with the responsibilities of today's classrooms.  
They should not be held liable for mistakes, even those that lead to deadly 
consequences.  Passing legislation such as this will only scare future teachers away 
and we are already in a crisis of teacher shortages.
