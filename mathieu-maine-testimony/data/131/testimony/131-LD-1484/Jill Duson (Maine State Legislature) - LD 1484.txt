Testimony of Senator Jill Duson in Support of LD 1484, “An Act to Improve Sexual Assault Kit 
Tracking" 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
April 27, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, my name is Jill Duson andl 
represent Senate District 27, which includes parts of Westbrook and Portland. I am pleased to 
speak in support of LD I 484. "An Act to Improve Sexual Assault Kit Tracking." 
MECASA released a report in 2018 following a study to collect data, on how sexual assault kits 
are handled in the state and what needs to change. Since then, we have not gathered any 
information on the status of sexual assault kits across the state. This bill takes an important step 
in implementing recommendations from that study. If we are to effectively address issues related 
to sexual violence, we need information in order to make change. 
These ﬁndings were discovered after extensive research by an advisory commission formed in 
March 2018. One of the recommendations enumerated in the report is to create an inventory 
system to gather data on the status of sexual assault kits, which is exactly what this bill does. By 
creating a position in this lab whose sole job is to track sexual assault kits, we would be takinga 
ﬁrst step towards building a cohesive and effective system to track kits and collect information. 
We need to build a system that supports survivors in the long-term. This inventory system would 
improve accessibility for survivors to keep track of the status of their own kits. Having access to 
this knowledge can be vital in their own process of healing and allows survivors to choose what 
actions they wish to pursue. Moving through the legal system is a traumatic experience. We need 
to ensure that we working toward building a framework that supports survivors unconditionally. 
lt is time for us to reform our systems to better support survivors statewide. This bill is an 
incremental and critical step forward in the right direction. I urge you to vote “Ought to Pass” on 
LD 1484. 
Thank you for your consideration and l would be happy to answer questions.
