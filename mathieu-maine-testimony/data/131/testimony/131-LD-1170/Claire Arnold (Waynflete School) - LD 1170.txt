Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Claire and I go to Waynflete School. 
I am writing as a student to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1170.
As a teenager with a lot of friends in Boston, I love to take the Amtrak down to see 
my friends on the weekend. I think passing this bill would be really beneficial for 
Mainers like myself who love the environment and want to have a lesser 
environmental impact when we’re doing the things we love. Here are some reasons 
this bill is important to me:
This bill will make it easier for Mainers to take the train, reducing carbon emissions 
from. 
The Downeaster is hugely important to Mainers and their transportation needs, but it 
can be inaccessible. This bill will make it easier for us to take the train. 
Transportation accounts for 54% of Maine’s carbon emissions, this bill will help 
reduce that number. 
Having access to public transportation makes it easier for Mainers like me and you to 
do what we love, and feel good about lessening our carbon footprint. Thank you for 
your time and consideration!
Respectfully submitted, 
Claire Arnold
