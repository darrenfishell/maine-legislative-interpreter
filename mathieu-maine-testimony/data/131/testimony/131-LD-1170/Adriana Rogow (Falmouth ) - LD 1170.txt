Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Adriana Rogow and I go to Falmouth High School 
I am writing as a student and climate activist to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 1170.
This bill matters to me as a student of Falmouth because of the comparatively limited 
public transportation available in the state of Maine. This bill would help reduce the 
state's transportation carbon emissions, currently accounting for 54% of our total 
emissions. It would also provide a desired form of transportation to the people of 
Maine. 
- The bill will lead the way in making passenger rail more accessible and attractive to 
Maine commuters.
- The bill will increase the opportunity for commuters and employers to use the rail 
for day-to-day commuting. 
- The quality of life for older Mainers and Mainers with disabilities who may be 
unable to drive is increased with the availability of public transit systems such as the 
passenger rail. 
- As young people, we will bear the costs of legislative inaction. If the legislature does
not act now, the people of the younger generation are going to be left to deal with the 
more severe damage that climate change will cause. We encourage you to reduce 
carbon emissions through this rail system. 
I hope you take these points into consideration when making the decision on this bill. 
It matters a great deal to me and others I know and would be one step the state of 
Maine can take to show that it is doing its part to combat climate change. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Adriana Rogow
