Dear
Committee
Members,
My
name
is
Max
McDonough,
I
am
a
resident
of
Orono,
and
I’m
writing
in
Support
of
LD.1 170
Resolve,
to
Promote
Passenger
Rail
for
Commuters,
LD
1 170.
I
urge
you
to
vote
to
pass
this
piece
of
legislation.
I
am
an
avid
supporter
of
public
transit,
as
it
provides
an
option
to
get
from
one
place
to
another
ef ficiently ,
economically ,
and
sustainably
when
it's
done
right.
When
traveling
I
use
trains
frequently .
I
have
taken
the
Downeaster
multiple
times
and
my
experience
has
been
great.
I
can
relax
and
do
something
else
with
my
time
rather
than
drive
down
the
road
for
hours.
Not
everyone
has
to
take
the
train
but
there
is
no
reason
to
not
give
everyone
the
option.
Increasing
frequency
of
rail
service
will,
●
Create
a
more
accessible
service
to
the
public
,
making
it
easier
for
commuters,
tourists,
young
people,
and
anyone
who
cannot
drive
or
does
not
have
a
car .
●
Expanded
passenger
rail
is
a
safer
way
to
get
to
where
you
want
to
go
,
especially
during
winter
and
inclement
weather .
●
Frequent
service
will
ease
traf fic
on
the
road,
take
cars
of f
of
city
streets,
and
create
greater
economic
opportunities
at
every
city
and
town
with
a
stop.
Everyone
does
not
want
to
drive,
people
should
have
another
option.
It
is
now
known
that
car
infrastructure
of
the
past
is
expensive
to
maintain,
expand,
and
is
bankrupting
cities
and
towns
around
the
nation.
Let’ s
take
a
step
now
to
create
a
more
fiscally
sustainable,
clean,
and
safer
future
for
our
state.
Respectfully ,
-Max
McDonough
