Senator
Chipman,
Representative
W illiams,
and
the
esteemed
members
of
the
T ransportation
Committee,
My
name
is
Cole
Cochrane,
I
am
a
senior
at
Thornton
Academy
in
Saco,
and
I
am
here
on
behalf
of
Maine
Y outh
Action,
a
statewide
youth
advocacy
group
that
represents
hundreds
of
young
Mainers
across
the
state
from
varying
backgrounds.
W e
are
here
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1 170,
a
Resolve
to
Promote
Passenger
Rail
for
Commuters.
[I
wish
I
could
be
up
in
Augusta
today ,
but
I
am
curr ently
in
class
at
the
moment.
However ,
I
felt
the
need
to
call
in
to
testify ,
for
many
young
Mainers
have
found
this
bill
to
be
quite
important
to
them.]
Y oung
Mainers
have
a
major
stake
in
the
future
of
our
transportation
system.
When
the
state
did
its
planning
decades
ago
regarding
transportation,
it
expanded
our
highways,
encouraged
the
use
of
the
private
automobile,
and
reduced
our
access
to
public
transportation.
Those
changes
did
not
immediately
af fect
the
decision
makers
of
that
age;
instead,
those
decisions
af fected
future
Mainers,
which
are
us.
W e
now
face
a
multitude
of
problems
from
those
decisions.
Private
automobiles
are
now
a
necessity
to
mobility .
W e
no
longer
have
viable
alternatives,
and
the
extensive
public
transit
networks
in
Maine,
which
were
historically
known
to
be
reliable
and
convenient,
have
been
greatly
diminished.
This
has
posed
challenges
to
young
Mainers.
Due
to
cars
being
the
only
viable
option
for
transportation,
we
face
many
barriers
to
mobility
around
our
state.
For
example,
according
to
the
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics,
the
costs
of
owning
a
car
can
be
between
25-38%
of
one’ s
income
.
That
very
same
agency
defines
“af fordability”
as
housing
and
transportation
costs
accounting
for
45%
of
income.
These
high
transportation
costs
have
created
barriers
for
young
Mainers.
This
applies
to
job
opportunities,
access
to
basic
amenities,
and
overall
general
mobility .

However ,
that
is
not
the
only
problem
resulting
from
these
past
decisions.
There
is
also
the
climate
crisis.
54%
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
Maine
come
from
the
transportation
sector .
It
is
also
no
coincidence
that
78%
of
Mainers
drive
to
work
alone
.
The
dependency
on
cars
and
the
push
for
car
centric
infrastructure
has
driven
[no
pun
intended]
the
increase
in
our
state’ s
emissions.
The
problems
we
are
facing
require
transformative
solutions.
Even
the
Maine
Climate
Council’ s
transportation
working
group
has
called
for
increased
investment
in
public
transportation
and
transit
oriented
development,
which
is
why
LD
1 170
is
so
important.
The
bill
would
create
a
visionary
roadmap
for
significant
improvements
to
passenger
rail
service
from
Brunswick
to
W ells
and
Sanford.
This
would
mean
that
commuters
will
have
an
af fordable,
reliable
and
environmentally
friendly
mode
of
transportation.
It
would
also
have
benefits
for
young
Mainers,
who
desperately
need
transportation
alternatives
like
passenger
rail.
I
mentioned
earlier
in
my
testimony
how
decision
makers
back
then
planned
the
transportation
system
we
have
today .
W ell,
you
are
the
decision
makers
now ,
and
you
have
the
power
to
direct
the
state
of
transportation
in
Maine’ s
future,
the
future
young
Mainers
will
have
to
live
with.
W e
are
calling
for
investments
in
our
public
transportation
system,
and
LD
1 170
is
a
pragmatic
step
to
take
in
order
to
get
there.
I
ur ge
the
committee
to
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1 170.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service.
