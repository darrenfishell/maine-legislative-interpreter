Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Nynke Ham and I live in/go to school Bar Harbor/College of the Atlantic 
I am writing as a student to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1170.
Taking the train does not need to be motivated only by commuting time and financial 
savings. In the Netherlands, where I am from, many employers sponsor their 
employees to take the train since it is a comfortable work environment. They 
experience less stress then while driving, and are able to use their commute as a little 
bit of work time. By working together with the employers near the Boston and 
Portland train stations, and improving some train carts to have an office like work 
environment more people will be able to afford to take a train that might be slightly 
slower then driving. Still the times will need to improve. Right now it takes 3h20min 
to take the train from Brunswick, and it takes 2h30min to drive during peak times. 
Additionally there is no train service during peak times, which would be a key focus 
point. 
Apart from increasing the numbers and the revenue of train services, it is also highly 
important that train service improvements are explored further to lift more people out 
of mobility poverty and to lower strains on the climate. Mobility poverty means that 
people do not have the means to get to where they want to go. As a student in rural 
Maine I experience this often since I do not own a car, and am fully reliant on public 
transportation. 
Respectfully submitted,
