Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Ian Doherty and I live/go to school in Falmouth and attend Falmouth 
High School. 
I am writing as a student and concerned citizen to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 1170.
Out of all the important things that this bill will help do, one of the most crucial is that
it will initiate a study to investigate upgrading an outdated and old rail system. This 
will work hand in hand with helping to make our rail system not only become more 
attractive and useful to commuters and all Maine citizens but will be a huge step in 
understanding the real consequences and issues regarding sustainability in terms of 
our rail systems. Furthermore, if we pass this bill it not only will allow us as a state to 
work on improving and upgrading our rail system but will also help us understand our
rail system's impact on the state’s overall carbon emissions. This could even be used 
to help solve problems with other forms of transportation and will serve as an 
example for both Maine citizens and other states can follow. As a young person going
into an ever-changing world thanks to climate change, among other issues, having a 
functioning and sustainable rail system is very important. Not only will it help to 
understand and solve carbon emission problems, but it will also help people of all 
locks of life to travel by rail and will cater to the greater Maine Community.
Respectfully submitted, 
Ian Doherty
