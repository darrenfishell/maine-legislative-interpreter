Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
I live and own/operate a business in Biddeford. 
I to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1170.
I grew up in a large city that was pretty car dependent, but managed to get around by 
bike, city/school bus, or on foot for most of my daily needs. I then lived in Boston and
New York and made it all the way to 30 without the need of a personal vehicle. This 
was because I could take the train (and bus) both within the city and to travel to other 
places. 
When I moved to Maine in 2013, I bought a car because my mobility surely would 
have been extremely limited living in the Mission Hill/Willard Beach area of South 
Portland. 
Now I live in Biddeford, about a 10 minute walk from the Saco train station and I still
can’t use that train reliably to get to and from Portland and beyond. The schedule just 
doesn’t make that a viable option most days. I have taken the train to portland once. 
I’ve also taken it to and from Boston a few times. But it’s still not enough as a 
primary mover. We need better, quicker, more reliable and frequent train service. This
bill is a step toward that. 
The Saco exit is the busiest on the interstate and Biddeford also has congestion issues.
There are plans underway to destroy habitat in Biddeford in favor of moving more 
cars. The study that the DoT conducted did little to imagine a world with better train 
service. Instead it simply makes way for more cars. In Biddeford we have an influx of
people moving into the mills who commute to Boston. The simple choice for them 
should be to take the train, but my fear is that most of them probably drive. There 
should be more, not less, friction there. Make it easy to choose the train!!
Respectfully submitted,
Chrystina Gastelum
