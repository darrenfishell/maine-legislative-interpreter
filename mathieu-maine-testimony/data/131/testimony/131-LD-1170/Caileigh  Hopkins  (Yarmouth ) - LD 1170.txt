Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Caileigh. I live in Yarmouth and go to school at Waynflete High School 
in Portland Maine]. 
I am writing as a student to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1170.
I moved to Maine from right outside Boston a few years ago so I have utilized The 
Downeaster. Whatever direction I have been traveling, The Downeaster has always 
been an exciting part of my travels and has allowed me to keep in contact with friends
and family across Maine And Massachusetts.
- The Downeaster will allow commuters and employees alike to travel with ease. 
- This bill will give more Mainers the opportunity to explore parts of Maine and 
Massachusetts in a cost effective way.
- Will allow older Mainers to continue to engage in activities when they no longer can
drive. 
- Allow all Mainers to have access to new opportunities without the obstacle of 
transportation. 
A few weeks ago my hockey team (the girls Waynflete/South Portland/Cape 
Elizabeth coop) took a trip down to Bostons in the train to see the Frozen at Fenway 
Women's College teams play. It was an amazing experience that I will always 
remember fondly. The time on the trial grew out of the team's camaraderie, and the 
next day we played our best game of the season. I hope that other young players can 
do the same and have access to watch and experience a high level of sports from other
parts of New England. 
Respectfully submitted,
