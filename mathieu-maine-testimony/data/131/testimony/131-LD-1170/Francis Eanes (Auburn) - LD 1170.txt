T estimony
in
support
of

1 170,
“Resolve,

Commuters”
Senator
Chipman,
Representative
W illiams,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
T ransportation,
my
name
is
Francis
Eanes
and
I
live
in
Auburn,
Maine,
and
I’m
the
Executive
Director
of
the
Maine
Labor
Climate
Council.
I
submit
this
testimony
in
favor
of
LD
1 170,
“Resolve,
to
Promote
Passenger
Rail
for
Commuters,”
and
to
suggest
some
minor
amendments
to
the
bill
that
we
believe
would
make
it
even
stronger .
The
Maine
Labor
Climate
Council
is
a
coalition
of
20
labor
unions
and
labor
or ganizations
dedicated
to
fighting
climate
change
and
broader
forms
of
inequality
at
the
same
time.
T o
this
end,
we
are
happy
to
support
Representative
O’Neil’ s
Resolve.
Passenger
rail
service
is
an
ener gy-ef ficient
and
ef fective
means
of
public
transportation.
Its
expansion
and
operational
improvement
is
necessary
for
the
state
to
meet
its
climate
and
ener gy
goals,
as
well
as
improving
connectivity
among
Maine
communities
and
between
Maine
and
southern
New
England.
Anything
that
improves
existing
service
such
as
the
line
between
Brunswick
and
Boston
moves
us
in
the
right
direction.
For
these
reasons
we
support
this
Resolve
for
the
Department
of
T ransportation
to
study
the
issue.
In
our
support
for
Representative
O’Neil’ s
Resolve,
we
would
also
like
to
suggest
some
friendly
amendments
that,
if
included,
would
in
our
view
strengthen
it.
Recruiting
and
retaining
a
highly
skilled
workforce
is
critical
for
any
industry ,
and
a
particularly
acute
issue
in
the
rail
sector ,
which
nationally
has
seen
sustained
labor
shortages
over
the
last
few
years
due
to
a
variety
of
factors,
including
the
wages
and
working
conditions
of
the
employees
who
build,
maintain,
and
operate
the
rail
lines
and
service
for
both
freight
and
passenger
sectors.
Any
expansion
of
service
frequency ,
changes
to
scheduling,
or
other
operational
changes
aimed
at
improving
overall
service
could
have
impacts
–
both
positive
and
negative
–
on
recruitment
of
a
future
workforce
and/or
the
retention
of
the
existing
workforce,
and
ought
to
be
captured
in
this
study .
At
the
same
time,
rail
workers
themselves
are
a
wealth
of
knowledge
about
the
strengths,
weaknesses,
and
opportunities
for
improving
on
the
status
quo.
Amending
Section
1
with
the
following
text
could
address
both
of
these
important
issues
in
ways
that
could
strengthen
the
depth,
integrity ,
and
impact
of
the
study:

Section
1:
That
the
Department
of
T ransportation
shall,
in
coordination
with
the
Northern
New
England
3
Passenger
Rail
Authority
and
consultation
with
the
labor
or ganizations
that
represent
employees
on
the
rail
line
in
question,
conduct
a
study
to
evaluate
improvements
to
the
passenger
rail
service
between
Brunswick
and
Boston
…
A….
B….
…..
J.
Evaluate
the
impacts
of
proposed
changes
on
the
total
number
of
temporary
and
permanent
jobs
created
or
maintained,
and
on
the
ability
of
rail
operators
to
recruit
and
retain
a
highly
skilled
workforce.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
