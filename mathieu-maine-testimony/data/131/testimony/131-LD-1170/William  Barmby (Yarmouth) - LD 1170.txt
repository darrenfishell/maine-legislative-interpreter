Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Will  and I live in Yarmouth.
I am writing  as a student to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1170.
The possibilities of public transportation are magnificent. The Downeaster Amtrak is 
great. But I have a few things to say:
Behavioral economics tells us that people don’t always  behave rationally. Even when
a transportation system is great, if someone already has a mode of transport that is 
“fine,” they might not adjust their habits. Sometimes all people need is a nudge. It’s 
almost always useful, therefore, for a government department to spend some time 
researching how to make people aware of and inspired to use the resources the 
department provides to the public. 
The Amtrak could certainly be improved. A review of the current state of affairs 
strikes me as very reasonable. Let’s identify how to make the Amtrak the best it can 
be! Let’s inspire people to reduce their climate footprint. Let’s show people that the 
government can work.
Respectfully submitted, 
William Barmby
