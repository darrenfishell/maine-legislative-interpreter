Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Anna and I live in Yarmouth and go to school in Portland, Maine.
I am writing as a student, young person, and public transit-reliant individual to urge 
you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1170.
It is essential that Maine’s public transit systems are accessible, convenient, efficient, 
and reliable. For the sake of the people and the environment, our transit systems need 
to be operating at their greatest potential. LD 1170 accomplishes this by directing the 
Department of Transportation to study what improvements could be made to the 
Amtrak Downeaster. These improvements will better serve Maine’s commuters, many
of whom frequently travel to Boston for work using the Amtrak Downeaster rail. 
I will soon be a freshman in college, car-less and dependent on public transit. Without
efficient transit systems that meet my needs, I will not be able to go home for 
Chanukah, birthdays, and emergencies in a cost-effective and timely manner. 
Improving Maine’s transportation also impacts my future because low-carbon transit, 
such as passenger rail, is a solution to the climate crisis that threatens the well-being 
of my generation and those to come.
I have also seen first-hand the impact that vehicular carbon emissions has on Maine’s 
efforts to minimize our environmental impact. I was a working group member of the 
Maine Climate Council and was frustrated, but not surprised, to hear from the Council
report that the transportation sector accounts for 54% of Maine’s emissions. To reach 
our climate goals we must improve on, and invest in, our passenger rail.
Respectfully submitted, 
Anna Siegel
