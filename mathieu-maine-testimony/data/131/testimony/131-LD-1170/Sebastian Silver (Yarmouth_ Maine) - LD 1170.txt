Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Sebastian Silver and I live in Yarmouth High School
I am writing as a student to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1170.
My Mom once had a job that had a 40 minute commute, but now with the knowledge 
of this bill I think that this commuter rail would’ve been very helpful. Additionally, 
I’m in a musical ensemble but we all live in different areas all over Maine, but with 
this commuter rail we can get together and practice with much ease. 
The reasons I think this bill will be beneficial to Maine life is because the widespread 
access to a commuter rail would not only be more convenient but it would also have a
big impact on the amount of carbon emissions being produced by public 
transportation and it can make getting places so much easier. Additionally, this bill, if 
enacted, would make day to day commuting so much easier for folks who have long 
commute times, so therefore I think this bill would be very beneficial. 
In conclusion, because of prior experience and the evidence presented before me, I 
can’t, in good faith, not support this bill and I think that. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Sebastian Silver
