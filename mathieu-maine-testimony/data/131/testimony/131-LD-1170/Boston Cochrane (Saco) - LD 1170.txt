To:
Senator
Chipman,
Representative
Williams,
and
Honorable
members
of
the
committee
From:
Boston
Cochrane
Re:
Testimony
in
Support
of
Resolve,
to
Promote
Passenger
Rail
for
Commuters,
LD
1170
My
name
is
Boston
Cochrane
and
I
go
to
school
at
Thornton
Academy
in
Saco.
I
am
writing
as
a
student
to
urge
you
to
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1170.
As
a
young
Mainer,
I
want
a
future
that
has
minimized
the
impact
of
climate
change
and
a
future
that
has
made
transportation
affordable
and
accessible.
First,
transportation
is
the
leading
contributor
to
carbon
emissions
in
Maine.
Creating
passenger
rail
that
citizens
can
rely
on
reduces
the
necessity
of
a
car
to
commute.
Less
cars
on
Maine’s
roads
means
less
carbon
emissions,
which
means
a
cleaner
environment
for
Mainers
now,
and
generations
to
come.
In
addition
to
environmental
beneﬁts,
LD
1170
would
allow
for
accessible
passenger
rail
that
is
affordable
for
citizens.
Transportation
that
serves
the
community
is
what
I
want
to
see
in
Maine’s
future.
As
a
young
Mainer,
I
want
to
see
changes
made
to
limit
the
impacts
of
the
climate
crisis
and
I
want
to
have
conﬁdence
in
Maine’s
future.
Accessible
and
affordable
passenger
rail
is
progress
towards
a
clean
and
community-driven
future
in
Maine.
Respectfully
submitted,
Boston
Cochrane
