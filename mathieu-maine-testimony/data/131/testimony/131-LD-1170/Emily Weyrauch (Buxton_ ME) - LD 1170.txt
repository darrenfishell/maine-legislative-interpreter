Re: Testimony in Support of Resolve, to Promote Passenger Rail for Commuters, LD 
1170
My name is Emily Weyrauch and I live in Buxton.
I am writing as a concerned citizen to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1170.
It is clear that in order to fight climate change, we must as a society reduce our 
dependence on driving alone as a mode of transportation. 
However, until we have transportation options that are competitive with driving (in 
terms of time, convenience, and cost spent), alternative transportation methods will 
not be accessible, everyday choices for Mainers.
The Maine Won’t Wait Climate Action Plan reports: “Transportation is responsible 
for 54% of Maine’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. To meet our 
emissions-reductions goals by 2030 and 2050, our state must pivot to the future by 
pursuing aggressive transition strategies and innovative solutions within this 
important sector.”
To reach our climate action goals as a state, we must promote low-carbon 
transportation solutions such as passenger rail.
As a young person who cares deeply about the future of this state and the wellbeing of
people who live here, I urge you to act now to create better transportation access and 
meet our carbon reduction goals. Thank you.
Respectfully submitted, 
Emily Weyrauch
