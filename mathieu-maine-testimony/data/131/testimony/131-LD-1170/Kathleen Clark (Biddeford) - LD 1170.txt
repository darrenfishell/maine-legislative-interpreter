Hi!
My name is Kathleen Clark. I live in Biddeford, Maine. I grew up in Bangor, Maine, 
but spent most of my adult years thus far living in major cities—Austin, TX and 
Brooklyn, NY. For ten years of my life I got by without ever needing to own a car. I 
rode buses, trains, bikes, and walked in order to get everywhere I needed to go. I 
could grocery shop, commute to work, pick up things at a hardware store, go to the 
doctor, etc without ever needing to use a car. 
I chose to come back to Maine to be closer to my family, closer to nature, and to live 
in a democratic state with a strong relationship to the environment and activism for 
climate change. However, in actually living here again, it shocks me how little I can 
do in life without a car. While public transportation exists, it rarely lines up with the 
timeframes needed for travel. It’s the most obvious way to reduce carbon emissions, 
prevent car accidents and unnecessary pedestrian deaths. It’s a given in major cities, 
and as the Portland area grows in popularity and population we need to embrace it in 
massive numbers. 
I absolutely love taking the train from Saco to Portland. It’s quick, it’s cheap, I can do
work while I travel. But I can’t use it at the start of a workday. Sometimes I take it in 
the evening to go for entertainment, but there’s no train to get me back home at the 
end of the night. With more frequent trips, and commuter focused hours, it’d be easier
to integrate it into my daily life.
Please please please consider this development. It’s truly what the Portland area 
needs.
Thanks!
