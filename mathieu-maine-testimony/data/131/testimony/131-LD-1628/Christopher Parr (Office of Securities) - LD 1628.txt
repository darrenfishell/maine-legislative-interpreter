RE:  LD 1586 –  An Act to Enable Occupational License Portability and Prohibit Use of Good Character 
Qualifications in Occupational Licensing  
LD 1628  - An Act to Reform the Occupational Licensing Regime by Including Portability 
and Removing Good Character Requirements  
  
Dear Senator Curry , Representative Roberts , and M embers of the Committee : 
I am writing to express my opposition to LD 1586 and LD 1628 f or the reasons set forth below.  
In the event that either of these bills move forward, I respectfully request that occupations regulated 
by the Office of Securities be specifically excepted. 
The mission of the Maine Office of Securities is to protect Maine investors through fair and 
balanced regulation of the securities industry.   We accomplish that mission, in part, by utilizing a 
uniform national system of licensure for all applicants.  The existing licensing system uses  uniform 
examination a nd licensing standards  to license securities professionals  in Maine and across the 
country.  Under the existing system, a pplicants  can submit a single application for licensure in 
multiple jurisdictions , demonstrate passing scores on examinations (also an automated process), 
pay the appropriate fees, and , for most  applicants, receive almost immediate licensure.  
In 2022, the Office of Securities received 40,201 applications for licensure as a broker -dealer 
agent, and the Office automatically licensed 36,416 of those individuals.  Additionally, another 
3,253 licenses were issued within 24 -48 hours  of submission  to applicants  whose licensing history 
required additional review.   Of the 40,201 applications, only 87 applications required any 
significant  additional scrutiny.

 The title s of the bills before you suggest that their intent is , in part,  to provide relief to  individuals 
who would like to work in Maine , but who are discouraged by the  occupational licensing process.  
I can say with confidence that no suc h problem exists in the securities industry in Maine.  In  2021,  
there were 612,457 individuals licensed nation ally with the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (“FINRA”) as broker -dealer agents, and 149,636 of those agents were licensed in Maine.  
With  Maine’s population being approximately 1.35 million, t hat means there was  nearly  one 
broker -dealer agent licensed in the state for every 9 Maine residents.  These numbers reflect that 
the demand to be licensed in the securities industry in Maine is high and that people are getting 
licensed  expeditiously.     
The current national securities licensing system utilized in Maine is highly functioning and 
efficient, and I believe the measures proposed by LD 1586 and LD 1628 threaten to disrupt that 
system, potentially at great cost.  Thus , I encourage the C ommittee to vote ought not to pass or, in 
the alternative, include an exception for those regulated by the Office of Securities.   
Thank you for your kind consideration. 
Sincerely,  
       
Judith M. Shaw, Esq. 
Acting Securities Administrator
