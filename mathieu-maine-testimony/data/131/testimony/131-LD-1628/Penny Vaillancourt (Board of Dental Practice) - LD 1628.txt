LD 1586  “An Act to Enable Occupational License Portability and Prohibit the Use of Good 
Character Qualifications in Occupational Licensing”  
 LD 1628 “An Act  to Reform the Occupational Licensing Regime by Including Portability and 
Removing Good Character Requirements ” 
 
Dear Senator Curry , Representative Roberts , and Members of the Committee:  
 
The Maine Board of Dental Practice (“the Board”) is in opposition to LDs 1586 and 1628 as there is an 
existing statutory framework for the Board  to issue licenses without delay to individuals who are licensed 
and/or credentialed in another jurisdiction .  Those pathways are identified as “endorsement” and 
“temporary” licensure, which are described below in more detail:  
 
1. Endorsement licensure pathway : 32 M.R.S. §18347 and Board Rules Chapter 11 are the current 
licensure regulations authoriz ing the Board to grant licensure to an individual who holds an active, 
valid license in another jurisdiction. The Board delegates the daily review and approval of licensure 
applications to board staff to avoid unnecessary delays and/or barriers to licensure.  Generally 
speaking, once all the application materials have been submitted and reviewed by board staff a 
licensee will be issued within days.  
 
2. Temporary licensure pathway : 10 M.R.S. §8003(5)(G) and various licensure chapters (Board Rules 
Chapters 2, 5 an d 6) are the current  licensure regulations authoriz ing the Board to grant temporary 
license to an individual who holds an active, valid license in another state without verification of 
education and examination. The temporary license process is rarely used  as the endorsement licensure 
process is just as efficient and a full, unrestricted license is more desirable than that of a temporary 
license. Again, board staff manages this licensure process daily.  
 
If the intent behind LDs 1586  and 1628  is to remove ad ministrative barriers to license otherwise qualified  
dental professionals who are licensed in another  state or jurisdiction,  then please note that the Board’s 
existing regulations and licensure process accomplish that very goal.   However, if the purpose of  the 
legislation is to grant licensure without the Board’s authority to review an individual’s qualifications, then 
the Board is concerned that both LDs 1586 and 1628 removes its sole purpose  which is to protect the 
public. 1 
 
1 32 M.R.S. § 18321(1) states: “The Board of Dental Practice, as established in Title 5, section 12004‑A, subsection 10, is 
created within this subchapter, its sole purpose being to protect the public health and welfare. The board carries out this

In conclusion, the Board respectfully opposes these licensure bills that appear either duplicative to its 
current licensure regulations  or appears to allow an individual to practice as a dental professio nal in Maine 
without regard to public safety in meeting the minimum standards for licensure as identified in the Dental 
Practice Act.  
 
Again, thank you for the opportunity to submit written comment s on behalf of the Dental Board . I would 
be happy to answ er any questions or provide additional information at  work session.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Penny Vaillancourt

purpose by ensuring that the public is serv ed by competent and honest practitioners and by establishing minimum 
standards of proficiency in the professions regulated by the board by testing, licensing, regulating and disciplining 
practitioners of those regulated professions.”
