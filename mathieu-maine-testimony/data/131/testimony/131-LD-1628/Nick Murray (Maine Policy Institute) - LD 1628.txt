Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1586
and
LD
1628,
“An
Act
to
Reform
the
Occupational
Licensing
Regime
by
Including
Portability
and
Removing
Good
Character
Requirements”
Senator
Curry,
Representative
Roberts,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Innovation,
Development,
Economic
Advancement
and
Business,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1586
and
LD
1628.
Maine’s
occupational
licensing
regime
is
unnecessarily
stifling
to
those
who
move
here
to
practice
their
preferred
profession.
Five
years
ago,
Jacob
Posik,
my
colleague
at
Maine
Policy,
documented
the
costs
of
the
many
state
occupational
licensing
regimes.
These
range
from
fees,
to
paperwork,
educational
requirements,
to
wasted
time
waiting
for
the
bureaucracy
to
catch
up
with
one’s
application,
all
to
simply
begin
working
in
one’s
field
of
expertise.
1
In
a
2015
report,
the
Department
of
the
Treasury
stated:
“There
is
evidence
that
licensing
requirements
raise
the
price
of
goods
and
services,
restrict
employment
opportunities,
and
make
it
more
difficult
for
workers
to
take
their
skills
across
state
lines.
Too
often,
policymakers
do
not
carefully
weigh
these
costs
and
benefits
when
making
decisions
about
whether
or
how
to
regulate
a
profession
through
licensing.”
This
statement
is
still
true
today.
Licensing
requirements
are
not
harmful
to
everyone.
Entrenched
industries
benefit
greatly
from
keeping
new
practitioners
out
of
the
marketplace
and
suppressing
competition.
Often,
licensing
has
more
to
do
with
imposing
costly
and
time-consuming
obstacles
that
slow
down
competitors
than
with
ensuring
competence
or
safety
on
behalf
of
the
public.
Don’t
take
my
word
for
it.
Commissioner
Anne
Head
of
the
Department
of
Professional
and
Financial
Regulation
testified
against
a
bill
last
session
to
establish
a
new
license
for
general
contractors,
noting
that,
“Occupational
licensing
laws
across
states
create
barriers
for
individuals
looking
to
enter
the
labor
market
and
they
make
it
harder
for
workers
to
relocate
across
state
lines.”

This
issue
is
the
exact
one
LD
1586
and
LD
1628
aim
to
solve.

On
the
topic
of
ensuring
consumer
safety,
Commissioner
Head
testified
in
regards
to
that
same
bill,
that
“If
there
is
an
issue
of
fraud,
a
licensing
board
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
issue.”

Maintaining
strict
state
licensing
standards
unnecessarily
raises
costs
for
both
entrepreneurs
and
their
customers.
LD
1586
and
LD
1628
would
provide
a
commensurate
license
for
those
who
have
held
an
occupational
license
in
good
standing
in
another
state
for
at
least
a
year,
a
relevant
private
certification
for
two
years,
or
demonstrated
three
years
of
appropriate
work
experience
in
similarly
good
standing.
With
this
bill,
these
hard-working
Mainers
will
be
able
to
begin
to
contribute
and
earn
a
living
here,
doing
what
they
do
best
to
provide
value
for
their
neighbors.
It
is
estimated
that
today
Maine
licenses
more
than
200
individual
occupations
at
a
cost
of
29,206
jobs
and
$276
million
in
annual
economic
output.

Researchers
have
also
concluded
that
Maine’s
licensing
programs
have
resulted
in
a
misallocation
of
resources
of
approximately
$2.6
billion,
or
$4,719
per
Maine
household.
5
Considering
how
difficult
politicians
have
made
it
to
retain
an
income
(with
the
highest
tax
rate
in
New
England
for
single-filers
earning
up
to
$100,ooo
per
year
6
)
and
afford
the
high
cost
of
living
in
Maine
(15%
higher
than
the
national
average
7
),
this
Legislature
should
do
all
it
can
to
remove
barriers
to
earning
a
living.
Please
deem
LD
1586
or
LD
1628
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
clear
the
path
for
Mainers
to
work
in
their
preferred
profession
without
unneeded
and
onerous
barriers.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
