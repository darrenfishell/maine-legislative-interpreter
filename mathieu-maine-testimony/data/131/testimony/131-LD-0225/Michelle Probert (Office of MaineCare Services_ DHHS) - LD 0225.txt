Re:  LD 225 – An Act to Expand the Reimbursement to Hospitals for Days Awaiting Placement 
in Facilities  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
Thank you with the opportunity to share our opposition  to LD 225, An Act to Expand the 
Reimbursement to Hospitals for Days Awaiting Placement in Facilities . This bill requires the 
Department  to provide reimbursement to hospitals other than critical access hospitals for each 
day after the 10th day that a MaineCare -eligible individual is in the care of a hospital while 
awaiting placement in a nursing facility or residential care facility. Th is bill also removes the 
provision that repeals the current law on De cember 31, 2023 . 
 
The Department opposes th e amended version of this  bill that removes the $500,000 cap  on 
General Fund and federal dollars for each year . This change will require MaineCare rulemaking 
and approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servic es. 
 
The Department also opposes this bill as it introduces changes to current rate reimbursement 
methodology, undermining the rate reform process and principles established last year in P.L. 
2021, Ch. 639, which was passed in the last legis lature as LD 1867, An Act to Codify MaineCare 
Rate System Reform . The intent behind that bill was to establish “… a rate -setting system for the 
development and maintenance of MaineCare payment models … to be consistent with 
efficiency, economy, and quality  of care; that are adequate to support MaineCare member access 
to services; and that are equitable and data -driven.”  
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel  free to contact me.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director  
MaineCare Services
