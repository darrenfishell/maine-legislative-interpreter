Good Afternoon, Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and esteemed 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local 
Government. 
I am Representative Rachel Henderson, and I have the honor of serving 6 
communities in Oxford county in the Maine House. I am here to speak in 
support of LD 269. 
There are many reasons why I believe designating Granitic Pegmatite as 
the Maine State Rock is a worthwhile endeavor: 
1) This rock type hosts the Maine State Mineral: Tourmaline. Blue, blue 
green and pink.

Geology V 
2) Granitic Pegmatite is ubiquitous in Maine, as it is found in at least 14 
of Maine’s 16 counties. 
3) Maine has a long history of Industry surrounding granitic pegmatites. 
Mining, which began in the mid-1800s in the Topsham and 
Georgetown region and continuing to this day, with mineral shops 
and a cottage industry of gem cutting. There is also an entire 
museum in Maine that preserves and presents that history: The 
Maine Mineral & Gem Museum. 
4) These deposits also foster outdoor recreation and tourism in Maine for 
individuals and families interested in “rock hounding ” and mineral 
collecting. 
5) Significant scientific work has been done and is being done to 
understand the origin of Maine’s pegmatites.

6) Pegmatites have continually brought Maine international recognition: 
a. The first discovery of gem tourmaline in North America was at Mt 
Mica, Paris in 1820. 
b. Many well-known tourmaline discoveries have been made at 
quarries in Maine including the Dunton quarry (Newry), Mt. 
Apatite (Auburn), Havey quarry (Poland). 
c. The Roebling apatite from the Pulsifer Quarry, Auburn, is 
displayed at the Smithsonian institution. 
d. The 30 foot long beryl crystals from the Bumpus Quarry, in 
Albany, have been officially qualified as “Excellent - world 
class for species or very significant. 
e. Last but not least the over 30ft long spodumene crystals from 
Plumbago North, Newry, Maine. 
7) Some of these pegmatites in Maine host economic quantities of 
spodumene, a mineral resource that is essential to the development 
of Li-ion batteries. 
Thank you committee members for your time, and l would be happy to 
answer any questions you may have for me.
