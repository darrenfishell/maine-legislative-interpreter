LOCAL GOVERNMENT  
IN SUPPORT OF  LD 269 
An Act to Designate Granitic Pegmatite as the Maine State Rock  
FEBRUARY  14, 202 3 
 
Senator Nangle , Representative Stover , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State 
and Local Government , my name is Stephen Dickson , and I am the State Geologist and Director 
of the Maine Geological Survey  (MGS).  I am speak ing on behalf of the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry  (DACF)  in favor of LD 269, An Act to Designate 
Granitic Pegmatite as  the Maine State Rock .  
 
This bill would be the first to designate a Maine state rock.   Other states commonly have a s tate 
rock,  but none have identified granitic pegmatite  that I am aware of.   In Maine, pegmatite is 
common across the state and easily recognizable in a field or classroom setting.  
 
The Maine State Mineral Tourmaline , which has been in statute for over 200 years, comes from 
pegmatite.   Pegmatites are a source of gemstones  and are used in Maine -made jewelry , including 
the Josephine Peary necklace and the Maine State necklace.  
 
Maine has world -class examples of pegmatites  worthy of both scientific and economic 
recognition .  In the 1800s , the mineral feldspar , found in pegmatites,  was actively quarried in 
Maine.   Pegmatites are host rocks to several minerals containing important elements , including 
lithium.  
 
The Maine Geological Survey has many web pages, reports, and geological maps describing 
pegmatites.   If granitic pegmatite becomes the state rock, we will certainly post a web page 
featuring it, as we have done for the state fossil , Pertica quadrifaria . 
 
Thank you  for your time.  I would be happy to  answer any questions now or at the work session.
