Good afternoon, Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and honorable members 
of the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government. My name is Tom 
Hoffelder, I live in Norway (Maine), and I am the president of the Oxford County 
Mineral & Gem Association. The group was founded 75 years ago in 1948, partly 
because of the extensive pegmatite localities in southern Oxford County. 
My wife and l began collecting rocks and minerals in 1987 while living in 
Oklahoma. We lived there and California for a total of eleven years, and even 
"way out west," there was always buzz about tourmaline in Maine. What we and 
most others didn't realize was that you can't have tourmaline without pegmatite. 
ln 1999, a work-related move found us in Connecticut. It wasn't long before we 
were spending weekends in Maine pegmatite quarries. And not just for 
tourmaline. Pegmatite is the most amazing rock on Earth. lt is an igneous rock,a 
magma, the same as granite, but because pegmatite cools so much slower than 
granite, the crystals of the minerals are much larger, even gigantic. Also, there 
are many minerals, some important ones as sources of very desirous elements, in 
pegmatite. 
After retiring, the logical move, for us, not everyone, seemed to be north to 
Maine, and so here we are, after eleven years. l want to give you the perspective 
of someone who is not an expert. I am an amateur geologist, among other 
sciences, all of which exemplify the natural world. Maine has many attributes 
that Ô¨Åt that category. Granitic pegmatite is the rarest.
