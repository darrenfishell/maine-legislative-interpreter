LD# 269 - An Act to Designate Granitic Pegmatite as the Maine State Rock
Dear Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, and the entire State and Local Government Committee, 
On behalf of the Geological Society of Maine members of the Executive Council 
submit this testimony in favor of LD#269 An Act to Designate Granitic Pegmatite as 
the Maine State Rock.
The Geological Society of Maine is a non-profit organization dedicated to geological 
issues and education in Maine. The Society’s membership—over 150 members— 
includes teachers, students, working geologists, aspiring geologists, retired geologists,
and other interested persons.
Our membership sees this effort as a unique educational opportunity to help our 
legislators and fellow constituents learn about geology in the state of Maine. We 
acknowledge that granitic pegmatites have a long history of mining and quarrying in 
the state (over 200 years), and they are the host rock for the Maine state mineral: 
Tourmaline. 
As geologists, we know that granitic pegmatite is common in many of Maine’s public 
lands, and they are easily recognizable to the public. We also understand that many of
the pegmatites found in Maine are unique in the context of broader Appalachian 
geology and appreciate the geologic processes that took hundreds of millions of years 
to produce these rocks. 
We hope that LD#269 promotes a productive dialogue and enhances public 
understanding about the rock type, Granitic Pegmatite, and its significance in the state
of Maine.
Sincerely,
Myles Felch, President
