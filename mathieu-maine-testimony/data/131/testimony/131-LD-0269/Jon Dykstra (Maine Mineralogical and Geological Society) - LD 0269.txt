My name is Jon Dykstra.  I am a retired Geologist residing on the southern coast of 
Maine.  I grew up summers on the Maine coast, and my love of geology began as a 
teenager when a Geologist friend of the family brought me to visit a small rose quartz 
pegmatite in Kennebunkport.  The rose quartz was interesting, but when I discovered 
a large terminated crystal of black tourmaline nested in a block of snow white 
feldspar – I was hooked!
I received my PhD in Economic Geology from Dartmouth College in 1978. After a 37 year 
career in the geologic and mapping sciences, my wife and I returned to back to Maine.  For 
the past four years I have served as the Treasurer of the Maine Mineralogical and Geological 
Society, located in Portland, ME.  The Society’s charter is centered around the education of 
our adult and youth members, all of whom are avid rock-hounds.  In some states, 
rock-hounds focus on hunting fossils, panning for gold, or finding metamorphic minerals.  
Here, in the State of Maine, rock-hounds have one focus – pegmatites!  
The granitic pegmatites of Maine have played an important role in the economics and identity 
of our State.  During the late 1800’s up through WW II, the pegmatites of Oxford sourced 
feldspar and mica to US manufacturers of both commercial and defense products.  Now, not 
only are they a source of rare gem quality tourmaline and beryl, they also have the potential 
to provide a significant source of Lithium – a key element in moving Maine, and the world, into
a greener, less carbon-dependent environment.
I can think of no other rock that would be better suited to represent the State of Maine.
