I have worked for DHHS for 38yrs. Pineland 1983-1988; 1989-1994.
Aroostook Residential Center 1994-1998.
Crisis Services 1998-2023. 
Incidents below occurred while providing Crisis Services:
- I was assaulted (bruised breast, shirt torn off, face hit and scratched numerous times,
head punched numerous times and hair pulled out). Agency staff were afraid of 
getting hurt so they called 911 and stayed outside the room watching. Physical 
therapy to due neck injury and pinched nerve. I have to do neck exercises regularly.  
- Responded to consumer who was intoxicated, suicidal and had a gun. Supervisor did
not agree to let me call the police for assistance, fortunately consumer and myself 
were not harmed. 
- Visited a home to assess safety for consumer and was met with 2 dogs who would 
have liked to attack me and homeowner took their time getting the dogs under control 
(no physical injury but it was very unsettling). 2 co-workers were with me but were 
afraid to go in the house. They told me that they were listening outside and were 
prepared to call the police if they thought I was being attacked.
- Threatened with sexual assault (very explicit) but co-worker called 911 and police 
arrived in time.
- Very explicit threats were made to me on how the consumer would kill me and 
anger/threats increased when I moved around the coffee table to avoid him. Consumer
had past charges of assault but due to brain injury could not be incarcerated. 2nd staff 
was in area and arrived in time so no physical harm was done.
There have been other incidents but I prefer to not think about any more unsafe 
situations.
