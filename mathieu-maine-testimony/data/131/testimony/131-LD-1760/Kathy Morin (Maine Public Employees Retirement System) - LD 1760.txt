SUBIECT Testlmony on L D 1760 - An Act to Include Certa1n Cr1s1s Outreach and Cr1s1s 
__ Sery1ces Workers Under the 1998 Spec1al Plan for Retlrement 
Good afternoon, Senator T1pp1ng, Representat1ve Roeder, and members of the ]o1nt Standlng 
Commlttee on Labor and Hous1ng My name 1s Kathy Morln, and I am the D1rector of 
Actuarial and Leglslatlve Affalrs for the Mame Publ1c Employees Retlrement System 
Ma1nePERS 1s ne1ther for nor agalnst L D 1760 We are here to pI‘0V1Cl€ mformatlon and offer 
any ass1stance the Commlttee m1ght need regardmg th1s b1ll 
State employees are covered by e1ther a "regular plan" or a ”spec1al plan " The ma]or1ty of 
state employees are covered by the regular plan, which perm1ts retlrement after twenty-f1ve 
years of serv1ce and/ or attamment of normal ret1rement age of 60, 62 or 65 Spec1al plans 
typ1cally allow for ret1rement w1th fewer years of serv1ce and/ or at a younger age Because of 
the more favorable prov1s1ons of the speclal plans, they are more expenslve to fund 
All employees 1n the Department of Health and Human Servlces are covered by the regular 
plan L D 1760 would move certa1n employees, spec1f1cally cr1s1s outreach and cr1s1s servlces 
workers as deﬁned 1n the b1ll, 1nto the 1998 Spec1al Plan effect1ve October 1, 2023, and would 
apply retroactlvely to 1nclude all covered serv1ce 1n the spec1al plan Under th1s plan, 
part1c1pants become el1g1ble to ret1re 1n one of two ways 1) by accrumg 25 years of serv1ce 1n 
a covered capac1ty, or 2) by accru1ng 10 years under the 1998 Spec1al Plan and atta1n1ng age 
55 Under the f1rst prov1s1on, all serv1ce 1n a covered capac1ty 1s counted towards meetlng the 
25-year requ1rement wh1le under the second prov1s1on, only serv1ce earned 1n a covered 
capac1ty after the date that a spec1f1c group 1s mcluded 1n the plan 1s counted towards meet1ng 
the 10 year requ1rement 
Th1s b1ll Wlll have a f1scal lmpact because the Const1tut1on does not allow the creat1on of new 
or add1t1onalbenef1ts unless 1mmed1ately and fully funded New beneflts are created under 
L D 1760 because covered employees would be able to retlre earl1er and w1th a hlgher benef1t, 
and therefore would rece1ve beneﬁts in excess of those currently accounted for and funded, 
creatlng a new unfunded actuarlal l1ab1l1ty (UAL)

Dunng the 130“ Leg1slature, the Commlttee cons1dered L D 1041, wh1ch was amended to 
mclude the same proposal as L D 1760 At that tlme, Ma1nePERS estlmated the cost for the 
plan change to be approxlmately $102,000 1n rncreased UAL, for the 1nd1v1duals then 1dent1f1ed 
to be lmpacted by that b1ll There would also be an mcrease to the ongolng employer and 
member normal costs for the employees covered by th1s b1ll Ma1nePERS w1ll work wlth the 
Department and the Offlce of Flscal and Program Revlew to ldentlfy the 1nd1v1duals covered 
by th1s proposal and to determlne the costs assoclated wlth amendlng the ret1rement plan 
coverage for th1s group of employees 
Ma1nePERS has one concern about the way L D 1760 1s drafted Specrﬁcally, the b11l as 
proposed permlts lmpacted employees to elect whether to move 1nto the new plan Plan 
coverage elect1ons 1n a qual1f1ed plan are not perm1tted by the Internal Revenue Serv1ce 
Ma1nePERS would recommend that 1n order to avo1d a plan c0mpl1ance rssue, the b1l1 be 
amended to move all employees 1n the covered pos1t1ons 1nto the new plan 
Thank you for your conslderatlon of tlus testlmony I would be happy to answer your 
questlons and W111 be avallable at your work sesslon
