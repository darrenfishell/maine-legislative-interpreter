My testimony: 
As a neighboring resident of the State of New Hampshire, I am submitting my 
opposition to this legislation to become an act of law.
This in my opinion would be no different if narcotics became illegal for a minor in 
our state to become legal for a minor in your state to partake in your state, and the 
parents have no recourse to say no, would be contributing to the delinquency of a 
minor.   Minor children at a whim can pretend to be what ever they want as a child, 
but the reality of this they were born how God sought to have them live.  While this 
can be debated, the mental acuity of a minor calls into question, if this is merely 
exploiting and trafficking children to your state,  Human trafficking is a problem, and 
this act, is further allowing that to continue, and is being encouraged, which is wrong. 
Please ITL this act, and save our children from being exploited.
