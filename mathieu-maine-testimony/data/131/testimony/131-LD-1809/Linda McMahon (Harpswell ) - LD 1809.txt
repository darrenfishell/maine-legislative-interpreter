LD 1809
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the joint 
committee for judiciary 
I support LD 1809. This bill requires parental consent and the provision of parental 
notification before a minor can obtain treatment for all health care services.
Since parents are ultimately held legally, financially responsible for a child’s 
well-being, children should not be given medical services without parents’ knowledge
and consent. If this proposal is passed, it makes fragile and impressionable children 
more vulnerable to influencers and groomers.
Please vote “ought to pass.” Thank you.
