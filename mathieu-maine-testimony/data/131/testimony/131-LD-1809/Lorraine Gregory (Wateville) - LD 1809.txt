LD 1809
I am writing in support of LD 1809, HP 1154:  AN ACT TO PROHIBIT HEALTH 
CARE SERVICES WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT
Parental involvement is required and encouraged in other less permanent decisions in 
a young person's life, i.e., purchasing tickets to an R-rated movie; going on a field trip
or even signing a modeling contract.  This law would align those wise policy 
decisions with the situation faced by an unplanned pregnancy.
While some may bring up a possible situation of an abusive or neglecting parent, our 
public policy decisions are not and should not be based on "what ifs".
Abortion is a life changing decision that has devastating consequences, and for this 
reason I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1809
