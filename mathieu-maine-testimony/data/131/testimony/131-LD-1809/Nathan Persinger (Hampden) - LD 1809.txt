LD 1809
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1809. It is an absolute necessity that parents 
are involved in their child's health care. This is a common sense bill that is right for 
Maine and right for Maine children. It is outright dangerous for children to receive 
medical care without the consent and support of their parents. The children belong to 
their parents, not the schools nor the state.
