Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Mame Corumrttee on 
Jud1c1ary. I am Wendy Memll from Benton. 
I am here to testrfy an support of LD 1197, An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion 
The State of Mame has a powerful duty to ensure a decrsron to abort IS voluntary, 
Wrthout pressure, or coercron. Studies show that up to 60% of women abort 
because of pressure from someone else. (ijgtps //tmyual com/MlCoerca0nBan) A 
Women pressured to abort is not makmg this decrsaon for herself Just last night,a 
woman told me that her husband coerced her into abortmg her last baby by 
threatemng to leave her and their hvmg chrldren. She drd abort, but here she is 40 
years later, lamentmg that she caved to that pressure, stﬂl mourmng the loss of her 
baby, and regretting havmg that abortron. He ended up leavmg her anyway. 
In my role as Executive Dnector of a pregnancy help center, I have walked Wrth 
numerous women through the process of healmg after abortron. Most of those 
women felt coerced to abort then" baby A piece of health rs mental health. Many 
Women suffer from mental health rssues after a coerced abortrort To ignore thrs rs 
nresponsrble and cruel 
If we truly are about Women & women’s nghts, about a woman’s right to choose, 
then we must he domg everythmg we posslbly can to ensure women are making 
ﬂb0Tl10Il decrsrons after they have gathered all the facts, have ample tune to 
process them, and are m no way pressured to end the hfe of then" baby A woman 
who as coerced rs not makmg her own cholce. 
I urge you to vote ‘YES’ to LD ll97, as Well as to LD 494, LD 771, LD 1249, LD 
1614, and LD 1809 Thank you
