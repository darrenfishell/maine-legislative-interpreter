Outside of extreme situations (less than 1%), no healthcare professional has the right 
to carry out procedures without parental consent. A case like this just happened in 
where a minor was taken from her grandparents and put into foster care by the state 
(not ours), the young female was then sexually exploited at two foster homes. She 
was never used as such under the protection of her own family. The state has no 
answer to this and will be found eternally guilty for this. Support this bill
