LD 1809
My name is Rob Poissant. My residence is the town of Gorham.
Thankyou for providing for our testimony today.
I support and urge ought to pass for H.P.1154.
In particular , I affirm that a school counselor , social worker and school board attain 
permission from a parent or legal guardian in order to participate in services.
In particular, an Abortion May not be performed on a minor that is against their will.
Our young people are our future here in Maine. Parents are essential and know what 
is best for their Minor.
Thank You
