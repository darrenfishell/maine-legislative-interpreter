TESTIMONY AGAINST LD 1809 
 
An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental Consent,   
 
 
Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary 
Date:  May 5, 2023 
 
Representative Moonen, Senator Carney and distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is Henry Skinner, MD and 
I am President of the Maine Association of Psychiatric Physicians.  I also serve as Secretary of the Maine Council of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatrists (MCCAP).  Clinically, my roles include Medical Director at Tri-County Mental Health Services and at the 
Aroostook Mental Health Center and at Family Psychiatry of Maine in Yarmouth. Through these organizations, I serve Mainers of all 
ages in every county except York.  
 
It has been longstanding settled law in the State of Maine that youth ages 14 and up are able to independently provide consent for 
outpatient mental health, outpatient substance abuse, and reproductive health services. Such statutes are common across all 50 states.  
 
Sometimes kids get into situations that if their parents found out, there would be abuse or neglect. The law as written protects kids 
who need it. Sometimes kids need reproductive health services because of incest by a parent or guardian (or the parentâ€™s partner). 
Sometimes they need mental health services because of abuse by a parent. Sometimes parents are the ones who get kids started in 
substance abuse. These situations are sadly common. I wish I could assure you that all parents are wise, caring and protective, but 
many parents struggle with these responsibilities. The opioid crisis and the pandemic-associated mental health crisis have exacerbated 
the challenges facing kids and parents alike. 
 
Vulnerable young Mainers need independent access to these services, so they can grow into healthy parents themselves. 
 
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this bill.
