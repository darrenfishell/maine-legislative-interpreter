LD1809 An act to prohibit health care services without parental consent. 
 
When my two boys were in school the school nurse would call me before giving them a Tylenol.  To think 
they could provide family planning services, tr eat a sexually transmi Ʃed disease or provide substance 
abuse treatment due to possession of drugs or alcohol without my consent is uncon Ɵonable.  I’m their 
mother, they are my responsibility and they are my whole heart.  Neither the school nor the government 
love my child to the degree that I do.  When they are happy I am happy, when they are sad I am sad, 
when they get pregnant, high on drugs, raped, I need to know about it, I need to be there for them and 
help them t hru it, not le Ō in the dark , ineﬀecƟve.  Yes there are some really crappy parents out there, 
most do the best they can.  It is not acceptable to take a good parent’s rights away to overcompensate 
for the bad parent.  The school cannot take a parent’s place, the government cannot take the parent’s 
place.   
 
Thank you for your service and a ƩenƟon.  Please vote yes on LD1809.
