LD 1809
I am writing in support of LD 1809. Parents need information about their children in 
order to parent. It is as simple as that. We need not be left out of the loop in life 
changing treatments or information given to our children. Especially in the case of 
abortion, but in all medical procedures or healthcare situations, a parent should be 
involved in the treatment of their minor child.
