Dear Committee Members:
Parents have Rights and no school employee, no matter who that is should withhold 
medical or other pertinent information from the parents.  
The Schools have been given TOO MUCH POWER over the years and need to be 
pulled back.  The schools need to teach the ABC's, Math, Civics, Home Ed, how to 
manage finances, etc., so that the student will have a well rounded education.  
I ask that you vote OUGHT to PASS on this bill.  Thank you.
