LD 1809 - An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental Consent
Position: Support
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Clare Desrosiers, from Linneus, ME. I am submitting testimony in 
Support of LD 1809.
Requiring parental consent and the provision of parental notification before a minor 
can obtain treatment for all health care services is a basic foundation to upholding the 
rights of parents and avoiding evolving into a state that takes over the role of parents.
Health care decisions can be life changing. For example, abortion is a life changing 
decision that has devastating consequences yet Maine does NOT require parental 
consent for abortion, according to Planned Parenthood Maine.

Ironically, parental involvement is required and encouraged in other arguably less 
permanent decisions in a young personâ€™s life. Purchasing tickets to a R-rated movie, 
going on a field trip or even signing a modeling contract. This law would align those 
wise policy decisions with the situation faced by an unplanned pregnancy.
Opponents to this bill often bring up an outlier situation of an abusive or neglecting 
parent. Our public policy decisions are not and should not be based on outlier 
theoreticals. This bill is common sense and would allow parents the right to have 
those important conversations with young adults who benefit from advice from those 
who love and care for them.
Please choose Ought to Pass on LD 1809.
Thank you.
