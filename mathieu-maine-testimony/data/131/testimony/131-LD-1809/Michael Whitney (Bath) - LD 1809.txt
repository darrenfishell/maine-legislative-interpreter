To: The Judiciary Committee 
 
I am writing to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD1809 for the following 
reasons: 
 
1. It is inconceivable that a procedure as invasive and dangerous as an 
abortion should be performed on a minor without parental consent! 
2. Parents are responsible for the welfare of their children NOT the state! 
 
I strongly urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD1809!
