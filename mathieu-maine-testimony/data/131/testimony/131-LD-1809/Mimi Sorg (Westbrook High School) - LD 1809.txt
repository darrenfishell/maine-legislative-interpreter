I have been in the field of educational social work for nearly 25 years. I can not count 
the number of students who have accessed confidential services due to being afraid of
their parent's reaction but were in dire need of services. It would be wonderful if 
every child had a supportive parent, but that is not the reality. Many kids will not 
access support and services without the ability to do so confidentially. With teen 
suicide on the rise, mental health supports limited, and the decline in mental health 
amongst our students taking away confidential services would be detrimental and 
dangerous to a very vulnerable population. Please choose to not prohibit access to 
confidential services without parental consent. Thank you.
