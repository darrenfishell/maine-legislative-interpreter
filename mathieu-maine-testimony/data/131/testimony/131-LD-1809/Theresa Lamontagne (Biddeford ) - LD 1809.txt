It is the absolute duty of every parent to protect their minor children. Our poor young 
people are depressed and often suicidal unfortunately in this society. When children 
make decisions that are not good, who is there to help them ,to pick them back up and
to comfort them. To allow a minor to make such a difficult decision without the 
parents even knowing whatâ€™s going on is unlawful. Please protect our children.
