LD 1809
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
My name is Isabelle Schmidt, from Bowdoin. 
I am writing to speak in support of LD 1809, “An Act to An Act to Prohibit Health 
Care Services Without Parental Consent.”  
Children, particularly those of pre-teen and teen-age years, often get themselves into 
trouble of many natures.  This period in their lives is formative, so they are best cared 
for by their parents or guardians, who are most responsible for them and have a vested
loving interest in their well-being.  There should be no service provided to a student 
by an education institution which prevents the parents from full information thereof 
regarding the status and subsequent treatment of their children by school counselors 
and social workers.  Serious life-changing issues such as alcohol or drug abuse, 
gender dysphoria, sexual or violent activity, pregnancy and abortion, physical 
condition and diagnosed diseases, etc. ought never to be withheld from family 
members responsible for that student.  That is destructive to the family and potentially
dangerous to their child.    
It is lawful that a young person necessarily receives an education, but that 
requirement does not include public services of a personal nature to the student 
without the authority of the minor’s parents or guardians.  
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 1809.  Thank you.
