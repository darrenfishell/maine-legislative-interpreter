Charlis Sullivan
Caribou
LD 1809
Representative Jeffrey Adams and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Charlis Sullivan and I am a resident of Caribou. 
I am here to testify in support of LD 1809, HP1154, An Act to Prohibit Health Care 
Services Without Parental Consent. 
Abortion is a life altering decision that is mentally and physically devastating.
For this reason, I ask the committee to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD1809 and to ensure
parental support is available, particularly in decision making that may adversely 
impact the life of a minor. Thank you.
