Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, 
My name is Keri Kapaldo, and I live In Hampden I ]OII’I you today not only on a personal level but also as a Registered 
Nurse and Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner who has cared for Maine's youth in a medical capacity over the past 15 years 
in a pediatric office, an OB/GYN office, in schools, and in emergency rooms The healthcare I have provided over the 
years has spanned everything in this bill and then some Today I write to you in opposition of LD 1809, “An Act to 
Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental Consent" 
LD 1809 seeks to overturn current laws which protect and promote the emotional and physical wellbeing of minors 
and, instead, wishes to impose mandatory parental or guardian consent for minors accessing critical and often life- 
saving healthcare for mental health, substance use disorders, sexual health and reproductive issues, and sexual 
assault 
In the case of this bill, it is imperative to know that 
e 1 in 3 females and 1 in 4 males will be sexually assaulted between the ages of 11 and 171 , rates of sexual 
violence against youth are on the FISE2 , 93% of child sexual abuse reports to law enforcement are 
committed by someone known to the victim 34% are family members 3 
We cannot leave it in the hands of 
the offender to give consent for a minor to obtain crucial sexual assault services 
v In 2020, Maine ranked highest in the nation for child maltreatment and continues to rise while nationally it 
is decreasing 4 76 8% of perpetrators are parents to their victims, 4% are partners of parents, and 6 8% are 
relatives 5 We cannot leave it in the hands of the perpetrator to consent for a minor to obtain reproductive, 
mental health, and substance use healthcare 
0 Restricting access for Maine's youth to seek mental health and substance use services is an obvious 
contradiction to the Comprehensive Behavioral Health Plan for Maine put forth in the 130"‘ Maine 
Legislature ’ and currently underway A plan put forth to combat the continued and serious rise in 
depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and substance use by Maine's youth 4'2 
0 Two or more Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) increases the likelihood a child will have emotional and 
mental health disturbances, develop substance use disorder, and incur other physical and social detriments 
of health 5 
We cannot leave it in the hands of the person inflicting adverse childhood experiences to 
consent for a minor to obtain mental health, substance use, reproductive, and sexual assault healthcare 
Speaking of adverse childhood experiences, I experienced all ten I was supposed to be nobody, destined for nowhere 
If it weren't for the ability to seek safe, private, and confidential care for my mental health, substance use, reproductive 
health, and sexual assault as an adolescent- I wouldn't be standing here in front of you today If someone prohibited 
my access due to parental consent I wouldn't be here at all 
In closing to require and mandate parental consent for these critical healthcare areas is to create barriers, restrict 
access, and as the title infers PROHIBIT vital healthcare services Outcomes would be detrimental I hope you will 
vote ‘ought not to pass’ on LD 1809
