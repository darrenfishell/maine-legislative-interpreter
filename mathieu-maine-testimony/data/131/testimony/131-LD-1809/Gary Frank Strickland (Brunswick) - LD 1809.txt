Dear Judiciary Committee,
It is sad that there might even be a debate about the merits of this legislation.  Parents 
have the right and responsibility to care for their children.  Schools or any other 
public official does not have the right to make these decisions, they fall squarely on 
the parents' shoulders.  Please support this bill and ensure that children receive the 
care that the state can never give.  Only parents can do this, know the child best, and 
can help their children through the challenges they face growing up.
Please support this commonsense bill.
Sincerely,
G. Frank and Susan R. Strickland
Brunswick, Maine
