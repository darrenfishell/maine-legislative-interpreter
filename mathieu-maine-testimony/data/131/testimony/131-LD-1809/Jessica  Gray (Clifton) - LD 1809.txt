LD 1809
Good afternoon! I would like to testify that I support LD 1809. I feel that that this is 
common sense. Children should not have any sort of medical service without the 
consent of a parent. Period. I do not see any down side to this. In other states this has 
become an issue in the transgender realm. Parents may not agree with the child and 
other affirming adults step in to "help" without the parents. That is one of the most 
disrespectful acts I can think of. Lets take a stand for parental rights. Please vote to 
ought to pass
