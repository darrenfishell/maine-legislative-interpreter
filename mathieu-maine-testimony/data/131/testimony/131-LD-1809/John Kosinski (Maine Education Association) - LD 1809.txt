Testimony 
In Opposition to 
LD 1809: An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental Consent 
John Kosinski, Director of Government Relations, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
May 5, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and other esteemed members of the Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is John Kosinski and I am the Director of Government Relations for the Maine Education 
Association (MEA) The MEA represents 24,000 educators in our public schools including teachers, 
school counselors and social workers in nearly eveiy public school in the state On behalf of the MEA,I 
am here to testify in opposition to LD 1809 An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental 
Consent 
We have many concerns about this bill including Section 1 of the proposal which seeks to change 20-A 
MRSA §4008-A, sub-§2, a relatively new section of law passed by the Legislature in 2019 This new section of law was passed as LD 247, An Act To Increase the Amount of Time School Counselors and 
Social Workers Spend Providing Students Direct and Indirect Counseling and the underlying intent was to make sure school counselors and social workers could focus on their _]0bS — namely, providing help 
and suppoits for students In some cases, school counselors and social workers were being asked to fill 
in for other shortages and to serve as lunch monitors, bus and recess aides, rather than providing the 
supports to students they are trained to provide With recent empirical data and countless anecdotes 
from educators, we know our students need more support Many are struggling with mental health 
challenges - challenges that will slow or inhibit their leaming and healthy development 
Proposed rules for this law are refeired to as Chapter 117 and in fact the Education Comimttee 
conducted a lengthy public hearing and work session a few weeks ago to review the rules The Ch 117 
rules seek to clarify the standards, qualifications, duties, and use of time for both school counselors and 
social workers, but the proposed change in this section requires school counselors and social workers to 
obtain consent before providing services to students, which would significantly limit these professionals 
in performing their duties The implications of this would be dangerous, especially given the behavioral 
and academic challenges our students face 
The bill goes on to require parental consent before schools can provide a host of other mental health and 
behavioral supports mcluding substance abuse counseling and counseling for “emotional and 
psychological problems ” Do you have any idea how many students face “emotional problems ” in the 
course of any /given school day in our state‘? These sections of law will have a chilhng effect What isa 
school to do if a student is having an emotional or psychological breakdown, in school, yet the parents
