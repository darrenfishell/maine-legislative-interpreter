 
LD 1809  
An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services  
Without Parental Consent  
Presented by Rep. Jeffrey Adams  
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on Judiciary,  
My name is Abigail Beal of Cherryfield, Maine.  Thank you for the opportunity to testify.  
I urge you to SUPPORT LD 1809 , An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental 
Consent.  
It only makes sense that if children need parental consent to purchase R -rated movie tickets, 
parental consent should certa inly be required for abortion services.  
This bill is common sense. It would allow parents the right to have important conversations 
with young adults who benefit from advice from those who love and care for them the most.  
If you want what’s best for young ladies, their babies, and their families, please vote “Ought to 
Pass” on LD 1809.  Thank you for your time.
