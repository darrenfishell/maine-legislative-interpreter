Janet LeBlanc
Waterville
LD 1809
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Janet LeBlanc and I am a resident of 
Waterville. I am testifying in support of LD 1809.
The responsibility of taking care of children belongs to the parents.  This bill requires 
parental consent and parental notification for some services.  It is common sense that 
parents should be told if her/his child has been sexually assaulted and needs to have a 
sexual assault forensic examination.  They should be told if their child is violating 
school substance use policies.   The more parents knows the better they can help their 
children.  LD 1809 creates an atmosphere for parents to have a dialogue with their 
children about the difficulties their children are facing.  Parents should never be shout 
out of the lives of their children by school, medical or other officials.
