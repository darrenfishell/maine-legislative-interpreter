Dear Chairs Senator Carney and Representative Moonen and ALL Judiciary 
Committee Members:
My name is Susan Neale, and I am a resident of Brunswick. I am submitting written 
testimony For Ought To Pass (YES VOTE) for: LD 1809
The Maine Legislature can better serve the common good by prioritizing policies that 
comprehensively assist women, children and families in need in ways that will not 
only encourage childbirth but make it easier to WELCOME and RAISE and new 
baby. 
Therefore, I am urging you to vote Ought To PASS on  the above mentioned bill for 
the State of Maine.
