Kelly Coffin
Clinton
LD 1809
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee. My name is Kelly Coffin from 
Clinton. I am requesting an ought to pass vote for LD1809. It,s always in the best 
interest of children to have their parents involved in any decision-making process in 
cases of life altering situations and anything to do with healthcare. Its good old 
common sense which seems to be lacking today.  Thank you.
