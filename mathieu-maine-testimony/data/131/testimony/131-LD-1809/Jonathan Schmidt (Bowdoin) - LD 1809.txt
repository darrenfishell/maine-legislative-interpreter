Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary.  My name is Jon Schmidt, I am a resident of Bowdoin, and I am 
submitting this testimony to express my SUPPORT for LD 1809. 
I support LD 1809  because its provisions, in combination with several other pro-life bills 
currently under consideration, will help to restore common sense safeguards and necessary 
restraint to Maine’s permissive abortion laws.   
The natural and traditional responsibility and authority of parents and legal guardians to 
care for and protect their children must be supplanted by extrafamilial entities only under 
the most exceptional circumstances.  Parental involvement in decisions regarding their 
minor children’s physical and mental health is particularly essential.  Conversely, it is 
entirely inappropriate that counseling and treatment for such serious matters as substance 
abuse, sexual assault, psychological problems, or abortion should be conducted without 
parental notification and consent. Doing so undercuts parental authority, builds walls of 
emotional distance and distrust between minor children and their parents, and thrusts 
important, potentially life-changing decisions into the hands of people (minors) who have 
neither the experience, nor perspective, to wisely deal with them. 
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS.. Thank you.
