LD 1809
LD 1809 - An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental Consent 
Addressing the chairman and committee members. 
I am opposing this Act LD1809. The lined out wording is to be left in and the 
additions are terrible. What gives you people the idea that you have the right to 
control the bodies of our children. The parents ARE THE PARENTS, NOT THE 
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES!!! The Governor and her ideas are not for the benefit of the 
youth. The school is to teach reading, writing, math, social studies, "HISTORY AS IT
HAPPENED", science and the basic welfare of society as it has been for generations. 
The people will speak, again!!! ld1809 OUGHT NOT TO PASS
