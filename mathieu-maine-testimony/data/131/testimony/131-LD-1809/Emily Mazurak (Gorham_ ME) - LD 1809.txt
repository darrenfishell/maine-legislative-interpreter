My name is Emily Mazurak and I work as a pediatric nurse both in the Pediatric ICU 
and in the community health setting.
I work with children of all ages, but especially with those in middle and high school.  
Over the past 10 years as a nurse I have seen the need and want of students accessing 
both medical and mental health services.  Many, even without the new restraints of 
this legislation, already have a difficult time accessing services.  I feel certain a law 
requiring parental consent for mental health services, substance use treatment, and 
sexual health services would pose a dangerous barrier to minors seeking critical, 
time-sensitive healthcare.  
Requiring parental consent for mental health services, substance use treatment, and 
sexual health services puts adolescent lives in danger.  We need trusted healthcare 
providers who can help youth in their most vulnerable moments seek healthcare 
without additional barriers to delay critical care.  
Sincerely,
Emily E Mazurak RN, BSN, CCRN, MPH
