LD 1809
Sen Carney, Rep. Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Renee Fortin, I live in Lewiston
I am writing in support of LD 1197, An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion -
Summary: This bill amends the laws governing informed consent to abortion by 
requiring a health care professional, prior to performing an abortion, to provide to a 
pregnant minor or pregnant patient orally and in writing, in a language and manner 
that will be understood by the patient:
1.Notice that the minor or patient has the right to withdraw consent for an abortion at 
any time before the performance of the abortion and, if so, to receive a refund of any 
payments made to the health care professional for the performance of the abortion.
2. Notice that the law prohibits criminal threatening of any person, including a person 
who refuses to have an abortion.
3. Contact information for providers of resources for victims of domestic violence, 
including the telephone number of at least one domestic violence hotline and one 
sexual assault hotline; an offer to make referrals to law enforcement agencies and 
domestic violence and sexual assault support organizations; and an offer to call a law 
enforcement agency if the patient or minor feels that the patient or the minor will be 
unsafe if the patient or the minor refuses to have an abortion.
4.Information regarding the Maine Human Rights Act's protections against 
discrimination in employment, education, and housing on the basis of pregnancy or 
familial status and, upon request, provide
educational materials prepared by the Maine Human Rights Commission regarding 
these protections.
Reason for Support: This bill is a straightforward requirement for additional notice 
and information to be provided to any woman seeking an abortion. Itâ€™s common sense
with any serious medical procedure to have notice of rights and risks related to that 
procedure.
