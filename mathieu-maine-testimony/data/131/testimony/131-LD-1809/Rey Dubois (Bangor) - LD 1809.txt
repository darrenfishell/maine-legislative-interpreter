I love them all Three dred by spontaneous abortlon, wh1ch1s more humanely 
called mrscarrrage, and one dred by electrve abortlon I told you that that 
abortron was the worst dec1s1on that I have made 1n my l1fe and one thatI 
have regretted for 40 years 
I have 5 daughters who are ahve and doing welll They have made me proud, 
and I can ﬁll your day tellmg you how they've made a drfference 1n the 
world As the father of my chrldren, I have a specral bond wrth them and no 
one 1n th1s world can touch 1t I would dre for my chrldren 
It was my _]0b to teach them therr morals (prrmarrly by example) and to make 
dec1s1ons regardrng therr safety, health, and well berng untrl they were 18, 
although I contrnued to provrde sometrmes unwelcomed advrce after that 
pornt I d1d my best to rarse my chrldren correctly, and no one m th1s world 
should be allowed to supercede me 1n my ab1l1ty, and actual respons1b1l1ty, to 
drrect my chrldren No one should be able to be a surrogate who can make 
dec1s1ons for my chrldren or to counsel them 1n ways contrary to how I would 
counsel them I am the1r father and I love them School ofﬁcrals and abortron 
clmic employees mrght thrnk they know what 1s best for my krds but they do
