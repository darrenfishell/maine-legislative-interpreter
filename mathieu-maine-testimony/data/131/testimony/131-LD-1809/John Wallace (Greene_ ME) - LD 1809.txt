LD 1809
I support LD 1809. This bill requires parental consent and the provision of parental 
notification before a minor can obtain treatment for all health care services. 
Abortion is a life changing decision that has devastating consequences. It only makes 
sense that such an important decision be discussed with parent(s) who are responsible 
for their children and are in a position to offer counsel and support.
