LD 1809 An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental Consent 
Public Testimony —Ought Not to Pass 
First, I would like to thank the chairs Senator Carney and Representative Moonen 
along with the rest of the Committee on Judiciary for hearing my testimony 
today. My name is Aspen Ruhlin, and I am here as a representative of Mabel 
Wadsworth Center in Bangor. We are a feminist sexual and reproductive health 
center that provides a wide range of services, including abortion care, prenatal 
care, STI testing and treatment, gender-af ﬁrming hormone therapy, and primary 
care services. We are here today to urge you to vote “ought not to pass” on LD 
1809. 
There is unfortunately not a polite way to say that this bill 1S not only a gross 
infringement on the rights and bodily autonomy of Maine’s youth, but alsoa 
public health nightmare. Prior to my work at Mabel Wadsworth Center, I worked 
under a CDC contract as the Northern Maine HIV, STD, and Hepatitis C 
Community Outreach Coordinator. While there should be no shame in 
contracting an STI, as getting sick is a very human thing to do, it is an 
unfortunate fact that shame and lack of knowledge drives the higher rates of STIs 
among young people, with those between the ages of 15 and 24 accounting for 
more than half of all sexually transmitted infections ‘ . Requiring youth to have 
parental consent for STI testing or treatment won’t make them not have sex, it 
will simply prevent youth from accessing testing and treatment, either because 
they do not feel comfortable talking with their parent about it or because the 
parent will not allow them to access that care.
