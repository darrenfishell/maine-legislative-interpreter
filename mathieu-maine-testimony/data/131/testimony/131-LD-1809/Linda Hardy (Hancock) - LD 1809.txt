Linda Hardy
Hancock
LD 1809
Dear Judiciary Committee,
My name is Linda Hardy from Hancock, mother of 4 adult children and 10 
grandchildren.
I urge you to support the two proposed laws before you at this hearing, LD1410, and 
LD1809. These are much needed, as society, including the health care and school 
systems have been undermining the family for years. I worked in the school system 
for many years and understand that you hate to lose children through the cracks, 
meaning those from broken homes but in the meantime, children from very caring 
families with strong moral values are being harmed by teaching in direct opposition to
the family much of the time behind the back of the parents.
Please support these bills and vote ought to Pass.
Sincerely,
Linda Hardy
