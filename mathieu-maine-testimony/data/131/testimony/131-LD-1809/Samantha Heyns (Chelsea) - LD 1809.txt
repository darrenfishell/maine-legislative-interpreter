LD 1809
I am writing in favor of LD 1809 An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without 
Parental Consent
Minors cannot go to certain movies, get their ears pierced, or even go on a school 
field trip, without parental consent. It is common sense then to require Health care 
services to get parental consent before treating their children to medical care.
I ask you to vote yes on LD 1809.
Thank you,
