Dear Committee Members:
              2nd Amendment to the Constitution states:
A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the
people to keep an bear arms, shall not be infringed. 
This amendment was passed so that the Government would NOT become tyrannical 
to the people of The United States.  This government is on the fringe of TYRANNY.
We have TOO MANY restrictions on our 2nd Amendment now.  
LEAVE IT ALONE...
