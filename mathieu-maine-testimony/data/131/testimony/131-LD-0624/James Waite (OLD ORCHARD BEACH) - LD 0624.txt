LD 624
I'm writing in support of LD 624, "An Act to Prohibit Government Officials from 
Maintaining Records Related to Firearms Owners."
Four provisions of current federal law prohibit a national registry of most, but not all, 
modern firearms. Two of these prohibitions set limits on the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, while the other two set limits on the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation.
This bill amends state law prohibiting a government agency or a political subdivision 
of the State from keeping a comprehensive registry of privately owned firearms and 
firearms owners to provide that such entities may not keep or cause to be kept a 
record or database of privately owned firearms and the owners of those firearms 
within their jurisdiction that contains sufficient information to establish a connection 
between any individual and any firearm.
Article I, Section 16 of the Maine Constitution states that every citizen has a right to 
keep and bear arms and this right shall never be questioned. I find maintaining any 
form of lists or databases of firearms owners to be a violation of this Constitutionally 
protected natural right. 
I urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 624.
Sincerely, James M Waite
