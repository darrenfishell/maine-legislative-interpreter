Testimony in Support of LD 624
An Act to Prohibit Government Officials from Maintaining Records Related to Firearms Owners 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety :
My name is Nathan Gould, from Winterport. I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 
624, “An Act to Prohibit Government Officials from Maintaining Records Related to Firearms Owners.”
Our laws must be strengthened to prevent law-abiding citizens from being needlessly 
surveilled. I haven’t forgotten the news of data regarding firearms purchases that should have been 
destroyed being illegally kept by the Maine Intelligence Analysis Center in 2020. I accessed the MIAC 
page on May 7, 2023, and at the top of the page in bold letters is an announcement of a data breach1. 
This does not inspire confidence. I do not want them to store sensitive data longer than necessary, nor
more data than necessary. Please protect the dignity of citizens and prevent further hampering and 
harassing of those who wish to exercise their Second Amendment rights.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
