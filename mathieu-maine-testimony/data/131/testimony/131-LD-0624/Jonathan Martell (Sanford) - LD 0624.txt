 
LD 624 An Act to Prohibit Government Officials from Maintaining Records Related to Firearms Owners 
  
 
Memorandum of Support  
Date:  May 8, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Criminal Justice and Public Safety.  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 624 An Act to Prohibit Government Officials from Maintaining Records Related to Firearms Owners 
 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of  
LD 624 An Act to Prohibit Government Officials from Maintaining Records Related to Firearms Owners. 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. I am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member.  
 
This bill simply affirms the Federal and Maine Constitutional right to keep and bear arms along with updating 
current Maine law to prohibit registries, records or databases for firearms and firearm related information. 
Mainers expect that their firearms rights be left alone. Remember that registration always leads to confiscation.  
 
Please support closing the gap in the law, by supporting this bill.  
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME 
Sanford City Councilor 
Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun Owners of Maine 
Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club 
National Rifle Association Member
