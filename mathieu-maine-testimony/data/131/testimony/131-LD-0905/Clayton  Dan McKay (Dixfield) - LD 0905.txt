LD 905
Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee.
The Rural Electronification Act brought electricity to rural America. Electricity has 
features in common with many commodities. Transporting it over long distances to 
sparsely settled locations is much more expensive than supplying and maintaining the 
infrastructure in urban locations.
The REA issued low interest loans to rural areas to pay for the infrastructure. Many 
rural residents organized into co-ops, pooling the money needed to pay off the loans.
LD 905 would recreate the conditions before the REA.
High density areas that would form municipal utilities would place investor-owned 
utilities in a bind. 
The revenue stream from high density areas compensates for the lesser revenue 
streams from low density areas. The loss of providing electricity to high-density areas
would cause the electricity delivery price of rural areas to rise dramatically by way of 
maintenance costs. 
This, in turn, would drastically reduce the value of the investor-owned utility, placing 
it in the crosshairs of a government takeover.
Too much legislation has shifted the balance of electricity costs onto the less wealthy 
people of Maine; this bill would sink rural Maine into severe energy poverty.
