On behalf of the 
Maine State Chamber of Commerce 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
in opposition to 
L.D. 513, An Act Regarding Overtime Protections for Certain Maine Workers 
April 25, 2023 
Sen. Tipping, Rep. Roeder and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, my name 
is Peter Gore, and I am a Government Affairs Consultant with Maine Street Solutions, and I am here on behalf of 
my client, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, a statewide business association representing both large and 
small businesses speaking to you today in opposition to L.D. 513, An Act Regarding Overtime Protections for 
Certain Maine Workers. 
L.D. 513 proposes to the increase the overtime threshold by adjusting the multiplier that is currently part of 
Maine's wage and hour law, by over $20,000 over a three-year period, finally landing somewhere above $65,000 by 
2026. It should be noted that this bill has been discussed and debated and rejected every year since its introduction 
in 2019 during the 129"‘ Legislature. 
Passage ofthis bill would be catastrophic for thousands of for-profit and non-profit businesses of all sizes, across 
the state of Maine. 
Referred to as the "overtime" threshold, or alternately as the "salaried" threshold, it is the monetary dividing 
line between employees who are considered salaried/exempt for the purposes of overtime pay, and those who are 
hourly workers and therefore eligible for overtime pay after working 40 hours in a week. 
Since 2009, Maine's monetary dividing line separating hourly/non-exempt versus salaried/exempt has been tied 
to changes in Maine's minimum wage. At that time, Title 26 was amended to create a threshold that is 3000 times 
the state's minimum wage. While the federal threshold, which was updated and became effective 1/1/2020 is 
currently set at $35,568 (and apparently soon to be adjusted upwards by the Biden Administration) Maine's 
threshold has climbed to its current level of $41,400 since this bill was last debated in 2022. It will continue to 
increase, as Maine's minimum wage is indexed by changes to the CPI here yearly. 
Under the most current version, LD 513 would adjust the multiplier in statute, increasing it each year; to 3500 
times in 2024, 4000 times in 2025, and 4500 times by 2026. It is difficult to access where our threshold would be by 
the time the full implementation of this law was complete. That is itself presents problems for employers trying to 
plan and budget going forward, but the larger problem will be the cost. As I indicated, Maine's minimum wage will 
be adjusted annually based on changes in the UCPI. Last year that resulted in a 9.1 % increase — translated in toa 
$1.05 increase, leaving our minimum wage at $13.80 cents an hour. The size of that adjustment, like many other 
things, was impacted by the effects of skyrocketing inflation. As we predicted the last time we testified against this 
bill, in future years the adjustment could result in increases of greater than just the 15-cent increase of the first year 
of adjustment. However, taking a conservative approach, let us suppose that the $1.05 cent increase is an anomaly, 
and future increases hover at half that, or .55 cents per year through 2026. That would leave Maine with minimum 
wage of $15.45 an hour, and a salary threshold of S-$69,525 ($15.4Sx4500) — undoubtably the highest overtime 
threshold in the nation. And unaffordable for many Maine small business. 
In 2015 and 2016, the ﬁnal two years of President Barack Obama’s tenure, he directed the U.S. Department of 
Labor to undertake rulemaking to adjust the threshold nationally. The process was a contentious one, with the U.S. 
Department of Labor receiving literally hundreds of thousands of comments on the subject from employers and

labor groups alike. After an initial recommendation of roughly $52,000, the department issued threshold guidelines 
increasing the amount from $23,660 to $47,467, to take effect in 2016. 
Not surprisingly, this represented a significant jump for many employers across the nation, and a particularly 
huge leap for many small businesses, who were paying salaried employees more than $23,660, but less than $47,467 
(or $912 per week). Employers balked, both at the amount and the small timeframe given to adjust salaries — or 
demote workers to hourly status. 
Again, not surprisingly litigation ensued, and in August 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Texas later invalidated this regulation on the basis that the $47,456 annual salary ($913 per week) was so high as to 
render the duties tests for exemption irrelevant. 
This is extremely important — because who is considered exempt from overtime eligibility versus those who 
qualify for overtime pay is a multi-pronged test — the aforementioned pay test and a duties test. in addition to the 
minimum salary level, employees must also perform certain duties to qualify for the Fair Labor Standards Act's white 
collar (executive, administrative and professional) exemption. The court found that the duties tests were the more 
appropriate representation of Congressional intent for exemption, and that the salary test was to serve merely asa 
proxy, or shorthand, for the duties test. The court ruled that the salary test was increased so much as to make the 
duties test irrelevant, and that the new salary test would render non-exempt those employees who should be 
exempt due to the duties they perform. 
With the huge salary threshold leaps LD 513 would require of Maine employers, the bill appears to make the 
same mistake. The ultimate level of possibly more than $69,000 is even higher than the final Obama threshold level 
of more than $47,000, and only slightly lower than the nation's highest salary threshold in California's for employers 
with more than 26 employees - $58,240 — thereby making Maine the highest threshold in the nation. 
Many workers currently considered salaried, or management employees would likely see their position 
converted to hourly. Employers would just not be able to keep pace with the salary adjustments necessary to 
maintain exempt status, creating considerable morale issues in the workplace. Previously salaried workers will feel 
demoted and that their career trajectory stunted due to the change. What is more, employers will be forced to retool 
their workforce, all the while trying to maintain productivity. in situations where business cannot meet the new 
salary requirements, employees who move from salaried to hourly will be asked to turn in cell phones, laptops, 
tablets, etc., and instructed to conduct no work after hours — even if their work ethic motivated them to continue to 
do so, and thereby negatively impacting productivity. 
in the non-proﬁt world, if LD 513 becomes law, the impact could be equally destructive — particularly for 
charitable non-profits. The bill attempts to exempt these groups by allowing for the use of "compensatory time." 
But the workability of this exemption is suspect at best. And it is likely that employees would, at some point in the 
future, rightfully want to be compensated for their work. These groups survive on contributions, and in some cases, 
contracts with local governments to provide services. So, they are not necessarily able to go out and raise more 
revenue to cover these increased labor costs, particularly the amount necessary to cover the increases envisioned 
by LD 513. People working for these groups generally do so because they believe in the mission of helping others; 
they understand that they will not be making as much as other employees. In many cases, jacking up the salary 
thresholds for exempt employees means they will no longer be able to work the longer and irregular hours providing 
these services demands. The same holds true for local and state governments, whose only method of raising 
revenues to cover LD 513's increases would be to raise property taxes on their citizenry. 
LD 513 will significantly increase to cost of doing business for nearly every employer - for profit or non-profit, 
large, or small —- operating in Maine. Furthermore, it will make Maine an outlier compared nearly every other state 
that have not imposed such standards on their businesses. This bill will certainly hurt Maine's ability to attract new 
businesses, new jobs, and new opportunities for our citizens, at precisely the worst time. It is for these reasons that 
we are strongly opposed to LD 513. Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with our comments.
