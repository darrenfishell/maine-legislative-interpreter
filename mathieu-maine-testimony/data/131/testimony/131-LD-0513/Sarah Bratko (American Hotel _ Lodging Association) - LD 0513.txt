Re: L.D. 513 - An Act Regarding Overtime Protections for Certain Maine Workers  
Dear Committee Members:  
 
On behalf of the American Hotel & Lodging Association, I write to express my concerns with L.D. 513, 
which would drastically increase the overtime salary threshold  in Maine.  
 
AHLA represents all segments of the U.S. lodging  industry including hotel owners, franchisees, REITs, 
chains, management companies, independent propert ies, bed and breakfasts, state hotel associations, and 
industry suppliers. In operation for over 100 years, AHLA represents well -known hotel brands as we ll as 
small business owners. Its membership includes owners of more than 33,000 small business properti es 
and more than 55,900 properties across the nation.  
The bill will impose significant new economic costs and limit workplace flexibility, impede career and 
promotion opportunities, and make it harder for businesses and nonprofits to expand to meet the needs of 
their customers and constituents. Many reclassif ied employees will lose benefits, flexibility, status and 
opportunities for advancement.  
The hospitality industry in Maine is still recovering from the COVID -pandemic. Labor mandates such as 
this bill make that recovery more challenging.  
 
If you  have any questions, please do not hesitate to contac t me at sbratko@ahla.com . 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Sarah R. Bratko, Esq.
