RE: Testimony  in OPPOSITION to LD 513, An Act Regarding Overtime Protections for Certain Maine 
Workers  
Dear Senator Tipping , Representative Roeder  and members of the Labor  and Housing  Committee:  
 
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO  of the Retail Association of Maine. I am a 
resident of Topsham.  We have more than 350  members statewide and  represent retailers of all sizes. 
Maine’s retailers employ more than 85 ,000 Mainers. We are here today to testify in strong  opposition to 
LD 513. 
 
Under current Maine law, the salary threshold for whether or not an employee is exempt from overtime 
or not is calculated at 3000x the prevailing minimum wage. With the minimum wage at $13.80  per hour, 
the salary threshold is currently $41,400, a 13.5% jum p from the last time this bill was heard in the 130th 
Legislative Session as LD 607. Next year, it will rise again  and increase every year after that. LD 513 
would set an unrealistic and unsustainable salary threshold  and we are disappointed to see this is sue 
proposed once again in Maine .  
 
Recently , LD 1376 was introduced which would increase Maine’s minimum wage to $15 per hour with a 
minimum of $1 per hour increases every year. If both LD 513, and LD 1376 were to pass, the salary 
threshold in Maine woul d be at least $76,500 in 2026 , and would  be at least $108,000 in 2033 .  
 
LD 513 puts employers in a very difficult spot. It is perfectly reasonable to have a salaried staffer  in 
Maine  making $40,000+ in salary. If LD 513 were to pass, the employer would essentially have to tell 
that staffer that  they are once again moving back to hourly status and will need to punch a time clock 
again  to track their t ime.  
 
We understand the Biden Administration is pursuing this issue at the federal level, and a proposal is 
expected sometime in May. Addressing thi s issue at the federal level is a more appropriate venue.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Curtis Picard, CAE , President and CEO
