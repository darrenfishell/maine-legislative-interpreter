Good
afternoon
Senat or
Tipping,
Repr esentativ e
Roeder ,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
513,
“ An
Act
Regar ding
Ov er time
Pr otections
for
Cer tain
Maine
W ork ers. ”
I
happen
t o
ha v e
a
personal
connection
t o
this
issue,
ha ving
been
a
victim
of
wage
theft
b y
a
Maine
emplo y er
who
abused
their
ability
t o
classify
cer tain
emplo y ees
as
ex empt
fr om
the
FLSA.
A
little
o v er
a
decade
ago,
in
my
ﬁrst
job
out
of
college,
I
work ed
for
a
publicly-tr aded
softwar e
company
located
in
a
suburb
of
P or tland.
Most
of
my
cowork ers
wer e
also
r ecent
college
gr ads
who
wer e
y oung,
naïv e
and
eager
t o
please.
W e
wer e
often
ask ed
t o
come
in
early
or
t o
sta y
late,
working
many
extr a
hours
for
which
we
wer e
not
compensated,
due
t o
us
r eceiving
a
salar y
and
being
classiﬁed
as
ex empt.
I
e v entually
mo v ed
on
fr om
that
company ,
but
shor tly
after war d
I
r eceiv ed
notice
of
a
class-action
lawsuit
against
them.
I
had
not
been
awar e
that,
due
t o
the
natur e
of
the
duties
that
I
and
my
cowork ers
had
per formed,
we
could
not
legally
be
classiﬁed
as
ex empt.
That
case
ended
up
being
settled
conﬁdentially
out
of
cour t.
The
most
frustr ating
par t
of
this
st or y
is
that
this
company
continues
the
same
beha vior .
Looking
online,
I
can
see
that
the y
ha v e
settled
at
least
four
mor e
similar
lawsuits
since
that
time,
with
some
as
r ecent
as
last
y ear .
It
is
appar ently
less
expensiv e
for
them
t o
pa y
lawy ers
t o
settle
these
cases
than
it
is
t o
simply
pa y
their
emplo y ees
the
wages
the y
ha v e
rightfully
earned.
Raising
the
minimum
salar y
that
an
emplo y ee
must
earn
t o
be
consider ed
ex empt
will
help
t o
pr e v ent
this
type
of
wage
theft
b y
limiting
a
company ’ s
ability
t o
misclassify
lower-paid
salaried
work ers
in
the
ﬁrst
place.
Please
v ote
Ought
T o
P ass
on
LD
513.
Maine
work ers
deser v e
it.
Thank
y ou
for
y our
time
t oda y .
