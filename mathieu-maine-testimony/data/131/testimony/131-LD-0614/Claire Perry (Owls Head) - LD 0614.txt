Honorable Committee Members: 
OPPOSED
When our IF&W Dept. is asked to give something free to  landowner-hunters, which 
automatically excludes non-landowner-hunters, red flags should go up all over the 
place. 
And what of landowners in general, who refrain from posting their property but do 
not, themselves, hunt ?
And what of those that post their land for any number of very valid reasons that have 
nothing to do with hunting, but everything to do with legal access for complete 
strangers; especially concerning where children and animals are involved. 
I see this as undesirable right from the get-go. But even more-so, with a guarantee of 
a permit that others have obtain by the lottery itself...let alone get it for FREE !
Not good. 
Sincerely,
