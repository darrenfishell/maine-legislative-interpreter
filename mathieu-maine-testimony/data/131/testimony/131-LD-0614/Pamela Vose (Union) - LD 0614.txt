LD 614
I am writing in opposition to LD 614 - An Act to Provide a Free Antlerless Deer 
Permit to Certain Landowners Who Allow the Public to Hunt on Their Property
I am opposed to this bill because it grants a free permit to all landowners who do not 
post their property if it is over a certain acreage if they apply for the lottery.   This is 
discriminatory and favors only a certain few hunters.   These people are guaranteed a 
permit at no cost while others have to pay a fee and depend on the luck of the lottery.  
In the past, a small percentage of the lottery was guaranteed to these hunters but they 
still had to pay.  That favoritism was bad enough, but this is way worse.
