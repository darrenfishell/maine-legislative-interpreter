Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1456:
“An
Act
to
Facilitate
the
Expansion
of
Broadband”
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities
and
Technology,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1456.
This
bill
is
proposed
to
support
so-called
“community
broadband”
projects.
For
the
uninitiated,
this
means
internet
providers
owned
and
funded
solely
by
the
government.
Only
sometimes
(not
often)
are
these
government-owned
networks
(GONs)
building
new
service
connections
to
those
who
currently
do
not
have
adequate
access
to
the
internet.
They
are
more
likely
to
overbuild
wasteful
and
duplicative
systems
which
are
wasteful
at
best,
and
distort
the
market
for
everyone
else
at
worst.
Of
course,
the
Mills
administration
and
Maine
Connectivity
Authority
(MCA)
have
been
constantly
moving
the
goalposts
for
which
households
are
considered
“served”
or
“unserved”
in
order
to
use
the
massive
infusion
of
funds
from
the
federal
government
in
the
way
they
see
fit.
1
Unfortunately
for
consumers,
these
players
almost
always
incentivize
and
push
for
local
governments
to
use
funds
to
build,
maintain,
and
operate
their
own
internet
service
provider
(ISP).
Even
where
residents
are
served
by
numerous
companies
offering
internet
connections
with
speeds
determined
by
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
(FCC)
as
adequate,
MCA
often
steamrolls
past
these
legacy
providers
to
promote
historically
the
most
wasteful
and
ineffective
schemes
for
delivering
internet
service
to
those
who
want
it:
government-owned
networks.
Nearly
wherever
they
are
tried
around
the
nation,
GONs
let
down
local
taxpayers
and
the
internet
consumers
they
purport
to
help.
Duplication
of
services
often
leads
to
costly
inefficiencies
and
less
private-sector
investment.
Plus,
municipalities
rarely
account
for
future
maintenance
costs
as
a
result
of
establishing
a
GON.
Considering
many
publicly-owned
local
networks
require
substantial
bonding
to
get
off
the
ground,
the
economics
of
GONs
do
not
allow
for
local
taxpayer
confidence
that
their
investment
will
be
recouped
in
any
reasonable
timeframe.

Using
data
over
a
five-year
period,
a
2017
University
of
Pennsylvania
Law
School
study
of
20
GONs
around
the
United
States
found
that
only
two
were
on
track
to
recover
their
total
costs
over
the
course
of
their
useful
life
expectancy,
between
30
and
40
years.
Eleven
did
not
bring
in
enough
money
to
cover
current
operating
costs,
and
five
of
the
nine
cash-flow
positive
projects
were
projected
to
take
over
100
years
to
recover
their
costs.2
Broadband
markets
are
no
different
in
Maine.
Customers
will
not
be
able
to
afford
the
higher
costs,
both
for
their
service,
and
from
their
municipality’s
misguided
bonding
for
a
wasteful
and
duplicative
GON.
Please
deem
LD
1456
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
instead
get
the
government
out
of
the
way
of
worthwhile
private
investment
in
broadband
service,
like
what
Charter/Spectrum
announced
just
this
month.

Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
