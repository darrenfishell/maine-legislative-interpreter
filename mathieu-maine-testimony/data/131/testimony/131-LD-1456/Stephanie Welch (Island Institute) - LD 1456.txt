Senator Lawrence , Representative Zeigle r, and members of the Committee on Energy, Utilities 
and Technology , my name is Stephanie Welch , and I offer this testimony on behalf of the Island 
Institute in general support of LD 1456, An Act to Facilitate the Expansion of Broadband.    
  
The Island Institute is a 40 -year -old nonprofit organization based in R ockland, Maine. We work 
to sustain Maine’s island and coastal communities. The Island Institute’s community development work focuses on the marine economy, climate and energy pilots, small businesses, education, and leadership. Broadband is foundational to  all of this work, and all 
Mainers need to have the ability to access and use high- speed, reliable internet .  
 
  
The Island Institute has been working since 2015 to support coastal and island communities, 
along with  several inland communities, in their efforts to access broadband . As a Maine 
Connectivity Authority Regional and Tribal Broadband Partner, we work  to support community -
driven broadband solutions to ensure digital equity and inclusion and coordination between 
communities, regions and the state. Navigating p ole attachment timelines and costs is  often 
identified a hurdle to broadband expansion in Maine . We generally support efforts to address 
these hurdles, and efforts to facilitate broadband expansion.
