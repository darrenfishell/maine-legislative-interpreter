In Support Of 
L.D. 1602 – An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Stakeholder Group Convened by 
the Emergency Medical Services' Board on Financial Health of Ambulance Services 
May 2, 2023 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Heath Care, Insurance and Financial 
Services Committee, my name is Jeffrey Austin and I am here on behalf of the Maine Hospital 
Association to testify in support of LD 1602. 
We support most of this bill but have one suggested edit. 
The issue of the availability of ambulance services is of very high concern to our members.  Our 
members need ambulances to transport patients from one hospital to another.  Sometimes, that 
transport is acutely needed – a patient with a severe medical condition in one hospital that needs 
to go to a larger, tertiary care facility. 
These transports are less and less available as ambulance services struggle to do their E-911 
obligations. 
We support sections 1, 3 and 4 of the bill without reservation. 
Most of section 2 is fine with us as well.  However, we would suggest an edit. 
On page 2, line 31, there is an exemption section and we would like you to add hospital-based 
services to the exemption provision. 
The thrust of that section is an attempt to get ambulances to join carrier networks by setting 
reimbursement standards for ambulances.  Our ambulances are always in network, are a part of a 
much larger contract and this level of rate intervention for hospital services is not necessary. 
Please exclude hospital-based practices from this provision by adding us to the exemption in line 
31. 
Thank you.
