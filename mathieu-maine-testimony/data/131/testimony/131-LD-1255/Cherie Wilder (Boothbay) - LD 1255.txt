Subject: LD1255 testimony 
from 
I'm trying to submit testimony on LD1255 to the Vetrans and Legal Affairs committee. It won't allow me to attach and 
send it. Can you please forward my testimony to the committee members. Thank you. 
Good evening committee members. My name is Cherie Wilder. I am the coordinator for the Mid-Coast chapter of Gun 
Owners of Maine, the Secretary and a Board member of the Wiscasset Rod and Gun Club. I an also a law abiding citizen, 
asking you to oppose LD1255. 
LD1255 is a feel good, do-nothing bill that hopes to solve a problem that Maine doesn't have. LD1255 is vague but 
effectively would disarm law abiding citizens in an attempt to make voting locations Gun Free Zones. 
Maine already has a law making it illegal to display weapons in a threatening manner. And, gun owners follow that law. 
Maine gun owners are not shooting Maine voters at the polls. Maine gun owners are the safest in the country and 
Maine citizens are the safest in this country. Maine has a high rate of firearm ownership and we continue Tobe the 
safest, with the lowest crime rates and the fewest firearm incidents. In 2022 there were 44 homicides in Maine. Nota 
single death was at a polling location. Since the Yellow Flag law was implemented in 2020, there have been less than 40 
people to be "Yellow F|agged" . Not a single one involved polls or voting. Maine does not have a problem that LD1255 
would solve. LD1255 would not deter criminals. LD1255 would not lower crime. LD1255 would only serve to create soft 
targets in a state where police response times average 23 minutes. 
I question how it's voter suppression and intimidation to have armed security and metal detectors at voting locations 
but not suppression and intimidation to have armed security and metal detectors at the State House? Wouldn't these 
security measures deter citizens from participating in local government? 
l ask that you oppose LD1255. 
Cherie Wilder, Boothbay
