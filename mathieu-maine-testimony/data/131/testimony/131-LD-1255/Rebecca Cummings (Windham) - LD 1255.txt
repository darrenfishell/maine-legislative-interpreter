LD 1255
I DO NOT SUPPORT LD 1255 AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU! 
As a lifetime NRA member, United States Army veteran, and a woman who has 
relied on our slow-moving court system for additional security measures I DO NOT 
support any legislation which delays or inhibits the constitutional rights of 
law-abiding citizens; especially one that relates to personal protection. 
Our God-given constitutional rights DO NOT END within 250 ft of a polling station. 
STOP CREATING MORE SOFT TARGETS!!! Criminals certainly have no 
intentions of complying with any law(s). It's kinda their M.O. 
This committee's time would be better spent on strengthening the laws already on the 
books. Investigating and holding those within our law enforcement and judicial 
systems that aren't charging and prosecuting crimes accountable. 
DO NOT SUPPORT LD1255.
