My
name
is
Ruby
Fyf fe,
I
am
19
years
old,
and
I
worked
at
polling
locations
for
the
past
three
years
ranging
from
presidential
elections
to
local
town
elections.
I
can
share
from
first
hand
experience
that
election
days
are
days
of
great
excitement,
and
election
volunteers
like
myself
meet
many
incredible
people
while
doing
their
civic
duty .
As
someone
who
recently
graduated
from
an
American
public
high
school,
I
also
know
the
fear
of
mass
shootings
in
this
country .
I’ve
completed
countless
active
shooter
drills
and
school
lockdown
drills.
After
each
of
the
seemingly
never
ending
school
shootings
in
this
country ,
many
of
my
friends
and
I
walked
into
school
afraid.
I
would
hate
for
that
same
fear
to
follow
Americans
to
election
polls.
Allowing
guns
near
polling
places
would
bring
that
fear .
And,
as
a
volunteer ,
I
know
I
would
feel
threatened
for
helping
people
practice
their
right
to
vote
if
that
were
the
case.
People
should
feel
safe
when
going
to
the
polls
to
vote.
If
I
saw
a
person,
who
is
not
law
enforcement,
carrying
a
weapon
in
front
of
my
local
election
building,
I
do
not
know
if
I
would
want
to
vote
there
–
if
I
would
even
feel
safe
walking
in
that
area.
I
know
many
of
the
people
I
have
helped
practice
their
right
to
vote
over
the
years
would
feel
the
same.
The
election
polls
should
and
must
be
a
place
where
everyone
feels
comfortable
to
practice
their
civic
duty
of
voting.
Passing
this
legislation
would
help
ensure
that
that
remains
the
case
for
the
voters
of
Maine.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
