My
name
is
Beth
Ahearn,
Senior
Director
of
Government
Af fairs
at
Maine
Conservation
V oters,
writing
in
support
of
LD
1255,
“An
Act
to
Improve
the
Security
of
V oting
Places”
on
behalf
of
more
than
13,000
members
and
supporters
of
Maine
Conservation
V oters.
Maine
Conservation
V oters
works
to
build
an
inclusive
democracy
and
to
make
conservation
and
climate
action
a
political
priority .
W e
support
measures
that
make
voting
more
ef ficient,
secure,
and
accessible
for
all
eligible
Maine
voters
and
oppose
those
that
do
not
achieve
that
profoundly
American
goal.
While
obvious,
we
feel
obliged
to
note
that
it
is
imperative
that
voters
be
able
to
cast
their
ballots
and
election
workers
be
able
to
administer
elections
without
fear
of
violence.
Given
the
concerning
rise
in
election-related
violent
rhetoric,
we
believe
this
legislation
is
a
common
sense
step
that
will
allow
Maine
voters
and
election
workers
to
feel
more
comfortable
casting
their
ballot
in
person.
This
legislation
is
a
reasonable,
well-crafted
response
to
the
reality
of
American
life
today .
