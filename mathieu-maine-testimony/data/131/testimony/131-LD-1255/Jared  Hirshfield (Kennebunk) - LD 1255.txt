 
 Testimony in Opposition to LD 1255 
"An Act to Improve the Security of Voting Places" 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and distinguished members of the Committee 
on Veterans and Legal Affairs, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding LD 
1255.  
 
 Under Maine Criminal Code a dangerous weapon is 
(1) A firearm;   
(2) Any device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or serious 
bodily injury; or   
(3) Any other device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or 
inanimate, which, in the manner it is intended to be used by the actor, is capable of 
producing or threatening death or serious bodily injury. For purposes of this 
definition, the intent may be conditional.  
 
LD 1255 would essentially make all town halls in the State of Maine temporary 
‘dangerous weapon’  free zones while they are processing absentee ballots and conducting in 
person absentee voting. This creation of a temporary ‘dangerous weapons’  zone will be 
incredibly hard to enforce. How will the public be notified exactly when town halls become 
‘weapon’ free zones? Will a contractor going to get a building permit receive a $1000 fine for 
forgetting he is carrying his utility knife? The general public is not typically aware of exactly 
when municipalities begin processing absentee ballots and where that processing occurs.  
 
The topic of allowing town halls to ban the carrying of weapons has been discussed in 
Maine before. If it is the intent of the sponsor of this bill to allow that to occur, I would suggest a 
broader bill be introduced. This bill will create confusion and will be incredibly difficult to 
enforce.
