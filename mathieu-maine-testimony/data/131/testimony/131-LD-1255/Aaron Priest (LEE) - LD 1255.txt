Maine Constitution, Article 1, Section 16. To keep and bear arms.  Every citizen has a
right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be questioned.
Maine Constitution, Article IV, Section 1. The Legislature, with the exceptions 
hereinafter stated, shall have full power to make and establish all reasonable laws and 
regulations for the defense and benefit of the people of this State, not repugnant to 
this Constitution, nor to that of the United States.
I will not sacrifice one right to exercise another. The legislature has no power or 
authority to pass an UNREASONABLE law that REMOVES the defense of the 
people of this state, that is also clearly REPUGNANT to both state and federal 
constitutions and a violation of their oath of office to support the state and federal 
constitutions.
