 
 
Good morning Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. My name is Adam Zuckerman and I am the 
lobbyist for the Maine People’s Alliance. Our 32,000 stretch from Kittery to Fort Kent. 
 
I am here today to testify in favor of Representative Arford’s LD 1255, An Act to Improve the 
Security of Voting Places. 
 
Everyone in this room had to pass through a security check to enter the State House. That’s 
because we know that dangerous weapons have no place where Maine’s laws are made. 
Imagine if when you looked up in committee rooms or in the House or Senate galleries you saw 
fellow lawmakers and constituents displaying knives and guns. Prohibiting dangerous weapons 
from where you vote allows legislators to focus on crafting policy rather than worrying about 
their safety. Maine voters and election workers should have that same right.  
 
Reuters conducted a nationwide investigation that “identified 850 messages that met the level of 
threat that is a violation of federal law.” Here in Maine, the Secretary of State’s office received 
documented reports of at least two threats of physical violence against municipal clerks.1 That’s 
not right.  
 
Voting is our most sacred right and is the most fundamental to our democracy. The right to vote 
without fear is one of the main pillars that separates us from autocracies. Dangerous weapons 
and polling places in free, peaceful, and fair elections do not mix. That’s why I urge you to vote 
yes for LD 1255. Thank you.
