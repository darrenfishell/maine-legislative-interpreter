RE: LD 1255 - An Act to Improve the Security of Voting Places
Dear Honorable Members of the Maine Legislature:
As a concerned citizen and former state senate candidate for Auburn, Poland, Minot, 
Mechanic Falls, and New Gloucester, I am writing to express my strong support for 
gun restrictions at voting locations. My personal experience has demonstrated the 
urgent need for increased security measures to protect voters and ensure a fair and 
safe democratic process. 
During my campaign against Eric Brakey, I was regularly threatened by individuals 
who openly carried firearms. This not only made me feel personally targeted and 
unsafe but also had a chilling effect on my ability to freely and fairly campaign.
My experiences are not unique. Across the country, we have seen incidents of 
violence and intimidation at polling places, including armed individuals loitering 
outside of voting locations and shouting at voters. The presence of firearms at voting 
locations not only creates a threatening atmosphere but also has the potential to 
suppress voter turnout, particularly among marginalized communities who may feel 
particularly vulnerable or targeted. It also limits the number of qualified candidates 
who are willing to participate in the democratic process.  Participating in our political 
process is foundational tenant of our republic, and it should be an accessible and 
inclusive process for all individuals, regardless of their background or political 
beliefs.  
I urge you to support these measures and take a stand against violence and 
intimidation at polling places. By working together to create a secure and welcoming 
environment for all voters, we can uphold the values of democracy and protect the 
rights of every citizen.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Kimberly Sampson
