Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee. my name is Alysia Melnick, I'm here today to testify on behalf of Mainers for 
Modern Elections in support of LD 1255. An Act to improve the Security of Voting Places. 
Mainers for Modern Elections is a coalition committed to ensuring that our right to vote safely 
transcends politics and partisanship and that every eligible Mainer has the opportunity to cast 
a ballot in the manner that they choose. without fear of violence or intimidation. 
Coalition members include the ACLU of Maine. AARP of Maine. the Center for Secure and 
Modern Elections, Common Cause, Defend Our Health, Gateway Community Services, the 
League of \X/omen Voters of Maine, the Maine AFL-CIO, Maine Citizens for Clean Elections. 
Maine Conservation Voters. Maine Education Association, Maine EqualJustice. Maine 
Immigrant Rights Coalition, Maine People's Alliance. Maine Service Employees 
Association-SEIU Local 1989, Maine \X/omen's Lobby. Maine Youth Power, Planned Parenthood 
of Northern New England, and Represent Us. 
\X/ith a rise in tensions centered on elections and the fear of political violence in this country. 
we are concerned that the presence of dangerous weapons at polling places could be used to 
intimidate some voters and prevent them from freely participating in our democracy. This is 
especially true for immigrant and BIPOC voters, who are the most likely to be victims of both 
political violence and voter suppression tactics. 
Maine state law wisely identiﬁes certain places where the risks of carrying a dangerous 
weapon are so great that theyjustify limitations. Dangerous weapons are prohibited from 
schools. courthouses, and this very building. This body has recognized that the presence of an 
armed member of the public in the halls of the legislature could threaten the safe and 
representative exercise of democracy. \X/eapons in polling places. where citizens play a critical 
role in our democracy, are no less a threat. 
Please vote Ought To Pass on LD 1255 in order to keep voters, poll workers. and election 
administrators safe.
