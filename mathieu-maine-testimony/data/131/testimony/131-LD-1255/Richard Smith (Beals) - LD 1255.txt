LD 1255
Esteemed committee members,
LD 1255- An Act To Improve The Security Of Voting Places, is another repeat 
attempt at yet another piece of garbage legislation that the good people of Maine have
shouted down previously. LD 1255 is a garbage piece of legislation, for the same 
reason that previous attempts at "gun-free polling place" legislation were garbage. 
While being touted as an improvement in security/safety for voters, this legislation 
would, in reality, increase the danger for many of Maine's voters. This legislation 
would force citizens to disarm to go to their polling place. This is unacceptable! Even 
in our beautiful, wonderful state, there are neighborhoods & districts where many do 
not feel safe to walk the streets without a way of defending themselves.
Legislation such as LD 1255 could discourage voter participation in many of these 
seedier parts of our urban areas, and therefore I must urge you to declare LD 1255 
OUGHT NOT PASS!!
