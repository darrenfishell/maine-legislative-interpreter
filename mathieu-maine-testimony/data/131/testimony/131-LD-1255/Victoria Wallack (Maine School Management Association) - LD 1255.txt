TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 1255  
 
AN ACT TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY OF VOTING PLACES  
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Sup ica, and members of the Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs, I am 
Victoria Wallack, director of communications and government affairs for Maine School Management  
Association , testifying on behalf of the legislative committees of  the Maine School Superintendents 
Association and the Maine School Boards Association in support of L.D. 1255.  
 
Maine law , 20-A, Section 6552, already prohibit s guns on school property â€“ a law passed in 2009 that we 
strongly supported as an association.  By prohibiting guns on school property, it  essentially prohibited guns at 
voting places  when the v ote was held at a school.  
 
We still  are concern ed that people who have concealed carry permits could forget they had the gun when 
going into a voting booth set up  at a school . And many communities still use schools as voting places.  
 
This bill prohibits a person from carrying or discharging a dangerous weapon while in a voting place or within 
250 feet of a voting place. If passed, it would further support our effor ts to make sure no guns, ex cept those 
carried by law enforcement, make it onto school grounds.
