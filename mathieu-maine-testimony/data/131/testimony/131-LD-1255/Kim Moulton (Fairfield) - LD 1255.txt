LD 1255
Dear Honorable Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Members of the 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs,
I write to you today to express my opposition to LD 1255 - An Act to Improve the 
Security of Voting Places.
Succinctly, no place is made more secure by disarming law-abiding citizens. To a 
mass murdering criminal, so-called Gun Free Zones are defenseless target-rich 
environments. 
Instituting this historically racist subjugation ensured in Maine law â€“ the state would 
deny a lawful citizen a civil right in order to exercise another civil right? This is 
particularly heinous, offensive, and appalling.  It appears by design intent to enable 
some people to intimidate and suppress certain other voters.
I urge you to vote "Ought Not to Pass".
Respectfully,
Kim Moulton
Fairfield, ME
