LD 1255
I oppose LD 1255, “An Act to Improve the Security of Voting Places”.
The last thing that Mainers need is a New York style ban on carrying self-defense 
guns while voting.  
Maine has always been one of the safest states in the nation. It is not the “wild west” 
as many indicated it would be if Constitutional Carry were enacted. It was enacted, 
and we are still the safest state in the nation. This is a solution looking for a problem 
that does not exist. It is yet another partisan attack on our Maine and United States 
Constitutional right to bear arms (shall never be questioned/infringed).
 
Mainers have a long track record of carrying and using firearms in a responsible and 
safe manner. So law-abiding Maine residents should not be forced to choose which 
civil right they will exercise -- the right to vote or the right to be armed.  Because both
of these rights are guaranteed by the Maine and US Constitutions, LD 1255 is as 
repugnant as a poll tax. It is the epitome of voter suppression.
Again, I oppose LD 1255, “An Act to Improve the Security of Voting Places”. The 
bill cannot be fixed -- so a vote of "ought not to pass" is the only acceptable vote.
