opposition of LD1255  LINDA P HASKELL GARLAND, MAINE
Why would I want the Voting Places to be a gun free area? No, so that we can have a 
criminal or uneducated gun holder come to the voting place and start shooting people.
There are those of us with concealed carry licenses that are trained in the proper use 
of firearms. If the government had left well enough alone and left the family care and 
punishment and training to the parents, we would not have the terrible upward killing 
of people. What about the knives, box cutters, ice picks, pens, and any other sharp or 
explosive item. The public has got to get a hand on this and not let the Democrats and 
the Communist party destroy our elections. LINDA P HASKELL GARLAND,
