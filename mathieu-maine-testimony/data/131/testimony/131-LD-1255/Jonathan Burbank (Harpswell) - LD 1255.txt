LD 1255
I am writing to oppose LD1255. Good public policies are based on facts and data and 
historical evidence, and effective laws are written when lawmakers actually 
understand those factors. There is not a shred of evidence that individuals carrying 
items prohibited under this bill has or have affected polling places and peoples 
willingness to vote in person. Every  person I know who works on a farm or the 
waterfront as a fisherman carries a pocket knife which would be a dangerous weapon 
under this proposed bill.  And I am sure over the years hundreds of thousands of 
people have voted with out the paranoid delusion people supporting this bill even 
knowing they had a "dangerous weapon". Further there is not a shred of evidence to 
support this bill having a general public safety benefit. And moreover the current 
drafting borders on willful ignorance to trap people into breaking the law. How might 
a law abiding person know that absentee voting is happening. Will Towns now be 
required to put up applicable signage at the appropriate distance as you drive to the 
Town office to pay your tax bill saying voting in progress so that you can quickly 
park on the side of the road and toss your "dangerous weapon" (pocket knife) in your 
trunk.  If you support this then its time to require metal detectors and armed LEO 
presence at the polls everywhere and all the time.
