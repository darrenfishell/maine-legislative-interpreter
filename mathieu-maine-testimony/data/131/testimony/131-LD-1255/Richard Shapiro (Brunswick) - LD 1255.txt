Please oppose this bill.
There is no reason why banning the law abiding from carrying weapons to defend 
themselves at polling places could have any positive effect on the risk of violence at 
polling places.  The irrational fear of legally armed law abiding citizens is something 
that should be discouraged.
As usual for such bills, there the bill does nothing whatsoever to prevent a person who
intends harm from carrying a weapon.  
Besides - any such violence is already illegal.  People proposing legislation such as 
this seem to forget that.  
A person intent on breaking the law does not care if he or she breaks one additional 
law.  These days, most such people know that they are not going to survive the 
encounter, and seek only an "unarmed victim zone" to do as much damage as possible
before they die.
This, this bill would quite literally increase the danger of violence at polling places.
Please oppose this pointless infringement on our Second Amendment right to self 
defense.  It would be far better to encourage Maine citizens to arm themselves - it 
would save lives.
