Testimony in support of LD 1255 An Act to Improve the Security of Voting Places. 
Thank you Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and esteemed Members of the Committee. 
l stand in Support of LD 1255. 
My name is Kathleen McFadden and l live in Gouldsboro, a rural community in DownEast 
Maine. I am a voter and volunteer nonpartisan election observer in both Hancock and 
Washington county. 
Armed extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Nationalist Social Club-131 are becoming 
emboldened and making their presence known in Maine. Just last week there was an 
altercation in Portland between law enforcement members of NSC - 131. In my community, 
recruitment ﬂyers for these militia organizations are not uncommon and are popping up with an 
alarming frequency on community bulletin boards. 
The intent of these groups is to disrupt and intimidate citizens in public places. Protecting 
Voting Rights is essential to a strong and functioning democracy. Weapons of any sort (except 
those carried by trained law enforcement) and armed intimidation are a threat to free and fair 
elections and a citizens ’ ability to safely exercise their right to vote. l urge the committee to vote 
to pass LD 1255. 
Thank you Representative Alford for bringing this important bill forward.
