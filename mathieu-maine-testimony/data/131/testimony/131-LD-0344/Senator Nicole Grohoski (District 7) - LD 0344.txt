Testimony of Senator Nicole Grohoski 
In Support of LD 344, A
n Act to Establish Maine Alewife
Day
Before the Committee on State and Local Government 
14 February 2023
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover , and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on State
and Local Government, my name is Nicole Grohoski and I represent Senate District 7, which is
most of Hancock County . I am speaking today in support of LD 344, "An Act to Establish Maine
Alewife Day .‚Äù
This bill would designate the Saturday before Memorial Day of each year as "Maine Alewife
Day." This bill not only recognizes the significance of the alewife fish in Maine's history , culture,
and ecosystems, but also serves as an opportunity to celebrate and promote the state's
recreational and commercial fishing heritage. Many of my constituents have been involved in
restoring alewife migration routes and volunteering in annual alewife counts, and this bill would
recognize their ef forts.
The alewife, a species of river herring, provides important food for many native species and
serves as a key indicator of the health of our marine ecosystems. The alewives are a critical
source of bait for Maine's commercial lobstering industry and provide a source of food (and
sometimes festivals!) for many families in the state.
I strongly ur ge you to support this bill and help preserve the legacy of alewives in Maine. This is
not just about recognizing a species, but also about recognizing the importance of this fishing
tradition for our state's economy , history , and culture.
Thank you for listening to my testimony in support of LD 344. I would be happy to answer
questions.
