Greetings Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on State and Local Government. 
I would like to voice my support for LD 344 An Act to Establish Maine Alewife Day. 
For thousands of years, alewives have completed their ocean migration and returned to Maine’s 
rivers each spring to spawn. The ecological importance of these ﬁsh cannot be overstated. 
Arriving in huge schools, alewives provide a critical food source for just about every living 
creature from the coastal estuaries to our inland lakes and ponds. The Passamaquoddy name for 
alewives translates to the ﬁsh that feed all. 
The spring alewife harvest has long been a huge part of Maine’s ﬁshing heritage. Once harvested 
as a primary source of food for human consumption, most alewives are used as lobster bait 
today. In many cases, it has been the stewardship of alewife harvesters that have maintained a 
sustainable resource. As state and federal regulators have closed commercial harvest sites, the 
ﬁnancial incentive to maintain this resource has been lost and the number of alewives has 
declined. 
In recent years, there has been an effort to restore ﬁsh passage in Maine rivers by removing dams 
or creating effective ﬁshways. Alewives are now returning to lakes and ponds for the ﬁrst time in 
over one hundred years. These projects have received valuable media coverage which has 
increased the awareness of the importance of alewives. 
Creating an Alewife Day will help to sustain the momentum that restoration projects have 
fostered within Maine commtmities and will motivate the environmental organizations and local 
stakeholders to continue to connect people with these valuable little ﬁsh. 
Thank you for taking the time to consider these thoughts. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Bailey Bowden
