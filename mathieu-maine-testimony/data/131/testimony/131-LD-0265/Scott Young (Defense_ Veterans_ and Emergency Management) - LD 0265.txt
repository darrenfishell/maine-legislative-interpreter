Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs  
 
February 13 , 2023  
 
Senator Hickman , Representative Supica , and honorable members of the Veterans and Legal 
Affairs  Committee , I am  Scott Young, D eputy Commissioner, Department of Defense, Veterans 
and Emergency Management  (DVEM) . I writing to provide a letter regarding LD 265, An Act to 
Provide Suppor t Services for Military Members Transitioning to Civilian Life in Maine . 
 
As you are aware similar bills have been proposed in previous legislatures which ultimately resulted in language and funding being provided in Public Law 2021, Chapter 483 An Act To Provide Allocations for the Distribution of State Fiscal Recovery Funds  which establish ed a pilot 
project to conduct outreach and to provide support services for active -duty military members  
transitioning to civilian life in the State. The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development  (DECD), in consultation with DVEM, was designated to establish this pilot and 
funding was provided to DECD for this purpose. It is our understanding DECD is willing to continue the program.   I also understand DECD has  been in contact with the sponsor, Representative Terry, to amend 
the bill to identify DECD as the agency to carry on and receive funding for this program. We concur with this proposal.   If our department can be of further assistance, please reach out to me at 
Scott.a.young@maine.gov.
