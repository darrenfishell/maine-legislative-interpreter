Testimony on 
L.D. 1154, “An Act Regarding Accessory Dwelling Units and 
Municipal Zoning Ordinances" 
Presented by 
Representative David Woodsome 
District 139 
Joint Select Committee on Housing 
Tuesday, April ll, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and 
distinguished members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing: 
I am State Representative David Woodsome, and I proudly 
represent District 139, Limerick, Parsonsfield, and a portion of 
Waterboro. It is an honor to appear before you today for the 
purpose of introducing L.D. 1154, “An Act Regarding Accessory 
Dwelling Units and Municipal Zoning Ordinances. ” 
In the spirit of supporting local control, this bill proposes 
to “allow” as opposed to “require” municipal zoning ordinances 
to provide for accessory dwelling units under certain 
conditions. Maine's affordable housing crisis is one we all 
seek to resolve by easing regulations and increasing incentives. 
Nonetheless, our communities should be allowed the opportunity 
to choose how best to manage their population density. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. Testimony to 
follow will expand upon my rationale for submitting L.D. 1154.
