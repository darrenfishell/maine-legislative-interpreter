Senator Pierce , Representative Gere , and Honorable Members of the Committee  on Housing :  
 
My name is Amy Winston and I live in Edgecomb. I am testifying today in opposition  of LD 214, LD 665, 
and LD 1154  on behalf of Coastal Enterprises, Inc. (CEI),  a community development financial institution 
(CDFI) founded in 1977. CEI works to build a just, vibran t, and climate resilient future for people in 
communities  in Maine and other rural regions by integrating financing, business and industry expertise, 
and policy solutions. We envision a world in which communities are economically and environmentally 
healthy, enabling all people, especially those with low incomes , to reach their full potential. CEI is a 
member of the Maine Alliance for Smart Growth and the Maine Affordable Housing Coalition . CEI’s 
Financial Development Services team provides direct counseling services, focusing on foreclosure 
prevention counseling for distressed borrowers and consumers throughout the state. CEI has had a long 
history of engagement in the affordable housing space. While we no longer manage affordable housing 
properties, we continue to fin ance projects that create new housing units , catalyze economic activity, 
create jobs,  and revitalize downtowns . Affordable workforce housing is a key economic challenge  for the  
businesses we finance, affecting their  ability to recruit and retain workers .  
 
In March of 2022, I submitted testimony supporting LD 2003 during the 130th legislative session. The 
purpose and intent of this bill was to remove land use and zoning barriers to promote effective planning, 
adequate inventory, and equitable access to hous ing. An amended version of this bill was later passed and 
approved by the Governor  in April of 2022. It is now enacted  in Maine law as  under 30-A M .R.S.A. 
§4364 -A, §4364 -B, §4364 -C. The bill also amended provisions of 5 M .R.S.A. §13056 .  
 
LD 214, LD 665, and LD 1154 all seek to make amendments to  the laws enacted under LD 2003 , each of 
which would significantly hamper the purpose  of those laws . LD 214 would limit the scope of 30-A 
M.R.S.A. §4364 -A, by amending the law so that it only applies to munici palities with populations of 
10,000 or greater. Of Maine’s nearly 500 municipalities, only 22 have populations above the 10,000- person 
proposed threshold . As the law is meant to expand access to affordable housing in Maine, LD 214 would 
make it so that most of the  towns in the state would not be required to allow for the construction of four 
dwelling unit s per lot in growth areas of Maine municipalities , thereby negatively  impa cting the 
expansion of affordable housing within the state , particularly in small towns and rural areas.  
 LD 665 would amend th e timing of implementation of LD 2003, by pushing back the date by  which  
municipalities would be required to allow for the constr uction of increased numbers of dwelling units 
and accessory dwelling units  from Jul y 1, 2023,  to July 1, 2025. In the report from the Commission to 
Increase Housing Opportunities in Maine by Studying  Land Use Regulations and Short -term Rentals, 
 
the Commission noted that it chose the initial July 1, 2023,  date to allow time to adjust to the laws 
enacted under LD 2003. Maine is in immediate need of housing, and CEI sees no need for delaying the 
implemen tation of the laws enacted under LD 2003.  
 
LD 1154 would amend M.R.S.A. §4364 -B, sub -§3 so that municipalities  would not be required to change 
zoning ordinances to allow for accessory dwelling units. Allowing for the use of accessory dwelling units 
was flagged by the Commission as means of adapting zoning laws to increase affordable housing. Making 
the allowance for accessory dwelling units an optional change under these laws only serves to undercut 
LD 2003’s original purpose of expanding access to affordable housing Maine.  
 We urge you to oppose  LD 214, LD 665, and LD 1154. Thank you for considering this testimony.
