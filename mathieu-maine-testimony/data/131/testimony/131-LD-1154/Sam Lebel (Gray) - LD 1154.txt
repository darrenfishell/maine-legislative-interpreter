LD 1154
 I am writing to oppose LD 1154. ADU's are a proven, low-impact, and 
common-sense approach. LD 2003 was thoughtfully crafted and already went through
an extensive process with a lot of compromise/revisions. Don't water down this 
important bill even more because certain municipalities are scared of change. There is
no bigger issue pressing Mainers right now than housing - please do not take away 
critical tools that help put a roof over people's heads.
