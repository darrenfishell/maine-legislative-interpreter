Testimony of Dennis Abbott Chair, Board of Selectmen, Waterboro, Maine 
before the Housing Committee in Support of 
LD 1154, An Act "An Act Regarding Accessory Dwelling Units and Municipal 
Zoning Ordinances" 
April 11, 2023 
 
Distinguished members of the Joint Committee on Housing, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on this legislation. My name is Dennis Abbott, and I serve as the 
Chair of the Board of Selectmen in Waterboro. 
 
I am glad to testify in support of LD 1154, "An Act Regarding Accessory Dwelling Units 
and Municipal Zoning Ordinances" 
 
In the Town of Waterboro, like many municipalities in Maine, local rule is strong and 
exercised in many of our Ordinances specifically the Townâ€™s Zoning Ordinance.  
 
Our ordinance has served the Town well since 1977 when it was first adopted. Naturally, 
this ordinance has been altered many times over the past four plus decades as required 
to accommodate changes in recommendations by citizens, changes driven by 
comprehensive plans etc. 
 
There is one common theme that has prevailed in all of these changes. They all meet the 
home rule previsions provided in State Law. 
 
For the State of Maine to force change to our local Zoning Ordinances to accept 
Accessory Dwelling Units is not only contrary to Home Rule, but it also carries with it 
significant cost to every municipality within the State in planning, legal and processing 
fees. 
 
Our Municipality struggles like all Maine Towns to manage and balance the tax burden 
for our citizens. 
 
I ask for your support for this bill which allows a municipality to make their own decision 
on Accessory Dwelling Units. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony.
