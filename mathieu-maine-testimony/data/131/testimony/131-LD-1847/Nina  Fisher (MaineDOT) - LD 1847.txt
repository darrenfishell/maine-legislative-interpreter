Testimony of Nina Fish er 
Maine Department of Transportation  
Before the 131st Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on Environm ent and 
Natural Resources  
 
In Support  
 
LD 1847 
An Act to Modify the Visual Impact Standards for Offshore Wind Port Development  
_____________________________________________________________  
 
Senator Brenner , Representative Gramlich  and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Environment and Natural Resources , I am Nina Fisher , Deputy Commi ssioner  at 
MaineDOT .  MaineDOT submits this testimony in support of LD 1847, An Act to Modify the 
Visual Impact Standards for Offshore Wind Port Development.  
 
The provisions within LD 1847 remove barriers for permitting an offshore wind port facility.    
Specifically, it applies new visual impact standards when proposed offshore wind port facilities 
receive review.   
 
The State of Maine has ambitious goals to pr ovide clean and renewable energy in the effort to 
fight climate change.  Offshore wind is a key component of Maine achieving these goals  and 
extensive work has already been done  to support this initiative.  The State of Maine has a need 
for and will see s ignificant economic benefit from an offshore wind port facility to support the 
emerging offshore wind industry in the Gulf of Maine.  This facility will be used to fabricate and 
launch floating offshore wind foundations  and assemble the wind turbines to be  towed out to sea.  
There  are no adequate port facilities currently in Maine  to complete this work.   
 
An offshore wind  port facility in Maine will produce some of the tallest structures in the state.  
The visual impact standards currently in statu te create a barrier for constructing a new facility 
that will accommodate the fabrication  and assembly  of wind turbines.   
 
It is for these reason that we urge the committee to vote in favor of LD 1847. Thank you.
