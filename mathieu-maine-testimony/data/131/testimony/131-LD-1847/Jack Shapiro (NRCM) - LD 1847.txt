Offshore Wind Port Development  
 
To the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources  
 by Jack Shapiro, Climate and Clean Energy Program Director  
May 10 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Brenner , Representative Gramlich , and members of the E nvironment and Natural 
Resources  Committee , my name is Jack Shapiro, and I am the Climate and Clean Energy 
Director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine  (NRCM) . NRCM has been working for 
more than 60 years to protect, restore, and conserve Maine’s environment, on behalf of our 
25,000 members and supporters. NRCM testifies in support of LD 1 847, An Act to Modify the 
Visual Impact Standards for Offshore Wind Port Development.1 
 
Offshore wind will play a n essential role in meeting Maine’s climate and clean energy goals. 
Maine’s comprehensive climate action plan, Maine Won’t Wait , came out in 2020,2 and it clearly 
identifies electrification as Maine’s central strategy for shifting our energy use away from 
expensive and outdated fossil fuels toward clean and affordable energy technologies. We have 
the ability to meet most of our climate goals with technologies that exist right now, today: 
Renewable energy, electrified vehicles, heat pumps, battery storage, and flexible grid 
technologies. Critically, we need to source all of that new electricity demand for how we heat our 
homes and businesses, and how we fuel our cars and trucks from renewable sources at 
reasonable costs. This is where offshore wind comes in.  
 
Years of work have gone into setting the stage for offshore wind development in Maine, 
including developing cutting -edge technologies at the University of Maine,3 and a mul ti-year 
Offshore Wind Roadmap strategy developed by the Governor’s Energy Office.4 The federal 
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is planning lease sales in the Gulf of Maine as 
early as next year.5 There is offshore wind procurement legislation up  for consideration this 
legislative session as well.6

 The importance of constructing a floating offshore wind terminal (or “port”) in Maine can’t  be 
overstated. Without a port, the economic benefits of offshore wind largely would not be realized 
in Maine. A report developed to support the Offshore Wind Roadmap estimated that Maine 
could experience up to 33,000 short -term and 13,000 long -term jobs f rom the development of an 
offshore wind industry. But those estimates rely on modeling a significant “local share” of 
economic benefits, workforce development, and supply chain participation. Without a port, that 
local share happens somewhere else. The sam e study estimated the economic impact of offshore 
wind development with a significant local share — consistent with having a Maine offshore wind 
port — as being more than triple that without it.7 
 
This bill advances the construction of an offshore wind po rt designed to support the construction 
of floating offshore wind platforms and turbines — the only kind suitable for the deep waters of 
the Gulf of Maine. Floating ports have different requirements than ports designed to support 
traditional “ fixed -bottom” offshore wind development. Floating turbines are erected on 
foundations in port, then towed out to sea. That requires tall cranes  to lift components to the top 
of the very large turbine towers. By making narrow and targeted changes to Maine’s  permitting 
laws, LD 1847 clears the path for the development of an offshore wind port, with all of the 
economic and climate benefits that it will enable.  
 
Importantly, LD 1847 also sets aside the question of specific siting. The Offshore Wind Port 
Advisory Group (OSWPAG), led by the Maine Department of Transportation (MDOT), has been 
charged with evaluating the multiple technical, environmental, and economic considerations for 
recommending a site for an offshore wind port and we believe their work should be allowed to 
proceed toward a recommendation later this year.8 
 
NRCM supports the development of responsibly developed offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine, 
including a responsibly developed offshore wind port. We believe this legislation supports that 
goal, so we support LD 1847, and encourage the Committee to do the same.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.
