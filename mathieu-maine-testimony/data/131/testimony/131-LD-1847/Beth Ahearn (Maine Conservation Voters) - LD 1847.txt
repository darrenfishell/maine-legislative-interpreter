“An Act to Modzfy the Vzsual Impact Standards

Before the Envlromnent and Natural Resources Commlttee 
May 10, 2023 
Good day, Senator Brenner, Representat1ve Graml1ch, and members of the Envlronment 
and Natural Resources Commlttee My name 1s Beth Ahearn and I am the dlrector of 
government affalrs for Mame Conservat1on Voters (MCV) MCV 1s a nonproﬁt 
organ1zat1on dedlcated to protectlng Ma1ne’s envlronment, democracy, and clnnate 
future Today we are testlfymg 1n support of LD 1847, and commend the Department of 
Envrronmental Protectron for craftlng thrs b1ll as well as Senator Curry for presentmg 1t 
We belleve that offshore w1nd 1s a cr1t1cal component for Mame to trans1t1on to a clean 
energy economy and for us to meet our ambltrous greenhouse gas reductron and clean 
energy goals Mame can beneﬁt economlcally as well as envlromnentally 1f we develop 
offshore wmd and ports to support that mdustry Many good pay1ngJobs<w1ll be created 
that can support Ma1ne fam1l1es But the current S1te Law vlsual 1mpact standards would 
proh1b1t offshore w1nd ports from bemg pernntted because the cranes and the w1nd 
turblnes are so tall Cranes to assemble offshore wlnd components are 750 feet h1gh and 
W1nd turblnes can be as tall as 850 feet These would not hkely ﬁt “hannonlously mto the 
exlstmg natural envrromnent ” nor would they “not adversely affect exlstmg uses and 
scemc characterl ’ , the vlsual 1mpact standards 1n the Slte Law 
LD 1847 would NOT requlre the DEP (or LUPC) to determme that an offshore wmd 
termlnal meets the current vlsual 1mpact standards 1n the S1te Law It would requ1re that' 
adverse lmpacts on scemc character are “m1n1m1zed to the maxlmum extent poss1ble ” and 
that the “best practrcal m1t1gat1on ” 1s used to reduce vlsual or scen1c nnpacts Thls change 
1n the standards 1s necessary 1f We are gomg to bulld an offshore w1nd rndustry
\
We 1n the envlronmental comrnumty have been good at saylng no As B1ll McK1bben 
recently wrote 1n Mother Jones magaz1ne, “It’s t1me progresslves hke me leamed to love’ 
the green bu1ld1ng boom we’re at a hmge moment now, when solvrng our brggest 
problems —env1ronmental but also soc1al—means we need to say yes to some thmgs 
solar panels and w1nd turb1nes and factones to make batterres and mmes to extract 
lrthrum ” In the artrcle, McK1bbon wrote about a wmd farm proposed on a beloved 
mountam which was defeated on aesthetlc grounds but for h1m “the challenge to the 
character of the place I loved came from not bulldrng these w1nd turb1nes ” because 
chmate change poses a much b1gger threat to the trees and the mountam He states that 
“some NIMBY (Not 1n My Backyard) passron W111 need to be replaced by some YIMBY 
(Yes 1n My Backyard) enthusrasm”

We ask you to show some YIMBY enthuslasm and support the changes to the Srte Law 
and the Natural Resources Protectlon Act that w1ll allow us to bu1ld offshore w1nd and 
beneﬁt the planet
