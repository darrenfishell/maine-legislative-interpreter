RE:
LD
1847,
An
Act
to
Modify
the
V isual
Impact
Standards
for
Offshor e
W ind
Port
Development
Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1847,
An
Act
to
Modify
the
V isual
Impact
Standards
for
Of fshore
W ind
Port
Development
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
Maine
Audubon
is
a
strong
supporter
of
of fshore
wind
development
in
the
Gulf
of
Maine
as
a
leading
strategy
to
help
Maine
achieve
its
climate
and
clean
ener gy
goals.
The
potential
for
of fshore
wind
ener gy
development,
using
floating
technology ,
is
far
greater
than
any
other
renewable
ener gy
source
–
an
estimated
156
gigawatts
of
ener gy
per
year ,
more
than
70
times
the
amount
of
electricity
used
by
the
entire
state
of
Maine.
As
a
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat
conservation
or ganization,
our
staf f
biologists
and
policy
team
are
actively
understanding,
researching,
and
pursuing
strategies
to
ensure
that
all
reasonable
ef forts
are
made
to
avoid,
minimize,
and
mitigate
impacts
from
of fshore
wind
development
on
the
Gulf
of
Maine
environment.
W e’re
also
pursuing
strategies
to
ensure
Maine’ s
people
and
economy
benefit
from
this
new
development.
LD
1847
would
help
Maine
realize
those
benefits.
LD
1847
would
make
narrowly
tailored
changes
to
Maine’ s
existing
W ind
Ener gy
Act
and
permitting
laws
to
allow
for
the
creation
of
of fshore
wind
terminals
(also
known
as
ports).
W e
believe
that
the
proposed
changes
are
crafted
in
such
a
way
that
maintains
the
integrity
of
the
W ind
Ener gy
Act,
as
well
as
“Site
Law”
and
the
Natural
Resources
Protection
Act,
while
avoiding
unintended
consequences.
That
said,
we
draw
the
Committee’ s
attention
to
the
proposed
definition
of
“of fshore
wind
terminal”.
W e
have
some
concern
that,
as
drafted,
the
definition
might
limit
the
ability
of
of fshore
wind
terminals
to
accept
parts
(nacelles,
blades,
etc.)
for
on-shore
wind
turbines.
Currently ,
the
Mack
Point
terminal
(and
likely
other
Maine
ports)
accept
on-shore
wind
turbine

parts.
There
may
be
ef ficiencies
in
allowing
the
same
to
occur
at
of fshore
wind
terminals
and
we
would
hate
for
the
bill
to
unwittingly
prevent
that
from
occurring.
Building
of fshore
wind
terminals
in
Maine
is
essential
to
Maine
realizing
the
full
economic
benefits
of
of fshore
wind
development
in
the
Gulf
of
Maine
and
beyond.
This
bill
supports
such
development
and
as
such,
Maine
Audubon
supports
this
legislation.
W e
encourage
the
Committee
to
do
the
same.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
