Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Chris Dupont and I live in Columbia Falls, Maine. I am a self-advocate and on the Board of 
Directors for Speaking Up For Us. I am testifying in support of LD 1666 because I think there should not 
be a penalty because two people with disabilities are married to each other, we should all be on the 
same playing field.   
This bill is important to me because it helps two of my friends because if we get rid of the marriage 
penalties, they will get some of their checks back.   If people want to get married in the future it will help 
them decide if they want to lose one of their incomes. It will affect my decision in the future about 
whether to get married because one of us will lose a large portion of our income. 
This bill will help me if I decide to get married in the future. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. I will be available to answer questions by email 
or phone. 
Sincerely, 
Chris Dupont 
Columbia Falls, ME
