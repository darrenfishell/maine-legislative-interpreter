Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Nicole Easler and I live in Presque Isle, Maine. I am a self-advocate and a member of 
Speaking Up For Us. I am testifying in support of LD 1666 because it is important because the cost of 
living has increased since the pandemic and even though the rate has increased starting in January 
people are still struggling. People who are married are discriminated against by having part of their 
check taken away. This is discrimination toward people who are married and is not fair that people who 
are disabled don’t have the same rights if they are married. 
This bill is important to me because myself and other people are struggling with the cost of living, and I 
know people who lost part of their benefits after they have gotten married. 
It could potentially give me a bit more money for the things I need and possibly save a bit for future and 
larger expenses. It will give other people a little extra money to live on and give back the income for 
those that are married. 
It will only hurt me if my rent is increased. If I get another 65.00 each month section 8 is going to take 
half of that and because of the increase in January of 75.00 my rent will be increased by 30.00 in 
December therefore my rent will increase by about 60.00 with both increases put together. This will 
mean that I could potentially have less money for other bills and necessities.   
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. I will be available to answer questions by email 
or phone. 
Sincerely, 
Nicole Easler
