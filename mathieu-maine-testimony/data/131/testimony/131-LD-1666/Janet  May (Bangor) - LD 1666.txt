LD 1666
Members of Maine's Committee on Health and Human Services, I am Janet May and 
I live in Bangor, Maine.  I am communicating with you today to provide my support 
for LD 1666, An Act To Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental Security 
Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives.  
The recommendations in this piece of legislation will provide some financial relief to 
people in Maine who have a disability and rely on state and federal benefits to pay 
their bills each month.  In the past year or so many of us have been impacted by cost 
increases across the board and people who have fewer resources to begin with are 
more severely affected.  The removal of marriage disincentives for people with 
disabilities is also a step in the right direction concerning equal treatment for people 
who choose to become married.  More needs to be done at the federal level 
concerning marriage, benefits and people with disabilities and perhaps Maine can 
shine a light on this issue and create needed change in DC too.  Thank you for your 
consideration.
