Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Sarah Trites and I live in Sabattus. I am a self-advocate and serve on the Board of Speaking 
Up For Us.  
I am in favor of LD 1666. I think this bill  would greatly help people who are on SSI. This could mean that 
people can marry who they want to and not lose money.   
Because the cost of living is so high, the cost of medical equipment is high and if you have less money, 
you are not able to purchase some of the equipment that you need to help you live as independently as 
you want to. I do know some stories of people who weren’t able to get married in other states because 
of the marriage penalty.  
This doesn’t necessarily affect me directly, because I have just straight social security. However, have 
many friends and fellow self-advocates who have gone through this. This will greatly help them live the 
lives the way they choose to live.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. I will be available to answer questions by email.  
Sincerely, 
Sarah Trites 
Sabattus, ME
