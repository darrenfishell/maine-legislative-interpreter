Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Jenna Deniger and I live in Cherryfield, Maine. I am a self-advocate and am currently 
involved with Speaking Up For Us. I am testifying in support of LD 1666 because it is important because I 
know some people that are struggling with the current bill that is in place right now and they get little to 
no income. I hope this is passed so that my friends and I can get the income that we need. 
This bill is also important to me because If I ever want to get married one day, I can still have an income 
that I can live on. If I didn’t have an income, I wouldn’t be able to get the things that I need. 
The people that I know get little or no income and this bill will provide them with the ability to get the 
things that they need whether that be things they need medically or things they need every day. 
Thank you for your time and consideration and working on this bill as well as the opportunity to submit 
my testimony. I will be available to answer questions in person, by email or by phone. 
Sincerely, 
Jenna Deniger
