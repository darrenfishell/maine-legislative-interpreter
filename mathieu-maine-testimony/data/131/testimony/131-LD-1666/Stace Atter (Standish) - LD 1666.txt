Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Stace Atter and I am a self-advocate. I am active in Speaking Up For Us. I am a person who 
lives with a disability.  
I would like this bill to pass. I currently receive SSDI, and though this bill is only for SSI I still think it is 
important for people to have an increase. Having access to more income would help me live a better 
life. It could help me save to go on vacation and visit with my family. They live too far away from me 
right now and getting there costs money.  
In the future I have thought about getting married. But the thought of losing my income would make me 
very angry. I would be irritated if I lost my income. I currently can’t work over 20 hours or I lose my 
benefits. I need my benefits because I live in shared living and I get community supports to live my life.  
I think self-advocates should be able to get married if they choose without having a penalty. I think self-
advocates should have the same rights as everyone else.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. I will be available to answer questions by email.  
Sincerely, 
Stace Atter
