Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Marco Orlando and I live in Brewer. I am a self-advocate and I am the Treasurer on the 
Board of Speaking Up For Us.  
I am someone who lives with a disability so I am on a limited income because of it. I am writing in 
support of LD 1666. I myself, am not in a position to where I can marry or raise a family. I don’t see that 
happening for me. I would love to see that happen for other people like me. I feel this ties in with my 
overall beliefs of challenging people’s perceptions of what they think people with disabilities are capable 
of.  
I often see people with disabilities settling for less than they deserve because society thinks that is what 
they can do/deserve. Because of this, a lot of folks miss out on the every day lifestyle that everyone 
takes for granted of marrying and raising a family. 
If that is what a person wants, they should be able to get married without losing income and benefits.  
I believe this bill should also further expand on language around the nursing home piece and expand it 
to people who live in shared living, group homes, etc.  
In general, I feel like people should be encouraged to take part in the every day lifestyle that everyone 
else does. They shouldn’t have to risk losing their benefits to do it.  
This legislation is a huge step toward leveling the playing field for people like us.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. I will be available to answer questions by email.  
Sincerely, 
Marco Orlando
