Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Brian Harnish and I live in Orono. I am a self-advocate and serve on the Board of Speaking 
Up For Us.  
I come from a place where I was engaged at one point but we couldn’t get married because she was 
able bodied and working full time. While I probably wouldn’t have lost my SSDI, I would have lost my 
Mainecare. I am in support of LD 1666.  
The percentage that Maine contributes to SSI not being updated since 1974 is ridiculous and really 
needs to be changed. Especially with the way the economy is currently.  
People not being able to live the way they want is obviously going to affect their mental health. I am also 
part of the Consumer Council System of Maine and mental health concerns are very important to me.  I 
don’t think the marriage penalty is right. It is an antiquated system and it is not giving people the 
opportunity to live life like they want to.  
It is limiting our abilities as persons with disabilities, which are already limited in certain ways. We don’t 
need to be limited more.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. I will be available to answer questions by email.  
Sincerely, 
Brian Harnish
