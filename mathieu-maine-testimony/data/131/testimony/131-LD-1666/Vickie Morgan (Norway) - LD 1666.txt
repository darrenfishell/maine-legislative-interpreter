Good Morning/Afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and esteemed 
members of the Health and Human Services Committee,  
My name is Vickie Morgan, I am a resident of Norway and I am here today to testify in 
favor of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage 
Disincentives”.
Supplemental Security Income is meant to protect older and disabled Americans from 
experiencing extreme proverty.
The poverty rate is much higher for married couples than it is for two individuals living in
the same household. For this reason, the State Supplement to Supplement Security 
Income should not be decreased for married couples. A couple who chooses to live 
together receives the same benefit amount as individuals. This discourages couples 
from getting married because of financial reasons, even though it is what they truly 
want.
If the benefit for married couples is the same for two individuals, this would lower their 
proverty rate and allow them to improve their lives 
In closing, I urge you to pass  LD 1666.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Vickie Morgan
