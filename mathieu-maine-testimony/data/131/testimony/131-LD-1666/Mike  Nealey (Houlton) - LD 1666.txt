Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Mike Nealey and I live in Houlton, Maine. I am a self-advocate and am currently on the 
Board of Directors for Speaking Up For Us. I am testifying in support of LD 1666 because an increase will 
help, it will help more if my rent does not increase and those with disabilities that want to get married 
should not lose part or all of their income.   
This bill is important to me because I know someone that lost a large portion of their income when they 
got married and If I decide to get married in the future, I will have to make my decision since I would 
lose a large portion of my income. If a couple with disabilities wants to get married it will inform them 
as to what their social security supplement will be. 
An increase in Social Security will be a good benefit supplement if my rent does not increase. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. I will be available to answer questions by phone 
or email.  
Sincerely, 
Mike Nealey 
Houlton, ME
