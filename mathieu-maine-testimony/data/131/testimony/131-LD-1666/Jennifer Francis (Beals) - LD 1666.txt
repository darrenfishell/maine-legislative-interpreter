Testimony in support of LD 1666 “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental 
Security Income by Updating the State Supplement and Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
My name is Jennifer Francis and I live in Beals, Maine. I am a self-advocate and currently becoming 
involved with Speaking Up For Us. I am testifying in support of LD 1666 because it is important because 
this bill takes away the disincentives for a couple for whom both receive social security income.  
I am a person who has a social security income because of my Intellectual disability and my husband 
Daniel Francis also is a person who has a social security income because of his Intellectual disability, and 
we would benefit from the income being updated to today’s standards.  With a little bit of extra income, 
I could afford the gluten-free diet that I cannot afford today due to my medical diagnosis. 
There is no reason why the income should be taken from people who get married. When you get 
married you still have bills to pay. People should not lose their money when they get married.  
This bill is important to me because I know that there are people that would like to have more spending 
money.  I can’t believe they took the money from our income, to begin with. 
This bill will help me:  It will help us have a little more money at the end of the month to help us with 
our expenses. This bill will help others:  Other people can have more money to pay for their expenses 
and it will allow them to save a little bit and it won’t take so long to save for the things they need. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. I will be available to answer questions by email 
or phone. 
Sincerely, 
Jennifer Leigh Francis
