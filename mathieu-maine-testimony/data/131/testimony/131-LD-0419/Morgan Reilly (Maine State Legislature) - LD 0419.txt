LD 419, “Resolve, To Initiate a Working Group to Evaluate Solutions for Polling Places at 
Schools to Protect Security and Accessibihty ” 
Before the Jomt Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Aﬂairs 
Good moming Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and fellow members of the Jomt 
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs I am Morgan Rielly, and I represent House 
District 127, which includes pait of Westbrook Thank you for the opportimity to introduce LD 
419, “Resolve, To Initiate a Working Group to Evaluate Solutions for Polling Places at 
Schools to Protect Security and Accessibility ” for your consideration 
LD 419 was a concept draft put in on behalf of the Secretary of State’s ofﬁce The amended 
language shared with this committee seeks to establish a workmg group that will bring together 
stakeholders to look into solutions for pollmg places at schools because of concerns raised by 
some communities From my conversations with the Secretary of State’s ofﬁce, one possible 
solution they are speciﬁcally looking at 1S making Election Day an in-service day at schools so 
students would have the day oﬁ‘ but would like to work with stakeholders to come to a more 
collaborative solution1 
As you all know, many of our communities use schools as a polling place, and m some cases this 
is the sole polling location They have accessible parking, are ADA compliant, and have the 
space for large amounts of people to pass through Schools also already require strong security to 
protect students and teachers 
This study would give supenntendents, the Secretary of State’s office, and stakeholders further 
time to discuss a statewide ni-service day on Election Day and come up with guidelines if 
deemed necessary 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration The Secretary of State’s ofﬁce will be 
hear to answer any questions about the bill and the working group
