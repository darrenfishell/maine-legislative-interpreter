LD 419 - An Act to Ensure Polling Place Security
Addressing the chairman and members of the Committee, 
I oppose LD419, The State of Maine Elections already have Security in the Polling 
Places. This is an attempt to sway the polls to the liking of the Democrat Party 
pleasures. The Secretary of State and the Maine House and Senate majority, being 
Democrat, is pushing their agendas to curtail the process of an honest and legal 
election. 
Rule 208. Requirements for Drafting. A request for a bill or resolve filed with the 
Revisor of Statutes is considered complete when the request is properly titled and 
accompanied by sufficient instructions, information and data required for its 
preparation.
This is not needed and a waste of the public hearings time and paperwork.
