LD 419
I'm contacting you concerning LD 419, An Act to Ensure Polling Place Security.
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208. This bill proposes to require the
Department of the Secretary of State to develop and implement practices that would 
enhance secure voting and election activities at polling places. That's all there is?
How am I, or anyone else, suppose to participate in our legislative process when the 
actual text of this bill is being hidden from "We The People"? How am I, or anyone 
else, suppose to have an informed opinion concerning this bill when the actual text of 
this bill is being hidden from "We The People"? 
You leave me no other choice but to oppose this bill and I urge the committee to vote 
"Ought Not to Pass" on LD 419.
