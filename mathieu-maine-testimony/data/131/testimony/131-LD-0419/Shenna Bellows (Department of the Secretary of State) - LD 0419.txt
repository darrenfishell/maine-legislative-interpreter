L D 419, “Resolve, To In1t1ate a Workmg Group to Evaluate Soluttons for Polhng Places at Schools to 
Protect Securlty and Access1b1l1ty ” 
Senator H1ckman, Representatlve Sup1ca and Members of the Jo1nt Standmg Commlttee on Veterans 
and Legal Affalrs, my name 1s Shenna Bellows and I am the Secretary of State and the ch1efelect1ons 
ofﬁcer I am speak1ng today 1n support of L D 419 
We apprecrate the b1ll sp0nsor’s w1ll1ngness to subm1t th1s resolve on the depa1tment ’s behalf 
At 1ts core, th1s b1ll 1s about elect1on 1ntegr1ty because havlng dependable, access1ble poll1ng places 
only bolsters the safety and secunty of our e1ect1ons In many mun1c1pal1t1es around our state, a school 
bu1ld1ng 1s often the only place equ1pped to hold an elect1on due to 1ts locat1on and the fact that 1t 1s 
already compl1ant w1th the Amencans w1th D1sab1l1t1es Act Yet, 1n some towns we are seelng 
mumclpal leaders and school ofﬁc1als express concerns over the log1st1cs of h0st1ng an electlon on 
school property 
L D 419 would brmg together lmportant stakeholders l1ke mun1c1pal clerks, school admlnlstrators, and 
elect1on ofﬁclals to d1scuss and determ1ne the feas1b1l1ty of havlng more school bu1ld1ngs across the 
state become permanent polllng locatlons 1n thelr town or mun1c1pal1ty Th1s goal 1s especlally 
lmportant glven the varlous electlons that w1ll be held 1n 2024 for wh1ch we expect hlgh voter turnout 
In order to come to the best dec1s1on poss1ble w1th regards to poll1ng locatlons 1n schools, 1t 1s 
lmportant that those who would be lmpacted and have dec1s1on-makmg authorlty are part of these 
d1SCLlSS1011S If th1s resolve 1s enacted, we look forward to reportlng back to th1s comm1ttee 1n 2024 
Th1s concludes my test1mony Thank you and I would be happy to answer any questlons that the 
cornmrttee may have
