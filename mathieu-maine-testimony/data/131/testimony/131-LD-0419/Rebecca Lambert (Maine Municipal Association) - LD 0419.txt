In Support of  
 
LD 419 - An Act to Ensure Polling Place Security  
 
May 17 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, and I am providing testimony in support of LD 419 on behalf of 
the Maine Municipal Association’s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For 
reference , the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills 
of municipal interest.    
Maine’s dedicated election workers  take the act of conducting elections very seriously  and any 
attempt to provide an atmosphere that is safe, welcoming and free from harassment  or intimidation  for 
citizens to cast their ballot is encouraged by municipal of ficials.  
The amendment presented for LD 419 would establish a working group to study the options to 
protect security of students and voters and polling place accessibility, with MMA being a member of this working group. Polling place security is important  to local leaders and our affiliate group organizations 
and is essential to democracy. To that end, MMA would be happy to participate in the working group.  
Thank you for your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
