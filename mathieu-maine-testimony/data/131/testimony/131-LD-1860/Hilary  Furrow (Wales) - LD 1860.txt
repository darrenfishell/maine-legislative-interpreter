Dear Committee Members, 
I am a homeschool parent, who was also educated at home in Maine. I value the 
freedom to creatively teach my children within the reasonable parameters that the 
state currently requires. Personally, I oppose any school choice legislation that 
attaches government funding to my childâ€™s education. By choosing to homeschool, I 
am intentionally opting out of the government system for education, and I would like 
to keep it that way. Please be keep home education entirely out of this bill. Thank 
you.
