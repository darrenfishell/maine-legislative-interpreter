Testimony in support of LD 1860 "An Act to Create the Educational Opportunity 
Account Program"
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and the distinguished members of the 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is William Smith, I live in 
Gorham and am a strong educational support and freedom.
As a previous educator I think the support and flexibility created by this bill would 
strongly enable students to further their commitments to long term plans in order to 
reach a more educationally rich life. 
So I ask you vote SHALL PASS for LD 1860. 
Thank you.
