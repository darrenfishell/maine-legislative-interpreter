Honorable Members of the Educational & Cultural Affairs Committee
Thank you for serving Maine citizens. I am writing to ask you to vote Ought NOT to 
Pass on LD 1798 and LD 1860. 
Homeschooling has always flourished without government funding and will continue 
to do so. Right now, Maine families have the freedom to choose home school 
curricula that are tailored specifically to each individual child's diverse talents and 
special needs. Maine parents can also incorporate their particular beliefs into the 
curriculum, whether those beliefs are secular or faith-based. Parents can incorporate 
the teachings of the Bible, Koran, Torah, etc into their homeschool studies if they so 
choose.
Government funding for homeschooling invites the government to mandate 
curriculum ideals and standards. The state's aptitude test scores indicate that 
cookie-cutter curriculum standards found in public schools are failing our students. 
Maine's class of 2022 average SAT scores are in the bottom 20% of US states 
(https://www.number2.com/average-sat-score/). Homeschooling is becoming 
increasingly popular in the wake of the pandemic and it should be allowed to continue
to grow, untouched. The current law ensures that students are progressing through 
age-appropriate milestones as a Maine licensed teacher must certify that the education
requirements are being met. Alternatively, homeschooled students can participate in 
standardized testing to demonstrate educational progress. 
Please vote Ought NOT to Pass on LD 1798 and LD 1860 and continue to allow 
Maine families the freedom to select the curriculum that fits their children and allows 
each child to flourish in their own individual, diverse strengths.
Respectfully submitted,
Nathan Persinger
