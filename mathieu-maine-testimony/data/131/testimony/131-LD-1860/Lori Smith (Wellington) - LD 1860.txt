LD 1860
I have been involved in homeschooling in Maine since the 1980s. The homeschool 
freedoms that we implemented then contribute to some of the best adults today. 
Homeschoolers don't want to lose our freedoms for money. Home educators in Maine 
do not want this bill. As a private tutor, I also don't want to risk being told what to 
teach if I have a student paying me with government money. I understand that the 
heart behind these bills is to try and help, but please understand that we don't see this 
as a help. Please eliminate home educators, both as students and service providers, 
from your education bills. 
Please oppose LD 1798 and 1860. Homeschooling has always flourished without 
government funding, and it will continue to do so.
