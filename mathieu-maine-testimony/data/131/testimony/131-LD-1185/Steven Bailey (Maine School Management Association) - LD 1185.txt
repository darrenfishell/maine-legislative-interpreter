TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 1185  
 
AN ACT TO AUTHORIZE A GENERAL FUND BOND ISSUE TO RECAPITALIZE  
THE SCHOOL REVOLVING RENOVATION FUND  
 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and members of the Committee on Appropriations and Financial 
Affairs . I am Steven Bailey , execu tive director  of Maine School Management Association testifyin g on behalf 
of the legislative  committees of the Maine School Superintendents Association and the Maine School Boards 
Associatio n, in support of L.D. 1185. 
 
Maine school buildings are getting old, and the waiting list for construction funds is long. The last time 
applications were acc epted, 74 schools applied, but less than a handful made the lis t. These were new 
construction project s. Repairs t o buildings awaiting replacement could be addressed if there was  additiona l 
funding in the School Revolving Renovation Fun d. We also testifi ed in support of L .D. 193 which  also is an 
attempt to place  additiona l funds in the  School Revolving Renovation Fund  for the repair of Maine’s schools.  
 
L.D. 1185 recognizes the need to address our aging schools, through renovation s. It would allow for t he 
issuance of $100,000,000 in bonds that could be accessed by school administrative units through the  School 
Revolvin g Renovation Fund application process . These bonds would  greatly provid e for renovation and  
capital repairs to the school s. This year a lone,  34 projects  had approved loan s ranging from $7,548 to 
$1,000,00 0. There were many, many more request s. The greatest  average age of Maine’s schools is between 
60 – 70 year s. If you have been  in some of our schools recently, you can see why this req uest is necessary . 
 
The bonds would have to be approved by the voters in a statewide election, therefore it would be known t here 
was majority support of this effor t. 
 
MSSA and MSBA both urge the  Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs an O TP vote on L .D. 
1185.
