Maine Indoo r Air Quality Council Testimony  in Support of LD 1185:  
An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Recapitalize the  
School Revolving Renovation Fund  
 
The Maine Indoor  Air Quality Council (“MIAQC” or the “Council” ) is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit 
organization  dedicated to creating healthy, productive and environmentally sustainable  
indoor environments in M aine.  Our efforts focus on the development of education , 
communications , and advocacy for safe and healthy indoor environments where Maine 
citizens live, work, play and learn.  
 
Dear Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs , and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Appropriations & Financial Affairs : 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality  Council supports LD 1185: An Act to Authorize a General 
Fund Bond Issue to Recapitalize the School Revolving Renovation Fund (RRF).   Since its 
inception, the RRF has prioritized fund expenditures for health & safety and indoor air 
quality concerns.   
Howe ver, we do have a r ecommendation:  We would encourage this committee to 
consider adding ventilation upgrades as a specific fund priority .   
 
 If nothing else, the COVID -19 global pandemic has raised awareness of indoor air 
quality . We now understand there a re things in the indoor air we can’ t see, smell or 
taste , yet they can still  make us sick.   
 The primary tool in the building management toolbox to reduce the risk of exposure to 
airborne pollutants is mechanical ventilation.   
 Maine has a large number of schools that were constructed before the development of 
minimum acceptable ventilation standards . 
 There are a large number of Maine schools that have no mechanical ventilation systems 
at all.   
 Numerous studies show a direct link between adequate mechanical ventilation and 
stude nt and staff learning and productivity.  
Should you wish to learn more, a copy of the Council’s own best practice guideline on 
school air quality is available her e.  I also recommend explor ing the resources available 
at the U.S. EPA’s school IAQ website .
