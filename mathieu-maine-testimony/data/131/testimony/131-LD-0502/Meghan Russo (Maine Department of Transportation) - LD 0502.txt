Testimony of Meghan Russo 
Maine Department of Transportation 
Before the 131"‘ Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
Neither For Nor Against 
LD 502 
Resolve, Designating the Deserz‘ of Maine Overpass the Matthew MacMilZan 
Overpass 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation, l am Meghan Russo, Legislative Liaison for the 
Maine Department of Transportation. MaineDOT is neither for nor against LD 502, 
Resolve, Designating the Desert of Maine Overpass the Matthew MacMillan Overpass. 
MaineDOT considers the naming of bridges, roadways, and other state transportation 
infrastructure to be within the purview of the Legislature. Simply put, we build them and 
you name them. Accordingly, we generally do not take positions on so-called “naming 
bills.” However, we do submit written testimony regarding whether the particular 
infrastructure under consideration has been named before, and if so what those name(s) 
are. In this case, we are not aware of any previous legislatively-sanctioned names for this 
bridge. MaineDOT ’s current inventory number for this structure is 5741. 
We hope this information is helpful. Thank you.
