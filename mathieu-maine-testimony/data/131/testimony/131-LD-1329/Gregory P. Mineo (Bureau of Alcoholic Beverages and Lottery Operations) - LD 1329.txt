Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
LD I329 — “An Act to Allow Delivery of Craft Beer” 
April 10, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs, my name is Gregg Mineo and I am the Director of the Bureau of 
Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations. I am providing the following testimony in 
opposition to LD 1329. 
LD 1329 proposes to allow a small brewery or a third-party contractor of a small brewery to 
deliver containers of malt liquor produced by the brewery to a consumer twenty-one years of age 
or older who provides acceptable identiﬁcation. 
This bill likely violates the Dormant Commerce Clause because it discriminates against out-of- 
state manufacturers of malt liquor. The bill only allows in-state small breweries, or their third- 
party contractor to deliver beer directly to consumers. Out-of-state breweries of any size would 
have to distribute through the state’s three-tier system — manufacturer to distributor to retailer. 
According to the US Supreme Court in Granholm v. Heald, “(I)n all but the narrowest 
circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce Clause if they mandate ‘different treatment of in- 
state and out-of-state economic interests that beneﬁts the former and burdens the latter.”’ 
Additional concerns unrelated to constitutionality + the bill would allow small breweries" to use a" 
third-party contractor to deliver products to consumers. It does not appear that these contractors 
must be licensed as wholesalers under title 28-A, chapter 55. Allowing unlicensed “contractors ” 
to distribute malt liquor would further frustrate the state’s three-tier system, which is designed to 
protect consumers and public health. 
Thank you for allowing me to testify before the Committee today. I am happy to answer any 
questions, and of course will be available for the work session.
