LD 870
Wealthy people and powerful organizations often use SLAPPs to silence investigative
reporting, burying journalists and their newsrooms in legal fees and making them 
think twice about publishing the next exposé. In short, SLAPPs pose a serious threat 
to journalism and the public’s right to know.
There is currently no federal law aimed at protecting journalists and others against 
these dangerous lawsuits. I support Maine bill LD 870 "An Act to Strengthen 
Freedom of Speech Protections by Extending Laws Against Strategic Lawsuits 
Against Public Participation".
