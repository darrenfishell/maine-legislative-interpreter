AMERICAN CIVIL UBERTIES UNION 
Maine 
TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ. 
LD 870 — Ought To Pass 
An Act to Strengthen Freedom of Speech Protections by Extending Laws 
Against Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation- 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
_ April 3, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, greetings. My name is Michael Kebede, and I am 
Policy Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our members, I urge you to support 
LD 870, legislation that expands Maine’s anti-SLAPP law to protect statements 
made in news publications, and any statement made in public on issues of public 
interest.'
l 
Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation are frivolous lawsuits intended to 
punish speech protected by the First Amendment. These lawsuits clog up our 
already burdened courts and can scare people from exercising their constitutional 
rights. Anti-SLAPP statutes remedy those harms by making it possible for courts to 
quickly dismiss SLAPP suits. Nonetheless, in 2017, the Law Court determined that 
Maine’s anti-SLAPP law does not protect most statements made in media 
publications.1 That decision placed Maine in the minority of states with such laws. 
Most anti-SLAPP statutes throughout the country apply to statements made in 
newspapers, because courtsacknowledge that the statutes must “protect against 
lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights . . ., 
- 
this purpose would not be served if’ the statutes are inapplicable to newspapers or 
other public media? This bill properly brings statements made in media 
publications back into the protection of the statute, a necessary First Amendment 
protection and correction of the Law Court’s finding. 4r 
Maine’s anti-SLAPP statute also currently does not apply to statements made at 
public protests, government reports on government activity,3 or statements not

directed at' 
a government entity/1 even though those statements may be vital to the 
public interest and a valid exercise of constitutional rights. On‘ this count, too, this 
bill corrects Maine’s precedent and properly expands the statute to protect all 
statements made in public on matters of public interest.5 
We urge you to vote ought to pass.

Hearts with Haiti, Inc. v. Kendrick, 2019 ME 26, ﬁl 13 202 A.3d 1189 (ﬁnding defendant ’s statements did not fall 
into anti-SLAPP statute because, in part, they were not directed at any government entity). 5 
However, this bill does not address the biggest problem facing Maine’s anti-SLAPP statute: the Law Court’s repeated alteration of the standard parties must meet when using the statute. The Law Court has changed the standard four times in twenty-two years, each time shifting the burden the parties must meet and each time ﬁndinga constitutional error in their previous standard. Morse Bros., Inc. v. Webster, 2001 ME 70,11 19, 772 A.2d 842 overruled by Nader v. Me. Democratic Party, 2012 ME S7, 41 A.3d 551, overruled by Gaudette v. Davis, 2017 ME 86, 160 A.3d 1190, overruled by Thurlow v. Nelson, 2021 ME 58, 263 A.3d 494. The current standard is now the same standard the Law Court adopted in 2012—which the Law Court also found unconstitutional in 2017. T hurlow, 2021 ME 58, 1] 19. This shifting ground makes it difficult for any person using Maine’s anti-SLAPP law to know where they stand and how to best make their case. We encourage this committee to consider further amending this statute to reﬂect the procedure courts should utilize when applying the statute.
