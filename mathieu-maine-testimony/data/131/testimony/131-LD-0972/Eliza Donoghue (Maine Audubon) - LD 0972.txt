Resolve,
Directing

to
Evaluate
Strategies
for
Improving
the
Returnable
Beverage
Container
Laws
Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
972,
Resolve,
Directing
the
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
to
Evaluate
Strategies
for
Improving
the
Returnable
Beverage
Container
Laws,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members
and
supporters.
Maine
Audubon
is
proud
to
have
stood
amongst
the
many
advocates
for
Maine’ s
original
“Bottle
Bill”
over
40
years
ago.
In
1976,
our
then
assistant
director
Bill
Ginn
logged
over
7,000
miles
driving
around
the
state,
speaking
to
up
to
five
audiences
a
day
on
behalf
of
the
measure.
In
the
end,
the
referendum
passed
comfortably ,
58
percent
to
42
percent.
When
the
law’ s
opponents
forced
yet
another
referendum
two
years
later ,
84
percent
of
voters
chose
to
keep
it
in
place.
By
all
measures,
Maine’ s
returnable
beverage
container
laws
have
been
a
success.
Research
has
consistently
shown
that
bottle
redemption
laws
are
highly
successful
in
reducing
litter .
A
study
in
Maine
after
the
law
went
into
ef fect
found
that
beverage
container
litter
dropped
69
to
77
percent.
In
general,
states
with
redemption
laws
have
been
found
to
experience
a
75
to
80
percent
return
rate
on
redeemable
containers
-
meaning
the
vast
majority
of
beverage
containers
going
out
are
making
their
way
back
after
use.
In
addition
to
its
environmental
benefits,
Maine’ s
bottle
bill
supports
small
businesses,
like
redemption
centers.
It
reduces
the
costs
to
communities
of
collecting
and
recycling
these
containers
and
it
supports
local
fundraising
ef forts
through
bottle
bills.
Given
the
passage
of
time,
however ,
Maine
Audubon
believes
that
there
is
room
for
improvement.
LD
972
directs
the
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
to
convene
a
stakeholder
group
to
develop
recommendations
to
“update”
Maine’ s
laws
governing
the
recycling
of
returnable
beverage
containers.
This
group
will
consider
the
fact
that
the
number
of

brands
of
beverages
in
returnable
containers
that
require
individual
sorting
has
increased
exponentially ,
increasing
the
labor
necessary
for
handling
containers;
that
rent,
utilities,
and
labor
costs
for
redemption
centers
have
risen;
and
that
there
have
been
technology
advances
since
the
1970s,
and
more.
The
redemption
rate
in
Maine
ranges
from
67
to
85
percent,
depending
on
the
type
of
container
and
initiator
of
deposit.
Michigan,
for
example,
has
a
ten
cent
deposit
on
cans
experiences
close
to
a
95
percent
return
rate
(Maine’ s
is
five
cents).
There
is
room
for
improvement.
W e
encourage
the
Committee
to
support
this
bill
and
look
forward
to
learning
about
the
outcome
of
the
stakeholder
group.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
