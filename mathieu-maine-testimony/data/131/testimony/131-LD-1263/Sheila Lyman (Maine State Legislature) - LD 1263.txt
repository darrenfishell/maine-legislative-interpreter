TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF LD 1263 
An Act to Require School Identification Cards to Include the Telephone 
Number of a Suicide Prevention Hotline. 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed colleagues on the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee - 
It is an honor to come before you today to present LD l263, An Act to 
Require School Identification Cards to Include the Telephone Number ofa 
Suicide Prevention Hotline, along with the Honorable MaryAnne Kinney. 
To me, this is not a complicated bill but one that could certainly offer 
lifesaving contact for an at risk student. You may be aware that a similar 
bill was a priority in our neighboring State of New Hampshire, ultimately 
being signed into law last August. That bill did, and this bill would, require 
all public schools that issue student IDs to include the National Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline number on them. 
I would like LD 1263 to include language in the bill that says, “any student 
ID cards for sixth grade through college age must include the 988 and/or I- 
800-2 73-8255 number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. ” If 
passed, this law would apply to public and charter schools as well as public 
and private universities in our state. Any individual that calls that number is 
routed to their closest area code, not necessarily their physical 
address. Callers ﬁnd immediate HELP. 
Every student needs equal access to vital support and counsel in a life- 
threatening situation. This bill would establish one more critical opportunity 
to save a life. It offers another way of addressing our mental health 
challenges. If this bill saves a single life, it is worth it!
