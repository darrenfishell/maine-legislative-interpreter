Esteemed Committee Members,
My name is Ron Greco and I run Moose Maine Kids.  MMK is a 501c3 non-profit with a sole 
goal of increasing youth participation rates in traditional outdoor activities like hunting and 
fishing.  We do not support LD 482.
LD 482 extends the youth season for kids at a time when they should be in school.  This bill is 
misdirected in its attempt to create a greater opportunity for youth to participate in hunting.  This 
is particularly painful in light of Maine’s Sunday hunting ban.  Sunday is a family day and kids 
are not in school.  Sunday would be the day to add to the youth season in order to get kids more 
involved in the woods.  Asking families to choose education or hunting is the wrong thing to do.  
It sends a very damaging message to our youth’s that education is not important.
Please vote this bill down in favor of LD 672 which would have a far greater impact in 
increasing the opportunities for kids as well send the message that education is extremely 
important.
Sincerely,
Ron Greco
