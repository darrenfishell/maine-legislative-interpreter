Honorable Committee Members of Maine's IF&W Department:
It seems every year, we add on more days to the deer hunting season.
And although I strongly support deer hunting, I do not support everything about it that
is allowed...from hunting a half hour after sunset (it was always up until sunset when I
was young) to a child of any age being allowed to carry a lethal firearm into our 
woods to shoot an animal...to the use of silencers at night.
The extra week for children is inevitably an extra week for the adults that accompany 
them. That being said, when I wanted to go hunting with my Dad, on a school day, I 
simply skipped school !  And therein lie some of my best memories. A day off from 
school...to walk in the woods with my Dad and to drive up-country...and Mom would 
write the excuse. It was marvelous ! An extra week in October avails kids nothing 
different. They will still have to skip school !  
So let's not take away what little time the non-consumptive sports people have... the 
equestrians, hikers, photographers, bird-watchers, strolling elderly, kayakers, canoe 
paddlers ...those who enjoy our woods and waters without the concern of rifles and 
gun-shots. The beauty of Maine's woods in October is infamous. It is also fast fading 
and those days are precious to us all. 
Also: A full week following the Special Youth Hunting Day will mean that the Maine
Residence's Only hunting day...which used to be "Opening Day" will be a bit tainted 
by now having the deer become "jumpy" from all the gunshots and unusual 
foot-traffic that occurred during the Special Youth Hunting Week (+ 1 ).  
Deer hunters have a many more days than ever before, and more ways than ever 
before, to hunt and kill a deer. Let's be equally considerate of the landowners, 
citizenry and sportsmen of all different ilks as well.  And let's not take away the perks 
of the Maine Residence Only Day.  
Thank you.
