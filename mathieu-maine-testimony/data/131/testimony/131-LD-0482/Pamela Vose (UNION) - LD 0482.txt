LD 482
TO: Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
March 27, 2023
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident of Union.  
I am submitting testimony against LD 482 - An Act to Extend the Time for Youth Deer Hunting
I would like to start out by saying that I am not anti hunting and appreciate the 
traditions of hunting passed on by generations in my family.   I speak as a citizen and 
landowner who appreciates, uses and has a need to be in the woods during deer 
hunting season and finds the ever expanding firearms season to be a concern.  There 
are many of us who have other reasons to be out in our beautiful Maine woods during 
the fall and cannot do so safely during deer hunting season.  We are as important as 
hunters and deserve consideration 
Young people already have a day set aside for their own in October. This year it is 
October 21.  Expanding this to a full six days extends the time we cannot be safely 
enjoying the woods at one of the nicest recreational and most productive work times 
of the year.  Youth hunters can hunt during the regular season which is six out of 
seven days a week.  I encourage the committee to vote Ought Not to Pass on this bill.
