Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs,
On behalf of the Maine Brewers’ Guild, who represent the interests of the craft beer industry in
Maine, including brewers who brew 99.9% of all beer brewed in Maine, we would like to to offer
testimony in support of L.D. 141, with two points we wish to see clarified.
We appreciate the Bureau’s desire to simplify the rules regarding percentage of sales which
derive from food when holding a lounge license.
That said, we want to note
18-553-Chapter 102: Rule
6 of the Dept of Administrative and
Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations Rule Book
which
also has language requiring food offered by lounge licensees, and while
we
believe this law
change would abrogate the rule, we are hoping this committee can confirm or clarify this as part
of the proposed changes.
Second, we want to note that the licensing of lounges also requires municipal approvals, and
municipality timelines can vary widely, so given that the 10% of sales requirement can only be
retroactively evaluated, we wish to see some assurance that if a
licensee has a good faith belief
they would make the 10% requirement but misses the 10% requirement in a given year, they
can relicense with no gap in service.
Thank you for consideration of our testimony, and please note we would be happy to discuss
this matter further at any time.
Sincerely,
Sean M. Sullivan
Executive Director, Maine Brewers’ Guild
