LD 722 , An Act to Expedite the Health Insurance Referral Process for Specialists by Allowing Referrals 
from Urgent Care Facilities  
 
Submitted by Kimberly Cook , Esq.

As Maine’s only nonprofit CO -OP health insurance company, we are focused on provid ing affordable, 
high -quality  benefits that promote health and wellbeing.   We appreciate the  concerns raised by  Senator 
Reny and Representative Pringle in bringing this bill and their  motivation to ensure  Mainers can access 
the care they need.   We strive to  be a resource to the Committee,  and, in that vein,  we are providing 
information about how our plans operate and our perspective on this bill . 
To help our members receive the care they need, when they need it, our plans typically do not require 
that member s receive a referral for healthcare services.   We recognize the challenges some Mainers 
encounter when seeking care and are committed to removing barriers so our members receive  vital 
services.   Hence, Community Health Options makes minimal use of referrals since these referrals can be 
burdensome for  members by requiring  additional steps  or appointments  before r eceiv ing the care they 
need.  We understand that patients often encounter  the requirement  to receive a referral in order to 
make an  appointment with  specialty care provider, but for our members this is typically due to a  
provider’s internal policies.   
In addition, o ur plans feature straight forward  cost sharing arrangements that do not apply differing 
deductible s, coinsurance, or copayment s based on whether a service was referred by a member’s 
primary care provider or a different provider.  For this reason, and because our use of referrals is 
negligible, t he passage of this bill will have limited impact on our current operations  and plan structure .  
 
Thank you for considering these remarks.
