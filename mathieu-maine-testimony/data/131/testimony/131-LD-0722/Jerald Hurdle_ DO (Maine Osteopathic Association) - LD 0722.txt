Testimony of the Maine Osteopathic Association
Before the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services
In Reference to:
LD 722, An Act to Expedite the Health Insurance Referral Process for Specialists by Allowing 
Referrals from Urgent Care Facilities
Public Hearing: Tuesday, March 7, 2023 1:30 PM,Cross Building, Room 220
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and distinguished members of the Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services,
My name is Jerald Hurdle, DO. I am a board certified in Family Medicine and Proctology, with 
subspecialty training in Dermatology and I run a private practice in Oakland. I am pleased to provide 
testimony on behalf of my physician colleagues in opposition to LD 722.
The Maine Osteopathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization representing approximately 
400 osteopathic physicians as well as more than 700 residents and students. Our mission is to “serve the 
Osteopathic profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated effort of professional education, 
advocacy and member services in order to ensure the availability of quality osteopathic health care to the 
people of this State.”
We recognize that Maine’s healthcare system is strained and access to primary care is difficult in amy 
parts of the state. A very recent report published March 1, 2023 from the National Association of 
Community Health Centers found that nearly one-third of the nation do not have access to a usual source 
of primary care1. Their data showed that more than 400,000 Mainers are medically underserved. 
Therefore, we can appreciate the intent of the bill, which we believe is facilitate patients getting the care 
that they need, no matter the entry point. However, our concerns with this bill are many:
Most urgent care centers are just that – an option for those with urgent, but not immediately life-
threatening healthcare needs that for whatever reason are not being handled by primary care. Urgent care 
facilities typically are not equipped with the tools, patient background knowledge and relationship to 
make a referral appropriately. The type and extent of work up typically performed by a PCP is not 
usually performed in urgent care settings and therefore the referral process may be made prematurely.
Improper referrals from urgent care centers are not uncommon. A recent study published in the Journal 
of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open2, looking at Urgent Care Center acute referrals

2to local Emergency Rooms, found that 55% of patients referred to EDs from UCCs did not require 
ED‐specific care or resources and 64% carried a discordant diagnosis between UC and ED diagnosis 
(the patient’s emergency room diagnosis was in disagreement with that of urgent care).
As a specialist, I am concerned that an abundance of new referrals could be problematic for offices like 
mine. It is common for patients to be waiting several months to see a specialist and insufficiently 
evaluated referrals would add stress to this system, increase wait times and potentially result in more 
delays if the patient had been referred to the wrong specialty. More referrals to specialists could limit 
access to those who really need this care. Given the limited capacity of the average specialty office 
maximizing appropriate and high quality referrals would ensure patients are getting the right care and 
not overwhelming an already taxed system. 
That being said, we do recognize that for some patients, an urgent care visit is the only chance they get 
to see a healthcare provider and be referred for other necessary care. So, we have some suggestions that 
we think might improve referrals from urgent care systems:
When considering referrals, urgent care providers should communicate with the receiving specialist 
office, or medical director to determine if direct specialist referral is needed and the timeline for being 
seen, then consult with the medical director (physician) who should then make the referral. It is not 
uncommon for urgent care providers to also consult with other local Emergency Rooms and that may 
assist in determining if an acute specialist referral is needed.
It is for these reasons the MOA urges the committee to vote ought not to pass without considering 
substantial amendments.
