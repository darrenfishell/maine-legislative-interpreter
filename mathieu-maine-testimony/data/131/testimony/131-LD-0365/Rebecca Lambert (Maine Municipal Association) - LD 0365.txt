LD 365, An Act t o Support Compliance and Establish Graduated Sanctions Under the Maine 
Medical Use of Cannabis Act  
 
March 3,  2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony in support of LD 365 on 
behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and 
establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Municipal officials across Maine support any effort to enforce violations of the Maine 
Medical Use of Cannabis Act and appreciate that LD 365 seeks to develop a graduated 
enforcement plan to address violations of this law  on a proportional basis.  
The LPC further appreciates that the rulemaking process allows for stakeholder 
participation to ensure proper input and that the sanctions are fair and appropriate  to the 
violation incurred.   
Thank you for  your time and for  considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
