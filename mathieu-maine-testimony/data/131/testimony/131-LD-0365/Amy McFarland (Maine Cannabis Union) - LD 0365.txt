Good Morning, 
Ladies and Gentleman of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee. 
My name is Amy McFarland, l am the President of the Maine Cannabis Union. We stand next to 
the Lobstermen's Union, and are afﬁliated with District 4. (The International Association of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers.) 
ln addition to this, I am a patient and a cannabis famwer. 
I am here today to testify in support of LD# 365, “An Act to Support Compliance and Establish 
Graduated Sanctions Under the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act". 
When it comes to regulating our industry, we at M.C.U. believe a common sense approach is 
the best option. 
For instance, if an individual's scale is out of compliance, they should ﬁrst receive a warning, not 
a large ﬁne. Now, if a farmer has been told more than once to stop spraying a harmful pesticide 
(like Eagle 20), then a mere warning is not sufﬁcient. 
Some form of ﬁnancial penalty is just, as a patient could potentially be harmed by the farmer's 
actions. 
We at the Maine Cannabis Union would happily work with the Ofﬁce of Cannabis Policy along 
with other stakeholders on this matter. 
Thank you for your time, 
Amy McFarland 
President, Maine Cannabis Union
