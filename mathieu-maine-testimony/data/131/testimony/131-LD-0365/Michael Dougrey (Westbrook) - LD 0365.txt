LD 365
Hello,
My name is Michael and I am an owner and operator of a business in the Maine 
medical cannabis industry for several years. I want to provide written testimony in 
regard to LD 365.
First off, I am very grateful to be a part of the Maine medical cannabis program. It has
provided me a career and the ability to support my wife and young daughter. 
I fully believe that involvement and participation in the program is a privilege, and 
not a right. I think there absolutely should be punishments (fines, revocation of 
license, and perhaps legal action) for anyone willfully breaking the rules and 
regulation in the program. The severity of the sanctions should be in correlation to the
severity of the offence and should increase if further violations occur.
I'm sure many violations will be straight-forward and easy to have a clear sanction 
associated with it. However, one suggestion I have is to create a board that hears both 
sides and votes on the decision. Maybe it's an appeals board for someone who does 
not agree with the punishment? I would suggest the board include stakeholders in 
both adult use, medical, legislation, someone from OCP, and perhaps (retired lol) law 
enforcement, ordinary citizens, etc.
Thank you for taking the time to read my testimony.
Very Truly Yours,
Michael
