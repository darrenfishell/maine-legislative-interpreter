West Paris Provisions
LD 365
Senator Craig Hickman, House Chair Laura Supica and other distinguished members 
of the Joint Committee of Veterans and Legal Affairs, My name is Jennifer Morin 
(Durocher), of South Paris and I work at West Paris Provisions, a medical 
(dispensary) caregiver retail store in Oxford County. I am submitting written 
testimony for LD365, that is neither for nor against it.
I have been working for West Paris Provisions, a woman veteran owned shop, since 
it's opening in February 2021. Since we have been open, our goal has always been to 
help as many people as possible to get the medicine they need in order to maintain a 
healthy sustainable lifestyle at an affordable cost. 
About a year ago we had a state mandated inspection, and learned of a ($5) infraction 
that a (now former) employee had made. We did everything that the OCP (then OMP)
required of us, including terminating the employee. We were assured we were in full 
compliance, and continued normal business operations. Many months later my 
employer received a letter from the OCP (still OMP) suspending her Caregiver 
license, effective immediately. This was given with no warning and no definite 
suspension time.
I have heard of similar (or worse) infractions by employees at other caregiver retail 
stores, where the company was only fined by the OCP (and allowed to carry on 
business as usual), rather than having the caregiver license revoked. I am strongly 
opposed to this inconsistency, and it does need to change.
I firmly believe having a tiered and accessible disciplinary structure is a great idea. 
However because of the lack of consistency and equality with current regulations, I 
am not sure the current OCP would be the best panel to enforce it. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
