Judicial Branch testimony in favor of LD 431, An Act to Amend the Law 
Regarding Foreign Subpoenas:
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony in support of this Judicial Branch bill. 
This bill makes a small correction to the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery 
Act, specifically Title 14, section 403, regarding foreign subpoenas. Subsection 2 of the statute, 
which is not printed in the LD, provides that a clerk in a Maine court accept a subpoena from a 
court in another state or jurisdiction and, in turn, issue a Maine subpoena adopting the terms and 
information contained in the foreign subpoena.
The requirements contained in subsection 3 of the statute pertain to the Maine subpoena 
issued by the Maine clerk, rather than the original foreign subpoena, as the statute currently, 
incorrectly, states.
The revisions to section 403 made by the bill are corrections, rather than substantive 
changes.
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions.
