Statement of Ceilidh Shea 
Consumers for Affordable Health Care 
To the Joint Standing Committee On Health and Human Services 
Speaking in Support of: LD 904, An Act Supporting the Rural Health Care Workforce in Maine 
April 6, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee On Health and 
Human Services, thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments in support of LD 904, An Act 
Supporting the Rural Health Care Workforce in Maine. 
My name is Ceilidh Shea and I am a Policy Advocate at Consumers for Alfordable Health Care,a 
nonpartisan, nonproﬁt organization that advocates the right to quality, affordable health care for every 
person in Maine. CAHC is a nonpartisan, nonproﬁt organization founded in 1988 and based in Augusta 
whose mission is to advocate the right to quality, affordable health care for every person in Maine. As 
designated by Maine’s Attorney General, CAHC serves as Maine’s Health Insurance Consmner 
Assistance Program (CAP), which operates a toll-free HelpLine. Our HelpLine, ﬁelds approximately 
6,000 calls and emails every year from people across Maine who need help obtaining, keeping, using, or 
ﬁxing problems with private health insurance or with accessing or aifording health care services. CAHC 
also serves as the Ombudsman program for Maine’s Medicaid program, MaineCare, and helps people 
apply for and navigate the enrollment process for MaineCare. It is with that background that we provide 
these comments. 
Maine is considered the most rural state in the country, with forty percent of the state’s population living 
in one of Maine’s ll rural counties ‘ , which is why the establishment of this fund is of the utmost 
importance. It will foster greater retention of health care providers in rural areas of Maine through support 
of primary care workforce development. Living in rural areas is often associated with increased barriers to 
accessing care — due to lack of transportation, a need to travel farther distances to reach a primary care 
provider, or a complete lack of availability of providers. Whatever the reason may be, the overall pattern 
is clear: rural communities represent nearly two-thirds of primary care health professional shortage areas 
in the country, and this is creating enormous barriers to accessing vital healthcare. “ Maine is certainly no 
exception to this rule. In fact, only 43% of the need for a primary care provider is met in Maine?“ A2022 
Maine Shared Community Health Needs Assessment Report found that access to care was identiﬁed as the 
second highest priority in Piscataquis County, one of Maine’s most rural cormties. A lack of availability of 
primary care providers in the country was the most frequently mentioned health concern related to access 
to care. It was also identiﬁed as the largest barrier to care by community forum participants." 
In a study of Service Providers and Managers ’ Perspectives on Strengths, Gaps, and Priorities for Rural 
Health System Redesign in Washington County, Maine providers identiﬁed insufficient workforce asa 
major barrier to care for rural residents. The insufficient number of clinicians in all areas and at all levels 
was a recruring theme described by participants. A related and frequently cited challenge was the 
difﬁculty of recruiting clinicians across most areas of care. High turnover rates were identiﬁed as 
detrimental to continuity of care for patients. Participants expressed the need for more frmding to support
health professionals to stay locally, along with more training and residency opportunities." The fund 
proposed in this bill would support these opportunities and help increase availability and improve 
retention of PCPs, creating greater continuity of and proximity to care for all rural residents in Maine. 
Across the country and in Maine, rural residents are more likely to die ﬂom health issues like 
cardiovascular disease, unintentional injury, and chronic hmg disease than those living in urban areas. 
Rural residents also tend to be diagnosed with cancer at later stages and have worse outcomes." 
Increasing the number of care providers in rural areas, through the opportunities that would be funded by 
this bill, can help offset these disparities across Maine. The ability to access preventative, routine primary 
care should not depend on where someone lives in our state. Creating funds such as the one proposed in 
LD 904 is a step in the right direction — towards creating a more equitable healthcare system for all Maine 
residents, regardless of geography. It is for these reasons that I urge you to support LD 904.
