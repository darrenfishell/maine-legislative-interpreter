Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1547:
“An
Act
to
Temporarily
Prohibit
the
State
from
Mandating
COVID-19
Vaccinations”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1547.
The
wave
of
COVID-19
vaccine
mandate
policies
which
swept
the
United
States
in
2021,
whether
on
the
federal,
state,
or
local
level,
were
each
grave
injustices.
Politicians
and
so-called
public
health
experts
who
coerced
Americans
to
take
brand
new
medical
products,
one
without
long-term
data
on
safety,
or
even
efficacy
against
viral
transmission,
betrayed
the
public
trust.
These
decisions
will
go
down
in
history
as
some
of
the
most
ignorant
and
destructive
domestic
policies
in
decades.
LD
1547
would
impose
a
five-year
moratorium
on
any
COVID-19
vaccine
mandate
in
Maine.
It
is
an
emergency
bill
because
the
situation
precipitated
by
the
governor's
mandates
is
dire
after
thousands
of
nurses,
aides,
and
other
administrative,
non-patient-facing
workers
were
either
coerced
to
a
product
they
previously
refused,
or
fired,
in
fall
2021.
1
Other
mandates
that
flowed
from
it,
like
those
on
students
of
Maine’s
university
and
community
college
systems,
forced
20-year-olds
to
receive
a
vaccine
for
a
disease
which
posed
virtually
no
threat
to
their
health.
In
fact,
for
young
men
and
boys,
receiving
this
vaccine
may
well
be
more
dangerous
than
the
virus
itself.
A
presentation
to
VRBPAC
by
Dr.
Hong
Yang,
Senior
Advisor
for
Risk-Benefit
Assessment
at
the
FDA’s
Office
of
Biostatistics
and
Epidemiology,
during
the
October
26
meeting
showed
considerable
risks
to
young
boys,
even
from
the
smaller-dose
childhood
injection.

Shown
in
the
graph
above,
Dr.
Yang’s
model
predicted
that
vaccinating
males
aged
5
to
11
would
prevent
67
ICU
stays
and
203
hospitalizations
for
COVID-19
per
one
million
boys,
but
would
also
result
in
57
ICU
visits
and
156
hospital
stays
for
vaccine-induced
myocarditis.
This
risk-benefit
analysis
only
considered
myocarditis
and
heart-related
risks
post-vaccination.
2
The
low
COVID-transmission
scenario
clearly
showed
no
benefit
in
terms
of
hospitalizations.
Shouldn’t
the
benefits
of
vaccination
clearly
outweigh
the
risks
in
every
scenario?
The
governor
is
unwilling
to
admit
the
truth:
that
her
mandate
did
nothing
to
affect
COVID-19
transmission.
It
only
weakened
the
state’s
healthcare
system
in
a
time
of
crisis.
This
bill
should
be
a
critical
priority
for
this
Legislature.
Please
deem
LD
1547
“Ought
To
Pass.”
It
is
the
least
that
this
Legislature
or
the
state
government
can
do
to
ensure
that
some
of
the
injustices
of
the
last
few
years
never
happen
again.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
