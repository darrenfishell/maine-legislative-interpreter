TESTIMONY NEITHER FO R NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 1547  
 
AN ACT TO TEMPORARIL Y PROHIBIT THE STATE  FROM  
MANDATING COVID -19 V ACCINATIONS  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Committee on Health 
and Human Services. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine School 
Boards Association, submitting testimony on behalf of the legislative committee of 
the Maine School Boards Association, neither for nor against L.D. 1547.  
 
This bill would require a five -year waiting period before a vaccine for COVID -19 
approved by the US Department of Health and Services can be mandated for use. 
School Boards are neither for nor against this bill.  
 
While this bill doesn ’t directly affect schools, our position recognizes the manda-
tory vaccination rule for health care workers ordered by the governor helped pro-
tect our students and teachers whose family members worked in health care facili-
ties. It also helped protect members of the community where those health care 
workers live and shop.  
 
Those workers were the heroes of this pandemic, many of whom chose to isolate 
themselves when going home after work. The mandatory vaccine was a further 
protection.  
 
Should C OVID -19 reappear to a level where the need for C OVID -19 vaccinations 
and booster shots would be in the best interest of public and school health, waiting 
years may not be the most prudent thing to do and to have this waiting period leg-
islated could prevent the typical operation of our public schools.
