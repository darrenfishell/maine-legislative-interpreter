Pamela Vose
Union
LD 1547
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident of Union, Maine.
I am writing in opposition to LD 1547.   
The State of Maine public health officials must be able to do their job without 
interference from politicians trying to score political points.   The health of all of our 
citizens is not up for discussion.
I urge to to vote Ought Not to Pass on this political and misguided bill.
