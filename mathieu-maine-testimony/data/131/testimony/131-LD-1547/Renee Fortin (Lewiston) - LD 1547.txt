LD 1547
Dear Members of the HHS Committee,  
I am urging ought to pass on ~ LD 1547: "An Act to Temporarily Prohibit the State 
from Mandating COVID-19 Vaccinations" (Emergency)
Here is what this Act would do ~ SUMMARY
This bill prohibits mandatory vaccinations for COVID-19 for 5 years from the date of 
a vaccine's first emergency use authorization by the United States Department of 
Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration in order to allow for 
safety testing and investigations into reproductive harm.
Isn't safety for the people what we all desire? Haven't we all seen enough destruction?
Stand up to save lives, and please vote "ought to pass" on LD 1547
