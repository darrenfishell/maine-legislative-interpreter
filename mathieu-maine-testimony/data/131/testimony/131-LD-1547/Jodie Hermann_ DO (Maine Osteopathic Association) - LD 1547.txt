Senator  Baldacci , Representative  Meyer  and distingu ished members of the Committee on  Health & 
Human Services , 
 
My name is  Jodie Hermann, D O, FACOI, FACP, MBA. I am board certified in Internal Medicine an d 
Neurom uscular Manual Medicine  and I practice inter nal medicine and Osteopathic Manipulative 
Medicine at area  hospitals , such as Maine M edical Center .  I am please d to provi de testimon y on behalf 
of the Maine Osteopathic Association  in opposition to the bills listed a bove .  
 
The Maine Osteo pathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization representing approximately 
400 osteopathic physicians as well as more than 700 res idents and stu dents. Our missio n is to “ serve the 
Osteopathic profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated e ffort of professional education, 
advocacy and member services in order to ensure the availability of quality osteopathic health care to th e 
people of th is State.”  
 
These six bills would undermine our progress in protecting public health. They sow doubt in our public 
health s ystem, science, modern medicine, and the professionals that we rely upon to keep our 
communities safe. Many are based o n misinformation about vaccine safety and effectiveness.  
 
The MO A is a strong supporter of  immunizations , which are an important public health too l with 
twofold utili ty—protecting those who are vaccinated and those they encou nter from the spread of 
disease . We , along with the rest of Maine ’s physician community,  were vocal in our supp ort of  
Governor Mills ’ 2021 Emergency Rule Requiring Health Care Workers in Maine to Be Fully 
Vaccinated Against COVID -19.  
 
In our formal statement MOA  President Brian Kaufman , DO  stated : "Osteopathic medicine has a long 
and proud history of utilizing the bodies innate healing mechanisms to combat illness and promote 
health. The appropriate application of vaccinations has transformed the face of healthcare and in  the 
truest ost eopathic tradition has advanced preventative care.  

 2  
The ongoing pandemic has given rise to another vaccine which despite its rapid development and 
deployment has been shown to be highly effective and safe. Given the ongoing efforts in preven tion and 
treatm ent of infection by COVID -19, the medical science firmly supports vaccination in those who do 
not have a medical contraindication.  
 
Our patients deserve whatever protection we can offer and for this reason the Maine osteopathic 
association i s in favor of m andatory vaccination of workers in healthcare to ensure patient safety and 
hasten the decline of the pandemic."  
 
The tenets of this statement remain applicable to th ese pieces of legislation  in front of you today.  We 
remain committed to all healthcare work ers (including EMS) adhering to vaccine requirements  as 
deemed appropr iate by our healthcare agen cies (D HHS, CDC).  And we believe we must trust in these 
agencies to determine the necess ity of these a nd other future immunizations moving forward.   
 
As physic ians, w e must utilize the  best medical decision making  and treatment tools at ha nd to provide 
the best possible patient care and outcomes. We must acc ept that the  “best” practices and tools evolve  
and we mu st be prepared to evolve with them.  
 
Our current vaccine policies allow us to live, work, and play safe from disease  and for appropriate 
agencies to change these policies as appropriate , weighing new scientific  knowledge and public health 
risks as they arise.  When we know better, we must do better to prot ect ourselves and others from the 
spread of disease.  
 
It is for these reasons  the MOA urges the committee t o vote ought not to pass on LD 172, LD 601, LD 
1547, and LD 1598 .
