Dear Honorable Members of the Joint Committee on Health and Human Service,   
I am an experienced Public Health RN from Brewer, ME. I have been employed at the
Bangor Immunization and Travel Clinic for over 7 years. Prior to that I worked for 
over 35 years in hospitals with new families and newborns, Emergency nursing and 
ICU. I am opposed to the proposed legislation - LD59, LD172, LD601, LD1382, 
LD1587 and LD1598. 
The Maine Immunization Program, including the Maine Universal Childhood 
Immunization Program provides safe and effective vaccines protecting Maine families
from many infectious and potentially deadly diseases, including COVID19. I hope the
COVID19 vaccine remains available through the MIP.
It is especially concerning that some of these bills propose exemptions and removal of
vaccination requirements for healthcare workers and EMS personnel. Immunizations 
help protect these workers as well as the medically vulnerable patients they care for. 
Established public health requirements in our state save lives using science and 
modern medicine. 
It is sad and disturbing to me that a very few health care providers and others are 
attempting to undermine our public health system in Maine based on vaccine 
misinformation.
I ask the Joint Committee to vote "ought not to pass" on all the bills under 
consideration to maintain Maine's strong and effective public health system.
Thank you for your time and care for the health of all the people in Maine.
