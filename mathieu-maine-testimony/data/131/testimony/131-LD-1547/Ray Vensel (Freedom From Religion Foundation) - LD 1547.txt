Members of the Health and Human Services Committee, this is testimony AGAINST LD 1547.  
The AMA, CDC, and NIH have all stated that the COVID vaccine has been studied and tested 
for any effects on fertility. They have found no such negative effects, and have published many 
reports indicating so. The vaccines have been developed with extraordinary speed not by 
ignoring safety, but by using new technologies and techniques. This bill seems to be a reaction to 
fear and even misinformation and would eliminate an effective tool for the protection of public 
health.  
Please protect public health, and donâ€™t let this bill pass. Thank you.
