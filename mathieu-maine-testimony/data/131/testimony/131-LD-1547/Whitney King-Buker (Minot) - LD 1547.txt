As a former healthcare worker I have seen far too much with patients to justify 
mandating Covid 19 vaccinations for our State's citizens young to old. 
Initial booster side effects followed by long-term suffering, death. 
As a former immuno scientist I have not seen long-term validation testing that would 
justify validity of safety with any of such injections.
More time and focus should be taken on testing and processing for such materials 
upstream for future safe accessibility for those with suppressed immune systems.
