In opposition to LD1476 An Act to Amend the Definition of “Metallic Mineral” in 
the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and the Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources my name is Arleigh Kraus I am a registered cannabis caregiver 
with a B.S. in biochemistry, an organic farmer, and business owner in Warren. I am a 
board member of Maine based Citizens against Residential Mining Activities 
(CARMA) and a concerned citizen scientist. 
I am presenting testimony today in opposition to LD 1476.
The elimination of lithium containing spodumene from regulatory oversight is 
negligent.  Removal of regulations governing mining and mineral extraction is not a 
responsible or acceptable practice.  
I urge the committee to vote ought not to pass.
Respectfully, 
Arleigh A. Kraus
