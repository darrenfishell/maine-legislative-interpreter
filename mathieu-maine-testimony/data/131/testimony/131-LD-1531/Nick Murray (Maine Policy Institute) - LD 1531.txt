Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1531:
“Resolve,
to
Implement
a
4-year
Moratorium
on
Solar
Energy
Subsidies
and
Direct
the
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
to
Study
the
Economic
Impact
of
Industrial
Solar
Energy
Projects”
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities
and
Technology,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1531.
This
bill
is
urgently
necessary,
especially
in
the
wake
of
a
recent
Bangor
Daily
News
article
exposing
how
much
Maine
ratepayers
are
being
hosed
by
the
governor’s
“community
solar”
incentives.
OPA
estimates
that,
if
all
750
community
solar
farms
under
development
are
completed
in
the
next
year
or
two,
Maine
ratepayers
will
be
on
the
hook
for
more
than
$270
million,
or
$330
per
year
for
the
average
customer
of
CMP
or
Versant.
This
is
on
top
of
staggering,
historic
yearly
rises
in
Mainers’
electricity
prices,
two
years
in
a
row.
We
share
a
grid
with
the
rest
of
New
England
(ISO-NE),
and
our
region
pays
the
highest
for
electricity
(all
sectors)
in
the
nation,
outside
of
California.
While
the
national
monthly
average
price
for
power
in
2022
was
12.4
cents
per
kilowatt-hour,
that
figure
in
New
England
is
20.6
cents/kWh,
66%
more
expensive.
This
is
unsustainable.
It
is
often
claimed
that
our
region’s
expensive
electricity
is
a
result
of
the
winter
cold
climate,
but
this
is
not
the
case
considering
that
other
high-latitude
states
across

the
midwest
and
plains
contend
with
an
average
all-sector
price
of
electricity
45%
cheaper
than
the
New
England
average
price.
The
fact
is,
our
policies
incentivizing
inefficient
energy
generation
sources—like
solar
power—are
to
blame
for
our
region’s
crippling
energy
costs.
Even
Phil
Bartlett,
PUC
chair
and
former
Maine
Democratic
Party
operative
noted
that
community
solar
“a
regressive
way
of
funding
public
policy.”
1
Opponents
of
net
metering
warned
of
this
reality.
Now
that
it
has
come
to
pass,
will
we
learn
from
our
mistakes?
To
stabilize
this
issue,
this
legislature
should
pass
LD
1531
and
install
an
immediate
moratorium
on
all
types
of
solar
subsidies.
Mainers
should
have
an
opportunity
to
objectively
assess
the
costs,
after
a
previous
legislature
jumped
feet-first
into
this
misguided
policy,
and
decide
whether
continuing
on
the
same
path
is
prudent.
Please
deem
LD
1531
“Ought
To
Pass”
to
provide
relief
to
ratepayers,
and
provide
time
to
determine
the
efficacy
of
community
solar
programs
and
other
giveaways
to
inefficient
“green
energy”
technologies.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
