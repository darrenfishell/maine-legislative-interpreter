LD1531 
Ld1531 is very timely if you pay attention to 
what is going on around the world you will find 
that countries are going to nuclear energy. I 
have always thought that solar and wind were 
not the right fit. Just take a look at the amount 
of land that solar takes and in 20 years the  
panels will all have to be replaced and  they are 
not  recyclable so what are we going to do with 
them bury them.? Wind mills in the ocean are 
creating havoc with the whales all along the 
east coast. I believe there have been 24 whales 
on the land from the windmills. If this  was such 
a great idea there would not be a need for my 
taxdollars. I this was such a great idea investors 
would spend their own money. The current 
amount of co2 in the atmosphere is .004% at 
.002 % the plants start to dye. So at what level 
do you think we should go. We need co2 in the 
atmosphere. As government spends more of 
our hard earned money on this a certain 
number of countries are making money and it’ 
isn’t us and Im sure you know which countries 
are getting MY dollars. It’s  time to put the 
brakes on this  foolish spending I support the 
moritoriam on this. Please vote ought  to pass
