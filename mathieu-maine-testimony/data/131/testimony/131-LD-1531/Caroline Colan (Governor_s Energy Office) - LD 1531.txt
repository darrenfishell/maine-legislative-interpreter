TESTIMONY BEFORE THE ENERGY, UTILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE 
Resolve, to Implement a 4-year Moratorium on Solar Energy 
Subsidies and Direct the Department of Environmental Protection 
to Study the Economic Impact of Industrial Solar Energy Projects 
L.D. 1531 
GOVERNOR'S ENERGY OFFICE 
April 18, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology (EUT): My name is Caroline Colan, and I am the Legislative Liaison for the 
Governor's Energy Office (GEO). 
The GEO testifies in opposition to L.D. 1531. 
Maine has seen robust growth in solar photovoltaic (PV) installation since 2019, with generally 
consistent growth in small-scale, typically behind-the-meter installations, including on rooftops; a 
number of community-scale distributed projects; and growth in larger utility-scale solar installations. 
This growth is attributable to multiple factors, including continued cost decreases driven by efficiencies 
of scale and industry maturity, effective policy supporting the development of clean energy, and 
increasing consumer awareness and demand for clean energy. These projects produce clean, renewable 
energy and provide valuable benefits to customers and to the electrical grid. To achieve Maine's 
decarbonization goals, it will require significant acceleration of clean energy deployment. 
Maine's solar industry supported nearly 700 jobs in 2021.1 Solar installers in Maine experienced the 
second largest percentage increase in employment between 2015 and 2021, growing by 60 percent. This 
is followed by electricians which experienced 22.5% growth during the same period — these jobs are also 
critical to supporting the installation of clean energy projects in the state. Over the next decade, the 
state's environmental and clean energy statutory requirements and goals will create continued demand 
for clean energy jobs. A recent report released by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 
highlights the projected employment growth over the next decade across key technology sectors in 
Maine, including solar, wind, battery, and energy efficiency. Maine's overall Economic Development 
Strategy workforce goals include to attract 75,000 workers and increase wages by 10 percent, and 
Governor Mills has announced a clean energy-specific goal to create 30,000 clean energyjobs by 2030.2

Setting aside the clear benefits that solar provides to our electric grid and to a strong clean energy 
economy in Maine, the GEO would like to note that the objectives of this legislation are unclear, except 
to stifle the continued development of this industry in the state. 
The language in Section 1 regarding a moratorium on solar energy subsidies is unclear in scope and 
could bar not only use of the state's net energy billing programs, but other programs that assist Maine 
communities in reducing carbon emissions, transitioning to clean energy, and becoming more resilient 
to climate change like the state's Community Resilience Partnership. lt could also potentially impact the 
ability of the state to pass through federal dollars from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation 
Reduction Act to communities around the state, disadvantaging Maine at a time when historic federal 
funding is available. 
Regarding Section 2, it is unclear what is meant by "industrial solar.” The majority of solar projects in 
Maine and New England are behind-the-meter projects at residences and those connected to the local 
electricity distribution system, rather than to the regional transmission system?’ For additional 
information on the economic and jobs benefits of clean energy in Maine, including solar, we recommend 
reviewing the GEO's 2022 Maine Clean Energy Workforce Analysis Report.‘ 
Thank you for your consideration.
