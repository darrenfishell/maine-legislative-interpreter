Senator l,a\\‘rence, Representat.i\'e /eigler and distinguished members of the _|oint Standing 
(iommittee on l§nei'g§ ‘ , lltilities, and 'l‘ 
eclm<>l<> _<,{\' 
Xiy name is \‘(7illiam i'lfl1'\Y()()Ll and l am here today, as Public ;\d\'ocate, to testify in 
opposition to Ll) 1531, “Resolve, to Implement a ~i—§‘L‘111‘ Moratorium on Solar llnergy $ubsidies and 
Direct the Department of i{n\'ironmental Protection to Study the llconomic impact of lndustrial 
Solar liiiergy Projects. ” 
.\ four—\‘ear moratorium on solar subsidies is likelv to undermine all our collective \\'orl\' to 
reduce our dependence on natural gas and achieve our climate goals. Rather than a moratorium on 
subsidies, the ()l);\ urges the (iommittee to take a close look at both our Net linergy Billing 
pi'o _<,;ran'i and our competitive bidding pro _t;i"am and make necessary adjustments to each that will 
result in consumers receiving the most solar at the lowest possible ratepayer subsidy. The ()l’_\ 
looks ti'>nva1 ‘ci to working with the Committee to reduce the scope of the Xlili program and expand 
the role of competitive bidding to continue expanding the role oi‘ solar in meeting our growing need 
for more electricity. 
Thank you For your time, attention_ and consideration of this testimony. The Office of the 
Public ;\d\'ocate looks i0l'\\'2li ‘Li to \V()1‘l§lI1 _<,_§ with the Committee on l.l) 1531 and \\'ill be available for 
the work session to assist the Committee in its consideration of this bill.
