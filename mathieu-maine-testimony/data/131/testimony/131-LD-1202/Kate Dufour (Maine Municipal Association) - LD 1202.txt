In Support of  
LD 1202, An Act to Increase the Homestead Exemption to $50,000  
 
April 5, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee .  My 
name is Kate Dufour  and I am offering testimony in support of LD 1202 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of mu nicipal interest.   
 The proposal found in LD 1202 that seeks to increase the homestead exemption from 
$25,000 to $50,000 and increase and cap state reimbursement for 85% of lost property tax 
revenue, is considered by municipal officials a worthwhile alter native to the implementation of 
the property tax stabilization law  enacted in 2022.  Not only will the bill provide much needed 
tax relief for all homeowners, but  as opposed to the stabilization program, it is also  far less 
administratively burdensome for municipal assessors  to implement .   
 However, t he level of reimbursement for lost property tax revenues envisioned in the bill 
and greatly appreciated by municipal officials, w ill have an  impa ct on state coffers .   
It is for this reason that  municipal leaders ask that the committee consider  an in crease in 
the homestead exemption as it continu es to discuss  how best to deliver property tax relief to all 
Maine residents .   
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this bill.  If you have questions 
about the Association’s position, please do not hesitate to contact me at 1 -800-452-8786 or
