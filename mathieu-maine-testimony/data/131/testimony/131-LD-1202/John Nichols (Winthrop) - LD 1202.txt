An Act to Eliminate Senior Citizen Property Tax Stabilization and Expand the 
Homestead Property Tax Exemption
To The Members of the Taxation Committee
I have seen testimony on this issue mostly from administrators and bureaucrats, none 
from citizens or constituents. I wonder if I am the only citizen that knows about this. I
feel you need to hear and see numbers that show how an ordinary person would be 
affected. The only notice I have seen was a jarring and possibly inaccurate account in 
the Kennebec Journal.
Without the Stabilization legislation and even with as much as a$75,000 exemption, I 
could be left high and dry with at least a doubling of my current property tax. I am 
probably a good example of why the Stabilization program was proposed in the first 
place.
I am an 84-year-old retired state employee and military veteran who has lived in 
Winthrop Maine since 1975 when I left active duty in the US Air Force. In 1986/87 
while employed at MDOT I made a big plunge to purchase and build a home on a 
Lake Maranacook waterfront lot. I was not wealthy then and I am not now. The 
property cost $67,000 and new home construction was $90,000. The builder was very 
kind to wait for me to obtain a mortgage before receiving final payment. When I 
retired in 2000 the valuation was $187,100. In 2007 it was raised to $334,200. And 
my tax with homestead and military exemptions was $3,940. In tax year 20/21 my tax
had escalated to $6261.08 and by virtue of some tax code miracle my exemptions 
were lowered and my tax increased to $6641.16. 
I am in the middle of a series of neighborhood sales to out-of-staters in a range of 
$600,000-$800,000. My water frontage is more desirable than any of those recent 
sales, my placement near the water could never be done again under current codes. 
The home is modest, but I fear and suspect a new evaluation, which may happen 
soon, would try to evaluate my property to match some of those sales. I think that 
works out to about $12,000 to $16,000 in taxes. A $75,000 exemption would be a 
drop in the bucket all the way down to somewhere around $10,500 to $14,000 in 
taxes. That is still about double. My state retirement this year increased by a little over
1%.
I believe that the biggest complaint about the current law is the rare possibility of 
someone winning the lottery, moving into a mansion somewhere and being taxed at 
the same rate as they paid for their small 2-BR cape on a half-acre lot. That could be 
changed.
I hope there are enough competent minds in the legislature to rewrite the current law 
to  limit the benefit to the residence and owner named in the original request and 
approval. If you move, you take your chances.
Thank You,
John Nichols
