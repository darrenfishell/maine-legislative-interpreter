Testimony  
In Support  
LD 1202: An Act to Increase the Homestead Exemption to $50,000  
John Kosinski, Government Relations Director, Maine Education Association  
Before the Taxation Committee  
April  6, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and esteemed members of the Taxation Committee,  
My name is John Kosinski (he/him) and I am proud to serve as the Director of Government Relations for 
the Maine Education Association (MEA).  The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, 
including teachers and other professionals in nearly ev ery public school in the state and faculty and other 
professional staff in the University of Maine and Community College Systems.  
 
I submit this testimony on behalf of the MEA in support of LD 1202, An Act to Increase the Homestead 
Exemption to $50,000.  
 
As I have testified before this Committee, the MEA is consistently concerned about the reliance on 
property taxes to fund local publ ic schools, and we support efforts to provide targeted relief to property 
tax payers.  It took nearly two decades for the state to finally meet its obligation to public schools by 
funding 55% of the cost of public education, and we are deeply grateful for the continued bipartisan 
support of 55% state funding for schools.  But the years the state underfunded public schools pushed 
more of the responsibility to fund schools onto local towns via property taxes.  
 
It is important to note, the state’s funding for mula is an adequacy model to fund public education.  The 
formula is called the Essential  Programs and Services formula, and it is designed to provide what the 
state deems as “essential.”  Programs above what is deemed “essential” are a local responsibility .  For 
example, school athletics, field trips, additional student supports all may be above what the state deems 
essential, and therefore become paid for through local property taxes.   
 
One of the main findings from an exhaustive study of our state’s scho ol funding formula underscored the 
need to augment the Homestead Exemption and the Property Tax Fairness Credit.  Both are designed to 
provide targeted relief.  In addition, the Homestead Exemption also allow communities to collect more 
property tax payers  from second homes.  This is especially important in certain “minimum receiver 
towns” – these are towns that have high property values, often due in large part to valuable coastal or 
lakeside real estate and therefore receive very little state aid for scho ols.  These towns rely almost 
entirely on local property tax payers.  Augmenting the Homestead Exemption as called for in LD 1202 
will allow these communities to raise local property taxes while minimizing impact on year -round 
residents.

We believe i ncreasing the Homestead Exemption helps to balance out the reliance we place in Maine on 
local property tax payers to fund public schools.  In addition, augmenting the Homestead Exemption is 
progressive.  The impact on a property worth $200,000 will be qui te different than a property worth 
millions.   
 
For these reasons, we support LD 1202.  Thank you for your consideration and for your service to the 
people of Maine and I will do my best to answer any questions you may have.
