RE: Testimony in Support of LD 1324, An Act to Allow Credit and Debit Card Surcharges; and 
LD 1262, An Act to Amend the Law Governing the Credit Card and Debit Card Surcharge 
Prohibition - 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage Insurance and 
Financial Services Committee: 
My name is Curtis Picard and lam the President and CEO of the Retail Association of Maine.l 
am a resident of Topsham. We have more than 350 members statewide and represent retailers 
of all sizes. I am here to testify in support of both LD 1324 and LD 1262. 
We appreciate both Senator Guerin and Representative Woodsome submitting these 
proposals. Senator Guerin reached out to us last summer or fall about this issue, and we helped 
give her the history and background. I am presuming that Representative Woodsome has heard 
similar feedback from businesses about Maine's wonky and unfair regulation. Both of these bills 
offer ways to address the issue, although LD 1324 may be the cleanest if the committee decides 
to move forward. . 
Actor Samuel L. Jackson is often asking television viewers, "What's in your wal|et?" Even my 
own bank sent me an email to use my debit card "the next time you're picking up a cup of 
coffee, grabbing a snack, or buying a new book, remember, no purchase is too small.” During 
the pandemic, consumers were advised to avoid cash and use contactless payments by credit 
and debit cards. Consumers are constantly urged to use reward credit and debit cards. The 
more you use it, the more rewards you get. The rewards aren't free, of course. They are paid 
for by retailers and merchants who accept credit and debit cards and that cost averages around 
3% of each transaction.
The intent of LD 1324 is to repeal a confusing and unfair law in Maine statutes. The last time we 
had this discussion in 2018, we ultimately agreed to better clarifying language from the Bureau 
of Consumer Credit Protection and the Bureau of Financial institutions that would allowa 
business to advertise a "cash price” and a ”credit price" side by side. l am attaching that 
clarifying letter to my testimony. To this day, businesses are still confused how it gets applied. 
The current statute reads: 
Title 9-A MRS §8-509. Credit card and debit card surcharge prohibition 
1. Surcharge prohibited. A seller in a sales transaction may not impose a surcharge ona 
cardholder who elects to use a credit card or debit card in lieu of payment by cash, check or 
similar means. For purposes of this section, "surcharge" means any means of increasing the 
regular price to a cardholder that is not imposed on a customer paying by cash, check or similar 
means. A discount or reduction from the regular price is not a surcharge. 
2. Surcharge permitted for governmental entity. Notwithstanding subsection 1,a 
governmental entity may impose a surcharge for payments made with a credit card or debit 
card for taxes, fines, charges, utility fees, regulatory fees, registration fees, license or permit 
fees or the provision of a specific service or good provided by that governmental entity if the 
surcharge: 
A. ls disclosed clearly to the consumer prior to payment; and 
B. Does not exceed the costs associated with providing the credit card or debit card service that 
are directly incurred by the governmental entity or assessed by an authorized 3rd-party 
payment service provider for a credit card or debit card transaction. If there is not a cost 
assessed by an authorized 3rd-party payment service provider for a debit card transaction, the 
governmental entity may not impose a surcharge associated with a debit card transaction. 
A governmental entity shall disclose to the consumer that the surcharge may be avoided if the 
consumer makes payments by cash, check or other means not a credit card or debit card.A 
governmental entity is not subject to any liability to the issuer of a credit card or an authorized 
3rd-party payment service provider for nonpayment of credit card charges by the consumer. As 
used in this subsection, "governmenta/ entity” includes, but is not limited to, a state department 
or agency, a county established or governed by Title 30-A, Part 1, a municipality as defined 
in Title 30-A, section 2001, subsection 8, a plantation established or governed by Title 30-A, 
chapter 301, a quasi-municipal corporation as defined in Title 30-A, section 2604, subsection 5’, 
the Judicial Department as described in I_i_tl_eii, the University of Maine System, the Maine 
Community College System and the Maine Maritime Academy.
l think the aspect of this law that truly angers our members is the specific exemption given to 
municipalities and universities. lf l pay for my property taxes with my airline mileage card, my 
town can charge me a surcharge to pay for the cost of accepting the card. If a wealthy 
individual pays for her child's university tuition with a rewards card, the university can chargea 
surcharge. Yet, retailers are prevented from having this choice. We have no issue with these 
exemptions. Simply, the same benefit should be extended to businesses who choose to do it, 
and consumers can choose to patronize that business or not. 
We continue to field multiple calls a year regarding this law, and Maine is one of the few states 
to have this law on the books, and other states have continued to repeal the prohibition. The 
opponents to this bill are going to get up and say retailers are just going to start charging a 
surcharge on every transaction. First, if you have traveled around the country, you know that is 
not the case. This is about giving retailers freedom of speech when they try to give their 
customers a break for paying by cash. lt is about giving the merchant the choice to advertise 
and price their products the way that meets their needs and to be able to show customers the 
cost of using a credit or debit card without running afoul of the law. 
We thank the committee for the consideration of these bills, and urge your support. 
Sincerely, 
Curtis Picard, CAE, 
President and CEO

Re: Further guidance, re: hnplcmenta ﬁon of9-A MRS? §s-509(1), “Credit Card am; Debi; Card 
Surcharge Prohibition ” 
Dear Se11‘ato1'-~ Whittcmorc, Representative Law';'<;>nce_a;1d Mombers of the Committee: 
You have requested fuﬂher clariﬁcation with respect ‘to our agencies ’ Joint Advisory Ruling 
#119; issued Iuly 12, 2011, in which wc stated thax itjs permissible for -a morchonf to offoij 
-discounts from tho z_:egu"Iar pfioo to -ccnémneré who use payment methods other than creﬁit or 
debit cards.- 
In discussion ﬁwith the committee, two speciﬁc questions emerged, and. we answer them below 
Question 1.4 May a retailer post both the “reg'u1ar ” 1m-discounted price that’s available to 
consumers using credit otdebié cards, as well as ﬁhe discounted “cas_h’~’ price for those who use 
other payment methods?' 
Answer: Yes, a retailer can post both the regular price and the discounted cash price. Ifa 
merchant opfs to discloso both prices; then the regular price must be as prominent as, or 
more prominent than,--the discountod cash price, and the diécotulttzd prioe~sh0t11cI beA 
labeled as a “Cash” or “Cash Discount ” price. A merchant may also choose to express 
the cash discount as a percentage, either on the label or on "a display at the point of sale 
or other prominent location.
