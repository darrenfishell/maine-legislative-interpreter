Effected retirement 
William Plourde 
My name is William Plourde and I currently am employed by 
the Maine State Police and have been for the past 21 years.I 
am here today representing myself and not the Maine State 
Police. 
In 4 years, I will be retiring at the age of 59 and will have served 
the citizens of the State of Maine for a total of 36 years through 
several law enforcement agencies and in 3 separate retirement 
plans. I recently learned of a rule which will reduce one of my 
Maine State Retirement plans for my 3.63 years that I invested 
while working at the Maine State Prison by 7.26% because I will 
be retiring 2 years prior to the age of 62. 
When I was hired by the Maine State Police I was advised thatI 
would receive an extra 2% for every year I had in my other state 
retirement plans, to include my time at the Maine State Prison. 
I had spoken to MEPERS several times over the years and there 
was never any mention of a penalty for retiring prior to the age 
of 62 on my plan through the prison. I just recently learned that 
there is a 6% penalty for retiring prior to the age of 62 and 
-which will decrease my 3.63 years of State Prison time by 
7.26%.
Once I retire in 4 years, I don't believe that after serving the 
citizens of Maine for a total of 36 years that being penalized is 
fair to myself or other effected by this rule. 
Maine State Prison — 1991-1995-25/55 plan at 50% pay-3.63 
years total (Facing reduction of 7.26%) 
Richmond PD — 1995-1997 (Not ME State Retirement) 
Gardiner Police Department - 1997-2002-25 and 2/3rds pay 
4.29 years total (No effected percent and at % at Gardiner rate) 
ME SP —- 2002 to present 25 years/no age for 50% pay of 
average highest 3 years 
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
