Testimony of Jeff McCa be 
Maine Service Employees Association, SEIU Local 1989 
In Support of LD 106, "An Act to Standardize Service Credit Qualifications for State Retirees" 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
Thursday, February 9, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and 
Housing, I'm Jeff McCabe, director of politics and legislation for the Maine Service Employees 
Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union. We are a labor union representing 
over 13,000 Maine workers, including workers and retirees for all three branches of Maine State 
Government. 
First, on behalf of all the members of MSEA-SEIU Local 1989, we thank you for the work you are doing. 
It's so important to fund the quality services Maine people count on and to ensure that the workers who 
deliver those services, both those currently working and those who have retired after dedicating their 
careers in service to all Maine people, are respected, protected and paid fairly for their work. Your work 
on this committee is central to making that happen. 
I am here today to support LD 106. While we support the concept of the bill, we feel the language 
proposed needs some edits and suggestions from the Maine Public Employees Retirement System 
(MainePERS), which may be able to help with language or explain what current practice is. We 
understand that not all situations are the same and legislating specific situations is challenging. We have 
spoken to the sponsor of the bill and understand his attentions to try to make the system work better 
for participants and we support that goal. 
Long term, we want to see lasting solutions for workers that may be working for state government and 
then working in municipal government or vice versa. 
I look forward to working with you on this bill, and I will answer any questions and happy to provide 
information for the work session.
