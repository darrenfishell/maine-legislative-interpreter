In Opposition to 
LD 1496 - An Act to Prohibit Noncompete Clauses 
April 19, 2023 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Labor Committee, my name is Jeffrey 
Austin and this testimony is offered in opposition to LD 1496 on behalf of the Maine Hospital 
Association.  The Maine Hospital Association (MHA) represents all 36 community-governed 
hospitals including 33 non-profit general acute care hospitals, 2 private psychiatric hospitals, and 
1 acute rehabilitation hospital.   
Hospitals are all over the map on the use of these clauses.  Some use them; some don’t; some don’t 
now but may again if the economy shifts.  Hospitals generally only use them with physicians. 
The bill as drafted includes some exceptions, but none would apply to hospitals. 
The existing law, both case law and statute, is quite restrictive.  We would appreciate it if the 
existing exception that is being stricken in line 21 for situations where the employer seeks to 
protect its goodwill were left in the law. 
The fact pattern of concern to us is that a physician, with no existing practice and no existing 
patient customer base takes a position with a hospital and is provided with patients who come to 
the hospital for care.  The patients are attracted to the hospital because of the hospital’s reputation.   
If that physician then leaves – and if the patients follow and also leave the hospital practice – the 
goodwill that was used to attract those patients to the hospital in the first place is lost. 
Finally, this law was just substantially changed two years ago and the federal government is 
looking at it now.  There is no pressing need to adopt this legislation at this time. 
Thank you for accepting our testimony.
