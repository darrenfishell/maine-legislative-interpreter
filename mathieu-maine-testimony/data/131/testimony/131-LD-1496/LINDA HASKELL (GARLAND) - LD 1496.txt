LD 1496 - An Act to Prohibit Noncompete Clauses HP951 LINDA HASKELL, 
GARLAND, MAINE TESTIMONY in opposition to LD1496
Mr. Speaker, Senators and Representatives; This Act would destroy any business that 
is operating to prosper and support the economy that runs this State of Maine. I can 
only imagine the individuals proposing this Act do not have any business background 
or working expertise in commerce and trade, and probably have never owned and 
operated a successful entity/business which has or does employee workers. The Laws,
that would be scrutinized by this Act, have been put in place to protect the proper 
operations of business and organized firms. Which supports the development of a 
more equitable productive work environment for the State of Maine. The original 
Laws and Acts which have supported the community for Commerce have survived 
due to the fair trade and commerce, We the People can not let groups with self 
involved financial greed,  let our system be violated or allow legislators be lobbied to 
accommodate such underhanded legislation. The original Act for Noncomplete 
Clauses was to protect the business operations we have to support our communities 
and state.It requires a depth of strength intelligence, initiative, self discipline, hard 
work and devotion to establish ones own business, firm or organization to keep it 
operating at a functional economic level. That is why these Noncomplete Clauses 
were put in place, to support economy and community. The dismissal of the 
Noncompleted Clauses would be allowing business practices and proceedures to be 
"stolen" from the foundation of the business.
