Testimony on behalf of the Maine Independent Colleges Association 
In Support of 
LD 1016, An Act to Support College Student Participation as Policy Interns for State 
Legislators 
Committee on State and Local Government 
April 20, 2023 
 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and Members of the State and Local Government 
Committee, 
 
My name is Dan Walker, and I represent the Maine Independent Colleges Association in support 
of LD 1016, which seeks to create a legislative internship program for college students from 
Maine. 
 
MICA represents 11 private, nonprofit colleges and universities1 throughout Maine that serve over 
17,000 students, with more than half from Maine.  Collectively, the 11 institutions are an economic 
force and an integral part of Maine’s Higher Educational eco-system. While they share the 
attributes of being private and nonprofit, these institutions are highly diverse and serve very 
different aspects of the educational needs of Maine people.  
 
Students from MICA institutions participate in internships throughout the State and state 
government, and MICA would support a more formalized legislative internship program that 
would be available to students from the diverse group of MICA institutions.  MICA especially 
supports the amended version of the bill that would create a Committee to study the development 
of a legislative internship pilot program, and we would be happy to particiapte in such a 
Committee. 
 
Thank you for your consideration of this worthy legislative effort.
