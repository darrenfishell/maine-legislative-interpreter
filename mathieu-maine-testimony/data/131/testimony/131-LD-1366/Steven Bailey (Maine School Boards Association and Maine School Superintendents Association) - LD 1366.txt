TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 1366 
AN ACT TO ADDRESS EDUCATIONAL TECHNICIAN SHORTAGES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BY 
ESTABLISHING AN ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION PATHWAY 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 1366. 
Teachers are tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that all their students leam, and Educational 
Technicians play a key role in that process. They support the teacher to ensure that all students get the 
maximum beneﬁt from the leaming activities the teacher plans and carries out for them. 
They also help create a safe, nurturing and happy environment so students can leam. Educational Technicians 
provide support to the teacher by working with students individually or in small groups. They also support 
students who may stmggle in the classroom. 
School districts are facing critical shortages in hiring Educational Technicians. Creating an altemative 
pathway to an Ed Tech III certiﬁcation can alleviate the shortage and help place qualiﬁed individuals in 
Maine’s classrooms. 
The altemate methods described in L.D. 1366 allow for engagement within the Maine Community College 
system, but don’t require this to be the only means for completing training within an altemative certiﬁcation 
pathway. 
MSSA and MSBA urge you to support this legislation because of the important work Ed Techs do in our 
schools in support of our students.
