  April 24, 2023   Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee.  On behalf of the Maine Brewers’ Guild, who represent the interests of the craft beer industry in Maine, including brewers who brew 99.9% of all beer brewed in Maine, we would like to offer testimony in opposition to LD 1695, “An Act to Provide for the Direct Shipment of Spirits to Consumers.”   As more consumers are ordering more things online, this committee may well need to deal with direct-to-consumer shipments of alcohol, but this was not identified as a priority for our members during this legislative session. Any expansion of the ability to ship alcohol directly to consumers in Maine should include all of Maine's many small producers, including wineries, breweries, kombucheries, and distilleries. Accordingly, we oppose the current bill.  Thank you for consideration of our testimony, and please note we would be happy to discuss this matter further at any time.   Sincerely,  /s/Heather Sanborn  Heather Sanborn Legislative Committee Chair, Maine Brewers’ Guild
