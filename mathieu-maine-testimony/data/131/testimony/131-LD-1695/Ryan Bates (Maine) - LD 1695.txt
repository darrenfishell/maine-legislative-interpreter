Here we go again.!!  This bill is absolutely anti Maine business... we operate a very 
strong and regulated business in the state.  This bill eliminates all kinds of public 
safety and regulatory standards.   
As a born and raised Maine person who has stayed here to operate a very heavily 
regulated business, I can't believe that we are even bringing this up again. 
The entire thought process of any of this "proposed bill" is completely against any of 
the many standards in which we all operate (state/wholesale/retail)!
The thought of a "person"; regardless of actual verification of age/soberness/intent to 
be able to order a controlled substance and have it show up on a doorstep is certainly 
asking for so much trouble!...Just the thought of it is astonishing! 
As a father of a teenager with every screen available...the answer is a very clear NO.
Thank-you all for the consideration.
