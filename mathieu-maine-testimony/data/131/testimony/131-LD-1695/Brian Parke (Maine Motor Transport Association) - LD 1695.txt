rzumaa-412: 
Good morning, Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Committee On 
Veterans and Legal Affairs. My name is Brian Parke and I am the President and CEO of the 
Maine MotorTransport Association and a resident of Brunswick. The Association is 
comprised of more than 1,700 member companies, whose employees make up a large 
portion of the 34,000 people who make their living in the trucking industry in Maine. 
l am here to testify neither for nor against LD 1695 and to provide additional information 
relative to the common carrier component of the legislation. 
lf the result of passing this bill is that common carriers need to follow the exact same 
regulations as they do for Direct to ConsumeriWine deliveries outlined in MRSA Title 28-A,§ 
1403-A then we probably wouldn’t be weighing in on this bill. The members we have heard 
from on this bill are comfortable with the standard data elements they capture now, including 
who the package is from, who it is being sent to, the weight and the tracking number. What 
they would not be comfortable with, and would object to, is if there were any additional data 
elements added for things they do not have access to now such as total number of cases, 
quantity and purchase price of each shipment. That additional information, if included, would 
need to be reported by the shipper, not the carrier. 
Thank you for allowing me to testify and provide our perspective on the bill. l would be happy 
to answer any questions the committee has now or at the Work Session.
