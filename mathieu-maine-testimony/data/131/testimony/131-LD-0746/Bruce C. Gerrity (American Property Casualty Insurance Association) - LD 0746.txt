RE; LD 623 - An Act to Modify Maine Motor Vehicle Inspection Standards to Permit 
Nonstructural Corrosion That Does Not Directly Affect the Passenger 
CompartmentI 
LD 746 - An Act to Modernize the State's Vehicle Inspection System by Requiring 
Inspections Biennially and Allowing for an Electronic Inspection Program“ 
Dear Senator Chipman and Representative Williams:' 
The American Property and Casualty Insurance Association submits this testimony in 
opposition to LDs 623 and 746, both of which would weaken Maine’s current inspection laws.' 
Maine’s inspection program results in safer cars and saves lives. This issue has been raiseda 
number of times before this Committee. In the 130"‘ Legislature the Committee reviewed LDs 
284, 354, 388, 431, 490, 565 and 712. In the 129"‘ Legislature the bills were LDs 110, 117, 270 
and 389. Similar bills have been proposed before in a number of prior legislatures. The beneﬁts 
of Maine’s inspection laws include, among other things, lower insurance costs and safer motor 
vehicles. 
The value of inspection laws is conﬁrmed by a study conducted by the Pennsylvania 
Department of Transportation in March of 2009. ~' 
The Executive Summary states: 
T his report describes the activities and results for the Vehicle Safety Inspection Program 
(VSIP) Eﬁfectiveness Study... performed by Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS) on behalf of 
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (Pe'nnDOT). The research considered 
the eﬂfectiveness of vehicle safety inspections on the number of fatal crashes, and the 
cost-eﬂfectiveness of the program compared to the cost of inspections to the owners of 
Pennsylvania registered vehicles. The results of the research clearly demonstrate that 
the Vehicle Safety Inspection program in Pennsylvania is effective and saves lives. 
(Emphasis in original.)" 
_ ' 
APCIA does not oppose the provisions in LD 746 that allow for an electronic inspection program, but does oppose 
the remainder of the bill.'

Currently Maine enjoys what the Bureau of Insurance calls “the Trifecta. ” Maine has one 
of the lowest uninsured motorist percentages in the nation (+/- 4.5%). It has the second or third 
lowest premiums and it has the highest minimum mandated insurance limits in the country. In 
part, these enviable rankings are the product of Maine’s inspection laws. Simply put, cars that 
are able to pass annual inspections are safer, result in fewer mechanical failures and fewer 
accidents. 
The Association respectfully urges the Committee to vote LD 623 and section l of LD 
746 out Ought Not To Pass. -
