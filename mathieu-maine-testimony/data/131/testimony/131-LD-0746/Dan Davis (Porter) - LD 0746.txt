Senator Chipman, Representative Stover, and State & Local Government Committee 
members, 
I support moving to a biennial inspection process. Should people feel the need for 
annual inspections rather than maintaining it themselves, if that makes them feel more
comfortable, then they are more than capable of continuing to purchase that service, at
the frequency they desire, on their own.
Thank you,
Dan
