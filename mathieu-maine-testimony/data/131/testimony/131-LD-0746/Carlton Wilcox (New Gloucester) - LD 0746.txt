Critical Reasons for Crashes Investigated in the 
National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey
†  95% conf. limits: ± tα/2; deg. freedom × Std. Dev. ( α = 0.05, t-value = 2.179)Summary
The National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey 
(NMVCCS), conducted from 2005 to 2007 , was aimed at col -
lecting on-scene information about the events and associ -
ated factors leading up to crashes involving light vehicles. 
Several facets of crash occurrence were investigated during 
data collection, namely the pre-crash movement, critical pre-
crash event, critical reason for the critical pre-crash event, and 
the associated factors. In each investigated crash, these were 
assigned to driver, vehicle, or environment without suggest -
ing that any of these was cause of the crash or assignment 
of fault to driver, vehicle, or other crash element. A sample 
of 5,470 NMVCCS-qualified crashes (i.e., the crashes meeting 
certain criteria listed in the section:  Scope and Limitations 
of NMVCCS data) was investigated over a period of two and 
a half years, which represents an estimated 2,189,000 crashes 
nationwide. About 4,031,000 vehicles, 3,945,000 drivers, and 
1,982,000 passengers were estimated to have been involved 
in these crashes. The critical reason, which is the last event 
in the crash causal chain, was assigned to the driver in 94 
percent (±2.2%)† of the crashes. In about 2 percent (±0.7%) 
of the crashes, the critical reason was assigned to a vehicle 
component’s failure or degradation, and in 2 percent (±1.3%) 
of crashes, it was attributed to the environment (slick roads, 
weather, etc.). Among an estimated 2,046,000 drivers who 
were assigned critical reasons, recognition errors accounted 
for about 41 percent (±2.1%), decision errors 33 percent (±3.7%), 
and performance errors 11 percent (±2.7%) of the crashes.
Introduction
Databases such as the National Automotive Sampling 
System (NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) do not 
provide information on pre-crash scenarios and the reasons 
underlying the critical pre-crash events. In 2005, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was autho -
rized under Section 2003(c) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, 
Efficient, Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users 
(SAFETEA-LU) to conduct a national survey to collect on-
scene data pertaining to events and associated factors that 
possibly contributed to crash occurrence. NHTSA’s National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) conducted the 
NMVCCS from July 3, 2005, to December 31, 2007 . Crashes 
were investigated at the crash scene to collect driver, vehicle, 
and environment-related information pertaining to crash 
occurrence, with a focus on driver’s role. The targeted infor -
mation was captured mainly through four data elements: (i) 
movement prior to critical pre-crash event (i.e., the movement 
of the vehicle immediately before the occurrence of the criti -
cal event); (ii) critical pre-crash event (i.e., the circumstance 
that led to vehicle’s first impact); (iii) critical reason for the 
critical pre-crash event (i.e., the immediate reason for the crit -
ical event, which is often the last failure in the causal chain 
of events leading up to the crash); and (iv) the crash associ -
ated factors (i.e., the factors that are likely to add to the prob -
ability of crash occurrence). This was done with reference to 
the crash envelope that comprises of a sequence of events, 
referring to the above data elements, which eventually led 
to the crash. Refer to the section Scope and Limitations of 
NMVCCS data.
This Crash•Stats presents some statistics related to one of the 
above-mentioned four data elements, namely “critical reason 
for the critical pre-crash event.” The data obtained through 
the sample of 5,470 NMVCCS crashes and the weights asso -
ciated with them were used to obtain national estimates of 
frequencies and percentages along with their 95-percent con -
fidence limits, as presented in the following sections.
Critical Reasons for the Critical Pre‑Crash Event
The critical reason is the immediate reason for the critical pre-crash 
event and is often the last failure in the causal chain of events lead -
ing up to the crash. Although the critical reason is an important 
part of the description of events leading up to the crash, it is not 
intended to be interpreted as the cause of the crash nor as the assign -
ment of the fault to the driver, vehicle, or environment.
A critical reason can be assigned to a driver, vehicle, or envi -
ronment. Normally, one critical reason was assigned per 
crash, based upon NMVCCS researcher’s crash assessment 
without suggesting the cause of the crash or assignment of 
fault. The critical reason was assigned to the driver in an esti -

mated 94 percent (±2.2%) of the NMVCCS-qualified crashes 
(Table 1). In addition, the critical reason was assigned to the 
vehicle in an estimated 2 percent (±0.7%) and to the environ -
ment in about 2 percent (±1.3%) of the crashes.

Critical reason attributed to drivers
The critical reason was assigned to drivers in an estimated 
2,046,000 crashes that comprise 94 percent of the NMVCCS 
crashes at the national level. However, in none of these 
crashes was the assignment intended to blame the driver 
for causing the crash. The driver-related critical reasons are 
broadly classified into recognition errors, decision errors, 
performance errors, and non-performance errors. Statistics 
in Table 2 show that the recognition error, which included 
driver’s inattention, internal and external distractions, and 
inadequate surveillance, was the most frequently assigned 
(41% ±2.2%) critical reason. Decision errors such as driving 
too fast for conditions, too fast for the curve, false assump -
tion of others’ actions, illegal maneuver and misjudgment of 
gap or others’ speed accounted for about 33 percent (±3.7%) 
of the crashes. In about 11 percent (±2.7%) of the crashes, 
the critical reason was performance error such as overcom -
pensation, poor directional control, etc. Sleep was the most 
common critical reason among non-performance errors that 
accounted for 7 percent (±1.0%) of the crashes. Other driver 
errors were recorded as critical reasons for about 8 percent 
(±1.9%) of the drivers.Table 2. Driver ‑Related Critical Reasons

(Data Source: NMVCCS 2005–2007)
Critical reason attributed to vehicles
The critical reason was assigned to vehicles in an estimated 
44,000 crashes comprising about 2 percent of the NMVCCS 
crashes, though none of these reasons implied a vehicle 
causing the crash. There were no detailed inspections of 
vehicles during the NMVCCS on-scene crash investigation; 
the vehicle-related critical reasons were mainly inferred 
through external visual inspection of the vehicle compo -
nents. This resulted in only mostly external, easily visible 
factors (tires, brakes, steering column, etc.) that were cited 
as the few vehicle-related critical reasons. The related statis -
tics may not, therefore, be representative of the role of other 
internal vehicle related problems that might have led to the 
crash. Of the small percentage (2%) of the crashes in which 
the critical reason was assigned to the vehicle, the tire prob -
lem accounted for about 35 percent (±11.4%) of the crashes. 
Brake-related problems as critical reasons accounted for 
about 22 percent (±15.4%) of such crashes. Steering/suspen -
sion/transmission/engine-related problems were assigned 
as critical reasons in 3 percent (±3.3%) of such crashes. Other 
vehicle-related problems were assigned as critical reason in 
about 40 percent (±24.0%) percent of such crashes.

13421-031518-v3Critical reason attributed to environment
The critical reason was assigned to about 2 percent of the 
estimated 2,189,000 NMVCCS crashes. However, none of 
these is suggestive of the cause of the crash. Table 4 pres -
ents statistics related to crashes in which the critical reason 
was attributed to roadway and atmospheric conditions. In 
about 50 percent (±14.5%) of the 52,000 crashes the critical 
reason was attributed to slick roads. Glare as a critical reason 
accounted for about 17 percent (±16.7%) of the environment-
related crashes, and view obstruction was assigned in 11 per -
cent (±7 .2%) of the crashes. Signs and signals accounted for 3 
percent (±2.5%) of such crashes. In addition, in 52,000 of the 
crashes with a critical reason attributed to the environment, 
the weather condition (fog/rain/snow) was cited in 4 percent 
(±2.9%) of the crashes.

(Data Source: NMVCCS 2005–2007)Scope and Limitations of NMVCS Data
NMVCCS data is restricted to crashes that occurred from 
6 a.m. to midnight. In addition, the following criteria must 
be met by a crash to qualify for an on-scene investigation 
(NMVCCS-qualified crash):
n The crash must have resulted in a harmful event associ -
ated with a vehicle in transport on a trafficway. 
n EMS must have been dispatched to the crash scene. 
n At least one of the first three crash-involved vehicles 
must be present at the crash scene when the NMVCCS 
researcher arrives. 
n The police must be present at the scene of the crash when 
the NMVCCS researcher arrives. 
n At least one of the first three vehicles involved in the 
crash must be a light passenger vehicle that was towed 
or will be towed due to damage. 
n A completed police accident report for this crash must be 
available.
It is important to note that the pre-crash assessment of crashes 
in terms of the critical event, critical reasons, and associated 
factors is neither suggestive of the cause of the crash nor of 
a fault to the driver, vehicle, or environment. Therefore, care 
needs to be taken in interpreting the results of the explor -
atory and descriptive analyses of the data or of the clinical 
investigation. Since NMVCCS only collects data on crashes 
that meet the above-mentioned criteria, the estimates based 
on NMVCCS data should not be compared with those from 
other databases such as NHTSA’s General Estimates System 
(GES) or the NASS-CDS.

State auto inspections are worthless and corrupt.  It is a waste of resources from 
actions that would actually improve auto safety.  Per the attached extensive study by 
NHTSA 96% of auto accidents are due to the driver, 2% due to weather, 2% unknown
cause, and 2% due to the vehicle condition.  In 2020, the most recent data is publicly 
available, 39% of all traffic fatalities the primary cause was alcohol. 29% due to 
excessive speed, 13% were unhelmeted motorcyclist. Per NHTSA 2% of the 164 
fatalities would be from the vehicle condition.  Why are we wasted our time and 
money with vehicle safety inspections?  35 other states have done away with them 
and Maine should as well.  Safety inspections are nothing more than an opportunity to
be taken advantage of by auto shops.
