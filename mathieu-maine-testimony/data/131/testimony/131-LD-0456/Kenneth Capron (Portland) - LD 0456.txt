Bicycles need to be registered and have a license plate if it is going to use the public 
roads. Period. We need to be able to track down bikes that have damaged people or 
property in a hit and run.
Bicycles should also have some form of lighting in the dark and an audio alarm to 
alert other vehicles to their presence. And cyclists using the public ROW should be 
required to wear helmets.
At some point in the future, bicycles should be equipped with some form of airbag(s).
