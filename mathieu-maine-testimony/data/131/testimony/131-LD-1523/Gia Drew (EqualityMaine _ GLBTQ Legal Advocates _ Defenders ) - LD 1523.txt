An
Act
to
Establish
a
Qualifying
Condition
Review
Board
to
Provide
Benefits
to
Certain
Service
Members.

Senator
Hickman,
Representative
Supica,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Veterans
and
Legal
Affairs:
my
name
is
Gia
Drew
and
I’m
presenting
this
testimony
on
behalf
of
EqualityMaine,
the
statewide
LGBTQ+
civil
rights
organization
founded
in
1984.
Supporting
this
bill
with
us
are
GLBTQ
Legal
Advocates
&
Defenders
(GLAD).
Additionally ,
I
am
a
proud
member
of
a
military
family,
with
three
nephews
actively
serving
our
country
in
the
Army
and
Navy.
Personally ,
when
I
was
graduating
high
school
in
1985,
I
seriously
considered
joining
the
service,
like
my
dad
and
his
brothers
had,
but
I
didn’t
feel
I
could
serve
in
secret
being
an
LGBTQ+
person.
We
thank
LGBTQ+
Veterans
who
served
their
country
with
honor
and
pride
and
we
support
LD
1523:
An
Act
to
Establish
a
Qualifying
Condition
Review
Board
to
Provide
Benefits
to
Certain
Service
Members.
This
bill
would
establish
a
board
to
review
other
than
honorable
discharges
based
on
sexual
orientation,
gender
identity,
sexual
orientation,
PTSD,
TBI
(traumatic
brain
injury),
and
MST
(military
sexual
trauma).
Previously ,
we
strongly
supported
LD
173

in
the
130st
legislature
that
compelled
The
Maine
Bureau
of
Veterans’
Services
with
creating
a
report

to
assist
the
Maine
State
Legislature
better
understand
the
issue
of
“Bad
Paper
''
military
discharges
negatively
affecting
veterans
and
their
access
to
state
and
federal
benefits.
According
to
the
Maine
Bureau
of
Veterans’
Services,
between
the
end
of
World
War
II
and
the
2010
repeal
of
“Don’t
Ask,
Don’t
Tell,”
it
is
estimated
that
more
than
100,000
veterans
were
involuntarily
discharged
from
service
due
to
their
sexual
orientation.
And
until
just
two
years
ago,
transgender
service
members
were
being
kicked
out
of
the
military.
Adding
insult
to
injury,
these
service
members
were
then
denied
the
services
and
benefits
they
earned
as
members
of
our
armed
forces
who
fought
to
protect

country
and
defend
our
ideals.
Following
the
repeal
of
“Don’t
Ask,
Don’t
Tell,”
the
federal
government
set
up
a
process
by
which
veterans
can
apply
to
get
reinstated
and
become
eligible
for
the
benefits
they
earned.
From
our
conversations
with
The
Maine
Bureau,
with
veterans,
and
information
presented
in
the
report,
that
process
can
take
years.
That
is
far
too
long,
and
many
veterans
don’t
even
know
this
option
exists.
Federal
legislation
has
been
introduced
to
improve
the
process
in
every
Congress
since
2013,
yet
remains
stalled.
But,
just
this
February,
The
White
House
vowed
to
"reevaluate"
the
process
for
LGBTQ+
veterans
seeking
upgrades
to
discriminatory
discharges.

The
Board
can
gather
the
necessary
documentation
both
for
approval
of
State
Veterans’
benefits
and,
with
the
record
built
there,
for
a
more
streamlined
process
for
federal
benefits
as
well.
The
potential
impact
of
this
change
cannot
be
understated.
Approximately
9.7%
of
Maine’s
population
consists
of
veterans.

(Sept.

We
support
the
creation
of
a
Qualifying
Condition
Review
Board
that
could
be
effective
and
beneficial
to
LGBTQ+
veterans,
and
the
others
also
acknowledged
in
this
bill
who
also
served
our
country
and
received
an
Other
than
Honorable
character
of
discharge
from
the
military
due
to
PTSD,
TBI,
MST,
or
a
combination
of
these
reasons.
To
close,
LGBTQ+
people
and
the
other
veterans
addressed
in
this
bill
and
who
serve
our
country
in
the
armed
forces
deserve
recognition,
respect,
and
the
benefits
they
earned
for
their
service,
just
like
all
other
veterans.
Unfortunately ,
that
hasn’t
been
the
case.
Our
state
has
long
been
a
leader
in
recognizing
that
our
LGBTQ+
friends,
family,
coworkers,
and
neighbors
should
be
treated
the
same
as
everyone
else.
We
urge
you
to
support
LD
1523
for
all
veterans
who
need
this
support
and
to
and
pass
this
bill.
Thank
you.
