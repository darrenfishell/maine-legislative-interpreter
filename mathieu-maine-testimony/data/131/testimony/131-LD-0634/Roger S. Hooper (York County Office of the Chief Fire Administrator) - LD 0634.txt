RE: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO LD634 
Dear Committee Members: 
I am writing in opposition to LD 634 An Act to Allow Open Burning in the Snow Without a 
Permit. 
Passage of this bill will create confusion over needs for a permit, hinder the enforcement of 
existing open buming and air quality laws, and endanger the general public safety. It will create an 
added burden on Fireﬁghters. It will remove any accountability for violating open burning and air 
quality laws. 
The items I mention in the previous paragraph are facts. They have occurred before in Maine. 
They resulted in changes to Maine’s open burning laws to require permits year-round, regardless of 
snow cover. Roughly, 30-35 years ago the law did not require open burning permits when the ground 
was completely covered by snow. The resulting problem was differences in the interpretation of the 
word “completely ” . People will make interpretations based on their desires. Education and enforcement 
did not occur. People often burned anything. Tires, for example. Without a permit there is an assumption 
that no one is watching. A permit brings accountability. 
Pennits are easily and instantly obtainable on-one, 24/7/3 65. They are free. 
LD 634 is unnecessary. It is regressive. It is several steps backwards. Please end this bill. 
Very Respectfully, 
M tr“ oger . ooper 
Chief Fire Administrator, York County
