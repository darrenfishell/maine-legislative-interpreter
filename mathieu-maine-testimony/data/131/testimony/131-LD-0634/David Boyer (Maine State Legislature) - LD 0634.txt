Testimony of Representative David Boyer 
Presenting L.D. 634, An Act to Allow Open Burning in the Snow 
Without a Permit 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation, and Forestry 
February 27, 2023 
Senator lngwersen, Representative Plucker and distinguished 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, l am Representative David Boyer. l am 
here today in support of L.D. 634, An Act to Allow Open Burning in 
the Snow Without a Permit. 
Passing this bill would ease the burden on local officials when the 
threat of wildfire is non-existent due to snow covered ground or being 
on a frozen body of water. 
My understanding is that the committee is already wrestling with this 
section of law so l hope you consider this common-sense change in 
your discussions. Thank you for your consideration.
