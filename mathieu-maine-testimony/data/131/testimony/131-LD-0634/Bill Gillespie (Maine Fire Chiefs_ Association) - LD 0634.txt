Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker, and distinguished members of the Agriculture 
Conservation and Forestry Committee. Please accept this written testimony on behalf of the Maine Fire 
Chiefs Association in opposition to LD 634. in the 130"‘ Legislature the cost to receive a burn permit was 
eliminated to ease the financial burden to the people of the state of Maine. 
The benefit of a Burn Permit request will ensure that the Fire Chief or Town Fire Wardens will be made 
aware of a permitted burn within their town. The permit process also informs the holder of acceptable 
materials to burn. This will prevent the increase in call volume of the Fire Department being requested 
to investigate unnecessary calls. 
Respectfully 
Chief Bill Gillespie 
Maine Fire Chiefs Legislative Liaison & Liberty Fire Department
