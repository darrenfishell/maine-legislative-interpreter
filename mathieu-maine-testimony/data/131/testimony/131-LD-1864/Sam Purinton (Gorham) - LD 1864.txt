Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and Members of the Joint Select Committee on 
Housing:
My name is Sam, and I am a resident of Gorham village. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of  LD 1864, “An Act to Increase Maine’s Housing Supply by 
Prohibiting Certain Zoning Requirements where  Public Sewer and Water 
Infrastructure are available and in Designated Growth Areas.”
I live Gorham village. It's a quaint area with several local businesses. It is a 15 minute
walk from my house. It is a center for jobs. Living near Gorham village does not force
me to own a car. In many towns, such quaint, New England style villages are now 
illegal to build because of onerous minimum lot sizes. This bill will help make 
building new livable villages more viable in towns where inertia and other priorities 
have prevented them from taking action. It will bring attention to the major headwind 
that is large minimum lot sizes. I support this bill and hope it becomes law.
Sam
