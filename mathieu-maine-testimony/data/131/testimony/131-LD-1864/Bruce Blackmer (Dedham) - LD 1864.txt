LD 1864 
To Chairpersons Teresa Pierce, Traci Gere, and the members of the Housing Committee: 
0 My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham, Maine. 
0 I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and Managers 
Association, GBAOMA. 
0 I am also a member of the Legislative Council working closely with, Attorney and Lobbyist, Dan 
Bernier representing landlords and property owners in, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, 
Portland, South Portland, Lewiston, Auburn, and Bangor areas. 
0 l have been a landlord since 1972. l have owned a 50-unit trailer park , mult1' â€”unit, and single- 
family homes. At one time, I managed 65 units. I have mostly provided affordable housing to 
low-income tenants. . 
0 I am speaking in opposition of LD 1864 as it is written. 
0 LD 1864 could do a lot to provide affordable housing. However, most municipalities cannot be 
trusted to provide a proper growth area because of the NOT IN MY BACKYARD MENTALITY. 
LD 1864 should be amended to say that the growth area is anywhere that there is public 
transportation, and also that there should be no parking requirements. An area for parking may 
keep the expansion from happening. If tenants have a vehicle, then they can look for a unit with 
parking. However, if a tenant does not have a vehicle, than a no parking unit should be cheaper 
for the tenant. 
0 I am here to ask you to oppose LD 1864 as it is written and please consider my suggestions. 
0 Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. I would be happy to answer any questions.
