I am writing on behalf of GreenMars Real Estate Services to express our strong 
support for LD1864, which promotes infill housing in municipalities with designated 
growth areas. This crucial legislation represents a significant step towards achieving 
the State's smart growth goals, which aim to foster compact settlements while 
preserving open spaces on the fringes of towns.
At GreenMars Real Estate Services, we have witnessed firsthand the challenges 
posed by antiquated zoning policies that have hindered the State's efforts to combat 
sprawl, mitigate climate change, utilize land efficiently, and promote public health. The 
current zoning regulations often favor large lot sizes and spread-out development 
patterns, leading to increased reliance on private vehicles, fragmented communities, 
and the loss of valuable open spaces.
LD1864 offers a well-considered solution by allowing traditional sized lots in 
designated growth areas with existing infrastructure. By encouraging infill housing, the 
legislation promotes the efficient utilization of available land and encourages a more 
sustainable development model. This approach aligns perfectly with the State's smart 
growth goals and will help to revitalize established neighborhoods, enhance 
community connectivity, and reduce the need for extensive infrastructure expansion.
Infill housing has numerous benefits for both the residents and the environment. It 
facilitates the revitalization of underutilized or vacant areas, reducing blight and 
creating vibrant communities. By utilizing existing infrastructure, such as transportation 
networks, utilities, and public services, infill housing minimizes the strain on resources 
and reduces the cost of development. It also provides more housing options, including 
affordable and workforce housing, which can help address the State's housing 
shortage and promote socio-economic diversity.
Moreover, LD1864 contributes significantly to climate mitigation efforts. By promoting 
infill housing, the legislation discourages urban sprawl and preserves valuable open 
spaces, thereby reducing habitat destruction and the loss of natural resources. It also 
supports a compact development pattern that encourages walking, biking, and the use 
of public transportation, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 
improved air quality.
GreenMars Real Estate Services firmly believes that LD1864 represents a necessary 
and timely solution to the challenges faced by the State in achieving its smart growth 
goals. We commend the legislature for scheduling a public hearing on this important 
legislation and urge all members of the Legislative Committee  to support LD1864. By 
embracing infill housing and allowing traditional sized lots in designated growth areas, 
we can create more sustainable, connected, and vibrant communities while preserving 
the State's invaluable open spaces.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to the continued progress 
towards smart growth and sustainable development in our great state.
Sincerely,
Nate Green& Chris Marshall
