What is Sprawl? Information and Tools for Citizen Planners 
More Tools Available at GrowSmartMaine—www.growsmartmaine.org  
    Introduction Do you have to get in your car to go about your daily life, driving from home to work, to shop, to shuttle children between activities, to partake in leisure activities?  Have you ever wondered why so much of life depends on a car? One of the reasons is sprawl.    A Definition of Sprawl Sprawl is a pattern of development that disperses the built environment and has these general characteristics:  • Homes, offices, shopping, recreation, etc. are separated     from each other so walking between uses is difficult and sometimes dangerous. • Different kinds of people defined by age and ability, income, and ethnicity are often segregated. • Public buildings, such as schools, post offices and town halls are isolated from other parts of the community. • Commercial and retail development are accompanied by an expanse of parking spaces. • Large open spaces are divided into smaller parcels and their natural resource function is lost, no longer serving their agricultural or wildlife use.  Sprawl is a dominant development pattern in the United States, and in Maine.  It is often described as suburban type development, though it can look more like rural in places where development is scattered over large open spaces. Both residential and commercial development can create sprawl. Some of the Reasons for Sprawl  The automobile has helped make sprawl possible. Cars offer flexibility to live where home, work, shopping, and recreation are spread apart, requiring driving for daily life.   Local zoning ordinances often promote sprawl, with large lot requirements for homes, outdated minimum parking requirements, and separation of different types of land uses. In addition, local ordinances are often stricter for new development in built-up areas, creating an unintended incentive to develop in rural areas.  State policies can also subsidize sprawl. For example, state aid for school construction has favored growing suburbs at the expense of older hub towns and rural towns.  How Do You Know if it’s Sprawl?  Is your community showing signs of sprawl? Some of the ways to tell include:  • If most of the new development is either spread out along major roads (e.g. strip development) or is on streets that dead end (e.g. cul-de-sacs). • If the local school is far from the community center and you have to drive to get there. • If town hall, the post office, or a place of worship isn’t part of a village or business district where you can walk to do other errands after registering your car, mailing a package, or worshiping. • If almost everyone drives to pick up a pizza.  Why Does This Matter?  Sprawl is an inefficient and costly pattern of development, with financial, environmental, climate, and social impacts.  The Cost of Sprawl, an older, but still relevant publication, takes a look at these impacts in Maine. And a companion GrowSmart Maine Community Guide, The Creeping Cost of Sprawl, explains the incremental, cumulative fiscal impacts of sprawl on communities. In the long run, sprawl is an unsustainable pattern of development.  Communities Can Choose   There are alternatives to sprawl. Communities can choose a different pattern of development. GrowSmart helps communities understand and consider alternatives. We hope you will explore our Community Guides for information about “smart growth” and other ways to navigate growth and change in your community.  Residential Sprawl   Single-family homes,   • built at one per lot spread over large areas, • beyond walking distance of  goods and services, and • occupied by persons who, of necessity or choice, commute by automobile.  Commercial Sprawl   Auto-oriented development,  • with many square feet of parking for every square foot  of actual building space, • usually located in strips along major   routes or in business parks, and • usually separate from other  land uses.   
THE CREEPING COSTS OF SPRAWL

Is Your Fuse Lit?  
Do you live in a rural town within a 30 - or 40 -minute 
drive of a job center? Is your population growing? Has 
the population reached 2,500? Is there at least one 
home per 20 acres in town (for example, 1,000 homes 
in a town of about 30 square miles?) ? 
 
If you answered yes to any three of these questions,  administration rises to about a tenth of the budget. 
Other services, such as parks and recreation, may be 
introduced for the first time.

The One -Two Punch  
Suburban sprawl happens at two scales. The first is 
regional: the leapfrogging of development across 
boundaries into towns 10, 20, even 40 minutes away 
from traditional job or “service” centers. The second is 
local: low -density households spreading out of the 
town’s villages into its rural territories.  
 
Together, they are a one -two punch on local budgets.  
 
In the first instance, it is regional sprawl that matters 
most. In most regions, the spreading out of the 
population happens over such a large area that any 
town experiences it incrementally. But looking at it 
over a period of two or three decades reveals an 
unmistakable  pattern.  
 
The best indicator is the size of population itself. For 
most Maine towns with populations under 2,500, the 
sense of being in a  rural place is strong: not just in the 
landscape, but also in town government. Town 
government likely depends on a town meeting, is very 
part-time, involves many volunteers, and delivers only 
limited town services beyond K -12 education.  
 
When a town passe s the 2,500 to 3,500 mark, it 
experiences a notable change. On average, local costs 
for non -educational services increase from less than 
30% of the total budget to more than a third (See 
Chart 1, from the Maine Municipal Association) . The 
pressure grows to  deliver more services and on a more 
full-time basis.  
 
Above the 5,000 mark, non -educational costs on 
average approach 45% of the total. Costs required for 
public safety services go from about 5% of the total to 
about 11%. The share required for general  Population in Thousands  
The Rise of the 2,500+  Town  
More and more towns are passing the 2,500, 3,500, 
and 5,000 population thresholds. This is due only in 
part to overall population growth in Maine, which has 
been modest. It is due primarily to a migration of the 
population out of service centers - first to close -in 
suburbs, then to second - and third -tier suburbs, 
especially in southern, central, and coastal  Maine.  
 
In 1960, only 80 of Maine’s 489 organized 
municipalities had populations over 2,500 , 
including 61 above 3,500 and 38 above 5,000. In 
2000, these numbers had increased to 131 , 96 
and 58 respectively. By 2015, the State Planning 
Office projects nearly 150 municipalities, about 
30% of the total statewide, will have passed the 2,500 
mark. Se e Charts 2 and  3.

of Sprawl   
 
 
In fact, by 2015, more than half the municipalities 
in Maine’s southern 7 counties – 74 out of 135 – 
will have populations of over 3,500, and more than a 
third of them (48) will have populations of over 5,000. 
This means increased demand for services, bigger 
budgets, and hi gher local property taxes. It is a one - 
two punch against rural towns.”  
 
Creeping Costs  
 
Suburbanizing towns may not appreciate the fiscal 
impacts that await them. That’s because they do not 
experience the fiscal effects of the one -two punch until 
much lat er. The fuse, once lit, takes 10 -15 years to 
ignite the spending associated with sprawl. By then, 
other things may get the blame: the school board for 
not controlling costs, the state for not handing out 
more aid, the teachers for asking higher salaries, e tc. 
But sprawl lit the fuse.  
 
In the early years of suburbanization – when 
incremental development is spread over a large area 
and rural character still dominates – the per capita 
costs of town services actually fall.  
 
Why? Because towns are frugal. They a bsorb the first 
waves of growth within the same voluntary 
governmental structure that has served them well over 
the years. Selectmen carry out most executive 
functions. Many staff are part -time or wear two or 
more hats. The fire department is all -volunteer . The 
town relies on the county sheriff for police services. A 
road commissioner performs the duties of public 
works. There is no recreation department. Most costs 
are school -related.  
 
This describes Standish in 1970. Suburbanization had 
begun slowly in the 1960s, and in 1970 the population 
reached about 3,100. Throughout the 1970s and into 
the 1980s, suburbanization accelerated. But the town 
worked hard to absorb the growth “at the margins” – that is, within its existing capabilities. As a result, real 
per capita spending dropped by more than 40% (See 
Chart 4).  
 
But this bottomed out in 1984 -85. The “margins” were 
all used up. By then the population was well over 
5,000. The town switched to a manager -council form 
of government and added capacity in schools, public 
works, public safety, and community services. By 
2000, the real per capita costs had returned to their 
1970 level and were still rising. By 2003, general 
government was 10% of the expenditures, and total 
non-school expenses were 40% of the  total. 
 
The result is the U -shaped cost curve you see below on 
Chart 4. On the 15 -year downslope,  the  creeping 
fiscal costs of sprawl may be camouflaged.  As  a 
result, concern about sprawl may be small. When the 
turn is made and per capita costs start rising again, so 
does dissatisfaction with higher property taxes. The 
question is whether people connect the town’s fiscal 
situation to the real culprit: regional  sprawl.  
 
Chart 4  
 
 
 
How much of these rising costs are due to  sprawl 
versus other factors beyond a town’s control? Can the 
costs of sprawl be controlled --through good local land 
use decisions (such as directing growth into  village 
areas) --once regional sprawl has engulfed a town? 
What we do know is that as more towns break 
the 2,500 -3,500 mark – not because of 
population growth but because of migration – the 
cost of local government is rising beyond the 
means of  many.

The Great American Neigh borhood  
 
The traditional  neighborhood  - a place where people of all 
ages can live, meet their daily needs,  and spend their 
leisure time, all within walking distance; a place where kid s 
can walk or bike to school and play with friend s in the 
neighborhood; a place where people are brought together 
in their day -to-day lives, creating a sense of shared 
community . Maybe you  remember a neighborh ood like 
this. Or maybe you  live in one  like it today. But in many 
places  this kind of neigh borhood is  hard to find.  In an  age 
of low density suburbs, with local  zoning ordinances that 
often prohibit this kind of ne ighborhood from being built, a  
“Great American Neighbor hood”  (GAN) is the exception, 
and is most often associated with times past.    
 
Yet surveys by the Maine State Planning Office indicate 
many Maine homebuyers are looking for features often 
associated with ol der “traditional” neighborhoods. These 
include:  
 
❖ Walkability  
❖ Proximity to services and amenities  
❖ Places to gather for community and  socializing  
❖ Diversity  
❖ Settings with trees, parks,  and access to nature  
❖ A sense of privacy and quiet  
❖ Limited traffic  
 
 
 
From The Great American Neighborhood – A Guide to Livable Design  (Bruce Towl, artist)  
  
 
As a growing number of people seek to live in places where 
they can find a combination of features mentioned above , 
the “Great American Neighborhood” (also called 
‘Traditional Neighborhood Design’)  is making a comeback.  
This type of neighborhood also promotes a development 
pattern that helps preserve natural resources and rural 
character , while strengthening  community vitality. If your community is looking for alternative way s to accommodate 
growth, a Great American Neighborhood  may offer another 
approach.  
What Makes a Great American 
Neigh borhood?  
 
A Great American N eighborhood can take many forms.  
Just as every c ommunity is different, every Great 
American Neighborhood  is different.  But they all  share 
some combination of the features mentioned above.  Let’s 
look more closely at these features.   
Walka bility  
The ability to walk or bicycle to where you need or want to 
go is at the heart of a Great American Neighborhood . So 
sidewalks and bike paths/ lanes are key  design feature s. 
Both of these amenities help ensure that walking and 
bicycling are convenient  and safe alternatives to the car.  
 
Compact develo pment  and an interconnected street 
network are  also important to  walkability . The desirable 
size of a walkable neighborhood is an area that can be 
walked in about 10 minutes.  
A Mix of Uses , Services and Ame nities  
A Great American Neighborhood provide s a mix of uses 
(i.e. housing, retail, civic, recreation) in close proximity. 
The goal is to provide for  daily needs  within walking  or 
bicycling  distance.  A compact  pattern of development , with 
a mix of uses, ser vices and amenities , allows people to 
stay in the neighborhood to meet their needs .   
Community Gathering Places and Identity  
A Great American Neighborhood  promotes community . It 
encourages people to interact, gather  and socialize with 
one another.  By pr oviding features such as a town square, 
a green, centralized civic buildings (e.g. library, school, 
town hall, community center, etc.), and neighborhood 
parks , people are encouraged to come together.   
 
These featur es also create a distinct  core to help gi ve the 
neighborhood an  identity. The ability to identify one 
neighborhood as distinct from another , with unique 
features and boundaries,  is part of the Great American 
Neighborhood concept.   
Diversity  
Social, economic, cultural and architectural diversity 
provide opportuni ties for variety in the day -to-day lives of 
people .  A Great American Neighborhood  encourages 
diversity through different types of housing , businesses, 
uses, landscape and building design.

Information and Tools for Citizen Planners  
Connection to Nature  
Trees, parks, and access t o nature add to neighborhood 
livability and  the quality of neighborhood life. These spaces 
also have a proven track record of enhancing property 
values, regardless of their size.  Tree lined streets and  
walkways, s mall-scale parks within the neighborhood  
boundary, and larger adjacent open spaces such  as fields 
or woodlands provide a c onnection with nature.  
Public and Private Spaces  
People need both the public realm and privacy in their day -
to-day lives. This is one of the most important elements of 
neighbor hood design. It is related to  human -powered 
mobility , personal interaction s, and freedom from high 
traffic volumes, etc. It is something that is needed on 
every residential lot.  
 
The public -private continuum (as it is sometimes called) 
allows for formal a nd informal interaction with neighbors  
and people passing by , while also meeting the need for 
privacy.  The continuum (illustrated below) includes  the 
following spaces:  
 
Public : the public 40 -50 foot right -of-way, including  the 
street, curbs, and sidewalks  with trees  
Semi -public : one’s front yard  
Semi -private : one’s porch or stoop  
Private : one’s house and back yard  
 
 
  
From The Great American Neighborhood  – A Guide to Livable Design  
 
Protection from Excessive Traffic  
Stree t design is an important feature  of a Great American 
Neighborhood . Streets give the neighborhood its shape.  
Streets also carry traffic that present s both safety and 
noise issues for neighborhood residents.  
 Traffic safety:  Neighborhood traffic is  part of daily life. 
The problem comes when the number of cars is so great 
that crossing the street becomes difficult and safety 
becomes a concern.  The general goal for a neighborhood 
street is no m ore than 2000 vehicles per day. 
Neighborhood cohesion begins to break down at 5000 
cars/day.  (see “Li vable Streets Retested,” Bosselman et 
al., APA Journal, Spring 1999.)  
 
Traffic noise: Traffic volume and traffic speed both 
contribute to traffic noise . Keeping traffic volumes below 
the 2000 mark mentioned above,  and keeping speed limits 
at or less than 2 5 mph, will help  reduce traffic noise. The 
target noise level (measured in decibels (dB)) outside 
homes should be 55 dB . At 65 dB traffic noise becomes  an 
interference —people say they can’t converse, watch TV, 
etc. at this level.   (For comparison, some com mon noise 
levels are : normal conversation, 60 dB; a ringing 
telephone, 80 dB; a tractor, 90 dB; a snowblower, 105 dB; 
and an ambulance siren, 120 dB)  
 
To address both safety and noise concerns, neighborhood 
street design  should direct  commut er or through t raffic 
around , not through , the neighborhood . And the streets 
within a  neighborhood should be designed to discourage 
high speed, high volume cut-through traffic.  To further 
help reduce traffic, streets should also be designed to 
accommodate pedestrians an d bicyclists to promote 
alternatives to driving a car.  
Conclusion  
 
If you are thinking about your community’s future  growth , 
consider whether a  Great American Neighborhood might 
help achieve some of your goals. Are there opportunities to 
expand or improv e existing ne ighborhoods with some of 
the concepts  mentioned above ? Are there opportunities to 
create a new Great American N eighborhood? The G reat 
American Neighborhood  offers features that many people 
are looking for when deciding where to live. The Great  
American Neighborhood could be one of Maine’s best tools 
for balancing a community’s  needs and desires for future 
growth.
