Free Clinics are the only real option for people who do not, for whatever reason, have 
health insurance.  In Downeast Maine, many jobs are seasonal, they do not offer 
insurance, and many people work two or three jobs in fishing, clamming, agriculture, 
the tourist industry and more.  When insurance is offered, it is often "catastrophic", 
meaning that it covers emergency care but has huge deductibles for routine care.  
Many of our patients have chronic issues, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and 
asthma:  these are all conditions that can be managed with good, regular care to keep 
them out of the ER.
