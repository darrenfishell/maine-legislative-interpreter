My name is Judi Jones and I live in Brunswick, Maine. I am writing to ask for your 
support for LD1161, “An Act to Fund Free Health Clinics” and to work to fund the 
bill.
I am a Maine Registered Dental Hygienist and work under Public Health Authority. I 
have volunteered at my local free health clinic, Oasis Free Clinic in Brunswick, as a 
hygienist since 2012. I work full time in our public schools providing preventative 
dental services for underserved students.
Volunteering at Oasis Free Clinic reinforces how important community is. Our 
community is made up of a wide variety of people and not quite so easy to see, a wide
variety of socio-economic status. It is easy to be lulled into a false reality, thinking 
everyone has health care. Many do not, for many, free clinics are their only medical 
care.
I am grateful that Oasis Free Clinic has the wisdom to include dental services for their
patients. Unfortunately, the wait list for patients who need dental care is long. Oral 
health has a direct correlation with overall health. For many, oral health is the last 
problem to be fixed and a problem that often causes physical, social and economic 
problems as a consequence.
Free clinics like Oasis Free Clinic are essential to our Maine communities. Please 
help clinics continue to provide the medical services that so many of us take for 
granted.
Free Clinics run on a lot of hard work, dedicated people and a bit of luck. No one 
should have to count on luck to receive health care. Please pass LD1161 and fund it to
ensure free clinics are able to provide desperately needed health services.
Thank you,
Judi Jones
