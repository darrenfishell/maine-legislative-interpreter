Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services: 
 
My name is Hannah Wright, and I live in Bath, Maine. I am writing to urge you to support 
LD 1161: An Act to Fund the Free Clinics.  As a volunteer physician associate at Oasis 
Free Clinics, I work in a mobile clinic providing healthcare to asylum seeking patients 
living in emergency shelter. I have seen firsthand the tremendous impact that free 
health clinics have on the health and wellbeing of our most vulnerable community 
members.  
 
Without access to affordable healthcare, many individuals in our community suffer 
needlessly and are at increased risk of developing serious health complications. Free 
health clinics provide vital medical services, such as preventive care, chronic disease 
management, and acute care, to those who would otherwise go without. 
 
I strongly urge you to support LD 1161: An Act to Fund the Free Clinics. These clinics 
are essential in ensuring that all individuals have access to the care they need to lead 
healthy and productive lives. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Hannah Wright, MMS, PA-C
