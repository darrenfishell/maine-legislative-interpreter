Hello Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and member of the Committee on Health and 
Human Services, 
My name is Lisa Franklin and l'm an advocate with HVJ . You might recognize me from testifying 
a few other times. l'm here today to testify in support of this program because quite frankly it 
saved my life. l am one of the very fortunate and grateful participants of the H.O.U.S.E. 
program. l became homeless in December of 2019 after fleeing domestic violence that started 
after I remarried. I was already in recovery from Opioid addiction after going to rehab and 
beginning Suboxone treatment and counseling. But after having to flee that situation l knewl 
was in an extremely vulnerable place in my life and the H.O.U.S.E. program provided the 
support that I desperately needed to continue my recovery and start to rebuild my life. Although, 
med management, counseling services, and housing placement assistance was invaluable it 
was the case management sen/ices that really provided the continued support that has allowed 
me to get my life back. l am a mother, a daughter, a friend ,a worker and a child of Maine. 
Without their support I truly believe l would not be standing here in front of you today. The opioid 
epidemic created a situation that has left the country reeling in its aftermath. Programs like the 
house program truly do start to help repair that wreckage. 
Thank you.
