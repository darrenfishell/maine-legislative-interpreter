Testimony of Representative Laurie Osher supporting  
LD 1781, An Act to Establish the Homeless Substance Use Disorder 
Service Program   
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health an d Human Services  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and esteemed members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, I am Laurie Osher and I represent District 25, the majority of Orono. Thank 
you for the opportunity to share my support for LD 1781, An Act to Estab lish the Homeless 
Substance Use Disorder Service Program . Thank you to Representative Drew Gattine for 
bringing this proposal forward.   
 
LD 1781 would continue and expand on a successful pilot project, the Homeless Opioid Users 
Service Engagement (HOUSE) Project. The pilot has served 49 people, connecting them with 
medication -assisted  treatment and medical care, including mental health care.   
 
The pilot has also connected 27 of the participants with housing. This is particularly important, 
because we know  that stable housing plays an important role in peopleâ€™s ability to access and 
follow through with treatment. When an individual is experiencing homelessness, especially 
long-term homelessness, it presents unique challenges to recovery.   
 
The HOUSE Projec t has brought a new approach to providing services, and it has proven it can 
work to help unhoused Mainers who are struggling with substance use disorder. It is exactly the 
kind of innovative approach we need if we are going to save lives, and we simply mu st act: 
Mainers are dying every day. In 2022, we lost almost two people a day, on average, to 
preventable overdoses.  
 
I ask the committee to please support LD 1781. Please feel welcome to contact me with any 
questions you may have for me.
