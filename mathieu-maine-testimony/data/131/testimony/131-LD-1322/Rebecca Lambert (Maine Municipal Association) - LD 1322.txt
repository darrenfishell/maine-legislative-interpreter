In Support of  
LD 1 322 - An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory Committee 
Concerning Remote Participation 
April 10, 2023  
_________________________________________________________________________________ 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, 
and I am providing testimony in support of LD 1 322 on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association’s (MMA) 
elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the 
advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
The pandemic put a halt to all in- person activities when it hit Maine . However , municipalities were 
steadfast in figur ing out a way to continue  providing  services for their citizens while also keeping 
themselves , employees , and volunteers safe. Remote meetings became a tool that allowed business to be 
conducted, meetings to be held , and the public provided a way for their voice s to be heard.  
Of course, as with any change, there were complications at first, but in the last three years 
municipal leaders have embraced this technology  and perfected it  to meet  their needs . Without intention,  
it has eliminated participation barriers for those with work responsibilities, childcare issues, and other 
challenges relating to  participating within their community by being physically present.  
Speaking from  perso nal experience, it’s been very convenient to Zoom in to my town’s selectboard 
meeting and listen to the discussions without having to leave the comfort of my home.  As a member of 
my local RSU school board, I’ve also witnessed the benefit of remote access where citizens can submit 
comments remotely, or board members who may have a childcare issue or are  traveling  for their job, can 
still participate.  
This session, legislators have been afforded the benefit of using remote methods  when necessary 
and as busy as all of our lives are, having this benefit makes sense.  
We could all agree that in -person is the best way to have a discussion, but allowing remote meeting 
access creates a more level playing field for all citizens who wish to  participate but may lack the means or 
ability to do so.   
Thank you for your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
