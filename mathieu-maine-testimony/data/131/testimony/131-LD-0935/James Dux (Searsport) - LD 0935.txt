Dear Honorable Members of the Maine Legislature,  
I wish to voice my opinion and concerns regarding:  
LD 935 An Act to Remove Barriers to Abortion Coverage in Private Insurance . This bill i s requiring the 
eliminati on of  a private  insurance  company’s ability to charge co -insurance  (copays)  or deductibles for 
abortion. Co-insurance (copays) and deductibles are the way private insurers operate. Like these 
payments or not, a state does not have the right to dictate to a private insurer  how they conduct 
business .
