LD 935
Dear Committee Members,
Please Do NOT pass LD 935.  Abortion services should not be exempted from 
copayment, deductibles, or other cost-sharing requirements.  Abortion should not 
have a separate and protected status to make it easier for women to have abortions.  I 
do not believe we have these exemptions for other health services in Maine such as 
cancer treatments and other life-saving medical procedures.  We should NOT make a 
protected class for abortions.  Please do NOT pass LD 935.
Thank you, David Homchuck (Guilford)
