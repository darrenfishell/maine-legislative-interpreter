Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Services, LD 935 - “An Act to Remove Barriers to Abortion Coverage in 
Private Insurance”, May 1, 2023.
Representative Moonen, Representative Arford, Senator Bailey, Representative 
Cluchey, Representative Mastraccio, Representative Mathieson, and Members of the 
Committee:
My name is Katherine Martin. I am testifying in support of LD 935.
I believe this bill is critical for the State of Maine to firmly establish set law in view 
of the Supreme Courts decision that the rights allotted to women regarding their 
health and reproductive decisions be determined by each state’s legislature.
As a citizen of Maine, and of the United States I fully support the state of Maine 
establishing insurance regulation regarding abortion care as a part of health care. 
Family planning needs to be regarded as fundamental health care much like an annual
health screening. 
It is my hope that doing so will protect Maine citizens from the insurance industry 
efforts avoid any cost outlays.
Thank you for this protective piece of legislation. I shall hope it passes.
