Comments for the Health Coverage Insurance Financial Services Committee of the 
Maine Legislature on May 1, 2023
I wish to register opposition to LD 935 - An Act to Remove Barriers to Abortion 
Coverage in Private Insurance.  This bill as I understand it would have the effect of 
eliminating the work arounds that already make a religious or conscience-bound 
employer's exception to abortion funding little more than a protest statement. Is the 
intention to silence the employer's deeply held conscience convictions once and for 
all, so that no one needs even to see them on a form?  I would also include this in a 
category of bills that (perhaps unintended) could create an impression in a patient that
abortion may be preferred by the insurance company over other more complicated or 
expensive responses to unintended pregnancy.
