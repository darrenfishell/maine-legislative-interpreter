Christiain Civic League of Maine 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Maine Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services, I am Mike McClellan, Policy Director for the Christian Civic League of 
Maine. The Christian Civic League of Maine envisions a state and nation where God is honored, religious 
freedom ﬂourishes, families thrive, and life is cherished. We believe a Biblical approach works in life and 
including in governance. 
l am here to testify in opposition to LD 935 An Act to Remove Barriers to Abortion Coverage in Private 
Insurance - Rep. Matt Moonen of Portland 
This bill prohibits a health plan with an effective date on or after January 1, 2024, from imposing any 
deductible, copayment, coinsurance, or other cost~sharing requirements for the costs of abortion 
services. Right off you have to wonder if Maine citizens who suffer from Diabetes, Cancer or other 
afflictions that can become costly wonder how abortion became so favored? 
This bill would appear to be another in the line-up of legislation looking to make Maine a destination for 
abortions. lt would ban insurers from charging any co-pays or other out-of-pocket costs related to 
abortion, making it an even easier, cheaper, and more accessible option for young moms——perpetuating 
the lie that aborting a baby is ”no big deal." How strange that as we discuss aborting a healthy baby, you 
can imagine a Public Hearing in another room in this building discussing how we can cause young people 
to come to Maine given our declining numbers of youth. 
Maine is one of only seven states that requires all private insurance plans to cover abortions--driving all 
insurers that may have religious or philosophical objections out of the market. With this legislation, 
Maine would become even more of an outlier, joining California, New York, Oregon, Illinois, and 
Maryland as the 6th state to ban any out-of-pocket costs for abortion. Please oppose LD 935. 
Thank you for your time and consideration today. 
Know that many are hopeful of your actions and are praying for you and your families. God bless.
