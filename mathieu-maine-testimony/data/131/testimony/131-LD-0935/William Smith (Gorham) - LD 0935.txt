Bill Smith
In Opposition of L.D. 935 "An Act to Remove Barriers to Abortion Coverage in 
Private Insurance"
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Distinguished Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services, my 
name is Bill Smith and I live in Gorham. Thank you for the opportunity to testify in 
opposition of LD 935.
I am opposed to mandating a healthcare provider remove any and all financial 
responsibility for any services or coverages they provide. 
I ask you members of the Committee to vote OUGHT NOT PASS for LD 935. 
Thank you.
