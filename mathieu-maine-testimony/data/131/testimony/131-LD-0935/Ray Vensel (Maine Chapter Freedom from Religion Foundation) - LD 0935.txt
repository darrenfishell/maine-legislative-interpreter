LD 935 
 
Members of the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services, this is 
testimony IN FAVOR OF LD 935.  
LD 935 directly supports Maine residentsâ€™ right to a legal abortion by prohibiting coverage that 
is different from other provisions of health insurance. This bill would prevent an insurance 
carrier from effectively penalizing a patient for having an abortion by requiring additional 
payments not required for prenatal care or other services.   
The fact that a carrier could do such a thing under current law is not acceptable. The needs of 
reproductive health demand that there be no barriers to the performance of lawful reproductive 
health measures.  
Please protect Maine public health, and pass this bill. Thank you.
