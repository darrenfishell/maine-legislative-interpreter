This bill has several problems.  It appears that it makes communications among 
providers - midwife and other health care providers more difficult, results in more 
costs for patients, it would apply hospital protocols to home births unnecessarily.  In 
addition the current law that was passed in 2016 seems to be working.  This bill is not 
necessary and does not make improvements over the previous law.
