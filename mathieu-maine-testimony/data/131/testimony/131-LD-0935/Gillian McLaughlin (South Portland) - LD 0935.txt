LD 935
My name is Gillian McLaughlin, I’m from South Portland, and I am testifying in 
support of LD 935. At age 28 I found out that, because of a birth defect in my uterus, 
I am able to get pregnant but am not able to carry a baby to term. Therefore if I were 
to get pregnant, I would need an abortion for my own health. I’m 32 now. It’s difficult
to sit in a living room passing around copies of my friends’ ultrasounds, knowing I 
can never be in that position, knowing I can never birth my own child. It would be 
exponentially harder if I were to get pregnant and not be able to immediately secure a 
safe, affordable abortion. No birth control is 100% effective. Without safe, affordable 
access to abortion, women like me are put in unnecessarily risky situations. I have 
private health insurance with a high deductible and an abortion would be hard for me 
financially. LD 935, by removing cost sharing in insurance coverage of abortion, is 
crucial for people who will otherwise struggle to afford their abortions. I ask you to 
support LD 935. Thank You.
