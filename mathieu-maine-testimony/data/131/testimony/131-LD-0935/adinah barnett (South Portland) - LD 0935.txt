Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee,
I am submitting written testimony on LD 935 (An Act to Remove Barriers to 
Comprehensive Pregnancy Care in Private Insurance).
I am a mother and grandmother living in Southern Maine. I support LD 935 because I 
want to be sure that everyone who wants an abortion has affordable, safe access to 
those services. 
All people should be able to afford an abortion regardless of their insurance status. 
Whether privately insured, or not insured at all, everyone should have affordable 
access to this extremely important healthcare.
I urge you to vote YES on LD 935.
Thank you,
