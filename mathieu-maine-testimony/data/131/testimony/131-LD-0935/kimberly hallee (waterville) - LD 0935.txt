LD 935
I support LD 935  An Act to Remove  Barriers to Abortion Coverage in Private 
Insurance. I am a Registered Nurse, hold a va1id ME RN License and provided 43 
years of nursing service to the Kennebec Valley Region. Quality healthcare including 
health education, insurance coverage and comprehensive follow through and 
follow-up for all care rendered should be   IMHO the right and privilege of ALL 
MAINE CITIZENS. Certainly, the folks who can afford and hold private insurance 
should have access to reproductive health care  including  all abortion coverage as 
determined  and agreed upon by their medical team and themselves. 
Thank you. Kimberly Hallee 12 Gray Street Waterville ME 04901
