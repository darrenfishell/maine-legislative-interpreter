In November of 2021 a sweet young woman who I cared about took her life by 
jumping from the Penobscot Narrows Bridge. I was so saddened by this. Her mom is 
a dear friend and its unfathomable the pain she must carry daily. This is a well-known
bridge for suicides and suicide attempts. Had there been a barrier fence in place she 
may not have even been there that day, or at least a barrier fence might have stalled 
her and bought time for her to change her mind, or time for a passerby to notice, stop 
and try to help. There have been 12 suicides as well as suspected suicides and 
attempts. With the decline of mental health in the community and growing number of 
suicides from the bridge, having no barrier fences on the bridge is irresponsible. I 
think it is sad that money is in the way of saving lives.  Put the fences up. It's the right
thing to do.
