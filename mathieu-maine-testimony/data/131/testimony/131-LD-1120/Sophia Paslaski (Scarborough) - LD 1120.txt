Senator Chipman, Representative “Williams, and Members of the Committeeiimy name is Sophia Y,A 
Pas_lask _i,‘ar|'d l ama friendof Linda’ Normanan_d -a Childhood jfriencl ofher late daughter, _Siri Norman, 5- ,_ 
who died jumping from the. Penobscot Narrows Bridge. I 
amhere today to speal<j.in~_suppo_rt of this bi|_l.<f 
_On _ its webs'ite,'the Maine Department of Transportation calls the Penobscot Narrows Bridge the '”crown 
jewelj of coastal Maine."'1 _ i 
But "uneasy liesfthie head that wears§th ‘e _ crown," as they say,Iwhen at least§'1t1i; 
people ih,ave-jumped to their deaths from that crown jewel since it ope_ne.d _in 2006.23"-5-5' I 
say ’-‘at least” 
because Ythe true; number is likely higher; according to the Bangor Daily News, the Maine DOT -doesnot 
keep tr _ack of'suicides.on.the bridge? All of these deaths were prievlentnabl le, but Mainetchose not to4
i 
prevent them by repeatedly neglecting to install life-saving sjuicideprevention barriers; ” 1I 
Thesetbarriers work. VA stu _clyrconduct ’ed_ in_2005 — the year~the_ Penobscot~ Narrows Bridge opened# V _ 
riouhd that suicide prevention barriers onvtheili/lemorial Bridge §iIn7/Xugusta were hiighlyleffective? Not? , 1 
one person, has _lost‘th‘eir life to;su_i_<;ide onthe Memorial Bridge since barriers were ins'talledin;1983.7' 
Those whoiareiprevented fromjumping are not likely to ‘die by suicide fi_n.ot_her;ways.7 f; if V‘-5»: 
These-barrier_s_are also wellwithin our meansas a stat_ e. _ TheFiscal lmpact,Statement forthis bill says 
that instalwlatiojnl and maintenancieof; suicide barrier_s1o'ri_the Penobscotg Narrows Bridge will reqiuirei a 
one-timeallocation.of_$2 million" from'the,Highway Fund.“ 'F_or__context,' Highway Fund allocations for .4 ._ 
fiscal year 2022 totaled__ $34B,983,256.9 ’Th _esuici_de barrier allocationiis just 0.57%, of that amount. 
Previous members of this Committee Ideemed this]measure too costly and nixed the installation ofY 
suicide barriers in thaticould havejprevented Siri's deathin l ask this Colmm;ittee to right that 
wrong nc_>_w_ and recognize that suicide prevention barriers are a vital'inve_s_tment for -Mainers in crisis. 
We can spare 0.57% of all Highway Fund allocations fora, proven, life-saving pjroject that will makei 
coastal Maine's "crownjewe|" worthyofits royalstatus agai_n. __; _ _’ ' '
