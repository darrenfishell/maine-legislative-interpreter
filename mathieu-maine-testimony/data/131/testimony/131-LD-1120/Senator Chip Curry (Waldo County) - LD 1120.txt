Testimony of Senator Chip Curry introducing  
LD 1120, “Resolve, to Install a Suicide Barrier on the Penobscot Narrows Bridge”  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation  
April 4, 2023  
 
 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished colleagues of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, I am Senator Chip Curry, and I represent the 26 rural, coastal, and island 
communities of Waldo County. Today I present to you LD 1120, “Resolve, to Install a Suicide Barrier 
on the Penobscot Na rrows Bridge.”  
 
The Penobscot Narrows Bridge, which connects Verona Island and the Town of Prospect, has been the 
site of numerous deaths by suicide since it opened in 20061, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. I believe we must act swiftly 
to prevent further predicta ble tragedies from occurring at this bridge. This resolve directs the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) to construct and maintain barriers on the bridge for the purpose 
of suicide prevention and requires the department to report on its progress every six months until the 
installation of the barrier is complete.  
 
The Penobscot Narrows Bridge is a marvel of engineering, a symbol of our state's progress, and a vital 
connection between communities. However, its height of 447 feet and the lack of effective safe ty 
barriers have made it a dangerous location for those struggling with suicidal ideations14. The 
emergency phones installed on the bridge have proven insufficient in addressing this issue, with some 
past instances of non -functionality and limited effectiv eness2, 4. 
 
Countless studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of barrier fencing in preventing suicides. A 
fundamental aspect of why these barriers work is their ability to create a crucial delay, allowing time 
for individuals experiencing suicidal tho ughts to reconsider their actions and for others to intervene10. 
I wish to repeat that. A key factor in preventing death from suicide is to create a distance in time from 
the suicidal thought to the lethal action. In the case of the Penobscot Narrows Bridg e, we have failed 
to design for the delay between the thought and the lethal action.  
 
Research has consistently shown that barriers are more effective than alternative methods, such as 
signage or telephone hotlines, in reducing suicide rates at bridges and  other high -risk locations11. In 
fact, one notable study out of Switzerland revealed that the implementation of barriers led to a 
significant 86% reduction in suicides at publicly accessible height s12.

Chip.Curry@legislature.maine.gov  * legislature.maine.gov/senate  Moreover, it has been found that individuals who are prevented from employing one method of suicide 
generally do not seek alternative means. That same  Swiss study , discovered that after being deterred 
by a barrier, a majority of individuals would not choose another place to jump from12. 
 
We’ve already seen p roof of these barriers working h ere in Maine. F ollowing a rise in suicides at 
Augusta's Memorial Bridge, a barrier was installed to halt these tragic deaths. No suicides have been 
reported at the Memorial Bridge since. A 2005 study revealed that not only was the barrier effective in 
preventing suicides, but there was also no observable increase in attempts at other sites across the state 
during the research period. As a result, the barrier continues to serve as a successful measure in 
deterring suicide dea ths13. 
 
In past legislatures, there have been numerous attempts to build a barrier on the Penobscot Narrows 
Bridge. Tragically, none have been successful due to a few concerns I’d like to address.  
 
It is true that there will be an initial financial investm ent required to implement such a barrier, but the 
long-term benefits of saving lives and preventing the emotional impact on friends, families, and 
communities far outweigh the upfront costs. Moreover, certain studies have shown that the costs of 
implementi ng suicide prevention barriers are often offset by the resulting decrease in expenses related 
to emergency response, health care, and economic productivity loss15. Investing in a suicide barrier is 
not only a moral imperative but also a fiscally responsibl e decision.  
 
I have had conversations with DOT representatives to better understand what prevention measures they 
have taken and are currently working on. While it is commendable that the department is taking action, 
the evidence cited in this testimony st rongly suggests that barriers are the most effective means of 
suicide prevention at high -risk locations like the Penobscot Narrows Bridge.  
  
We do not need to “own” every tragedy that occurs in our state. But in this case, we do literally own 
it. We designed the bridge and built it. We constructed the railing for the safety of cars but ignored the 
risks to people experiencing the temporary and often fleeting thoughts of ending their lives. Now that 
we know that it has become a suicide hotspot, we have  a duty to act. In the same way, if we discovered 
1 to 2 fatalities a year occurred at the same intersection, or the same 650 -yard stretch of road, we would 
be compelled to act.   
 
Installing a barrier on the Penobscot Narrows Bridge would be a well -support ed, evidence -based 
approach to protecting the lives of our community members and reducing the number of suicides. By 
taking this action, we are demonstrating our commitment to the safety and well -being of Mainers.  I 
urge you to join me and my cosponsors, w hich include all of the elected legislators that border this 
bridge, and support this life -saving legislation.   
 
In closing, I’d like to recognize these are very hard discussions and I want to remind folks, both in the 
room and watching via livestream, t hat there is help if you are considering suicide. Please reach out. 
You can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 to connect with a trained crisis 
counselor.
