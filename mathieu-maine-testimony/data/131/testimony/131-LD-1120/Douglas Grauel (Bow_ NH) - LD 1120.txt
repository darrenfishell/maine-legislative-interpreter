LD 1120
I ask that you vote in favor of LD 1120 (SP 454) to construct suicide barriers on the 
Penobscot Narrows Bridge. This action will signify a sincere commitment by the 
State of Maine to preventing suicide and supporting citizens with mental health 
challenges.  Too many people have lost their lives at this bridge; too many of us have 
known these people and now view this bridge as a place of unfathomable heartache 
and loss.  Putting up preventive barriers is the reasonable, compassionate step to take 
to value and protect future lives and maintain this bridge and its observatory as a 
scenic destination rather than a suicide opportunity.
