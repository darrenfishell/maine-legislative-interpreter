LD 1102
I am writing in opposition to LD1102.  It seeks to allow recall of a School Board 
Member with no stated cause, and with very low numbers required for petitions and 
the recall election itself.   There is no requirement that a recall be initiated by a town 
or school district resident, and sets a very low bar for a very serious process to be 
used at whim against any school board member.     Those seeking to undermine the 
good work of our school boards and the important job of public education would have
a field day  wielding this  process willy-nilly .  Please do not push it forward. 
Thank you for your consideration.
