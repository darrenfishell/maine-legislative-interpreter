LD 1102
Good morning,
I oppose LD 1102.  This bill would allow recall of any school board member at any 
time for any reason as long as a petition for recall equal to at least 10% of the votes 
cast in the last gubernatorial election.  
There are already specific School Board policy measures in place including Code of 
Ethics, Violations procedures and ultimately, the ballot box.  
School Boards are designed to be nonpartisan.  Let's keep them that way.
