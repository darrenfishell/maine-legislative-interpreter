As one that speaks at different school board meetings throughout Maine and one that 
has consistent contact with concerned parents & citizens; please allow me to state 
how desperately this is needed to pass. I've seen many outrageous and vile school 
board members that have stepped out of line only to be slapped on the hand with no 
real punishment or threats of being removed from the board. Especially when there 
isn't even a policy to do so. 
After I spoke in Windham, ME I actually received an "anonymous" email from one of
the school board members which is against the rules. But these school board members
do what they want, think, feel or are told to do at will because there are no threats to 
them being removed or disciplined. 
This is all part of a much greater plan. These boards are allowed to further the 
lgbTQia TransQueer Gender Rainbow Cult agenda without fear of being removed. I 
can call it a cult bc I spent 30+ years as a member & advocate of the lgbTQia 
TransQueer Gender Cult, not to mention I was a transgender "woman" for more than 
20 of those years. 
I know it is a cult. I know it is targeting the youth. I know it has enveloped the public 
government school system. I know it is hellbent on making sure explicit materials are 
available to children to desensitize them & prepare them for grooming, victimization 
and sexualization. These school board members that are promoting & pushing this 
agenda MUST have consequences when they are challenged. Thank  You
