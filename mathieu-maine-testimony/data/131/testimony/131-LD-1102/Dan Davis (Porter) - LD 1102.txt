LD 1102
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the State and Local 
Government Committee,
I represent no entity or agency other than myself, and write to testify in support of 
LD1102.
The extended pandemic isolation measures we all experienced was a practice, and an 
unfortunate catalyst that fostered an increasing contempt for democracy, transparency,
and accountability at the local level of governance, by giving officials an experience, 
however temporary, of unilateral authority. 
This side effect has threatened civil liberties and is an affront to healthy civil 
discourse, diversity of ideas, civic participation, and succession.
I urge the Committee to vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD1102, as it is a common-sense 
and reasonable piece of legislation that restores accountability at the local level and 
reduces the distance between the citizenry and their government.
Thank you,
Dan
