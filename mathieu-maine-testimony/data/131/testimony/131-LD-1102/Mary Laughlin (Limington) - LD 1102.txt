Re:  LD 1102 An Act to Authorize a Recall Election for a School Board Member
Dear Members of the Committee,
My name is Mary Laughlin and I live in Limington.   I am writing against LD 1102. 
This bill offers no criteria to justify the recall of a school board member and in fact, 
the summary section of the bill says that a school board member may be recalled for 
“any reason.”  
Such a prospect would dissuade candidates from running for school board because 
they would know their recall could be capricious and prejudiced.  
The bill seems designed to jeopardize stable school board membership, and without 
stable school boards we will not have good governance of our public schools.    Maine
public schools deserve laws that promote their protection and excellence, and school 
board members deserve the same.
Please vote “ought not to pass.”
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Mary Laughlin
