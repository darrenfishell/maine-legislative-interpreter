Janice Vance
Kennebunk
LD 1102
Good morning, Senator Nangle, Rep. Stover, and members of the Committee on State
and Local Government.  My name is Janice Vance and I am a resident of Kennebunk. 
I am unable to attend today’s public hearing due to a work conflict. I wanted to weigh
in as being opposed to LD 1102. Allowing a school board member to be recalled 
without giving any reason whatsoever opens the flood gates to anyone who wants to 
indulge in baseless character assassination, and on a Town’s dime, no less. In our 
town two school board members were victimized by a recall petition last year. The 
petition was ultimately unsuccessful because it was unwarranted and didn’t get 
enough votes. Still, it took 420 hours of Town staff time to certify the petition, and 
resulted in a lawsuit that ended up being paid by taxpayers.  LD 1102 doesn’t even 
contain a provision for a Town to enact its own recall procedure, allowing abuse 
statewide. This bill is a recipe for disaster, and I ask you to not advance it. Thank you 
for your consideration.
