LD 1102
Senator Nagle, Representative Stover, and esteemed members of the State and Local 
Government Committee My name is Cory Reynolds and I am submitting testimony 
today in Opposition to LD- 1102, An Act to Authorize a Recall Election for a School 
Board Member.
Recently, there was an incident at a RSU 14 School Board meeting where a school 
board member walked across the stage and flipped off one of the concernd parents. it 
was unprofessional and an embarrassment to the community. As a School Board 
Member you think you would be smart and put on a better example for the young 
children, but instead they do this. This isnâ€™t teaching our young students good 
behavior. with that said I urge you to vote Ought Not To Pass on LD-1102. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
