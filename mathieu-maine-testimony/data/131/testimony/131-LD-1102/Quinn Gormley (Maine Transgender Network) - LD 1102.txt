Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and laudable members of the Committee on State and 
Local Government: My name is Quinn Gormley, l use she/her pronouns, and I serve as 
Executive Director of the Maine Transgender Network. l am here today representing 
MaineTransNet and OUT Maine, GLAD, and EquaiityMaine to testify in opposition to LD 1102 
and LD 1181, and Neither for nor Against LD 1443. 
Maine has a long tradition of emphasizing local control of our schools, and among the highest 
election participation rates in the United States.‘ Mainers care about their government, and we 
take our civic responsibilities seriously. Allowing for recall elections of municipal ofﬁcials for any 
reason runs counter to the health of our democracy. Our elections represent the will of our 
voters for the direction and shape of local and state policy. Elected officials at any level should 
not be subject to recall because they are working to implement the will of those voters. Recall 
elections, in this way, represent a chaotic work around our democratic process. 
As organizations representing LGBTQ+ Mainers, we are especially concerned about the use of 
recall elections to target minority school board members. Of the three openly transgender 
people elected to office so far in Maine, all were elected to school boards, and none were able 
to complete their terms. All have faced attempts at recall elections, or call for their resignation 
following attempts to implement policies to ensure the safety and education of all students or 
COVID-19 related policies? 3 Additionally, two out gay school board members, who were both

sen/ing in the same district, recently faced attempts to remove them from their elected seats, 
one through a very contentious recall effort‘ , which included a ruling from a County Superior 
Court Judge, and the other because he became homeless during his tenure and was suddenly 
dropped from the voting roles? While both survived the ugly attempts to remove them from their 
seats, they both decided not to run for additional terms. 
These recall attempts were initiated in response to disagreements over policy. Such 
disagreements are fair, but we already have systems for dealing with them: public comment and 
regular elections. To allow policy disagreement as grounds for recall invites chaos into our 
already burdened local government and public education systems. It would be destabilizing to 
our local governments, including crucial institutions like public schools, whenever a group of 
voters - whatever their political persuasion or policy interests - can seek a recall to do an end 
run around a policy issue supported or opposed by a particular official. As such, we must 
oppose LDs 1102 and 1181. 
That said, we feel that local school systems deserve a standardized system for the conduct of 
recall elections, and though we oppose the use of recall elections over policy disagreements, 
we allow that there may be other conduct by school board members that would justify the need 
for a recall system. We believe that LD 1443 is a step in the right direction for the creation of 
such a system. However, we are concerned that the section defining the grounds for recall is 
vague and may allow for misuse. We believe there may be other legal issues related to the 
validity of vacancies resulting from successful recall elections and we urge the committee to 
carefully investigate these issues with experts before supporting the bill. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, 
Quinn Gormley
