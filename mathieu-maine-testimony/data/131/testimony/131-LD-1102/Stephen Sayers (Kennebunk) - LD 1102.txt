Stephen Sayers
Kennebunk
LD 1102
To: Senator Nangle, Rep. Stover, and Honorable Members of the Committee on State 
and Local Government: my name is Stephen Sayers and I wish to speak IN 
OPPOSITION TO LD 1102. I am a resident of Kennebunk. This proposed legislation 
has one large hole, but you could drive a Peterbilt through that hole, with room to 
spare. There are no grounds specified, or even alluded to, for a legally justifiable 
recall election. The bill is consumed with the procedures applicable to the recall 
election process, but is stonily silent on what conduct or misconduct would justify 
such a recall in the first place. Furthermore, this proposed statute would apply 
exclusively to school board members, and would prevent municipal charters from 
excluding school board members from their scope, as has been done in in a number of
towns across Maine. If this legislation were to pass, school board members could no 
longer be excluded from the definition of "municipal officials" subject to recall. 
Instead, they would be lumped together with all other municipal officials, and treated 
identically for recall purposes. This would fundamentally undercut the longstanding 
and well-recognized difference between school board members and other municipal 
officials, and would result in school boards being dragged into the hurly-burly of local
politics when the law tries to elevate them above that fray. In my submission, this bill 
is markedly, and obviously, inferior to LD 1443, and it should not be adopted.
