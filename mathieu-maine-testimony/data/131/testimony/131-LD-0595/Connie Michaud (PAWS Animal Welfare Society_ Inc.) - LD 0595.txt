My name is Connie Michaud and I live in Saint John Plantation in Aroostook County.
We have a small population up here but it is a population that very much needs Help 
Fix ME vouchers. The program has helped us to control the cat population up here.   
We do not have large spay/neuter events so people need to be able to contact Help Fix
ME to get individual vouchers.
Help Fix ME works very well for us when people can actually get vouchersâ€”which 
for the last several years has been very problematic.
The proposed rules do nothing to help our area except make it less likely our couple 
of vets would want to deal with the reports and paperwork involved. 
Thank you for taking my testimony.
