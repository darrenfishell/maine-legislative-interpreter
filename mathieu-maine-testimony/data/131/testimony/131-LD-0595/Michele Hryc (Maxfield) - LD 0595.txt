The Animal Welfare Program has failed to uphold the mandate given under LD 1898 
by not contracting out administration of the Help Fix Me spay/neuter program.  
Rather they have proposed changes to the overall structure and design of the program 
that will make it harder to access.  
I have worked with many low-income and disabled people who benefit from the 
companionship of their pets.  The HFM program has enabled them to demonstrate 
responsible companion care by having their pet spayed/neutered.  Low-income and 
disabled folks already have many barriers to overcome.  AWP's proposed changes 
will only increase to those barriers.
I have also been personally involved in animal rescue for the past 40 years.  I have 
come across many dogs and cats who are abandoned in my woods nearby and I know 
that there are many more of them who die of the elements, wildlife, and disease.  
Most had never been spayed/neutered. Oftentimes, people adopt an animal into their 
lives only to get rid of the animal or the animal's offspring because it is easier than 
paying a vet to have them spayed or neutered due to high cost. When I operated a 
rescue in northern Aroostook County, our limited funds often dictated the necessity of
euthanizing otherwise healthy animals because we didn't have enough 
room/resources.  This occurs on an even larger-scaled basis in the more established 
humane society shelters across the state.  The HFM program does offer the 
opportunity to reduce these occurrences by decreasing the number of unwanted 
animals.
I strongly encourage the Committee to thoroughly review the proposed changes made 
by the AWP and to keep in mind the great benefit the HFM program is to people and 
animals alike.
