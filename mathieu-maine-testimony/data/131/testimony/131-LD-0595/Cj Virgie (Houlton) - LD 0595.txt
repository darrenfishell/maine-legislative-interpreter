LD 595
My name is CJ Virgie. I am from Hodgdon and I am the manager of the Houlton 
Humane Society.
I favor LD 595 to make these new Help Fix ME rules major/substantive.  The rules 
we work with now are relatively simple, and those of us who have been working with 
them the most understand them fully. We don’t need new convoluted rules that just 
make more paperwork for everyone—the vets and the new administrator.  Just add on 
some rules to make sure the new administrator adheres to the law— don’t make a new
program or make the program harder to administer.
What is important is that we work to get more vets to take the vouchers, we pay the 
vets on time and we process voucher requests quickly. I host significant events 
frequently, but in between clinics, there are many times that individuals need 
vouchers.  We need to make sure that option remains the same.
