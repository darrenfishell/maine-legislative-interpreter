My name is Dr. Jessica Matulis.  I am the veterinarian on the Animal Welfare Advisory 
Council, and am writing in opposition of LD595.  As a veterinarian who has performed Help 
Fix Me spays and neuters weekly for the past 5 years, I understand the frustration with the 
disbursement of vouchers/funds within the Help Fix Me Program.  The biggest challenges I 
have experienced are either the clients cannot use the vouchers in time (they cannot find a 
veterinarian to take the voucher and the vouchers have expired) or funds are not available to 
reimburse the veterinarian for the services already provided (since the funds for the program 
are not consistently available throughout the year).
The Animal Welfare Department has recently made modifications to the rules in order to 
ensure veterinarians are being paid for their services in a timely and more consistent manner.
These new changes will make the entire process easier for those directly involved in Help Fix 
Me, the veterinarian and the client.  LD595 would delay the movement of the program to a 
third party, and ultimately delay services that can be provided by the veterinarian through the 
program.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
