To whom it may concern, 
In order to support animal welfare in the state of Maine I have been working with the Cat Coalition of 
Western Maine for over 3 years. The work that they have done to help control the population of cats in 
Maine has been irreplaceable. There are not many resources to help people with their abilities, most 
local shelters are overwhelmed with numbers of animals and don't offer the same flexibility or support 
as this organization does. 
As a veterinarian I have seen the costs increasing for routine surgeries and a lot of people are turning to 
options for lower cost spay/neuter programs. There has become more of a financial limitation to animal 
ownership, that I feel opens up the need to continue these programs even more so now. The Help Fix 
Me program has enabled CCOWIVI with the support of veterinarians to provide a valuable sewlce to 
people and animals. l feel my time spent contributing to this cause has been very gratifying, and has 
however small, eased some burden from the veterinary profession and bridged some gap in affordable 
care for animals. 
There are limitations to continuing clinics mainly in the form of expenses in both supplies, time, and 
professional skills. A tremendous amount of effort and compassion goes into clinic by the CCOWM 
group and all involved. To be paid consistently, fairly, and timely are a large part of this and continuing 
veterinary involvement. I hope to help support the important work this and other groups do for animal 
welfare in Maine.
