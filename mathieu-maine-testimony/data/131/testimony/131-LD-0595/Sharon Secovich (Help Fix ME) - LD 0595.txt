RE: Administration of the Help Fix ME program 
Dear Commissioner Beal: 
On behalf of the Maine Federation of Humane Societies, Spay Maine, Marian’s Dream, Animal Refuge 
League of Greater Portland, Animal Welfare Society, Greater Androscoggin Humane Society, Houlton 
Humane Society, Kennebec Valley Humane Society, PAWS Animal Welfare Society Fort Kent, Pope 
Memorial Humane Society, and Cat Coalition of Western Maine we are writing to request the 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry ("Department") utilize the option to contract for 
the administration of the Help Fix ME (”HFM") program pursuant to Z_iy§_§A 1:33910—8 sub-§1—A. Doing so 
will provide an opportunity to better serve HFM’s constituency and allow more of the Animal Welfare 
Program's ("AWP") resources to be utilized for their many other essential responsibilities in their work to 
ensure the humane and proper treatment of animals. 
We are very fortunate to have the HFM program, which was established through a collaborative effort in 
2004 to provide low-cost spay/neuter and rabies vaccination services for Maine's low-income pet 
owners. Providing assistance to impoverished households with pets helps our people, animals, and 
communities. in addition to saving animals’ lives and reducing shelter populations, it lifts up Maine's 
families living with pets in poverty, increasing their access to services, resources, information and 
support. Accordingly, it is essential for HFM to be run as efficiently and effectively as possible. 
The ongoing and high demand for HFM services was recognized by the legislature in 2017 when more 
funding from the petfood surcharge was directed to the program? However, despite the continued need 
and those additional resources, the number of spay/neuter surgeries has decreased rather than 
increased?

No. Spay/Neuters 2968 2778 1976 3569 1346 1558 
Additionally, despite there being a surplus of funds in the HFM account -— a recent estimated balance was 
$400,0003 — the program has been unavailable to the public for over two months with the AWP posting 
1 See ZQQRSA §7lé, sub-Q4. 
Z See Animal Welfare Program Annual Reports for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 & 2019. 
3 Director Hughes provided this figure during a stakeholder call held on August 24, 2020.
an update on October 2, 2020 that ”We are currently not giving out applications at this time and do not 
have a date for when they will become available." “ We recognize the HFM account balance figure does 
not reflect the vouchers which have not yet been returned for payment, but there are not $400,000 
worth of outstanding vouchers in circulation and closures of the program are not uncommon. 
It was acknowledged in 2007, just a few years after HFM's inception, that contracting out the 
administration of the program may be in the best interest for all involved. Accordingly, the statute was 
amendeds to expressly authorize the Department to do so and a corresponding rule change“ followed. 
This was the result of realizing the day-to-day management and promotion of the program is quite 
tedious, labor-intensive, and time sensitive. it requires painstaking tracking, significant follow-up with 
clients who may have difficulty with the application/voucher process or face other hurdles, quick turn- 
around to prevent unwanted litters, frequent outreach to and dialogue with the veterinary community, 
prompt payments to service providers, and more. 
While the AWP has made changes over the years to adapt and improve the way in which the program is 
operated internally, it remains constrained by the limitations of working within the state government 
financial processes and balancing the demands of its many important responsibilities. Fortunately, over 
the years, several organizations have specialized in low—cost spay/neuter around the state. Havinga 
distinct focus on such work, less red tape to contend with, and more capacity to address the many facets 
of running these programs make them ideal candidates to be considered for administering HFM. It is not 
at all uncommon for the state to utilize outside resources with specialized knowledge, skills, and 
infrastructure in a field to assist it with effectively carrying out its statutory obligations and mission. 
The current need for HFM services is overwhelming as the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a complete 
suspension of spay/neuter surgeries for at least three months earlier this year, access remains limited, 
and more Mainers are facing economic hardship. And with Governor Mills continuing to extend the State 
of Civil Emergency it is important the funds remain protected for their intended purpose. Should they 
continue to sit in the account unused, they could be vulnerable to being redirected pursuant to 
emergency powers to cover shortfalls caused by the pandemic. 
For all the foregoing reasons, now is the time to pursue the option of contracting out the administration 
of HFM to a qualified entity through the competitive process. This is an opportunity to improve upon the 
vital and life-saving work of both HFM and the AWP. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. We would welcome the opportunity to speak further with 
you to discuss our request.

Testimony of Sharon Secovich in Support of LD 595 
"An Act to Require Major Substantive Rulemaking for the Companion Animal Sterilization Fund" 
Help Fix ME (HFM), Maine's low-income, low-cost, cat/dog spay/neuter program has funded surgeries since 
2004. lt is ﬁnanced entirely by cat and dog owners; tax money does not support this program. As money into the 
program increased (thanks to efforts by animal welfare advocates [ADOPT license plate, tax check-off box, direct 
donations]), the Animal Welfare Program (AWP) struggled to effectively run HFM. Problems include taking 
weeks to months to issue vouchers, not returning calls to clients seeking vouchers, not paying veterinarians ina 
timely manner, not spending the money (there was a $546,700 cash balance in the fund in April [kitten season] 
2021) and shutting down the phone lines. 
in 2022, as a result of continuing problems with the administration of the program, this committee heard 
testimony from stakeholders and voted unanimously to pass LD 1828 - “An Act Requiring a Contract for the 
Administration of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Low-Cost Spaying and 
Neutering Program" . At that time, the Committee required the AWP outsource the administration of HFM toa 
"suitable animal welfare organization." The resultant law reads: 
Sec. 2. 7 MRSA §39l0-B, sui:i~§i-A, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 539, Pt. CCCC, 
§2, is amended to read: 
I-A. Administration of the fund. Hie 
commissioner may §_l)g_l_l contract the administration of the fund to a suitable animal welfare 
organization seiccted through a competitive process. The contracting 
organization shall administer the fund in accordance with procedures and 
eligibiiity standards established under subsection 2. The contracting organization er 
may not expend more than i5% of the fund annually for administrative costs. 
In the event that the commissioner cannot ﬁnd a suitable animal welfare organization, the 
department shall administer the fund. 
The Committee required the AWP issue a request for proposals (RFP) to administer HFM" . . . in accordance with 
the procedures and eligibility standards established under subsection 2" , no later than August 1, 2022. lt is now 
February 2023, and it has not issued the RFP. Instead, the AWP proposed changes to the program that required 
rulemaking and ensures no outside animal welfare organization will be qualified or want to bid on the program. 
Thus, guaranteeing the program will remain with the Department. 
The AWP's proposed redesign of HFM is a blatant disregard of the legislature's intent to outsource it when it 
passed LD-1828. The AWP's proposed changes are "major and substantive" and should be reviewed by this 
Committee. These changes include (but are not limited to): 
Program Administration 
1. Requiring the organization that administers the program have "experience managing programs of similar 
funding on a state-wide basis" AND the organization that administers the program cannot actually 
participate in the program. Meaning, that organization cannot accept vouchers to spay/neuter cats/dogs. 
These two requirements ensure that every animal welfare organization in Maine will not be eligible to
2 
administer this program and every veterinarian clinic would not want to administer the program; only the 
state AWP would be eligible to administer the program. 
Veterinagy Participation 
2. Requiring veterinarians, fill out an application requesting funding and committing to a specific number of 
surgeries over a 12 month period and pre-paying the veterinarians for those vouchers. 
— Pre-paying veterinarians will tie up money for a 12-month period and may, or not be spent by the 
veterinarian. This money could be used assisting individual pet owners seeking a voucher. 
~ Pre-paying veterinarians and requiring they commit a specific number of surgeries will only benefit the 
handful of veterinarians in Maine that conduct ”Spay/Neuter Events" as described in the Definitions, 
and/or those who operate out of an animal shelter. Creating a spay/neuter “desert” throughout most of 
the state. Individuals will not have access to the HFM program unless they live near one of these clinics 
or events. 
— Prepaying veterinarians will cause veterinarians who may only want to perform a few low-cost s/n 
surgeries or who may only want to help an existing client to opt out of the program. 
l agree that veterinarians should receive enough vouchers to conduct spay/neuter events. The Department 
stated in its announcement for rulemaking that it is going through this rule making process in part, to 
”account for the current shortage of veterinary professionals in the state by specifically including large scale 
spay/neuter events . . ." The Department is already providing veterinarians with large numbers of vouchers 
”specifically for large scale spay/ neuter events" while ggg issuing vouchers to individual clients who call the 
HFM phone line seeking help. So why do we need rulemaking for this? 
3. When this program was created, two of the requirements from the veterinarian community was that they 
have very little paperwork, and they not collect the co-pay. The AWP's proposed rules requires the 
Administrator to report quarterly to the Department making it necessary for the veterinarians to report 
quarterly to the Administrator. This along with the application requirements, create more, not less 
paperwork for the veterinarians. 
The intent of LD 1828 is that the funds were to be transferred to the new administrator on a periodic basis to 
administer the program, issue vouchers, and pay veterinarians. The Department's changes to LD 1828 are 
“major and substantive" and should be reviewed by this Committee.
