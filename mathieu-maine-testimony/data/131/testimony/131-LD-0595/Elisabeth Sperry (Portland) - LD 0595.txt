To Whom It May Concern,
My name is Dr. Elisabeth Sperry and I am a co-owner of Back Roads Spay Neuter. 
My organization provide MASH-style high quality high volume spay neuter 
(HQHVSN) clinics to underserved areas of the state. I am one of the top three 
veterinarians who utilize the HFM vouchers in our state. Unfortunately, I will not be 
able to attend the meeting tomorrow.
I am decidedly opposed to the proposed notion of pre-payment for spay/neuter 
services. While I find the current voucher system paper-heavy and tedious to 
complete, it is still much simpler for my business to submit batches of vouchers as 
they are issued to me. The nature of my trips and methods of reimbursement are 
variable enough that funding provided before I have performed surgeries and 
vaccinations would not work.
Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns!
Best,
Dr. Beth (Elisabeth) Sperry
