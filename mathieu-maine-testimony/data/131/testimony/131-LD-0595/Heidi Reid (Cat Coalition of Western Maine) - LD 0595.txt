LD 595 HelpFixme 
To Committee Members of the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Department 
My name is Heidi Reid, I am an active member & volunteer for Cat Coalition of Western Maine. We and many 
others are a huge part of caring for the cats in Maine. One big part of what CCOWM does is offer monthly 
spay/neuter clinics. Many of our clients are low income & cannot afford to take their cat to a veterinary 
hospital. Without the monetary assistance from this program, we would have to eliminate Helpﬁxme program, 
at our clinics, so many will not be able to participate in our clinics. 
We can’t afford to pay our amazing Vet Sarah, without some Help from Helpﬁxme, Sarah gives up one Sunday 
a month to help us. Away from her 2-year-old twins on a rare day off because she believes in what CCOWM 
does! Without Sarah there are no clinics. It goes without saying what happens when cats are not spayed& 
neutered. All which will lead to a much bigger problem, more expensive too. 
I ask that you please do not change or take away anything pertaining to low cost spay & neuter programs in the 
state of Maine. 
Thank you, 
Heidi Reid
