The Help-Fix-Me program is an excellent program and is still very much needed in 
rural Maine. Unfortunately, it has not been as effective as it should be because of 
ineffective administration. Since its inception we have tried to work with the Animal 
Welfare Program to make the program more responsive. We do not need all these 
complicated new rules; we need new management.
Susan Hall, co-founder of the HFM program has outlined in her testimony why 
passage of this legislation is necessary. Rather than reiterate it, I will simply state that 
I agree with her testimony 100%.
