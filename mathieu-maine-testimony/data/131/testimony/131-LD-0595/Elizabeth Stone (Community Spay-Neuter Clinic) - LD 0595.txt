Elizabeth Stone
Community Spay-Neuter Clinic
LD 595
My name is Dr. Elizabeth Stone. I own The Community Spay-Neuter Clinic in 
Topsham.  I am one of the few mobile spay/neuter veterinarians in Maine.  I wish to 
comment on the “Veterinarian Participation” section in the proposed rules for the 
Help Fix ME program.
I am opposed to the proposed prepayment system.  It think it is paperwork heavy and 
bureaucratic.  I would prefer to just receive batches of vouchers to use as needed.
