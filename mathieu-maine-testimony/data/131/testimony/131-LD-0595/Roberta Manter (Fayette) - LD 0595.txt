LD 595
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry,
My name is Roberta Manter and I live in Fayette.  I am writing neither for nor against LD 595 
because it is impossible to tell from the printed bill what is intended to be accomplished in the 
process of Rulemaking.  I would hope that the intent is to make this program more readily 
available.
We have a colony of feral cats on our farm.  We welcome them because they keep the rodent
population in check.  Rodents nest in the hay and contaminate it with their droppings, chew 
the strings off of the bales, chew on tack and shred horse blankets and saddle pads for 
nesting material, etc.  Since the cats have moved in we have seen a noticeable reduction in 
rodent damage.  However, enough cats is enough!  
We cannot afford on Social Security to pay over $100 per cat to get them all 
spayed/neutered.  We have looked into getting vouchers through the Help Fix ME program, 
and are preparing to send in our voucher applications as I write this.  But there is such a need
for this program that we keep being told there are no vouchers available.  Some programs do 
not return my call.  Some say on their website that they are not taking any new applicants at 
this time.  Websites have conflicting information.  The clinics that I HAVE been able to get 
through to have been very sympathetic and helpful, but there is little they can do for us until 
more vouchers come through.
It seems that what is needed most is more funding to support the voucher program.  If this bill
will accomplish that goal, then I'm all in favor of it.  But if it will make more paperwork, raise 
costs, or otherwise complicate things for the clinics that provide this much-needed service, I 
am definitely opposed to it.   Thank you.
