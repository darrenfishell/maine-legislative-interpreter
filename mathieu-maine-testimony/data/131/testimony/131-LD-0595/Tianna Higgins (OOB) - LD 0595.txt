This program needs to be accessible to all who need it and most of those people can 
not afford to travel great distances to bring their cat to a large spay event.  They need 
to be able to go to a local vet.  People who want to help control the pet population 
should be given the opportunity to do so and not have to find a large event to get their 
animal too.  That option could take too long and people will not bother.  This is wrong
and not why the program was created.  Please vote no.
