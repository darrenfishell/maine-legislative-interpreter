Dear Chairs and Committee members,
I support legislative oversight of all rule-making decisions pertaining to the Help Fix 
ME program.  
I  ask that the committee direct the Department to withdraw or greatly amend its 
current rule making proposal that makes substantive and damaging changes to the 
design of the Help Fix ME program and also creates impossible requirements for 
potential Maine-based organizations interested in administrating the program to meet.
Thank you
Mary Throckmorton
