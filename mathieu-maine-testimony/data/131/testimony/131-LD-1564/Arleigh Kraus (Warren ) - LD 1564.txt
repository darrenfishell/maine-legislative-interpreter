LD 1564
LD 1564 An Act to Eliminate Metallic Mineral Mining Activities Without a Permit
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and the Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources my name is Arleigh Kraus I am a registered cannabis caregiver 
with a B.S. in biochemistry, an organic farmer, and business owner in Warren. I am a 
board member of Maine based Citizens against Residential Mining Activities 
(CARMA) and a concerned citizen scientist. 
I am presenting testimony in support of LD1564.
Currently state law does not require any permitting for exploratory mining.  I am a 
citizen directly affected by this loophole.  The town of Warren and the neighboring 
towns of Union and Hope are today experiencing the fallout from this major flaw in 
state policy.  Exiro, a Canadian mining company has obtained land adjacent to 
Crawford Lake and in the watershed region of all three towns to conduct exploratory 
mining for a nickel deposit.  The environmental impact of this exploratory mining is 
unknown but could have everlasting negative consequences for the region. This area 
has an abundance of wildlife and it feeds directly into the St. George River and 
Penobscot Bay. This is a farming and fishing community for both agriculture and 
aquaculture including alewives, elvers, oysters, and lobster.  There are over 400 
residences within a stones throw of the exploratory site putting not only wells and 
surrounding land at risk but also the health and safety of our families from the heavy 
metals associated with metal mining.  We are frightened for our community. The lack 
of protection from this type of commercial mining endeavor to go unchecked is a 
gross oversight and must be updated and changed. 
I implore you to pass LD1564
