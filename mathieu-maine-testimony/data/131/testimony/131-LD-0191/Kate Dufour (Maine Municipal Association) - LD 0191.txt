Neither For Nor Against  
LD 191, An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding Certain Business Equipment Tax Benefits  
 
February 14, 2022  
 
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony “neither for nor against” LD 191 on behalf of 
the 70 municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Associ ation’s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal 
interest.   
While the Association appreciate s the sentiment behind LD 191 and the  need to protect 
Maine’s  heritage industries, municipal officials  are conce rned with the unintended consequences 
and the administrative burdens associated with the implementation of the proposed provision.  
Municipal assessors are unclear how this standard would be applied  or how the information 
necessary to assess eligibility  would be share d with communities and  are further  concerned that 
state reimbursement would be “clawed back” if an error was discovered after the exemption was 
granted.      
Municipal officials believe there must be other avenues for addressing the concern raised 
in LD 191 that do not shift burdens ont o municipal officials or put municipal revenues at risk.  If 
the committee elects to move forward with this measure, municipal leaders ask that you put 
safeguards in place to protect limited municipal human and financial resources.   
Thank you for cons idering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about our position, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 592 -4038.
