LD 696
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the SLG Committee,
I represent no entity or agency other than myself and would like to testify neither for
or against LD696.
There is a terrible problem, the unchecked power and lack of ethical and conflict of 
interest constraints in our constitutional officers.
I just don't know the best way to fix it.
Maybe powerful out-of-state interests and untraceable money will then influence our 
state constitutional officer positioning, who knows, but more visibility and 
transparency through an election process should be helpful. Perhaps a political 
contribution and budget cap on candidates?
Right now it seems like there is absolutely no way to hold them accountable for 
inactions, actions, or ethical breaches, until waiting for gubernatorial cycles to have 
passed to maybe see some change.
I don't know really what is worse, dark outside money in a democratic election, or 
constitutional officers campaigning on my dime and using the power of their position 
to swing the election in their favor. Both are pretty foul.
I would argue that amendment to our laws include that all Constitutional and 
Statutory Officers (Sec. of State, Treasurer, Auditor, Attorney General) employed 
while campaigning for office be required to comply with Title 5 Section 7056-A, like 
everyone else.
Right now they donâ€™t have to. Maybe we fix that loophole first?
I urge the Committee to increase democracy over these constitutional officers running
rogue in our State, not sure if LD696 is the best way to do it, but at least it allows that 
discussion to happen.
Thank you.
Dan
