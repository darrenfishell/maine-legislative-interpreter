Allow
the

Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
State
and
Local
Government,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
696
and
LD
1307.
Maine
is
the
only
state
in
the
nation
in
which
constitutional
officers—Secretary
of
State,
State
Treasurer,
and
Attorney
General,
as
well
as
the
State
Auditor—are
selected
by
legislators.
Most
states
have
adopted
a
process
of
either
gubernatorial
appointment
with
Senate
confirmation
or
popular
election.
Unfortunately,
the
current
system
benefits
entrenched
insiders
and
the
politically
well-connected.
Too
often,
personal
connections
with
legislators—more
than
professional
qualifications—influence
the
appointment
of
a
constitutional
officer.
In
recent
years,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
constitutional
officers
have
had
previous
experience
serving
in
the
Legislature,
suggesting
that
political
connections—more
than
professional
competence—influenced
their
appointments.
Constitutional
officers
are
important
bureaucrats
with
great
influence
on
public
policy,
and
they
play
a
central
role
in
ensuring
that
public
affairs
are
carried
out
in
a
coherent
and
nonpartisan
way.
They
should
reflect
the
desires
of
the
people,
not
those
of
dealmaking
politicians
in
backrooms.
Bills
like
these
appear
in
every
session,
drawing
support
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
and
everywhere
in
between.
Unfortunately,
none
have
progressed
because
legislators
are
reluctant
to
relinquish
their
power
in
this
realm.
We
are
pleased
to
see
that
this
idea
has
attracted
a
broad
array
of
co-sponsors
including
Republicans,
Democrats,
and
an
Independent.
As
the
Bangor
Daily
News
editorial
board
wrote
in
December
2020,
constitutional
officers
“are
frequently
former
lawmakers
or
former
candidates
from
whichever
party
has
a
majority
in
the
State
House
at
that
time.…In

practice,
these
offices
often
seem
to
be
a
career
step
for
whoever
is
most
popular
or
best-positioned
within
the
party
that
has
the
most
seats
in
the
Legislature.”

Maine’s
antiquated
system
is
prone
to
politicization
and
partisanship
since
the
party
that
holds
the
majority
in
the
Legislature
decides
who
to
appoint
to
these
important
positions.
This
means
Maine’s
governor
and
constitutional
officers
may
constantly
be
at
odds
with
one
another,
leading
to
brinkmanship
and
government
dysfunction.
This
is
not
a
partisan
issue;
it
is
about
whether
the
people
should
have
a
say
in
who
serves
as
their
constitutional
officers
and
State
Auditor,
or
whether
these
important
positions
should
be
chosen
inside
the
walls
of
the
State
House.
Please
deem
LD
696
and
LD
1307
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
allow
Maine
people
to
choose
their
constitutional
officers.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
