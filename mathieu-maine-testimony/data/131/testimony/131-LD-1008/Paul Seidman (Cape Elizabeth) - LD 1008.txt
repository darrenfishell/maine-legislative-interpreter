LD 1008
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Paul Seidman. I am writing to express my concerns and state that I am 
against LD 1008. I believe labeling books in such a manner as described in this bill 
stigmatizes students often already targeted for bullying, who share those identities in 
historically underrepresented groups.  
Maine schools have a duty to serve all their students, inclusive of their race and skin 
color, abilities, religion, national origin or ancestry, gender (including gender identity 
and expression), and/or sexual orientation according to Title 5, Chapter 337-B. 
Negatively rating books that feature characters who exhibit any of those protected 
identities or content related to those identities targets and pathologizes them in their 
communities.
Please vote against LD 1008. 
Thank you for considering my testimony.
