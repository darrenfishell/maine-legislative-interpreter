Re: Testimony In Opposition to LD 1008, “An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in 
School Libraries.”

I am writing to express my devout hope that you will vote against LD 1008, “An Act to Establish 
a Rating System for Books in School Libraries.” Such an effort is flat-out censorship and limits a 
student's ability to read widely in any possible area of interest. As a student in an under-
resourced Maine school in the early 1970s, I was allowed to read anything I could find, and that 
background took me to international studies, a 12-year post at Harvard Business School, and two 
post-graduate degrees. 
 
In addition, requiring publishers to assign a content rating for books ordered by Maine schools 
will substantially reduce the range of books available in the state. While we love Maine, its 
population is 0.4%  of the entire United States. The publishing industry is struggling with low 
margins as it is. It is hardly conceivable that any major publisher will develop and assign a rating 
system for books for a market that is less than 1% of the country’s total. It is far more likely that 
the publisher will simply write off sales to Maine, limiting the range of books available to our 
students.  
 
Please, please, let our students read widely and unrestrictedly by voting down LD 1008.  
 
 
Thank you.
