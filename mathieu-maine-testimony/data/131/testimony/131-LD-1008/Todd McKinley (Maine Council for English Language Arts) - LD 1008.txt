Letter ratings, content warnings, and all forms of “red-flagging” are blatant forms of 
censorship. (NCTE Position Statement, “NCTE Position Statement Regarding Rating 
or “Red-Flagging” Books”)
“Whether the labels designate reading levels, lexiles, or problematic content, the 
bottom line is that labeling accomplishes two negative outcomes: it narrows students’ 
ability to choose books based on interest, and it infringes on students’ privacy since 
the labels can be seen by others.” (NCTE Position Statement, “NCTE Position 
Statement Regarding Rating or “Red-Flagging” Books”)
School library collections are already selected by reading level and age-relevance of 
materials for the population served by the school
Requiring publishers to adhere to local standards is impractical and inappropriate, and
will artificially limit the number of vendors available and artificially limit purchase 
options.
School librarians and educators are professionals responsible for connecting students 
with materials based on their reading level and the age-appropriateness of the 
materials.
This will remove carte blanche materials that are content and age appropriate that 
have already been purchased without rating. This is censorship, as well as a waste of 
tax dollars that have already been spent.
