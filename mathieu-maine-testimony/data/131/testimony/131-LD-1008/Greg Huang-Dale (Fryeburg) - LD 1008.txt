LD 1008
Dear Honorable Legislators,
First, I want you to know that as an English and Social Studies teacher at Fryeburg 
Academy, books are still an essential part of my curriculum.  Although the circulation
of our school library may be waning some and computers, smartphones and tablets 
become the norm in my classroom, students continue to find joy and challenge 
through reading and turning pages in a good book.
Reading LD1008 also offers up a challenge to those of us who appreciate good 
literature. It begs the question, How effective have movie ratings, on the books for 
decades now, been in protecting our kids from offensive content?  And secondly, 
Why in all those years (and before) we have opted to not rate books in a similar 
fashion? 
One of my favorite books might present a good example: The Bible.  If we consider 
the wide variety of stories collected in the Christian Bible's Old and New Testaments, 
an arbiter of cultural appropriateness would be hard pressed to identify which books 
might be right for children of various ages, and yet, the Sunday School teachers at my
church wisely and capably assist their students in navigating these difficult moments 
for the good of our children.  I believe teachers in public schools are also well trained 
and conscientious people who are presenting challenging books in thoughtful and 
meaningful ways.  Students have the opportunity to hear the voices of a variety of 
authors who may not see the world as they do.  That is the essence of education - to 
open our minds.
Thank you for keeping our schools open to opportunity and free thought which 
includes voices we don't always agree with.
