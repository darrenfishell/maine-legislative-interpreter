Representative Drinkwater, I would ask what problem you are trying to fix by adding 
ratings to books in the library?
From the ala.org: "Restricting access to library materials based on age or grade level 
does not respect the individual needs, interests, and abilities of (patrons) and violates 
the Library Bill of Rights" "any private group's rating system, regardless of political, 
doctrinal, or social viewpoint, is subjective and meant to predispose the public's 
attitude. The use by libraries, therefore would violate the Library Bill of Rights. 
Libraries should remain viewpoint-neutral, providing information that patrons seek 
about any rating system equitably, regardless of the group's viewpoint. " I would ask- 
is the representative addressing a true problem schools are seeing with students 
selecting books of their choice in the library? Are students' behaviors changing due to 
the reading of books? Not only did I find a world opened up to me when I read books 
from my school library, but I was ecstatic, grateful that my 3, now adult children, 
always took advantage of the library. They learned the most amazing things, are still 
attached to the books, to the stories, to the facts, lessons learned- and my first 
grandchild, at 9 months, is already going to the library with her Mom, and is bringing 
home as many books as possible. There were no ratings back then- and there should 
be none now. Give the students the freedom to find the books which inspire them, 
comfort them, educate them. Instead, let's try and protect student by banning weapons
of war- and maybe someday, no longer having to have active-shooter drills. That's the
'safe school environment' I'm voting for.
