This
testimony
is
in
OPPOSITION
to
LD
1008
An
Act
to
Establish
a
Rating
System
for
Books
in
School
Libraries.
I
am
Kerrie
Lattari,
a
certified
Library
Media
Specialist
at
a
public
school
here
in
Maine.
I
have
multiple
concerns
regarding
this
bill,
along
with
several
questions.
The
National
Council
of
Teachers
of
English
(NCTE)
explains
that
rating
books
for
controversial
content
“reduces
complex
literary
works
to
a
few
isolated
features…undermines
the
process
of
book
selection
based
on
educational
criteria
and
significantly
reduces
students’
access
to
a
range
of
available,
high-quality
literature.”
At
school
board
meetings
across
the
state,
we
have
heard
passages
read
aloud
from
books
in
an
effort
to
have
them
removed
from
school
library
collections.
Rather
than
look
at
a
book
holistically ,
words
and
sections
are
read
out
of
context,
severely
misrepresenting
the
true
nature
of
these
texts.
LD
1008
only
gives
credence
to
the
idea
that
the
merit
of
a
book
can
be
determined
by
isolated
elements.
Collection
development
is
highly
nuanced
and
not
done
on
a
whim.
As
library
professionals,
we
use
a
variety
of
factors
and
tools
in
order
to
make
the
determination
to
purchase
a
book
for
our
student
population.
Age
level
and
age
relevance
are
already
taken
into
account
when
selecting
books
for
purchase.
Publishers,
vendors,
and
professional
book
review
publications
provide
this
information
readily.
We
do
not
need
this
bill
to
add
a
misguided
redundancy .
What
will
become
of
the
thousands
of
books
currently
housed
in
our
school
libraries
that
do
not
have
a
content
rating
on
them?
Will
they
need
to
be
removed
and
replaced
at
the
expense
of
tens
of
thousands
of
taxpayer
dollars
in
order
to
comply?
How
can
the
state
of
Maine
require
publishers
to
add
these
content
ratings?
This
is
unenforceable,
unrealistic,
and
highly
inappropriate.
When
publishers
or
vendors
do
not
comply,
where
will
we
purchase
our
materials
from?
The
options
will
be
limited
and
interfere
with
the
ability
for
students
to
access
quality
materials.
I
urge
you
to
not
enact
state-sanctioned
censorship.
Please
vote
“ought
not
to
pass”
on
LD
1008.
Thank
you,
Kerrie
Lattari
