Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Cindy Dean. I 
am a Professor of Education at the University of Maine at Augusta. My remarks are 
my own and do not represent the University of Maine System. I write in opposition to 
LD 1008, An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in School Libraries.
First, the proposed Act could potentially limit the freedom of expression and 
intellectual freedom in school libraries. The content rating system may lead to the 
exclusion of certain books or written materials from school libraries, which could 
prevent students from accessing a diverse range of ideas and perspectives. This could 
also prevent students from developing critical thinking skills and forming their own 
opinions on different issues.
Second, the proposed Act could lead to the underfunding of school libraries. 
Publishers may be less likely to distribute books or written materials with certain 
ratings, especially if they believe they will not be profitable. This could result in a 
limited selection of books in school libraries, which could negatively impact students' 
learning and education.
Last, the proposed Act could create administrative burdens for school librarians and 
staff. The process of assigning content ratings to each book or written material could 
be time-consuming and costly and could take away from other important duties and 
responsibilities.
While the intent of the proposed Act may be to protect children from potentially 
harmful content, it could have unintended consequences that limit freedom of 
expression and access to diverse ideas in school libraries. There may be more 
effective and less restrictive ways to address concerns about age-appropriate content 
in school libraries.
