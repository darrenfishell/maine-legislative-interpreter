Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee:
I'm asking that you vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 1008: An Act to Establish a Rating 
System for Books in School Libraries
I stand with the The American Library Association which opposes rating systems for 
books.  
In the context of school it is the roll of the teacher or librarian to determine material 
appropriateness for their students served.  Making the Department of Education have 
the last work on book ratings leaves this determination up to the political whims of 
the governor.  This continued politicization of classrooms and disregarding of 
educators' professional judgements is one factor that's helping to fuel a mass exodus 
from the teaching profession.  Our educators need support, not interference.
