School librarians and educators are professionals responsible for connecting students 
with materials based on their reading level and the age-appropriateness of the 
materials . Please trust the professionals to do this work.
Censorship is not the way to an educated populace.
Of what are the sponsors of this bill afraid? 
The DOE already has enough to do. Asking them to provide this service is not just 
redundant (as librarians do this work already) but would be expensive. We do not 
need this level of centralized scrutiny and control.
Thank you from a recently retired lifelong public school teacher.
