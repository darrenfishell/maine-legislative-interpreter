LD 1008
Please save the childhood of the children of the State of Maine and support LD 1008, 
LD 123, LD 618. I work in a school library (pre-K through 5th grade) and many 
books coming into the library from outside source, (which I have no control over) are 
not appropriate for this age group. LET the CHILDREN be children please
