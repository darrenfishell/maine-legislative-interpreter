LD 1008
I would like to comment on LD 1008. I am a high school librarian and have been a 
school librarian for 23 years.  I firmly believe that rating books based on content is a 
bad idea.  First, any rating system is based on personal judgment.  There is no 
unbiased way to create a rating system that accurately reflects the content of books.  
School librarians are trained professionals who use selection policies and guidelines 
to choose the books in their collections.  As professionals we are charged with 
creating a collection that reflects the diversity and needs of our populations as well as 
providing students with books and materials that expose them to the wider world and 
thoughts and ideas.  Books are a personal choice and parents have an absolute right to 
decide what is best for their own children, but rating books creates a judgment that 
limits everyoneâ€™s freedom to read.  Please let librarians do their job as the 
professionals they are and use the unbiased reviews and tools we rely on to do our 
jobs instead of a system created by individuals or groups using their own value 
judgments.
