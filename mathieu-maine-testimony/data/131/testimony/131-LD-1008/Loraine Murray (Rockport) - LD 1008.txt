Maine schools have a duty to serve all their students, inclusive of their race and skin 
color, abilities, religion, national origin or ancestry, gender (including gender identity 
and expression), and/or sexual orientation (Maine Title 5, Chapter 337-B.  Rating 
books would essentially “red-flag” content that a few might deem controversial. 
Rating books would make marginalized students even more vulnerable to harm.  
Books are a way for students to explore interests safely, and a labeling or rating 
system would remove their ability to do that.  Students have the right to see 
themselves reflected within the pages of books, but also have the opportunity to 
develop an understanding about the lived experiences of others.
