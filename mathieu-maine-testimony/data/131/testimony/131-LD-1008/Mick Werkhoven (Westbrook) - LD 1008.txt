LD 1008
I am testifying against LD 1008 – An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in 
School Libraries.
This bill is being presented as a “common sense compromise” to the complicated & 
nuanced topic of freedom of speech & censorship in school libraries. It calls to mind a
similar program championed by the music industry in the late 1980s and 1990s with 
“explicit content” stickers affixed to the front of albums deemed inappropriate. 
However, there was no standard established for the use of these explicit content 
stickers and they were assigned capriciously and overwhelmingly affected heavy 
metal music and hip-hop; two genres already the target of boycotts and censorship 
campaigns. 
With this bill I see history as poised to repeat itself once again with the practical 
effects of this bill being to censor books and topics which are already the subject of 
conversations about censorship. Historical precedent leads me to conclude that this 
rating system would be used to legitimize book censorship under the rule of 
bureaucracy and the enforcement of these ratings would primarily encompass topics 
of racial politics, sexual orientation, and gender identity. This has been the effect of 
similar rules in other categories of media for decades at this point – there is no reason 
to believe that this time the outcome will be different. 
I understand and appreciate the concerns of parents and teachers; but establishing a 
non-standardized rating system for books (that publishers may or may not even 
comply with) is not an answer to this complicated and delicate matter. Almost 40 
years after the introduction of ‘explicit content’ warning on albums there no 
indication it did anything to prevent access to music by young people, and a lot of 
indication that it stigmatized genres of music as being “not appropriate” for certain 
ages groups, and cost labels and consumers a ton of money.
