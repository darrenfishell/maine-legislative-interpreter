LD 1008
 I oppose LD 1008. There is no legitimate way to create a book rating system, 
especially for children, since age ranges, reading levels, and personal life experiences 
drastically vary. For example, it is well known that girls mature faster than boys, thus 
it would be safe to argue that one thirteen-year-old girl may be more mature and ready
to read material that another thirteen-year-old boy may not be. Rating systems are by 
design subjective. Additionally, children should challenge themselves to read books 
that are theoretically outside of their level to further their learning and reading ability. 
Lastly, we live in the technological era, and anything hidden from children in school 
can easily be found online, and likely much more graphic and harmful.
