LD 1008: An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in School Libraries 
Jesse Hargrove - Vice President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee 
May 4, 2023 
Good Afternoon Senate Chair Rafferty, Representative Chair Bremian and members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, 
My name is Jesse Hargrove. I live in Thorndike and teach Social Studies at Hermon High 
School. I serve on the RSU 3 School Board, the Thorndike Budget Committee, and as Vice 
President of the Maine Education Association. I am here today on behalf of the MEA in 
opposition to LD 1008 An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in School Libraries. 
This bill places unnecessary restrictions on the Free Market of Ideas contained within our 
libraries. Maine is a relatively small state with small schools. This gives our students 
opportunities for more personalized attention than my counterparts in other states that have class 
sizes over 30. Furthermore, our educators are known members of the community. VVhen they 
attend athletic events, concerts, and assemblies to cheer on their students, and support 
community families, it matters. The same small town charms present challenges. We would 
likely be reliant on publishers and distributors who are catering to large market states and 
districts, limiting our available options. 
This bill would also place responsibility for the initial rating in the hands of outside 
publishers, without the input of local librarians, educators, or comnnmity. These measures are 
unnecessary. Our librarians and educators already go through a variety of professional review 
that encompasses a full contextual view of text including maturity level, reading ability, factual

accuracy, and literary or artistic value. School districts have policies to guide selection of 
materials, and practices for the public to challenge materials. Parents always have the ability to 
opt their children out of library classroom materials. Our libraries are full of primary sources - 
autobiographies, historical documents, letters, speeches - as Well as secondary sources such as 
biographies, historical novels and interpretations. There are class works of literature as well as 
popular contemporary works. Our school staff and associations work hard to cater a diverse 
selection to accommodate the community. Maine has a long history and tradition of local 
governance, we should keep these decisions locally among community stakeholders rather than 
outsourcing to distant corporate entities. 
Respectfully Submitted,
