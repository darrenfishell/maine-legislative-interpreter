LD 1008
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee: 
My name is Michelle Littlefield, and I am a resident of Gorham, Maine. I was born 
and raised in this state and am proud to be raising my school-aged children here. I am 
again writing to you to, this time to strongly oppose LD 1008: "An Act to Establish a 
Rating System for Books in School Libraries."
LD 1008 is a blatant attempt to censor books. Our library staff already have processes
in place, and training for, age appropriate material selection. Our school libraries 
follow age-level and reading level relevant criteria as part of the selection process.
This bill is nothing more than another attempt by groups of extremists to demean 
Maine educators. Further, it is illogical to even conceive that a publisher would be 
willing to forgo or augment their nationally-acceptable book rating system for a local 
or state rating system. LD 1008 is nothing but government overreach and waste of tax
dollars.
Trust our educators. I ask that you do not pass LD 1008.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Michelle Littlefield
Gorham, Maine
