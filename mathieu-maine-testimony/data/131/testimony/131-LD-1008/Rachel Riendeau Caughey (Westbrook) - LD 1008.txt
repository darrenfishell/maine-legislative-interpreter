LD 1008
My name is Rachel Riendeau Caughey, a resident of Westbrook in Cumberland 
County, and Iâ€™m writing to testify against LD 1008: An Act to Establish a Rating 
System for Books in School Libraries.  As an active member of One Westbrook, a 
graduate of public elementary schools,  a sociocultural anthropologist, daughter of 
two teachers, sister to a public youth services librarian, and an expectant parent 
hoping to use Maine public schools, I know this act usurps librarians, teachers, and 
the potential for excellence and critical thinking among our students. In public 
elementary school, several of my friends and I tested at reading levels of twelfth grade
and above. This allowed us to read the full range of literature to develop our curious, 
bright minds, guided by the school librarian, our teachers, and our parents, because 
there was no rating system. We encountered difficult material and learned to ask 
adults hard questions, growing intellectually and personally in the process. This act is 
a step toward censorship that suggests mistrust of public servants who are some of our
most highly educated and caring keepers of knowledge, school librarians. It deprives 
students of flexibility and opportunities for excellence and learning, the opposite of a 
solid education. Again, I urge legislators to demonstrate their support of teachers, 
learning, and our children. You must strongly oppose and fight to stop LD 1008: An 
Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in School Libraries.
