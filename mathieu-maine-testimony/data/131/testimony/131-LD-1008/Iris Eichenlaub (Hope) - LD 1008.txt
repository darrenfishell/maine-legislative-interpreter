LD 1008
To the Respected Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee:
I'm writing to oppose LD 1008 as it abridges parental rights and leads to a slippery 
slope of censorship that has no place in a free society, and especially in a state like 
Maine which prides itself on retaining local control.
Shall we ignore the principles of Americanism, that Maine Senator Margaret Chase 
Smith stated in her Declaration of Conscience, such as the right to independent 
thought?
Labeling books is a step down the road of thought control, which Senator Smith 
decried in her famous Declaration of Conscience of 1950. Who but a child's parent 
should be responsible for what their child may read or access? 
From the position statement on labeling books from the American Association of 
School Librarians (2021): 
'A label that describes materials as “controversial” or warns readers of “mature 
themes” is an example of a label that contains a value judgment, since what is defined
as controversial varies widely from person to person. Moreover, the National Council 
of Teachers of English (2018) argues that reducing books and materials to isolated, 
potentially controversial features serves to reduce learners’ access to books both for 
leisure reading and for inclusion in classrooms. Labels that make determinations 
about a book’s content are an infringement
of a learner’s First Amendment rights to free speech and their ability to make 
determinations about what content is appropriate for them. Instead, school librarians 
should support each learner’s right to make determinations about content.'
Maine students and their parents deserve school libraries where they may freely 
access materials on a wide variety of subjects. As a parent and school librarian, I 
opposed LD 1008 for the students of Maine. 
Thank you for considering my testimony.
