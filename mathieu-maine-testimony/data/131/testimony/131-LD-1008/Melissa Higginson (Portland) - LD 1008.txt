LD 1008
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Melissa 
Higginson and I am a resident of Portland and an educator at RSU21.
I oppose LD1008.
Maine schools have a duty to serve all their students, inclusive of their race and skin 
color, abilities, religion, national origin or ancestry, gender (including gender identity 
and expression), and/or sexual orientation. Rating books that feature characters who 
exhibit any of those protected identities or content related to those identities 
pathologizes them by “red flagging” them or labeling them as “controversial” or 
“inappropriate”. Thus, labeling books in such a manner causes harm to students who 
identify with those identities.
Furthermore, Rating books requires that some individual or group makes a 
“value-judgment” about the content of the books. This is highly problematic. Who 
will get to decide what is harmful or controversial? Why should their opinion of the 
book’s content have more value than someone else’s?
Additionally, limiting students’ access to books because of the content of those books 
also limits their ability to see themselves reflected in the books they read and to 
develop an understanding of other people’s identities and experiences. This runs 
counter to the goals of Maine schools and our learning standards, which require 
students to experience literature that represents a diverse range of experiences.
For these reasons, I strongly urge the Committee to vote unanimously not to pass 
LD1008.
