School librarians are trained professionals adept at their passion: instilling a love of 
reading and literature by finding the just right book for each child. Librarians are avid 
readers who are familiar with the best in childrenâ€™s and young adult literature as well 
as familiar with the collections in their libraries. Children develop differently, going 
through development stages at different rates and times.  Assigning a cumbersome 
book rating labeling system similar to a movie rating system would limit the books 
that might be available when some students are ready for them.  Trust the trained 
professional to do the job they do best.
