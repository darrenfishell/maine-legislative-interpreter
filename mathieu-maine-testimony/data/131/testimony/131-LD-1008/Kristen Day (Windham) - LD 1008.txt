Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee Members,
My name is Kristen Day, and I'm a mother of three and taxpayer in Windham. I 
support LD 1008, as the school libraries are full of hundreds of books with obscenity 
and age-inappropriate content that distracts from the reason kids are in school to learn
and prepare to become productive, independent members of society. 
I believe some books in school libraries should be removed but others should be 
subject to a ratings system like all materials are for minors outside the school walls. 
Ideally school libraries would not need this legal oversight; but librarians, 
administration and board members have proven they do not have the interest in 
discerning what materials are appropriate for minors in school as evidenced by how 
they have exploited the exception in Maine Obscenity law for educational purposes. 
Today's kids are so burdened already with the challenges of growing up, so they 
should be able to pick up a book and not be blindsided by a graphic child rape 
passage, or sex with an animal, or a brutal murder or beating, that they cannot unread 
or an image they cannot unsee even if they choose to put the book down at that point. 
We didn't have depraved materials while we were growing up, why do we think kids 
now need it or can handle it? Can they not learn culture and compassion without 
being demoralized?
I urge you to vote yes to support LD1008 to protect kids from what is inside the pages
of the "whole" book so they can focus on empowering themselves to learn while at 
school.
