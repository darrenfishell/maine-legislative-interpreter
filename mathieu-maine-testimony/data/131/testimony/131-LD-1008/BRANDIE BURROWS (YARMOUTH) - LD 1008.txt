LD 1008
School library collections are places where learners can explore interests safely and 
without restrictions. A student has the right to access resources freely and without 
restriction and therefore I do not support the passage of LD1008. The practice of 
rating books violates both students’ and parents’ freedoms to access materials and 
potentially harms students with marginalized identities whose own identity and/or life
experiences are being shielded from them as “controversial” and “inappropriate”. This
legislation would also put a huge undue burden on both the publishing industry and 
the Department of Education. Maine schools should refrain from limiting students’ 
right to read and to maintain school and classroom library collections that allow 
students to explore interests safely and without restrictions. Please do not support the 
passage of this legislation.
