                        May 4, 2023  Senator Rafferty, Chair Representative Brennan, Chair Distinguished Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee  My name is Mary Gamble.  I am a resident of Roxbury, Maine and a school librarian.  I am submitting testimony in opposition to LD 1008.    This bill places undue burden on the DOE and publishers when resources already exist and are used by professional school librarians to evaluate and curate a collection of age-appropriate books for their school libraries.  Parents have tools as well, e.g. they can use Common Sense Media ratings at https://www.commonsensemedia.org/ to determine what books they want their children to read. Please vote no.  Please direct questions or further discussion to: marymartha725@gmail.com   Sincerely,    Mary Gamble
