Elizabeth  Andersen
Maine Association of School Libraries
LD 1008
My name is Elizabeth Andersen. I have been an educator for close to 30 years. I have 
taught at all three levels: elementary, middle, and high school, both as a classroom 
teacher and a school librarian. I write to you today as an educator, a parent of a child 
from a marginalized group, and the President-Elect of the Maine Association of 
School Libraries. 
LD 1008 proposes to establish a rating system for books that serves to only further 
marginalize students who are already some of the most vulnerable in our school 
communities. In accordance with federal civil rights laws, as an institution, a school is
prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex 
(including gender identity and sexual orientation), disability, or age. It would be 
harmful and discriminatory to “flag” books with ratings that deem them 
“controversial” or “inappropriate.” Rating systems would stigmatize certain books 
because of a “value judgment” made by publishers.
Libraries work like this, if you do not want to read a book, you do not have to. 
Students, in conjunction with their families, have the power to decide what they read. 
School librarians also work with students to help them choose books based on their 
needs, interests, reading levels, and life experience. The arbitrary ratings proposed by 
LD 1008 take away the ability of Maine school librarians to create equitable and 
inclusive conditions in their school libraries. LD 1008 will fundamentally harm Maine
students by creating environments that are restrictive and emphasize inequities. I urge 
you to vote against LD 1008.
