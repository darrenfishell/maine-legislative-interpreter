LD 1008
I am writing to oppose the passing of LD 1008, “An Act to Establish a Rating System 
for Books in School Libraries.”  The National Council of Teachers of English 
(NCTE) defines “red-flagging” of this sort as a straightforward form of censorship.  
Additionally, school libraries need no additional rating systems, and asking publishers
to conform to local standards will do nothing but reduce the number of publishers our 
local schools can work with.  For these reasons, LD 1008 ought not to pass.
