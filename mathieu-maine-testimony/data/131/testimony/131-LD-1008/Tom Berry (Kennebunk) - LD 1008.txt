RE: Testimony in Opposition to LD 1008: 
"An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in School Libraries"
My name is Tom Berry and I am a 30-year resident of Kennebunk and I’m writing to 
urge the Committee to vote: “Ought Not to Pass” on LD 1008.
I find it baffling that, after years of hearing complaints from the Conservative side of 
the political spectrum about Liberals and their “Nanny State” ideas, we find ourselves
being presented with a “Conservative” program that would strip away the right of 
individual students - and their parents - to make decisions on what books that student 
can read.  In place of the current system, a level of bureaucracy would be inserted 
where some kind of arbitrary panel would decide which books could or could not be 
used in schools.  
The potential for negative outcomes under such a system would be great.
Aside from significantly restricting the flow of information, if you’re a teacher, 
school administrator, or school board member, having the sense that the State is 
“looking over your shoulder” as you try to go about your daily work would have a 
generally chilling effect.  For fear of getting in trouble, some - perhaps, many - could 
begin to impose additional self-censorship actions that could even further limit 
students’ access to information.
Our teachers, school administrators, and local school boards are all dedicated people 
who have all students’ best interests at heart and it is my view that we should trust 
them - as well as the students themselves and their parents - to do what is right.
Leave “Big Government” out of it.  Vote “Ought Not to Pass” on LD 1008.
Thank you for considering this testimony.
