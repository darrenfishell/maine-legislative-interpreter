LD 1008
I strongly oppose LD 1008 because the practice of rating books violates students’ and 
parents’ freedom to read. Labeling books could also cause harm to students who 
identify with historically underrepresented groups.
Maine schools have a duty to serve all their students, inclusive of their race and skin 
color, abilities, religion, national origin or ancestry, gender (including gender identity 
and expression), and/or sexual orientation (Maine Title 5, Chapter 337-B: 
https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/5/title5ch337-Bsec0.html) Rating books that 
feature characters who exhibit any of those protected identities or content related to 
those identities pathologizes them by “red flagging” them or labeling them as 
“controversial” or “inappropriate”(NCTE Position Statement Regarding Rating or 
“Red-Flagging” Books https://ncte.org/statement/rating-books/). Thus, labeling of 
books in such a manner causes harm to students who identify with those identities.
Rating books requires that some individual or group makes a “value-judgment” about 
the content of the books (ALA Position Statement on Labeling Practices, p. 2 
https://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/advocacy/statements/docs/AA
SL_Labeling_Practices_Position_Statement_2021a.pdf). This is highly problematic. 
Who will get to decide what is harmful or controversial? Why should their opinion of 
the book’s content have more value than someone else’s?
I believe that parents should have the right to determine what their own children read 
and have access to. Removing access to certain books takes this right away from 
parents by eliminating their ability to choose books for their own children.
