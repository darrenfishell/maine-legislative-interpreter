Dear Committee Members:
The books that are in some schools now are rated 18 or over on Amazon or other 
book sellers sites.  Let's bring Common Sense back into the school system.  
This bill would establish guidelines to follow, with what is or is not appropriate in 
school libraries
I ask that you vote OUGHT to PASS this bill.  Thank you..
