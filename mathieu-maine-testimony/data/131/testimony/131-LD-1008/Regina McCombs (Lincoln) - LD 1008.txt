I have some big concerns about developing a rating system for books in school 
libraries. I am afraid that this system will be used to limit students access to books 
that others, besides their parents, don’t think they should be reading. I am afraid that 
the system will be focused on negatively rating books with themes not approved by 
the system creators. Why should one group’s opinions be more valued than another 
ones?  
Creating a valid rating system for anything is a complex process. These systems are 
prone to bias and fraud and “skewing”. Just think about all the things we are asked to 
rate in our lives – Amazon purchases, workshop presentations, customer service 
experiences. I am not sure if they give any real clue as to the value of the goods and 
services. Developing a valid rating system for books would seem to be a nearly 
impossible task. 
As a retired school librarian of too many to count years I can promise you that 
librarians work really hard to provide appropriate books for all their patrons. They are
trained to work with their patrons, to consult professional resources, and to 
understand their communities values in the process of selecting materials. Another 
thing I can promise you is that if a parent does not want their child to read certain 
books all they have to do is let the librarian know. That way other kids don’t lose 
access to the materials. School librarians don't need any outside agency to rate their 
books. They work with a harder rating system than government could ever provide - 
Students!
