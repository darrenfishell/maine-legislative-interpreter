LD 1008
Dear Committee, 
My name is Colin Vettier and I'm a Portland resident. 
I am appalled at yet another attempt to blindside our youth on some false pretense 
(that are mostly not even grounded in reality). Education should not be a political tool
to ensure our children remain ignorant. 
If our politics were genuinely interested in educating the next generations, they would
fund public education or better yet, they would become teachers. In the meantime, 
they should leave it to the professionals to decide what is valuable educational 
material. 
In an age ripe with mass shooting, political division seeding hatred, racism and so 
many phobias, is that really the best we can do to protect our children? Tell them what
they should learn and read? 
I am against LD 1008 and I hope that the committee will appreciate that banning 
subjects from schools is a clear and present danger to our freedom and democracy.
