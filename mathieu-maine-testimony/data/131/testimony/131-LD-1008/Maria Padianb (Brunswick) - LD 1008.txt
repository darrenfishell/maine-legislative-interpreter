LD 1008
As a Maine author of books for young readers and as a parent I strongly object to 
passage of LD 1008.
School library collections are already selected by reading level and age-relevance of 
materials for the population served by the school. Any ratings, content warnings or 
“red-flagging” are blatant forms of censorship.
School librarians and educators are already trained to connect students with materials 
based on their reading level and maturity. Requiring publishers and/or outside groups 
to create a rating system for all materials would be burdensome and costly and 
ultimately result in limiting purchase options for our collections.
