I am strongly opposed to LD 1008. 
Rating books requires someone to make a judgment call on whether or 
not a book is “acceptable” This truly is passing judgement on 
someone’s writing.   Why does someone else’s opinion about a book 
carry more weight than my opinion?     Why can’t parents of minors 
notify schools that they do not want their children to read books that 
are offensive to them?  Why would any other parent get to dictate 
what MY children may read?  We can’t necessarily change parents’ 
minds if they find a book unsuitable, but we can protect all our children 
from being dictated to by a select group of adults who think they know 
better than other parents.    Please vote AGAINST LD 1008.
