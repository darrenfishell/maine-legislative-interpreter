LD 1008
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs:
I am writing today to oppose LD 1008. 
Maine schools have a duty to serve all their students, inclusive of their race and skin 
color, abilities, religion, national origin or ancestry, gender (including gender identity 
and expression), and/or sexual orientation (Maine Title 5, Chapter 337-B) Rating 
books that feature characters who exhibit any of those protected identities or content 
related to those identities pathologizes them by “red flagging” them or labeling them 
as “controversial” or “inappropriate”(NCTE Position Statement Regarding Rating or 
“Red-Flagging” Books). Labeling of books in such a manner causes harm to students 
who identify with those identities.
Can you imagine being the child of a same sex couple and seeing a book "flagged" as 
inappropriate/wrong - when you see your very own family represented in that book? 
What if you are a transgender youth and a book is flagged and you suddenly start to 
think that living outside the binary makes you a pariah? These are very real concerns 
that impact our children and students. 
I believe that parents should have the right to determine what their own children read 
and have access to. Removing access to certain books takes this right away from 
parents by eliminating their ability to choose books for their own children.
Please join me in opposing this bill.
