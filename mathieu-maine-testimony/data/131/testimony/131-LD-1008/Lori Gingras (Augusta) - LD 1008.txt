LD 1008
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Lori Gingras. I live and work in central Maine. I am a high school 
English teacher and the mother of two teen boys. 
I oppose LD 1008 - An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in School 
Libraries.
Who is to say what is appropriate or inappropriate for individuals? It is a decision that
should be left up to individuals and their families. This bill would cause more harm 
than good. Censorship has no business in Maine schools!
Sincerely,
Lori Gingras
