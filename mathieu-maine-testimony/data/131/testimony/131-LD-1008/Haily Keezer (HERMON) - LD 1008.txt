LD 1008-"An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in School Libraries" 
“OUGHT TO PASS.”
I am here today to testify in support that LD1008 “OUGHT TO PASS.”
I am a Mother, registered nurse, and School board member. The current exemption in 
the law and the law’s lack of a content rating system for explicit materials has allowed
schools and special interest groups to warp the exemption as it was once intended for. 
Our state-run schools have been infiltrated with graphic and explicit content that is 
not appropriate for minor children. These books are often written in a cartoon or 
sketch fashion making them more appealing to children. Children would be less likely
to understand the content they are viewing or reading and the lasting effects it will 
have on them. 
Parents have continued to share the negative effects this content has had on their 
children at school board meetings. 
Books are both available in the library, classrooms, and even the curriculum. The 
books available in the classroom are not tracked in a database, so parents do not know
what is available to their children. Books that are donated to the school are not 
tracked. The school board is not overseeing the books or curriculum as they should 
be. The school board will not create or enforce a policy that restricts sexually explicit 
content, drug use, etc. Schools are currently defending their position based on 
Maine’s current exemption in the law to explicit material.  
I believe that LD 1008 is an important step in the right direction.
I urge you to vote “OUGHT to PASS” on LD 1008 to ensure we can protect our 
minor children from the graphic and explicit content they currently have available to 
them with little oversight. 
Thank you.
