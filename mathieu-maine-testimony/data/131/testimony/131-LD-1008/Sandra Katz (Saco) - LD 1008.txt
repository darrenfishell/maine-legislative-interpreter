LD 1008
I am writing to oppose LD1008, an act to establish a rating system for books in public
libraries. This is clearly a form of censure and should not be allowed. Who would 
decide how to rate books and on what basis? Books in a public library should all be 
available to everyone. Let people read books and decide for themselves what they 
believe.
Thank you for your time.
