Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs
Committee.
My
name
is
Nicole
W illard
and
I
am
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
for
the
Maine
Council
for
the
Social
Studies
(“MCSS”).
MCSS
is
the
lar gest
professional
or ganization
for
social
studies
teachers
in
the
State
of
Maine
and
we
are
af filiated
with
the
National
Council
for
Social
Studies
(“NCSS”),
the
lar gest
professional
or ganization
for
social
studies
teachers
in
the
United
States.
One
of
the
goals
of
MCSS
is
to
“provide
institutional
representation
for
the
interests
of
and
concerns
of
social
studies
educators”.
I
am
submitting
this
testimony
on
behalf
of
the
board
and
members
of
MCSS
in
opposition
to
L.D
1008.
The
MCSS
Board
unanimously
opposes
LD
1008.
This
bill
could
limit
student’ s
access
to
books
based
on
a
rating
system
that
does
not
take
into
consideration
the
individual
student
nor
the
curriculum.
T eachers
and
parents
in
local
districts
are
better
informed
about
what
may
or
may
not
be
appropriate
for
a
student
or
a
class.
A
rating
system
such
as
the
one
detailed
in
LD
1008
could
deprive
students
of
engaging
historical
biographies,
non-fiction,
and
historical
fiction.
Under
a
system
such
as
this,
a
student
ready
to
engage
in
a
book
like
The
Diary
of
Anne
Frank
might
not
have
access
until
the
age
of
eighteen.
Students
engage
and
learn
from
what
might
be
considered
controversial
material
by
some
and
they
should
not
be
deprived
based
on
such
a
subjective
rating
system.
The
Maine
Council
for
Social
Studies
ur ges
the
Committee
to
vote
Ought
Not
to
Pass
on
LD 
1008.
