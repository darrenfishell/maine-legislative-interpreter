Re: Testimony in Support of LD 1498 and LD 1244.
Hi-
My name is Clare Moss LCSW and I practice in Falmouth
I am writing to urge you to vote “ought to pass” LD 1498 and LD 1244.
I have been horrified by what Anthem insurance has been doing without penalty for 
the last few years, not paying providers, not being responsive to providers and clients 
about lack of payments. I have had to tell prospective clients that I can’t take them 
because of non payment or bizarre payments. At one point I received reimbursement 
of less than dollar for one client and was on hold for 65plus minutes and spoke to 
someone who sent me to the escalation department who promptly hung up on me.
I was so desperate to be paid and be heard I tracked down the name of the CEO of 
Anthem (Gail Boudreaux) and emailed her. She responded to me and fixed that 
particular client but the problem continued with other clients so she did not fix the 
larger issue and no longer accepted emails and the problems continued.
For small businesses like mine losing time and money means that the practitioner is 
hurt financially and out a lot of non reimbursable time on follow up and so are the 
clients we serve and can’t just drop. I haven’t taken a new Anthem client since this 
fiasco because I don’t believe the monolith that is Anthem has changed their policies 
because there has been little consequence to them.
I wholeheartedly support these two bills.
