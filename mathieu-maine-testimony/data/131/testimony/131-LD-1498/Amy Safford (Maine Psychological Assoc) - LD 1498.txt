Re: LD 1498: An Act to Create an Advocacy and Complaint Process for Health Care Providers Within the 
Bureau of Insurance – Letter of Support  
 
Dear Representative PERRY and Representative O'NEIL, Senator LAWRENCE and Representatives  DANA, 
GRAMLICH, MATHIESON, STOVER, and Senator CURRY : 
 
The Maine Psychological Association (MePA ) is a membership organization representing psychologists in 
Maine who work in private practice, at Maine’s colleges and universities, and in the public sector. Our 
mission is to advance psychology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promoting  health and 
human welfare.  
 
MePA supports LD 1498: An Act to Create an Advocacy and Complaint Process for Health Care Providers 
Within the Bureau of Insurance. The complaint process is challenging for psychologists and other 
providers, and we advocate for  the development of a mechanism to allow providers to advocate for 
patients and clients.  
Moreover, as an alternative to the establishment of a Health Care Provider Assistance Division within 
the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau o f Insurance, we suggest the Bureau of 
Insurance create an ombudsman’s office to address the problem.  
Thank you for your attention.  
Sincerely,  
 
 
Jamie Pratt, PsyD  
President
