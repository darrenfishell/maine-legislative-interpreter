Testimony of the  Maine O steopathic Association  
Before the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services  
 
In Reference to:  
LD 1498, An Act to Create an Advocacy and Complaint Process for Health Care Providers Within 
the Bureau of Insurance  
Public Hearing: Monday, April 24, 2023 10:00 AM,  Cross Building, Room 220  
 
Senator  Bailey, Representative  Perry and distingu ished members of the Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services , 
 
The Maine Ost eopathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization  representing appro ximately 40 0 
osteopathic physicians as well as more t han 700 residents and students. Our missio n is to “ serve the Osteopathic 
profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated  effort of professional education, advocacy and member 
services in order to ensure the availability of quality oste opathic health  care to the people of  this State.”  
 
The MOA is pleased  to provide comments in reference to LD 1 498. We are in support of this bill  as a potential 
solution to a growing problem betwee n insurance carriers and Maine’s healthcare providers , that we see as 
particularly crippling for  smaller practices .  
 
As has been widely publicized in the media, our members are facing some serious challenges  in simply getting 
paid for their servi ces. Many  of these issues result in harm to the patie nt/consumer and as such are not just 
provider -insurer contract issues .  
 
We believe the authority of the Bureau of Insurance should  be expanded to enable them to intervene in 
provi der/payer disputes.  It is import ant for you to know that providers and their pr ofessional associations, like th e 
MOA, do regularly attempt  to get these problems resolved with payors directly . The MOA  and other provider 
associations have also reached out to the Bureau  of Ins urance in the past when our members report  specific issues 
that are widespread to a partic ular insurer , service,  or practice area. As an exa mple, the M OA, along with several 
other provider groups met with the Bu reau in December 2021 . While ou r concerns were heard , we we re told that 
the Bureau  cannot get involved  in carrier/ provid er disputes . 
 
Here is a list  of some  of the frustrating issues our members have report ed in trying to get claims paid with 
insurers : 
 
• General Cust omer  Service  Issues —Long hold t imes when calling to discuss claims, dropped calls with no call 
back, appeal letters and remittances that all have different contact numbers, only allowed to discuss one claim at a 
time and asked to call back for others, chat feature s on online portals tha t do not actually work, or responses are 
incoherent, written correspondence that is also incoherent , lack of access to provider re lations  team members, etc. 
• Poor Communication regarding policy and prov ider agreement updates – Not clear where to find updat ed 
provider manuals, inconsistency in these manuals, rushed system updates that cause problems that cannot be 
immediately resolved (i.e. system began using a new version of NPI number and some provider s forced to 
resubmit all  claims  from a certain time per iod) 
•Claims S ubmission/ Resubmission/Appeals – Responses to claims do not indicate where in the appeals process 
the claim exists (should they resubmit/reconsider or appeal or clinical review?) Online claims submission is not 

 2 easy to upload records or other  documentation and no fax number is provided to send this information, appeals 
need to be sent via certified mail and the signing individual may not actually identify themselves so that they 
could be contacted for follow up, Denying claims and refusing to clearly tell the provider why the claim was 
denied so the provider can correct the error and resubmit the claim or file an appeal , Not providing consistent and 
correct information on how providers can file appeals (verbal ins tructions inconsistent with pro vider manual 
instructions)  
 
It is a si gnificant investment of time to simply ensure you are getting paid for valid medical services. As such, it ’s 
become almost impossible to be a sol o physi cian practice with a small footprin t providing  care in a Maine 
community, something which was once commonplace. Some small practice memb ers we have heard from have 
had to hire a new staff member  just to sort th rough claims to understand which were paid, which we denied and in 
need o f appeal , etc.  And when appeals are nec essary, ph ysicians often end up  sharing their documentation from 
patients visits and then writing letter s to further explain  why the provided services should be paid. These are hours 
that take away from their ability to provi de care for additional patients  and certainly add to physician burnout , 
encouraging physicians to ret ire or leave me dicine at alarming rates.  
 
Meetings or not, in many cases  problems getting paid have pe rsisted and escalated to the point they are 
threatening the viability of many practices across a wide spectrum of providers.  Many providers believe this is 
comprom ising the care they are able to  offer their patients and are forced to consider terminating  their provider 
agreements as a result.   
 
We want to ensure that our members’ concerns are addressed in the best interests of ensuring Maine consumers 
have access t o and receive the medically nec essary benefits their health plans a re supposed to cover. And we see 
LD 1498 as a way to provide a path of recourse to M aine’s providers so th at they can continue to provide quality  
healthcare, before the ir frustration  forces  them out of  practice or ou t of the state.  We would urge you to vote 
Ought to P ass on LD 1498.
