Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennen and members of the Educational and 
Cultural Affairsâ€™ Committee, my name is Tony Maker, Principal of the Elm Street 
School in East Machias. I am here today to testify in favor of LD 386. 
As Maine has tried to lessen the impact of soaring heating and diesel fuel on 
individuals and families, one crucial segment has been omitted, the public 
schools. 
It would have been impossible to correctly budget for the increased costs of 
heating and transportation. Thankfully, the winter has been warmer than 
expected. However, the miles traveled on buses to transport students to and from 
home, to athletic events, and curriculum enrichment opportunities has put a real 
strain on budgets even to the point of considering canceling some events. This 
bill would gives schools a one time buffer to help ensure the entire educational 
journey is protected. 
l urge you to support LD 386 unanimously. 
On a side note, during the pandemic we were urged to increase ventilation by 
keeping classroom windows open. lt was also recommended that we limit the 
number of students on buses, thus doubling some routes. Of course this 
increased fuel usage. However, we were not permitted to use any Covid relief 
money for fuel costs at all. Like so many times with hasty government initiatives, 
common sense is often missing. 
Thank you for your time, 
Tony Maker, Principal 
Elm Street School 
East Machias, Me
