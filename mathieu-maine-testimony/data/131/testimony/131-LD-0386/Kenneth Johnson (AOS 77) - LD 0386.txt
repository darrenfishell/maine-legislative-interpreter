Several of the school departments in my small rural district are facing significantly 
higher than anticipated fuel costs. Lubec in particular stands out since they also have 
suffered damage to their roof and pipes due to extreme weather conditions, but they 
are not alone in facing hardship.  With still another 6 weeks or so of expected winter 
conditions, budgeted amounts for heating fuel are being tested.
