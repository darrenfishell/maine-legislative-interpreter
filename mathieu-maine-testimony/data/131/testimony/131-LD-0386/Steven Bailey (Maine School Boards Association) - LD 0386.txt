TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 386 
AN ACT TO ASSIST SCHOOLS WITH HEATING AND TRANSPORTATION 
FUEL COSTS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I am 
Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative 
committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents Association in support of 
L.D. 386. 
Superintendents are reporting that they will over expend energy and transportation budgets due to the increased costs 
which will result in having to transfer funds from another cost center, affecting other parts of the budget and 
programs. 
This bill asks for one-time funds of $100 per student to pay for heating and transportation costs in recognition that 
fuel costs have increased substantially. The chart below provided by the Governor ’s Energy Ofﬁce shows the highs 
and lows by region.

Diesel fuel remains well above $5 per gallon and had been above $6 as the school year began. 
We understand this proposal does not follow the formula for Essential Programs and Services where a district ’s share 
of state aid is based on a community ’s ability to pay. That formula, as you know, includes the cost of running schools 
Our legislative committees considered that and agreed we are in extraordinary times where few could have predicted 
what fuel prices were going to do based on international events and what We hope are extraordinary circumstances, 
most notably Russia’s war against Ukraine. 
By providing this one-time relief, superintendents would not have to look in other areas that could impact student 
learning to cover the over expenditures. We applaud the equitable distribution of funds by allocating the funds per 
student keeping the distribution of funds outside of the 279 calculation.
