Testimony for 
The Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
February, 16, 2023 
To: Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other Distinguished Members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee 
From: Scott K. Porter, Superintendent of Schools, AOS 96 (11 Towns in Machias Area) 
LD 386: “An Act to Assist Schools with Heating and Transportation Fuel Costs During the 
School Year”. 
As you know, all energy costs, are extraordinarily high this year. The cost of heating fuel at the 
beginning of the 2022/2023 school year had increased by 100% compared to the fall of 2021, 
while the cost of diesel fuel increased by 73% in the same time period. The Governor and Maine 
Legislature have worked hard to provide heating fuel relief to Maine families. It is our hope that 
you will extend relief to Maine School Districts as well. We all increased our fuel budgets, but 
some of our schools will not have enough money in budget lines to pay our heating and diesel 
fuel bills. Unfortunately, Federal Covid funds cannot be used to purchase heating fuel or diesel 
fuel. 
LD 386 provides $100.00 per student in extra money for district fuel costs in these unusual 
times. It is my hope that you will support LD 386. 
Thank you.
