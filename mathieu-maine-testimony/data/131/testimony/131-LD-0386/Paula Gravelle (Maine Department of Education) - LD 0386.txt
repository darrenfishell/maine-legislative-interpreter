Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committees:  
LD 386, An Act to Assist Schools with Heating and Transportation Fuel Costs During the School 
Year  (EMERGENCY) , proposes t o provide one -time funding assistance to public elementary 
and secondary schools for heating and transportation costs  as emergency legislation . The bill 
identifies the amount of the funding to be equal to $100 per student based on the most recent 
enrollment totals and proposes to allocate $18,000,000 for 2022 -2023 from the General Fund.   
The student count for schools can be based on one of two numbers, and the current language 
does not specify which count to use to determine the $100 per -student total for each school 
administrative unit (SAU) .  The atte nding count includes SAUs that operat e and maintain 
buildings.  The subsidy count includes all SAUs that are fiscally responsible for student s and 
may not operate a school building. The count to be used to determine the per -student amount 
must be specified.   
There are two mechanisms by which  the Department of Education ( DOE ) could distribute the 
one-time emergency payments.  First, the funds could be included in the monthly EPS 
distributions between the enactment of bill and th e end of this fiscal year.  Second, the DOE 
could produce an indiv idual manifest for each SAU and distribute the funds through a one -time 
payment.   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 386 and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
