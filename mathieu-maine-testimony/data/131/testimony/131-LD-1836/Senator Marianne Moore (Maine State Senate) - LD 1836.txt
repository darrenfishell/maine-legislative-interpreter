 Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and Members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
provide testimony in support of LD1836, which relates to coverage of medically 
necessary breast diagnostic and supplemental imaging.  My name is Marianne 
Moore.  I proudly represent Senate District 6, which includes all of Washington 
County along with 16 Communities in Eastern Hancock County as well.   
 
I personally wanted to sponsor this bill because I was one of the estimated 12-16 
percent of women screened for my mammography who required follow-up 
diagnostic imaging. While I was able to afford my diagnostic imagining, I know not 
everyone is as fortunate. It is my hope with this legislation more women will not 
let financial barriers delay an early diagnosis of breast cancer and further delay 
treatment options.  
 
We know the longer it takes for women to detect breast cancer, the quicker their 
five-year survival rates decline1. This legislation will afford women the 
opportunity to make these decisions about their health without being limited by 
their financial situation.  
 
A Susan G. Komen-commissioned study  found that the average out-of-pocket 
costs for diagnostic imaging examinations ranged from $234 to $1,021. 
Eliminating out-of-pocket costs for diagnostic and supplemental imaging would 
improve access and likely result in more patients receiving an earlier diagnosis. 
 
In 2023 alone, more than 1,450 individuals will be diagnosed with breast cancer 
and more than 190 will die of the disease in Maine. These diagnostic imaging

examinations are critical to allow for early detection and to catch the disease 
before it spreads. As legislators, we can eliminate this barrier to healthcare in 
Maine. 
 
As we continue to fight for a cure for breast cancer, our goal with this bill is to 
eliminate burdensome patient cost sharing and provide equitable access to 
medically necessary diagnostic and supplemental breast imaging and provide 
Mainers with the best possible chance of surviving this disease.  
I ask for your support and will attempt to answer any questions at this time. 
Thank you!
