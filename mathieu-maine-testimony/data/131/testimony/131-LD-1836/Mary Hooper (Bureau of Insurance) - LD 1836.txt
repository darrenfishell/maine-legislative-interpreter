Re: L.D. 1836, An Act Regarding Insurance Coverage for Diagnostic and Supplemental 
Breast Examinations 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 1836.  The purpose of this letter is to provide 
you with background information. This bill would prevent carriers offering health plans in the 
State from imposing any cost-sharing requirements on medically necessary diagnostic breast 
examinations or supplemental breast examinations performed by a health care provider.  The 
requirements of this bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2024.   
Currently, coverage for preventive mammography is already provided by insurers since it is on 
the USPSTF’s recommended list with a “B” rating.   According to their website, the USPSTF 
recommends  biennial screening mammography for women aged 50 to 74 years.  The USPSTF 
also recommends screening for women aged 40 to 49 years with a “C” rating.  Diagnostic 
examinations are also covered by insurance but are typically subject to cost-sharing 
requirements.  According to the  2017 Kaiser Women’s Health Survey , 16% of women with 
private insurance reported paying out-of-pocket costs for a mammogram.  
Maine law since 1997 (24-A M.R.S. §§ 2745-A, 2837-A, and 4237-A) has required coverage of 
screening mammograms and now states they are required to be covered each year for individuals 
age 40 and over. A screening mammogram also includes an additional radiologic procedure 
recommended by a provider when the results of an initial radiologic procedure are not 
definitive.   
For the Committee’s reference, Page 6 of the Bureau’s “ Report  of the Superintendent of 
Insurance on Mandated Health Insurance Claims” contains information on the number of 
screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms covered each year. In 2021, individual 
and group insurance in Maine covered 65,626 screening mammograms and 17,853 diagnostic 
mammograms.  
This bill would likely result in some premium impact since carriers would be required to waive 
cost-sharing on diagnostic examinations that are currently subject to cost-sharing.

The requirement to prohibit insurers from imposing any cost-sharing requirement conflicts with 
federal laws as it relates to high-deductible health plans.  The Committee may want to consider 
the unintended consequences associated with imposing a requirement that would conflict with or 
be preempted by federal law.   
We don’t believe this bill would require defrayal since it is a cost-sharing requirement and would 
likely represent an expansion of an existing mandated coverage.   
If a report is required it could cost the Bureau of Insurance up to $13,500 for outside contract 
consulting work plus staff time, estimated at a cost of $1,600 to collect information, review 
consultant work, and prepare the final report. 
I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance. 
Sincerely, 
 
Timothy N. Schott
