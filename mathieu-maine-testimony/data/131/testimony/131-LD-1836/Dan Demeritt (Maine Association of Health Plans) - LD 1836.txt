Testimony of Dan Demeritt 5/8/23 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
In Opposition to LD 1836 
An Act Regarding Insurance Coverage for Diagnostic and Supplemental Breast Examinations 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Demeritt, the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people by promoting 
affordable, safe, and coordinated healthcare. 
The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance plans to provide mammogram screening 
every two years for women over 50, as recommended by a provider for women 40 to .49, and for 
Women at higher risk for breast cancer without cost share.‘ Maine law also provides that frilly 
insured individual and group plans must provide coverage for mammogram screening for women 
over 40. 
Maine’s mandate for mammogram screening was established before passage of the ACA and 
would be repealed by LD 1836. 
The Bureau of Insurance Report on Mandated Health lnsurarrce Claims for the Year 2021 reports 
that fully insured plans in Maine covered 65,626 mammogram screenings.2 Preventative health 
care services like mammogram screenings are typically covered at 100% because early detection 
saves lives and saves costs across the lrealtlrcare system. 
The Bureau also reports that l7,853 diagnostic mammography exams were covered in 2021.3 
These diagnostic services are typically subject to cost shares pursuant to an enrollee ’s coverage 
that help keep premiums afford able and more Mainers in our health insurance market. 
L.D. 1836 creates a definition for “supplemental breast examination, ” that includes the use of 
diagnostic mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasounds. The supplemental 
examination would screen for breast cancer in patients based on personal or family medical 
history or other factors that suggest an individual has an increased risk for breast cancer. 
Requiring new examinations for supplemental preventative screening may also be an expansion 
of Maine’s essential health benefits and should require a mandate study by the Bureau.

The bill also defines diagnostic breast examinations as a medically necessary examination 
utilizing diagnostic rnarnrnography, MRIs or ultrasounds. 
The proposal would prohibit cost-sharing such as deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance for 
these both supplemental and diagnostic examinations that apply to most non-preventative 
services and treatments health care providers deliver. 
This would create what is commonly called “first dollar” coverage for supplemental breast 
examination and diagnostic examinations, shifting the risk and costs of services utilized by some 
enrollees to all health insurance purchasers and premium payers. 
Requiring first dollar coverage for any service increases the cost of premiums and can drive 
people from our insurance markets. 
If the committee is interested in moving forward with this legislation, we would note 
catastrophic plans and Health Savings Account compatible plans cannot provide first dollar 
coverage and must be excluded. 
Thank you for your consideration. I urge you to vote “ought not to pass” on L.D. 1836, andI 
would be happy to answer any questions.
