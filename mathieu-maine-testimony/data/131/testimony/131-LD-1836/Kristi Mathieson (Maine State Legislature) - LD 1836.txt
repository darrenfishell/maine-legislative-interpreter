Testimony of Representative Kristi Mathieson presenting 
LD 1836, An Act Regarding Insurance Coverage for Diagnostic and 
Supplemental Breast Examinations 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
Good morning Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services. My name is Kristi 
Mathieson and I have the distinct pleasure of representing the beautiful seaside community of 
Kittery, District 151. I am here to present LD 1836, An Act Regarding Insurance Coverage 
for Diagnostic and Supplemental Breast Examinations. 
Diagnostic breast exams and supplemental breast exams are critical components of breast cancer 
screening and prevention. By detecting breast cancer early, these exams can save lives and 
reduce the need for more invasive and expensive treatments. I introduce this legislation not only 
on behalf of a dear friend who lost her life, very early in her life with a delayed breast cancer 
diagnosis, but also as one who has personal experience requiring follow up examinations after 
most marmnography exams, be it a needle biopsy, an ultrasound or a combination of both. 
Some important statistics: 
0 It is estimated that 40% of women in the US have dense breast tissue and this dense 
tissue makes it more difficult to detect breast cancer through mammography. L23‘ 
Q 12~16% of women screened with a mammogram require a follow-up diagnostic imaging 
examination. 1323 
¢ Research suggests that when women with dense breast tissue do not receive supplemental 
breast exams, up to one-third of breast cancer diagnoses can be missed. 1323 
v The longer it takes for Women to detect breast cancer, the quicker their ﬁve-year survival 
rates decline.1 
0 The Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) study estimates the cost impact of 
eliminating cost-sharing requirements for diagnostic imaging examinations for diagnostic 
evaluation of the breast at $0.07 per member per month or about $0.83 per year.I 
attached this study to my testimony. 
0 Massachusetts assessment of requiring coverage for diagnostic examinations estimated an 
average increase to the typical member’s monthly health insurance premium between 
District I51: Kittery
$0.19 and $0.33 per member per month (PMPM). I emailed this as the study was very 
long. 
0 Medicaid provides these diagnostic exams at no cost to patients. 
r Similar legislation in other states have successfully been enacted in Arkansas, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, Maryland, Montana, 
Oklahoma and Texas. Tennessee and Washington currently have legislation passed and 
are awaiting the govemor’s signature. 
Imposing cost sharing on these exams can discourage individuals from seeking necessary care, 
leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment that can have serious consequences. By eliminating 
cost sharing health insurance policies, we can ensure that individuals have access to the care they 
need to stay healthy and prevent much more serious health issues from arising in the future. It is 
important to ensure that all women, regardless of their breast density or other risk factors, have 
access to comprehensive breast cancer screening exams when appropriate. With this access, 
breast cancer is detected earlier when it is most treatable, and can help to support the health and 
wellbeing of women and their families. 
I know you are considering many bills and appreciate your thoughtful attention today. I ask the 
committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD I836. 
Thank you for your time and I would be happy to answer any questions.

RE: Request for Cost Estimate to Eliminate Cost-Sharing for Diagnostic Screening for Breast 
Cancer and Diagnostic Evaluation of the Breast 
Dear Delegate Sheree Sample-Hughes: 
The Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) is pleased to submit this response to your January 
11, 2022 letter requesting a study to estimate the cost impact of eliminating cost-sharing 
requirements for diagnostic imaging examinations for diagnostic evaluation of the breast. MHCC 
estimates that the elimination of cost-sharing will add about $0.07 per member per month or 
about $0.83 per year to privately insured health care premiums. It is important to note that 
mammography screening is considered an essential health beneﬁt under the Affordable Care Act and 
a preventive health care service in the fully-insured large group market; therefore, mammography 
screening is not subject to cost-sharing. As a result, this analysis is an estimate on the elimination of 
cost sharing for diagnostic testing only. 
The results of our analysis indicate that the cost impact, if the member out of pocket (OOP) cost 
requirements for diagnostic imaging examinations or diagnostic evaluations of the breast were 
eliminated, is about $0.07 per member per month (PMPM). We expect this cost to remain relatively 
ﬂat with modest changes in utilization for women ages 30 and older, since there were slight 
variations in the member OOP costs over the last four years (2017 - 2020). However, after a modest 
decrease (-6.3%) in 2018, the cost per service shows a steady increase through 2020, ending up at 
about 14.5%. The PMPM allowed charges across the entire fully-insured population have been 
relatively stable (averaging about $0.19) over the last four years, despite slight volatility in utilization 
(decrease in 2018, increase in 2019, and then a decrease in 2020).

Using the average 2018 PMPM premiums by market ($547 for individual, $448 for small group, and 
$485 for fully-insured large group) from MHCC’s “Study of Mandated Health Insurance Services as 
Required Under Insurance Article §] 5-1502 ” premiums were projected out one year to 2019 and two 
years to 2020 using annual PMPM allowed observed medical trends by market. Results show in the 
above table that the cost for eliminating the member cost-sharing is about 0.01% of premium across 
all markets (individual, small group, and fully-insured large group). Although costs for the illness 
burden for the privately fully-insured population, level of beneﬁt coverage, and medical management 
will vary by insurance market due to differences in health insurance carrier medical management and 
care coordination, infonnation from health insurance carriers is not available to quantify such 
differences. Therefore, the same estimated PMPM premium impact for each market was used across 
all health insurance carriers although the percent of premium would vary slightly across the 
individual, small group, and large group markets. 
MHCC has been charged with conducting a systematic assessment of potential changes in health 
beneﬁts through added mandates under Insurance Article §15-1501, Annotated Code of Maryland. 
Typically, MHCC would contract with an external actuarial consulting firm to complete the analysis 
and formulate estimates. Given the urgency of this legislative request and the current limits of the 
MHCC budget, an experienced actuary at MHCC conducted the work. I am satisﬁed that MHCC 
completed this analysis with similar rigor as if MHCC had contracted with an actuarial consultant. 
If you have any questions about these ﬁndings, please do not hesitate to contact me at 410-764-3566 
or hen.steffen@maryland.gov. 
Sincerely, 
ﬁ~J=?/-

Technical Attachment 
MHCC used the Maryland All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) as the data source for this analysis. 
Speciﬁcally, institutional services (outpatient only), professional services, and eligibility ﬁles were 
used. The APCD population includes all Maryland residents enrolled in private (commercial) fully- 
insured health plans. For purposes of this analysis, only the claims experience for females 30 years of 
age and older were selected from the APCD since the cost elimination would apply to that cohort. 
However, when calculating the per member per month (PMPM) costs, the entire fully-insured 
population (i.e., no age restriction), including the individual market, the small group market, and the 
large group market, was used to calculate member exposure. However, the insurance canier Kaiser 
(no fee-for-service claims for professional services due to capitation) and the Federal Employees 
Health Benefits (FEHB) Program (Federal decision to exclude all FEHB data from State APCDs 
including Maryland) populations were excluded in this study. Finally, the CPT and ICD codes used 
in this analysis included CPT: 76090, 76091, 76499, 76641, 77046, 77047, 77048, 77049, 77051, 
77061, 77062, 77065, 77066, 78800, G0279, G0204, GO206; and ICD 10: Z1231, N63, R92.0, 
R92.l, R92.2, R92.8. We excluded all mammogram CPT screening codes. These services are 
covered under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) list of essential health beneﬁts (EHB) and under 
preventive services for large fully-insured employers. 
About 33.8% (252,732 members per month on average) of the entire 2020 privately fully-insured 
population are female and are at least thirty years or older. Of that 33.8%, about 2.7% (or 6,908 
females per month on average) had a diagnostic imaging examination or diagnostic evaluation of the 
breast claim during 2020. These 6,908 females are about 0.9% of the entire fully-insured population 
in the APCD. 
In 2019, about 33.3% (255,1 16 members per month on average) of the entire privately fully insured 
population were female and at least thirty years or older. Of that 33.3%, about 3.1% (or 7,800 
females per month on average) had a diagnostic imaging examination or diagnostic evaluation of the 
breast claim during 2019. These 7,800 females are about 1.0% of the entire fully-insured population 
in the APCD.
