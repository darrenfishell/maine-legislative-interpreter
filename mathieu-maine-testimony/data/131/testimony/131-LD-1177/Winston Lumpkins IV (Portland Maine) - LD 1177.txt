Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing  Committee on Transportation,
I live in Portland, very near to a marina which hosts mega yachts.  Their size and 
obvious, palpable pollution has many effects on the area, from air-quality to the 
navigability of the area by fishing boats and recreational sail boats.  
The owners of these vessels can afford basically anything, as evidenced by their 
ownership of said vessels.  
Portland alone faces significant challenges in maintaining it's harbor- if we could 
benefit from the presence of these super yachts, as this bill would allow, that would be
a very welcome change. 
Thank you for considering this bill.
