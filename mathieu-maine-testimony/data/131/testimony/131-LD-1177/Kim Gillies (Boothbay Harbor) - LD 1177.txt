LD 1177
Dear Transportation Committee Members,
I am writing to express my opposition to LD No. 1177 An Act to Assess a Slip Fee on
Megayachts Registered in Overseas Tax Havens.  I urge you to reconsider this bill.  
This kind of fee can have devastating ripple effects on Maine's marine tourism.  These
yachts will most certainly choose not come to Maine and the other vessels they travel 
with that may be smaller in size (those under 100') will follow.  
These yachts come into our ports and generate good revenue for our towns.  They eat 
in our restaurants, purchase art in our galleries, take home unique gifts from our 
shops.  They tell their friends and colleagues about our beautiful coastal communities 
which inspires even more yachts to visit. The boating community is small and 
reputation means everything.  Currently Maine has the distinction of being a 
welcoming and beautiful place to visit.  This tax will be perceived as an insult and a 
money grab.  These boaters will be inclined to take their business elsewhere and skip 
Maine all together.  Word will spread and we will be judged as not welcoming to this 
community.
I urge you to reconsider this bill and it's effects on our coastal communities.
Respectfully,
Kim Gillies
Boothbay Harbor, Maine
