RE: LD1177 -An Act to Assess a Slip Fee on Megayachts  
 
Thank you for hearing my testimony opposing LD1177. I am respectfully submitting a position summary for 
your convenience and clarity. I am Vanessa Pike; I manage  Fore Points Marina  in Portland . We have 150-boat 
slips that accommodate local and visiting vessels from under 20 feet to 500+ feet  long. 12 slips are dedicated 
to megayachts  (vessels 100+ feet), so we have an understand ing of  this market and customer.  
 
Maine is a new and growing destination for megayachts . We spend a lot of time educating  captains and charter 
brokers about the  area as a premier  destination  to visit . A focus area is Newport, Rhode Island, a relatively 
nearby hub for megayachts . They have no dockage tax  and an ample inventory of customers seeki ng new 
adventures.  
 
But why do we care  or want to lure them to Maine ? We care because of the economic impact they generate for 
our neighbors. For our local community. One customer said they spend an average of $100,000 a week in any 
port.  
 
When yacht guests are on board, the guests spend money in town on dinners, activities, and entertainment. 
When the guests are away, the crew spends money in town on dinners, activities, and entertainment. The yachts 
replenish at each port . They patronize l ocal businesses.  For example, a  florist in town replaced all their covid -
canceled wedding business with decorating yacht interiors . A transportation business hired an additional driver 
just to service the yacht clientele at  our marina . 
 
I do not have a fir m statistic on total yacht spending in the state. I do however , have a key to the marina where 
we let in a myriad of businesses t hat generate revenue providing  products a nd services to these yachts. Just to 
name a few of our regulars:  
 
• Harmons & Barton’s F loral 
• Pratt Abbott Cleaners  
• VIP Charters  
• Atlantic Limo  
• Lady Catherine Lobster  
• Harbor Fish  
• Browne Trading  
• Summerfeet Cycling  
• Bow Street Beverages  
• Diver Lou   
• Sea Tow  
• Casco Bay Diesel  
• Portland Yacht Services  
• Maine Yacht Services  
• Hamilton Marine  

• DiMillos   
• Hallett Canvas  
• Rinaldi Fuel – family -owned  business that we buy tens of thousands of gallons of diesel  
 
A tax, one that they are not paying in the ir home port, or many others, and one that compounds so quickly as 
suggested in this bill, is not we lcoming. It targets them specifically and sends a message we do not want their 
business. It is not as simple as alleging “tax havens” and “they can register in the US” – these are global entities 
employing people from around the world  with maritime laws an d legalities to follow. T hey are not going to 
change their flag to visit Maine. They just won’t come to Maine.  
 
They can go anywhere in the world ; and w hile we try to entice them to spend their money here, we are at an 
unfair advantage to the plethora of other ports that are more welcoming. This “tax” will have the opposite 
effect of its intention. Rather than generating revenue for the state, it will decrease visitation and take money 
directly away from hard working small businesses and all those they emp loy. 
 
Thank you for considering the negative ramifications a bill such as this would have on our communities.
