I am against this bill. 
 
1. The problem with this bill is that it is an arbitrary tax against our customer base. 
There is no notice being given for this season coming up. Pricing has already been 
given to our customers. 
 
2. Also, the use of the tax being collected is not related to the industry that is being 
taxed. The tax proposes to take money from our maritime customers and use it to 
solve the stateâ€™s problem with affordable housing and homelessness. While also 
trying to address the states inadequacies with public transportation. To solve these 
problems, landlords and car owners should be taxed not boaters. Not pleasure boaters 
bringing lots of other revenue into our economy. 
 
3. This bill is wildly concerning and will not only effect marinas, but it will affect the 
entire economy of Maine. These yacht owners, guests, and crews that choose to stay 
at marinas and not on anchor eat in our restaurants, shop in our stores, and often 
return year after to enjoy our beautiful state. Why add a deterrent to something that is 
positive for our tourist dependent economy?
