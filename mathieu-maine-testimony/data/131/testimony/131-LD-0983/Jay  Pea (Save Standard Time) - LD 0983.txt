Committee on State and Local Government  
Maine Legislature  
Augusta , Maine  
 
Re: Yes on LD  983 – Permanent Standard Time is  best for health , safety , and prosperity.  
 
Dear Honorable Committee Members , 
 
Please support L D 983 , exemption from Daylight Saving Time (DST, false time)  and resto-
ration of per manent Eastern Standard Time  (EST, natural time ). Permanent EST is federall y 
approved , and it’s best for health, safety, education, economy, and civil liberties of school-
children, essential workers , and commuters . 
 
Scores of organizations —representing millions  of researchers, physicians,  teachers , par-
ents, journalists, and community leaders —oppose DST and endorse permanent Standard 
Time. Among these are  the American Medical Association , American Academy of Neu-
rology , American College of Chest Physicians, National Safety Council , American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine, National PTA , American College of Occupational & Environ-
mental Medicine, Start School Later, Canadian Sleep Society , Association of Canadian 
Ergonomists , editorial boards of Bloomberg , Star Tribune , Oregonian , Sun Sentinel , writ-
ers from Cato, Daily Wire , Breaking Points , and many more .[AASM] [AMA] [CSS] [SRBR]  
 
Permanent EST at Maine’s longitude is federally approved  by the Uniform Time Act  
(15 	USC §260a ); it can end clock change quickly , as most voters wish. It would  also keep 
sunrise before 8am , (when most school/work begins)[CDC][Silver ] for health, safety, and pros-
perity. Permanent Standard Time has been observed for decades  in Arizona, Hawaii , all 
five US territories, and most nations. Most of Mexico  restored permanent Standard Time 
last year , and more states have permanent Standard Time bills than ever before . Perma-
nent EST would protect start times for schoolchildren  and essential workers  (farmers , 
police, firefighters, commercial drivers, transit operators, healthcare personnel,  teachers ) 
by letting most sleep naturally past dawn  year-round .[Borisenkov] [Cell] [Schlanger] [Skeldon] Its benefits 
to circadian health would improve immunity, longevity, mood , alertness , and performance 
in school , sports , and work. It can prevent traffic deaths , lower crime , and reduce chronic 
illnesses .[AASM] [Juda] [SRBR] Standard Time is the natural clock, set to the sun.  
 
Other bills have considered permanent DST (also known as Atlantic Standard Time at 
Maine’s longitude) , but that is prohibited by the Uniform Time Act; it cannot end clock 
change quickly . It would  also delay sunrise in Portland past 8am  nearly all of December 
and January , as late as 8: 14am (it would delay sunrise later and longer in places further

US.[Ripley] [Sehlstedt] It would force constituents to wake an hour early  relative to solar time  every 
weekday all winter . Americans  rejected permanent DST in 1974 , and it has failed in several 
other years  and places .[BBC] [Congress ][Ripley] [Yorkshire] It would deprive morning ligh t needed by 
farmers , construction workers , and other outdoor labor ers.[Schlanger] It would revert benefits 
of starting school later .[Cell] [Skeldon] It would delay radio broadcasts  of morning news until 
most people have begun  work.[Stine] It would increase need for  morn ing heat  and evening 
air conditioning  in homes .[Kotchen] It would disrupt worship for those who pray daily at sun-
rise.[Agudath] Moving clocks to DST  acutely deprives sleep ; leaving clocks on DST  chronically 
deprives sleep  (average 19 minutes nightly).[Giun tella][Roenneberg] DST’s delay ed sunrise signif-
icantly increases accidents, disease  (cancer up 12–36%), and healthcare costs . It 
significant ly decreases  learning , productivity , and earnings  (wages down 3–5%).[Gibson]

Please hear the nonpartisan consensus of history and science . Save time, money, and lives. 
Please support LD 983 , exempt Maine from DST , and restore permanent ES T.

2/15/23, 3:33  PM Mexico falls back but won’ t spring forward as summer time abolished | Mexico | The Guardian
https://www .theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/mexico-votes-abolish-summer -time-daylight-savings 1/1Mexico falls back but won’t spring forward as summer time abolished
Congress votes to scrap daylight saving and just keep standard time, meaning end to changing clocks twice a year
Lillian Perlmutter in Mexico City
Thu 27 Oct 2022 05.30 EDT
Pedro López, an oﬃce worker in the Mexican state of Veracruz, gets up before dawn, and drives in
the moonlight an hour and a half to his job. “Leaving my house in the dark every single day and
driving under the moon is horrible, especially in a landscape as beautiful as Veracruz,” he said.
But, for half a year at least, he’ll be driving in the sunlight. Mexico’s congress voted on Wednesday to
abolish summer time, and when Mexicans set their clocks back this weekend, it will be for the last time.
In March, they will not be turned forward.
López is among the 40% of Mexicans who recent polls suggest support the change; 35% oppose the shift.
“I assume it depends on what kind of work schedule you have, but I think for the majority of us in the
middle class, returning to God’s schedule will be magniﬁcent,” López said. (In the winter months,
shorter days mean he’ll still have to make his commute in the dark.)
Mexico is just the latest in a string of countries, states and territories contemplating an end to the annual
round of “spring forward, fall back”.
One study, published by the National Autonomous University of Mexico, found that summer time only
saved the country 0.16% in energy costs per year, and led to various negative side eﬀects among the
population, such as diﬃculty paying attention at work and school.
While American summer time, called daylight saving time, runs from March to November, Mexico has
held summer time from March to October since 1996. This creates an odd purgatory for several weeks
every six months when Mexico City does not align with the Central Time Zone.
The outliers to Mexico’s schedule are the northern state of Sonora, which follows Arizona’s speciﬁc
schedule, and Quintana Roo, which keeps American daylight saving time to ease the experience of
tourists at Cancun resorts. These states will continue their current practices under the new law.
Adding another element of confusion into the new regulations, large cities that border the United States,
such as Juárez, Tijuana and Mexicali, will continue to use American daylight saving time to ease
commerce. Driving just several kilometers outside the city will set the clocks back an hour for half the
year.
Martha García, a massage therapist in Nuevo Laredo, one of the aﬀected cities, said the exception makes
sense, despite the inconvenient divide between urban and rural areas. “Of course it will aﬀect us,
keeping a diﬀerent time than the interior of the country, but it’s important to understand that our
everyday lives and work are already more connected to the United States.”
Bety Beza, an administrative worker in Monterrey, Nuevo León, said she thought summer time brought
zero advantages with its promise of more light. “It only made it so I had to wake up even earlier to work.
The new law won’t just aﬀect my life, it will beneﬁt my life,” she said.
1/10/23, 4:20 PM AMA calls for permanent standard time | American Medical Association
https://www .ama-assn.or g/press-center/press-releases/ama-calls-permanent-standard-time 1/1AMA calls for permanent standard time
NOV 15, 2022

AMA Media & Editorial
ph: (312) 464-4430
media@ama-assn.orgHONOLULU – At its Interim Meeting, the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates on
Monday supported ending daylight saving time and move permanently to standard time.
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and others pointed to the potential health bene ts of the
move.
“For far too long, we’ve changed our clocks in pursuit of daylight, while incurring public health and
safety risks in the process. Committing to standard time has health bene ts and allows us to end the
biannual tug of war between our biological and alarm clocks,” said AMA Trustee Alexander Ding,
M.D., M.A, MBA.
Although the chronic e ects of remaining year-round in daylight saving time (which shifts daylight
hours later in the evening) have not been well studied, sleep experts say that standard time (which
shifts daylight hours earlier in the morning) aligns best with human circadian biology. Data show
that the sudden change from standard time to daylight saving time in March is associated with
signi cant public health and safety risks, including increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events,
mood disorders, and motor vehicle crashes. Some studies suggest that the body clock does not
adjust to daylight saving time even after a few months.
This year, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to establish permanent daylight saving time, but there is a lot
of daylight between that version and the AMA-endorsed approach. The House has not taken up a bill
on the issue. Twenty states have endorsed year-round daylight saving time, but Congress must act
for the changes to take e ect.
“Eliminating the time changes in March and November would be a welcome change. But research
shows permanent daylight saving time overlooks potential health risks that can be avoided by
establishing permanent standard time instead,” Ding said. “Sleep experts are alarmed. Issues other
than patient health are driving this debate. It’s time that we wake up to the health implications of
clock setting.”
 
 
 
 
End the Switch and Support   
PERMANENT STANDARD TIME  
 
Every year, w e make the switch between standard time  and daylight saving time (DST) 
when we “fall back” to standard time in November and “spring forward” to DST in March. 
This annual switch is quite simply not good for our health. Data clearly show s that the 
abrupt change from standard time to DST in March is associated with significant 
public health and safety risks , including increased risk of adverse cardiovascular 
events, mood disorders, and motor vehicle crashes.  
 
It’s critical that we enact legislation to get rid of the switch between standard time and 
DST. However, permanent DST is not the answer. Instead, we should move to 
permanent standard time. Current evidence  supports the adoption of yea r-round 
standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct 
benefits for public health and safety.  This position is shared  by more than 20 medical, 
scientific, and civic organizations, including the American Academy of Sleep  Medicine, 
American Academy of Neurology, American College of Chest Physicians, American 
College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, National PTA, National Safety 
Council, Society for Research on Biological Rhythms, and World Sleep Society.  
 
DST has been shown to lead to chronic sleep deprivation amongst adults and 
adolescents.  Research has found  that adolescents get less sleep and had longer 
reaction times,  increased lapses in vigilance, and increased daytime sleepiness  
following the switch to DST. These effects are especially pronounced in children with 
autism who are especially susceptible to chronic sleep issues. Permanent standard time 
is the best option  for health.  
 
DST also leads to circadian misalignment - a mismatch in the timing between our 
biological clocks and our work, school, and sleep routines. This misalignment happens 
 
 when we are waking up in the dark  to go to work or school  or getting late evening light 
that can adversely affect the body’s ability to fall asleep by suppressing melatonin. 
Circadian misalignment has been correlated with detrimental health effects, including 
cancer, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative d isease. 
 
Congress previously enacted legislation to make DST permanent and repealed it 
less than a year later.  During the 1974 energy crisis , permanent DST was thought to 
save energy by  decreasing the need for electric lighting  in the evening . However, 
energy savings from DST appear negligible , as air conditioning needs often increase in 
the late afternoon in the summer and heating needs often increase in the morning in the 
winter. In addition, the dark mornings were very unpopular , with sunrise arriving in DC 
and New York around 8:30am and not until around 9am in Detroit and Indianapolis . 
Moreover, a number of children were fatally struck by cars as they made their way to 
school in the d ark. Permanent DST was repealed by Congress  less than a year after its 
implementation.  The House vote to end permanent DST was 383 -16 and the Senate 
agreed in a voice vote.   
 
AASM supports elimination of seasonal time changes in favor of a fixed, national,  year-
round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides 
distinct benefits for public health and safety.   For additional information contact Eric

SRBRTalkingPointsaboutDaylightSavingTime(DST)
The talking points are meant to briefly address some key points raised by the media and laymen responses per
Public Outreach Commi�ee (POC) of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR). This isbynomeans
the full scope of references, but we do have the key references, as well as the SRBR Posi�on Paper on DST
enclosed inthis press kitto support ourresponses tothe media. Please feel free to reach out to aSRBR POC at
srbroutreach@gmail.com in case you have any sugges�ons or comments.
WhydowecareaboutDaylight SavingTime(DST)?
Approximately 1.6 billion people worldwide change their clocks twice a year to and from DST. This on e-hour
changein clock �me to DST leads to decreased exposure to morning sunlight for some individuals (while DST is in
placeduring the summer months in the US). Our body's internal biological clock needs exposure to morning
sunlight to adjust to local �me. When the exposure to sunlight in the morning is reduced, our biological clocks
will dri� later and later, making it harder to wake up. The one-hour shi� in clock �me during DST
alsoexposes people to more evening light, which further pushes the biological clock to a later �me and makes it
more difficult to fall asleep. Because of the effect of reduced morning light and increased evening light on the
biological clock, DST leads to sleep loss and a mismatch between the body clock and local �me (also called social
jetlag). Both sleep depriva�on and social jetlag havenega�ve effects on physical and mental health, including
increased risks for diabetes, obesity, heart disease, depression, and some forms of cancer. Therefore,
keeping DST during summer or all year round in the US, will have serious implica�ons for public health and
safety. These nega�ve effects can be prevented by not switching to DST.
WhyispermanentDSTworsethanpermanentstandard �me?
DST means that we wake up in darkness and are exposed to more evening light, especially in the western parts of
each of the �me zones. Adhering to DST throughout the year would result in even more hours of morning
darkness during winter for many people. This makes waking up more difficult for everyone, from school kids to
adults, and is likely to worsen condi�ons such as seasonal affec�ve disorders. Darker mornings and brighter
evenings will push the circadian system later, and thus lead to later sleep �ming. However, work and school
hours do not change, so these later sleep �mes will result in more sleep depriva�on and social jetlag (internal
misalignment). As already men�oned, sleep depriva�on and social jetlag have nega�ve effects on physical and
mental health, including increased risks for diabetes, obesity, heart disease, depression, and some forms of
cancer. Brighter days and darker nights are cri�cal for a healthier popula�on year round. Thus, DST should be
abolished, and we as biological rhythms experts clearly favor permanent Standard Time (when the clock �mes
matches sun �mes).
Havewedonepermanent DSTbefore?
In 1974, the United States decided to try permanent DST for two years, in order to save energy. At first, people
were op�mis�c, with 79% in favor of the change. However, by February, a�er the first winter, support had
dropped to 42%. This change of mind is likely due to the fact that waking up in the dark is harder. Keeping DST
year-round also increases the dura�on of dark mornings in the winter! Most notably, energy savings were not
seen under this permanent DST in 1974. In fact, permanent DST in 1974 in the US didn't make it for full two
years: Congress rolled back the measure in a 383-to-16 vote, clearly demonstra�ng that this was a bad idea. Let's
not replicate the errors of the past!
IsanincreaseinexerciseduringDSTagoodreasonto s�cktopermanent DST?
Currently, DST occurs in spring, and ends a�er the summer. Those �mes of year are typically associated with more
outdoor ac�vi�es because of warmer temperatures. Although it has been argued that DST isassociated wit hmore
physical ac�vityduring the summer months, it is more likely that the change in season is responsible for changes
inphysical ac�vity pa�erns. It is also noteworthy that there is no direct evidence sugges�ng that permanent
DST would be beneficial for physical ac�vity during the winter months. Conversely, keeping Standard Time
throughout the year (rather than DST) will not affect the seasonality of warmer temperatures and longer
evening light insummer. Thus, it is unlikely that locking into Standard Time instead of DST will abolish the
posi�ve effects of exercise during the summer months.

Permanent daylight saving time: An idea whose time has not come again
Evidence is in short supply to justify the shift. 
By Editorial Board (https://www.startribune .com/editorial-bo ard/6390869/) Star Tribune  MARCH 26, 2022 — 6:00PM
Minnesotans' willingness to give permanent daylight saving time a try back in the 1970s was
understandable.
Consumers were reeling from that era's steep inflation. Energy prices were particularly painful,
with oil shortages the fallout from Middle East producers flexing their might.
No wonder 68% of those surveyed in a Minnesota Poll published Dec. 2, 1973, said they favored a
shift to year-round daylight saving time (DST). If a simple clock adjustment could reduce energy
demand and yield savings, why not give it a try? That same rationale led the U.S. Congress to pass
legislation to leave clocks one hour ahead year-round beginning in early 1974.
Three months after this shift, Minnesotans had had a major change of heart. In a Minnesota Poll
published March 20, 1974, 58% of those surveyed said they preferred standard time during the
winter.
That historical reality should throw cold water on ill-informed modern-day proposals for a
permanent DST shift.
If it didn't work in 1974, it's unclear why it would work now.
Yet there are bills with broad bipartisan support at the state and federal levels to make this
switch again. One of them, the "Sunshine Protection Act (https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-
congress/senate-bill/623?
q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22sunshine+protection+act%22%2C%22sunshine%22%2C%22protection
," cleared the U.S. Senate with little debate but unanimous consent on March 15. It would make
DST permanent beginning in 2023 (https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-
releases?id=B7EE5AB2-E909-49B3-B0DF-4F1DC0AB49C6) .
At the Minnesota Legislature, there are bills, SF 149 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?
b=Senate&f=SF0149&ssn=0&y=2021&keyword_type=all&keyword=daylight) and HF 72
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=HF72&y=2021&ssn=0&b=house) , calling for this as
well. Sen. Mary Kiffmeyer (https://www.senate.mn/members/member_bio.html?leg_id=15302) ,
R-Big Lake, has long been a champion (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?
b=Senate&f=SF0149&ssn=0&y=2021&keyword_type=all&keyword=daylight) of ending the current
"spring forward, fall back" clock shift. A companion bill in the House has a list of authors that
includes prominent DFLers and fiery conservatives.
5/7/22, 3:18 PM Permanent daylight saving time: An idea whose time has not come again - StarT ribune.com
https://www .startribune.com/permanent-daylight-saving-time-an-idea-whose-time-has-not-come-again/600159727/ 2/2The state legislation, if passed, would be dependent on a congressional approval, which is
sensible. Things would get confusing if Minnesota made this switch but other states did not.
Kiffmeyer's clock-flipping complaints are legitimate. The changes, as she said in a statement, are
linked to a "statistical rise in car crashes, days missed from work, heart attacks and workplace
injuries immediately surrounding the change. These issues emerge as a result of the sleep
disruption and a chaotic transition."
Ending the twice-a-year clock change merits serious consideration. But the state and federal bills
go beyond that to make DST permanent. That would be a mistake. If there is a shift, it should be
to standard time.
The Star Tribune's archives help explain why. The 1974 change went into effect on Jan. 6 that
year, trading darker mornings for afternoon daylight. On that day, the time change meant the sun
rose in Minnesota around 8:50 a.m. (https://sunrise-sunset.org/us/minneapolis-mn/2022/1)
By Jan. 16, the Star Tribune was reporting two accidents that may have been linked to the
unaccustomed morning darkness. In Duluth, a 3-year-old boy died when he and his mom were
struck returning from a bus stop. In Austin, a car hit a crossing guard and two elementary
students.
Parents were advised to add reflective materials to kids' coats. Local leaders called for later
school start times to protect kids. Reports released nationally suggested energy savings were
minimal. Not surprisingly, broad regret settled in. In October 1974, then-President Gerald Ford
signed legislation undoing (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/what-happened-the-
last-time-the-us-tried-to-make-daylight-saving-time-permanent-
180979742/#:~:text=In%20October%201974%2C%20President%20Gerald,planned%20two%2Dyear%20
the change.
As the current Congress weighs DST 2.0, health experts are speaking out. If there is a permanent
change, standard time is the clear choice. It provides more early daylight and most closely aligns
with the body's natural wake-work-sleep rhythms. Misalignment has been linked to "increased
cardiovascular disease risk, metabolic syndrome and other health risks,'' according
(https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8780) to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
Simply put, "It's better to have light in the mornings than the evenings," said Dr. Conrad Iber
(https://med.umn.edu/bio/dom-a-z/conrad-iber) , a sleep medicine physician at University of
Minnesota Medical School and M Health Fairview.
It's unclear why there's momentum this year behind the federal DST shift. A change that affects so
many requires thoughtful consideration and solid evidence to justify it.
So far, both are in short supply. A pause, at the very least, is timely and necessary.
