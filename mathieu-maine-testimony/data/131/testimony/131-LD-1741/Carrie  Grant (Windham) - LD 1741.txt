Good evening Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the 
education and cultural affairs committee, my name is Carrie Smalley and I live in 
Windham Maine. I am writing to you today in support of the bill where I believe taxes
should follow the student, and we need to lessen restrictions on charter schools for the
best educational opportunity for Families and Maine kids. Please support this bill as 
itâ€™s crucial for the future of Maine children
