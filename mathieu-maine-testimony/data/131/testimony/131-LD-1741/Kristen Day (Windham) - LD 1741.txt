Kristen Day
Windham
LD 1741
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural
Affairs Committee,
My name is Kristen Day and I'm a mother of three from Windham. I was born and 
raised in Maine, and have lived in Windham for over 20 years raising our family. It 
was an amazing place to raise a family until Janet Mills came in and spat on 
everything Mainers stand for. 
I am writing in support of LD 1741 and would ask that you please support this bill to 
provide families with the flexibility in education opportunity to make the best choices 
for their children. Taxes should definitely follow the child regardless of school 
choice. And Maine needs to relax the restrictions on Charter Schools so intellectual 
freedom and competition can result in the best education opportunity.
Maine's public education system is in crisis. Half of our town is opposed to the woke 
nonsense taking over, and unless you want Maine to end up like Oregon, Washington 
or California with businesses and residents fleeing, and homeless overflowing the 
streets, you should consider backing up toward the middle on some of these bills. This
radical agenda is not sustainable for Maine and my husband and I are left with little 
choice but to move; we can't be the only ones considering it.
Please vote yes on 1741!
Thank you for your consideration.
