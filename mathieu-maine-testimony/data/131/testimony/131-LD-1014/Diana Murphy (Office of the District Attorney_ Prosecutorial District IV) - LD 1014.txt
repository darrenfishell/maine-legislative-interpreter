RE: LD 1014, An Act Regarding Payments to Recipients of Restitution 
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Honorable members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Diana Murphy. I live in the city of Augusta. l am the legal restitution specialist at the 
Kennebec County District Attorney's Office, serving over twenty-three years. I am also a member of the 
board for the elder victim restitution Fund. 
We support this bill and strongly feel it will help make victims whole in a timelier manner. 
We are always striving to better serve our community. One of our biggest accomplishments is collecting 
restitution from state tax returns through the Maine Revenue Services, training the other District 
Attorneys ’ Ofﬁces. In the past four years our office has garnished $314,181.01 for the victims of crime, 
from those convicted individuals who have failed to pay their court-ordered restitution. 
This year alone we have requested $3,471,955.43 in state tax returns for victims. 
Another accomplishment is our online Credit/ Debit ca rd system, making it easier for those convicted 
individuals to pay their court-ordered restitution, donation, or supervision fees. In the past three years, 
we have collected $105,000.00 from this service alone. To avoid confusion, our office provides those 
convicted individuals with a form at sentencing, instructing exactly where to make their payments, and 
what type of payment is accepted.
I work closely with Probation and Parole at maintaining accurate restitution balances. Pursuant to 17-A 
§2011 Former Dept. of Correction. Probation sends our ofﬁce a written notice of release when the 
defendant has defaulted in restitution payment, so our Ofﬁce can enforce these payments-pursuant to 
17-A §2015(3)-Default. lt is already in statute that our ofﬁce will enforce defaulted payments aftera 
defendant is released, so let us make the necessary changes, making it crystal clear the defendant is to 
continue paying the attorney of the state who prosecuted the case upon completion of their probation period and 
or iail sentence. This will allow for immediate action on defaulted payments. We are asking to include an 
additional amendment to 17-A§ 2011 At the time of reiease from Probation and or the Department of 
Corrections, the offiee of Probatien must provide a written notice of release to the convicted 
individual, attorney for the $tete who prosecuted the case, and the victim. That way everyone is 
notiﬁed and there is absolutely no confusion. 
Restitution is a very important part of the criminal justice system. It helps to rehabilitate convicted 
individuals and make victims whole monetarily. We are also asking to include an addition amendment to 
15 MRSA §5826(6). Criminal Forfeiture. Specifying of eeeh seized/forfeited less any outstanding 
restitution, which must be sent to the ofﬁce of the attorney for the State who prosecuted the case. We 
can all do more to improve restitution, to better serve our community. Let us light the ﬁre within us to 
make victims whole in a timelier manner. Let's make the necessary changes. This is not about who's not 
doing their job; this is about the victims and making them whole. l hope by bringing awareness of these 
much—needed statutory changes, that you, our representatives, will approve them for the better of the 
victims in our great state of Maine. 
l look forward to answering any questions and l am available for the work session. Thank you for your 
support. 
The following is a list of the statutory changes and the reasons l feel these changes should be made.
