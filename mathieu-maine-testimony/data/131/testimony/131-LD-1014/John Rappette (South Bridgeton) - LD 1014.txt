RE: LD 1014, An Act Regarding Payments to Recipients of Restitution 
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Honorable members of the Criminai 
Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is John Rappette. I live in the town of South Bridgeton; I am the owner of Rappette 
Hood Corporation. I was a victim of a theft crime. 
I support this bill and feel that victims will be made whole in a timelier manner than iwas. It has 
been seventeen years since the incident happened and I am still at a loss and have not been
' 
;:=ai<:i in fuil. 
On March 8, 2006, my vehicle was stolen. The criminal led the police on a high-speed chase 
which resulted in a crash. The criminal was charged with Aggravated Criminal Mischief. Criminal 
Speed, OUI and eluding an officer. The court ordered the defendant to serve 14 days in jail,1 
year probation and to pay restitution to me in the amount of $8,550.00." € 
I feel I have been victimized not only by the defendant but by the system. I have made 
countless calls to Probation and Parole; they did not collect any restitution. I contacted the 
District Attorney Office and spoke with Ms. Diana York (now Murphy) She informed me she 
would ﬁle a motion to return the defendant to court. This was unsuccessful because the 
defendant moved out of State and her hands were tied. She suggested I should speak with an 
Attorney, which I did Mr. Regan Sweeney, Portland Maine. He tracked the defendant down in 
Ohio and was able to collect $3,800.00. The defendants ’ last payment was in April of 2020. 
Of the total $8,550 the defendant was ordered to pay, he paid $2,485 to the DA's Office and 
another $3,800.00 through my lawyer, for a total of $6,285, leaving $2,265 unpaid. it cost me 
$2,533.33 in legal fees to be able to collect the court ordered restitution that was due to me. 
feel this is due to me because ofthe broken system not holding defendants accountable for 
their crimes.
