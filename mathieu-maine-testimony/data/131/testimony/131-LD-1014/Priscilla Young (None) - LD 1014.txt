RE: LD 1014, An Act Regarding Payments to Recipients of Restitution 
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Honorable members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Priscilla Young, I am a victim of a theft crime, I am in favor of Bill LD # 1014, by this amended 
bill I feel that victims can be made whole in a timelier manner than I was. 
On September 02, 2011, my home was broken into by my son-in-law and his two friends. l had over 
$35,000.00 worth of property and jewelry stolen, But the defendants were only ordered to pay me back 
$15,176.00. It has been twelve years now and I am still waiting to be paid the remaining $4,061.25 
outstanding. I have been calling probation and the District Attorney's Ofﬁce for yeafrs in hopes ofa 
payment. One defendant was released, the other two are still on probation. 
This was to be my back up money, I will be eighty years old in two months, I sure could use iﬂnow. This 
doesn't count the mental grief which I still have, I don't feel comfortable to leave, my windows open and 
have my doors double locked, it's a hard way to live. 
Defendants should not be released from probation if they owe any outstanding restitution. Defendants 
should be forced to make monthly payments of more than just $25.00. If the Defendant does get 
released, then Probation should send notice to the victims and the State's Attorney's office who 
prosecuted the case and finish paying any outstanding restitution to the State who prosecuted the case 
so they can enforce payments. I speak for myself and those victims out there who have not been paid in 
a timely manner, this system is broken and needs to be ﬁxed.
