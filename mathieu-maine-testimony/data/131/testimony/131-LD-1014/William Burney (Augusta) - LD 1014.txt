RE: LD 1014, An Act Regarding Payments to Recipients of Restitution 
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Honorable members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is William Burney. I have been a resident of Augusta for most of my life; at one point serving 
as Mayor. 
A few years ago a vacant house that my sister and l owned was broken into. Things were stolen and 
damage was done. 
The criminals were apprehended, tried, and convicted. 
I attended the sentencing hearing and the judge recognized me for a statement. 
l asked for some leniency in the sentence so that the chances of recovering my restitution would be 
greater. He agreed and imposed a lighter sentence, probation, and a restitution order. 
While under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections - where I am sure that the staif to the 
probationer ratio is well out of balance - l received sporadic restitution payments, with the probationer 
periodically needing to be reminded of his obligation. 
Since the restitution has come under the jurisdiction of the Kennebec County District Attorney, the 
payments have been regular, along with accounting correspondence. This accounting is very important 
because it gives the victim an ongoing and hopefully final record that the restitution portion of the 
sentence is in compliance. 
I support these proposed amendments that will insure that victims get paid in as timely manner as 
possible. 
ﬁnk you.
