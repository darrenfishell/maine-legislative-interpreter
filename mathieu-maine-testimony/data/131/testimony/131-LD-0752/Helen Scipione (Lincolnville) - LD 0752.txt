Testimony of Helen Scipione, 
LD752, An Act to Expand Access to Banking Services for Minors, 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial 
Services 
March 9, 2023 
My name is Helen Scipione and I am the teaching principal at BCOPE, the alternative 
high school program at RSU71. Prior to BCOPE I have worked in alternative ed for over 
thirty three years. Many of our students work and many of them are not able to either 
cash their checks and have a safe place to keep their money. Many of them are 
unaccompanied youth. They are not able to get bank accounts because they didn't have 
a trusted adult to co-sign for them. Because of this they are unable to cash their checks 
and keep their money in a safe space like a bank. We have high expectations for our 
students pertaining to their attendance and academics and we very much encourage self 
responsibility, including financial responsibility. By passing this bill it would be just 
another stepping stone in the direction of independence, self stability, and 
responsibility. Thank you for the time to listen to my testimony.
