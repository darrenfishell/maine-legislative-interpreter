To the members of the committee: 
I am a mental health case manager for youth and adults within the state of Maine. I’ve worked 
with a lot of youth who have a very difficult time meeting their basic needs due to not having 
access to their own bank accounts. There are many reasons a child would not want to have a 
parent on their bank account. Some I have seen have included: there were realistic concerns 
about parents using their money without their permission for inappropriate reasons; their parents 
are unable to open an account at local banks due to owing them money; and they don’t live with 
their parents due to abuse, neglect, family conflict, or several other reasons. Not having access 
to their own funds electronically then leads to issues managing their finances in today’s 
electronic world. It is more difficult or impossible to pay bills with cash (i.e.- drivers ed, phone 
bill, car insurance, etc.) without access to a bank account. It adds steps to getting paid from vs. 
direct deposit. 
In my experience, most banks will not allow minors to open accounts with an adult outside of 
their legal guardian. We trust kids to drive and allow them to earn money, we should trust them 
to learn to manage their money responsibly. 
Thank you for your consideration,
