To whom it may concern: 
My name is Ben Harvey and | am a junior at BCOPE, the alternative high school, RSU 71 
district. | wanted to write this testimony to tell my experience. Last fall | earned 10 paychecks, | 
had nowhere to put them. | was worried | would lose this money if | just left them in my wallet. | 
wanted to make a bank account but they said | had to have a cosigner who was of the age 18 or 
older. At the time, | did not have a good relationship with my parents, so they were not available 
to ask. | was eventually able to open up a bank when my teaching principal went and talked to 
the bank. 
Sincerely, 
(2 â€œATam, Hoarey
