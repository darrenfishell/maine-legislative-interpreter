 Testimony of Senator Dave LaFountain introducing 
 LD 47,  An Act to Amend the Law Governing Licensing  Actions of the 
 Emergency Medical Services' Board 
 before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
 February 1, 2023 
 Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Esteemed Members of the Joint Standing 
 Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, my name is Dave LaFountain. I have the honor of 
 representing the good people of Senate District 16, including the towns of Albion, Fairfield, Oakland, 
 Waterville, and my hometown of Winslow. Today, I am pleased to introduce LD 47,  An Act to Amend the 
 Law Governing Licensing Actions of the Emergency Medical Services' Board 
 LD 47 is a department bill from the Maine Department of Public Safety. This bill amends the law 
 governing licensing actions of the Emergency Medical Services' Board to remove a reference to the 
 revocation of a license. It seeks to remove language, specifically two words, that should’ve been removed 
 last session. The current language creates ambiguity that this bill would resolve and allow the department 
 to operate more efficiently. 
 As a former fire chief and EMT, I know the importance of having effective operations in your department. 
 The work these first responders do deserves the enhanced clarity that this bill before you provides. 
 Thank you for the opportunity to present this bill. A representative from Maine EMS is here as well to 
 answer questions, but I’m happy to answer any questions the committee may have.
