Presented by Senator LaFountain of Kennebec 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC 
SAFETY 
Public Hearing: February 1, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety: 
My name is Sam Hurley and I am the Director of Maine Emergency Medical Services, Maine 
EMS, within the Department of Public Safety. I am testifying on behalf of Maine Department of 
Public Safety and Maine EMS in support of LD 47, "An Act to Amend the Law Governing 
Licensing Actions of the Emergency Medical Services ’ Board.” 
In the First Regular Session of the 1293‘ Legislature, this Committee passed LD 1724, “An Act to 
Amend the Maine Emergency Medical Services Act of1982 and Related Provisions. ” The bill 
was ultimately passed and signed into law. The bill summary, as amended by the committee, 
explicitly noted that the legislation Was intended to, “give[s] the Emergency Medical Services 
Board the authority to deny or refuse to renew an emergency medical services person license or 
revoke a license. ” .

Prior to this legislation, the Board could not revoke a license but instead had to request the AG 
ﬁle a complaint in District Court to revoke. The language from the 129th Legislature aligned the 
Maine EMS Board’s authority with other licensing boards by giving it authority to revoke. It 
appears that the clause in section 90-A (4) D, that says, “or revocation, ” was inadvertently 
overlooked during that statutory change as it continues to reference the historic revocation 
pathway.~ 
This legislation is intended to ensure that the entire EMS Act is in aligmnent and the EMS Board 
retains the authority to revoke licenses like all other licensing Boards. 
I am more than happy to answer any questions that you may have at this time, but please feel free 
to reach out to me anytime if there is any additional information that I can offer you and/or the 
Committee. 
Thank you.
