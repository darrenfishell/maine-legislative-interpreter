The "An Act to Provide for Safe Roadway Construction Design Criteria" bill is a step 
towards improving transportation safety and infrastructure for pedestrians and 
bicyclists in Maine. By adopting rule
standards for pedestrian facilities and bicycle facilities to create more sidewalks, 
crosswalks, bike lanes, and other safety measures, this bill addresses the needs of 
those who rely on non-motorized (or active) transportation. This will not only 
improve safety, but also encourage more people to use alternative modes of 
transportation, ultimately reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.
Additionally, this bill encourages the development of complete streets, which are 
designed to be safe and accessible for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, and 
motorists. Complete streets take into account the needs of all users, including those 
with disabilities, and promote a healthier, more sustainable transportation system. By 
investing in these infrastructure improvements and standards, Maine can create a safer
and more equitable transportation system that benefits everyone, regardless of their 
mode of transportation.
