South Portland
LD 1711
My name is Colleen Sumner. Today I am writing in support of LD1711’s goal of 
establishing safe roadway construction design criteria.
I live in South Portland. I work in Portland. Our family has one car but I do not drive 
it to work because parking is so expensive. Sometimes I get a ride into Portland and 
get dropped right at my job or somewhere else downtown and then I walk. Sometimes
I take the bus and walk from the bus stop to my job. Sometimes I bike or walk all the 
way into Portland, depending on the weather, using bike paths where I can to avoid 
the streets. My commute can take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour and half 
depending on the method … is the bridge up, is the bus late, did I walk, etc. The 
neighborhood I live in is Ferry Village. However, there is no longer a ferry to 
Portland or to anywhere.
But, whether it be for work, shopping, school, doctor’s appointments, or fun, my 
fellow travelers and I require good, safe and reliable options - not only to go from city
to city, but also to get around safely and efficiently within our own communities. 
Some of us have access to cars, some of us do not. Some of us cannot walk or bike an 
hour to work, some of us can. Some of us might have to spend an hour or more 
traveling several miles through the city, from bus to bus, while other people might 
hop in the car and drive to the same place in minutes. We are all different and, as 
such, we actually all use the roads differently. For this reason, a bill like LD1711 is so
important. The more open the entire process is, the more voices will be able to 
contribute, bringing new ideas and perspectives, and helping to rethink some of our 
old assumptions on roadway use to increase the overall quality of life, beauty and 
vitality of our cities and towns for the greatest number of people.
