Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation,  
My name is Zoe Miller and I facilitate the Moving Maine Network. We are a multi-sector, 
statewide collaborative working to ensure all Mainers have access to transportation regardless 
of background, destination, or geography. I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1711: 
An Act to Provide for Safe Roadway Construction Design Criteria.  
Increasing safety on Maine’s roads and sidewalks is a top priority for the Moving Maine 
Network. We are deeply concerned about vulnerable users -- people traveling outside of a 
motor vehicle. – who are more likely to be children, older adults, people with disabilities, and 
people with low incomes. Very often, they are walking, bicycling, or wheeling out of necessity, 
because they cannot drive or cannot afford to have a vehicle. The good news is that making it 
safer for our most vulnerable community members makes it better for all of us. 
Moving Maine is grateful that MaineDOT has a Complete Streets policy in place. However, we 
are concerned that implementation is not happening as comprehensively or expeditiously as it 
should be. We hear frequently from our members about the need for more widespread traffic 
calming and safety measures. One Moving Maine member who has a disability describes how 
she must ask for a ride to her bank, two blocks from her home, because the crossing on the 
major road is not safe for her to cross given her slow walking pace. This kind of story happens 
across Maine, and it must be addressed. 
Moving Maine supports LD 1711 because we believe it provides the needed transparent and 
clear guidelines to enable Maine to fully implement its Complete Streets policy. The result will 
be the design and implementation of safety measures for all roadway users. 
 
 
Sincerely,  
Zoe Miller, Facilitator, Moving Maine Network
