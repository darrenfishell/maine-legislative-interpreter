LD 1711
Hello Legislators,
I urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD1711. Our family of four moved to Portland 
as it was one of the safest places in the state to walk and ride bikes as primary forms 
of transportation. Even here, the standards for what constitutes a bike lane or a safe 
crosswalk are insufficient. It’s a shame that we have such unsafe roads, which take 
our greatest public asset and devote them to cars. I hope that we can do better here in 
Maine, that more places embrace walking and biking, and that it gets safer 
everywhere. 
Also, I’ve noted that MaineDOT has testified against a number of the bills before this 
committee, ensuring us that they’ve got the expertise and authority to solve pedestrian
and bicycle safety challenges. This is obviously not the case. Our 1960s-era road 
design and cars-first prioritization has created the unsafe street conditions we suffer 
from today. I’ve lost confidence that MaineDOT will ever put the needs of 
pedestrians and cyclists (let alone public transportation) above private cars. Private 
cars should be the lowest priority use of the public right-of-way, after pedestrians, 
cyclists, public transportation, and deliveries. This is how Finland cut emissions, 
traffic, noise, and road maintenance expense. It works, if we have the courage to try.
Best,
Myles Smith
