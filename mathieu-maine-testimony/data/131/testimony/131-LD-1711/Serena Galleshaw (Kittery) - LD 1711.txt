LD 1711
Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation,
My name is Serena and I live in Kittery. Roads in Maine aren't safe for everyone 
unless we design them to be so. We're really good at designing for winter plowing. I 
support LD 1711, An Act to Provide for Safe Roadway Construction Design Criteria 
because we can do better for the people of Maine by designing for the safety of all 
users, walkers and bikers included. Look to other snowy counties, states, and cities 
around the world to see how snow/seasons and safe streets can get along.
