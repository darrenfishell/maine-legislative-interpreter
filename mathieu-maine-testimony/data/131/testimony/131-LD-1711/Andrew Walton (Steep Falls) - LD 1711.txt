Andrew Walton
Steep Falls
LD 1711
Hello members of the Transportation Committee,
My name is Andrew Walton from Steep Falls(Standish), and I am in support of LD 
1711.
The bill is well written and provides specific instructions for the MDOT. 
One example I'd like to share is in Standish on Route 25 through our "downtown" 
district we have incomplete sidewalks. We literally have sidewalks to nowhere. 30ft 
of sidewalk, 100ft without, back to 20ft of sidewalk etc. In the "downtown" we have 
one crossing at the Hannaford plaza. To sum this up we have a broken sidewalk 
system, it is unsafe, not useable, and looks ridiculous to anyone passing by. Route 25 
gets over the 10k car mark easily and my hope is that since the town of Standish has 
tried and tried again to make these connections that the MDOT will make this happen 
when doing projects to the road for bike/ped users. This bill is a great step in getting 
complete streets where they are needed the most. 
Thank you for your time,
Andrew Walton
