LD 1711
Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation,
My name is Jordan Frazin and I live in Kittery. 
As a Maine resident, and someone who regularly travels local roads on my bicycle, I 
wanted to write in support of LD 1711. Depending upon the season, I spend upwards 
of 12 hours per week on my bike in the York county area - both for recreation and 
commuting to work. As such, I've had many close calls with vehicles, and it's 
something I think about every single time I step onto my bike. At this point, I've 
personally invested in a bike-mounted rear-radar which alerts me to unseen traffic 
coming from behind, and I feel irresponsible leaving the house for a ride without it (as
do many cyclists I've spoken with, and the growing handful of my friends who have 
been hit by vehicles). In addition to this, I'll often travel several miles out of my way 
to find the safest roads possible between my home and destination.
I truly believe that a significant amount of these close calls could have been avoided 
with some additional thought and investment put into the wellbeing of cyclists and 
pedestrians, and I urge you to support this bill.
Not only would safer cycling infrastructure result in increased quality of life for 
Maine residents such as myself, but equally as importantly, it moves us toward a 
future wherein we have a greater chance of meeting our global climate targets.
Thank you.
