 Senator Chipman, Representa�ve Williams, and Dis�nguished Members of the Transporta�on 
Commitee:  
My name is Anne Gass and I’m wri�ng to urge you to pass  LD 1711, An Act to Provide for Safe 
Roadway Construc�on Design Criteria.  
I’ve lived in Gray for 35 years and  have been ac�ve in town government in a number of ways; 
serving on a compre hensive plan commitee, the school board, establishing and chairing a Bike -
Ped Commitee from 2012 -2018, where we wrote the Gray Bike -Ped Plan and dra�ed a 
Complete Streets Policy, both subsequently adopted by the Town Council . I also served on the 
Town Council  from 2019 to 2022. My tes�mony is from my perspec�v e, not the Town ’s. 
Gray ’s current popula�o n is es�mated at just over 8,300. We have three major state roads 
(Routes 100, 115/202 , and 26) as well as the Maine turnpike carving through our community . 
People  within and outside of Gr ay commute to work and shopping on the state roads, as well as 
to the La kes district and t o ski mountains to the north. While access to these transporta�on 
corridors pose s some advantages , there is signiﬁcant traﬃc  impact as well  that aﬀects residents 
who live on those roads, as well as bikers and pedestrians. In par�cular, state route s 100 and 
115/202 bisect our village  center, making walking and biking unatrac�ve and unsafe. A rgua bly, 
we have two of the most confusing and dangerous intersec�ons in southern Maine in our 
village .  
Gray has done a lot of strong planning that is founda�onal to reclaiming our community from 
vehicles . We can ’t fully implement th ese plans, however, without cooper a�on from MaineDOT. 
We are currently collabora�ng with Main eDOT on two projects in our village and  have a third  
planned for a sec�on of Rte 26 north of the village . My impression is that MaineDO T views its 
mandate  primarily as helping more vehicles move through our town as fast  as possible , which is 
an�the�cal to the quality of life of our residents  and the interests  of businesses. In the 35 years 
I’ve lived in Gray MaineDOT has worked to widen traﬃc lanes through our town and has paid 
almost no at en�on to bike and pe destrian safety . I’m including some photos that illustrate the 
reali� es of what MaineDOT  road s look  like in Gray . In Figure 1, of Gray Village, the second image 
represents the changes the  Town would like to see happen.  The ﬁrst image shows our current 
reality : 
• Wide road lanes that lengthen the distance bikers and pe destrians must cross in order to 
safely cross streets;  
• Wide -angle turns that can be taken at high er spe eds than i f vehicles needed to slow to 
navigate a 90-degree  turn;  
• Inadequate or non -existent sidewalks  and bike lanes .  
The proposed reconstruc�on would square up the intersec�ons so that they are sane  and easily 
navigable by vehicles, bikers , and pedestrians .

 In the 35 years that I ’ve lived in Gray, we have seen very litle business develo pment in the 
village, and the exis�ng businesses struggle because of the lack of bike -ped safety . There is 
limited  parking, so even if those who  drive to the village  ﬁnd walking to local businesse s unsafe 
and unatrac�ve.  
 
Figure  1 
The photos below  illustrat e the state of sidewalks in parts of Gray Village . MaineDOT ’s historic 
over  emphasis on vehicular traﬃc o ver the needs of bike rs and pedestrians is destruc�ve to our 
community and to the town ’s desire to focus greater economi c growth in o ur Village center  (the 
later is documented in our 2020 Comprehensive Plan, approved by almost 80% of voters ).

In Figure 2 the inadequate sidewalk on Main Street narrows down to nothing  by the end of the 
building . At that point bikers and pedestrians must compete with traﬃc rushing to the turnpike  
interchange s a short way ahead. In Figure 3, also on Main Street, how is a person in a 
wheelchair , or a parent pushing a child in a stroller,  supposed to navigate that sidewalk?  
  
     Figure 4 
 
Figure 4 shows 
another view of our 
village, and a detail of 
the inadequate 
sidewalk  arrangement 
on the corner of Main Street and Yarmouth 
Rd. (115). Again, how 
is this safe for a person with a mobility 
disability, or young 
children ?

Figure 5 
Figure 5 shows a very narrow sec�on of 
sidewalk on Main Street in Gray that is almost lost in  vast c urb cut s, and which 
is right on the s treet with  only a slight 
distance  from cars racing through the 
intersec�ons at spee ds up to 40-50mph.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
We can do beter. We have exis�ng  plans that will help  us achieve beter resu lts for all users of 
Gray  village, not just vehicles . The Town of Gray  has brought - and is willing to con�nue to 
commit - signiﬁcant staﬀ and ﬁnancial resources to rebuilding our vi llage  and making our roads 
safe for all users. But we can ’t do it alone . MaineDOT must be an equal partner in this eﬀort.  
LD 1711 wou ld require M aineDOT to work with  communi�es like Gray on transporta�on 
projects that will strengthen our community and lead to stronger economic  growth in the area 
of town in which  it ought to occur, but where it is currently inhibited by the ﬂawed 
transporta�on priori�es of the past.
