  Dear Senate Chair Carney , House Chair Moonen, and Judiciary  Committee members , 
 Resolve New England (RNE) is a non- profit organization that provides emotional support, resources 
and advocacy for ALL those in New England that are dealing with fertility and family building  
challenges . RNE strongly supports  LD 1906 -  An Act to Enable Conf irmatory Adoption and 
respectfully urges you to advance the bill as “ought to pass”.  
 Maine  has been a leader in parentage, which is the  legal  parent -child  relationship. LD 1906 would 
continue this, by  streamlin ing the adoption process for couples who planfully  built  their families 
through assisted reproduction  technology  (ART), such as in -vitro fertilization. A parent who is not  
genetically connected to their child  may find themselves in the difficult situation of having to seek a 
decree to adopt their own child. This particularly impacts LGBTQ parents  who often r ely on ART to 
grow their families . LD 1906 is a practical provision that will make the adoption process  in Maine  
more efficient  and accessible  for people tha t are already legal parents . 
 Representative  Moonen , thank you for your leadership  in filing  this vital  bill to help families , and 
thank you to the entire committee for your consideration of my testimony . RNE looks forward to 
assisting in any way we can .  
 Sincerely,  
 
Kate Weldon LeBlanc  
Executive Director
