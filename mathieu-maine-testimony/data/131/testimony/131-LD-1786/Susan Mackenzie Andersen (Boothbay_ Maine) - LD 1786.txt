Tes�mony on LD 1786  
 
My name is Susan Mackenzie Andersen. I am a member of the Boothbay Community School 
District where I attended school through grade 12, graduating in 1966. My parents moved to the region in 1952 to establish a small free enterprise business, Andersen Design, that designed and made ceramics and taught those skills on the job to the women who used to work in the fish packing industry. The original school charter, which is now being repealed and replaced, was created in 1953. 
I am also an indepen dent researcher, and have studied the Maine economic development policy 
put into place in 1976 which I submit is the driving force behind the repealing and replacing of 
the Community School Districts local charter with state law. Laws cannot be understood on a stand -alone basis but must be considered in their larger context. I have been narrating the story 
of Maine’s incremental transition from a Home Rule State in 1969 to a centrally managed corporate state in 2023. I publish the Substack Newsletter, The Individual vs the Empire . 
 My testimony is complex and so I feel it is best submitted in written form but would like to speak briefly about it so that people will know it is here.  
I attended the publicized first meeting about the school charter after I saw a public announcement in the Boothbay Register. Present were the Town selectmen of Boothbay and Boothbay Harbor, a representative board, and my sister and myself. No one acknowledged our presence. The discussion centered around minor changes that become necessary with the passage of time such as adjusting appropriated funds for inflation. After that meeting I did not see further announcements about the school charter discussion. 
The district school committee members used “repeal and replace” to describe what they are 
doing with the Boothbay school charter. The new school charter as written for the towns of Boothbay and Boothbay Harbor repeals our local school charter and replaces it with state statutes, particularly Title 20 -A, chapter 105.  
The abandonment of our local school chart er is a undervaluation of the importance of home rule 
and a disservice to the community school district as Title 20, chapter 105, subchapter 4, §1752. Districts formed by private and special Acts of the Legislature, states the following:  
§1752. Districts formed by private and special Acts of the Legislature If the 
provisions of this chapter conﬂict with the provisions of any priva te and special Act of 
the Legislature which created a community school district, then the provisions of the 
private and special Act shall control.   [PL 1981, c. 693, §§ 5, 8 (NEW).]  
That means, consistent with home rule, that local communities have the ri ght to decide whether 
they will be governed by the rules in the state educational staute or establish our own rules.  
 
Tes�mony on LD 1786  
Title 20 -A, chapter 105 was codified in 1981, Apparently no one questioned if it is consistent 
with Municipal Home Rule which uses the words “ The inhabitants of any municipality shall 
have the power to alter and amend their charters on all matt ers, not prohibited by Constitution or 
general law, which are local and municipal in character .” I question that Title 20 -A, Chapter 105 
is consistent with the spirit and intention of Home Rule as it seems that the inhabitants of the 
community have a limited voice in what happens in their public school system in Title 20, Chapter 105 but they are the primary in the Home Rule Amendment.  The remedy to the disenfranchisement of local inhabitants in the statutes is to write a local school charter that protects  the community from political dangers written into the state educational 
statutes but instead the Boothbay community school district has simply repealed our existing charter and replaced it with the state statutes. Since the Legislature must approve all ch arter 
changes, the question to ask is, once we repeal our local school charter, established in 1953, can we ever get it back?  
So now let’s get down to the real nitty gritty LD 1786 begins by stating Sec. 1. P&SL 1953, c. 156, as amended by P&SL 2019, c. 11, §§1 
to 3, is repealed 3 and the following enacted in its place: 4 Sec. 1 to 3  
I could not find the former sec tions so I put in a request at the Maine Law Library.  
Next:  
LD 1786  Sec. 1.  Organiza�on and con�nued existen ce. The Boothbay -Boothbay 
Harbor Community School District, referred to in this Act as "the community school 
district," is a community school district organized pursuant to the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 20 -A, 7 chapter 105 and this Act to provide publi c educa�on in grades 
prekindergarten or kindergarten to grade 12 for the Town of Boothbay and the Town 
of Boothbay Harbor. The community school district is governed by Title 20 -A, chapter 
105 except as provided by this Act .  
In the public forum provided by the Boothbay Register, I have asked the Boothbay district school 
committee members if they are planning on a demonstration and research school, as established in H.P. 1845 as schools for which the standard rules of public education are waived and they can 
invent their own rules. No answer has been given as members insist it is inappropriate  to discuss 
the matter in a public forum (Boothbay Register comments). However, the Maine School Law 
Advisory says that “a result of not being solely representatives is that school boards are not 
required to let members of the public speak at its meetings…..Stated simply, the rights of voters in a school unit are (1) to watch the school board meet when it is in public session (2) to vote for  
school board members, and (3) to vote on the school budget and referenda.  
Pursuant to my question we have to see where the exceptions lie in this Act. The words “The community school district is governed by Title 20- A, chapter 105 except as provided by this 
Act.” confirms that the new Boothbay School Charter is intended to accommodate demonstration-  research schools, since Title 20 -A represents the general rules that apply to the 
public educational system, and the new charter codifies exceptions to the general rules.  
Tes�mony on LD 1786  
LD 1786  Sec. 2. Governance transi�on . The district school commitee members and 
the trustees of the community school district serving as of the eﬀec�ve date of this 
Act shall con�nue in their oﬃces for their respec�ve remaining terms.  
Except for the heading “Governance transition.” That seems like what is said doesn’t need to be 
said. It’s the normal state of affairs to serve a complete term. The heading implies there is some 
other sort of transition taking place but the text does not tell us anything about that transition. Par for the course, the district school committee will tell the public only what it chooses and so it is fair for members of the school district to read between the lines and connect dots to construct a probable picture of what is underway.  
Sec. 3. Board of trustees; district school commitee . Except as provided by  this Act, 
the board of trustees and district school commitee have the du�es and authority 
pursuant to the Maine Revised Statu tes, Title 20 -A, chapter 105 . The board of 
trustees may act as a building and facilities governing committee, including authori ty 
in consultation with the district school committee over the budget for maintaining, 
repairing, replacing and improving the community school district's buildings and 
other facilities and over the district's capital reserve funds.  The community school 
district may vote in accordance with Title 20 -A, sec�on 1651, subsec�on 4 to have 
the district school commitee perform the du�es of the board of trustees. (emphasis 
added)  
In Title 20 -A Chapter 105 §1601. Definitions . A community school district means “a school 
administrative unit consisting of the inhabitants of and the territory within 2 or more 
municipalities.” Although the inhabitants of the community are described as “administrative”, the community school district’s administrative authority is limited to voting for school board members, and on the school budget and referenda.  
The district school committee is the school board, which is an admini strative board, not a 
representative board. The Board of Trustees consists of one municipal member elected by the voters out of three municipal members appointed by the town selectmen. The inhabitants of the community can vote on whether the school board c an function as the board of trustees. The 
Community School District or the inhabitants of the community, can vote for the board of trustees but only from three candidates chosen by the selectmen.  
What are the exceptions to the general rules of the public s chool system that the new Boothbay 
School Charter allows? The powers of the Board of Trustees and the District School Committee are expanded in LD  1786   
Title 20 -A, chapter 105 §1654. Powers, du�es and authority E .  
May acquire, construct  and operate related recrea�onal and athle�c facili�es, which 
may also meet other community needs.  
LD 1786  Sec. 3. Board of trustees; district school commite e The board of trustees 
may act as a building and facilities governing committee, including authority in 
Tes�mony on LD 1786  
consultation with the district school committee over the budget for maintaining, 
repairing, replacing and improving the community school district's buildings and 
other facilities and over the district's capital reserve funds.  (emphasis added)  
Chapter 105: COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT 
Subchapter 3: FINANCING §1706. Reserve fund  
Community school districts may establish a reserve fund as follows:   [PL 1989, 
c. 132, §3 (NEW).]  
1.  Establishment.   A community school district may establish a reserve fu nd for 
school construc�on projects, ﬁnancing the acquisi�on or reconstruc�on of a speciﬁc or type of capital improvement, ﬁnancing the acquisi�on of a speciﬁc item or type of 
capital equipment or any of the expenditures listed under sec�on 1485, subsec�on 1, 
paragraph A  by including a request in the district budget, which must include a 
descrip�on of the purpose of the re serve fund, and receiving voter approval.   
LD 1876 Section Three co-ordinates with HP 1845-  An Act to Amend the Educational Statutes  
enacted in April of 2022. Both Acts propose that general rules do not apply to some parts of the 
public -educational system and yet the exceptions will be publicly funded obligation. HP 1845 
proposes that “demonstration- research schools” can “innovate” their own rules.  
In Boothbay there exists a development cabal (secretive organization) that funded the architects to design a new school system. The school administrative board said that the funders wanted to remain anonymous and so to learn their identities  I submitted an FOAA request. I first heard of 
the idea when Paul Coulombe, a dominant and high- profile local developer and owner of the 
country club and many other properties on the peninsula, suggested that a new school system would attract well- heeled f amilies to the peninsula, which has a declining school attendance 
according to Selectman, Charles Cunningham’s write up for his re -election campaign.  
 Mr. Cunningham told of the declining school attendees in the context of promoting extending the TIF zone  and appropriating TIF funding for a highly concentrated housing zone, which is only 
possible because of the enactment of H.P. 1489 An Act To Implement the Recommendations 
of the Commission To Increase Housing Opportunities in Maine by Studying Zoning and Land Use Restrictions, enacted as an emergency also in April of 2022, alongside H.P. 1845, An 
Act to Amend the Educational Statutes.  However, the well -heeled families that Mr. Coulombe 
wants to attr act to the peninsula would not live in such quarters. For one thing those families 
would own their homes including the land occupied by the home and the home would have a private yard. The housing plan will create an upstairs downstairs community such as t he 
peninsula has never known before, but Selectman Cunningham tells us that the corporate -owned 
housing zone with a density of 3.5 the surrounding area will allow families to live on the peninsula which will increase school attendance, clearly identifying that the two developments are of one coordinated plan. Coulombe says we need the school to attract well -heeled families 
and Cunningham says we need the concentrated housing zone to populate the school. However, Erin Cooperrider, the VP and spokesperson for  the Boothbay Regional Development Corporation 
has described what parses as a unit for four people as a 1200 square foot unit, which is half the 
Tes�mony on LD 1786  
size of what is considered a comfortable amount of space for four persons from numerous other 
sources. This mea ns there is no space for creativity within the concentrated affordable housing 
zone and to find such space the inhabitants might look toward a public facility such as a school.  
There is much public uproar about H.P 1489 for its infringements on the home rule authority provided by the Maine Constitution, but H.P. 1489 is not only arguably unconstitutional based on its own merits, but the concentrated housing zone, the subject of the new TIF zone and TIF financing is arguably unconstitutional pursuant to HP 1489 being enacted as an emergency. (See what Maine Constitution says about emergency acts)  
It is not my purpose to argue the constitutionality of HP 1489 but only to demonstrate that the proposed 100- million -dollar school and the corporate owned concentrat ed housing zone are 
linked together in a unified development plan advanced by a cabal so secret that when the Boothbay select board awarded the Boothbay Regional Development Corporation $50,000.00 dollars in American Rescue Plan funding it did not ask for the names of the board members, or other significantly missing information.  
The linking of the proposed 100- million -dollar school and the concentrated housing zone is 
disturbing in light of the fact that, in response to my FOAA request, it was confirmed that the administrative board elected from the start to fund the school with conditional gifts rather than tax deductible contribution, an option provided in Title 20- A, chapter 105.  
There is the open possibility that the conditional donor will demand units reserved for corporate employees in the concentrated housing zone. This is consistent with the narrative that Erin Cooperride r, the spokesperson and VP of the Boothbay Regional Development Corporation has 
been developing for years. In a 2018 Boothbay Register article titled Housing, water projects highlight Planning Commission annual meeting,  Ms. Cooperrider said “other communit ies 
have been targeting more specific industries or types of jobs, rather than income brackets.” Apply that to the “affordable workforce housing zone” and see what sort of political system you get. The targeted industries are state targeted industries acti ng in the capacity of a stand -alone 
corporation, even though industries outside of the state’s targeted sector have the capability of providing equal pay even at the disadvantage of being part of the public that subsidizes state targeted industries, Ms. Cooperrider is saying that anyone working in the free enterprise sector, which exists outside of the state’s targeted industry sector, can be given the very least consideration when applying for housing. 
Since there are no conditions placed on the “donor” of  the conditional gift, the donor can make 
nondisclosure a condition. The only statutory condition in conditional gifts is that the inhabitants 
of the district must honor the conditions made by the donor in perpetuity. As written, the community school distr ict is given no consideration while the donor can make anything a 
condition, but it is the property owned by the inhabitants of the district which serves as equity should the district default on its debt, pursuant to §5701. Debt liability (referenced in Ti tle 20, 
chapter 105)  
The personal property of the residents and the real estate within the boundaries of a municipality, village corporation or other quasi -municipal corporation may be taken to pay any debt due from 
Tes�mony on LD 1786  
the body corporate. The owner of propert y taken under this section may recover from the 
municipality or quasi -municipal corporation under Title 14, section 4953.   
It is my opinion that the conditional gifts option should be repealed in Title 20- A but since it is 
not, a local school charter that prohibits the use of conditional gifts as a funding method of 
Boothbay’s public educational system will do. This idea was likely not  even considered as those 
in charge of writing our new school charter are a special interest group pursuant to the 100-million -dollar proposed school system. Conditional gifts are just another name for a legalized 
pay to play system, which will have an inordinate effect on the character of our public educational system. I believe that the state educational statutes are designed to transform the public educational system into an instrument of the state’s economic development agenda, specifically in considera tion of Title 20- A: EDUCATION Chapter 313: CAREER AND AND 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION.  
 What we lose when the State conflates our publ ic educational system with state economic 
development agendas, is a holistic education that values the individual and gives the young mind background knowledge for choosing the career path that is right for the individual rather than indoctrinating the student into a career path serving the interests of the corporate state at the 
earliest age possible. A technical education should be an option but it should not be a publicly 
funded option as that creates an unfair advantage for the states targeted sector over the free enterprise sector, which is subsidizing the state’s targeted sector.  
 Erin Cooperrider is one of three unelected commissioners who wrote the frame work for H. P. 1489 which has caused so many to cry foul against state pursuant to the Maine Home  Rule 
Amendment, and attempted carveouts from its totalitarian rule over Maine municipal ordinances, which is a matter of local and municipal concern, for which the authority is granted to the local unit of government by the Home Rule Amendment.   State co rporatism and Home Rule are diametrically opposite political philosophies.  
Home Rule grants authority to the inhabitants of the Municipality. Title 20 Chapter 105 largely repeals the authority of the community school district and grants that authority inst ead to 
administrative boards.  
Last years, H.P. !845 links up succinctly with T itle 5: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

Subchapter 3: TECHNOLOGY CENTERS

6.  Rule -making authority.   The Department of Economic and Community Development may 
adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section. Rules adopted pursuant to this 
subsection are routine technical rules as defined in  chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A.   
The mockup for the new school looks  more like a corporate headquarters designed for adult use, 
with its very high balconies in a glamourous setting of high ceilings and floor to ceiling glass 
walls. Is this a setting for sometimes raucous teenagers, or a setting for another public -private 
state technology center, all of which are required to have a link to the public university system at 
the core of which is the University of Maine, which is not only an educational system but state manufacturing, which includes  the Advance Manufacturing Center of the University of Maine  
and last year’s new Maine Space Corporation:  
§13201. Maine Space Corpora�on established  
3.  Workforce.   Facilita�ng the crea�on of a highly skilled workforce and

regions and satellite programs, elementary and secondary schools and other organiza�ons in the State to ensure educa�on, training and recruitment programs are in place for  the primary purpose o f ensuring the availability of a 
highly ski lled workforce to support the State's new space economy; (emphasis 
added)  
An FOAA request revealed that the board had elected to use conditional funding rather than tax -
exempt funding available through the AOS 98 educational foundation. Conditional funding is 
indistinguishable from corporate welfare deals that the State has been negotiating for years, but the corporate welfare deals require tax exempt zones like the Pine Tree Zone or Opportunity Zones to transform a refundable tax credit into a subsidy. Today large corporations expect to be generously subsidized if they are to locate in any neighborhood. Transforming our public educational system into hidden corporate welfare systems allows the state to implement its corporate welfare deals in any neighborhood. Superintendent Kahler has spoken of negotiating with corporate donors as well as having identified that the negotiations are done as conditional gifts.  
Title 20 -A, chapter 105. COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT includes a provision for accepting 
conditional gifts. So does Chapter 223: MU NICIPAL FINANCES  §5654. Conditional gifts .

A matter of great significan ce is found in the  University Of Maine Claims Ownership of 
Intellectual Property Rights  
In 2004, The University of Maine System, Statement of Policy Governing Patents and 
Copyrights , claims the right of ownership by the University of intellectual property created by 
university staff and students and uncompensated individuals, based on the universit iy’s 
ownership of publicly- funded facilities.  
In 2011 The US Supreme Court held that a researcher inventing a patent in a federally funded lab 
owns the patent.  
Patent Ow nership  
The Intellectual Property Clause grants ownership of a patent to the inventor of the patent. In Stanford University v. Roche Molecula r Systems Inc, 563 U.S. 776 (2011) , the Supreme Court 
held that even when a researcher at a federally funded lab invents a patent, that researcher owns the patent.  
The University of Maine is a State University that has be en federally funded since birth, but as of 
today, it is still claiming rights to its ownership of intellectual property based on usage by the 
true author of the University’s publicly funded facilities.  
In 1999, §1921. Maine Patent Program  was enacted as an educational program on patenting. 
The University of Maine claims that it can charge “a reasonable percentage of the royalties for any successful innovation patented through the program for services provided in registering a patent.  
2.Applicant’s costs and du�es. An applicant accepted by the program shall pay the 
costs of the patent search and opinion and for patent prosecu�on if the ﬁnal product 
Tes�mony on LD 1786  
is manufactured or licensed out of state. An applicant shall pay to the program a 
reason able percentage of the royal�es for any successful innova�on patented 
through the program. [1999, c. 731, Pt. WWW, §1(NEW)  
4. Fund. The Maine Patent Fund, referred to in this chapter as the “fund,” is 
established as a revolving, nonlapsing fund to supple ment the Maine Patent 
Program. All money from royal�es received from applicants pursuant to this chapter must be credited to the fund. Money in the fund not currently needed to meet 
expenses of the program must be deposited with the Treasurer of State to the credit 
of the fund and may be invested as provided by law. Interest on these investments 
must be credited to the fund. Money in the fund may only be expended in accordance with alloca�ons approved by the Legislature.  
I have never heard of such a pract ice in the private sector. where royalties belong to authors and 
are not appropriately claimed as a fee for a service. The University is acting like an intellectual 
property vulture and its policies are extended into the public educational system of Maine, and most highly likely to be extended to tech centers and “makers” facilities, as is talked about for the 100m -million -dollar school. 
 Pursuant to Home Rule , a local school charter can protect the students from such practices found 
at the state level but the Boothbay District School Committe e has ditched out local charter and 
replaced it with State -controlled public education that sounds like it will be workforce industrial 
training and a corporate -controlled innovation center where the owners of the facil ities can 
freely roam looking for intellectual property whose ownership they can claim rights to over the true authors based on ownership of the facilities - a very Communist idea. 
 Since the state has been centrally managing our economy through public -private relationships, 
the wealth divide has continually expanded, which should not be surprising in a system whereby the whole economy subsidizes the top of the economy. Now, with a lot of help from unregulated short -term rentals the wealth divide has become the ownership class -working class divide. The 
Boothbay Regional development cabal’s solution is to build corporate -owned undersized 
overcrowded single -family homes for the working classes and a spacious oversized tech center 
school where the working classe s who no longer own homes may be challenged over ownership 
of their own intellectual property. This is a recipe for dystopia. If the100 -milliond -ollar facility 
becomes a reality, our school district committee has failed the school district by tossing away our local school charter and failing to protect the interests of the public. 
This charter is handing our local power over to the state, which seems to be the purpose in 
redoing our school charter at this time. Instead, our Local charter should retain local  power, 
reclaim authority for the inhabitants of the community and mandate teaching the Maine 
Constitution in public schools beginning in secondary school.
