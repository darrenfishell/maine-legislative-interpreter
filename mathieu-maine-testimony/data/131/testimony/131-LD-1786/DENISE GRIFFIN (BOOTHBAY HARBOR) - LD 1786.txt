Re: Support for Boothbay-Boothbay Harbor Community School District Charter LD 1786 
 
 
I am writing in support LD1786 which will approve the change requested to the Boothbay-Boothbay 
Harbor Community School District Charter.  I am a year-round resident of Boothbay Harbor, a property 
owner since 1980, and a  Selectboard member from 2014-2023. 
 
The original Charter has been in existence since 1953.  The agreement has been amended many times.  
The current Charter:   
 
- is an unwieldy document containing very outdated language and does not comply with current 
state statutes 
- does not meet today's modern school capital and financial needs 
- requires only 25 residents to vote on a $10 MM++ dollar budget (in an in-person school board 
meeting), a far cry from the 1954 community school district budget. 
 
The Selectboards from both towns met jointly, no less than 4 times, in publicly advertised workshops 
with the school superintendent, school board and school trustees to discuss the need to update the 
Charter.  Ultimately, the Selectmen from both Boothbay and Boothbay Harbor unanimously adopted the 
new Charter language drafted by the CSD attorney.   The School Trustees unanimously voted in favor of 
the new Charter.  The School Board also voted in favor of the new Charter with 1 person opposed.   
 
The new Charter meets the current state requirements and moves the school budget approval process 
to the ballot box which will result in greater involvement by local residents.   
 
The new Charter is the result of tremendous collaboration by four boards of elected officials from two 
towns.  This is a true example of a ‘win-win’.  I urge you to vote for LD1786 and approve this change to 
the Boothbay-Boothbay Harbor School District Charter.
