Re: Testimony of the Retail Lumber Dealers Association of Maine in Opposition to LD 
1385, An Act to Amend the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of1992 Regarding Employee 
Liability I
‘ 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Members of the Labor and Housing Committee:A 
My name is Dan Riley, an attorney with the ﬁrm of Norman, Hanson & DeTroy in Portland, and I serve as 
counsel to the Retail Lumber Dealers Association of Maine (RLDAM). The RLDAM represents independent 
lumber and building material dealers, manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and other associated businesses 
in the state of Maine who employ more than 20,000 Maine residents. The Retail Lumber Dealers are opposed to 
LD 1385. 
Our members agree all employees should be safe in the workplace. However, an employer should not be held 
responsible for the actions of another employee whose misconduct, on the job, causes injury to a fellow 
employee. 
An unintentional consequence of this bill could be increased WC costs for all businesses in Maine, not just 
those who have claims brought against them. This bill would drive up workers compensation insurance rates for 
all businesses, since instuance is a risk pooling tool to spread risk and cost across many. 
The reforms enacted in the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992 stabilized the workers’ compensation 
insurance market at a time when it was at risk of failure. Those reforms have served our members, and our 
employees, very well over the past 30 years. 
For these reasons, the RLDAM and its members are oppgsmedhtoiirtxliis legislation.
