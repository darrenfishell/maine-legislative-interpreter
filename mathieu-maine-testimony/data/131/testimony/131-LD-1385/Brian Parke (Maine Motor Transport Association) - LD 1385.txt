Workers‘ Compensation Act of 1992 ,,,,,_l,,m_,,,_
U Regarding Employee Liability ” £397)!“-#11! 
Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on 
Labor and Housing. My name is Brian Parke and I am the President and CEO of the Maine 
Motor Transport Association and a resident of Brunswick. The Association is comprised of 
more than 1,700 member companies, whose employees make up a large portion of the 
32,000 people who make their living in the trucking industry in Maine. 
l am also the Trust Administrator of our group self-insurance program, the MMTA Workers‘ 
Compensation Trust. l am here today to testify in opposition to LD 1385 for the same 
reasons we testified against LD 53 - eroding the foundational principles of the workers’ 
compensation exclusive remedy is a bad idea. 
While creating additional litigation as well as workplace and systemic friction might not be the 
intent of this bill, it is all but guaranteed to be the result. As we have stated before, this is 
completely contrary to the grand bargain of workers’ compensation insurance which is to 
avoid civil litigation on both sides — effectively relieving employees of the burden of proving 
fault and preventing employers from asserting the common law defense of contributory 
negligence. I can see why lawyers would want this, but it is bad for the system and it goes 
against the exclusive remedy’s promise of relative litigation certainty.! 
We respectfully ask that you oppose LD 1385. 
Thank you for your consideration and for allowing me to testify. l would be happy to answer 
any questions the committee has now or at the Work Session.
