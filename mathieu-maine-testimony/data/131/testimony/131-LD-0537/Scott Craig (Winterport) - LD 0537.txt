I am a Certified Fisheries Professional with the American Fisheries Society and 
greatly support this IFW Regulation change.  I have lived in Maine since 2003 and 
have witnessed the range expiation of non-native Bass throughout Washington 
County- especially Largemouth Bass.   Largemouth Bass have completely taken over 
the East Machias River- including mapped juvenile rearing habitat for Endangered 
Atlantic Salmon.  Largemouth are also now rapidly expanding their range in the 
Union, Machias and St. Croix Rivers.  We will never completely extirpate non native 
Bass from Washington County, but hopefully you will let me remove some to help 
our native Brook Trout and Salmon- as they need all the help we can give.  I hope not 
to see the day when our brook trout are on the endangered species list!
