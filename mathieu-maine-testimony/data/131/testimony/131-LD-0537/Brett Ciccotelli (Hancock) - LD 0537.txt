LD 537
Members of the Committee,
Thank you for considering LD 537. As a fisherman, guide, and outdoors person who lives and
works in Eastern Maine I'm also excited to see the legislature prioritizing science and working 
to protect our rivers and fisheries. I would like to offer support for this bill and hope that it 
sparks many more discussions around what else needs to be done to protect the rivers of 
Downeast Maine.
Thank you.
