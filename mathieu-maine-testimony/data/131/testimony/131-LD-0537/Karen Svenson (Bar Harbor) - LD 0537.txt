Public Hearing for LD537, 131$‘ Session 
Dear Committee Members, 
I encourage the lF&W Committee to recommend passage of LD537 which aims to signiﬁcantly 
reduce predatory, introduced bass in waters shared by endangered Atlantic salmon and native 
brook trout. 
By removing more of the larger fish that prey especially on young Atlantic salmon, thereby 
impeding successful recovery efforts, considerably more smolts (the seagoing young salmon) 
will survive —-giving them a chance to really launch recovery of this endangered species. This bill 
does not aim to eradicate bass in the waters named, but simply to reduce predation by them. lt 
is a timely and vital step towards bringing some balance back to the ecosystem from which we 
all benefit.l 
Sincerely,
F
