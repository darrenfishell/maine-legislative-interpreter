An Act to Remove the Limits on Bass Fishing in Washington County Rivers]
My name is Joseph Robbins from Winthrop Maine and I have businesses in Washington 
County.  I have fished for Atlantic Salmon in Maine’s  down east rivers since 1959.  I have 
seen the best that salmon fishing can offer.  The State of Maine lists Redfin Pickerel as 
endangered and the Swamp Darter as threatened.  The state does not consider the Atlantic 
Salmon to be threatened of endangered.  The federal government considers the Atlantic 
Salmon to be threatened.  The present numbers beg the question:  What is Maine doing to 
enhance and protect this fish.  The fish can’t talk.  If they could they would be screaming for 
help.  You can help.  One easy way to help is to limit the predation known to harm the salmon
population. Known predators like seal and cormorants are protected.  Freshwater bass are 
another predator.  Reducing predation from bass in the Downeast rivers will help the Atlantic 
Salmon parr and smolts and will enhance the numbers that escape to the ocean.   I thank you
all for your time and service.  
I have served on the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Advisory Council, Sportsman’s Alliance of 
Maine board of directors, founding member of the Downeast Salmon Federation and board 
member, member of the Atlantic Salmon Federation.  Most of the members of the Downeast 
Salmon Federation have never fished for Atlantic Salmon.  They work for the
