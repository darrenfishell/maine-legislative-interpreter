Re: Testimony in support of LD 1850, “An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State’s 
Energy Goals” 
Senator Lawrence, Representatrve Zregler, members of the Energy, Ut1l1t1es and Technology 
Comrn1ttee 
My name 1s Jeremy Payne and I am a prmcrpal w1th Cornerstone Govermnent Affa1rs Group 
here to testrfy 1n support of LD 1850 on behalf of our chent the Mame Renewable Energy 
Assoc1at1on (“MREA”) 
We want to thank the sponsor for cont1nu1ng to lead on the nnportant rssue of energy storage 
Storage offers tremendous promrse for the state, consumers, and our ab1l1ty to cost-effectrvely 
and expedltlously meet our clean energy goals We support the d1rect1ve to the Mame Publ1c 
Ut1l1t1es Cornm1ss1on (“PUC”) and the Governor ’s Energy Ofﬁce (“GEO”) to evaluate 
pro grammatlc desrgns for a storage procurement of up to 200 megawatts 
Storage has an rntegral role to play 1n Ma1ne’s clean energy future through helplng to avold 
costly 1nfrastructure upgrades, reducrng the amount of fossll fuels needed to serve peak load 
hours, maxrrmzmg the value of our clean energy supply, and reduclng costs through actrve 
management of our gnd 
LD 1850 env1s1ons a competltrve storage procurement whereby prrvate compames w1ll compete 
on prrce to secure long-tenn contracts We support th1s concept as a clear message to the 
marketplace to begm readymg therr p1'Q]6C'[S to b1d — one recommendatron we would make 1s to 
accelerate the trmelme as much as possrble As prrnted, the b11l appears to env1s1on a 
procurement occurrlng sometnne m 2025 Gwen the energy pr1c1ng challenges before us, and 
the role energy storage can play 1n helprng address cost concerns, movmg ahead w1tha 
procurement as qulckly as feasrble must be a pr1or1ty 
Energy storage can help consumers, who are fac1ng nsmg prrces because of explodmg natural 
gas costs, by chargrng up battenes W1th renewable energy when pnces are low — e g , solar 
durlng the day, wmd and hydro durmg the mght — and then dlschargmg those battenes when 
costs are hlgh to help smooth out pr1c1ng peaks — e g , 1n the evenrngs when people return home 
from work

Storage can also play a valuable role in stormg up clean electrons that may have otherwise been 
constrained by system limitations — 1 e , too much power trying to use the same infrastructure to 
serve load — and allowing those low-cost resources to be stockpiled and made available later on 
to cost effectively serve Maine load 
We do not support a new or expanded role for Maine’s investor-owned utilities to own or operate 
energy storage projects beyond what 1S already codiﬁed in existing law‘ The legislation may 
presuppose a role for utilities to play and we reject this as urmecessary — we are not aware of any 
particular service or role a utility can provide that offers umque advantages to the efﬁcient 
operation of the grid Some may argue that utilities need this tool to operate the grid — we agree 
that storage can be helpful in voltage regulation and active grid management Where we differ 1S 
we do not believe utilities need to build, own, and operate storage projects to provide those 
services The private marketplace 1S ready, willing and able to serve that role Right now, there 
is an active rate case at the PUC for Central Maine Power (“CMP”) which contains two energy 
storage projects — and the PUC will ultimately make the determination if the construction and 
operation of those projects is consistent with current Iaw and necessary for the efficient operation 
of the grid We believe sticking with this current approach is appropriate and reasonable This 
also sends an important signal to private investors who will submit ﬁrm bid prices that they Wlll 
not be forced to compete with utilities who may be able to seek cost recovery for overages 
We believe storage holds great promise for Maine consumers and strongly support a streamlined 
and accelerated program design and procurement timeline to allow private companies to bid for 
contracts to help deliver energy savings for the state 
We respectfully urge the committee to remove Section 6 of the sponsor’s amendment and vote 
ought to pass 
Thank you
