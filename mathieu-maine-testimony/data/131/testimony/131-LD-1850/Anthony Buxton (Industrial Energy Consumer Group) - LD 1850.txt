m Opposltlon to 
LD 1850, An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State's Energy Goals 
Before the Jolnt Standmg Commlttee on Energy, Ut1ht1es and Technology 
May 16, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representat1ve Zlegler and Members of the J 01nt Standmg 
Commlttee on Energy, Ut111t1es and Technology 
IECG strongly opposes LD 1850, and the proposed Sponsor's Amendment to An 
Act Relat1ng to Energy Storage and State's Energy Goals 
The Amendment would repeal a fundamental prmclple of electr1c restructunng, 
the removal of T&D ut1l1t1es from owmng or operatlng powerplants There 1s nelther 
need nor any offered Just1f1cat10n for th1s retreat 1nt0 the past 
Batterles are stored generatlon When batterles operate, they are no dlfferent 
than generatlon The market d1stort1ons of generat1on are no less hkely to occur w1th 
batterles The evldence th1s Leglslature 
consldered 1n 1997 showed overwhelmmgly that ut1l1ty ownershlp of generatlon 
1mpa1red the development of competluve generatlon markets Th1s mternatlonally 
observed phenomenon has not changed

However, slnce electrlc deregulatlon and ut1l1ty d1vest1ture of generatlon at the 
State and Federal levels 1n the 1990 -2000 penod, the cost of compet1t1ve generatlon 1n 
these markets has fallen prec1p1tous1y Solar 1s ava1lab1e for 3 - 5 cents/kWh, wmd for 
sl1ghtly more, compet1t1ve gas ﬁred generatlon has mcreased natlonally because 
natural gas leaves the ground at a pr1ce equal to a twenty cent per gallon cost of 
gasollne Coal and 011 are on the way out In fact, only where ut1l1t1es st1l1 control or 
own generat1on do coal and o1l stlll prosper as generat1on We also note that ownersh1p 
of battenes by ut1l1t1es 1s 1nherently more expens1ve than 1s pr1vate 0wnersh1p There 1s 
no beneﬁt from and real harm to ut1l1ty ownerslnp of generatlon 
There also 1s no need for ut1l1ty ratepayers to subs1d1ze batter1es Non-ut1l1ty 
markets are 1nvest1ng huge amounts 1n battenes - over $220 m1ll10n 1n 2021 alone 
Chma, Europe and Warren Buffett are lead1ng the lnvestment There 1s no need for 
ratepayer capltal 
Battenes are presently non-econom1c 1n nearly every gr1d connected usage Dr 
S1lkman’s analyses show no economlc value of batter1es to ratepayers unt1l at least 
203 5 Recent trends are d1scouragmg, as battery costs have r1sen The Nat1onal 
Renewable Energy Lab sa1d 1n 2021 that battenes w1l1 be less expenslve by 2030 Both 
suggest wattmg for gnd scale prlvate battery mvestment 
IECG urges that Ma1ne consumers not be asked to subs1d1ze batterles Mame has 
better ch01ces 
We would be pleased to answer any quest1ons
