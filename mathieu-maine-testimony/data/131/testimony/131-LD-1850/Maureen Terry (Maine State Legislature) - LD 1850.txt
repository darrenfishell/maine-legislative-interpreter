Testimony of Rep. Maureen T errv in support of 
LD 1850, An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State's Energy Goals 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and esteemed colleagues on the Joint Standing 
Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology, I am Maureen Terry, representing part of 
Gorham in House District 108 I am pleased to offer testimony in support of LD 1850, An Act 
Relating to Energy Storage and the State's Energy Goals.‘ 
In the 130th Legislature I introduced legislation, which has snice become law, to incentivize 
companies who own energy storage facilities to come and set up shop right here in Maine At 
that time, Maine only had a few, small energy storage facilities, but the need for this technology 
was growing Energy prices were nsing to an all-time high and nidividual consumers and all 
ratepayers pay more wider our current system, which is not well-equipped to manage peaks in 
demand As renewable energy production becomes a greater part of our overall energy supply 
chain — which we undoubtedly want and are working towards — we need to ensure that we can 
manage the consequences of spikes in supply which inevitably occurs with renewable energy 
We know that these peaks require the grid to generate and distribute large amounts of energy for 
short amounts of time,' resulting in a larger, less efﬁcient and more costly energy infrastructure 
This cost 1S distributed to all ratepayers, though consumers who pay demand charges are 
especially impacted 
Today, with even more growth in solar and wmd power across the state, it is imperative that 
Maine has the equipment and teclmology to support this growth and to get as much out of that 
clean energy as possible LD 1850 establishes a framework that will help us accomplish this 
LD 1850 has many components, as we have learned, including modifying our current energy 
storage capacity goals and providing ﬂexibility to the Govemor’s Energy Office in updating our

storage capaclty goals upward as we attract new development and reahze greater growth 1n the 
mdustry It also author1zes the GEO and the PUC to des1gn a program enablmg energy ut1l1ty 
compames to work w1th th1s energy storage mdustry to better facrhtate dlstnbutlon and 
transmrsslon of clean energy Tlns Wlll help keep rates stable for all customers because energy 
w1ll be stored and deployed when 1t’s needed 
In recent years, state pol1cy has afﬁrmed a commrtment to renewable sources of energy, buta 
complementary pol1cy encourag1ng energy storage capaclty has not yet mater1a11zed Th1s b1ll 
seeks to estabhsh that pol1cy framework, enabhng us to keep up w1th other New England states, 
and keeplng us on track to support and develop the mfrastructure needed to meet Ma1ne’s 
aggresslve renewable energy goals by 2030 and 1nto the future
