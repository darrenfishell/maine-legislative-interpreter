Maine Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology 
Written Testimony of Key Capture Energy in Support of LD 1850 — An Act Relating to Energy Storage 
and the State's Energy Goals 
May 16, 2023 
Dear Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler, and Members of the Committee 
My name is Paul Williamson, Senior Manager of Development — ISONE for Key Capture Energy Key 
Capture Energy ("KCE") supports the passage of LD 1850 to establish an energy storage target and 
investigate opportunities to procure energy storage systems This bill will take an important step 
towards putting Maine on track to meeting its clean energy and climate goals 
KCE is an Albany, New York-based battery energy storage developer, owner, and operator, focusing on 
development of utility-scale, stand-alone energy storage projects at both the distribution and 
transmission level 
Maine's passage of LD 528 in 2021 and its energy storage target of 300 MW by 2025 has set the state for 
rapid development of energy storage KCE has accelerated our development activity in the state, and we 
are committed to bringing storage to Maine Our CEO, Jeff Bishop, served on the 2019 Commission to 
Study the Economic, Environmental and Energy Benefits of Energy Storage to the Maine Electricity 
Industry, and we have been active stakeholder participants in the Maine Governor's Energy Office's 
Energy Storage Assessment 
Energy storage will provide a number of critical services as Maine pursues its clean energy and climate 
goals, most importantly shifting energy from times of high renewable energy production and low energy 
demand to periods of low energy renewable production and high energy demand 
LD 1850 would provide a pathway for the Maine Public Utilities Commission (the “Commission") to 
conduct competitive procurements and offer long-term contracts to bring large-scale energy storage 
systems online in Maine KCE has found that such contracts are the most cost-effective way to ensure 
that projects can be financed and built at scale Additionally, Section 6 of LD 1850 directs the 
Commission to establish the conditions under which utilities may own energy storage systems KCE 
recommends that this language not pre-judge that utility ownership is appropriate 
Utility-scale (also called "large-scale" or "front-of-the-meter") energy storage systems will play a major 
role if Maine is to capture the benefits of energy storage Nationally, utility-scale storage makes up the 
vast majority of new deployments, accounting for 84% of the total capacity of energy storage installed in
