Storage? 
I thought electricity, in its most efficient form, was generated at as close to demand as
can be estimated. Isn't that why ISO-NE was created?
Who would want to remake this system by adding costs with a mechanism that 
doesn't even produce electricity?
Doesn't Maine produce a nameplate capacity of wind and solar generated power right 
here in the state that surpasses the state's consumption?
Doesn't any excess of electricity produced in Maine not needed by Maine customers 
outlet into the rest of New England and even to Canada and New York. These other 
states and country are your battery.
Before you contemplate adding an energy sucking device into a grid invented on a 
supply-demand matching scenario, you should reveal to all Maine electric customers 
the kilowatt hour cost of Net Energy Billing, Power Purchase Agreements, RGGI, 
Efficiency Maine Trust, the Renewable Energy Credit Program and all administrative 
costs associated with renewable programs that the PUC, the GEO, the OPA and the 
utilities delivering power to Mainers have assimilated into their duties.
Include this information in everyone's monthly bill.
Have you no regard for electric customers? Over 60,000 of whom received 
disconnection notices from CMP for nonpayment of bills. 
This nonsense has to stop, 
This nonsense has to be reversed. Restore our grid to a competitive market.
If customers are so outraged about how electricity is produced, they will install solar 
arrays or wind turbines or non-carbon producing generators to provide their power 
needs.
The programs you have and are creating will make it less expensive for people to 
produce for their own needs, and that will be way too expensive for a lot of people.
Chasing Carbon Zero Is Futile. Carbon Dioxide is the Lifeblood of Civilization
