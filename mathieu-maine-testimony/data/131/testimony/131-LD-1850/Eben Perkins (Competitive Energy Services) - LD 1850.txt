Testlmony of Competltive Energy Servlces 
In Support of LD 1850, “An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State’s Energy Goals” 
Before the Commlttee on Energy, Utllltles and Technology 
16 May 2023 
Good aftemoon My name 1s Eben Perklns, and I am pleased to be here today speakmg on behalf of 
Competltlve Energy Servlces CES sees great pI‘0ITllS6 1n energy storage technology and supports the 
deployment of storage 1n Ma1ne when 1t can meet gnd rel1ab1l1ty needs 1n a cost-effect1ve manner 
L D 1850 proposes that the Pubhc Ut1l1t1es Comm1ss1on conducts one or more proceedmgs to 
determlne the cond1t1ons under whlch an lnvestor-owned transm1ss1on and d1str1but1on utlhty may own, 
have a ﬁnanclal lnterest 1n or otherwlse control an energy storage system CES has concerns wlth thls 
proposed approach for addresslng ut1l1ty ownershlp of energy storage We recommend the Commlttee 
carefully revlews Central Mame Power Company’s two recent attempts to develop ut1l1ty-owned 
battery storage 1n 1ts S6l‘VlCC terrltory, Wl‘llCl‘l had major ﬂaws and showed a ut1l1ty’s ab1l1ty to use 1ts 
monopoly power to unfalrly glve preferentlal treatment to utlhty-owned assets 
One of the key tenants of the Electrlc Restructurlng Act was to ensure that Ma1ne’s mvestor-owned 
ut1l1t1es cannot use thelr control of the grld to 1) unfalrly prevent others from accesslng and ut1l1z1ng 
the grld and 2) glve preferentlal treatment to ut1l1ty-owned generatlon assets Through the 
lnterconnectlon study process, a ut1l1ty’s study assumpt1ons and methodology have major lmphcatlons 
for the tlmellne and cost of new generatlon and energy storage resources to be able to mterconnect to 
the grld Thlrd-party owned energy storage projects can be easlly undermmed and potentlally kllled 
dunng the mterconnectlon process dependmg on how a project 1s studled by the ut1l1ty 
In CMP’s ongolng rate case, the Company proposed two ut1l1ty-owned, front-of-the-meter battery 
storage projects that would mterconnect to CMP’s d1str1but10n system Durlng questloning, CMP 
admltted that the Company planned to study the mterconnectlon of these two projects dlfferently than 
slmllar battery storage projects on 1ts system owned by th1rd partles Thls preferentlal treatment 1s l1ke 
Delta A1rl1nes bemg handed the keys to a1r traffic control at the Portland Jetport and glvlng Delta 
planes speclal access to the runway at the expense of other a1rl1nes 
The current statute and process for the Pubhc Ut1l1t1es Commlsslon to revlew ut1l1ty-owned energy 
storage proposals 1s worklng L1ke the two utlhty-owned battery projects proposed 1n the rate case, 
CMP’s proposal 1n 2021 to mstall and own a beh1nd-the-meter battery system at Casco Bay Llnes’ 
ferry termmal 1n Portland was scrutlmzed and recelved substantnal pushback from varlous stakeholders 
If the Leglslature belleves clarlﬁcatlon 1s needed on ut1l1ty OWI16I‘Sl1lp of energy storage, CES 
recommends a clear proh1b1t1on on Ma1ne’s lnvestor-owned ut1l1t1es ownmg and ﬁnancmg energy 
storage systems Mame 1s well on 1ts Way to meetmg 1ts energy storage deployment targets wlthout 
ut1l1ty-owned storage The energy storage market 1s st1ll nascent, openlng the door for ut1l1ty ownershlp 
through the proposed proceedmg w1ll send a chllllng slgnal to the market and would 1gnore clear, 
troublmg evldence from CMP’s two recent proposals for developmg ut1l1ty-owned storage
