Testimony of RENEW Northeast in Support of 
LD 1850 - An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State's Energy Goals 
Chairs Lawrence and Zeigler, and Members of the Joint Standmg Committee on Energy, Utilities and 
Technology, I am Francis Pullaro the Executive Director of RENEW Northeast, Inc (RENEW) 1 
RENEW 
submits this testimony in support of LD 1850 with its goal of deploying new energy storage resources in Maine 
Energy Storage Is Essential for Meeting Maine’s Climate Goals and Power System Reliability Needs 
LD 1850 will establish a robust energy storage requirement to match the magnitude needed to achieve 
the state’s decarbonization requirements by setting a goal of at least 300 megawatts of energy storage by 2025 
and of at least 400 megawatts by 2030 This requirement would foster development of new energy storage 
systems that can lower emissions according to goals set by Maine’s Climate Action Plan and reduce costs and 
pollution by displacmg from fossil-fueled generation umts running durmg peak hours 
Adding energy storage to the power grid at key locations can help reduce costs related to transmission 
congestion and curtailment of existing renewable energy resources Such congestion, if not addressed according 
to ISO New England (ISO) studies, will signiﬁcantly reduce the value of energy produced by the Northein 
Maine resources procured in the recently completed solicitation and by existing clean energy resources in 
Maine as well as lead to curtailed energy production from these resources This, in turn, could lessen the 
greenhouse gas reduction beneﬁts desired from this procurement, and potentially the economic viability of 
uncontracted renewable resources in Mame2 
Additionally, recent winter cold spells have shown that a large portion of the region’s winter peak 
energy needs are typically fulﬁlled by old generating units fueled by coal and oil 3 
By accelerating the switch 
‘ The comments expressed herem represent the views of RENEW and not necessarily those of any particular member of RENEW 
RENEW is a non-proﬁt association uniting environmental advocates and the renewable energy industry whose mission involves 
coordinating the ideas and resources of its members with the goal of increasing environmentally sustainable energy generation in 
the Northeast from the region’s abundant, indigenous renewable resources RENEW members own and/or are developing large- 
scale renewable energy p!‘0_]€ClS, energy storage resources, and high-voltage transmission facilities across the Northeast They are 
supported by members providing engineermg, procurement and construction services in the development of these pl'0_]6CiS and 
members that supply them with multi-megawatt class wind turbines RENEW seeks to promote policies that will increase energy 
diversity, promote economic development, and achieve policy goals including those found m the Renewable Portfolio Standard

from fossil fuels to energy storage at peak times, Maine can reduce emissions, nnprove the enviromnent, and 
attract new investment and jobs to the state at the same time Energy storage can complement renewable energy 
resources by absorbing their low-cost energy during times of surplus and store it for use during peak periods 
Storage can improve public health outcomes by replacing both baseload fossil fuel power plants and dirty 
peakmg power plants 4 Peakers are relatively mefﬁcient and used mfrequently during times of high electricity 
demand, and emissions ﬁom peakers directly harm local air quality 5 In addition, peakers are most often sited in 
disadvantaged communities and used on days when air quality 1S already poor 6 But energy storage resources, 
when charged with much cleaner energy sources, can provide the same grid services as a peaker plant without 
the associated emissions 
Competition in the Procurement of Energy Storage Will Provide Cost Savings for Consumers 
RENEW members are developing large-sized energy storage systems which are one of the least-cost 
forms of generation to meet electricity demand at peak times 7 Solicitations should force developers to 
compete, so consumers obtain the best solutions at the lowest price For this reason, RENEW opposes allowing 
electric distribution company (EDC) ownership of energy storage systems States like New York have 
determined energy storage resources are provided more cost-effectively by private developers on a competitive 
basis rather than by EDCs through guaranteed rate-of-return regulation Mame should follow suit and require 
that any EDC ownership demonstrate that altematives from competitive developers are, in the Words of the New 
York Public Service Commission, “clearly inadequate or more costly than a traditional utility infrastructure 
altemative ”8 New York concluded that “competitive ownership of energy storage assets is a core principle 
and the existing limitations on utility ownership of energy storage should be maintained if possible ”9A 
competitively developed project that is willing to cap the total cost exposure to consumers will ultimately be 
more beneﬁcial to customers than a project that retains the ability to seek recovery of all costs, including any 
overruns, without limitation 
Several Models Exist for Long-Term Contracting of Energy Storage Resources 
Long-term contracts for energy storage resources will provide those large-scale resources with 
opportunities in Maine to receive the long-term commitments that are needed for project ﬁnancing Section 3 of 
the bill directs the Governor ’s Energy Ofﬁce (GEO) to evaluate designs for a program to procure energy storage 
systems The GEO mvestigation should consider the form of contractmg best suited to speciﬁc energy storage 
teclmologies Storage deployment has advanced m recent years through the increase in utility procurement of 
energy storage projects and products The variety of offtake revenue contracts for energy storage projects has

expanded raprdly and typlcally 1nvolve an agreement as contemplated under LD 1850 For large or 
transmlssron-level resources, arrangements have taken the form of energy storage tollmg agreements, capac1ty 
sales agreements, hybnd agreements, and mdexed agreements 
0 The energy storage tollzng agreement, lrke a standard tolhng contract for a tradrtronal plant, glves the 
EDC capac1ty, energy and other products llke anclllary servrces The seller develops, owns, operates and 
mamta1ns the storage pro] ect wh1le the EDC off-taker typrcally controls when to charge and drscharge 
the resource, pays for chargmg energy ﬁ'om the grld to the resource, and acts as schedulmg coordmator 
or market partlclpant for the resource 1n the wholesale markets The p1'0_]CC'£ owner rece1ves a ﬁxed 
payment ﬁom the EDC Toll1ng agreements are used by many ut1l1t1es 1n vert1cally mtegrated markets 
that own generatron 
0 Under a capaczty sales agreement, the capacrty and capac1ty attnbutes of the energy storage pro] ect are 
sold to the EDC The owner-operator owns the fac1l1ty ’s other products l1ke energy and ancrllary 
servlces, and keeps full authonty over chargmg and d1scharg1ng Capacrty sales agreements area 
popular contract used by Calrforma ut1l1t1es to achleve resource adequacy requrrements 
0 A hybrzd agreement, WhlCh 1s also known as partral tollmg agreement, strlkes a mlddle ground between 
a full tol11ng agreement and a market pro] ect by grantmg the EDC operat1ona1 control durmg the mo st 
valuable days of the year for achlevmg pubhc pollcy goals, wh11e allowmg the pro] ect to operate ona 
merchant bas1s 1n the wholesale markets on all other days For example, 1t could prov1de the EDC’s the 
rlght to dlspatch the energy storage resource dunng a l1m1ted number of peak hours durmg a season or at 
other predetermlned per1ods to meet ob_]ect1ves under the Act It could prov1de a balance between 
beneﬁts and nsks for ratepayer, though 1t must be structured to prov1de enough revenue certamty to the 
pro] ect 1n order attract lower-cost caprtal Whrle the EDCs are sharmg the cost of the energy storage 
fac1l1ty, the thlrd-party owner assumes the market r1sks when the EDCs does not have dlspatch nghts 
0 Indexed energy storage agreements prov1de payments to energy storage systems to brrdge the gap 
between wholesale market revenues and the pro] ect’s revenue requlrement Under th1s type of contract, 
the counterparty, such as an EDC, makes a monthly payment to the resource equal to the b1d pnce mmus 
a reference pnce That reference prrce 1s based on an approxrmatlon of revenues that the energy storage 
system could have eamed 1n the wholesale markets 
Conclusion 
RENEW apprec1ates the opportumty to offer these comments 1n support of th1s b11l Usmg competn 1ve 
sol1c1tat1ons to add a slgmﬁcant amount of large-slzed energy storage systems to the gnd can prov1de slgmﬁcant 
cost, rellabrhty, and envlronmental beneﬁts to the people of Mame RENEW would be pleased to work w1tl1 the 
Comnnttee to contrnue to ﬁnd ways to lower the cost of renewable energy, decrease the reg1on’s dependence on 
foss1l ﬁrels and ensure a s1gn1ﬁcant role for renewable energy resources that w1ll boost Ma1ne’s economy
