•LD 1850 - An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State's Energy Goals
Neither For Nor Against
Dear Chairperson Lawrence and representative Zeigler and other distinguished 
members of EUT
My name is Clifford Krolick from Parsonsfield Maine.  I have a Bachelor of Science 
from Ohio State, a certificate in energy and environmental studies from Tufts 
University. 
To move Maine forward on climate, thru DER’s (distributed energy resources) 
Battery storage and regeneration facilities are critically important.  The scientific and 
historical nature of a battery is and always has been a generator of electricity.  
We already have one company that owns all the wires and transmission lines.  CMP 
has monopolized this feature of our utility.  
With the current large increases in electric rates many are experiencing the state 
should carefully weigh it’s options and permitting CMP to Monopolize the generation
of electricity through batteries that will most like receive energy through distributed 
energy resources from local small solar farms and individual suppliers may not be the 
best option. 
CMP has had a clearly defined business model as a transmission utility only.  It might
be a careless mistake to encourage CMP to add a battery energy generation model to 
their business.   
With current rate disputes, a long series of mishaps, and low customer service ratings,
this should give the state serious pause to not reward CMP to control all the battery 
storage and energy regeneration in our state. This would be a form of financial double
dipping.   If you think our electrical rates are high now they will be nothing compared
to what they could be if we encourage another monopoly ownership of battery energy 
generation and storage.
