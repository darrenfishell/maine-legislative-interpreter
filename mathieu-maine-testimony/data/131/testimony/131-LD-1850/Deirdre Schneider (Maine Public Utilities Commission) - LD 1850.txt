Testimony of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 
Neither For Nor Against 
LD 1850, An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State’s Energy Goals 
May 16, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Distinguished Members of the J omt Standing Committee 
on Energy, Utilities, and Technology (Committee), my name is Deirdre Schneider, testifying neither for 
nor against the sponsor’s amendment to LD 1850, An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State’s 
Energy Goals on behalf of the Public Utihties Commission (Commission) 
The sponsor’s amendment to LD 1850, which was distributed on May 15”‘ directs the Commission to 
conduct one or more proceedings to detemiine the conditions under which an mvestor-owned 
transmission and distribution (T&D) utility may own, have a ﬁnancial interest in or otherwise control 
an energy storage system m order to perform its obhgations as a T&D utility m an eﬁective, prudent 
and efﬁcient manner It provides the irmiimum considerations to be explored in a proceeding regarding 
the role a T&D utihty may have regarding energy storage systems It requires the Comrmssion to 
submit a report by February 15, 2024, to the Coimmttee that mcludes any statutory changes that may 
be needed to deﬁne this role for the utility The Comrmssion appreciates this approach, as opposed to 
the approach in the bill as drafted, because depending on the outcome of the proceeding, additional 
changes to Title 35-A may be needed before rules can be adopted 
In regard to Section 3 of the bill, the Commission notes the approach of requiring the Govemor’s 
Energy Ofﬁce (GEO) to design a procurement program for utility-scale energy storage systems and 
submit its recommendation to the Commission may be better suited to occur once the role of utility 
ownership of energy storage systems 1S more deﬁned Ifthere is a role for utility ownership, mterest or 
control m energy storage systems, that could impact the procurement process 
F mally, Section 4 of the bill requires the GEO to study long-duration energy storage and speciﬁes that 
the Commission shall provide technical, legal and other assistance to the GEO, as well as funding for 
staff and consultants not to exceed $300,000 from the Commission ’s Regulatory Fund This fund is 
funded through assessments on utilities, so it represents ratepayer funds It would be more appropriate 
for funding to support this work be provided through the Commission ’s Reimbursement Fund In 
addition, we note that m LD 952, the ma3ority of the Comrmttee voted to allow the GEO, absent other 
ﬁinding sources, to access up to $200,000 from this fund to study the feasibility of a Distribution 
System Operator While the Commission currently has sufficient fimds to cover both of these studies 
through the Reimbursement Fund, we are concerned that these two studies could absorb more than half 
of these funds, which are a source of mtervenor funding, funds used for DigSafe training and 
education, as well as fundmg used to educate the public on issues and resources for ﬁnancial 
assistance 
I would be happy to answer any questions or provide additional information for the work session
