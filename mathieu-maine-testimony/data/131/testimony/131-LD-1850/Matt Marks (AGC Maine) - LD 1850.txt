Testimony of Matt Marks in support of  LD 18 50 
“An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State’s Energy Goals ” 
Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology  
May 18, 20 23 
 
 
Senator Lawren ce, Representative Zeigler, and Distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology, my name  is Matt  Marks,  I am a Principal at 
Cornersto ne Government  Affairs  and here  toda y to testify  on behalf of my client  AGC  Maine.   
 
Energy  storage  procurement  will deliver  additional  value  to Maine ’s renewable  generation  
market  and support or sustain  construction  jobs.  Building  energy  storage  projects  include  
several crafts  from engineering , site preparation , concrete,  struc tural , electrical, and hoisting 
equipment with  crane s. In Texas ’ Rio Grande  Valley, a deve loper  recently  announced they  will 
provide  optimized  grid battery  storage , 200MW,  leveraging  the Fede ral Inflation  Reduction  Act.   
 
By adding  storage,  Maine  can optimize  generation  from  wind  and solar during  peak production  
and use the energy  as peak  demand  rises.  A Commission1 to Study  the Economic,  
Environment al, and Energy  Benefits  of Energy  Storage  to the Maine  Electricity  Industry  in 2019  
found  battery  storage  to have  the potential  to reduce  costs  and support renewable  energy.   
 
Maine ’s statute2 outlines  goals  for energy  storag e of 300 MW  of installed  capacity  within  the 
state  by the end of 2025;  and 400 MW  installed  by the end of 2030.  Legislation  signed by 
Governor Janet Mills set Maine on a path toward 100 percent clean energy and 80 percent 
emission reductions below 1990 levels by 2050 .  
 The ISO forecasts that both energy use and peak demand will increase in New England over the next 10 years , 2.4% annually over the 10 -year period, from the expected 138,081 gigawatt -
hours (GWh) in 2023 to 171,050 GWh in 2032. The prediction is based on the added electricity 
required for EVs and the migration to electric heat ing/cooling.  
 Energy storage procurement is essential for Maine to reach our energy goals and provides 
additional eng ineering and construction activity  in our state. AGC Maine urges the Committee 
to vote for LD 1850.  Thank you,  I am happy to answer any questions .
