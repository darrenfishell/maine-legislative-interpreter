RE Testimony regarding LD 1850, “An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State's 
Energy Goals” 
Dear Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and Committee Members, 
On behalf of Glenvale LLC, we want to thank you for your continued leadership on clean 
energy and climate change policy The Committee has been instrumental in advancing 
Maine on the path to grow our region’s clean energy economy, meet our climate 
commitments and deliver cost effective renewable energy for our most vulnerable 
communities 
Glenvale develops large solar energy projects Five projects in Maine have Power Purchase 
Agreements from the Tranche1 and 2 procurements These projects total approximately 
15ONlW which is equivalent to providing energy for about 37,000 homes The Projects are 
in Buxton, Baldwin, Hiram, Topsham, Warren and Turner They Wlll provide $60M of in- 
state and local benefits and about 200 construction jobs 
In addition to the renewable energy these projects will supply, we are planningdevelopment 
of large—scale battery energy storage at some of these sites 
LD 1850 is an important step to providing resiliency to Maine’s electric grid for the future 
The bill directs the Governor ’s Energy Office (“GEO”) and the Maine Public Utility 
Commission (“lVlPUC”) working together to put together the most effective procurement 
possible Glenvale IS in favor of LD1850, with the following comments 
1 We suggest that the bill advances procurement that selects projects that can be 
readily deployed in a cost—effective manner Projects that are well advanced in

development would be suited for the ﬁrst procurement and will help Maine achieve 
its climate goals, and learn from deployed projects The GEO and MPUC should 
prioritize procuring projects that are substantially advanced with regard to 
interconnection studies and permitting 
The proposed bill sets an energy storage policy goal of at least 300 MW of capacity 
located within the state by the end of 2025, and at least 400 MW of capacity by the 
end of 2030 Maine's abundant renewable energy resources are now limited by the 
existing transmission system, most acutely at the sub—stations in Orrington and 
Pownal, but also at the Maine—New Hampshire interface We recommend the 
Committee and the legislature think big with regard to this procurement, ora 
follow—up, so that the renewable energy potential of central and northern Maine can 
be harnessed We also recommend that consideration be given to each of the three 
key areas that have power—flow constraints with regard to existing generation and 
planned renewables (i e [a] south of the Surowiec substation in Pownal, [b] 
between Surowiec and Orrington, and [c] north ofOrrington) 
Glenvale believes the competitive market provides a great opportunity for Maine 
ratepayers to benefit from storage with the highest benefits, and lowest costs and 
risks We recommend that the bill seek competitive offers from independent 
developers, unaffiliated with the T&D service providers, who are better—positioned 
to bare risk 
The proposed bill requires that the GEO and MPUC evaluate designs for a program to 
“including but not limited to, through the use of an index storage credit 
mechanism ” The most important consideration for a program is that any income 
stream is predictable, and funded by a robust, credit—worthy payer Alternatives to 
index payments may be simpler, less expensive to rate—payers, and allow operators 
full discretion for charging and discharging, a key factor for an energy storage 
project Such programs could include monthly availability payments, performance~ 
based payments, or volumetric payments 
Transmission scale, privately owned generators have proven to offer ratepayers very 
cost—effective renewable energy, and we are confident that large—scale storage 
projects will also provide competitive pricing As such, Glenvale suggests the 
procurement have a target for large scale projects interconnected at transmission 
voltages, or at least allow projects ofall sizes to compete on a level playingfield The 
bill should also allow the procurement to slightly exceed the 300 MW in order to 
procure the sen/ices of any large project that straddles the MW target, without a 
reduction in project size which may impair thefinancability of the project
