VERSANT A POWER 
Testlmony in Support of LD 1850 
An Act Relating to Energy Storage and the State’s Energy Goals 
May 16, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representat1ve Zelgler, and members of the comm1ttee, my name 1s James Cote andI 
am here today on behalf of Versant Power 1n support of LD 1850, as proposed to be amended by Senator 
V1tell1 
Versant Power has come before th1s comm1ttee on a number of occaslons 1n recent years to descr1be how 
lmportant energy storage w1ll be to our state’s ab1l1ty to efﬁc1ently and cost-effectlvely trans1t1on toa 
gr1d powered by renewable energy wh1le ma1nta1n1ng customer affordab1l1ty and rel1ab1l1ty What was 
once a developmg teclmology, energy storage 1s now a cr1t1cal tool necessary for managrng voltage, 
prov1d1ng backup power for customers in the event of an outage, 1ncreas1ng the res1l1ence of our gr1d1n 
the face of worsen1ng storms, and enabl1ng the contmued 1ntegrat1on of add1t1onal amounts of renewable 
resources 
Versant Power agrees that addrtronal legrslatrve clanty and clear rules of the road regardlng the statutory 
and regulatory treatment of ut1l1ty operated and owned energy storage would be helpful It 1s 1n that 
sp1r1t that we support the proceed1ngs that LD 1850 proposes the PUC undertake to generate 
commonsense leg1slat1ve recommendatrons and appropr1ate guardrarls for the ownershrp and operat1on 
of energy storage p1‘O_]6CtS 
As demonstrated m other Junsdrctrons, energy storage pro] ects oﬁer “stackable beneﬁts” and can bnng 
long-term value for customers When desrgned and managed properly, some of these beneﬁts accrue to 
the grrd, e g 1n the form of voltage support or regulatlon, and others to developers or customers, e g 1n 
the forms of energy arb1trage The gr1d management beneﬁts of storage w1l1 be v1tal to Versa11tPower ’s 
gr1d modermzatron efforts and w1ll also allow us to max1m1ze the effectrveness of our exlstmg 
mfrastmcture 
To that end, Versant Power has been workmg w1th a range of stakeholders 1n vanous parts of our servlce 
terr1tory to explore energy storage and m1crogr1d p1'0_]6CtS that can provrde these types of beneﬁts whrle 
slmultaneously offer1ng 1ncreased res1l1ence and enhanced renewable energy rntegratlon In the Presque 
Isle area, Versant 1s work1ng wrth the M1’kmaq Nat1on on a pro] ect that would provlde outage protect1on 
to the local ﬁsh farm, cost—effect1vely enable the rntercomtectron of add1t1onal solar power and provrde 
enhanced res1l1ence for area customers 
In Eastport, we are work1ng alongslde the c1ty, the Island Inst1tute and ORPC, a renewable t1dal energy 
company to develop a storage and nucrognd project that would mcrease customer rel1ab1l1ty and 
res1l1ence followlng the farlure of an ex1st1ng dresel generator, fac1l1tate the 1ntegrat1on of ORPC’s 
1nnovat1ve t1dal technology and allow for further renewable energy to be mterconnected

VERSANT A POWER 
In both cases, Versant Power env1s1ons partnerrng w1th developers, commun1t1es or tnbes and sharlng 
ownersh1p and operatlon of these energy storage assets We beheve that multrple entrtres, each of whlch 
able to capture dlfferent beneﬁts from a storage dev1ce, make these p1‘O_]6CtS more economrcally vlable 
for all partres In both cases, Versant has also apphed for srgmﬁcant federal fundlng to help defray the 
costs to ratepayers 
We do note that trme 1s of the essence Wh1le we beheve that sendlng th1s analys1s to the PUC for therr 
evaluatlon 1s a reasonable step, we would encourage the comm1ttee to act w1th expedrency upon any 
recommendatrons next sess1on so that all stakeholders can put these solutrons to work as soon as 
poss1ble 
We look forward to worklng w1th the many relevant stakeholders- developers, customer advocates, 
trrbes, nonproﬁts, regulators and state pohcy leaders- who we beheve all have a role to play 1n Ma1ne’s 
energy storage future 
Thank you for your conslderatron, and we would be pleased to provlde more 1nformat1on at the work 
sess1on upon your request
