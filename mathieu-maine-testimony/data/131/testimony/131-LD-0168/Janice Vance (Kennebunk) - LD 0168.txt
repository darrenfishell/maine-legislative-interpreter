rs Fiream 
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee. My name is Janice Vance and l live in Kennebunk. I am a member of 
the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, which raises awareness about the effects of gun violence. I want 
to urge you to pass LD 168. 
We often hear about the right of “law-abiding citizens ” to own ﬁrearms. Law-abiding citizens 
have nothing to hide and are perfectly okay with having their status veriﬁed when purchasing. 
I’d like to talk about those who AREN’T law-abiding, those who could never pass a background 
check, but nonetheless are now able to purchase ﬁreanns. 
Such people purchase online, from ads in Uncle Henry’s, at gun shows, and through word of 
mouth. They use them to commit crimes. Or they sell them, at a proﬁt, to other people who 
intend to commit crimes. About 80% of ﬁrearms used in crimes are obtained from private sellers 
who don’t nun background checks. And because Maine doesn’t have universal background 
checks, ﬁrearms purchased here are used in other states that do have background checks. There’s 
a reason the Maine Turnpike is also called the “Iron Pipeline. ” So our lax laws negatively the 
safety of innocent people outside our borders. 
People who can’t pass a background check also buy ﬁrearms privately and use them to murder 
their ex-wives, bosses or other people they’re angry at. Or to kill themselves. 
Per Justice Clarence Thomas, the Second Amendment extends only to “law-abiding, responsible 
citizens. ” Universal background checks ensure that the vast majority of ﬁrearms purchasers ﬁt 
that proﬁle. The vast majority of Mainers support universal background checks, because they 
know that such laws make everyone safer. Please pass LD 168.
