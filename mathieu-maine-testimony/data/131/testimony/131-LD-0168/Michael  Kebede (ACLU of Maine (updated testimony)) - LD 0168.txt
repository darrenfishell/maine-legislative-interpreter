Neither For nor Against 
LD 168, An Act Regarding Crimin al Backgroun d Check s for the Sale, 
Transfe r or Exchan ge of Firear ms As Amended 
JOIN T STANDIN G COMMITTE E ON  
CRIMINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY 
April 4, 2023
     Senator Beebe-Center, Representativ e Salis bury, and distinguishe d membe rs of the 
Joint Standing Committe e on Crimina l Justic e & Publi c Safety, greetings. My nam e is Michael 
Kebede , and I a m the Policy Counse l at the ACL U of Maine , a statewi de organization committed 
to advancing and preservi ng civil rights and civil libertie s guaranteed by t he Main e and U.S. 
Constitutions.  
Yesterday, the ACLU of Maine submitted testimony against LD 168 and two other bills 
that used criminal penalties as enforcement mechanisms for gun control measures. In that 
testimony we stated that “If these bills were amended to remove criminal penalties as the 
enforcement mechanism, we would remove our opposition.” We understand that the bill sponsor, 
Speaker Talbot Ross, has amended LD 168 to remove criminal penalties as the enforcement 
mechanism. Accordingly, we withdraw our opposition to LD 168 as amended.  
We t hank Speake r Talbot Ross for maki ng this amendment, and urg e other legislat ors to 
similarly try to solv e socia l problem s without resort to crimina l penalties.
