LD 168: An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, Transfer 
or Exchange of Firearms 
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and members of the 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee 
My name is Ann Sawchuck and l live in Cumberland, Maine. l am a mother anda 
grandmother and my dearest wish is that Maine will be a safer state for 
my children and grandchildren. 
l support LD168 which requires all gun sellers to run criminal background 
checks before transferring guns to buyers at gun shows or through published 
and on-line advertising or marketing, with certain exceptions. 
Currently, federal law only requires background checks to be done for sales 
by federally licensed gun dealers. ln Maine, because background checks are 
not required for private sales, dangerous people who are legally prohibited from 
buying or possessing guns - including felons, fugitives and domestic abusers- 
can easily buy guns from unlicensed sellers. Many of these guns are then used 
in crimes, including homicides. 
We know that Maine has become a top “source state” for crime guns 
in Massachusetts with the Boston Marathon bombers using a trafficked semi- 
automatic weapon from Maine to kill a 27-year-old police officer. 
Even neighboring countries are not safe from Maine guns. ln 2020, the killer in 
the worst mass shooting ever in Canada (22 people were killed), obtained his 
guns in private sales at a gun show in Maine. These facts appall me. 
lt’s also been said that drug dealers from Massachusetts come to Maine to sell 
their drugs and pick up their guns. This reputation sickens me. 
Please support LD 168 and make Maine a safer state for our children 
and grandchildren and make us all proud Mainers.
