LD 168
Esteemed committee members, 
LD 168 is simply the same tired universal background check bill that Mainers have 
repeatedly rallied against and rejected, pushed through by the same people that push it
session after session. It is onerous, unnecessary, and will be both of those things every
single time it comes around. 
Maine does not have a major problem with private sales causing firearms to end up in 
the hands of criminals, and even if Maine did have that problem this bill wouldn't 
solve it. Criminals don't follow laws, and they won't be stopping in to their local FFL 
for a background check whether this passes or not.
LD 168 only serves to add the extra expense of transfer fees to the purchase of 
firearms by law-abiding Maine citizens, without any safety benefit for anybody. Best 
case scenario, it is meant to harass law-abiding firearms enthusiasts. Worst case 
scenario, it's a backdoor to a national gun registry through the 4473 form and the 
NICS system.
LD 168 ought not to pass!
Thank you, 
Richard Smith
