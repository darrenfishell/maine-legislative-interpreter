LD 168
I OPPOSE LD 168. STOP adding new firearm laws. NONE of which will STOP 
CRIMINALS. CRIMINALS don't care what laws are currently on the books, 
CRIMINALS won't care what NEW laws you enact. NEW LAWS only prohibit 
Law-abiding citizens. Why??? CRIMINALS ARE CRIMINALS. NONE of these 
STOP CRIMINALS. PERIOD. Until you change HOW criminals are prosecuted, 
HOW criminals OBTAIN FIREARMS, HOW criminals BY-PASS all existing laws, 
the ONLY thing you are doing is HURTING LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. PERIOD.
