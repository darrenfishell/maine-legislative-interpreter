Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, Members of the Joint Committee on Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety 
l am here today to speak strongly in favor of LD 168 — An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, Transfer or Exchange of Firearms. 
l have spent more than two decades seeking passage of measures that can help keep Mainers safe ~ on the streets and in their homes. ln that time, I have testified numerous times in favor of universal 
background checks for buyers of guns. 
I am well aware of the number of times this or similar in iteratives have failed in this Legislature - as well 
as once at the ballot box. ' 
This iteration, however, has been carefully crafted to avoid at least one of the ”hot button" issues of 
past campaigns — intra-family transfers. 0 
Given the amount ofgun violence in America today —- and the role guns easily purchased in Maine play 
in crimes in other states. I believe it is time we as Legislators find the courage to act on this clear step 
forward. Polls tell us background checks are now supported by the majority of Mainers, including gun 
owners. 
It is time to act. Please vote to pass LD 168.
