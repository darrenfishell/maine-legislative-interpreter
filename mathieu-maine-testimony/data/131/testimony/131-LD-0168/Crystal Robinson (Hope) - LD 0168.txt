LD 168
Dear Honorable Members of the Committee,
I urge you to oppose LD 168 - An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for 
the Sale, Transfer or Exchange of Firearms
LD 168 requires background checks for all private sales of firearms, including those 
at gun shows or resulting from advertising, with very limited exceptions. It applies to 
a private sale between two parties – including friends, neighbors, and coworkers, 
regardless of where the sale takes place. All such transfers – even if the seller knows 
the recipient is not a prohibited person – would have to be conducted through a 
federal firearm licensed dealer (FFL), with extensive federal paperwork, payment of 
an undetermined fee, and approval from the U.S. government.
