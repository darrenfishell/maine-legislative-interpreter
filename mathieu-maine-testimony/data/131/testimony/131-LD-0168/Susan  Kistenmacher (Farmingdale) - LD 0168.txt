LD 168
We all agree that no one wants a school or a grocery store mass shooting in Maine.  
No one wants kids and parents afraid to go to school.  And though Maine hasn’t had a
mass shooting,  we all would agree that we need to keep guns out of the hand of 
people who would use them unsafely.
There are several bills under consideration that would make a small step toward 
making Maine a safer place.
LD 168 An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, Transfer or 
Exchange of Firearms
This bill requires criminal background checks of buyers of firearms for private sales, 
transfers or exchanges at gun shows or private sales, transfers or exchanges resulting 
from advertising or marketing subject to certain exceptions. Under federal law guns 
bought at licensed dealers must go through a background check but guns bought 
through personal sales don’t require such checks.
LD 168 would close this loop-hole.
Background checks are supported by Mainers (Republicans and Democrats, southern 
and northern people) with 82% of registered voters.
Background checks work.  States that go beyond federal law and require background 
checks for unliscensed sales are associated with 10% lower homicide rates.  
Background checks keep people who shouldn’t have guns from getting them while 
only creating a small inconvenience for gun buyers and isn’t a small inconvenience 
worth it to save a life.
Please support LD 168.
