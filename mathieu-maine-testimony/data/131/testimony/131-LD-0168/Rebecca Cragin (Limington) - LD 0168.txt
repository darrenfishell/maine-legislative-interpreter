Rebecca Cragin
Limington
LD 168
Good Afternoon members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Rebecca Cragin from Limington. I am in opposition of LD168.
This bill was addressed already. It was Question 3 and was completely defeated by 
popular vote by Maine citizens in 2016. Our own Governor made a statement that 
“The people of Maine have spoken”. The bill’s sponsors are so tone deaf they refuse 
to listen to the people of Maine and it’s Governor.
Background checks for purchases have increased every single year since, giving 
support to the fact Maine citizens like their firearms. 
I’m disgusted to see members of the Legislature trying to display underhanded tricks 
of going around the will of the people and attempting to pass legislation under much 
more confined environments friendly to your cause. I and many others see this action 
for what it is and the most accurate way to describe it would be undermining our 
rights for their own political agenda. As if to say that our rights don't matter. But, they
do! 
As far as the criminals, by definition criminals don’t follow laws anyway. They will 
find any means of acquiring firearms to do their dirty deeds. 
So, to think that this law will do anything to stop firearms related crimes is foolish 
and naïve. It can’t be proven that it would even prevent 1 death.
Maine ranks as the safest state in the nation, with  firearms related deaths typically 
well under 20 per year. 
With all the deceptive practices and lack of listening on the part of the bill’s sponsors,
I urge you to vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
