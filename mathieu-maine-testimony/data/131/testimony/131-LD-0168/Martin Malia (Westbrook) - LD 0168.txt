LD 168
  I am writing to express my opposition to LD 168. An act regarding criminal 
background checks for the sale, transfer or exchange of firearms.  The right to keep 
and bear arms for self defense is a natural right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights in the
U.S. Constitution and the Maine State Constitution. LD 168 would require individuals
to utilize a federally licensed firearm dealer to facilitate a transfer for a private firearm
sale. Most federally licensed firearm dealers naturally charge a fee for their time to 
complete the background check on private sales. The fee is usually between $20 to 
$50  but it could be higher. The text of LD 168 allows for “a reasonable fee” to be 
charged but it does not define what is reasonable. Since LD 168 deals with access to a
civil right, can any fee be considered reasonable? Is there any other civil right that 
requires an individual to first pay a fee before they can exercise their right? Can an be 
individual be charged a $20 to $50 fee before they are allowed to vote?  These fees 
are a financial barrier that would disproportionately impact low income individuals 
trying to exercise their civil rights. 
     As the Supreme Court of the United States recently noted in it’s majority decision 
in the case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association vs Bruen  “The 
constitutional right to bear arms in public for self defense is not a second-class right, 
subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.” 
Ld 168 would treat the right to keep and bear arms differently than other civil rights 
such as voting by imposing fees on access and ought not to pass.
