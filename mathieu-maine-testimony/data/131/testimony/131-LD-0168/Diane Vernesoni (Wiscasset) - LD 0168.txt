LD 168
Dear Senator Beebe, Rep Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety committee,
My name is Diane Vernesoni, and I live in Topsham.
I would like you not to pass LD 168, An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks
for the Sale, Transfer, or Exchange of Firearms,
Guns don’t kill people, people kill people.  There is already a check when you buy a 
gun to make sure you aren’t on any federal or state watchlist.  I don’t believe the 
criminals who are the ones committing the deaths we hear about are worried about 
background checks.  As far as transfer or exchange, this could be between family 
members or an inheritance, etc.  This would make the practice of buying your child a 
gun for hunting very difficult. This is a Constitutional as well as a humane right.  
Being armed puts us less at risk.  In fact, armed citizens have actually saved many, 
many unarmed people from being killed by a would-be assailant.  The Declaration of 
Independence states our rights of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  
Sometimes this can only be accomplished by being armed.  The Second Amendment 
of the Bill of Rights in our Constitution gives us the right to “bear arms.”  It shall not 
be infringed upon. Therefore, the state of Maine my not take away our right to “bear 
arms” as given to us under the US Constitution!  
Thank you for your consideration.
