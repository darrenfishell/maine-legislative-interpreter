LD 168 To Senator Beebe - Center, Representative Salisbury and members of 
the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee: 
My name is Barbara Arsenault and l live in Mexico, Maine. l appreciate the 
opportunity to testify for the passage of LD 168. 
l have read this bill with the eyes of someone from northern Maine, who lives ina 
gun owning household, whose husband used to belong to the NRA and who 
believes in the second amendmentfl believe that LD 168 has the right balance of 
safety measures with purchases of firearms and the common sense exceptions. 
For example, it does not eliminate gun shows but requires that a federally 
licensed firearm dealer performs a background check at the shows. Already, 
federally licensed firearm dealers are commonly at gun shows. Please note that 
this bill does not require background checks from sales or transfers between 
family members. This is an important point as there was a lot of misinformation 
previously on question 3 from the 2016 referendum. For example we have the 22 
that belonged to my stepfather but when my stepfather had the diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's my mother wanted it out of the house. lt is now safely secured at our 
home. 
l am also for this bill as it would hopefully address the gun violence issues that 
we have in Maine. ln 2022 9 out of the 14 homicides occurred in the 2nd 
congressional district, according to Bangor Daily News which details the 
homicides in Maine January 1st each year. Two of the 9 were in the 
Rumford/Mexico area. This bill respects the rights of gun owners while closing a 
dangerous gap in our background check system. Maine has a long history of 
responsible gun ownership and the gun owners know that with their right to own. 
a firearm comes a great responsibility to ensure that it remains in safe hands. 
Thank you for your time today. l encourage you vote for LD 168
