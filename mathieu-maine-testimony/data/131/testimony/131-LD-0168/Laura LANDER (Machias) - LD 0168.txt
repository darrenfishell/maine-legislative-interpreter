LD 168
To our Maine legislators,
Requiring background checks on all gun sales is proven to reduce gun violence. 
Maine has a responsibility
to stop the “iron pipeline” and stop prohibited persons from having a gun and then 
transporting the gun to another state. Please save lives by supporting LD 168.
