LD 168
I strongly oppose LD 168, as it is YET AGAIN another bill that is determined to turn 
average, law abiding citizens into criminals simply for loaning or transfering property.
If my neighbor needs to borrow my rifle, I shouldn't need to find and pay an agent to 
transfer my property to him so he can protect his livestock. This law has 
REPEATEDLY been rejected by Maine's citizens, and I AGAIN reject it. Maine is 
one of the safest states in the union, and this law WILL NOT STOP CRIMINALS. It 
however WILL turn common citizens into criminals by doing what sportsmen an free 
citizens have always done.
