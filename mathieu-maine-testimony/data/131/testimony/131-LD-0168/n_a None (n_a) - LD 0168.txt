LD 168: An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, Transfer or 
Exchange of Firearms 
1. About 80% of guns used in a crime are obtained from private sellers. 
2. The gun used in Canada's worst mass shooting, 22 people, was purchased 
in Maine. We need to prevent Maine from being a source state. 
3. Death by Suicides will be reduced by this bill. 
4. Deaths using a Gun year to date, 9,642. 
5. Death by Suicide using a gun, 5,544. 
Why am l here. I was born in Waterville, raised in S. China, went to MMA and 
then was an officer in the Navy during Operation Desert Storm on an Aircraft 
Carrier. l've worked in Outside Technical Sales for 30 years in New England and 
the Midwest. 
Our son, Ryan at 16 years of age was able to steal a gun and ammo from the store 
he worked at and died by suicide that night, Sat. Dec. 5"â€˜ , 2020at 9:35PM. 
In the resent school shooting in Nashville, I know one of the teachers that works 
there. Thankfully, she was not harmed physically. 
Things need to change in Maine and the country to protect our people from 
themselves and others. l am a gun owner and hunter. I'm for common sense gun 
laws that will make it harder to commit crimes with a gun or die by suicide witha 
gun. 
Thank-you!
