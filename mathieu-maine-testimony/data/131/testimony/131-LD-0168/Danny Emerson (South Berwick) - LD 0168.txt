LD 168
I oppose LD 168, “An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, 
Transfer or Exchange of Firearms”.
This bill requires background checks for all private firearm sales, including those at 
gun shows or resulting from advertising, with very limited exceptions. It applies to a 
private sale between two parties – including friends, neighbors, and coworkers, 
regardless of where the sale takes place. All such transfers – even if the seller knows 
the recipient is not a prohibited person – would have to be conducted through a 
federal firearm licensed dealer (FFL), with extensive federal paperwork, payment of 
an undetermined fee, and approval from the U.S. government.
This bill is once again an attack on law-abiding Maine citizens, and a direct violation 
of our Maine Constitutional rights, specifically Article 1, Section 16:  “To keep and 
bear arms. Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be
questioned.”
My rights don’t end where your fear begins.
This is a solution looking for a problem that Maine does not have.  Maine is the safest
state in the nation. 
I oppose any bill intending to strip Maine citizens of our Constitutional rights.
Again, I oppose LD 168 “An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the 
Sale, Transfer or Exchange of Firearms”, and it "ought not to pass".
