LD 168
Dear Committee Members,
I strongly oppose this Act being proposed and ask you not to go forward with LD 168.
Private sales by private citizens has been conducted for many years and it is up to the 
seller to use due diligence when dealing with the potential buyer. 
I ask you to oppose this Act and stick to the Maine Constitution in regard to the 
Maine 2nd Amendment.
Sincerely, 
Simon Cavilla
