Re: LD 168 - An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, Transfer 
or Exchange of Firearms
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Kim Moulton. I am a resident of Fairfield, Maine. I am writing in 
opposition of LD 168 - An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, 
Transfer or Exchange of Firearms.
Private citizens do not have access to perform a background check, therefore they 
would have to pay a licensed firearms dealer to perform the check on their behalf. 
This proposed law says they may charge a "reasonable fee" but there is no guidance 
given on what is "reasonable". A "reasonable" fee by some state agencies for FOIA 
requests for example, have been documented to be many thousands of dollars. What is
the state's definition of a maximum "reasonable fee" for a private company to enter a 
firearm into their inventory, safely secure, insure, and hold it until a background 
check is complete? 
The exemptions for "family members" in this bill are arbitrary. While a stepchild and 
stepparent would be exempt, as would a domestic partner, the child of a domestic 
partner is not exempt because they share no familiar blood. Under this proposal, one 
could lawfully sell or give a firearm without a background check to a person they 
have only known for minutes - by virtue of a recent marriage to their parent, but they 
could not lawfully transfer ownership of a firearm to a close, trusted friend or family 
member (of third-degree or higher consanguinity) that they have known for over 50 
years. 
Maine voters have spoken on this issue. In 2016, Maine voters rejected expanding 
background checks on private sale and transfers and that vote should be respected by 
the law makers in Augusta.
I urge the committee to vote Ought Not to Pass.   
Respectfully,
Kim Moulton
