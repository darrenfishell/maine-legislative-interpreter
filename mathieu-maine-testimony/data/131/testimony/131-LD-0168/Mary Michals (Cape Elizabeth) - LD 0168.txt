LD 168
The horrific back story on Canada's deadliest mass shooting in the Portland Press 
Herald of  March 31, 2023, showed that background checks are necessary on all gun 
sales and transfers.  It is a stain on Maine that 3 of the guns used in that mass 
casualty.event came from here.  LD168 is an obviously necessary addition to laws to 
protect the safety of all people.  Shocking as well that the Boston Marathon bombers 
had a gun from Maine and killed an officer.  
We need to be responsible citizens and protect ourselves and others from those who 
do not value life.
