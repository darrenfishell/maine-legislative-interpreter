LD 168
Dear Committee Members,
I am David Lemoine, from Swan's Island.
I ask that you oppose LD168-An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the 
Sale, Transfer or Exchange of Firearms.  Maine already voted against this.  I will give
three more reasons to oppose it.  
1. Travel to and from a Federal Firearms License holder for buyer and seller is a 
costly thing in time and money, and subject to their business hours.  
2. "Reasonable Fee" for the transfer.  What the license holder considers reasonable 
may not be reasonable to the other parties. I have seen places charge over $50.00 per 
item, and I don't consider that reasonable, especially if the transfer is a couple guns 
with a combined value of $200, and the transfer  is $50 each. 
3. Under limitations the "advertisement, posting, display or other listing on the 
Internet or in 
a publication" causes concern.  That could be interpreted to include someone sending 
a message to friends, or any advertised yard sale that included a gun. 
We know this is an attempt to stop gun shows and sales through classified ads, but I 
have not seen private sales at gun shows in many years, and making it illegal to 
advertise selling something that is legal to own seems wrong. I have only sold guns 
through advertising when financial times were hard and I needed the money.  Adding 
transfer fees and travel expenses would have made those times worse.  
 
Thank you for your time.
