Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
April 3, 2023 
  
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Committee on Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety, 
 
My name is Grace Leavitt. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am serving as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51. I have over 43 years of 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certified teacher.  The MEA 
represents nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well 
as in our institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine 
Community College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as well as many retired 
educators. 
 
I am here to testify on behalf of MEA in support of LD 22 An Act to Impede the Transfer of Firearms to 
Prohibited Persons, LD 60 An Act to Require a 72-Hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a Firearm, LD 
168 An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, Transfer or Exchange of Firearms, 
and LD 582, An Act to Enhance Certain Penalties for Possession of Firearms by Prohibited Persons. 
 
Shortly after yet another horrific school shooting, the tragedy in Uvalde, the MEA Board of Directors 
took a formal position that said in part: 
 
“The MEA Board of Directors knows that it is essential that our students and educators have safe and 
supportive environments in which to learn, teach, and work. Therefore, the MEA Board of Directors 
believes it is critical for our government officials to take further actions towards preventing acts of 
violence, both in our places of education as well as in our communities.” 
 
Since then, we have continued to hear of mass shootings, both in schools and in communities across the 
nation.  
 
The following is from an article in the Washington Post, dated March 29, 2023, with the headline “More 
than 348,000 students have experienced gun violence at school since Columbine”: 
“There were more school shootings in 2022 — 46 — than in any year since at least 1999. 
“Beyond the dead and wounded, children who witness the violence or cower behind locked doors 
to hide from it can be profoundly traumatized. 
“The federal government does not track school shootings, so The Washington Post has spent 
years tracking how many children in the United States have been exposed to gun violence during 
school hours since the Columbine High massacre in 1999. 
“The Post pieces together its numbers from news articles, open-source databases, law 
enforcement reports, and calls to schools and police departments. 
“There have been 376 school shootings since Columbine 
“The most recent school shooting was 6 days ago.” 
 
In an article from November 2021 updated a week ago, it states that our country is the only one where 
there are more civilian guns than there are people—120 guns per 100 people.1 
 
Just last month, here in Maine, a ten-year old student brought a firearm to their elementary school.2 
Fortunately, the unthinkable was avoided—this time. 
 
We know that the measures called for in these proposals will not eliminate the possibility of yet another 
tragedy. They will not do much to alleviate the extreme worry, fear, trauma, or stress that every educator 
experiences when there is yet another incident, that every student experiences, that every parent 
experiences when we hear of these tragic, horrific events. But the measures called for in this proposed 
legislation may, just may, reduce that possibility, if only a bit.  
 
Even if we can move just slightly more in the direction of making our schools and our communities safer 
places for us all, shouldn’t we do that?  
 
I have been told that it is not a question of ‘if’ there will be a tragedy in Maine, but rather it is a question 
of 'when’. Yet I remain hopeful that we can change things so that ‘when’ never occurs. 
 
We urge you to vote ‘ought to pass’ on LD 22, LD 60, LD 168, and LD 582. It is the responsible thing to 
do.
