4/3/23 TESTIMONY FOR LD 168 — CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of the 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. i am still Carol Selsberg, an 85- 
year-old grandmother from Eliot, Maine, hoping you will vote LD 168 Ought‘ to Pass 
Who’s afraid of a background check to buy a dangerous weapon? You were 
OK with it when you got your driver’s license, hunting license, applied fora 
job, got a passport, rented a place to live. 
Last year, 90% of Americans favored background checks (Snopes) with FBIs 
checks accurate 99.3 to 99.8% of the time (Sandy Hook Promise Research). in 
the 100 years of background checks, it’s always been deemed constitutional 
(Everytown Law) 
Maine has become a gun source state with gun trafficking closely tied to drugs. 
From 2017 to 2022, 4500 crime guns came from Maine, including the Boston 
Marathon Bombers’ (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms). 
Here’s my-pardon the expression-bullet list of immediate reasons to regulate 
weapons with Notes to Self when considering ANY AND ALL safer gun laws: 
v 4,339 deaths, 7,725 injuries, 130 mass shootings, 61 children killed, 131 
children injured, 355 teenagers killed, 846 teens injured. IN THE FIRST3 
MONTHS OF 2023! (Gun Violence Archive) 
o 15,371 currently own guns in Maine (World Population Review). 336 mill 
own 393 mill. guns (5/22 Business insider and the Nat’l Shooting Sports 
' 
Foundation).-
, 
~ 20 million military weapons. For what? For who? Hunting? Kinda takes 
the “sport” out of it. National Crime Victimization Survey polls crime victims 
twice a year: 484,800 gun crimes vs. 70,040 defensive gun users with NO 
evidence they are using their 20 million assault rifles to defend themselves. 
Guns are used much more to intimidate others rather than in self-defense 
(The Harvard Injury Control Center). , 
We all have children, grandkids, nieces, nephews. What drills did WE have in 
school? What were OUR daily fears as kids? Trouble with multiplying 9's? 
Not ready for the pop quiz? No Prom date? Or being shot into small pieces 
by a military weapon designed to tear as many people, or kids, apart in as1 
short a time as possible? 
And l have to ask you to ask yourselves and colleagues if you are not 
appalled by ANY American leaders representing 331 mill. Americans while 
wearing AR-15 pins instead of American flags 
Thank you for saving lives with positive action rather than thoughts and 
prayers, and sensibly voting that LD 168 Ought to Pass
