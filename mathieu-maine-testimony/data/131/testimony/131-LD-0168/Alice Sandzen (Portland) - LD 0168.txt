LD 168
My name is Alice Sandzen and I am a mom to two lively and energetic children, a 3 
year old daughter and 1 year old son. My children are my world and my greatest fear 
is that I might lose them one day to gun violence. I shouldn't be afraid to send my 
children to school, but I am. While I appreciate and value that we live in a relatively 
safe state, our children are not safe, even here in Maine. We can and must make 
Maine a safer state for ALL children by requiring criminal background checks for the 
sale, transfer or exchange of firearms. When you consider this bill, consider who it 
will protect. It will protect Sylven who is just learning how to walk. The glee on his 
face when he takes steps would make anyone smile. It will also protect Foster. She is 
fearless and loves to ride her scooter up and down the street in front of our house.
