LD 168
Please forgive my grammar and punctuation if it is lacking. I did my best.
Thank you!
Felons who wish to do harm will transfer firearms between each other regardless of if 
LD 168 becomes law. Hindering the transfer of firearms between people who are 
trusted friends, coworkers or other people who are not prohibited persons will not 
stop felons from getting firearms illegally. Maine is a very safe state with - as far as I 
know - the least violent crime in the nation. What proof is there that the subject matter
of LD 168 is such a rampant problem in Maine that it needs government attention and
interference? I would bet 99.9% people who transfer firearms privately between each 
other do so in accordance with existing state and federal law. Why add more hurdles 
and inconvenience for a constitutionally protected right when it is not even a problem 
99.9% of the time in this state? One reason: To control with the pretense of public 
safety.
LD 168 isn't even enforceable to people who wish to break it. How is the government 
going to know Felon "A" gave a firearm to Felon "B" if it isn't in public with someone
watching that understands what is going on? It is nonsensical in my opinion because 
even if they are caught, Felon "A" already had the firearm and broke the law; a law 
that was already in place. Felons who wish to break the law are going to do it 
regardless of if there is a law telling them not to. Ninety-nine percent  of the people 
who are going to be affected by this are regular joe firearms enthusiasts, hunters, and 
second amendment enjoyers.  I am not even going to get on my soap box about how 
there is already enough hurdles for firearm owners already that violate the second 
amendment. If something is not really a problem, why add yet another law to the 
books? 
 This is why I believe LD 168 should not become law.
