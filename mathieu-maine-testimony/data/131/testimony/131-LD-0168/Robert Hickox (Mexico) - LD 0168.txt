LD 168
LD168 Universal Background Checks:
This looks good on its face, but the only way to enforce universal background checks 
is to implement a gun registry. Gun registries are unconstitutional and I do not support
LD168. Our guns are none of your business. My rights do not stop because people are
scared. Our second amendment rights are here to protect the scared people in the 
event a scarier situation were to ever happen. I would, however, support criminalizing
criminals and stop making more laws criminalizing law abiding citizens.
