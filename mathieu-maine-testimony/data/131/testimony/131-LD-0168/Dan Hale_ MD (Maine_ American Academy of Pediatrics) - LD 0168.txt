ww.maineaap.orgTestimony i n suppor t of LD 168 – ‘ An Act R egarding Criminal B ackground Checks  
for Sale, Tra nsfer or Exchange of F irearms ’ 
Senator Beebe- Center,  Representative S alisbury a nd dist inguished m embers o f 
the Committee o n Criminal Justice a nd P ublic Sa fety, my name  is Dr. Dan Hale, a 
Kittery resident an d board me mber o f the Ma ine C hapter o f the  American 
Academy o f Pediatrics. I am wr iting i n support o f LD 168 – ‘An Ac t Regarding 
Criminal Background C hecks f or Sale, T ransfer o r Exchange of Fir earms ’. 
As a father,  pediatrician,  and responsible f irearm owner I s upport c ommonsense 
measures to p revent f irearm violence. T here is n o “easy” u nifying i ntervention 
that will e nd firearm violence,  but t here  are s everal measures t hat c an mo ve u s in 
the rig ht directio n of saving l ives. T hese t hree Acts s trengt hen existing l aws fo r 
safe transfer and sales of f irearms w ithout re stricting t he rights o f responsible 
Maine h unters a nd sports enthusiasts. 
There  is a lo ng h istory o f responsible f irearm ownership in M aine. Famili es have 
been hunting and fi shing to gether for c enturies. However,  it is a lso t rue t hat rat es 
of suicide are higher in h omes w ith firearms a nd inappropriate  access t o firearms 
can endanger o thers. T hese le gislative e fforts are a good balance o f protecting 
those  rights while taking real  steps t o keep weapons from those  seeking to cause 
harm. LD 22, 60 and 168 a re all proposals that Maine citizens should be able to 
support.  
Thank you for keeping our communities sa fe, 
Dan Hale, M.D.,FAAP,  SFHM
