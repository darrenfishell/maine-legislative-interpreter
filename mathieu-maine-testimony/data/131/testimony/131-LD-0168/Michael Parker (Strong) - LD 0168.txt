Vote NO on LD 168 - An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, 
Transfer or Exchange of Firearms.  STRONGLY OPPOSE.  Maine has a great 
outdoors tradition, and this involves the responsible, safe use of firearms. We are not 
the safest, or nearly so, state for gun ownership for no reason.   This law is obstructive
to the free exercise of our constitutional rights and heritage, and is NOT needed.   
Laws that are not necessary are BAD LAWS.
Thank you.
