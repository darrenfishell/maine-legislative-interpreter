LD 168
I oppose LD 168, An Act Regarding Criminal Background Checks for the Sale, 
Transfer or Exchange of Firearms. This bill is a dangerous stepping stone to banning 
ALL private firearm sales in the future. Private citizens should NOT need permission 
to sell private property, be it at home or at a gun show. This is an infringement on our 
Second Amendment rights afforded by the US and Maine Constitutions. This bill 
must not become law.
