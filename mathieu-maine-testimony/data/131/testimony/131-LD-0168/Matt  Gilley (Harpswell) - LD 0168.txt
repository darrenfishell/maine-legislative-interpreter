Ld 168
Good afternoon Senator Beebe-Center and representative Salisbury and distinguished 
members of the criminal justice and public safety committee. My name is Matthew 
Gilley and I am a lifelong resident of Harpswell. I am writing to you today in 
opposition of ld 168. I feel like a broken record on this subject. 7 years ago 13 of the 
16 counties and the majority of the maine population voted this down and each year 
concurrently I have come and testified against a bill along these lines. For 7 years the 
maine people have spoken that we don’t want to make criminals out law abiding gun 
owners. This would make me a criminal if I let my brother in law borrow my gun to 
hunt with. If I let a friend try a new gun at the range I would become a criminal. The 
current background check system we have now is broken. Crimes are not being 
reported in a timely basis and people that should not be passing checks are. So before 
we make more laws let’s fix the laws we have. I hope yet again you follow the will of 
the maine people and vote ought not to pass. Thank you
