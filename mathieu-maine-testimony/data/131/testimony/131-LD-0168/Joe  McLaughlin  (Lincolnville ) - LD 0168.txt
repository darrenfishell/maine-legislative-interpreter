Joe  McLaughlin 
Lincolnville 
LD 168
Members of the committee on criminal justice and public safety,
My name is Joe McLaughlin, I’m a resident of Lincolnville.
I’m opposed to LD168 for a few reasons.  This bill seems to be a solution searching 
for a problem as Maine is already one of the safest states in the nation.  
On top of this, the people of Maine have been asked if they want rules requiring 
background checks in recent years and overwhelmingly rejected those measures 
multiple times.  
Another issue I see with this bill is that it undermines the second amendment.   We 
have these rights for a reason and requiring interaction with the government in order 
to exercise them defeats the purpose.    I can’t think of any other Constitutional rights 
that require such a process to wade through in order to exercise.   
Thank you for your time.
