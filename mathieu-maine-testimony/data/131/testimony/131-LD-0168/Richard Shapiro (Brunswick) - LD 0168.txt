Please oppose this bill.
    This bill is simply universal background checks – a proposal that the voters of this 
state soundly rejected several years ago, despite a massive expenditure of out of state 
cash on behalf of the proposal.
    The citizens of the state of Maine rejected the proposal then for a number of very 
good reasons.  Those reasons have not changed.
    Let’s start with the obvious.  Criminals don’t obey laws.  Criminals don’t get 
background checks.  This law only slams law abiding gun owners.  There are states 
that have this provision in place.  They have higher crime rates than we do here.  
    And, the law is utterly unenforceable.  It only works if there is a registration of 
each firearm.  There is no record in this state of who owns a firearm, and there is no 
way know how or when it was transferred to that person.  
    Furthermore, this law strips 18-21 year-olds of their 2nd Amendment Right to own 
a pistol.  Why?  Because pistol background checks are only available to those over 21 
years of age.  But, at 18 you can serve in the army, serve as a police officer, and vote. 
    And, the federal instant check system is also deeply flawed.  More than 90% of 
those flagged – those denied their constitutional right to purchase a firearm, to carry a 
firearm, to defend themselves, are false positives.  Sorting out that mess, when it can 
be sorted out, can take, at best, days, and at worst months.
    Lastly, many, if not most, gun shops now charge $50 to do those background 
checks, when they’re open, and where they are.  That’s a heck of a tax to place on 
poor Maine folks who seek to use their constitutional rights!
Again, please oppose this bad bill.
