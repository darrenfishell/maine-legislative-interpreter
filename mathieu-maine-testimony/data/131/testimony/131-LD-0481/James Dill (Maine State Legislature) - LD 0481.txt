Testimony of Rep. James Dill introducing 
LD 481, An Act to Allow the Deferral of a Moose Hunting Permit If More 
than One Permit Is Awarded Within the Same Household 
Before the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and distinguished members of the Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife Committee, my name is Jim Dill, and I represent House District 26 and the 
communities of Bradley, Old Town and Penobscot Indian Island. I am here before you today to 
present LD 481, An Act to Allow the Deferral of a Moose Hunting Permit If More than One 
Permit Is Awarded Within the Same Household. 
This bill allows a holder of a valid moose hunting pennit to defer the pennit to the next hunting 
season if another person in the household also holds a valid moose hunting permit for the same 
hunting season. 
I’ve heard from several hunters who have gotten 2 and even 3 moose permits in one household 
for the year some were in the same season and some were in different seasons. They admit it 
truly is the hunt of a lifetime, but it can be trying to do 2 in one year, not to mention the amount 
of meat, if all are successful. Then all the meat packages must be meticulously labelled before 
they can be given away. 
I had actually heard from people with multiple family permits who didn’t live in the same 
household would also like to defer, but I thought that would be more difﬁcult to track. Hence,I 
thought using the same address to track the permits, would be a good starting point, 
Thank you for your time and attention. I am happy to answer any questions you have of me.
