Testimony in favor of LD 1384 - An Act to Promote Fairness in the Taxation of Adult Use Cannabis by 
Basing the Excise Tax on the Tier of a Cultivation Facility. 
Good afternoon, Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and Members of the Committee on Taxation, 
My name is Joshua Quint, l am the Director of Operations for Canuvo, a Maine owned and operated 
cannabis company with licenses in both Medical and Adult Use Programs. 
l speak today in support of LD 1384, An Act to Promote Fairness in the Taxation of Adult Use Cannabis by 
Basing the Excise Tax on the Tier of a Cultivation Facility. The current excise tax provision of the Maine 
Adult Use Cannabis program is a burden to Maine businesses and unresponsive to remarkable shifts in 
this young industry. 
Prices for utilities, materials and labor have all risen remarkably over the past few years, for everybody. 
But unlike most businesses, Cannabis companies have not been able to participate in many supportive 
programs at both the state and federal level. Concurrent with these problems, cannabis prices have 
fallen. These conditions together call for relief. 
Supporting LD 1384 will decrease the Adult Use Cannabis excise tax on a scale depending on the sized of 
the cultivation operation. This will give a reprieve to Maine businesses who are subjected to severe 
economic headwinds, but it will do the most good for the smallest Maine business owners. l urge you to 
support LD 1384. Thank you for your time and consideration.
