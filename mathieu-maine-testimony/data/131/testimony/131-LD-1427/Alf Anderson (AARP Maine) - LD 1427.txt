AARP MAINE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT   
 
LD 1427:  AN ACT TO CLARIFY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION’S AUTHORITY TO 
CONSIDER THE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME CUSTOMER RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS  
 
Good afternoon,  Chairs Lawrence and Zeigler  and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology. I am Alf Anderson , Advocacy and Outreach 
Director for AARP Maine.  
 
AARP is a non -profit, non -partisan social mission organization with m ore than 200,000 
members across the state. We work on a range of energy issues at the state level. The core 
principles we approach this work with include affordability, access to utility service, reliability, 
and accountability. We support low -income energ y assistance programs. We also support 
coordination of outreach and enrollment in such programs.  
 
AARP Maine is pleased to offer testimony in support of LD 1427 sponsored by Representative 
Zeigler.  This bill requires the Commission to consider the impact of its rates and rate design 
decisions on low-income  residential ratepayers.  This bill is important for several reasons.  
 
First, electricity rates are regressive in that they require a higher percentage of household 
income to be paid for essential electri city service for lower income and fixed income 
customers compared to higher income customers.  Even though lower income customers on 
average use less energy and electricity compared to higher income customers, their bills 
comprise a high percentage of hous ehold income for these customers.1  According to the U.S. 
Census, there are 593,000 occupied households in Maine, and 107,626 household have a 
 
1 U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy publishes Low  
Income Affordability Data:  
Low-income households face a disproportionately higher energy burden. Energy burden  
is defined as the percentage of g ross household income spent on energy costs. According  
to DOE's Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool the national average  
energy burden for low -income households is 8.6%, three times higher than for non -low income  
households which is estimated at 3%. In some areas, depending on location and  
income, energy burden can be as high as 30%. Of all U.S. households, 44%, or about 50  
million, are defined as low-income .

 household income of $25,000 or less.2  This is below the qualification criteria for LIHEAP in 
Maine.3   Addit ionally , Maine’s electricity rates are expensive (being roughly double the 
national average ). They are burdensome for all customers.  
 
Second, Maine does not provide bill payment assistance f or the electric bill to the vast 
majority of those qualified for LIHEAP or the Commission’s Low Income Assistance Program 
(LIAP).  Maine’s LIHEAP serves roughly 18 % of those eligible for the program and the majority 
of its assistance is paid to fuel oil de alers not electricity utilities.  I attach the Maine fact sheet 
on our LIHEAP program for 202 1 to my testimony.  
 
As a result, it is vital that the Commission be given a directive to focus on gathering evidence 
and consider that evidence in its consideratio n of rate impacts and rate design programs for 
electricity customers.  For example, many rate designs and rate proposals will have an even 
more regressive impact on lower income customers compared to higher income customers 
and those facts need to be consi dered  in the Commission’s decision -making  process.  
 
At a time  when we are entering into programs funded by ratepayers to achieve the State’s 
electrification goals, AARP Maine seeks to ensure that these programs and policies do not fall 
unfairly on those mo st unable to pay for investments to take advantage of these policies .  
 
For all the reasons cited above we urge you to vote in support of this important legislation.  
Thank you for your consideration of our views.  
 
Sincerely,  
Alf Anderson  
Associate State Director, Advocacy & Outreach

$34,545 qualifies for LIHEAP at 150% of poverty guidelines.  
https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/profiles/povertytables/FY2023/mesmi.htm  And a household of 3  with an annual 
income of less than $49,852 qualifies for LIHEAP at the 60% of median state household income criteria.
