Testimony in Support of LD 655, An Act to Address Climate Change by Reducing Carbon 
Emissions from State Vehicles 
To the State and Local Government Committee 
by Josh Caldwell, ‘Climate and Clean Energy Outreach Coordinator 
March 31, 2023~
I 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover" , and members of the Committee on State and Local 
Government, my name is Josh Caldwell. I am the Climate & Clean Energy Outreach Coordinator 
at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. NRCM has been working for more than 60 years to 
protect, restore, and conserve Maine’s environment, on behalf of our 25,000 members and 
supporters. I’m here today totestify in support of LD 655, An Act to Address Climate Change by 
Reducing Carbon Emissions from State Vehicles.A 
*7 
Maine’s Bipartisan Climate Action Plan identifies reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the 
transportation sector as “Plan A” in our state’s approach to combatting the climate cr"isis.1 More 
than half of Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector, and as such, 
the goals laid out to increase the number of electric vehicles (EVS) on the road in Maine are 
perhaps the most ambitious of any in the plan. Achieving these goals can start with the state 
leading by example on vehicle electrification.‘ 
The Clean Transportation Roadmap, commissioned in 2021 to establish a pathway for reducing 
emissions from the transportation sector, identifies vehicle electrification as the most impactful5 
strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector? The 3,773 vehicles' 
under State ownership represent a major opportunity to mitigate climate impacts and support the 
EV infrastructure needed to achieve the vehicle electrification goals laid out in the Climate 
Action Plan? , 
Last year, LD 1579, An Act to Transition State and Local Motor Vehicle Fleets to Zero-emission 
Vehicles, was signed into law. This legislation made great strides toward establishing goals and 
timetables to increase the percentage of zero-emission and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the State 
light-duty vehicle ﬂeet. This legislation also set goals for school districts to increase the 
percentage of zero-emission school buses in Maine, and we’ve seen progress on that front within 
the past year alone. The goals set out by LD 1579, however, are not binding, and apply only toa 
portion of the commercially available EV market. 'V

The electric vehicle market is maturing quickly, and electric vehicles in every vehicle class 
ranging from.light- to heavy-duty are commercially available right now.“ More zero-emission 
models are coming onto the scene each year, driving down the price of electric vehicles relative 
to their combustion engine counterparts. The clean energy transition must center around cost- 
effective solutions, and We are seeing evidence that new zero-emission vehicles often have a' 
lower lifetime cost of ownership than equivalent new .cornbustion engine vehicles. Our survey of 
electric vehicle owners in 2022 found that more than half of Maine’s EV drivers are saving at 
least $50/month on fuel costs, and 97% of respondents said their EV is easy and affordable to 
maintain.5 A 2022 analysis by Car and Driver found that the three-year cost of a new Ford F-150 
Lightning is lower than that of a new Ford F-150 combustion engine tn1ck.6 Investing in EVsF 
now will result in dividends for the state from a financial and climate perspective. 
LD 655 represents an opportunity to build upon the success of LD 157 9 and further enable the 
State to lead by example on combatting climate change and lowering fleet operating costs 
through vehicle electrification. When appropriate, new vehicles purchased by the State must be 
zero-emission moving forward. We are open to seeing this guidance phased in over time as the 
state adjusts to a rapidly expanding EV market. _ 
For these reasons, we urge the Committee to vote Ought To Pass on this important legislation. I 
am happy to answer any questions you may have.
