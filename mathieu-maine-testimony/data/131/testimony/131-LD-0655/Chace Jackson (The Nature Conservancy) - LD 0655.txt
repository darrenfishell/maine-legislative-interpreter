RE: LD 655 – An Act to Address Climate Change by Reducing Carbon Emissions from State Vehicles 
 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and 
Local Government, my name is Chace Jackson and I am here to testify on behalf of my The Nature 
Conservancy in Maine. I appreciate this opportunity to testify in support of LD 655, An Act to Address 
Climate Change by Reducing Carbon Emissions from State Vehicles.  
 
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a nonprofit conservation organization dedicated to conserving the 
lands and waters on which all life depends. Guided by science, we create innovative, on-the-ground 
solutions to our world’s toughest challenges so that nature and people can thrive together. We use a 
collaborative approach that engages local communities, governments, the private sector, and other 
partners. The Nature Conservancy has been leading conservation in Maine for more than 60 years and is 
the 12th largest landowner in the state, owning and managing roughly 300,000 acres. We also work 
across Maine to restore rivers and streams, partner with fishermen in the Gulf of Maine to rebuild 
groundfish populations, and develop innovative solutions to address our changing climate. 
 
As we face the ongoing challenges of climate change, it is crucial that we take bold action to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more sustainable, clean energy future. This bill represents 
an important step in that direction. LD655 requires that the Central Fleet Management Division and the 
Department of Public Safety purchase or lease only zero-emission battery electric vehicles, to the extent 
that a suitable vehicle is commercially available. This measure will help to reduce the carbon footprint of 
state vehicles and promote the adoption of clean, renewable energy sources. 
 
The Maine Climate Action Plan recognizes the importance of reducing emissions from the transportation 
sector, which is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing the use of electric 
vehicles in state fleets, LD655 will help to lead the way towards a cleaner, more sustainable future. It 
will also help to stimulate the market for electric vehicles and encourage the development of new 
technologies and infrastructure to support their use. In addition, this bill will provide economic benefits 
to the state, as electric vehicles are generally more cost-effective to operate and maintain than 
traditional vehicles. By reducing fuel and maintenance costs, the state can save money and invest in 
other critical priorities. 
 
We urge you to support LD655 and take bold action to address climate change and promote clean 
energy in Maine. By leading the way on electric vehicle adoption, we can help to reduce emissions and 
build a more sustainable, prosperous future for our state. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD655. I am happy to answer questions about this 
bill at any time.
