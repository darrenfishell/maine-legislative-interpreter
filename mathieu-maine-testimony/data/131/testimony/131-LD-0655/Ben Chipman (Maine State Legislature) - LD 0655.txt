Testimony of Senator Ben Chipman introducing LD 655, “An Act to Address Climate 
Change by Reducing Carbon Emissions from State Vehicles ” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government 
March 31, 2023 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and Distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on State and Local Goverment, my name is Ben Chipman, and I represent Senate 
District 28, which includes part of Portland of Cumberland County. I am before you today to 
introduce LD 65 5, “An Act to Address Climate Change by Reducing Carbon Emissions from 
State Vehicles. ” 
This legislation would establish goals for Central Fleet Management Division and Department of 
Public Safety to purchase or lease plug-in hybrid electric or Zero-emission vehicles to be used as 
State vehicles, as long as the the purpose of the vehicle is not affected and that these vehicles are 
commercially available. 
The climate crisis has been affecting our state for years, evident by the vastly changing 
temperatures from the arctic Weekend to the 40 degree days in January. Driving is the not only 
harmful to the environment, but it is also the most common mode of transportation in Maine. By 
incentivizing the State government to use hybrid or zero-emission vehicles, we would be doing 
our part to help combat the impending crisis of climate change. 
Thank you for your consideration and time. I would be happy to answer any questions that you 
may have.
