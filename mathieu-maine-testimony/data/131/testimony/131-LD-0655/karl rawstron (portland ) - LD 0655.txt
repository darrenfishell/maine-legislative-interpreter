According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association since 1981 global temperatures have risen at twice their 
historic rate per decade.    
 
The Gulf of Me Research Institute reports the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99% of the global ocean.   
 
Climate.gov reports the 10 warmest years in the historical record have all occurred since 2010 
 
The polar ice cap has melted in half since 1980. 
 
Scientist globally say we’re are in the midst of a 6th Mass Extinction 
 
This LD 655 is a good bill, it's a good measure. 
 
California, Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey have banned the sale of new gasoline 
powered vehicles by 2035. 
 
Canada has also banned the sale of new gasoline powered vehicles by 2035 
 
General Motors has vowed to phase out petroleum-powered cars and trucks and sell only zero emission vehicles by 2035 
 
Ford is aiming for electric vehicles to make up 40% of global sales by 2030 
 
According to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection “CO2 emissions from combustion of fossil fuels account 
for 60% of Maine's 2019 gross Green House Gas emissions.”   
 
And “...the transportation sector was responsible for 49% of Maine's CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in 
2019.” 
 
Maine’s goal of becoming carbon neutral only means we’re gambling on our forests to absorb all the carbon we’re 
emitting and not factoring carbon from other places drifting in.   
 
Switching to Electric Vehicles is a great timely measure.   
 
The State Vehicle fleet has 3773 vehicles in it.  Minus DOT’s 1060 is 2713.   
 
The replacement of the state fleet will happen at an even pace.  This is not an all at once bill. 
Over the past five years we've replaced about 225 vehicles a year.  Last year we replaced 220 vehicles.  Less than 10% of 
the fleet on average each year.  In 2019 we purchased 5 electric vehicles, in 2021 2 EVs, in 2022 11 EVs.  We currently 
have 18 EVs in the state fleet.  Less than .5% of the state fleet.   
 
John Brady at Senator King's office told me States are eligible for the 45W Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit under the 
Inflation Reduction Act.  And may also select a direct pay option   
 
This bill is flexible and allows for if the electric vehicle is commercially available or not and if the electric vehicle will 
suit the purposes for which the vehicle is intended or not. It's not inflexible.  
 
Going electric will also curb our dependence on foreign oil from questionable sources and keep the money in the state 
paying CMP for electricity.  It'll be good for national security.   
 
Buying electric vehicles for the state fleet moving forward is a good measure.
