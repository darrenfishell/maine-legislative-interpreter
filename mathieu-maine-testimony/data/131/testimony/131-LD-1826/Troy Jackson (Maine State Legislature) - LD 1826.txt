Testimony in Support of LD 1826 
”An Act to Designate Deer Wintering Areas Under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of 
Parks and Lands" 
Presented to the Ioint Standing Committee on lnland Fisheries and Wildlife 
May 8, 2023 
Good morning Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. My name is Troy Jackson and l have the 
honor of serving as Senate President representing the good people of Aroostook County in the 
Maine Legislature. l'm here today to introduce LD 1826, "An Act to Designate Deer Wintering 
Areas Under the Jurisdiction of the Bureau of Parks and Lands." 
This bill is a continuation of efforts by this committee last year to engage the Department of 
lnland Fisheries and Wildlife as a result of a bill l introduced, LD 1965 "An Act to Create Higher 
Standards for State-owned and State-managed Land for Deer Management." The bill before 
you today is a much more comprehensive piece of legislation that will empower the Bureau of 
Parks and Lands to designate ”deer wintering area" in consultation with the Department of 
lnland Fisheries and Wildlife. This coordination will ensure not just that land is designated and 
protected, but will receive the highest management priority. 
ln Aroostook County, hunting is not simply a way of life but also an economic driver. Camps, 
guides, outfitting supplies, rentals and hotels all depend on deer hunting as a key part of their 
business model. Ensuring that habitats where deer winter, but are not protected, can be 
surveyed and managed in a way that reflects their importance will not just support the deer 
population, but also the many people and businesses who rely on it. 
I'm glad to bring LD 1826 forward and l am thankful for the efforts of the Sportsman's Alliance 
of Maine to continue working on this issue and working to create a more extensive and 
effective structure for deer habitat management. Thank you for your time and l’m happy to 
take any questions.
