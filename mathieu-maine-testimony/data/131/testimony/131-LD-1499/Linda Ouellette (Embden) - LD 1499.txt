My name is Linda Ouellette  and I  resid e in Embden, Maine.  I was a  Maine State Employee for over 26  
years, retiring in 2011 with a penalty of 42 percent of my MEPERS pension  but able to continue being 
covered by health insurance .  When first beginning employment in September 1985,  I was told  once 
vested you would be eligible for health insurance for life.  Many changes happened over the years that 
were not beneficial  to me pe rsonally , the final straw was in 2011 with the 6% penalty for every year you 
retired early and the threat to health insurance (if you didn’t retire early, you were not eligible for State 
health insurance until reaching 62 years of age).  At that time  I was  54 ½  years old , my priorities were 
with  aging parents, my husband’s medical conditions, along with my own medical condition,  and I felt I 
could  not count on any future career with State government.  Having worked prior to State government, 
I found my Soc ial Security was also reduced  via Windfall Elimination and Government Pension Offset , in 
addition  I was responsible to pay the Medicare premium as well.  I continue to work part -time in the 
private sector to make ends meet.  Passing LD 1499  reducing the 6% penalty for folks who had chosen to 
retire early in 2011 to keep their health insurance, to a 2.25% penalty would certainly help my situation  
and my independence .  Thank you for your time.  
Respectfully,  
Linda Ouellette
