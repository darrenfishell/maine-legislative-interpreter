TESTIMONY OF JEFF MCCABE 
MAINE SERVICE EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, SEIU LOCAL 1989, 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HOUSING 
APRIL 19, 2023 
IN SUPPORT OF LD 1499 
AN ACT REGARDING PENALTIES FOR EARLY RETIREMENT FOR CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE MAINE PUBLIC 
EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM 
SPONSORED BY REPRESENTATIVE DAN SHAGOURY 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on Labor and Housing, my 
name is Jeff McCabe, Director of Politics and Legislation for the Maine Service Employees Association, 
Service Employees International Union Local 1989 (MSEA-SEIU Local 1989). We are a labor union 
representing approximately 13,000 workers and retirees, mainly in the public sector, statewide. We 
respectfully ask you to support LD 1499. 
LD 1499 address an unintended consequence of the enormous pension and healthcare cuts the 125th 
Maine Legislature imposed on state employees and others effective July 1, 2011 â€” an unintended 
consequence compounded by other pension cuts that took effect back in 1993. 
In 2011, legislators decided that state contributions toward retiree health insurance would begin at the 
normal retirement age (60 or 62) for workers vested in the retirement system as ofJune 30, 2011. As 
part of this transition, workers who had at least 25 years of service as ofJuly 1, 2011, but who had not 
yet reached their normal retirement age, were required to retire by Dec. 31, 2011, in order to have fully 
paid health insurance immediately upon retiring. Otherwise, their eligibility for fully paid health 
insurance would not kick in until they reached normal retirement age. 
As a result, some state workers who had at least 25 years of service but were not yet at normal 
retirement age determined they had no choice but to retire by Dec. 31, 2011, in order to gain access to 
retiree health insurance. This meant they had to take a penalty of 6 percent per year for each year they 
retired prior to normal retirement age. A worker who was five years short of normal retirement age, for 
example, took a 30-percent hit to their pension in order to access retiree health insurance - even 
though they already had attained at least 25 years of service. lt's also important to know that the6 
percent annual retirement penalty is traced to changes the Legislature made to the retirement system in 
1993. Under those changes, participants in the retirement system as ofJuly 1, 1993, who did not have 
10 years of creditable service, were required to have at least 25 years of service and attain age 62 in 
order to avoid the 6 percent annual penalty. Prior to that change, the penalty was 2.25 percent for each 
year below 60 years of age the person retired. 
LD 1499 provides a solution for those workers who felt they were forced to choose, back in 2011, 
between getting retiree health insurance or taking a 6 percent annual hit to their pensions. The solution 
in LD 1499 is to change the rate of the penalty for those state employees and teachers who retired 
between July 1, 2011 and January 1, 2012, and who had at least 25 years of service as ofJuly 1, 2011, 
but had not yet attained 62 years of age. We think it's the right thing to do for these public employees, 
and we encourage you to support LD 1499. Thank you and I would be glad to answer any questions.
