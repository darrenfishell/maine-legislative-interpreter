Testimony of Adam Geode, Maine AFL-CIO Legislative & Political Director, ln Support of LD 1499 “An 
Act Regarding Penalties for Early Retirement for Certain Members of the Maine Public Employees 
Retirement System” 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor & Housing, 
my name is Adam Goode. I am the Legislative & Political Director of the Maine AFL-CIO. We represent 
40,000 working men and women in the state of Maine. We work to improve the lives and working conditions of 
our members and all working people. 
LD I499 helps address the struggle of public sector retirees. There are many ways in which state employees. 
educators, corrections ofﬁcers and public sector workers are disadvantaged in their retirement. For most of 
these retirees, the pensions they contributed to through MEPERS are their main source of income. Most of these 
workers do not receive social security. 
There were enormous pension and healthcare cuts in the 125th l\/laine Legislature, including a decision that state 
contributions toward retiree health insurance would begin at the normal retirement age (60 or 62) for workers 
vested in the retirement system as of June 30, 201 l. As part of this transition, workers who had at least 25 years 
of service as ofJuly l, 201 1, but who had not yet reached their normal retirement age. were required to retire by 
Dec. 31. 201 1. in order to have fully paid health insurance immediately upon retiring. Otherwise, their 
eligibility for fully paid health insurance would not kick in until they reached normal retirement age. 
The impact of this policy change was some state workers with at least 25 years of service, but who were not yet 
of the normal retirement age, decided they should retire by the end of 2011. They made this decision in order to 
have access to retiree health insurance, despite taking a penalty of 6 percent per year for each year they retired 
prior to normal retirement age. This was an unfair choice to put upon state employees. 
To make the matter worse, there was no ﬁscal crises requiring the expectation that state employees chose to 
either accept a retirement penalty or forgo fully paid health insurance. That session"s budget included 
prioritization of a large tax cut that predominately benefited the wealthy. which is the major reason why state 
employees were asked to make such sacriﬁces. 
LD 1499 ﬁxes this problem by changing the rate of the penalty for those state employees and teachers who 
retired between July l, 201 l and January 1, 2012, and who had at least 25 years of service as ofJuly l, 2011, 
but had not yet attained 62 years of age. LD 1499 is one of many bills before your committee that can help 
public sector retirees get back on the right track. We ask that you vote ought to pass.
