Labor and Housing Committee (Cross Office Building room 202) 
Wednesday, April 19 at 10:00am 
Hello Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and esteemed members 
of the Committee on Labor and Housing 
My name is Gordeen Skolfield, I am from the western Maine town of 
Weld near Mount Blue State Park. 
I would like to speak in support of LD1499: An Act Regarding Penalties 
for Early Retirement. 
l was an employee of the Maine Department of Conservation, Bureau 
of Parks and Lands for 28 years. I started in 1983 with the expectation 
of being eligible for retirement at age 60 with a penalty of 2.25% for 
every year under age 60. ln 1993 the retirement eligibility was changed 
to age 62 with a penalty of 6% for every year under age 62. I missed 
that cut off (or ‚ÄùCliff") by 28 days. 
I had to retire in 2011 to secure my Health Insurance. I was 58 years old 
so I was 4 years under age 62. l ended my time of service with a 24% 
penalty. I feel the terms and conditions of my employment were 
arbitrarily changed twice in the course of my employment, once with 
regards to Retirement Eligibility and once for Insurance Eligibility. 
As a former State Employee with little Social Security l depend on as 
much of my full pension as I can get. I would appreciate anything this 
Legislature can do to correct this unfortunate circumstance. 
Thank you for hearing me. I would be happy to answer any questions 
the committee may have.
