Testimony of Leo J. Delicata, Esq., Legal Services for the Elderly, in support of 
L.D. 196 An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Probate and Trust 
Law Advisory Commission for Amending the Maine Uniform Probate Code 
and Related Provisions of Law before the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary. 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary. 
Legal Services for the Elderly is a non-proﬁt legal services organization that 
was established in Maine following the passage of the federal Older 
American ’s Act in 1974. Since that time, we have provided free legal 
assistance to our disadvantaged older adults when their basic human needs 
are at stake. Our clients are all aged sixty or older and most have very low 
incomes. 
In the course of our work we have been involved in reviewing, discussing 
and commenting on the body of information that became the Title 18-C, the 
Maine Uniform Probate Code. As a result of that experience and work on 
subsequent amendments, we witnessed the consistent excellent quality of 
thought that the members of the Probate and Trust Law Advisory 
Commission brought to these discussions. Their work honored the product 
of the Uniform Law Commission but it also presented intelligent adaptations 
that reﬂected the current and evolving needs of Maine people. In similar 
fashion, they continue to build on their past work as evidenced by the 
proposal before you today. 
We are offering this testimony in order to publicly support the amendments 
that they have included in this bill. We agree with their current suggestions 
and hope that you will vote this bill “ought to pass”. 
Thank you for giving us this opportunity to comment.
