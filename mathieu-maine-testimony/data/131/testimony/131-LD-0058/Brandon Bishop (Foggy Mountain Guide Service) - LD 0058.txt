Registered Maine Guide Brandon Bishop 
Testimony in Opposition to LD 58 
Resolve, Directing the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to Establish Seasons That Do Not 
Overlap for Hunting Bear over Bait and Hunting Bear with Dogs 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the committee, I am Brandon Bishop andI 
own and operate Foggy Mountain Guide service. I am here today to strongly ask you oppose LD 58. The 
ﬁnancial burden it would put on myself and other houndsmen in the state would be devastating. 
Shortening the hound season by 2 weeks would cost me upwards of $32,000 a year. Many houndsmen 
already loose the last week or 2 of the hound season due to bears going to den, making the ﬁrst 2 weeks 
of the season the best opportunity for us hound hunters to be in the woods. Recently the 10-year big 
game management plan was done with much thought and shortening the hound season never came 
about. Approximately 30 years ago there was conﬂict due to hound and bait hunting starting at the same 
time. Hound hunters agreed to give up the ﬁrst 2 weeks of the season to let the bait hunters have the 
woods to themselves. LD 58 would now give bait hunters one whole month to themselves while our 
hounds sit idle. Inland ﬁsheries and wildlife recently enacted the hound trespass bill which gives them 
authority to resolve any criminal activity done by bad apples in the hound world. Between the hound 
trespass law and the many regulations that large landowners have in place there is little conﬂict in the 
woods between bait hunters and hound hunters. I believe this bill is for an isolated case and ask you to 
oppose LD 58. I appreciate your time. Thank you! Brandon Bishop
