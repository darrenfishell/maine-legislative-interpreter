“Resolve, Directing the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and  
Wildlife to Establish Seasons That Do Not Overlap for Hunting  
Bear over Bait and Hunting Bear with Dogs ”. 
TO 
Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW)

Senator LaFountain , Representative Landry , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife , my name is Nathan Theriault owner of OMM Outfitters in Eagle 
Lake  testifying in opposition  to L.D. 58. OMM has offered bear hunts in Aroostook County for 
almost 20 years.  Durin g the bear season OMM employ s 5 – 8 guides.  
 
OMM offers  bear hunts for 6 weeks starting at the end of August. The first two weeks are 
dedicated to hunting over bait. These weeks book quickly, often two years in advance , and the 
success rate  is high.  
 
Interest in bait hunts declines after week 2. The overlap of bait and hound hunts during weeks 
3 and 4 , help  achieve bookings and thus harvest goals . Moreover, t hese w eeks are popular for 
sponsored and family hunts since hunters with mobility issues and those wanting a fast -paced 
hunt can be at the lodge together. Some  hunters opt for a combination hunt with hounds in 
the morning and over bait in the aftern oon. Thus, because of the overlap, compared with 
weeks 1 and 2, the total revenue can be greater . 
 
In my experience, conflict between baiting and hounding is isolated and has been resolved 
with communication and on occasion with landowner help.   
 
OMM pre fers avoiding such changes to the bear hunting seasons.  Furthermore, Bills like this  
create di vision in the industry and issues should  be addressed in other ways.  
 
Thank you.
