Dale  Tobey 
Grand lake stream 
LD 58
I am Dale Tobey from grand lake stream ME. I'm writing this testimony in opposition
to LD58. This state cannot afford to take away any more tools in the management of 
our bear populations. I can't see any way to do away with the overlap other than 
taking them 2 weeks away from the hound hunters. The hound hunters have already 
given up two weeks to the bait hunters years ago. I personally don't see the problem 
with the overlap hound hunters are generally done by 1 pm where most bait hunters 
just getting started at 2pm 
Thanks for hearing me.
