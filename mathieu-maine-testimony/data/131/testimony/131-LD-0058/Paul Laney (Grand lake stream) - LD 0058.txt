Paul Laney
Grand lake stream
LD 58
Good morning members of committee.  My name is Paul Laney, I own laneys guide 
service in grand lake stream. I am writing in opposition to ld58.  I've been running a 
fairly large bear hunting operation forvthe past 25 years taking both bait and hound 
hunters, my leases border several guides and hunters who only bait hunt. In the past 
25 years I have had zero conflicts with my hounds interfering with any bait hunters. 
We have laws in place to address any conflicts that might be occurring and the 
commissioner has the power to change seasons if needed. The hound hunters have 
already sacrificed enough over the years. I urge you to all vote against this bill. Thank
you
