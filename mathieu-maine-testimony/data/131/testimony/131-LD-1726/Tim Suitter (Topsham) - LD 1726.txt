Good Mommg Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and distinguished members of the 
Health and Human Sen/ices Committee 
My Name is Tim Suitter and I am speaking in support of LD 1726 an Act to Build Maine's 
Economy~by Supporting Child Care and Working Families 
I have worked at Bath Iron Works for 25 years and counting I am a union member of Machinists 
Local S6 and the Chairman of our Legislative Committee Local S6 represents 4,300 working 
men and women at BIW I have heard the many issues surrounding child care directly from my 
co- workers Workers trying to raise families and balance childcare is harder than ever BIW is 
continuing on hinng more employees this year, but a big hurdle I see in the recruitment and 
retention of new employees is the child care cnsis we have in this state In midcoast Maine the 
issues include extensive waitlists at area programs and some programs often don't provide the 
necessary hours needed, as most don't open until 7 or later and close by 5 then there comes 
the cost which averages around 275/wk in the midcoast area How can we grow our 
communities if workers don't have access to daycare, can't afford daycare, and are forced to 
pass on working to raise their kids instead 
Personally I have dealt with childcare issues over the years I have a 16 year old son who 
started daycare at 1 years old I was a single father with primary custody of my son, fortunately I 
moved to Bath close to my jOb and in the neighborhood of creative play daycare I can't explain 
to you what that day care means to me and my child They were my family support system They 
are like family and one of the biggest parts of our community Daycares like hers allow our 
community to work and raise children in a canng social and educational environment with other 
children building the communities we live in stronger It was a real struggle for me keeping up 
with the cost of daycare and trying to raise my son We desperately need more facilities and 
people like her 
My partner Sara and I had a girl together in 2016 Sara works for LL Bean so we found day care 
for my daughter in Freeport after being on several waitlists That daycare closed in 2018, luckily 
we were on a waitlist since 2016 at another daycare when one spot opened up after we had 
been stressing over it for months, but the price increased Then Covid-19 hit and that daycare 
closed and never reopened after weeks of paying to hold her spot because nobody knew what 
was going to happen Sara was able to work from home dunng that time as we had no idea 
what we were going to do with my daughter As the pandemic went on more places closed and 
we encountered more waitlists When she was getting ready to start Kindergarten Sara was 
needing to transition back to the ofﬁce and luckily was able to work a hybnd schedule in and out 
of the ofﬁce before ﬁnding a before and after program last school year which she now attends 
Now we have the stress again of what to do for the summer between us taking vacation time 
working from home a couple days a week and being able to have her spend time with my 
mother or Sara's mother and doing a couple weeks of day camps, we really still have no idea 
The stress is beyond unbearable on working families trying to ﬁgure out daycare solutions Add 
that with inﬂation on gas and groceries and then the cost of child care and it is not manageable 
not for our family and certainly not for those starting out in jObS like ours making less money
When workmg people have to not work because they can't ﬁnd or afford chrldcare that creates 
problems |n our commun|t|es,|n busmesses, and affects our whole State We have to recognlze 
what has happened to the chrldcare Industry especrally smce the covrd pandemuc or bus|nesses 
w|ll contmue to have stafﬁng problems Workers w|ll contmue to struggle wlth balancmg 
childcare and work We need to promote Chrld Care Workers as wrthout Chrld Care Workers we 
have no workers I urge you to act now That rs why I am here today askmg for your support on 
LD1726 thank you
