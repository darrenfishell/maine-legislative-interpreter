LD 1726
Dear sirs and madams,
 
My name is Elizabeth Chesnut and I live in the town of Cumberland.  I am a parent of
a 16-month old daughter who goes to an incredible daycare in Portland two days per 
week.
 
I am writing to share my experiences with you. My daughter's daycare is full of 
warm, loving, brilliant caregivers who have been a treasure for our family. They 
support us in parenting and serve as a resource when we have questions. We trust 
them implicitly with the care of our beloved child and we feel they deserve 
appropriate compensation. I am privileged to benefit from the dedication of childcare 
workers and I hope you feel they deserve fair pay. 
It is my hope as you review legislation this session that you consider supporting 
Senator Troy Jackson’s bill, LD 1726, which supports efforts to invest in Maine’s 
system of child care by advancing compensation for educators (‘the workforce behind
the workforce’), creating affordability for families, increasing access, and maintaining
health and safety standards for children. 
 
Thank you, 
Elizabeth S. Chesnut
Cumberland, ME
