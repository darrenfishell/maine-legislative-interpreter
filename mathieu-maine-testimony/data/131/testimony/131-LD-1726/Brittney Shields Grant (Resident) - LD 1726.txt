l-lello- My name is Brittney Shietds Grant and l' 
am a parent of three children, a Maine 
State Parent Ambassador" , and a member of the parent board for Miss Jordyn's 
Childcare and Preschool E am here to testify in support of LD1726 An Act to Build 
lVlaine’s Economy by Supporting Childcare and Working Families l‘d like to stait by 
thanking you for spending so much of your time listening to testimony from parents, 
educators and administrators of childcare centers High quality childcare is hard to 
come by and expensive when available, though the benefits are abundant The National 
Association for the Education of Young Chitd (NAEYC) states that low wages area 
significant barrier to attracting and retaining qualified early childhood educators ll/lariy 
early childhood educators earn poverty-level wages, which can lead to high turnover 
rates and a lack of stability for young children This high turnover rate has a negative 
impact on the quality of care that young children receive (NAEYC 2021) According to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median hourly wage for childcare workers in 
May 2020 was $12 24, which is significantly lower than the median hourly wage for all 
workers, which was $20 17 The BLS also l'€pOl'lZS that the annual mean wage for 
childcare workers in May 2020 was $25,460, while the annual mean wage for all 
workers was $56,310 (BLS 2021) Why does it matter’? 
Because as research shows, investing in quality early childhood education can have 
significant long-term benefits, including increased earnings, improved health outcomes, 
and reduced involvement in the criminal jUStlC€ system It can also have significant 
economic benefits, including increased productivity, reduced healthcare costs, and 
decreased reliance on social welfare progiams (NAEYC 2021) 
And l know that research is helpful, but researchers aren't the ones writing my story- the 
real life accounts of childcare in the past 5 years l became a single mom of two children 
in 2018- two daughters, ages 3 and 1 l wasn’t able to secure reasonably priced 
childcare but did not qualify for assistance The choice was to pay for our food and 
housing, or pay for a childcare center A stay-at-home mom was able to watch the girls 
for me, and l relied heavily on family to watch them as well l finally located a center that 
could watch them and here comes the old adage - “you get what you pay for" Shortly 
after enrolling, when going to pick my daughter up for an appointment, l walked in to 
discover the provider napping with the youngest children in a dark room while the 3~5 
year olds were unattended at the kitchen table We pulled the children from that center 
and l\/liss Jordyn’s Childcare posted an opening not long after in December of 2019 in 
Januaiy 2020, they were able to start attending l\/liss Jord,yn’s, but my husband began 
working extra EMT shifts around his nursing casses to help accommodate the price in 
l\/larch, when the world shut down for COX/lD, these teachers set up Zoom meets with 
their classrooms When it reopened, our children were ecstatic to go back to those 
teachers 3 years later, we h’ ave lost most of their favorite teachers Yes, it might be said 
that change is natural for many people and the employees wont be there lorever And 
absolutely, some go on to ‘school based positions, but then we see the others at an 
entry level §)OSl’tl()l’l~ a cashier at a hardware store a teller at a bank, a receptionist ata 
local business They could get benefits and better pay at these positions They’re not 
neariy as passionate about paperworli. or power tools, hut they couldn't afford to live 
while employed at a childcare center These teachers build relationships so strong they 
come back to visit The tear-filled goodbyes on teachers last days are enough to ripa 
parents heart out Teaching is selﬂess absolutely selfless Sc many teachers and
(
childcare providers are scraping hy, inst to he with our kids day in and day out Jest last 
week, we got word that the after school program is only availahle 4 days a week due to 
resrgnations ln some cases, these prograni closures pull a nurse from an ER,a 
provider from a orthopedic office, or a GNA from a nursing home And one of those 
resignations ’? Another favorite teacher l’m prepping my kids for yet another heart 
wrenching goodbye Providers need to he able to pay working wages and sustain 
themselves and parents shouldn’t have to work overtime in order to afford childcare lt lS 
in no way just parents who suffer, or children, or childcare providers lt is employers it is 
hospitals It is small businesses It is Maine
