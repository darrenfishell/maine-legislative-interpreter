LD 1726 
“An Act to Build Maine’s Economy by Supporting Child Care for 
Working Families ” 
Health & Human Services Committee 
Testimony of: 
Mary-Gene Rumery 
Good morning, it IS an honor to be able to address the committee on such an important issue as Senate 
President Jackson's Child Care Blll, LD1726 My name is Mary-Gene Rumery, I am a mother of five from 
Norridgewock My children are 10, 6, 5, 3 and 8 months old and are all either adopted or fostered I tell 
you that so you will understand that the Department of Health and Human Services does not assist my 
family with securing and maintaining childcare 
Before adopting my oldest three children I had secure childcare for all of them Once we switched to 
pre-adoptive my partner and I were hit with being over income and we were informed we would have 
to pay full price for both younger children totaling $426 00 a week While we live a modest life and my 
partner and I had good employment, childcare totaling $1,704 a month was not feasible My family was 
forced to make choices such as keeping our boy with a speech dlsability in his specialized childcare and 
pulling our daughter out This also meant I could no longer be employed My partner was now the sole 
financial support for our family causing him added stress I felt like I no longer had direction or purpose 
in my life as a stay-at-home parent who was an executive assistant We began to bicker and fight, which 
was not good for anyone in the family Fast forward through Covid and the two years after I am only 
able to work part time as regularly my childcare is not stable due to child to provider ratios being too 
high Regularly I bring my youngest two to childcare and there are people we have never met there to 
cover call offs My children have anxiety and fear about the unknown and I suffer with anxiety and fear 
of the unknown My family is financially impacted by me not being able to go back into a full-time 
executive position My partner's health has been impacted by being under increased stress I am 
painfully aware that we are one of the lucky families to have childcare after Covid as many childcare 
facilities closed during and after Covid 
I am asking you to support LD1726 today because every family in Maine deserves access to quality 
childcare If every family were able to access the quality child care they need, regardless of where they 
live in Maine, we could increase workforce participation across Maine and have the potential for true 
economic growth We could make Maine stronger, more appealing and establish a promising future for 
Maine Families I urge you to put the families, the Cl’lIldI'€l'l, and the future of Maine's economic growth 
first today
