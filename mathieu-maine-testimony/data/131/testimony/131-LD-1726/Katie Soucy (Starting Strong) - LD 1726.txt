Testimony of Katie Soucy on behalf of Starting Strong 
In support of LD 1726 An Act to Build Maine's Economy by Supporting Child Care and Working 
Families 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee, my name IS Katie Soucy and I am the director of a coalition of organizations in Portland 
called Starting Strong Starting Strong works to improve outcomes for children and families in our 
community lam also the parent of a four year old and a child care consumer lam here today to testify 
in favor of LD 1726 I will be brief in my testimony but want to add my voice to the choir of support you 
are hearing 
Over the past four years, Starting Strong has focused our efforts on increasing access to high quality 
early childhood care and education as a key strategy towards supporting the overall success of young 
children, their families and our entire community Our commitment to ensuring that children and 
families receive high quality early childhood care and education IS based on research which points to 
the positive long-term success of such programming and the significant gaps which exist in Portland 
As a local coalition, we quickly came to realize that the child care crisis is a problem which not only 
plagues some families, but has slowly and certainly impacted our city, our state and nation as a whole 
As I am sure you will hear today, the issue of "solving childcare" is extremely complex and includes 
differences of perspective and approach lam here today to emphasize for you some of the key 
elements in LD1726 which Starting Strong has identified as invaluable for moving forward together 
To begin, I would like to highlight for the committee the absolute reality that the cost to providers of 
providing high~quality child care is well beyond what the majority of families can afford The crisis we 
see today is very simply the result of a market failure The truth IS that for most families to access even 
the most basic of care, early childhood educators charge rates that yield unlivable wages for 
themselves (the average early childhood education teacher wage in Cumberland County is $15 O5/hr) 
This reality, while seemingly new for those a bit removed from the child care sector, has been 
anticipated by many in the field for decades And so, here we are Seemingly at our tipping point with 
more and more families needing care in order to work and fewer and fewer early childhood educators 
entering or remaining in the field due to the dire financial outlook and competitive j0b market 
LD 1762 has the potential to play a critically needed role in both directly intervening to help limit the 
impact of the current crisis, as well as building a foundation to address the market failure that is at the 
heart of the problem 
Specifically, I would like to draw your attention to the inclusion of cost modeling and analysis in the bill 
and its role and importance in developing and assessing future policy-based solutions for the child care 
sector Cost modeling the true cost of early childhood care and education across a variety of settings 
and under various policy scenarios (such as wage supplements, investments to improve quality ,or
supporting providers with shared services hubs) can help our state better understand and ensure that 
supports are optimally allocated and effective In 2020, Starting Strong worked with national 
consultants to develop a Portland~specific cost modeling tool to assist us locally in our efforts We 
engaged providers from across settings and quality levels in its development And together, we have 
used the tool and our 2020 analysis to develop local strategies and policy solutions to support child 
care providers in maintaining financial sustainability in an evolving market (A copy of our report is 
attached ) 
At the state-level, cost modeling can be used for child care subsidy rate-setting and to allow us to make 
more effective investments to improve quality and address market failure When paired with the 
thoughtful collection and analysis of data related to accessibility of care (such as enrollment by age, 
market rates, etc) we can use cost modeling to understand how much and where key investments 
would best enable us to meet the demand for high quality early care and education in our 
communities LD1726 ensures accountability to this process at a state level by outlining key 
considerations to include and key stakeholders to engage in a cost modeling process 
While the time has passed to prevent this crisis, the path forward is made clearer with this bill Thank 
you to President Jackson for your effort and to this committee for your consideration of it here today

ll Fiscal Analysis Methodology 
Understanding the revenue streams available to support child care providers in Portland 
Prenatal to Five Fiscal Strategies (P5FS) engaged in ﬁscal mapping to identify currently available funding 
sources for birth to ﬁve services and their specific characteristics This includes the source of the funds 
(federal, state, local, private, etc ) and the administering organization, the services, goals and population 
served, and the reach or capacity of the funding Fiscal mapping, and related analysis of the results, 
supports and guides stakeholders to answer questions related to policies and regulations offunding 
streams, levels of investments, and whether investments are successfully targeted at children and 
families who are the most vulnerable and at risk The mapping process increases knowledge of funding 
in order to support decision makers in considering how to leverage funding, where to focus efforts to 
address gaps in funding and where there may be possibilities to increase the efficiency of funding 
administration and implementation 
Through this mapping and analysis approach, key stakeholders gain knowledge about current 
investments supporting both the birth to five system and individual programs, including a clear tracking 
of the funds that serve families The analysis can also identify how these investments are, or could be, 
layered to make the maximize the potential of each funding source Additionally, the fiscal analysis 
provides an intentional lens on the issue of access to services for the most vulnerable children and their 
families 
The first aspect of fiscal mapping is information gathering and investigation to fully understand the 
funding mix that supports the delivery of birth to five services to children and families in the specific 
community, region or state To support this work, a common rubric tool is used to gather answers about 
the funding streams, entities and types of programming The research and investigation, across systems 
and funding entities, begins with reviewing written materials and documentation This was augmented 
by discussions with stakeholders on the funding sources and administration of the funds to better 
understand the context The common rubric guides this process ensuring data IS collected on ages 
served, types of services, eligibility (child, family, provider), policies and regulations associated with the 
funding, administering entity, payment method, qualifications of providers, areas of alignment or 
conflict across funding, and more 
Fiscal mapping for Portland found three primary public funding streams accessed by child care 
providers 
1 Child Care Subsidy Program (CCSP) 
Maine's child care subsidy program, CCSP IS funded by the federal Child Care Development Fund 
(CCDF), administered by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services CCSP helps 
families afford child care, based on income guidelines (at or under 85% of state median income) 
and eligibility requirements (parent/guardian must be employed, in school Ol"]0b training or 
retired) Payment rates under CCSP are set based on a market rate survey, conducted every 
three years as part of the federal CCDF requirements 
2 Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) 
The federal Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides reimbursement to child care 
providers for some of the cost of food for children who qualify free, reduced-price, and paid 
meals based on family income

Strategies -I -1% 
The Maine Department of Education administers the state PreK program While the PreK 
program IS primarily offered in public schools, school districts can enter into partnerships with 
community~based organizations (CBOs) to provide public preK services in private child care 
settings 
The limited funding streams available to child care providers in Portland leaves child care programs 
relying heavily on private tuition As a result, the ability of providers to generate revenue IS tied closely 
to parental ability to pay, which varies across Portland communities 
Understanding the true cost of quality ll'l Portland 
Identifying the true cost of providing programming for young children and families is critical to 
addressing the underfunding of the system as well as addressing the capacity needs of current and 
potential early care and education programs In the early care and education space, public funding 
amounts have been determined based on the market price of child care, which in turn is constrained by 
what families can afford to pay The result IS an inequitable system, where providers who operate in 
higher-income neighborhoods can set tuition rates closer to the actual cost of programming, which in 
turn generates a higher subsidy reimbursement rate, while those in low-income communities have to 
set tuition rates lower in orderto be accessible to their community, resulting in a lower subsidy 
reimbursement rate This approach also acts as a disincentive for programs to serve children where the 
gap between what it costs to provide care and the amount families can afford to pay is greatest 
The process for funding the services and programs in the prenatal to five period represent a fragmented 
and broken model, funding that has never met the reality of the cost of the services Policymakers and 
early childhood leaders are increasingly recognizing the deficiencies of the market price-based approach 
to rate setting As states and communities across the country consider ways to stabilize and strengthen 
their early childhood systems, they are seeking ways to develop a deeper understanding of the true 
costs of operating high-quality child care and how public subsidies can cover those costs To that end, 
states and communities are seeking to develop cost estimation models as dynamic tools to estimate the 
true cost of care and understand how this cost varies based on program characteristics and policy 
choices 
A cost estimation model (CEM) can be used to understand the cost of providing child care in different 
types of programs and at varying levels of quality Distinct from a budgeting tool which would account 
for specific characteristics of a given program, a cost estimation model is intended to provide 
policymakers with an estimate of the cost of operating a child care program in their geographic region, is 
informed by provider data and representative of various types providers Cost estimation models can 
also integrate revenue modeling to understand if the revenue streams available to providers can cover 
the actual cost of care and to identify any gaps between revenue and expense lmportantly, cost 
estimation models are dynamic tools that can show both the current cost of operating, and the cost of 
operating a program with higher quality standards 
Prenatal to Five Fiscal Strategies led a process to develop a cost estimation model with child care 
revenue and expense components for Portland This process has four distinct stages as detailed in figure 
1 The first component entails engaging key community stakeholders to support the process, connect 
with child care providers, and provide input into the assumptions that underpin the model

A small work group of early care and education stakeholders was populated to support fiscal analysis 
efforts The group advised on the review of revenue sources process, planned for and reviewed the cost 
model and discussed recommendations from the overall fiscal analysis process Organizations 
represented on this work group included child care providers, community based organizations, Portland 
School District and the local Head Start/Early Head Start grantee 
Second, data was collected from licensed child care providers on their current expenses as well as the 
expenses they would incur in order to meet higher quality standards The study team conducted 
interviews directly with child care providers across Portland in the winter of 2020/2021 The interviews 
allowed the study team to fully understand the expenses providers incur as well as how quality 
standards impact these costs For example, the interviews allowed for a deeper understanding of 
staffing patterns, how programs manage quality-related activities, and the link between compensation 
and staff recruitment and retention This data, combined with data from the federal Provider Cost of 
Quality Calculator was used to develop a customized excel-based model to estimate the cost of care in 
Portland 
The development of a cost estimation model requires two primary inputs First, expense and 
revenue data from providers, as discussed above, which was gathered through interviews The 
second input is a quality frame, which identifies the key cost drivers within the standards programs 
are required to meet To develop this quality frame for Portland's model, close review of state 
licensing standards, and quality requirements under Maine Roads To Quality, the state's quality 
rating and improvement system were completed The quality requirements that come with a cost 
were identified, and then a value was assigned, which were informed by the provider data 
gathering This model was vetted with the stakeholder advisory group 
Finally, in order to demonstrate the impact of different variables, the model was used to run several 
scenarios, illustrating the cost of care for programs with different characteristics These scenarios inform 
the recommendations detailed in this report As part of the model development and scenario running 
work, outputs and analysis from the cost model was brought to several stakeholder groups in the 
Portland community The input ofthese stakeholder presentations informed the functioning of the 
model and the recommendations developed for the Portland early care and education community 
Using Portland's cost estimation model 
Revenue and expense models are tools used to understand the relationship between the expense of 
delivering early care and education and the available revenues P5FS developed two revenue and

expense model for Portland, one for center-based settings and one for family child care home-based 
programs The models’ output includes estimates of total revenues and expenses at the provider level 
and at the individual child level to fully explicate variations in expenses and revenues for different ages 
of children Expense data in the model is based on a combination of data collected from providers across 
Portland through individual interviews and nationally validated default data from the federal Provider 
Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC) The model uses Maine state licensing requirements and quality 
variables within Maine Roads to Quality (M RTQ) in order to estimate the true cost of quality Both 
licensing and MRTQ requirements were reviewed with the work group in order to identify cost drivers 
within these standards_Table 1 in the Appendices details the licensing or quality requirements that were 
identified as having a cost associated with them 
Revenue data includes the revenue streams available to providers in Portland, including private tuition 
The model allows the user to modify various quality-related elements as well as select default quality 
levels aligned with Maine Roads to Quality standards

lll Recommendations 
1 Maximizing available funding streams and community system role in supporting this 
effort 
Quality early care and education services cost far more than any one funding source can cover It is 
imperative that providers are able to maximize all available funding in an attempt to cover the gap 
between revenue and expense This strategy includes drawing in the available funding sources and 
maximizing enrollment of children under the various sources First, an underutilized federal source that 
could be maximized, especially with the addition of provider supports to access the dollars, is the Child 
and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) This funding stream IS available to all child care providers serving 
low income children and reimburses providers for food expenses Providers may report that accessing 
this funding, and the associated reporting, IS an additional burden Portland's early care and education 
system is able to be a support infrastructure to enable providers to access this funding, as we know it 
can make a difference significant difference in the bottom line for providers

providers receive payment for the child care slots they have available inefficiency in enrollment impacts 
the amount of revenue a program brings in, in the case of every available funding source Typically, even 
when a provider IS under enrolled they are unlikely to be spending less on operations, as they cannot 
decrease teaching staff for two to three open slots Finding strategies to support providers in full 
enrollment, such as coordination across stakeholders on program openings, outreach and intake staff, 
centralized waiting lists, and addressing business practices to shorten the period that openings go 
unﬁlled, are all part a community response to increasing enrollment efficiency

Supporting good business practices Providers are further supported in full enrollment through 
community-based supports that focus on their overall business model These may include trainings and 
coaching on budgeting, fiscal operations, administration of public funding, and other child care specific 
topics Frequently these are offered as part of the state quality support system, Portland has the 
opportunity to assess whether these supports are sufficient in meeting the needs of Portland providers

and develop localized support to enhance as necessary For instance, localized supports may be able to 
reinforce specific business practices from the context of the experience of Portland providers how bad 
debt impacts the bottom line in Portland or budgeting with an understanding of actual cost data and the 
role a complete budget plays in planning for program operations Further, supporting good business 
practices also involves understanding when a provider may need a different model of supports 
Leveraging community networks, or hubs, to access back office supports, such as external accounting, 
billing services, payroll and human resources, may be the better solution for Portland providers Asa 
early care and education community, Portland needs a complement of strategies to support a strong 
business model, as one size does not fit all across the diverse needs of child care programs

EXAMPLE Shared servrce approaches may allow the Portland commu|nIty to achreve some of 
the cost beneﬁts that come wIth larger program s|ze and streamlme or strengthen orgamzatronal 
busmess practrces wIth staff dedrcated to these roles, shared by multrple sItes The shared servrce 
framework Involves centralIzed admmrstratron of many chrld care busrness operatrons across 
multrple famrly chIld care homes, classrooms or center These models have proven result' s In 
supportmg enrollment effrcrency and mInImIzIng bad debt, whwrle assumrng some of the burden of 
maxImIzIng fundmg streamshas they may also admrmster the federal chrld care food program to theI 
sItes Two examples of srtes usrng the shared-servIce framework for central admInIstratIon and 
shared busmess supports Include Sound Chrld Care Solutrons, a Seattle- based nonproﬁt that created 
a shared back offIce that supports nearly 30 classrooms In drverse nerghborhoods across the cIty and. 
offers hIgh qualrty care Chamblrss Center, a nonproﬁt In Chattanooga, uses a srmrlar framework to 
Sound Chrld Care Solutlons and Includes classrooms located at local publrc schools that are managed

commrtment to the Idea that programs should be rermbursed for the actual cost of qualrty early care 
and educatron servrces, and two, qualrty and qualrty Improvement Is a systemrc focus and goal that all 
programs are workmg on and the system IS buIlt to respond to qualrty needs of programs 
For the fIrst component, use revenue and expense model and analysrs from ECE ﬁscal analysrs to set 
base qualrty and fundmg amount and to understand the actual gap between cost of hrgh-qualrty sen/Ices

Another core consideration of understanding the cost of care is to understand the impact of sewing 
mixed age groups of children While a mixed delivery system may not inherently include ensuing a mix 
of ages of children are served by the different programs, analysis from the cost model demonstrates 
that programs do fare better when they serve children from birth through preschool, or birth through 
school age Movement of preschool programming to school based programs, from community based 
programs, has a detrimental impact on the ability of those community based programs to balance their 
operations

Strategles            
To address the second component, recognize that providers function at different points on the quality 
spectrum and the system needs to encompass supports to address these variances in capacity Leverage 
the quality improvement system (M RTQ) that already functions as a quality framework for programs 
Analysis of how the available quality supports are meeting current need will involve partnering with 
state partners around supports offered, uptake by Portland providers and input from Portland providers 
on how these supports increase and maintain their quality services This analysis may uncover places 
where local investment is needed to shore up the quality capacity building needed by Portland 
providers Leverage available state supports alongside the needs of Portland providers provides the 
foundation for developing a system-level quality support model Linking participation in this quality 
support system to the enhanced direct service funding model then support providers to trust in the 
connection between funding for quality services and their work to increase the quality of services 
As part of seeking to address the quality of care in an early care and education system, Portland leaders 
must focus on the reality that the current payment rates have had a direct impact on compensation 
Due to revenue that does not cover the cost of the program, even when that program includes low wage 
staff and little to no expenses for employee benefits, such as health insurance, paid time off or 
retirement supports, programs have been forced to attempt to balance their budgets on through the 
personnel lines Personnel makes up the largest proportion of any child care budget, typically between 
60-80% of the operating budget, therefore without sufficient revenue to cover costs, personnel 
expenses are kept far lower than is fair or equitable for their work, in order to ‘balance’ the budget 
Additionally, staff make accommodations (e g use of personal funds for materials, working nights and 
weekends, management staff working in classrooms to maintain coverage etc ) to maintain the work 
and attempt to meet family needs that are untenable, at best Child care providers face a disincentive to 
invest in quality because the current funding approach fails to compensate providers for the higher costs 
of operating at higher quality levels Not only does this approach impact the availability of quality early 
care and education opportunities for young children but it also places a heavy burden on the workforce 
In analyzing the current delivering of early care and education in Portland, an acknowledgment must be 
made that lower compensation does not necessarily mean lower quality programming, given the 
external market forces that have led to lower compensation 
Address the role of other community-based structures and system supports to maintain and 
strengthen the mixed delivery approach System supports share the goals of addressing specific 
prevention or intervention needs, increasing the training, education and capacity of providers, and the 
quality of the services delivered to children and families System supports emanate from many sectors 
including health, education, and social sen/ices and require coordination Aligning across existing 
system supports available to providers in the mixed delivery system and analyzing gaps in access to the 
available supports or gaps in types of supports available is an important next step in ensuring a 
comprehensive approach to mixed delivery system   

EXAMPLE Maintaining small programs (centers and FCCs) by having hub style support 
structures The needs of small programs, both centers and family child cares, are different than, 
programming ran by larger non proﬁt or school district entities Community, or service, hubs area 
way to offer supports needed by all early care and education programs, in a manner responsive to 
small programs For instance, a hub may house an outreach and intake coordinator that IS shared 
. across several programs, supporting the sites to stay fully enrolled by doing the work of maintaining 
a list of families seeking ECE programming and matching these families to available sites Another 
example of hub resources for programs meets the needs of quality supports in a way that small 
programs are unlikely to be able to secure or afford on their own mental health consultation 
Through a hub approach, the buying power of a birth to five trained mental health consultant is 
increased Each entity puts in resourcesfor the amount of mental health consultation their program 
needs and combined together, the hub may then be able to secure a part- or full-time mental health 
consultant to meet the participating program needs' 
Understand and respond to the impact of policy changes The cost model can be used to 
understand the fiscal impact on providers of many different policy or programmatic changes For 
example, the model includes several different salary options by default, including statewide and 
Portland specific data at both current salary levels and salary levels aligned with kindergarten salaries 
Users can run scenarios at each of these salary options to understand the impact of higher salaries on 
the cost of care The model also includes the ability to input a user-defined salary at any level which can 
be used to estimate the cost of specific policies related to salaries, including minimum wage ordinances 
or compensation initiatives With this data, policymakers can better understand the gap between what 
families can afford to pay, what provider can currently generate in revenue, and what it truly costs to 
provide high-quality child care with a well-compensated workforce Figures 11, 12 and 13 demonstrate 
the impact on cost from increased compensation at levels of the quality system, MRTQ This modeling is 
]LlS'lI one example of the different policy changes that can be costed in in the cost estimation tool

C Technical Manual 
The revenue and expense model developed for Portland is a tool to understand the cost of delivering 
early care and education services and to identify any gaps between this cost and the available revenues 
P5FS developed this excel-based model customized with data specific to Portland, ME The models 
output includes estimates of total revenues and expenses at the provider level and at the individual 
child level to fully explicate variations in expenses/revenues for different ages of children Expense data 
in the model is based on a combination of data collected from providers across Portland through 
individual inter\/iews and nationally validated default data from the federal Provider Cost of Quality 
Calculator (PCQC) Revenue data includes the revenue streams available to providers in Portland, 
including private tuition 
The model allows the user to modify various quality-related elements as well as select default qualrty 
levels aligned with Maine Roads to Quality standards 
Using the model 
Throughout the model, cells that can be changed by users are shaded yellow To model different 
program profiles, change the data entered in these cells either by using the drop down or typing over 
the yellow cell 
Variables 
Select settings for the key variables on with the [Variab|es|NPUT —CTR] tab or the [VariableslNPUT-FCC] 
tab Different settings can generate a very wide range of situations Each variable is explained below 
Quality Level The model includes default quality variables based on Maine Roads to Quality 
(MRTQ) step levels Users select the quality level to model in cell G1 
Size of Center/Enrollment In the center setting, size is represented as the number of 
classrooms by age range—infants (6 weeks to 1 year), toddlers (1 to 2 ‘/1 years), young 
preschoolers (2 V1 to 3 V1 years), preschoolers (3 to 5 years), state PreK (4 years) and school 
age (6 years+) Input the number of classrooms for each age group in Column G The 
number of children in each classroom IS determined by staff-to-child ratios and group-size 
data with variations based on quality level chosen In the FCC setting, input the number of 
children of each age served by the program, up to a maximum of 12 children 
Efficiency No program is 100% full 100% of the time To accurately capture the true 
revenue that programs receive to help cover their costs, the user can modify the percent of 
enrollment efficiency — which is how full the program is on average across the year, and the 
bad debt —which is how much of expected revenue is not collected Industry defaults are 
3% bad debt, and 85% enrollment efficiency 
Salaries Users can select from four default salary levels to use in the model Two categories 
use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) based on the following categories, with 
data either drawn statewide for Maine, or from the Portland metropolitan region1 
0 Director - 11-9031, Education Administrator 
0 Lead Teacher - 25-2011, Preschool Teachers, Except Special Ed

In addition, users can select salaries at a kindergarten parity level Under this scenario, lead 
teacher salaries are aligned with kindergarten parity, with the option to use either statewide 
data or Portland metropolitan area data Other salaries in this scenario are 8djUSl£ECl 
proportionally to the lead teacher salary at the same ratio as in the non-kindergarten parity 
scenario For kindergarten parity, the model uses BLS category 25—2012 
In the FCC model, a salary for the provider/owner is included at the level of a lead teacher in 
a center-based program While home-based providers may not pay themselves a salary, this 
ensures the model includes funds to support the owner as either a salary or business 
income 
Salary Override In addition to the four default salary categories, users can override these 
defaults and input a different salary Simply select ”User added" from the drop down and 
then input salaries at an hourly wage in the box to the right of the screen 
Benefits Users can select if the program offers discretionary health benefits, such as 
employer-paid health insurance, and can select the number ofsick and paid leave days 
offered to employees 
Revenue To accurately project revenues for your model program, enter the number of 
children at each age level who receive child care subsidy and state preK funds The private 
tuition column will automatically update with the balance of enrollment not covered by 
public funds Note that the table must be changed when the size of a program is changed 
Results — Cost per child 
The green table provides the cost per child results based on the user selected inputs Results are 
included on an annual, monthly and weekly basis for each age group The orange table shows the 
current child care subsidy or state PreK rates at the level of quality selected, and then the red tables 
calculate the monthly gap between the estimated cost per child, and the current subsidy or PreK 
rate 
Model Methodology 
The revenue and expense model relies on a detailed methodology that is based on the Provider Cost of 
Quality Calculator, but adjusted for the specific context of Portland, ME Details of this methodology are 
as follows 
Personnel Expenses 
The personnel section uses a standard staffing pattern typical of most centers, with the following 
assumptions built in 
0 Program Director (1 full time) 
0 Assistant Director (0 5 FTE if less than 30 children, 1 FTE if 31-100, 1 25 FTE if over 100 children 
enrolled) 
0 Administrative Assistant (0 5 FTE if less than 30 children, 1 FTE if 31-100, 1 25 FTE if over 100 
children enrolled)

personnel default, which can be updated in cell F12) 
The FCC-based program includes a provider/owner, with an assistant included at higher quality levels, 
when more infants are served, or when the program serves up to 12 children 
Wages 
Wages for each position are driven by the 0lu|a'l~ ‘iity ltevel‘ selected in the [Variables INPUT-CTR] tab or 
based on the user override The Floarlier/Assistalnt position is calculated based on an assistant teaicher 
wage Substitute expenses are caltuillaitedi based on» the number of sick days and paid time off the user 
input on the [Variables INPUT-CTR] tab Suib houlrly rates are based on an hourly rate that aligns with an 
assistant teacher 
Mandatory and Discretionary Benefits 
All federal and state mandatory benefits are contained in the model These include federal and state 
requirements, including unemployment insurance and workers compensation 
By default 10 days paid sick leave and 10 days paid leave is included for all staff 
If the discretionary beneﬁts option is selected on the input tab, the model includes $6,035 per FTE, 
which is the average annual employer contribution to health insurance, based on Kaiser Family 
Foundation data for Maine 2 
This figure is used as a proxy dollar amount which individual providers 
could choose to deploy in different walys, including health insurance contribution, retirement 
contribution or other discretionary benefits 
Annual training/professional development i-s also included at 30 hours per teaching staff member per 
year to meet licensing requirements 
Quality Variables 
Based on the quality levels chosen on the input tab, the model includes cost drivers related to 
Planning/Release Time and other factors related to meeting Maine Roads to Quality 
Nonpersonnel Expenses 
These expenses are aggregated into four categories 
1 Education Program for Children and Staff, which includes 
I Education/Program —Child Food/food related, classroom/child supplies, medical supplies, 
postage, advertising, field trips, family transportation, child assessment materials
