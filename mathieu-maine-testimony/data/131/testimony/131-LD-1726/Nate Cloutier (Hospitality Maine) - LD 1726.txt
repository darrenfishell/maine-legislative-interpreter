In Support of LD 1726, “An Act to Build Maine’s Economy by Supporting Child ,Care for Working Families ” 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of Committee on Labor and Housing My name 
is Nate Cloutier, and I am submitting comment on behalf of HospitalityMaine representing more than 1,200 restaurant 
and lodging establishments of all sizes across the state HospitalityMaine supports LD 1726, “An Act to Bu//0’/l//a/nes 
Economy by Supporting Ch//0’ Care for Working Fam///es” 
We are thankful to Senator Jackson for submitting this legislation that addresses the state's childcare and workforce 
crises This legislation proposes many changes that would be beneﬁcial to the childcare system, some of which we 
are especially supportive 
0 Doubling the monthly wage supplement for childcare providers to $400/month 
0 Increasing the childcare subsidy eligibility for families from 85% of state median household income to 125% 
0 Continuing the process of reimbursing childcare providers who accept subsidy based on enrollment, not 
/I attendance 
0 Developing a long-term plan for limiting childcare costs for families to no more than 7% of income for families 
earning up to 250% of the state median income beginning in 2030 
H0spitalityMaine has made childcare legislation a priority this session as we have seen the lack of affordable 
childcare impact our employees and businesses It lS important to look at childcare as a system with multiple 
components that all need to succeed in order for the system to succeed as a whole Childcare experts much smarter 
than I have termed these different components as three legs to a stool—accessibility, affordability, and quality From 
the perspective of the hospitality industiy, we have seen the difﬁculty employees have with paying for childcare, 
which is why we are in strong support of legislation in other committees that would incentivize employers ’ 
contribution to their employees ’ childcare However, that is only one component, families need to be able to afford 
childcare, yes, but there needs to be a strong and healthy childcare workforce in place so that employees can send 
their children to childcare in the ﬁrst place This bill will strengthen that workforce by offering more attractive wages 
and creating stability across the system’ 
The state needs to examine and research different funding formulas to see what a state contribution would look like 
for families to pay no more than 7% of the state median income by 2030 The numbers will be staggering and in the 
hundreds of millions, but we need to start somewhere as monthly stipends cannot be a permanent solution Finally, 
we would recommend that a representative of the business community be added to the list of representatives on the 
proposed Child Care Task Force 
We urge you to please vote LD 1726 ought to pass Thank you, and l would be happy to answer any questions
