Supporting Child Care and Working Families  
   
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services,  my name is Alexandra Turnbull , and I am the 
manager of Women United, a giving circle that is part of United Way of Southern Maine. I am 
here to testify on behalf  of Women United in support of LD 1726: An Act to Build Maine’s 
Economy by Supporting Child Care and Working Families.    
  
Women United is a group of community members who set out to support and lift up other 
women. With a focus on the advancement of single mothers and their children in Southern 
Maine, we use philanthropy, volunteerism, and advocacy to positively influence single mothers’ 
abilities to meet basic needs and find financial stability, secure high- quality education and care 
for children, and achieve optimal health and well -being.   
 
The child care crisis that our state is currently in undeniably affects most parents. However, data 
shows that it impacts mothers far more than fathers, and single mothers with disproportion. 
According to the most recent Maine Community Action Partnership (MECAP) statewide needs 
assessment, 21% of households in Maine are single- parent (compared to 14% nationally): 
single mothers represent a significant percentage  of the population .1 
  
Getting a child care spot has become nearly  impossible in Maine. “ Wait lists ” typically have 
hundreds of families seeking care and often require years of waiting. This is true for both Head 
Start and center -based care. When a family  finally gets a spot, they then must deal with the high 
turnover that is prevalent in the industry, which is extremely disruptive to children and relatedly impacts parents. Raising child care educator wages will show these vital professionals that they 
are valued by our society. Boosting pay will increase the ability of the individuals who work in 
child care to stay in their positions and thrive personally as well as professionally, which benefits 
the economy and families who use care. Offering paid child c are for workers’ children will make 
working in the industry actually feasible for single mothers and could drive young women into the workforce, which Maine needs.  
 
 
Affordability is a barrier. On average, the annual cost of center -based infant care in Mai ne is 
55% of the median income for a single mother. Combined with sky -rocketing housing and food 
prices how can we expect families to ever break the cycle of generational poverty? One of the 
biggest things we hear from single mothers in the programs we invest in is that they can never 
get ahead. They get caught in a cycle of needing resources (such as TANF or CCSP) and get a boost from having the resource, but then immediately lose the resource if they try to save 
money to become more permanently financially stable. Additionally, the dynamic of the middle -
class shrinking and poverty rates increasing leaves many lower -middle income families 
disqualified from resources such as CCSP but unable to afford necessary living expenses like child care. Expanding the eligibility for both childcare subsidies  and Head Start are logical

choices to combat this. Making both programs more accessible and faster to benefit from  are 
essential pieces of expanding their availability.    
  
Much of the above I have learned through the work of Women United, but I feel I would be 
remiss if I did not note my personal experience. I have two small children both in child care and 
all of the above rings true for my family. We waited almost two years to get into the child care 
center we are at now. We pay more than our mortgage for their care each month and regularly 
discuss if I should leave the workforce to care for our children: the cost of their care is so exorbitant, my employment isn’t all that lucrative. I’m fortunate to have a partner to share in 
these costs and give me more options, but some mothers aren’t.   
 
  
Many of the single mothers that Women United programming support came to their roles 
through untenable situations such as a partner passing away. These mothers need our state to 
support  them for their families to thrive. They deserve the opportunity to access high- quality, 
affordable child care, so they can engage in their community and support the local economy 
through employment, and so their children can build t he life -long foundation for success gained 
from participating in high- quality early education. Please support LD 1726: it can truly make a 
difference for Maine families.   
  
Thank you for your consideration and time,
