LD 1726
Hi, Thank you for your time and attention in this matter. I live in Northern Maine, 
however this wasn’t always the case we moved here from Augusta in 2020. Since 
living in Aroostook county it has been difficult to find childcare or after school care. 
I’m limited to one daycare. And my school age child, I find alternative daycare for. I 
was working in public school and had a calling to join the daycare as staff where  my 
youngest attends. While I have a college education and experience working with 
children in social services as well as education, I’m being compensated as an 
employee  who has no education or experience at all. I love working at the daycare  
and specifically their preschool program. I love that the program focuses on social 
emotional and academics. Im sad that I can no longer contribute to Maine Pers, I 
don’t make enough to contribute to my private Roth IRA, and Im now receiving state 
assistance. Im reliant on going to the food bank for myself and my children. As much 
as I love working at the daycare, it is not sustainable to live. I’ve spent the last 200$ 
bonus which is taxed, on trying to keep my car insurance active. As a parent I’ve seen
my child become attached to really amazing teachers who have to leave a profession 
they went to college for because the earnings are not live-able. And sadly this will 
become my fate, if nothing is turned around. 
Please take myself and my family into consideration when you are making decisions 
regarding the LD1726 AN ACT TO BUILD MAINE'S ECONOMY BY SUPPORT 
CHILD CARE FOR WORKING FAMILIES. We need to improve our infrastructure 
in childcare for families in Maine.
