I
am
very
appreciative
of
the
creation
of
the
wage
supplement.
The
wage
supplement
is
an
important
part
of
helping
Family
Child
Care
providers
and
has
helped
in
easing
an
immense
amount
of
stress
that
has
been
forced
upon
all
of
us
in
this
current
economic
state.
In
the
profession
of
Family
based
Child
Care
the
business
is
based
in
and
around
our
homes.
W e
as
Spouses,
Parents,
and
members
of
our
homes
do
not
leave
our
work
at
the
of fice
but
instead
carry
it
with
us
even
after
all
the
children
have
left
for
the
day .
The
climbing
costs
of
food,
electricity ,
and
various
other
everyday
expenses
has
become
more
of
a
burden
for
providers
as
the
wages
being
made
has
not
been
rising
alongside
those
costs.
Child
Care,
especially
Family
based
care,
is
not
a
business
in
which
providers
are
making
a
vast
amount
of
money .
Educators
are
a
part
of
this
community
because
of
their
love
for
children,
but
many
educators
are
being
lost
from
this
profession
because
of
the
instability
of
the
wages
that
are
needed
to
support
themselves.

The
Subsidy
program
is
incredibly
beneficial
to
families
in
this
unstable
time,
due
in
part
because
of
the
COVID-19
Pandemic.
These
social
programs
are
an
integral
part
of
keeping
families
afloat
during
these
trying
times.
With
that
being
said,
it
is
important
to
model
those
programs
after
the
needs
of
not
only
the
families
but
the
educators
that
are
accepting
these
programs
into
their
businesses.
The
Subsidy
program
is
attendance
based
payments
in
which
the
money
is
only
being
paid
towards
the
days
that
the
child
attends.
Most,
if
not
all
of
the
private
childcare
programs
such
as
Family
based
care
have
enrollment
based
tuition.
That
system
of
tuition
is
the
payments
are
based
on
the
spot
that
a
child
holds
at
the
program
and
attendance
does
not
play
a
factor .
This
is
an
important
distinction
because
when
a
business
decides
to
accept
a
child
that
is
a
part
of
the
subsidy
program
they
are
typically
already
taking
a
lower
amount
of
money
than
their
normal
tuition.
Attendance
based
tuition
can
be
costing
these
small
businesses
a
lot
of
money .
Family
Child
Care
programs
are
only
allowed
to
have
spots
for
12
children
during
the
day .
If
a
child
on
subsidy
is
absent,
even
for
the
span
of
one
day ,
that
is
a
large
amount
of
money
that
is
being
lost
because
subsidy
is
not
modeled
after
the
programs
that
are
accepting
it.
