LD 1726
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services: my name is Meghan Marcous, I 
am a resident of Auburn and I'm offering testimony in favor of LD 1726.
 
I’m a working single mom with two kids – Josiah, who’s 4, and Samarah, who’s 2. 
I know as well as anyone how hard it is to find childcare – and even if you can find it,
it’s so expensive. 
Right now I’m a student at Central Maine Community College – and making that 
work financially is tough. So I was surprised to learn that the average cost of child 
care if you send your kid to a childcare center is roughly the same as tuition at the 
University of Maine. 
I am super lucky to be able have childcare, especially as a single mom. If it weren’t 
for that I would not have the opportunity to work and go school. 
We all want our kids to have the best start – and to give them the opportunities later in
life that they deserve. Quality, affordable childcare is a vital part of making this 
happen. 
It gives our kids the care they need when they’re little, and makes it possible for 
parents like me to work – and in my case, go to school – to give our kids a better 
future.
Maine needs to invest in our child care system – it’s critical, for our families, our 
communities, and our economy. I hope you will support this bill. Thank you for your 
time.
