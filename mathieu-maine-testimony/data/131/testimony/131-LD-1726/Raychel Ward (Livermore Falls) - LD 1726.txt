ChIId Care and WorkIng FamIIIes 
I testIfIed In favor of makIng changes to MaIne's dependent tax credIt last week. 
We all know parents cannot sun/Ive on tax credIts and state beneﬁts alone nor 
would we want them too Our fIne state of MaIne has been a daycare dessert for 
as long as I can remember. As a parent to two specIaI needs gIrIs I needed to 
step out of the workforce I was prIced out due to the cost of chIId care and the 
poor chIId care quaIIty standards we ascrIbe to PassIng LD 1726 would pass on 
a morale boost to chlldcare workers beIng paId a llvable wage and that morale 
wIII be evIdenced by better quaIIty chIldcare and a slow down In attritIon In day
