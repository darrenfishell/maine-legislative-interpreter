Maine Community Action Partnership and the Maine Head Start 
Directors ’ Association Support LD 1726 An Act to Build Maine's 
Economy by Supporting Child Care and Working Families 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services, l am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the 
Maine Community Action Partnership and the Advocacy Director for the 
Maine Head Start Directors ’ Association, and we support LD 1726 An Act to 
Build Maine's Economy by Supporting Child Care and Working Families 
Our state's greatest resource is our people, and our state's policies shape 
people’s possibilities In Community Action, we create conditions that invite 
children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into the hidden 
potential in our communities Through our Whole Family approach, we build 
a family's capacity for sustained stability and economic growth We invest in 
the family's well-being, we let them dnve' their own stoiy, and we have 
tangible success 
At its very heart, early childhood education is the foundation of a child's 
future Proven programming like we have in Head Start is an inteniention to 
poverty later in life — for the children as the age and for the parents, who 
share in the supports Head Start provides Our classroom teachers, 
education technicians and nutntionists all take pnde in their work and their 
families, they love their work and do it out of that love 
Which is a good thing, because now, more than ever, they can work for 
more money, with less stress and certainty without cleaning up after 
rambunctious children every day at a nearby coffee shop, big box retailer or 
local shop This bill would help to rectify this situation in a few ways by 
doubling the current monthly wage supplement we are able to pay our 
educators, by professionalizing our dedicated and well educated work force 
- caring for and educating our children is a calling, certainly, and alsoa 
legitimate and necessary profession, and by strengthening our overall early 
childhood education system, meaning more children are school ready by 
ﬁrst grade 
The success of Maine's Head Start classrooms and Pre-K partnerships 
mean the success of Maine's families, communities and workforce LD 1726 
does this and more, and is part of the larger solution we are grasping with in 
Maine child and family well-being, reducing neglect and abuse, and 
strengthening and building strong systems for strong families 
l ask you to also carefully read the electronically submitted testimony of Sue 
Powers, my MeCAP colleague and long time early education expert, which 
is much more detailed in the affects these changes will have on early 
education in Maine 
Thank you for your time and attention
