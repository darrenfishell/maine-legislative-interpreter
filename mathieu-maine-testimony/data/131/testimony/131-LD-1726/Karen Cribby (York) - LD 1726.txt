Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Karen
Cribby.
I
am
the
owner
and
director
of
a
childcare 
center,
and
I
live
in
York.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy 
by
Supporting
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
I
support
raising
child
care
educator
wages
because
it
is
impossible
to
pay
a
high
wage
to 
childcare
workers
as
we
rely
on
parents
to
pay
us.
A
childcare
worker
who
is
excellent
with 
qualifications
should
be
paid
$20.00+
an
hour
but
that
means
parents
have
to
pay
more
for 
childcare
which
most
can
not
afford.
So
that
forced
women
mainly
to
give
up
there
profession 
until
their
children
are
in
public
schools
I
support
Maine
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it 
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
because
people
think
of
childcare
as
a
babysitting 
service.
It
is
a
profession
that
should
be
better
understood
including
educating
the
public
of 
state
guidelines
and
the
cost
to
meet
all
of
those.
If
we
break
down
the
cost
they
will
better 
understand
the
need
for
federal
and
state
assistance
to
run
a
childcare
center.
I
support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families.
I
have
a
family
at
my 
center
right
now
with
two
children
.
They
make
$90,000
between
the
two
of
them.
She
will
need 
to
give
up
her
teaching
position
because
they
can
not
afford
the
325
a
week
for
her
infant
and 
the
250
a
week
for
her
3
year
old
and
they
get
no
assistance.
We
have
to
do
better.
I
support
ensuring
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from
their 
program
because
when
children
are
absent
it
does
not
change
our
expenses.
We
still
have
to 
heat
the
building,
have
the
staff
there,
so
parents
still
pay
when
children
are
out
and
subsidy 
programs
should
do
the
same.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
long
term
plan
to
increase
investments
in
child
care
programs 
while
also
increasing
subsidy
eligibility.
I
have
a
toddler
room
I
can
not
staff
so
it’s
not
open.
If
I 
continue
to
lose
staff
to
Target
and
Walgreens
then
I
will
be
forced
to
shut
my
doors.
It
is 
extremely
difficult
to
keep
staff
as
they
have
to
take
CEUs
and
maintain
safety
courses
and 
CPR/Firstaid,
many
other
things.
They
get
paid
the
same
to
work
at
Target.
Why
would
they 
work
childcare
if
the
pay
is
the
same?
I
support
increasing
Head
Start
eligibility
and
funding
because
children
should
be
an 
investment.
They
are
the
future.
We
are
doing
a
terrible
job
raising
these
kids
and
mental 
health
issues
are
huge.
We
need
to
start
early
and
the
lower
income
families
need
more
help.
I
support
providing
funding
to
pay
for
child
care
for
child
care
employees
because
we
can
not 
compete
with
other
job
opportunities
that
are
less
stressful
with
less
requirements.
People
who 
work
in
childcare
generally
enjoy
children
and
many
are
mothers
who
could
not
afford
to
work 
unless
they
get
some
sort
of
discount
or
help
from
the
employer.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
because
if
it’s
too
long
a
wait
they
end
up
quitting
their
jobs
as
stress
to
wait
and
not
knowing
is
not
worth
it.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement.
It
should
be
weekly
submitted
in
my
opinion.
All
parents
pay
weekly
before
the
child
attends.
Waiting
two
weeks
after
the
child
has
come
is
burdening
the
employer
again.
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD

Karen
Cribby
