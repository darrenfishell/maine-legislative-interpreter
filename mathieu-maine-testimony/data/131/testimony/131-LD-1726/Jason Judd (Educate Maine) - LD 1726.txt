Senator Baldaccr, Representative Meyer, d|st|ngu|shed members of the Health and 
Human Servlces Commlttee, thank you for the opportunlty to testrfy today I am Jason 
Judd, Executrve D|rector of Educate Mame, a busmess-led educatlon advocacy 
organrzatlon I am here |n strong support of L D 1726 
Educate Mame’s m|ss|on IS to ensure that Mame people are prepared to succeed In 
educatlon and career and that all Mame people reach the|r hlghest educatlonal 
potentral lnvestmg |n accesslble, affordable early chlld educatlon |s cr|t|cal |f we are to 
glve every Mame chlld a strong start |n l|fe LD 1726 proposes meanmgful mvestments 
|n the early educatlon system ln Mame 
Educate Marne IS a foundrng partner of the Ma|neSpark coalrtlon, wh|ch IS workmg to 
support 60% of Mame people to achreve a degree or credentlal of value by 2025 The 
coal|t|on has deslgnated work groups and pollcy goals around Strong Foundatlons, 
focuslng on the populatlon blrth to age 6, because we recognrze the lmportance of 
|nvest|ng early for long-term academlc, career, and l|fe success Every dollar rnvested In 
early educatlon pays dlvldends down the road studles show that the return on 
mvestment |n early educatron programs produces somewhere between seven and 
eleven dollars for every dollar lnvested due to hlgher academlc achlevement, lmproved 
health, better economrc outcomes, and reduced crrme 1\ 
As a busmess-led organrzatlon, we hear from our employer partners regularly about the 
lmportance of early educatlon from a busmess standpolnt now and |nto the future 
Wlthout adequate chrld care, parents cannot partrclpate |n the workforce Employers 
across Mame |n all lndustnes are struggllng to attract and retarn employees because the 
ch|ld care s|tuat|on rs tenuous There slmply are not enough ch|ld care slots to meet the 
rmmense need For example 
o More than half (61%) of Portland Reglonal Chamber of Commerce busrnesses 
reported that thelr employees are havmg trouble f|nd|ng 'ch|ld care,

o 75% of busmesses c|te C|'ll|d care as the reason for unplanned absences, and 
o Nearly half of busmesses report that ch|ld care challenges as the reason that 
employees cannot return to work or return full-tlme 
Lack of chlld care,has become a dram on our economy and could produce up to $403 
m|ll|on more |n lost earnrngs, product|v|ty, and revenue for the state |f parents had 
relrable, affordable care for the|r young chrldren 2 A vote for this bill is not only a vote of 
support for Maine ’s children and families, it IS a meaningful investment in Maine's 
businesses and economic prosperity 
Educate Mame strongly supports the prov|s|ons lard out ln thrs b|ll We support 
expandrng the el|g|b|||ty for chrld care subsrdy, especially glven how cost-proh|b|t|ve 
ch|ld care can be for workmg famllles and provrders We encourage |ts emphasls on 
better data collectlon and analysts, cost modellng, workforce stlpends, and movlng 
toward a more comprehensrve system of care that better provldes for Ma|ne’s workmg 
famrlles and, by extenslon, |ts busmesses The Educatron and Cultural Aftarrs 
Commrttee unanlmously supported an Increase to the m|n|mum salary of Marne PK-12
