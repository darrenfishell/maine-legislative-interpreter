Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Erica
Skelton.
I
am
an
Owner/Director/Head
Preschool 
Teacher
,
and
I
live
in
Lisbon.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s 
Economy
by
Supporting
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
I
support
raising
child
care
educator
wages
because
average
salary
of
an
Early
childhood 
educator
is
about
$30k/year.
A
disproportionate
number
in
comparison
to
todays
cost
of
living. 
Yet
we’re
supposed
to
hire
and
maintain
a
staff
of
professionals
for
the
care
of
the
future
at
that 
rate.
It’s
impossible.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it 
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
because
with
understanding
comes
change,
positive 
change
for
our
field
is
beyond
needed.
We
are
the
workforce
supporting
the
workforce! 
Understand
our
cost!
I
support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families
because
the
cost
of 
childcare
should
not
be
the
burden
of
the
parent
alone,
we
are
a
community
and
if
we
operate 
as
such
we
will
be
able
to
not
only
survive
but
thrive.
Support
more
children
and
families.
I
support
ensuring
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from
their 
program
because
the
current
model
requires
the
provider
to
eat
the
cost
of
holding
a
slot
for
a 
child
on
the
subsidy
program.
Maintaining
that
open
position
prevents
the
program
for
receiving 
money
for
it.
Filling
it
prevents
a
subsidy
family
from
having
it.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
long
term
plan
to
increase
investments
in
child
care
programs 
while
also
increasing
subsidy
eligibility
because
Early
childhood
education
is
literally
our
future. 
We
are
talking
about
investing
in
the
future.
I
support
increasing
Head
Start
eligibility
and
funding
because
Head
start
is
a
wonderful 
program
that
needs
the
support
and
makes
giant
strides
in
the
field
of
education
I
support
providing
funding
to
pay
for
child
care
for
child
care
employees
because
it
should
not 
be
the
responsibility
of
the
program
to
eat
the
cost
in
order
to
be
staffed.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
because
providers
are
stuck 
with
eating
the
cost
if
they
enroll
the
student
while
waiting
to
find
out
if
a
family
was
approved
or 
not.
The
subsidy
does
not
backdate.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement 
wouldn’t
you
like
to
get
your
paycheck
faster
if
it
was
taking
forever?
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD
1726,
Erica
Skelton
