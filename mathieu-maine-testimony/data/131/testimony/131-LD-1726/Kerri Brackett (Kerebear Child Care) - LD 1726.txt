BILL LD 1726 
5/10/2023 
Augusta, Maine State House 
IN SUPPORT 
My name is Kerri Brackett, I am ﬁrst and foremost a parent but I am also the 
owner/director of Kerebear Child Care. I also am part of the leadership in ECE 
advocacy and policy group and a trainer for the Maine Roads to Quality I am 
testifying in favor of LD1726 
Have you ever wondered how you were going to support your family? How 
you were going to get a jOb if you cant ﬁnd child care? How you were going to ﬁnd 
child care at all? That IS the biggest struggle of young families today I ama 
mother and I cannot imagine the fear these families are facing. I have a family in 
my care right now that IS going through a domestic abuse situation She lost the 
second income and has to now ﬁgure out how she can provide care for her son 
and also keep a ]Ob I have supported her through the process of getting subsidy 
but the ﬁmeline on that can be months Technically, her child care bill IS now over 
$1000 behind Would yourjob wait months for you to ﬁgure out child care? This 
isn't the ﬁrst family I have supported through that process, nor will it be the last 
These young families are without options and struggling. LD1726 IS looking to not 
only move this process ﬁme up but also make it easier Some families are jUS1I over 
the income limits but st1ll unsure how they are going to afford child care on top of 
rent, a car, food, etc. This bill would also open many opportunities for our 
families that can jUSt barely afford care The cost modeling piece of this bill will 
take some of the stress of child care centers who are trying to keep tuition
affordable but also leave a realnstlc amount for the cost of provrdmg care The 
changes from one county to the next In the current model are not workmg I am 
worklng on a second center |n Stand|sh wh|ch |s Cumberland county and I can 
change more |n tumon based on the market rate than l can my Buxton s|te wh|ch 
IS only a few miles away ThlS |sn't workmg!
I 
Please help us support these stiaﬁ‘ and fam|l|es to make the quality ch|ld 
care that they are rece|v|ng affordable and the PayScale comparable to the rest of 
the teachers
