Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Lydia
Pillsbury.
I
am
a
social
worker,
and
I
live
in
Portland.
I’m 
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by
Supporting
Child
Care
and 
Working
Families.
Early
childcare
educators
play
an
incredibly
important
role
in
the
safe
and
healthy
development 
of
our
children.
These
early
years
can
set
a
child
on
a
course
of
safety,
security,
positive
growth, 
and
foster
a
love
of
learning.
Early
childhood
educators
are
underpaid
for
the
work
they
are 
doing
caring,
loving,
and
supporting
young
people.
I
support
raising
wages
to
reward
and
recruit 
strong
and
competent
educators
and
to
provide
livable
wages
to
those
working
in
this
field.
Data
matters.
The
state
would
benefit
from
a
cost
model
to
understand
the
finances
of
early 
childhood
education
across
the
state,
because
early
childhood
education
matters
and
data 
efficiency
matters
and
our
dollars
matter.
It
is
imperative
that
the
story
is
clear.
Better
policy
will 
be
made
with
better
data.
At
this
point,
access
to
high
quality
early
childcare
is
not
affordable
to
most.
I
support
raising
the 
subsidy
for
broader
eligibility
because
all
children
should
have
access
to
good
childcare.
Equity 
matters.
I
support
more
stable
funding
for
child
care
programs
because
stable
funding
=
stable 
programming.
Childcare
providers
should
not
be
punished
when
a
child
is
sick
or
a
family 
misses
school.
A
long
term
investment
in
Maine's
childcare
will
boost
the
health
and
well
being
of
all
Mainers. 
To
do
that
we
need
greater
investments,
including
an
increase
to
the
subsidy
eligibility.
Head
Start
is
a
strong
childcare
program
and
should
receive
more
funding
to
increase
access 
across
the
state.
I
support
providing
funding
to
pay
for
childcare
for
childcare
employees
so
that
these
educators 
can
work
in
this
field,
continue
to
develop
and
grow
as
professionals,
and
afford
to
have
their 
children
receiving
the
services
they
provide
to
others.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
and
shortened
time
periods 
for
childcare
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement
because
this
is
an
urgent
matter
and 
bureaucracy
hurts
children.
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD
1726,
Lydia
Pillsbury
