Ma1ne’s chrldcare CI'lSlS needs attent1on now From Klttery to Canbou our state’s early chlldhood 
educatlon programs are strugglmg 
My name rs Jennlfer Mlchaud and I am a chlldcare buslness owner 1n the state of Mame I serve 
as a board member of Ma1neAEYC (Assocratlon of Young Chlldren), I am an act1ve partlcrpate 
1n my hometown communltres Heart and Soul 1n1t1at1ve and downtown rev1tal1zat1on plan I am 
also a member of Fnends of Downtown Sanford (subsldy of Strategles for a Stronger Sanford) 
My hope today 1s to share a p6I‘Sp€ClI1V€ as a busrness owner as well as represent my team of 
amazrngly dedrcated early chlldhood educators 
As bus1ness owner of Krds Kove Ch1ldcare and Learnmg Center 1n Sanford and Spnngvale, I take 
great pnde 1n my personal Journey I have paved 1n the ECE ﬁeld 1n our State over the last 15 
years To date, I have provlded chlldcare and early leamlng expenences for approxlmately 500 
chrldren 1n and around the Sanford and Spnngvale communrty 
In 2007 I started my career 1n early chrldhood educatron as an 1n home early chrldhood 
educator I started by prov1d1ng care for 6 chrldren In 2018, an opportunrty was presented to 
lease a commerc1al space 1n the heart of downpwn Sanford Knowlng I had over 20 famrlres on 
the wa1tl1st to get mto my home chrldcare program, I felt compelled to serze the busrness 
opportumty On October 12, 2018 I closed my 1n home famlly chrldcare program of 12 chlldren 
Just two days later my husband and I opened a chtldcare center 1n the heart of the Sanford 
downtown area Four short months later word got around town and I asked for an rncrease 1n 
ch1ldcare capacrty to meet more of the chlldcare needs 1n my commumty I 1ncreased my hcense 
to care for 65 fam1l1es and garnfully employed a total of 12 full trme early clnldhood educators 
Thrs all happened 1n a qulck snap of 6 months! Fast forward to 2021 when I notlced that a small 
chrldcare fac1l1ty nght down the road from mme was looklng to sell From 2018-2021 my 
chlldcare busmess grew from 12 ch1ldren to 120 chlldren From one employee to 20 employees 
To date, our chrldcare programs have 78 fam1l1es on our wa1tl1st To add, we turn away on 
average 2-3 fam1l1es a week Ch1ldcare1s 1n a CTISIS because we cannot open enough spots to 
care for the amount of chrldren who need us Famrlres who need us 
In order to prov1de care for more chrldren we need to drscuss the cr1s1s surroundmg employee 
recru1tment and retent1on
