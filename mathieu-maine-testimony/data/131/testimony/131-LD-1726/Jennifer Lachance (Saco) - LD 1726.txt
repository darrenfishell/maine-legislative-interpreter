Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Jennifer
lachance.
I
am
a
daycare
Owner
and
provider,
and
I 
live
in
Saco.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by
Supporting 
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
I
support
raising
childcare
worker
wages
because
I
think
that
everything
around
us
is
going
up 
and
so
shouldn’t
our
pay.
us
daycare
providers
have
been
underpaid
as
long
as
I’ve
been
doing 
it
for
about
25
years.
We
take
care
of
peoples
precious
kids
and
don’t
even
make
minimum 
wage
and
get
paid
underpaid.
You
could
become
a
nanny
or
a
babysitter,
and
make
more.
And 
we
have
to
do
all
this
trainings,
paperwork,
clean
food,
shop,
and
so
much
more.
and
if
you
get 
subsidy,
they
go
below
what
we
ask
for
Catholic
Charities
should
be
all
everybody
at
a
level
one 
instead
of
tier
twos
in
tier
ones
because
they
don’t
give
a
lot
out
either.
And
I
just
feel
as
they 
can’t
provide
is
always
get
the
short
end
of
the
stick,
but
if
it
wasn’t
for
us,
parents
wouldn’t
be 
able
to
go
to
work
I
support
Maine
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it 
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
because
I
think
there
should
be
more
tools
more 
education
to
help
us
take
care
providers
and
I
think
we
should
also
have
some
say
with
how 
difficult
long
days
not
just
five
days
a
week
we’re
doing
stuff
on
weekends
and
I
think
that
would 
help
us
out.
I
  support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families
because
I
feel
subsidy
is 
always
been
lower
than
even
our
daycare
rates
and
we’re
not
even
getting
paid
what
we
should 
and
most
people
do
you
get
subs
today
so
that
puts
us
and
working
long
days
working
hard 
days
not
getting
what
we
need
for
money
and
most
people
won’t
take
subs
today
for
that
reason 
and
those
families
won’t
be
able
to
work
if
that’s
the
case
Whoever
is
in
charge
of
that
needs
to 
think
of
us
as
providers
that
we
have
bills
we
have
our
families
we
have
things
that
we
need
for 
daycare
and
we’re
working
longer
hours
than
most
people
that
work
eight
or
nine
hours
a
day. 
So
I
think
your
families
can’t
afford
it
they
pay
their
parent
fee,
whatever
but
then
the
state 
needs
to
cover
the
rest
to
make
it
fair
for
us
providers
to
be
able
to
survive
our
business.
And
I 
also
think
substudy
should
follow
what
everyone
has
in
their
contract.
If
a
child
is
absent,
the 
state
should
pay
if
we
have
vacations,
the
state
should
pay
if
we
have
holidays,
the
state
should 
pay.
What
people
need
to
understand
is
we
don’t
charge
for
children
of
attendance.
We
charge 
children
to
hold
their
spot
so
if
they’re
out
we
can’t
fill
that
spot
to
put
another
child
in
here
and
I 
feel
they
should
go
buy
a
contract
and
it
should
be
five
days
a
week
paid
no
question
just
not 
fair
like
I
said
we
get
paid
for
their
spot
not
attendance.
I
just
think
that
if
a
child
comes
to 
daycare
that
we
should
get
paid
what’s
in
our
contract
and
not
just
what
the
state
wants 
because
it’s
definitely
below
all
of
our
contract
payments
that
we
ask
for
parents.
And
if 
investments
means
to
up
the
subsidy,
I
am
definitely
for
that.
What
people
don’t
realize
either 
some
kids
are
easy
some
kids
are
hard
we
deal
with
these
kids
for
about
at
least
9
to
10
hours 
a
day
and
if
you
looked
at
nannying
or
babysitters
and
see
how
much
they
would
get
for
a
day. 
We
are
definitely
underpaid
with
bills
and
stuff
that
are
needed
for
daycare.
So
we
definitely
are 
not
doing
this
for
the
money.
We
are
doing
this
for
the
kids
and
so
families
can
work
but
I
would 
think
it
would
be
fair
to
give
us
what
we
deserve
because
it’s
definitely
not
an
easy
job.
I
support
providing
funding
to
pay
for
child
care
for
child
care
employees.
I
don’t
have 
employees,
but
from
hearing
from
other
providers,
they
are
not
able
to
keep
their
help
because 
they’re
going
other
places
for
higher
pay,
which
leads
to
people
at
closing
daycare
or
having
to 
lower
their
numbers
because
they
can’t
get
help,
and
again
we
take
care
of
peoples
precious 
kids.
It’s
a
lot
of
work
and
if
people
are
not
getting
by,
they
will
go
elsewhere.
And
now
with
the 
stars
being
out
it’s
going
to
make
it
10
times
harder
for
all
those
people
because
if
they’re
not 
qualified,
their
stars
are
going
to
be
down
to
one
or
two
and
if
most
people
look
at
stars
like 
everybody
does,
everybody
looks
for
a
five-star
hotel
five
star
restaurant
they
feel
that
that’s 
going
to
be
the
same
for
us
providers
and
it’s
pretty
sad
because
by
STARZ
doesn’t
show
the 
care
and
everything
that
we
do
for
our
families
and
that’s
gonna
hurt
as
well.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
because
if
shorten
time 
means
that
when
people
are
up
for
their
eligibility
that
it
should
be
done
in
a
faster,
timely 
manner
because
we’ve
been
putting
situations
where
their
case
has
been
closed
and
then
it 
leads
them
to
have
to
pay
until
subsidy
can
pick
up
again,
and
it
causes
a
big
interruption
with 
all
of
that
and
it
makes
it
harder
on
us
so
they
need
to
figure
out
a
way
to
have
parents
get
their 
stuff
in
either
sooner
so
they
can
see
what
is
needed,
etc.
or
figure
out
some
thing
that
works
so 
us
providers
and
not
the
ones
that
are
suffering
because
we’re
not
getting
paid
for
that
child 
because
they’ve
gone
over
their
time
limit
of
the
application
or
if
somebody
on
the
other
end 
isn’t
checking
yet
fast
enough
it’s
leading
them
to
go
over
their
expiration
date
so
something 
definitely
needs
to
be
done
about
that.
I
support
shortening
time
periods
for
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement 
because
I
think
that
if
people
are
eligible
for
subsidy,
it
should
start
right
away
and
it
also
is
a 
hard
thing
to
and
it’s
happened
to
me
that
I’ve
sent
billing
in
and
then
in
two
weeks
have
not 
received
a
check
and
has
called
and
said
that
I’ve
sent
my
billing
in
on
time
and
then
I
still
have 
to
wait
two
more
weeks
to
get
paid
even
if
it’s
not
our
fault
two
weeks
is
a
long
time
when 
people
got
bills
coming
in
and
if
it’s
on
somebody
else’s
end
and
not
as
providers
and
why
do 
we
get
punished
of
not
getting
paid
for
another
two
weeks
when
the
billing
goes
out
for
payment 
that’s
for
weeks
and
some
of
us
have
bills
that
need
to
be
put
in
on
time,
and
if
we
don’t
have 
that
money,
how
do
we
pay
for
bills.
