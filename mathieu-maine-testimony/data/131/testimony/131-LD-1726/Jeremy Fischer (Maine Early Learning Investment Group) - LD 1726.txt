Good mornlng Cha1rpersons Baldaccr and Meyer, and members of the Health and Human 
Servlces Commlttee 
My name 1s Jeremy Flscher I’m a former member of the House, where I represented 
Presque Isle for three terms Dunng my t1me 1n the Leglslature, I served on the Educatron 
Commlttee and chalred the Approprratrons Cormmttee, where I worked to expand access to Head 
Start Smce leavrng the Leglslature, I’ve been very mvolved 1n the 1ssue of early care and 
educat1on I currently serve on (1) the Govemor’s Ch1ldren ’s Cab1net’s Early Chlldhood Advlsory 
Counsel, (2) EducateMa1ne ’s Early Leammg Advrsory Commrttee, (3) Educare Central Ma1ne’s 
board of dlrectors, and (4) my local school board, where I helped start a publ1c pre-K program last 
year I’m also the father of three sons, ages 10, 8, and4 
I’m here today, however, to testlfy on as a board member of the Mame Early Leammg 
Investment Group We’re a group of busrness leaders from all corners of the state who understand 
the economrc lmpact of the comprehensrve and hrgh qual1ty early care and educatlon servrces 
Overwhelmlng, the ev1dence shows that quahty early care prepares k1ds to succeed 1n 
school and 1n therr 11ves There are stacks of research papers that vahdate the rmportant role that 
1t plays 1n our educatron system Gettrng the ﬁrst 5 years of l1fe off to an educatronally sound start 
1s a II13._]O1 ‘ predrctor of the contrlbutlon each and every one of our youngest Marne c1t1zens w11l 
make when they become adults 
From the buslness commun1ty ’s perspectlve, ehrld care 1s one of the most fundamental 
components of our business infrastructure. Busrnesses can’t expand wrthout workforce, and 
parents can’t be part of the workforce unless therr chrldren are cared for In Mame, 69% of chrldren 
under the age of 6 have all avarlable parents 1n the workforce Th1s means that there are more 
50,000 chlldren under 6 1n Mame who need ch11d care 
Addressrng th1s problem requ1res a coordrnated and sustarned approach to support chlldren, 
famrlres, and the early educators That’s exactly what LD 1726 does It’s a comprehensrve brll 
that focuses on the three most lmportant factors for expandmg access to quahty early care and 
educatlon 1s every corner of our state — access, affordabllrty and quahty It accomplrshes th1s goal 
by 1ncreas1ng wages for ch1ld care workers, expandlng el1g1b1l1ty for ch1ld“ care subs1d1es, and 
lIIlpI‘OVll'lg the quahty of care 
For these reasons, the Ma1ne Early Leammg Investment Group urges you to support LD 
1726 I am happy to answer any questrons that you may have
