Testimony of Rhonda Kaiser 
In support of 
LD 1726 An Act to Build Maine's Economy by Supporting Child Care and Working Families 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee My name is Rhonda Kaiser and l am the Director at Educare Central 
Maine, an early childhood school that provides high-quality care and education for infants, 
toddlers and preschoolers l’m testifying iri support of LD 1726 An Act to Build Maine's Economy 
by Supporting Chtld Care and Working Families 
What could be more vital to Maine communities than how we care for our children and families ‘? 
Long before the pandemic, child care issues were a major challenge for businesses Today, 
more than ever, we face billions of dollars in economic productivity and revenue losses due to 
the lack of accessible, stable, reliable and affordable child care options 
Federal Poverty thresholds do not account for living costs beyond a very basic food budget The 
federal poverty measure does not take into consideration costs like childcare and health care 
that not only draw from one’s income, but also are determining factors in one's ability to work 
and to endure the potential hardships associated with balancing employment and other aspects 
of everyday life. 
Let’s look at the math 
1 For single parents- to qualify for sen/ices under the current Federal Poverty LevelA 
single parent of one child, working full-time and eaming minimum wage (equates to 
$28,704 annually) does NOT qualify for Head Start (the maximum federal poverty level 
is $19,718 annually) Raising State Head Start eligibility to 185% of Federal Poverty 
Level (this would allow a single parent to make $17 53 per hour) would help working 
single parents access comprehensive Head Start sen/ices for their child/ren 
2 For two parents working full-time, with two children, the combined hourly wage cannot 
be greater than $14 43 per hour (which is $7 22 per hour per working parent), or 
$30,000 annually, to qualify for services guided by the Federal Poverty Level guidelines 
By raising state eligibility for Head Start to 185% of Federal Poverty Level each parent 
could earn up to $13 34 per hour (still under minimum wage) 
Children and families stand to benefit tremendously from Head Start and child care—but only if 
they can access it in their community increasing eligibility for enrollment in Head Start to 185% 
of the federal poverty level and increasing eligibility for child care subsidies from 85% of the 
State's median income to 125% of the state's median income would allow more families to stay 
in or enter the workforcel 
Raising child care subsidy and Head Stait eligibility will help parents access care but how do we 
assure we have the qualiﬁed early childhood workforce to care for our ChliClI'8l'l'7 We won’t do it 
by paying them $17/hour The average annual salary for an early childhood teacher in Maine is 
approximately $35,000 Since research has proven that 85% of a child's core brain structure is 
formed by age five (which means that a child's experiences during the ﬁrst five years of life can 
greatly impact the brain's ability to develop) why wouldn’t we invest in those individuals that play 
such an enormous role in our children's future success’? Early childhood educators are 
essential Funding that covers the cost of care, which includes fair compensation for the skilled, 
valuable, and essential work of our early childhood educators is necessary Raising early 
childhood educator wages translates into more individuals enter the workforce to care for our 
children resulting in an increase of billions of dollars in economic productivity and revenue gains 
If parents and caregivers can't get child care they can't go to work It's time to treat child care 
like what it is as essential to economic growth as infrastructure or energy
