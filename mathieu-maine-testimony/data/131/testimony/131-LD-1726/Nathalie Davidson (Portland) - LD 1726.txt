LD 1726
Dear Representatives. 
My name is Nathalie Davidson and I live in Portland, Maine. I am a parent with 2 
children in daycare. Currently 25-30% or our salary goes to childcare costs. I am a 
nurse and my husband is a teacher. This has put a large financial burden on our 
family. It is my hopes that you consider supporting Troy Jackson's bill, LD 1726, 
which supports Maine's system of child care by advancing compensation for 
educators and creating affordability for families.
Thank you, 
Nathalie Davidson
