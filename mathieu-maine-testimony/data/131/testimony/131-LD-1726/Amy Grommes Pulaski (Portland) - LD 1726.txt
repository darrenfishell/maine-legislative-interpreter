LD 1726
Please support LD 1726. Childcare is an essential component of our functioning 
society. It is needed for businesses, employees, school districts, local governments, 
fishermen, trade workers, healthcare, and more. Every industry depends upon 
childcare in order to go to work. Childcare is an essential component in our society, 
and right now there is not enough childcare, and childcare workers are not earning a 
living wage. Please support LD 1726 in support of childcare for working families. 
Thank you.
