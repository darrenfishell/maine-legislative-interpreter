Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Susan
Tripp.
I
am
an
In-Home
After
School
Care
Provider, 
and
I
live
in
Ellsworth.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by 
Supporting
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
As
a
provider
for
over
35
years,
any
and
all
supplemental
income
support
is
a
help
and
allows 
me
to
focus
on
helping
families
and
the
children
in
my
care,
which
is
why
I
support
raising
child 
care
educator
wages.
I
feel
appreciated.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it 
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
because
information
is
power
and
provides
problem 
solving
opportunities.
I
support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families
because
parents
work
hard. 
Trying
to
make
everything
work
when
inflation
is
so
high
is
very
difficult.
Kids
and
families
suffer.
I
support
ensuring
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from
their 
program
because
it's
a
trust
relationship.
Families
need
to
trust
the
provider
will
care
for
their 
children,
while
the
provider
must
trust
the
families
to
pay
for
that
slot,
regardless
of
attendance.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
long
term
plan
to
increase
investments
in
child
care
programs 
while
also
increasing
subsidy
eligibility
because
as
an
industry,
it
is
in
crisis.
Families
need
child 
care.
Children
need
a
safe
and
caring
place
to
grow.
Providers
need
less
regulatory
demands 
that
have
ruined
what
was
once
a
great
cottage
industry.
Young
mothers
used
to
stay
home
with 
their
young
ones
and
be
able
to
care
for
other
kids,
legally,
licensed,
etc.,
Now
they
have
so 
many
regulations,
it
discourages
people
to
offer
their
community
some
home
based
care.
All 
care
doesn't
need
to
be
the
same,
program
to
program.
Parents
can
decide
their
children's
care 
whether
it
is
a
less
regulated
more
casual
program
or
a
regimented
center
based
program 
dealing
with
large
numbers
of
children
and
multiple
employees.
A
simple
home-based
business 
has
been
driven
out
of
existence
by
over
regulation.
This
problem
was
avoidable,
and
should
be 
rectified.
I
support
increasing
Head
Start
eligibility
and
funding
because
early
intervention
is
a
proven 
advantage
with
all
children,
affluent
or
not.
I
support
providing
funding
to
pay
for
child
care
for
child
care
employees
because
the
need
for 
child
care
is
universal
and
the
need
for
child
care
workers
is
now
in
crisis.
Improved
wages
and 
support
can
only
help
the
situation.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
because
who
doesn't
want 
better
efficiency,
anywhere
with
everything?!!
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement 
because
I
stopped
offering
subsidized
care
20
years
ago
because
working
with
the
state
was
a 
nightmare.
I
can't
see
where
it
has
improved
in
that
time.
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD
1726, 
Susan
Tripp
