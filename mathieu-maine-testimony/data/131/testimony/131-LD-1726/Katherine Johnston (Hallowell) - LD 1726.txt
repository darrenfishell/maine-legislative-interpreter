TestImony from KatherIne Johnston, ResIdent, Hallowell, ME 
In Support Of 
L D 1726 "An Act to BuIld MaIne's Economy by Supportlng ChI|d Care for WorkIng FamIlIes" 
Wednesday, May 10, 2023 
Senator BaldaccI, Representatlve Meyer, dIstInguIshed members of the Health and Human 
ServIces Comm|ttee, my name Is KatherIne Johnston and I am the parent of two young 
daughters, Margot, age 3, and Norah, 7 months My famIly lIves In Hallowell 
I am here to test|fy In strong support of LD 1726, both as a parent and as someone who has 
worked In early chIldhood polIcy and knows deeply how crItIcal these Investments are In our 
cItIzens, now and Into the future 
As many of you know, beIng a parent Is hard Really hard It Is also the most rewardIng thIngI 
have ever done, but the choIce to have chIldren has come at a tremendous cost and Immense 
stress daIly In MaIne today, the shortage of qualIty — or, frankly, ANY chIld care — IS acute 
Before my ﬁrst daughter was born In 2019, my husband and I called 37 - THIRTY-SEVENI — 
chIldcare provIders In order to fInd a slot for our baby 37 IS also the exact number of mIles thIs 
center was from our house We took the slot 
The chIldcare sItuatIon Is even worse In 2023 I left my full-tIme jOb workIng on chIldcare In the 
Governor's OffIce In January because — In a feat of Irony — we could not fInd chIldcare for our 
second baby I've spoken wIth chIld care center dIrectors at length about what It would take for 
theIr supply of chIId care to come even a small amount closer to meetIng the overwhelmIng 
demand TheIr answer Is the same every tIme workforce 
I had a heartbreakIng conversatIon wIth a center dIrector who has been a champIon for hIgh- 
qualIty care In the communIty She raIsed money to expand her center and had to scale back 
proposed offerIngs, cuttIng two rooms for young chIldren out of the expansIon plans because of 
the uncertalnty of the pandemIc, and she calls thIs mIsfortune a ”sIlver lInIng" from the 
busIness perspectIve because fIndIng chIldcare workers to staff exIstIng classrooms has been 
next to ImpossIble The work Is challengIng, underpaId, and unable to be further subsIdIzed by 
parent tuItIon, whIch IS already crIpplIng Parents are In a bInd that IS hard to ImagIne If you 
haven't had chIldren wIthIn the past ten years or so Wages may not or may only just barely 
cover the cost of care, whIch IS about $1,000/mo per chIld on average, not enough to pay 
chIldcare educators the wages they deserve and yet fInancIally terrIfyIng for famIlIes who are 
spendIng well over theIr mortgages each month for the prIvIlege of beIng able to work 
ThIs Is one of the bIggest Issues facmg our state today and thIs bIll Is ﬁrst step at tryIng to tackle 
thIs daIly mghtmare for parents and communItIes The bIll provIdes for absolutely necessary
salary stnpends to attract and retam a cr|t|cal chlld care workforce It |nvests In bu|ld|ng a system 
that at least begms to acknowledge the real cost of prov|d|ng care It pl"OVld8S for cr|t|cal data 
COHGCUOH that |s necessary to create stronger pol|c|es and supports for parents and provlders It 
demonstrates a comm|tment to supportmg fam|l|es when the|r needs for care are the hlghest, 
when the mvestments |n chnldren pay off the most, and when parents are least able to be able 
to fund and pay for care that IS necessary for us to work The mvestment alone |n gettlng 
parents back |nto the workforce to power our economy w|ll be Immense It IS heartbreak|ng to 
see how many parents across Mame are screammg |nto Facebook groups trymg to ﬁnd any care 
for the|r chlldren so they can go to work It |s a thoroughly broken market and the only path 
forward |s w|th pub||c mvestment 
I often wonder how we got to th|s place, where both parents have to work to make ends meet 
|n th|s economnc clnmate and yet |t's the earl|est years when our chlldren need the most hands- 
on care, when their bra|n\s are growmg the most, and soc|ety says, ”we'll help you out when 
they turn 5 " Th|s keeps me up at mght more than my baby I urge you to pass LD 1726 Thank 
you for your t|me
