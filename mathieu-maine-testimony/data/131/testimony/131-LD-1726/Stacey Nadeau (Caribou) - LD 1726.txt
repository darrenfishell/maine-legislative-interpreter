LD 1726
I am submitting my written testimony in support of LD 1726. I have been personally 
impacted by the childcare crisis that continues to get more urgent by the day. My 
children attend a childcare facility that sometimes has to close due to lack of staffing. 
People get sick and it is understandable this happens, but it is still a strain on parents. 
When this happens, I have to call out of my work to stay home with them if I cannot 
find alternate childcare for that day. Childcare facilities are struggling. There aren't 
enough providers because it has become a financial burden to provide childcare. 
Childcare is a financial hardship for families as well. Yet childcare is necessary for 
parents to work and provide for their families and to provide necessary services to our
communities. There are other times when there is a notice that the childcare facility 
has exactly enough staff for the day, but if any staff needs to go home during the day, 
they will have to close. That means I would have to leave work and my children 
would need to be picked up at any moment. It's a stressful feeling and difficult 
situation for everyone, for parents and daycare providers, who are working as hard as 
we can to take care of our children, who are Maine's future.
