Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Michele
Plazeski.
I
am
a
toddler
teacher,
and
I
live
in
Portland. 
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by
Supporting
Child
Care 
and
Working
Families.
Without
an
increase
in
wages
for
child
care
workers,
we
will
continue
to
see
exactly
what
we
are 
seeing
now.
Childcare
centers
closing,
staff
shortages
and
long
wait
lists
for
the
limited
space 
available
for
Maine's
families.
Limited
availability
means
families
may
have
to
make
difficult 
decisions
that
can
have
lasting
impacts
on
both
the
family
and
the
local
economy.
Childcare
and 
working
parents
go
hand
in
hand.
Without
either,
what
does
that
mean??
In
my
mind
something 
that
is
frightening
to
everyones
future!
Parents
may
be
forced
to
place
their
children
in
care
that 
is
NOT
desirable
in
order
for
them
to
continue
to
work
so
that
they
can
pay
living
expenses. 
With
that
being
said,
childcare
workers
like
myself
CANNOT
afford
to
pay
for
living
expenses
for 
themselves.
I
am
a
51
year
old
single
parent.
I
DO
NOT
earn
enough
money
to
pay
my
bills.
I 
work
full
time
in
a
toddler
program
40
hours
a
week.
I
also
HAVE
to
work
2
other
jobs
on
top
of 
being
a
single
parent
to
a
teen
age
girl
that
lives
with
me
full
time.
Phew,
when
do
i
breathe?!!! 
How
do
I
manage?
I
have
learned
how
to
work
myself
to
the
bone.
Working
with
children
is
a 
demanding
job
both
physically
and
emotionally.
You
have
to
be
present
with
children,
engaging 
and
respectful.
It
also
requires
patience
and
compassion.
Why
is
it
that
OUR
society
does
not 
view
early
childhood
as
a
crucial
time
in
a
child's
life.
Science
says,
brain
development
that 
takes
place
in
the
first
3
years
of
life,
is
the
most
rapid
development
that
will
take
place.
Neural 
pathways
are
making
their
connections
with
the
help
of
well
paid,
college
educated
teachers. 
What
happens
if
you
don't
have
childcare
teachers
that
understand
this
and
place
value
on
their 
role
in
a
young
child's
life?
Hmmmmm.......again
that
is
also
frightening!
We
place
more
money 
in
our
prison
systems
than
we
do
into
starting
our
children
off
with
a
healthy
foundation
in
quality 
childcare
centers!
This
will
only
happen
when
we
start
paying
a
livable
wage
that
is
inclusive
for 
ALL
to
feel
they
are
able
to
"choose"
to
work
in
childcare.
It
should
be
looked
at
as
a
"privilege 
and
a
gift"
to
have
the
opportunity
to
work
with
such
an
exceptional
population.
Please
vote

support

Plazeski
