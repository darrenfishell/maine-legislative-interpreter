In support of

Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, my name is April Tardiff and l am a Mother of a 17month old, a wife,a 
Maine Parent Ambassador, and a fonrier Childcare worker. I'm testifying in support of LD 1726 
An Act to Build Maine’s Economy by Supporting Child Care and Working Families 
Ibecame a mother in Dec 2021 and was forced to resign from my high paying corporate jOb 
because full time childcare was hard to ﬁnd Alter being forced from my full-time position, 
I decided to help the childcare workforce by becoming a childcare worker I felt so 
excited that this new position was going to educate me more on all the developmental 
milestones and education for my child to grow To become a “teacher in a daycare” I had 
to take a $8 pay cut and then also pay for my child to still come with me Within a few 
weeks I would ﬁnd out that this new exciting ]Ob was not in the best interest for my 
family I felt severely under paid, I was putting in little over 40hr weeks and I would come 
home with less than $75 dollars after paying for my son to be there 
I was under trained, they moved me into my own class of 7 one-year olds all by myself 2 days 
into working Coming from a warehouse supen/isor position There was never enough 
staff to get our whole lunch break most days they would cut it the 30mins in half I felt no 
support from senior stafli and everyone that had been there for anytime explained how 
most days are just sun/ival Needless to say that after 4weeks of employment I Ieﬁ the 
daycare. I was to stressed and the $75 a week jUSt seemed senseless to remain there 
any longer lknow that I would still be working with children had I been compensated 
correctly and felt more support from supervisors
