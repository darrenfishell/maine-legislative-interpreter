Testimony of Kasey McBlais 
309 Bryant Rd Buckfield, ME 04220 
In support of 
LD 1726 An Act to Build Maine's Economy by Supporting Child Care and Working Families 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, my name is Kasey Marie McBlais and I am a mother of two beautiful 
children l’m testifying in support of LD 1726 An Act to Build Maine’s Economy by Supporting 
Child Care and Working Families 
I have two children Remington is 5 now and miss Fiona will be 3 in July In August of 2022 we 
were told that my son Remington, could no longer attend the inclusive full time 
preschool/childcare center that he had been attending for the previous 11 months 
Remi was having increasingly challenging behaviors and was requiring almost constant one on 
one support Several Ed Tech’s left the center and so they were no longer able to support Remi 
We had two weeks to find another place for him 
After scrambling we were able to enroll him into a two day/week public preK program with 
fingers crossed that it would be a good fit This meant that I had to stop working full time and 
drop down to twenty hours a week, in order to stay home with Remi on the days he was not in 
school It’s been 8 months since I made that decision and I continue to work just part time I’ve 
had a jOb I love, recruiting foster and adoptive families for 7 years Dropping down to part time 
meant we lost our medical, dental and vision insurance Nor do I earn sick time or paid time off 
anymore 
My choice was this try to ﬁnd childcare that was accessible (I live in rural Oxford county), tiy to 
find childcare that was of high quality (Remi was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD last 
summer), OR drop down to part time so that I could provide him with that childcare myselfI 
chose the latter because I used to be a BHP and an Ed Tech III I used to work with children in 
therapeutic foster care The fact is, there isn’t a childcare center within an hour from us thatI 
feel confident in being able to provide Remi with the quality, specialized care that he requires in 
order to thrive and be successful This was a difficult decision but in the end I chose to sacrifice 
my career and our financial stability so that I could ensure Remi would get the kind of care he 
needs and deserves 
It makes me wonder how many other families are having to make these difficult decisions ’? And 
how many of those are actually the same professionals and educators that my family is seeking 
for Remington ’? Providers are underpaid, adding to the instability of the child care supply 
Threatening the few resources that currently exist for Maine’s families will only make this crisis 
of child care worse 
The importance of comprehensive family resources and access to affordable, high-quality child 
care services cannot be overstated When we invest in these services, we invest in our state’s 
economy We improve the quality of life for children and enable more parents to return to work 
Without this bill, countless will have to continue choosing between their work or caring for their 
children
l’m asklng no, l’m urglng you to support thls b|ll If chlldcare professlonals and educators 
were belng pa|d a llvable wage then my Reml may have been able to stay at the center we 
loved He l|ke|y would not have been klcked out due to lack of stafﬁng Th|s b|ll w|ll lmprove 
Ma|ne’s chlldcare system whlch w|ll then |n turn, strengthen our economy 
Mame ch|ldren should mean more than a paycheck Remlngton and Flona should mean more 
than the next electlon cycle They are llterally our future and If we don’t start |nvest|ng |n chnldren 
and famllles now, then I really do fear for the future of Mame
