Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, my name is Melissa Harding and I am a mom of four amazing little 
humans I am a resident of Waldo County and I'm here today testifying in support of LD 1726 An 
Act to Build Maine's Economy by Supporting Child Care and Working Families 
I have struggled since moving to Maine and growing my family with access to childcare Shortly afterI 
moved here I heard the term daycare desert for the ﬁrst time I did not understand it then, and I do not 
understand anymore today I did not qualify for Head Start and we could not afford the one option that 
was a forty minute drive away The silver lining of covid for my family was that when my husband lost his 
j0b we became Head Start eligible, and it truly changed my life I wish that we did not have to be ina 
ﬁnancial cnsis to be eligible but my local Head Start agency became like family to me and the support my 
family received is something I will never forget They do this because they LOVE what they do 
Unfortunately over the course of my son's time in this program we have had several teachers who 
LOVED what they do leave, not because they wanted to, but because they had to My Son turned three 
and was accepted into the Pre-K program that was even closer to my home and I was so excited, it meant 
I would not spend two hours a day transporting him to and from school from Jackson to Belfast, my girls 
were not able to do this because four year olds take prionty Unfortunately before he could transition to 
that classroom the stafﬁng issue got worse and they were not able to accommodate him in the classroom 
This has now resulted in him being removed from Early Head Start and now he Wlll retum home with me 
and wait until he is hopefully able to return to a classroom in September Leaving a six month gap in early 
learning for a little boy who loves to go to school This IS also going to drastically affect my family 
ﬁnancially as I will have to reduce my hours and income We made so much progress and now we start 
over again This IS the case for way too many families trying to dig themselves out of poverty and causes 
parents to have to leave the workforce too, the ripple effect for communities is not sustainable Our Early 
Childhood Educators are superheroes, and they deserve to be paid way more than the increases this bill 
would provide However we need to start somewhere We can not keep losing these incredible educators 
to the public school system or the McDonaIds that IS offering a higher wage and better beneﬁts While 
classrooms continue to remain closed due to stafﬁng, and children remain on waiting lists, we know 
better We all know it does not make sense, we all know that they desen/e a livable wage, we all know 
that parents should not have to be home and leave the workforce because they can not access quality 
child care If we do not solve the workforce issue within Early Childhood Education then it isn't going to 
get better anywhere else lt is time to acknowledge their worth, and not with words, with ACTION It starts 
here with voting in favor of LD 1726 
Thank you for your time, 
Melissa Harding
