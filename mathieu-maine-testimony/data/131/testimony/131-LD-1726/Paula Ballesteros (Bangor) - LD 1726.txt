Daycare for my Family  
In 2021, my son and his wife were having their first child.  My daughter -in-law is an 
Licensed Practical Nurse  and  works 5 days a week in Home Care.  My son works in customer 
service at a local business from 7:30 – 5:00pm.  They currently drive 30 minutes one way to 
drive to Daycare.  
Several months before the baby was born  they visited Daycare Centers in the Bangor 
area.  They chose the Learning Garden which is currently on Broadway. They got put on a 
waiting list and knew they would not get full -time.  
When my granddaughter was born, my daughter -in-law was able to take maternity 
leave for 12 weeks.  As the  date to go b ack to work came closer, they were only able to have 2 
days a week for Daycare for an infant.  They were not sure what they were going to do.  They 
couldn’t afford to not work.  They were deciding who of the two made less and would have to 
stay home with t he baby.  My daughter -in-law was an essential worker.  My son was thinking 
he would have to stay home 3 days a week and work another job during the evenings or 
weekends.   
I decided to help my son and his wife.  I was 70 and was recovering from bilateral k nee 
replacements.  Since the baby was an infant I could physically do it.  My daughter -in-law’s 
mother  
 Also drove from Pittston near Augusta a couple of days a month to help with childcare as well.  
Over time, Daycare was able to add another day and then eventually  fulltime so she 
goes to Daycare 5 days a week.  If the chid gets sick or Daycare is on vacation, I fill in.  
The second issue with Daycare is the cost for a child to attend.  My son and daughter -in-
law feel they cannot afford a second child in D aycare so they are not planning to have more 
children .
