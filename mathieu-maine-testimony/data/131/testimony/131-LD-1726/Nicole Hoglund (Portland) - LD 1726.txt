Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Nicole
Hoglund.
I
am
an
Early
Childhood
Education
Director 
and
Owner
,
and
I
live
in
Portland.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s 
Economy
by
Supporting
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
I
support
raising
child
care
educator
wages
because
without
continued
support
our
state, 
economy,
families
and
in
turn
the
future
of
our
state
and
country
will
suffer.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it 
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
because
reality
is
important
and
currently
the
state 
is
not
making
decisions
reality
based
from
everything
from
subsidy
to
Rising
Stars.
I
support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families
because
the
current 
subsidy
does
not
reflect
actual
market
rates.
I
support
ensuring
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from
their 
program
because
by
constantly
creating
barriers
for
state
and
department
of
human
services, 
hurt
children,
families,
and
parents
that
want
to
return
to
the
workforce
and
be
part
of
the 
economy.
All
childcare
centers
are
based
on
enrollment
tuition
rates
whatever
you
wanna
call,
it 
are
based
on
tuition
not
on
days
attended
there
is
no
way
to
run
a
business.
If
you
only
charge 
parents
on
days
they
attend
what
teacher
do
you
say
in
any
given
week
sorry
you
don’t
get
full 
pay
because
Johnny
and
Susie
didn’t
attend
this
week.
It
is
just
not
based
on
reality
how
the 
system
is
currently
set
up
from
everything
from
subsidy
to
the
rising
star
demands
to
licensing. 
Nothing
really
is
reality
based
and
the
only
people
that
are
really
truly
suffering
are
the
children.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
because
buy
prolonging 
approvals,
which
is
a
direct
result
of
staff
shortages
people
lose
the
opportunity
and
available
to 
take
a
job
offered.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement 
because
there
is
truly
no
incentive
just
barriers
for
childcares
to
accept
a
subsidy.
Every
other 
parent
pays
tuition
either
weekly
or
biweekly,
and
to
force
childcare
programs
already
receiving 
a
lower
rate
than
what
other
families
pay
and
then
doubling
the
pain
that
you
feel
when
you 
accept
subsidy
families
by
prolonging
payment
periods
again
is
just
not
dealing
in
reality.
Why 
would
anybody
choose
this
route?
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD
1726,
Nicole
Hoglund
