Senator BaldaccI, RepresentatIve Meyer, and dIstInguIshed members of the Health and 
Human Sen/Ices CommIttee, my name Is CamelIa Babson-Haley and I am the DIrector 
of Youth and FamIly Outreach In Portland l’m testIfyIng In support of LD 1726 An Act to 
BuIld MaIne’s Economy by SupportIng ChIld Care and WorkIng FamIlIes 
In my 34 years In the ﬁeld I have never experIenced the InstabIlIty that Is compromIsIng 
the foundatIon of our Industry, at thIs current tIme Our workforce Is dIsappearIng We 
are a staff of 18, and sInce June 2020, 16 employees have resIgned, throwIng us Intoa 
constant and chaotIc hIrIng loop 75% of those that gave us theIr notIce c|ted 
Inadequate wages as the reason The early educatIon sector and the famIlIes that we 
serve have lost hIghly skIIled educators because they cannot afford to stay And the 
turnover has not ceased even wIth the wage supplements that are currently In place 
WhIle we are so very grateful, It IS not enough And despIte redIrectIng every fInancIal 
resource avaIlabIe at YFO to dIrect care staff wages, many of our staff work second j0bS 
and are stIlI strugglIng The addItIonal wage supports proposed In LD 1726 are 
desperately needed It Is tIme we recognIze that the people carIng for our youngest 
chIldren are carryIng out the most sIgnIfIcant work In our world They are developIng 
young braIns, layIng the foundatIon on whIch everythIng else wIll be buIlt for thIs lIttle 
human And as you know, they are the workforce behInd the workforce 
I would also lIke to talk about the elements In the bIll specIfIc to the chIldcare subsIdy 
YFO IntentIonally enrolls 60% of our chIldren from low-Income households Therefore, 
stabIlIty In the subsIdIes we receIve for these chIldren IS crItIcal It Is ImperatIve to our 
busIness model that the subsIdy program contInue to pay provIders based on 
enrollment and not attendance 
Furthermore, raIsIng subsIdy elIgIbIlIty and reducIng barrIers to applyIng are key to 
ensurIng Mame famIlIes can obtaIn and maIntaIn employment TIme and agaln I have 
heard from famIlIes that were denIed elIgIbIlIty because they were over the household 
Income by less than $1500 per year GIven the unprecedented InflatIon In the last year, 
famIlIes cannot keep up It Is heartbreakIng to hear theIr storIes 
I Implore you to support LD 1726 Together we can stabIIIze and rIght thIs shIp 
Thank you for hearIng me today
