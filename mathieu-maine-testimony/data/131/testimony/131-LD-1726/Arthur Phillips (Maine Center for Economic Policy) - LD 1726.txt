Child Care for Working Families 
Arthur Phl||lpS, Maine Center for Economic Policy 
May 10, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Committee 
on Health and Human Services, my name IS Arthur Phillips, and lam an analyst at the 
Maine Center for Economic Policy lam here to testify in support of LD 1726, An Act to Build 
Maine's Economy by Supporting Child Care for Working Families 
Recent years have taught us child care workers are truly essential Without them, other 
workers are forced to leave their iobs to care for young children, costing them earnings 
they need now and the savings to retire with dignity This burden IS felt by families in every 
corner of our state, but it particularly impacts rural areas and overwhelmingly falls on 
women to sacrifice their economic autonomy 
Maine lawmakers are well aware of the critical role of child care workers, which IS why last 
year legislators unanimously passed and the governor signed a bill to provide $200 
monthly supplements to our child care workers ‘This and other investments helped 
stabilize a system in freefall, as many of Maine's family and center-based child care 
providers permanently closed their doors during the pandemic Now, this bill gives our 
state the chance to blaze a trail toward a stable, accessible, high-quality child care system 
Caring for a family member IS one of the primary reasons people who wish to enter the 
labor force are not working or looking for work According to US Census Bureau data, 
24,000 Mainers cite a lack of available child care as the primary reason they aren't in the 
labor force " 
And while many issues impact the availability of child care, the primary factors 
are low wages for child care workers and the high costs of child care sen/ices 
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the median hourly wage for child care 
workers in Maine is lower than that of retail salespeople and food prep workers Even 
though many child care workers hold early childhood education degrees and prepare 
young children for school, they earn on average just 60 percent of what kindergarten 
teachers make and jUSt over half (53 5 percent) of what elementary school teachers earn "' 
If we want to attract and retain more people in a career that gives workers in every corner 
of the state the chance to stay in theiriobs, we must do better by them 
Low wages make it extremely difficult for child care centers to recruit and retain staffA 
2021 survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children found 85 
percent of child care centers in Maine were experiencing staffing shortages, with low wages

oven/vhelmmgly lC|entlflEd as the bnggest barrner to recruntment "’ A survey last year found 
the top challenges for Ma|ne‘s ch|ld care centers were grow|ng wa|tl|sts and staff 
shortages " And accordlng to one analysls, by the end of 2022 Mame had 280 fewer ch|ld 
care centers than two years earller "‘ 
Whlle Chlld care workers are pa|d low wages, for many parents the cost of chlld care |s 
elther out of reach or too h|gh to _|UStlfy staymg |n the workforce ln 2021, Ma|ne 
Department of Health and Human Servlces found the market rate for full-tlme toddler care 
at a llcensed center was more than $11,000 per year |n Washmgton County and over 
$14,000 In Cumberland County "" Accordnng to the US Department of Health and Human 
Servlces def|n|t|on of ch|ld care affordablllty, |nfant care |s affordable to only 11 9 percent 
of Mame fam|l1es ""'r 
The comb|nat|on of h|gh costs and low wages |s a market fallure that demonstrates why 
our state must make deeper mvestments lﬂ ch|ld care LD 1726 would help these tw|n 
nssues |n several ways 
F|rst, the bull would double the current wage supplements for ch|ld care workers from $200 
to $400 per month — In communmes throughout Mame, th|s extra money could make the 
dnfference between someone who loves her j0b leav|ng to make more money at a blg box 
store or fast-food restaurant, and one who contnnues pursumg her passnon as an early 
ch|ldhood educator 
Second, thls b|ll would expand el|g|b|l|ty to Ma|ne's Ch|ld Care Subsidy Program (CCSP) from 
85 percent to 125 percent of State Medlan Income, allowlng more workmg fam|l|es to 
afford the cost of ch|ld care and contlnue pursu|ng the|r careers Accordlng to the US 
Department of Health and Human Servlces, the current state med|an |ncome for a fam|ly of 
four |s $98,914 ‘X A young fam|ly w|th two workmg parents who earn th|s much and have 
two chlldren |n ch|Id care are currently |nel|g|ble for ass|stance, leavlng them to pay around 
25 percent of the|r |ncome on Chlld care Faced w|th th|s reallty, many workers, partncularly 
women, choose to leave the|r jObS 
Th|rd, th|s b|ll would set a long-term course to stab|l|ze the sector and asslst more fam|l|es 
Efforts to ra|se workers’ wages and expand access to subs|d|es are crltlcal to help|ng 
workers and fam|||es, but even w|th these steps, the ch|ld care system w||l face |nstab|l|ty 
That |s why LD 1726 would establnsh a cost-of-care model that nmportantly lI"|VO|VES the 
people most lmpacted by and knowledgeable about Chlld care - lncludlng educators, 
parents, and advocates - to comprehens|vely assesses what |t costs to offer h|gh-quallty 
early ch|ldhood educatlon wh|le paying workers a l|v|ng wage LD 1726 would use that 
robust cost-of-care study to set a course so that by 2030, low-mcome and w0rk|ng fam|l|es 
spend no more than 7 percent of the|r |ncome on ch|ld care
While it was true before the pandemic, we are now acutely aware of the critical role child 
care workers play in our economy LD 1726 presents the rare opportunity to invest in 
workers and families so they can thrive and our children can grow up with all the beneﬁts 
of high-quality early education We urge you to vote ought to pass
