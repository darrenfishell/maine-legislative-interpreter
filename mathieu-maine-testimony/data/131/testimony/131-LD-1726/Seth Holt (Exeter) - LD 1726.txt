Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Seth
Holt.
I
am
a
Childcare
Business
Manager,
and
I
live
in 
Exeter.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by
Supporting 
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
Child
care
educators
are
developing
the
minds
of
our
youth.
Their
efforts
are
extraordinary
but 
current
wages
are
not
a
good
reflection
of
the
work
and
dedication
these
educators
have
for 
children.
Unfortunately
there
is
an
imbalance
between
what
a
family
is
willing
to
pay
for 
childcare,
overhead
costs
of
running
a
childcare
business,
and
regulations
on
the
industry
that 
results
in
the
inability
to
pay
higher
wages
to
educators
while
running
a
viable
business,
which
is 
why
I
support
a
state
plan
that
raises
child
care
educator
wages.
Right
now
the
industry
struggles
to
balance
what
is
affordable
for
working
families,
industry 
regulation,
and
overhead
expenses
to
run
a
viable
business.
Any
child
care
is
expensive, 
quality
child
care
is
even
more
expensive
yet
there
is
still
an
imbalance
between
what
families 
are
willing
to
pay
and
running
a
viable
business.
Something
needs
to
be
done
to
offset
the
cost 
of
running
a
business,
paying
livable
wages,
and
providing
quality
care.
D  eveloping
a
cost 
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and 
education
would
help
with
that.
I
support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families
because
the
cost
of 
childcare
is
often
equivalent
to
or
more
than
a
mortgage
for
one
child.
Additional
children
force 
many
families
to
decide
between
working
to
simply
pay
for
childcare
or
having
a
parent
stay 
home.
Childcare
is
likely
to
cost
families
$6/hr
based
on
a
40
hour
week.
Nearly
half
of 
minimum
wage
pay
could
be
going
to
childcare.
I
also
support
ensuring
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from 
their
program
because
regardless
of
attendance
of
a
child
on
subsidy,
employers
need
to
staff 
according
to
childcare
ratios.
Programs
succeed
on
full
capacity
enrollment,
get
by
on
85% 
enrolment,
and
struggle
with
anything
less.
Programs
generally
require
payment
for
private
pay 
families
regardless
of
attendance
as
we
are
unable
to
fill
a
spot
for
an
absence.
The
industry
needs
all
around
support.
Childcare
is
not
a
lucrative
business
yet
is
a
significant, 
primary,
and
necessary
expense
for
most
families
to
continue
working.
Childcare
providers
are 
not
in
the
industry
to
get
rich,
they
are
here
because
they
love
YOUR
children
and
help
them 
grow,
which
is
why
Maine
needs
to
develop
a
long
term
plan
to
increase
investments
in
child 
care
programs
while
also
increasing
subsidy
eligibility.
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD
1726,
Seth
Holt
