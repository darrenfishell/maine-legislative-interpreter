In

Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Michelle
Belanger
and
I
am
an
Early
Childhood
Educator
of
over
20
years
working
in
Portland.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by
Supporting
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
I
fully
support
LD
1726
and
believe
that
it
is
crucial
to
raise
child
care
educator
wages
in
Maine.
Child
care
providers
play
a
vital
role
in
supporting
families
and
communities,
and
they
deserve
fair
compensation
for
their
hard
work
and
dedication.
We
are
facing
a
time
where
the
majority
of
children’s
caregivers
are
needed
in
the
workforce
and
children
under
the
age
of
5
deserve
quality
early
care
and
education
by
educators
who
are
well
compensated
and
committed
to
the
field.
After
hearing
of
the
unanimous
vote
to
approve
starting
wages
for
our
K-12
teachers,
why
is
the
same
consideration
not
being
applied
for
the
educators
who
are
preparing
our
youngest
children
at
the
most
critical
time
in
their
lives?
I
also
believe
that
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
is
essential.
By
having
a
more
accurate
understanding
of
the
costs
involved,
we
can
make
better
decisions
and
provide
better
support
to
child
care
providers.
For
years,
childcare
providers
and
institutions
have
been
subsidizing
the
cost
of
early
childhood
education
by
keeping
costs
at
a
level
where
working
parents
can
afford
to
send
their
children
and
because
of
that,
can
not
afford
to
compensate
educators
what
they
are
worth
or
even
charge
the
true
cost
of
care
for
the
children
in
care.
Making
this
a
losing
financial
model
on
all
fronts.
Furthermore,
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine's
lower-income
families
is
critical
to
ensuring
that
every
child
has
access
to
quality
child
care.
It
is
important
that
we
support
families
in
need
and
provide
them
with
the
resources
necessary
to
give
their
children
the
best
possible
start
in
life.
The
gap
between
what
families
can
afford
and
what
childcare
costs,
is
just
going
to
grow.
Especially
in
a
time
where
resources
for
at-risk
children
and
families
are
at
an
all
time
low
and
people
can
make
more
money
doing
work
that
is
far
less
important
for
the
foundation
of
our
economy.
I
also
support
the
proposal
to
ensure
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from
their
program.
This
will
provide
more
stable
funding
for
child
care
programs
and
enable
providers
to
budget
more
effectively.
Would
you
expect
to
only
pay
a
portion
of
your
car
payment
if
you
don't
drive
your
car
for
a
day
or
two?
How
are
centers
supposed
to
budget
for
subsidy
payments
for
when
(not
if)
children
get
sick
and
are
out
or
are
able
to
spend
a
day
at
home
with
a
parent,
who
typically
works?
This
is
going
to
cause
providers
to
not
want
to
accept
child
care
subsidies,
which
will
furthermore
add
to
the
unavailability
of
childcare
slots
overall.
Providing
funding
to
pay
for
child
care
for
child
care
employees
is
also
essential.
This
will
ensure
that
child
care
providers
can
afford
to
care
for
their
own
children
while
providing
care
for
others.
At
least
half
of
my
educators
are
forced
to
work
a
second
job
to
make
ends
meet.
By
not
having
to
worry
about
a
childcare
payment,
will
allow
them
to
engage
more
in
the
childcare
field
and
commit
to
the
children
they
are
working
with
and
not
be
worried
about
having
to
work
a
second
job
at
night
or
on
the
weekends.
Finally,
I
support
the
proposal
to
shorten
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
and
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement.
This
will
make
the
process
more
efficient
and
allow
providers
to
receive
the
support
they
need
more
quickly.
At
my
center,
we
get
no
less
than
10
people
who
knock
on
our
door
every
week,
looking
for
childcare
for
their
children.
These
caregivers
are
often
met
with
an
explanation
of
how
to
get
on
our
waitlist
in
tandem
with
figuring
out
financial
payments.
When
applying
for
child
care
subsidy,
it
can
take
up
to
30
days
to
become
approved
and
another
2-3
weeks
to
receive
payment.
I
could
not
imagine
telling
my
employer
that
I
would
love
to
accept
an
offer
of
employment,
in
30
days
when
I
get
approved
for
childcare
subsidy.
Also,
I
couldn’t
imagine
any
business
having
to
wait
2-3
weeks
for
payments
for
services
or
goods
already
given.
Again,
this
leads
to
less
and
less
providers
willing
to
take
child
care
subsidy
and
more
and
more
families
left
without
care
during
this
critical
time
in
a
child’s
development.
Overall,
LD
1726
is
an
important
step
in
improving
and
rebuilding
Maine's
child
care
system
and
ensuring
that
every
child
has
access
to
quality
care
and
education.
I
urge
the
Legislature
to
support
this
bill
and
invest
in
the
future
of
our
children,
families
and
communities.
Thank
you
