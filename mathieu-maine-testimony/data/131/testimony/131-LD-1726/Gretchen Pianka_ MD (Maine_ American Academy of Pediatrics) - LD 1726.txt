TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF  
LD 1726: An Act to Build Maine's Economy by Supporting Child  
Care for Working Families  
 
Good day, Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan, and honorable 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs.  
 My name is Gretchen Pianka. I am a resident of Brunswick and an active 
member of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.  
 
As an expert in resilience building for children and families and a pediatrician who 
has practiced in Maine for almost 20 years, it is clear to me that this initiative, 
which supports quality childcare for working families, will also help those families 
foster resilience and decrease the long- term impact of adversity.  
 
All too often, when families are struggling, they are not able to access the 
supports and resources needed to address challenges. Child care is an essential 
service that provides supportive environments for children’s early learning and 
healthy development. Child care is also an essential support for parents to be 
able to reliably work, so they can provide for the economic security of their 
families. Additionally, as noted in the newly releas ed state’s Child Safety and 
Family Well- being Plan, child care provides a protective factor for families, to 
counteract risks they may be experiencing to safety and stability.  
 
Funding efforts that increase the availability of affordable, high- quality chi ld care 
now will reduce the impact of the stress families are experiencing by buffering it 
with this critical protective factor. This has been proven to decrease the long- term 
mental health impact of childhood adversity and will increase the chance of a 
healthy future for all Maine's children and their families.
