LD 1726 An Act to BuIld MaIne's Economy by Supportlng ChIld Care and WorkIng FamIlIes 
Senator BaldaccI, RepresentatIve Meyer, and dIstInguIshed members of the Health and Human 
ServIces CommIttee, my name Is Rebekah Col|Ins and I am an elementary school teacher anda 
parent of young chIIdren l'm testIfyIng In support of LD 1726 An Act to BuIld MaIne’s Economy 
by SupportIng Child Care and WorkIng FamIlIes 
ln order for a famrly of four to qualIfy for chIld care subsIdy they have to make less that 
$84,076 90 a year The average cost of chIldcare In Kennebec county for two chIldren under 5 Is 
$20,800 a year. ThIs IS 25% of theIr Income If a famIly makes slIghtly over these income 
guIdelInes they wIll be payIng almost a quarter of theIr Income towards chIldcare ThIs Isa 
substantIal ﬁnancIal burden on these famIlIes My famIly decIded for me to stay home for5 
years because If l was workIng we would not qualIfy for chIldcare assIstance but we would not 
be able to make enough to pay our bIlls after payIng for chIldcare I have multIple frIends that 
have had sImIlar expenences People that were wIIlIng, able and qualIfIed to do _|0b$ In 
educatIon, socIal sewices and medIcal ﬁelds but could not take those ]ObS because they dId not 
qualIfy for chIldcare assIstance We have major concerns In our state about our workforce 
shortage One of the maIn ways that we can help Increase our workforce Is by makIng childcare 
more accessIble One way to do thIs IS by raIsIng the Income lImIts for chIld care subsIdIes No 
famIly should be paymg 25% of theIr Income towards chIldcare 
Our chIldcare provrders are entrusted wIth one of our state's most precIous thmgs, our 
chIldren Our famIlIes need to trust that theIr chIldren wIll be safe and cared for In order for 
parents to trust theIr chIldren In a chIldcare settmg they want to know that they are beIng cared 
for by hIghly qua|Iﬁed staff These staff members requlre traInIng, educatIon and experIence 
They desen/e to be compensated at a level that respects that experIence and educatIon 
AccordIng to the Bureau of Labor statIstIcs the average salary for a chIldcare worker In MaIne Is 
$15 42 an hour For an employee that works 40 hours a week thIs works out to $32,700 a year 
Most of these posItIons requIre an assocIate ‘s degree WorkIng In chIldcare Is a hard ]Ob These 
caregivers are beIng gIven responsIbIlIty for a human beIng They do more than jUSt care for 
chIldren They teach them, they comfort them, they encourage them and they help them grow 
TheIr contrIbutIon to our socIety Is ImperatIve and they need to be compensated faIrly for that 
contrIbutIon 
I encourage you to put the needs of chlldren and famIlIes ﬁrst by strengthenIng 
chIldcare 
Thank you
