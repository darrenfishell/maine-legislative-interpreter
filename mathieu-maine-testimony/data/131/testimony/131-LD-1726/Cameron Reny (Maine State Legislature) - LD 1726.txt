Testimony of Senator Cameron Reny 
Supporting LD 1726, “An Act to Build Maine’s Economy by Supporting Child 
Care for Working Families ” 
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee On 
Health and Human Services, I am Senator Cameron Reny, and I represent Senate District 13, which 
mcludes most of Lincoln County and the towns of Washington and Windsor I am here today to testify 
in strong support of LD 1726, “An Act to Build Maine’s Economy by Supporting Child Care for Working 
Families” 
First, I want to thank President Jackson for sponsoring this essential bill As a mother and school 
counselor, I understand ﬁrsthand the vital role child care plays in the lives of Maine families and our 
economy 
Child care 1S the backbone of our workforce, enabling parents to work, contribute to our economy, and 
provide for their families Unfortunately, our current child care system falls short of meeting the needs 
of our children, families, and businesses 
Insufﬁcient child care options have negatively impacted businesses across the state, from small local 
shops to large employers Many workers, particularly women, have had to reduce their work hours or 
leave the workforce altogether due to a lack of affordable and accessible child care This challenge 
hinders our economy from meetmg its full potential 
The lack of child care has been especially difficult for families in rural areas, where a sigmﬁcant number 
of Mainers live in child care "deserts " 
The costs of child care are overwhelming for many families, often 
exceeding the cost of housing or college tuition I am someone fortunate enough to be able to afford 
childcare costs in my rural area, however, I still struggled to ﬁnd placements for my children when they 
reached an age they could legally go to a childcare facility I ended up having to take extra time off Work 
while waiting for an open slot This combination is a ﬁnancial burden on our families 
The consequences of not addressmg this issue extend beyond the immediate impact on Maine's economy 
This bill plays a critical role in fostering child development by investing in high-quality early care and 
education programs The ﬁrst few years of life are incredibly important, developmentally speaking By 
increasing fimding for Head Start programs and supporting child care providers, LD 1726 ensures that 
our youngest citizens have access to safe and nurturing learning environments

Senator, D1str1ct 13 l3 lst Leglslature Augusta, Ma1ne 04333 
These ch1ld-care centers are staffed by well-tra1ned educators who foster warm and lovmg relat10nsh1ps 
between caregwers and ch1ldren These kmds of relat1onsh1ps are cruc1al for bu1ld1ng self-con ﬁdence, 
res1l1ence, and commun1cat1on sk1lls The people prov1d1ng these servrces deserve farr compensat1on for 
therr servrces I’ve spoken w1th many early clnldcare provlders who are consummate professronals, love 
the1r _]0bS, and st1ll have regular doubts about the1r chorce of career due to the wages One who works 
w1th my chtldren wonders 1f she’ll ever be able to move out of her parent’s house 1f she stays 1n th1s 
profess1on 
LD 1726 takes necessary steps towards addressrng these challenges by 1ncreas1ng fundrng and support 
for ch1ld care provlders, expandmg subsldy el1g1b1l1ty for fam1l1es, and 1nvest1ng 1n early clnldhood 
educatlon programs l1ke Head Start Addltlonally, th1s b1ll creates a scholarslup program for ch1ld care 
pr0v1ders' clnldren, establlshes an 1ndependent appeals process for lrcensmg dec1s1ons, and requlres an 
annual report to the leglslature on 1ncreas1ng subsldy enrollment and reduclng barrlers to part1c1pat1on 
We have a ch1ld care cr1s1s 1n our state We must provrde better paths for ch1ld care workers to recelve 
professlonal development and falr compensat1on As 1t stands, early ch1ld care teachers earn s1gmﬁcantly 
less than other teachers, wlnch contrlbutes to poor staff retent1on and a struggle to h1re quallﬁed 
provlders By mcreasmg wage supplements and 1nvest1ng 1n profess1onal development, LD 1726 w1ll 
help ensure that our chrldren rece1ve the best care poss1ble from h1ghly sktlled educators 
In concluslon, LD 1726 1s essentlal not only for the well-be1ng of our chrldren and fam1l1es but also for 
the growth and susta1nab1l1ty of Ma1ne's economy I urge you to support th1s b1ll and help bu1ld a better 
futtue for Ma1ne's worklng fam1l1es and the commtuntles they call home 
Thank you for your t1me and cons1derat1on I’m happy to answer any questlons you may have 
Smcerely, 
Cameron Reny
