Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Karina
Zellou.
I
am
a
teacher/caregiver,
and
I
live
in 
Westbrook.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by
Supporting 
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
I
support
raising
childcare
educator
wages
because
it
is
a
demanding
job
that
should
have 
qualified
and
able
individuals
in
the
work
space.
In
order
to
shape
the
youth
and
future 
generations,
we
need
teachers
who
love
to
teach
and
have
education
backgrounds.
To
have 
this,
we
need
to
be
paying
a
live-able
wage.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it 
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
because
I
believe
it
would
give
more
insight
on
what 
it
takes
to
create
quality
care.
We
need
resources,
materials,
educated
individuals, 
communication
with
the
community,
etc.
And
a
useful
way
of
understanding
this
would
be
by 
developing
a
cost
model
tool.
I
support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families
because
trying
to
provide 
and
exist
is
so
hard
these
days.
Trying
to
make
ends
meet
with
a
family
is
close
to
impossible 
for
average
income
let
alone
lower
income
families
and
every
child
has
a
right
to
quality
care 
and
education.
I
support
ensuring
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from
their 
program
because
every
child
deserves
a
quality
care
education.
If
the
reimbursement
covers 
days
when
children
are
absent,
that
can
ensure
that
the
provider
gets
compensated
in
order
for 
the
school
to
function
while
also
ensuring
the
child
continues
their
education.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
long
term
plan
to
increase
investments
in
child
care
programs 
while
also
increasing
subsidy
eligibility
because
this
ensures
a
means
for
every
child
to
get
the 
education
they
deserve.
No
child
falling
through
the
education
system.
support
increasing
Head
Start
eligibility
and
funding
because
we
need
the
experienced
teachers 
to
create
meaningful
lesson
and
teaching.
We
need
the
funds
to
keep
these
teachers. 
Increasing
head
start
eligibility
would
also
help
decrease
the
amount
of
students
not
getting
the 
education
they
deserve.
I
support
providing
funding
to
pay
for
child
care
for
child
care
employees
because
childcare 
wages
are
low
but
childcare
expenses
are
high.
How
is
that
fair?
How
is
that
live-able?
This 
would
help
families
create
a
life
for
themselves
and
their
loved
ones.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
because
it
seems
like
a
lot
of 
time
is
wasted
that
the
child
could
be
getting
an
education.
I
also
support
shortened
time 
periods
for
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement
because
the
child
should
be 
getting
a
proper
education.
Shortening
the
time
periods
would
assist
with
this.
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD
1726,
Karina
Zellou
