Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Cierra
Astor.
I
am
a
parent
and
a
financial
services 
representative
,
and
I
live
in
Bath.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s 
Economy
by
Supporting
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
I
support
raising
child
care
educator
wages
because
underpaid
wages
for
childcare
educators 
are
one
of
the
top
reasons
why
there
is
no
availability
for
childcare.
There
are
no
openings 
because
workers
are
underpaid
and
can
work
at
a
retail
or
grocery
store
and
make
more 
money.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it 
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
because
how
do
you
know
what
it
truly
cost
to 
provide
quality
care
in
today's
world?
Everything
has
increased.
Gas,
food,
shelter.
The
basic 
necessities
we
need
to
live.
Allow
the
future
generation
to
not
only
survive
but
to
thrive.
I
support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families
because
until
you
have 
been
affected
by
the
subsidy
guidelines
you
don't
understand
how
truly
difficult
it
is
to
raise
a 
family.
My
family
lost
our
subsidy
because
we
were
200
dollars
a
month
over
income.
I
got
my 
annual
raise
and
just
like
that
zero
assistance.
Raise
the
subsidy.
It
helps
children
get
the
care 
they
need
and
parents
can
work
to
get
out
of
the
lower
income.
I
support
ensuring
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from
their 
program
because
r  atios
are
designed
to
protect
the
children.
If
one
child
is
sick
and
doesn't
go 
to
daycare
the
childcare
worker
still
shows
up.
By
not
reimbursing
the
absent
days
parents
are 
going
to
want
to
send
their
sick
children
in
to
make
sure
their
subsidy
isn't
taken
away.
Why 
should
kids
be
punished
for
being
sick.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
long
term
plan
to
increase
investments
in
child
care
programs 
while
also
increasing
subsidy
eligibility
because
isn't
investing
literally
to
put
money
into
things 
for
the
future
that
matter?
This
is
probably
the
only
thing
that
matters.
Invest
in
the
next 
generations
education.
They
will
lead
our
country
someday.
And
I
hope
it's
better
than
things 
are
now.
I
support
increasing
Head
Start
eligibility
and
funding
because
Head
start
is
insanely
important 
it's
that
first
crucial
step
to
education.
Children
build
basic
communication,
emotional.
Empathy, 
compassion.
If
it
weren't
for
head
start
and
early
childhood
education
programs
my
child
would 
not
be
speaking
today.
At
4
years
old
he
was
extremely
behind
in
his
language.
I
needed 
assistance
to
pay
for
his
speech
therapy.
As
a
single
mom
I
made
it
work.
With
no
help
from
the 
other
parent,
I
might
add.
The
state
needs
to
do
better
at
making
sure
the
custodial
parent
gets 
help.
We
didn't
ask
to
do
this
alone!
I
support
for
my
childcare
employees
to
be
paid
what
they
are
worth.
They
are
teaching
our 
children.
The
next
generation
that
will
face
many
challenges
in
their
lives
as
we
do
now.
We 
need
them
to
show
up
and
care,
and
be
compensated
for
the
impossible
job
that
the
do
every 
day.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
determining
subsidy
eligibility
because
Maine
is
one
of
the 
hardest
states
to
get
assistance
in.
Why
does
it
takes
WEEKS
for
you
to
process
an
application 
that
way
emailed.
We
need
childcare
now!
Implement
a
temporary
coverage
if
nothing
else
to 
provide
a
smoother
transition
for
families.
Most
of
us
will
lose
our
job
before
getting
approved.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement 
because
it
is
so
obvious
to
me.
But
in
case
it
isn't
to
all
of
legislation
when
you
pay
for
an
item 
you
want
it
now.
You
have
that
right.
Don't
ask
our
childcare
programs
to
front
the
cost.
It's 
ridiculous
and
cruel
to
watch
them
struggle.
Inmates
are
simply
treated
with
more
respect
than 
our
youth.
Please

Astor
