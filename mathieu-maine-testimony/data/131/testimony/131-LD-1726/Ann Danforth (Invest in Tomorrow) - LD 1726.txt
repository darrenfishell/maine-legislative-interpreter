Testimony on Behalf of Invest in Tomorrow in support of LD 1726, An Act to Build Maine's Economy by 
Supporting Child Care for Working Families 
May 10, 2023 
Good morning Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee My name is Ann Danforth and I use she/her pronouns I'm a Policy Advocate at Maine Equal 
Justice, a nonproﬁt legal aid provider working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for 
people in Maine I am here today to testify in support of this bill on behalf of Invest in Tomorrow 
Invest in Tomorrow IS an initiative undertaken in 2017 by Maine organizations, businesses and 
individuals, to cut Maine's child poverty rate in half over the next ten years, while at the same time, 
strengthening Maine's workforce Invest in Tomorrow's work IS rooted in the belief that we all havea 
stake in addressing child poverty Poverty challenges our schools, our health care system, our 
communities, our workforce, and our economy Invest in Tomorrow envisions a world in which families 
can meet their basic needs to thrive and ﬁnd gainful, sustainable employment, lifting their families out of 
poverty and setting us all on a better path To that end, we work towards promising policy solutions that 
will increase the likelihood that every Maine child gets what they need to have a fair shot at a bright 
future, like the bill before you today 
In 2017 and 2018, Invest in Tomorrow held child poverty forums in various parts of the state 
experiencing higher levels of poverty, including in Androscoggin, Aroostook, Piscataquis and Washington 
counties We conducted follow-up meetings, interviews with stakeholders statewide, and conducted an 
online survey with over 180 respondents From this, we identified the need for more quality and 
affordable child care and early education as a primary focus for the initiative
These findings are also in line with the state's 10 Year Economic Development Plan and supported by 
recommendations from the Governor's Economic Recovery Committee Both prioritize creating a high 
quality, accessible, and affordable early care and education system and highlight the need to build the 
infrastructure needed to attract and support workers to participate in the economy By building a 
stronger child care system for the benefit of both parents and children, LD 1726 supports the goals laid 
out in these plans 
Quality, affordable child care and early learning is critical to helping Maine families enter and stay in 
the workforce \ 
Even before the pandemic, a shortage of quality, affordable child care and early education was one of 
the most common barriers to finding and keeping a ]Ob for parents with low income Close to 70% of 
Maine children under the age of SIX live in households in which all parents are working, according to the 
most recent data 3V8|l3bl81 We know that if these parents don't have access to child care, they can't go 
to work In addition to the shortage of supply, parents face the significant barrier of affordability 
According to the most recent Kids Count Databook, the average cost of infant care in Maine is $11,700 
When compared to other household expenses, child care can exceed housing costs and college tuition2 
Quality child care and early learning help set children up for success 
In addition to enabling parents to work, high-quality early learning experiences are important in their 
own right They help set children on a path to success in school, leading to higher education and a career, 
with low income children and English learners benefiting the most 3 
Our state's future prosperity and 
workforce depend on our youngest children getting what they need to learn, grow, thrive, and become 
the adults who will strengthen our communities and build our economy

Research shows the long-term beneﬁts of quality, early learning experiences Programs that begin at 
birth lead to better outcomes for children and yield up to a 13% annual return on public investment4 
LD 1726 would beneﬁt children, families, and employers 
This bill would help begin to address the child care crisis in our state and move us towards the goal of 
limiting child care costs within the next ten years so that families are not paying more than 7% of their 
income towards child ca re It would increase eligibility and access to the Child Care Subsidy Program, a 
hugely beneficial program for families with low- to moderate-incomes in the state It would also speed 
up eligibility determinations, which can be a barrier to a parent being able to start a new j0b The bill 
would require a report that evaluates and makes recommendations as to how the state could increase 
enrollment and reduce barriers to families receivingchild care subsidies 
This bill also makes critical investments in our state's child care workers - the backbone of our workforce 
- who allow for parents to work and provide essential learning and development experiences for Maine's 
future workers and leaders 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, we support LD 1726 because it advances the goals of lnvest in Tomorrow by helping to 
ensure parents and caregivers have access to quality, affordable child care and early learning so they can 
sustain employment while providing their children with the support and learning necessary for healthy 
development Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of this bill I am happy to 
answer any questions you may have
