Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human 
Services
Committee,
my
name
is
Colleen
Pasqualini.
I
am
an
accountant
and
a
parent,
and
I 
live
in
Scarborough.
I’m
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1726
An
Act
to
Build
Maine’s
Economy
by 
Supporting
Child
Care
and
Working
Families.
I
support
raising
child
care
educator
wages
because
we
are
a
two
income
household
and 
greatly
depend
on
our
child
care
educators/providers.
My
children
spend
more
time
with
them 
than
me
during
the
week
and
I
highly
value
having
educators
that
are
experienced, 
knowledgeable,
and
resourceful.
I
know
that
my
husband
are
struggling
to
purchase
a
home 
and
I
can
imagine
that
our
providers
are
also
dealing
with
similar
struggles.
I
support
all
of
us 
earning
a
wage
that
we
can
support
ourselves
in
this
inflationary
economy.
I
support
Maine
developing
a
cost
model
tool
that
better
supports
our
understanding
of
what
it 
costs
to
provide
quality
care
and
education
because
information
can
only
be
more
helpful
to 
provide
more
informed
decisions.
The
economy
has
been
so
rapidly
changing
these
last
few 
years.
I
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
ramifications
of
how
this
is
truly
effecting
these 
systems
that
have
no
room
to
absorb
these
fluctuations.
I
support
raising
subsidy
eligibility
for
Maine’s
lower
income
families
because
it
cannot
be 
overstated
enough,
the
economy
is
extremely
difficult
at
this
moment.
Housing
is
unaffordable, 
grocery
costs
have
risen,
gas
has
risen,
every
basic
staple
cost
of
living
day
to
day
has
risen 
and
that
is
affecting
all
families.
I
support
ensuring
that
subsidy
reimbursement
covers
days
when
children
are
absent
from
their 
program
because
if
a
child
is
absent,
it
does
not
lower
the
cost
of
operating
the
program.
The 
program
still
needs
to
be
open,
have
the
staff
available
for
the
ratio
of
children
that
could
be 
there
that
day.
All
of
the
families
depend
on
the
child
care
program
being
open.
Could
there
be
a 
food
credit
for
the
day
but
allow
reimbursement
for
the
staff
and
facility
instead?
I
support
Maine
developing
a
long
term
plan
to
increase
investments
in
child
care
programs 
while
also
increasing
subsidy
eligibility
because
our
children
are
our
future.
If
you
look
at
the 
news
and
listen
to
the
adults
disputing
unintelligible
opinions
that
are
divisive
and
disruptive
and 
upsetting.
We
owe
it
to
our
children
to
do
better
and
to
provide
them
with
a
safe
environment 
that
will
foster
their
growth.
Investing
in
education
is
the
best
investment
we
as
a
society
can 
make.
I
support
providing
funding
to
pay
for
child
care
for
child
care
employees
because
they
have 
families
too.
If
they
can't
work
because
their
wages
can't
support
paying
child
care
costs 
themselves,
then
all
of
our
families
are
affected.
It
becomes
a
snowball
affect.
We
moved
here 
to
Maine
in
2021
and
could
not
find
childcare
for
my
2
year
old.
It
took
a
full
year
for
a
spot
to 
open
up
because
so
many
facilities
had
waiting
lists
and
so
many
facilities
had
closed.
It
was
so 
disruptive
and
stressful.
I
was
working
all
night
so
that
I
could
take
care
of
my
son
during
the 
day.
I
couldn't
afford
to
not
work.
I
support
shortened
time
periods
for
child
care
programs
receiving
subsidy
reimbursement 
because
childcare
programs
need
to
pay
their
costs
timely
including
wages,
food
costs, 
supplies.
The
sooner
they
receive
their
subsidy
reimbursement,
the
better.
It
is
difficult
for
any 
business
to
float
the
costs
for
such
large
expenses
for
any
length
of
time.
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD
1726,
Colleen
Pasqualini
