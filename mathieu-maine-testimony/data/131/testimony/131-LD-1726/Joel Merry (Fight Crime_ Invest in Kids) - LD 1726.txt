Chalrs Baldaccr and Myer, and d1st1ngu1shed members of the Health and Human Servlees 
Commrttee, I am Joel Merry, Sherrff 1n Sagadahoc County and a 15-year member of Elgm 
Crrme Invest 1n Krds, a natlonal ant1-crlme organ1zat10n made up of more than 5,000 law 
enforcement leaders — chlefs, shenffs and prosecutors, from every state 1n our great nat1on, 140 
of whom are here 1n Mame As members we focus on research-proven programs that help 
chrldren get the rlght start 1n llfe, stay on track, and avo1d contact w1th crrme We help the 
pubhc, communlty leaders and pohcymakers, l1ke all of you, ﬁnd the Wrsdom 1n 1nvest1ng 1n 
quallty prograrnm1ng for our youngest chlldren 
In add1t1on to belng Sagadahoc County’s current Sherlff, I am a former Presldent of the Mame 
Shenffs Assoc1at1on I am also a father, a grandfather, and an act1ve communrty member In 
fact, I spend a fa1r amount of trme at the Bath YMCA, whlch has our area’s largest ch1ld care 
program In the past I have test1ﬁed before several Commlttees about all of these experlences I 
am pleased to do so agaln today and testlfy before you 1n support of LD 1726 
I do not profess to be an expert on ch1ld care, however I can tell you as someone who has worked 
w1th many chlld care provrders, that they are amazlng 1nd1v1duals They are the key to parents 
berng able to go to work and be fully attent1ve to thelr _]ObS Because parents know the1r klds are 
safe and well cared for 
I offer th1s Commrttee a unrque perspectrve on h1gh-qual1ty early learnlng — 1ts rmpact on 
crrme I have been 1n law enforcement for my entrre 40+- year career And I have seen how the 
lack of properly supervlsed act1v1t1es can lead klds down the wrong path 
Today I want to share that hrgh-quallty early learn1ng programs are also a great cr1me reductron 
strategy 
Some 1n th1s room know what the research tells us about what a cr1t1ca1 t1me the ﬁrst ﬁve years 
of l1fe are for a ch1ld’s physrcal, emotronal, soc1al, and cognrtrve development The early 
educators wlth us th1s mormng are experts on these toplcs

What 1s equally rmportant, but less well known, 1s that quallty early leam1ng programs can also 
slgnlﬁcantly reduce the chances of a chrld groW1ng up to be lnvolved 1n cr1me 
Research clearly shows that h1gh-qual1ty early care and educatron for at-rlck k1ds not only 
reduces the1r l1kel1hood of commrttlng a crlme later 1n l1fe, but also provldes far greater savmgs 
than costs A study of the Chlcago Ch1ld-Parents Centers shows these facts These centers 
prov1ded school readmess programs to 100,000 preschoolers from some of Ch1cago’s toughest 
ne1ghborhoods over the course of 30 years At age 18, the study examlned outcomes fora 
subgroup of these ch1ldren and matched those outcomes Wrth a peer group of s1m1lar k1ds not 
enrolled 1n the Centers The study showed that k1ds who d1d not recerve qual1ty early learnlng 
programs were 70 percent more llkely to have been arrested for a vlolent crlme by age 
18. By age 24, the now young adults who were 1n the Chlld-Parent Center program as chrldren 
were 20 percent less l1kely to have served t1me 1n Ja1l 
In add1t1on, these programs also save money A Well-respected mdependent cost-bene ﬁt analysls 
of nearly 20 d1fferent studles showed that h1gh-qual1ty early leammg programs can, on average, 
return a “proﬁt” (econom1c beneﬁts m1nus cost) to soc1ety of nearly $22,000 for every ch1ld 
served 
Young chlldren expenence a perrod of cr1t1cal bram development durrng the1r ear11est 
years Research shows that the experrences chrldren have 1n those years set the foundat1on for 
future development and success 
We know that the best way to keep chrldren on a path away from cnme as they grow 1s to reach 
them as early as possrble 
For all of these reasons, I encourage th1s Commrttee to unan1mous1y support LD 1726
