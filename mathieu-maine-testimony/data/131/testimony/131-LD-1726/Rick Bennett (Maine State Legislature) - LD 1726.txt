Testlmony of Senator Richard Bennett 
before the Joint Standing Commlttee on Health and Human Services 
LD 1726, “An Act to Bulld Ma1ne's Economy by Supportmg Ch11d Care for Worklng Fam111es ” 
May 10, 2023 
Cha1r Baldacc1, Chalr Meyer, d1st1ngu1shed colleagues on the Health and Human Servlces 
Comm1ttee I am Senator R1ck Bennett of Oxford, and I have the honor of serv1ng 14 
commun1t1es 1n Westem Ma1ne 1n the State Senate I am pleased to cosponsor LD 1726, “An 
Act to Bu1ld Ma1ne's Economy by Supportlng Ch1ld Care for Work1ng Fam1l1es” 
Many of you may know that I serve as the Senate Cha1r of the Ma1ne Ch1ldren ’s Caucus, a 
pos1t1on I’ve held for the past three years, along w1th my House Co-Cha1r Representatlve 
Rebecca Mlllett By des1gn, the Ch1ldren ’s Caucus 1s b1part1san and b1cameral w1th the m1ss1on 
to 1mprove the effectlveness and reach of pol1cy des1gned to pos1t1vely 1mpact ch1ldren from 
bnth to age 8, the1r fam1l1es, and the commun1t1es 1n whlch they l1ve, 1n order to glve every 
Mame chlld the r1ght start 1n l1fe, a safe and healthy env1romnent, nurture thelr early leannng, 
and enhance thelr well-be1ng 
Senate Pres1dent J ackson’s b1ll before you now, LD 1726, takes lmportant steps to make that 
m1ss1on a real1ty For the purposes on my testlmony, I am gomg to focus my remarks on the 
prov1s1ons 1n th1s b1ll that support the ch11d care workforce, whlch, as we all know, 1s the 
workforce beh1nd Ma1ne’s workforce 
I came to the pos1t1on as Chalr of the leg1slature ’s Ch1ldren ’s Caucus w1th very l1ttle background 
1n early chlldhood, other than be1ng a father of two chlldren It’s been a fascmatmg, and very 
t1mely, 1ssue area to d1ve 1nto 
Earl1er th1s year, the Ch1ldren ’s Caucus hosted a panel presentatlon of ch11d care workers, who 
shared w1th us the1r challenges, both dunng the pandem1c, and s1nce The Caucus hosteda 
s1m1lar panel three years ago My major take-away from these two S6SS1OI1S 1s that we, as 
pol1cymakers, have fa1led th1s cr1t1cal sector of Ma1ne’s economy 
Durmg the pandemlc ch1ld care workers were deemed essential —and they are Just l1ke ﬁrst 
responders and medlcal professlonals After all, ﬁrst responders and med1calprofess1onals and so 
many other Ma1ne workers needed ch1ld care workers to care for the1r ch1ldren so that they could 
do the1r own essent1al _]ObS 
When schools closed and parents needed to go to work, 1t was assumed that chlldren could Just 
go to ch1ld care programs No one asked about the programs ’ capac1ty, stafﬁng, ava1lab1l1ty or 
needs It was an assumpt1on —because the programs have always been there 
The ch1ld care 1ndustry answered the call They adjusted to the new world of COVID, w1th often- 
chang1ng and somet1mes conﬂ1ct1ng guldance, add1t1onal pressures, and even longer work days
Imtrally, there were no new resources to support them Many went1nto debt Some went 
unpald Yet, they were there to care for our ch1ldren —because that’s what they do and that’s 
what they love They felt an oblrgatlon to the chlldren 1n the1r care, and an obl1gat1on to those 
ch11dren ’s parents and fam111es 
The other speakers here today w11l share more deta11ed data on the low wages pald to Ma1ne 
chlld care workers Last year the Mame Leglslature and Governor M1lls took a sol1d ﬁrst step to 
address th1s lssue when we approved a $200 per month wage stlpend for ch1ld care 
provlders That moved the1r average hourly wage from $14 90 to $16 05 As I sa1d, 1t wasa 
good ﬁrst step But more needs to be done to help make ch1ld care providers ’ wages 
competrtlve Th1nk about how $16 05 per hour stacks up aga1nst pay for current entry-level _]0bS 
1n retall or restaurants I encourage you all to support the prov1s1on 1n LD 1726 Wh1Ch doubles 
the monthly wage supplement to $400 per month, whrch w1l1 then move the average hourly wage 
to $17 20 
On th1s po1nt I w111 Just add that, accordmg to a September 2021 report by the U S Treasury, 
child care, as a sector, is the second-lowest paid in our nation. 
Wlthout questlon, these past few years have made 1t undeniably clear how 1mportant ch1ld care 1s 
to the functronmg of our economy Parents have had to try to Juggle ch11d reanng and work 
slmultaneously whrle buslnesses came face-to-face wrth the reallty that, wrthout rellable chlld 
care, parents can’t work That connect1on between ch11d care and our economy makes addresslng 
parents’ barrlers to h1gh-qual1ty ch1ld care a pr1or1ty lssue for buslness leaders And 1t should be 
a pr1or1ty to all of us as pol1cymakers as well 
I want to thank Senate Presldent Jackson for champ1on1ng the 1ssue of mcreaslng wages for 
Ma1ne’s chlld care workers, as proposed 1n LD 1726 
If every famrly were able to access the quahty ch1ld care they need, regardless of where they 11ve 
1n Mame, we could mcrease workforce part1c1pat1on across the state and unleash great potentlal 
for economlc growth 
That’s how 1mportant th1s lnvestment 1s to chlldren, fam1l1es, the economy, and workforce 
attractlon Greater support for the frag1le Chlld care 1ndustry 1s the beg1nn1ng of a strateglc, 
targeted lnvestment 1n quallty early care and educatlon for Ma1ne’s youngest chrldren that W111 
shore up the foundatlon of our economy and pay d1v1dends for years to come Thank you
