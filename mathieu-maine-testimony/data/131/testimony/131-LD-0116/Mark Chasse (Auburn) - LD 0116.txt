LD 116 OUGHT-NOT-TO-PASS as wafe controls are regressive especially when you
consider new technologies are being developed i.e. robots and deployed BECAUSE 
when wages are artificially increased, in many cases results in Healthcare institutions 
staffing with fewer workers or implementing automation to decrease the need for 
workers.
Thank you.
