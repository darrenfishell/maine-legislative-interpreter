TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 1230  
 
RESOLVE, DIRECTING THE MAINE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM TO STUDY THE 
CREATION OF AN INTERSTATE COMPACT CONCERNING THE WINDFALL ELIMINATION 
PROVISION AND GOVERNMENT PENSION OFFSET  
 
Senator Tipping , Representa tive Roeder and members of the Labor and Housing  Committee.  I am Steven 
Bailey , executive directo r of Maine School Management A ssociation, testifying on behalf of the legislative 
committees of the Maine School  Boards Association and Maine School Super intendents Association , in 
support of  L.D. 1230 . 
 
We support the creation of a study group to investigate possible options to eliminate the current windfall 
provision for the Maine Public Employees Retirement System teacher members who have also worked in 
other position s covered by Social Security.  
 
Our goal is to allow our school district employees , who are members of the M ainePERS teacher retirement 
plan, to not be subject to the Social Security penalty for years that they have worked in a position where they 
contributed to Social Security and not to M ainePERS.  
 
We support this bill because our school district employees should be eligible to receive their earned  Social 
Security benefits without being penalized for work done as a MainePERS  covered employee .
