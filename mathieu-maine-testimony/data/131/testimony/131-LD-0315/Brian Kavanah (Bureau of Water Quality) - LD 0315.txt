Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the 
Committee, l am Brian Kavanah, Director of the Bureau of Water Quality at 
the Department of Environmental Protection. I am speaking in support of 
L.D. 315. 
As I noted during the Committee briefing on February 1, with Deputy 
Commissioner McBrady, regarding the legislative irrigation report required 
by L.D. 1998, the DEP interacts with farmers in various ways regarding 
irrigation. Most importantly, there are regulatory requirements for water 
withdrawals directly from surface waters. The DEP understands the 
importance of irrigation to Maine’s farmers. We are supportive of

L.D. 315 — 
An Act to Provide Funding for Drought Relief and other Programs Beneﬁtting Maine Farmers

assistance to farmers to help them develop irrigation ponds and wells to 
reduce direct withdrawals from surface waters which, during times of even 
moderate drought, will likely not have the capacity to support direct 
withdrawal for irrigation and still meet state water quality standards. 
Also, as outlined in the L.D. 1998 report, farmers could benefit froma 
variety of assistance services from DACF and DEP that the agencies do 
not now have the capacity to provide, particularly in Aroostook County 
which has historically been underserved. 
ln closing, enactment of L.D. 315 would fill this important gap in funding 
and services. l ask your support of L.D. 315 and I would be happy to 
answer any questions you have, now, or at the work session. 
Thank you.
