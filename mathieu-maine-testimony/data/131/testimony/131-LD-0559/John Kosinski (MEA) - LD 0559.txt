Testimony  
In Opposition  
LD 559: An Ac t to Increase the Number of Hours Certain Minor Students May Work Under 
Certain Circumstances   
John Kosinski, Government Relations Director, Maine Education Association  
Before the Labor and Housing Committee  
March  21, 2023  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and esteemed members of the Labor and Housing Committee,  
 
My name is John Kosinski (he/him) and I am proud to serve as the Director of Government Relations for 
the Maine Education Association (MEA).  The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, 
including teachers and other professionals in nearly ev ery public school in the state and faculty and other 
professional staff in the University of Maine and Community College Systems.  
 
I am here to testify on behalf of the MEA in opposition to LD 559, An Act to Increase the Number of 
Hours Certain Minor Stud ents May Work Under Certain Circumstances .   
 
This bill attempts to weaken Maine’s child labor laws by allowing students to work more hours even 
when school is in session.   
 
Put simply, we feel strongly students should focus on their education.  The educa tional foundation they 
build in high school will hopefully propel them to careers and further education and a lifetime of 
success.  We oppose efforts to allow students to work more hours when school is in session.  Regardless 
of the program, and even if th ey are engaged in home learning, we feel the focus of young people should 
be on learning and development.   
 
Under current law, minors aged 16 and 17 already can work up to 24 hours when school is in session 
and can even work until 10:15  pm on school night s.  As it is, what is currently allowed can make it 
difficult for students to have the energy needed to tend to their studies and stay focused in classes.  
I often tell my own children, “you have your whole life to be an adult.  Try to enjoy your childhood. ”  
We all appreciate hard  work and want to instill in all children a strong work ethic.  But these values are 
gained in many ways, not just working at a bowling alley or washing dishes in a kitchen.  Schools too try 
to instill these values in students, eve ry day.   
 
We are fully aware that some families rely on students working in order to make ends meet.  But there 
are better solutions to this problem, such as lifting the minimum wage or reinstating a child tax credit for 
parents of children.  If our goal is helping more families keep pace, we should do so by lifting wages for

working people and providing more support for struggling families, not lowering standards to allow 
children to work more hours.   
 
This proposal is not a solution to our current workforce shortages.  These shortages were at least partly 
due to the decisions of adults, and should not be used to allow more children to toil in service jobs for 
longer hours, rather than build relationships, play on a sports team, pick up a book, or ev en snap a friend.   
 
For these reasons, we oppose LD 559.  Thank you for your time and attention and service to the people 
of Maine.  I will do my best to answer any questions you may have.
