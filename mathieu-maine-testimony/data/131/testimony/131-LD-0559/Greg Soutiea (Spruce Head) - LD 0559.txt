LD 559
Greg and Lauren Soutiea, on behalf of the Craignair Inn and Causeway Restaurant 
would like to issue our support for LD 559. Over the past 3 years we have been able 
to utilize student help from our local community. Our student workers have been able 
to generate some income as well as learn skills that will benefit them in the future. 
Allowing an increase to the number of hours certain students may work would not 
only be a benefit to the students, but a major benefit to the employers in a time when 
finding help in the hospitality industry is so challenging. Thank you.
