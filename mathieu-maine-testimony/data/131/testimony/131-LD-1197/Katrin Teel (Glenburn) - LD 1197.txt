Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary:  
 
I am Katrin Teel of Glenburn, Maine. I am writing to testify in support of L.D. 1197, An Act to 
Prevent Coerced Abortion.  
 
This bill is a straightforward requirement for additional notice and information to be provided to 
any woman seeking an abortion, orally and in writing, in a language and manner that will be 
understood by the patient. This concept is not rocket science. Itâ€™s common sense with any 
serious medical procedure to have notice of rights and risks related to that procedure. As I am 
sure you would agree, informed consent is a right, not a privilege.  
 
Toward that end, I encourage you to vote Ought to Pass on L.D. 1197. Thank you for allowing 
me to contribute my testimony.
