Re: LD 1197 An Act To Prevent Coerced Abortion   
 
Members of the Committee on Judiciary, this is testimony AGAINST LD 1197.  
Coercion is the act of pressuring someone to do something against their will. Coercion regarding 
abortion can take many forms. LD 1197 seems to suggest that most abortion coercion happens in 
abortion clinics. Studies show this not to be the case. Most coercion happens in homes or within 
relationships, and women who reported coercion were most likely to say that financial concerns 
or relationship pressure were factors.  
 
There seems to be no evidence that abortion coercion is a prevalent issue within abortion clinics. 
In fact, professionals at these clinics have ethical and legal obligations to ensure that patients 
make informed decisions. LD 1197 therefore layers unnecessary and detailed legislation on top 
of an already delicate situation, and all that would accomplish is to leave opportunities for 
outside parties to push their own agenda into a situation already fraught with emotion.  
To effectively address the issue of abortion coercion, it is necessary to focus on education and 
support for those in these situations and work toward an environment where individuals can 
make informed decisions, without fear of coercion, concerning their reproductive health. This 
proposed law does not do that.  
Please vote ought not to pass on LD 1197.  
Sincerely, 
-Ray Vensel
