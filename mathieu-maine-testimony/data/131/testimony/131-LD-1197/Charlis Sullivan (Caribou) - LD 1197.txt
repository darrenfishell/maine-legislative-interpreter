Charlis Sullivan
Caribou
LD 1197
Representative Amy Arata and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary, my name is Charlis Sullivan and I am a resident of Caribou. I am here to
testify in support of LD1197, HP0757, An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion. I support
this bill to allow access to proper information in a manner that clearly helps the 
patient to understands options, procedures, and risks.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote “Ought to Pass” on this LD1197 which 
is designed to equitably disclose information to clients when faced with a life altering 
decision. Thank you.
