Dear Judiciary Committee,
Abortion is a heinous act.  To actively coerce a woman to kill her unborn baby is 
being an accessory to the child's death.  That we, in the state of Maine, even allow this
procedure is bad enough but to push a woman to do this doubles the evil of this 
practice.  Please give these innocent babies a chance to live, eliminate coercion but 
supporting this bill.
Thank you,
G. Frank and Susan R. Strickland
