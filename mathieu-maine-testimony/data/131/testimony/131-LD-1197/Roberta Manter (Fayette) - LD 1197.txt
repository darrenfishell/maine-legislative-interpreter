LD 1197
Please vote LD 1197 ought to pass.  Think about this: would you be in favor of a bill 
that said the opposite of this one?  That is, do you think anyone should have the right 
to coerce a women to have an abortion?  Anyone who opposes this bill is basically 
saying that they do not think a woman should be protected from anyone who wants to 
coerce her to have an abortion.  What does that tell you about the abortion industry?  
There are those who will testify that no abortion facility would ever coerce a woman 
to have an abortion, but that doesn't protect her from a man who does not wish to be 
held accountable for getting her pregnant.  But it is a well established principle in 
Maine law that, "It is not what has been done, or ordinarily would be done, under a 
statute, but what might be done under it, that determines whether it infringes upon the 
constitutional right of the citizen. The constitution guards against the chances of 
infringement. It is evident that under this statute the citizen might in some cases be 
practically deprived of all remedy." Bennett v. Davis (1897) 90 Me. 102, 105, 37 A. 
864, 865; Sleeper, Applt. (1952) 147 Me. 302, 308, 87 A.2d 115, Jordan v Canton 265
A.2d 96 (1970).  Without LD 1197, what "might be done" is that a woman could be 
coerced into having an abortion, depriving both her and her baby of their rights.  Why
do abortion clinics oppose this bill?  Do they want to protect irresponsible or violent 
men instead of protecting the women they claim to serve?  Do they really want to 
protect a woman's "right to choose?"  The word "choose" implies the ability to pick 
from various options.  A woman cannot "choose" if someone is coercing her into 
making the decision they advocate.  So if abortion clinics are really, truly in favor of a
woman's right to choose, they should also be supporting LD 1197.
