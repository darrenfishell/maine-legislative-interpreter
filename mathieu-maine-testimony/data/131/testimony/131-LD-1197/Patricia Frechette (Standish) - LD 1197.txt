Dear Committee Members:
No one should be coerced into doing something they do not want, especially abortion.
When you're pregnant, hormones kick in and could make one vulnerable to making a 
wrong decision.  Being coerced only puts more pressure on one's ability to think 
accordingly.  
I ask that you vote OUGHT to PASS on this bill.  Thank you.
