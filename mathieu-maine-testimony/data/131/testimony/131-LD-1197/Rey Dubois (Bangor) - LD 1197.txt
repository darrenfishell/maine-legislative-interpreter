Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen, and Members of the Jud1c1ary Commrttee, I 
am Rey Dubors, from Bangor, and I am speakrng 1n favor of LDs 494, 771, 1197, 1249, 
and l6l4 
I base my presentatron on what 1s FAIR and what 1s MORAL
3 
The Hyde Amendment l1m1ts Med1ca1d relmbursement for some abortron costs, and 1t 1s 
entrrely farr that the Hyde Amendment be enforced m Mame, hke 1t 1s m most other 
states Tax payers should not be forced to pay for the electlve procedures that are 
abortron, when they profoundly drsagree w1th abortron, the k1ll1ng of a pre-born chlld 
Our elderly , mtellectually drsabled, and homeless people need those tax dollars more 
than the 98% of women who become pregnant through therr own behavrors We 
taxpayers should not have to pay for the consequence of a man and a woman's 
consensual act that results 1n an unplanned pregnancy It's trme for them to pay for the 
result of therr own dec1s1ons 
An Act to Protect a Woman's Rrght to Wrthdraw Consent for an Abomon makes so much 
sense, that I'm even surpnsed to see that thrs leg1slat1on must be requtred as a law Don't 
we all agree that "NO" means "NO? " Shouldn't you be allowed to change your mmd, 
save a baby's hfe, and have your dec1s1on respected Pass LD 771 wrthout any hagglmg 
It makes so much sense 
LD ll97 rs smnlarly so strarght forward that 1t should pass wrthout resrstance It 1s _]11S'£ 
so FAIR that a woman should not be coerced mto krlhng her Child Aren't people always 
grven appropnate mformatron/educatron re elect1ve procedures 
LD 1249 restnct a Physrcran from prescrrbmg abortron through telehealth Wouldn't you 
M that an ethrcal medrcal pract1t1oner would want to do an actual face to face 
physrcal exam of a pregnant lady before domg somethmg so drastrc as ktll her ch1ld To 
abort a baby wrthout knowmg the correct fetal age, placenta locatron, or potentral 
presence of ectoprc pregnancy seem tantamount to malpractrce Isn‘t the health and 
safety of the mother supposed to be so rmportant? LD 1249 certarnly protects the health 
and safety of the mother more than ANY of the b1lls drscussed m hearmgs on Monday 
LD 1614 requrres that an ultrasound be completed and counsehng be prov1ded 
Approprrate dragnostrcs and full drscussron of safety and optrons seems hke somethmg a 
respectable practrtloner would provrde 
All of us testrfymg today are gomg to tell you these bllls ought to pass, and I recommend 
that you vote "Ought to pass" , but not Just because they mlght result m fewer babres 
bemg lulled Pass these b1lls because they'll result 1n the mothers bemg treated more 
safely and professronally, and the medrcal provrders w1llpract1ce therr trade m a more 
professronal manner
