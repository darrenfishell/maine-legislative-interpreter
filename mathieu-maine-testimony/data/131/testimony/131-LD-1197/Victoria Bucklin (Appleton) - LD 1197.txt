LD 1197
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary; my name is Victoria Bucklin and Iâ€™m a resident of 
Appleton. I am writing in support of LD 1197. 
I have heard from several women that when under economic distress, they went for 
welfare aid, they were bullied to get an abortion. The pressure to terminate the 
pregnancy was put on them every time they went for help. Abortion has become a 
significant money-generating industry in Maine and the US. We must do all that we 
can to protect both the pregnant woman and her unborn child. LD 1197 is a small step
in that direction.
