LD 1197
Hello, my name is Rob Poissant. I reside in the Town of Gorham. I support and urge 
you to support LD 1197. Mothers who are in a pregnancy are vulnerable and must be 
allowed to withdraw their consent for an Abortion before an abortion is performed on 
them.
In 2007 an ABC news story shared: “Homicide  is one of the leading causes of death 
for pregnant women in the US.”
Many minors with a pregnancy are coerced by a partner, parent , school authority or 
other to have an abortion against their will. A minor must have information and 
counseling to assist her  for her well-being. The minor must have the opportunity to 
have objective information conveyed to her that is not intended  to invite coercion. 
She must have the objective information given her by a health professional with 
respect to alternative choices which include : keeping the child; placing the child with
family foster care or adoption ;and the basics of prenatal / postnatal care. LD 1197 
would allow them to choose life for the unborn if they so choose.
