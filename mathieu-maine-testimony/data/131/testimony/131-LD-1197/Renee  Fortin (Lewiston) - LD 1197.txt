LD 1197
Sen Carney, Rep. Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Renee Fortin, I live in Lewiston
I am writing in support of LD 771, SP0330 An Act to Protect a Woman's Right to 
Withdraw Consent for an Abortion 
Summary:This bill establishes a pregnant woman's and a pregnant minor's right to 
withdraw the woman's or the minor's consent to an abortion at any time before the 
death of the fetus. The bill makes performing or aiding in the performance of an 
abortion after the pregnant woman or the pregnant minor has withdrawn consent a 
Class C crime.
Reason for Support: A woman should always have the right to change her mind about 
an abortion and if an abortion is performed after consent has been withdrawn, there 
must be criminal consequences.
I urge a vote in support of LD 771, "ought to pass"
