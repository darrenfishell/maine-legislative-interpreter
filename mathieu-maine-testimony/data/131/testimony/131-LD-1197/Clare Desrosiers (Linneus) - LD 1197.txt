LD 1197 - An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion
Position: Support
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Clare Desrosiers, from Linneus, ME. I am submitting testimony in 
Support of LD 1197.
The goals of this bill are to protect women by providing information and resources to 
empower them in making decisions. 
First, this bill is a straightforward requirement for additional notice and information to
be provided to any woman seeking an abortion. Itâ€™s common sense with any serious 
medical procedure to have notice of rights and risks related to that procedure. 
Second, women and teens seeking an abortion often are pressured to do so by family 
or domestic partners. This bill is important because it provides additional protections 
for women and teens which will protect them from being coerced or threatened into 
getting an abortion. It also ensures that women and teens are provided with resources 
to help them get out of unsafe relationships. Further, it ensures that businesses do not 
discriminate against women who are pregnant.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1197.
Thank you.
