Senator Carney, Representatwe Moonen, and members of the Jolnt standmg commlttee 
on J ud1c1ary, my name 1s Abb1e Strout-Bentes, I am the D1rector of Educat1on and 
Commun1ty Engagement at Mabel Wadsworth Center 1n Bangor Mabel Wadsworth 
Centerls the only mdependent, not-for-pro ﬁt, fem1n1st health center 1n Mame. We 
prov1de comprehens1ve sexual and I'€pI‘OCl11Cl1V € healthcare, mcludmg prenatal care, 
abortion care, blrth control, STD testmg and treatment, cancer screemngs, and other 
wellness care. 
I am here today on behalf of our health center to oppose all ﬁve b1lls be1ng heard th1s 
morn1ng.
Let’s be clear, the goal of these lI)1llS 1s to restr1ct access to abort1on care and are part of 
an overall strategy to ban abortlon. They are unnecessary and roll back lmportant 
changes that have made access to abort1on more equ1tab1e 1n Ma1ne 
The Supreme Court’s dec1s1on last June to overturn Roe v. Wade has ampl1ﬁed the 
d1spar1t1es 1n accessmg reproductwe health care 1n the Umted States P1’101‘ to that 
dec1s1on, lawmakers opposed to abortlon spent decades passlng state and federal 
leglslatlon, s1m1lar to the bllls presented today, that chlpped away access to abortlon. As 
a result, a pregnant person’s ab1l1ty to access the abortlon they need depends on where 
they l1ve and how much money or resources they have. 
At the same ume, 1n Mame, we have followed the clear support of our commumty 
members by not only protectmg access to abortlon but also pass1ng laws that expanded 
access to equltable care When I started at Mabel Wadsworth Center, a pregnant person 
had to travel to Portland, Augusta, or Bangor to access medlcatlon abortlon care, and 
most patlents had to pay out-of-pocket for the1r care. Now people hvmg 1n our most 
rural commun1t1es can access med1cat1on abortlon at the1r local famlly plannmg c11n1c or 
v1a telehealth w1th the p11ls malled to the1r homes w1th the care covered by the1r 
msurance. These changes have been cr1t1cal to ensurmg that every person 1n Mame has 
the ab1l1ty to make dec1s1ons about tl1e1r bodles and the1rl1ves 
Abort1on 1s a very common medlcal procedure and a normal part of reproductlve health 
11ves. One 1n four women w1ll have an abortlon by the tlme they turn 45 The sc1ence 1s 
clear' 1t 1s safe and l1fe-sav1ng medlcal care‘ . Addltlonally, access to abortlon allows 
people to bu1ld the fam1l1es they want and contrlbutes to a thr1v1ng commumty. Please 
do not roll back the progress we have made 1n Mame 
On behalf of Mabel Wadsworth Center, I urge you to oppose these b1lls. 
Thank you for your t1me.
