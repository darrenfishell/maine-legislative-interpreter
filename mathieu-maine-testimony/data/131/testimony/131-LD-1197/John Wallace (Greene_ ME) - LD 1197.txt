LD 1197
I support LD 1197. This bill prevents coerced abortion through a straightforward 
requirement for additional notice and information to be given to any woman seeking 
an abortion. Itâ€™s common sense with any serious medical procedure to have notice of 
rights and risks related to that procedure.
