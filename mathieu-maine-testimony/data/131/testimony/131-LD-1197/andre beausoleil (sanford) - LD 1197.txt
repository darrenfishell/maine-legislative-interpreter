LD1197  
I am writing today in support of LD 1197. 
Women have been lied to for as long as I can 
remember and thatâ€™s a long time now. Woman 
have been told that their baby was only a 
clump of cells and now we know that was a lie 
and is still being said to lie about. Every patient 
has a right to know they are being told the 
truth and not being lied to. It is now your 
responsibility to assure that they are not being 
lied to. They cannot be expected to make a life 
altering decision  without know they are getting 
the truth. Again I would like you to vote ought 
to pass on LD 1197 
Thank you
