                           BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
                                                                           Sponsored by : Rep. Amy Arata of New Gloucester 
                                                                         Public Hearing May 5, 2023 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary. 
My name is Andy Levesque I’m a resident of Gorham, a faithful Catholic, a member of the Knights of 
Columbus, and a board member of Maine Right to Life. 
So we meet again, after Mondays historic show of pro-life Mainers opposing LD1619 which would 
terminate the life of a newborn baby. 
I hope and pray that our sheer numbers will give you affirmation that the majority of Mainer’s do not 
support the Governor’s Bill to kill our newborns. 
Today I support LD494,771,1197,1249,1614 and 1809. 
This bill is a straightforward requirement for additional notice and information to be provided to any 
woman seeking an abortion. It’s common sense with any serious medical procedure to have notice of 
rights and risks related to that procedure. 
I urge you to vote for LD 1197, It’s the right thing to do.
