Senator
Anne
Carney ,
Representative
Matt
Moonen,
and
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
My
name
is
Cait
V aughan
and
I
am
a
staf f
member
with
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!),
an
education
and
advocacy
or ganization
dedicated
to
advancing
reproductive
health,
rights
and
justice
for
present
and
future
generations.
I’m
testifying
on
behalf
of
GRR!
in
opposition
to
LD
1 197:
An
Act
to
Pr event
Coer ced
Abortion.
The
assumption
that
medical
providers
are
coercing
patients
to
have
abortions
is
insulting
and
absurd.
Providers
are
already
highly
regulated
and
deeply
aware
of
both
their
hippocratic
oath
and
standards
of
care.
Studies
show
pregnant
folks
are
coerced
by
violent
partners
and
parents,
but
not
by
the
doctors
trained
to
support
their
health.
The
bill
“prohibits
criminal
threatening
of
any
person,
including
if
they
refuse
to
have
an
abortion.”
The
threatening
behavior
most
commonly
found
at
clinics
that
provide
abortions
are
by
protestors
who
are
opposed
to
patients’
legal
right
to
receive
care
without
harassment
or
interference.
The
implication
that
providers
push
abortions
onto
patients
is
legally ,
medically ,
and
morally
inaccurate.
The
inclusion
of
a
requirement
of
refunds
for
abortions
not
completed
is
bizarre
and
unnecessary .
Abortion
procedures
are
not
billed
until
after
the
completion
of
the
procedure.
So,
if
a
patient
schedules
and
then
cancels
an
appointment
for
an
abortion,
they
are
not
char ged
for
services
not
received.
Also,
when
a
patient
arrives
at
their
appointment
and
appears
to
be
in
conflict,
a
provider
will
of fer
to
reschedule
the
appointment
to
allow
for
more
consideration
and
refer
the
patient
to
additional
confidential,
unweighted
and
free
counseling.
Coercion
of
pregnant
people
to
have
abortions
is
most
often
perpetrated
by
parents
of
minors
and
partners
within
an
abusive
dynamic.
As
you
will
no
doubt
hear
in
testimony
by
the
Maine
Coalition
to
End
Domestic
V iolence
(MCEDV),
Maine’ s
public
abortion
providers
are
in
fact
excellent
resources
for
patients
in
unsafe
relationships
and
already
make
strong
referrals
to
social
services
and
victim
supports,
in
addition
to
maintaining
robust
professional
partnerships
and
or ganizational
connections
with
those
agencies.
GRR!s
want
pregnant
Mainers
to
feel
supported
and
safe,
and
LD
1 197
is
stigmatizing
providers
of
abortion
care
and
meaningful
referrals
to
critical
resources.
W e
ur ge
the
committee
to
oppose
LD
1 197.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration,
Cait
V aughan
&
GRR!s
across
Maine
