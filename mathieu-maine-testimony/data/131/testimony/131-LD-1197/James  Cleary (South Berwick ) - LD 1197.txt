LD 1197
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 1197.
It is 2023 and with the recent Dobbs decision, the issue of abortion is very much up 
for debate across the country. There is no federally recognized right to abortion, as the
Dobbs decision makes it clear that the previous Roe decision was deeply flawed.
There are many reasons why a woman or minor woman may feel that abortion is the 
only option. Having a child is a major life altering event. The promise of abortion as a
way to erase a mistake is unfortunately not the same as the reality. Abortion results in 
the death of the fetus. If and when a woman decides that she doesn't want to go 
through with the abortion, up to the point of the death of the fetus, she should have the
right to stop the process.
Just as having a child is a major life altering event, going through with an abortion 
can also result in lifelong regret. It is important that women not feel pressured into 
going through with an abortion just because money has been exchanged. Also a 
woman should be fully aware of her rights and the anti-descrimination protections 
afforded to her as a mother.
Please deem LD 1197 in “Ought To Pass” to ensure that women are able to make the 
last minute decision not to end a life. Thank you for your consideration.
