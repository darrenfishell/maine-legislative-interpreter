LD 1197
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to submit my testimony on LD 1197
I strongly support this bill.  There are so many good reasons why this bill should 
become law.  An unexpected pregnancy often causes panic and confusion in the 
person who finds herself pregnant and feels that she cannot afford a baby at that time 
in her life.  Informed consent should be both in writing and orally for better 
clarification and a chance to ask questions about the rights and risks related to the 
abortion procedure.
 If you purchase a product and decide you don't want it you can get a refund.  
Likewise, if you change your mind after having paid for an abortion, you should get a 
full refund of the amount you paid.  
I  like the fact that victims of domestic violence will be offered referrals to law 
enforcement agencies,and domestic violence and sexual assault support organizations.
LD 1197 is such a good all encompassing bill that I don't see why anyone would 
oppose it.
As I said at the beginning, I strongly support this bill and ask that you will support it 
also.  Please vote ought to pass on LD 1197.
