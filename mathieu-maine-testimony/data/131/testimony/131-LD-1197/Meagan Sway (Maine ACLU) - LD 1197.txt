TESTIMONY OF MEAGAN SWAY, ESQ 
Ought Not To Pass 
LD 1197 — An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion 
J o1nt Standlng Comm1ttee on Jud1c1ary 
May 5, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representatwe Moonen and d1st1ngu1shed members of the J o1nt 
Stand1ng Commlttee on Jud1c1ary, greetmgs My name 1s Meagan Sway, and I am 
pol1cy d1rector of the Amerlcan C1v1l L1bert1es Un1on of Mame, a statew1de 
organ1zat1on comm1tted to advanc1ng and preservmg c1v1l l1bert1es guaranteed by 
the Mame and U S Const1tut1ons On behalf of our members, I am here to test1fy 
aga1nst LD 1197 
Th1s leg1slat1on 1s based on a m1sunderstand1ng of how med1cal procedures and 
mformed consent relatlng to med1cal procedures work F1rst, pat1ents are already 
able to change the1r mlnds at any po1nt before any med1cal procedure beg1ns 
Abort1on, as a med1cal procedure, 1s no d1fferent from other procedures thata 
pat1ent may declde not to undertake The ab1l1ty to change one’s m1nd about 
whether or not to undergo a med1cal procedure and recelve a refund 1f a person does 
change the1r m1nd, should be the same for all med1cal procedures Imposlng 
dlfferent rules for abortlon st1gmat1zes abortlon as a form of health care 
The leg1slat1on also would compel the Mame Human Rlghts Commlsslon and 
med1cal prov1ders to dlscuss legal concepts such as d1scr1m1nat1on w1th the1r 
pat1ents Wh1le we support everyone 1n Mame knowmg the1r r1ghts, th1s b1ll 
approaches a l1ne of asklng med1cal prov1ders to prov1de legal adv1ce The 
unauthor1zed practlce of law 1s a compl1cated concept that fouls up lawyers 
themselves, let alone med1cal prov1ders who have not gone to law school 
D1scuss1ons between pat1ents and the1r health care prov1ders sh' ou1d center on the1r 
health care opt1ons, not the1r legal ones 
Because th1s b1ll 1s a solut1on 1n search of a problem, we urge you to vote ought not 
to pass
