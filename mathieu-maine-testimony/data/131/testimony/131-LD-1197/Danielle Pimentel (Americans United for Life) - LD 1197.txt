Policy  Counsel,  Americans  United  for Life  
In Support  of L.D.  1197 
Submitted  to the Joint  Judiciary  Committee  
May  5, 2023   
 
Dear Chair Carney , Chair  Moonen , and Members of the Committee:  
My Name is Danielle Pimentel, and I serve as Policy Counsel at Americans United for 
Life (“AUL”). Established in 1971, AUL is a national law and policy nonprofit organization 
with a specialization in abortion, end-of-life issues, and bioethics law. AUL publishes pro -life 
model legislation and policy guides,1 tracks state bioethics legislation,2 and regularly testifies 
on pro -life legislation in Congress and the States. Our vision at  AUL is to strive for a world 
where everyone is welcomed in life and protected in law. As Policy Counsel, I specialize in 
life-related legislation, constitutional law, and abortion jurisprudence.  
Thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony i n support of LD 1197 , 
(“LD 1197 ” or “bill”) . I ha ve thoroughly examined LD 1197  and I urge the Committee to 
support this bill because it ensures that women receive  the information necessary to make 
informed, voluntary decisions regarding their pregnancies,  and furthers Maine ’s legitimate 
interest t o protect  the maternal health and safety  of its citizens.  
I. The Bill Ensures  that  the Women  of Maine  are Protected  Against  Coerced  Abortions   
LD 1197  ensures that women are adequately informed of the legal protections  against 
coercive abuse and that they may access abuse victim  resources prior to obtaining an 
abortion . Specifically, the bill  requires health care professional s and counselors to inform 
adult women and minors who are seeking an abortion of the following information: 1) a

 woman may withhold or withdraw her consent to have an abortion and receive a refund for 
any payments made  to wards the abortion; 2) the woman’s decision to not have an abortion 
will not affect her right to receive public assistance or public health services; 3) Maine law 
prohibits the criminal threatening of any  woman who refuses to have an abortion ; 4) the 
contact information for providers of resources for victims of domestic abuse, including the 
number of at least one domestic violence hotline and one sexual assault hotline ; and 5) that 
the Maine Human Rights Act protects against discrimination on the b asis of a woman’s 
pregnancy.   The abortion provider must also offer to provide referrals to law enforcement 
agencies and domestic violence and sexual assault support organizations and  offer to call a 
law enforcement agency if the woman or minor feels that they would be unsafe if they refuse 
to have an abortion.  
It’s pertinent that abortion providers  inform women of these resources and legal 
protections prior to an abortion because  many women are forced to have an abortion due to 
intimate partner violence (“IPV”) or reproductive control  from an  intimate partner, family 
member, employer , or sex -trafficker .3 In fact, i n a 2017 study  on women’s abortion 
experiences , 73.8% of women  said that they “disagreed that their decision to abort was 
entirely free from even subtle pressure from others to abort,” and 28.4% of women said that 
they “aborted out of fear of losing their partner if they did not abort.”4 Additionally, in a 2023 
natio nal study published in Cureus medical journal, researchers f ound that over 60% of 
women who had abortions reported experiencing high levels of pressure to abort from one

 or more sources.5 These women also reported having higher levels of mental health iss ues 
after having an abortion.6 
The findings of these studies are not surprising given that w omen who experience 
IPV may be su bject to physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, and psychological 
aggression by a current or former intimate partner.7 There are “[h]igh rates of physical, 
sexual, and emotional IPV ” among women seeking  an abortion.”8 For example, the  
prevalence of IPV for women seeking an abortion is nearly three times greater than a woman 
continuing a pregnancy .9 IPV victims who do obtain abortions also have “significant 
association” with “psychosocial problems including depression, suicidal ideation, stress, and 
disturbing thoughts.”10 
Similarly, “[a]s many as one -quarter of women of reproductive age attending fo r 
sexual and reproductive health services give a history of ever having suffered [reproductive 
control].”11 Reproductive control occurs over “decisions around whether or not to start, 
continue or terminate a pregnancy, including deployment of contraception , and may be 
exercised at various times in relation to intercourse, conception gestation, and delivery.”12  
Victims of sex -trafficking are among the  number of  women who experience 
reproductive control.  A 2014 study on the health consequences for sex-trafficking victims  
found that  66 sex -trafficking victims had a total of 114 abortions, “[w]ithout accounting for 
possible underreporting.”13 “The [sex -trafficking] survivors in this study [] reported that 
they often did not freely choose the abortions  they had while being trafficked.”14 A majority  
of the 66 sex -trafficking victims “indicated that one or more of their abortions was at least 
partly forced upon them.”15 Given the prevalence of coerced abortions among  sex-trafficking 
victims , the authors of the  2014  study noted that “[h]ealthcare providers can play a crucial 
role in the trafficking rescue process by identifying possible victims and following up on 
those suspicions  with careful, strategic questions, and actions that catalyze rescue or help 
create exit strategies.”16 
This bill would ensure that abortion  providers in Maine  take the necessary steps to 
protect the health and safety of women and young girls  that enter their abortion clinics . By

 providing women with information on the essential resources and assistance available to 
them , abortion providers will be able to identify victims of sex -trafficking and domestic 
abuse and  can help  “catalyze rescue or help create exit strategies” fo r these women .17 
Additionally, the bill ensures that women know that they have the right to withdraw their 
consent to have an abortion any time before the abortion is performed, which is especially 
important given the prevalence of coerced abortions.  In effect, this bill will not only protec t 
against coerced abortions , but it will also help increase the number of women and young 
girls  rescued from  abusive situations.   
II. Maine  Has Broad  Powers  to Enact  Protections  that  Ensure  the Health  and Safety  of 
Pregnan t Women  
This  Committee can further Maine ’s legitimate interest in protecting  the maternal 
health and safety  of its citizens by voting in support of LD 1197 . In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization , the United States Supreme Court found that “States may regulate 
abortion for legitimate reasons” if the law is rationally related to those reasons.18 The 
Supreme Court  also  held that a State has a legitimate interest in “the protection of maternal 
health and safety.”19 Accordingly, Maine  has broad powers to pass protections  like LD 1197  
that ensure the health and safety of pregnant woman . 
Notably, at least 24 other  states cu rrently have some form of coercive abuse 
prevention law: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho,  Indiana,  Kansas, 
Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin.20 By enacting LD 1197 , Maine  will be joining numerous states that hav e 
recognized the need to implement safeguards to protect women and young girls from being 
coerc ed by partners, family members, employers, or sex traffickers.  
III. Conclusion  
For these reasons, I strongly encourage the members of this Committee to support LD 
1197  and continue to uphold Maine ’s duty to protect the health and safety of pregnant 
women .
