LD 1197 HPO7 Act to Prevent Coerced Abortlon 57 An 
Support 
Senator Carney, Representative l\/loonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee My name is Karen 
Vachon I am the Executive Director of Maine Right To Life, in Auburn, and a resident of Scarborough l 
come before you today to speak in support LD 119/ 
Maine Right to Life is a state affiliate of the National Right To Life Committee We are a non-profit 
organization founded to protect and uphold the dignity and worth of every human life from conception to 
natural death by making abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia socially, ethically, and legally unacceptable 
and to actively promote positive alternatives 
We are Pro-Life, Pro-Active, and Pro-Women Our members share a belief that women were created 
uniquely to fulﬁll a very important role in mankind Women have a womb They bring new life into the 
world They are to be honored, respected, and protected The word, "reproductive" means to produce 
an offspring 
Thank Representative Amy Arata for sponsoring this bill Studies have shown that 64% of women report 
being pressured to have an db0lLlOH Other research reported dial 45% of rnen interviewed at an 
abortion facility admitted they urged their partners to have an abortion A Norway study looking at post- 
abortive women found that “the strongest predictor of [post-abortion] emotional distress was ”pressure 
from the male partner” The study concludes that coerced women, in the two years following their 
abortion, are the group most likely to suffer post~abortion trauma1 
Women have been sold by the Pro-Abortion industry that abortion is liberating, empowering, and freeing 
Nothing could be further from the truth There are countless stories of women who were coerced into 
having an abortion They suffer in silence The pro-abortion lobby buries studies of post-abortive women 
who suffer great remorse 
When women finally have the courage to grieve and heal from the trauma of their own abortion, we hear 
their stories Members of this committee may discount this as anecdotal l believe there lS a correlation 
to young teeri's high rate of depression, suicide, di ug overdose deaths, and hormcides committed against 
pregnant women 
l think it's time to connect the dots and protect and support women Women deserve better and Maine 
deserves better Please vote ought-to-pass on this legislation Thank you
