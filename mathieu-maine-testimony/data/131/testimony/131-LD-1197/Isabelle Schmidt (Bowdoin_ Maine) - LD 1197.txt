LD 1197
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
My name is Isabelle Schmidt, from Bowdoin. 
I am writing to speak in support of LD 1197, “An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion.”  
In order to qualify as true health care, medical professionals ought always to inform 
anyone, in writing and orally, about everything possibly related to their personal 
health condition, including their legal rights considering this condition.  Pregnant 
women ought never to be the exception to this. 
Within this bill, many requirements, regarding medical professionals serving pregnant
women, are thoughtfully provided in order to more properly safeguard a woman’s 
well-being.  Whatever the nature of the initial help sought out by the pregnant 
woman, a position of clear, sincere and thoroughly informed professional counsel and
concerned  assessment is the best response to the patient preceding her ultimate 
decision concerning the child.  
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 1197.  Thank you.
