Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary.  My name is Jon Schmidt, I am a resident of Bowdoin, and I am 
submitting this testimony to express my SUPPORT for LD 1197.. 
I support LD 1197 because its provisions, in combination with several other pro-life bills 
currently under consideration, will help to restore common sense safeguards and necessary 
restraint to Maineâ€™s permissive abortion laws.   
A woman must be informed very clearly of her right NOT to abort her unborn child, including 
her right to withdraw a previous decision to do so, without fear of  monetary loss (to an 
abortion provider) or coercion from domestic partners or other influencers.   
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS.. Thank you.
