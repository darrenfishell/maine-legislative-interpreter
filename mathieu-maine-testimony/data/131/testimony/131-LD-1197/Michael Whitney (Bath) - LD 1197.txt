To: The Judiciary Committee 
 
I am writing to urge you to vote “ought to pass” LD1197 for these reasons: 
 
1. The law prohibits criminal threatening of any person, including a person who 
refuses to have an abortion. 
2. Any patient, and especially a minor, has the right to withdraw consent for an 
abortion at any time before the procedure is performed, and to receive a full 
refund. 
3. This bill (LD1197) is a common sense requirement for notice and information to 
be provided any woman seeking an abortion of the risks and rights that are hers. 
 
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD1197. 
Thank you!
