The most widely accepted definition of abortion involves the ending of human life. 
As a Christian, I believe it is my duty to stand for those who are defenseless and have 
no voice and that the ending of their life is morally wrong. I believe any measure to 
allow a woman to decide for herself to protect her child should be supported by Law.
