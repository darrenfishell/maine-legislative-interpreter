Testimony in Support of LD 1197 
“An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion ” 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and d1st1ngu1shed members of the Jud1c1ary 
Commlttee, my name 1s Amy Arata, I am from New Gloucester, and I am pleased to present to 
LD 1197, “An Act to Prevent Coerced Abort1on” 
Th1s b1ll amends the laws govermng mformed consent to abortlon Pnor to an abortron, a pat1ent 
must be prov1ded vanous drsclosures, orally and 1n wntmg and n1 a language and marmer that 
W111 be understood by the pat1ent In l1ght of the many 1rn1n1grants We are welcommg mto Mame 
from all over the world, 1t’s partrcularly nnportant that everybody can understand exactly what 
thelr nghts are The d1sclosures mclude the followmg 
Number 1 Not1ce that she has the nght to wlthdraw consent for an abortron at any tlme before 
the performance of the abortlon and, 1f so, to recelve a reﬁmd of any payments made to the 
health care professronal for the performance of the abortlon Tlus part of the b1l1 was mspired by 
the story told by M1ssour1 Democratrc Congresswoman Con Bush, who repeatedly sa1d “no” 
durmg an abort1on and was lgnored As a mother, I can lmagme many reasons why a woman 
would change her m1nd at the last rnmute Perhaps she _]11S11 felt the baby move, and came to the 
reahzatlon that th1s so-called “fetus” 1s a separate, precrous human bemg, whose hfe 1s valuable, 
Just hke your l1ves are preclous and valuable 
Number 2 Before an abortlon, she must rece1ve notlce that the law proh1b1ts cnrnmal threatemng 
of any person, mcludmg a person who refuses to have an abo1t1on For Example, N1Cl’1Ol3.S and 
Lola Kampf of North Yarmouth chased then 19-year-old daughter, t1ed her hands and tned to 
force her to get an abort1on after they found out she was pregnant Wlth a black man’s baby 
Number 3 She must be glven the telephone number of at least one domestlc v1olence hothne and 
one sexual assault hotlme, and an offer to make referrals to law enforcement agenc1es and 
domesuc v1olence and sexual assault support orgamzatlons, and an oﬁer to call law enforcement 
1f she feels that she w1ll be unsafe 1f she refuses to have an abortron It’s a sad fact that some 
women are threatened w1th vlolence for refusmg an abortron, and may feel they have no other 
cho1ce Ifthls b1ll passes, she’ll know that she has other cho1ces
“\
Number 4 Informatron regardmg the Mame Human R1ghts Act's protectlons agamst 
d1scr1mmat1on m employment, educatron and housmg on the basls of pregnancy or famlhal status 
and, upon request, educatronal matenals prepared by the Mame Human Rlghts Comnussron 
regardmg these protectlons As a housmg provrder, I’ve had prospectrve tenants tell me that then 
landlord has told them to move because of havmg a baby, and I’ve also had tenants ask me 1fI 
would force them to move 1f they had a baby Thls 1s absolutely rllegal m Mame, and, agam, 
women shouldn’t feel that they have no chorce other than abortlon m order to keep lll161l‘_]ObS, 
housmg, or to pursue an educatlon 
Number 5 I am requestmg an amendment to the b1ll to requne drsclosure of any past 1I1_]1JI18S or 
deaths of the abortron prov1der ’s pat1ents I was smpnsed to ﬁnd that physrcrans wrth a hrstory 
of performmg abortrons when women d16Cl are allowed to practrce med1c1ne 1n Mame I reallzed 
tlns after Dr Shannon L Carr, talked about performmg late-term abort1ons m Mame, after 
havmg performed an abortron 1n New Mex1co that resulted 1n her pat1ent’s death Women 
deserve to know the nsks of abo1t1on \ 
Thank you and I’m happy to answer questrons 
Respectfully, 
Amy Arata
