Janet LeBlanc
Waterville
LD 1197
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Janet LeBlanc and I am a resident of 
Waterville. I am  testifying in support of LD 1197.
Women will be empowered by the passing of LD 1197.   It ensures pregnant women 
and pregnant minors are provided with all of the information they need to face their 
fears of being coerced into having an abortion.  
This bill requires providers to provide information in writing and orally in a language 
the patient understands and in a manner the person understands.  Ensuring pregnant 
women understand they have a right to withdraw consent for an abortion at any time 
and will receive a refund for the abortion not performed dis extremely important.
LD 1197, empowers women by requiring providers to inform them that the law 
prohibits criminal threatening of any person, including a person who refuses to have 
an abortion.  It also requires women to have contact information for providers of 
resources for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and much more. 
This bill empowers women by requiring providers to inform women of the Maine 
Human Rights Actâ€™s protections against discrimination.  
Women have a right to be given the information they need to empower them and 
allow them not to be victims.
