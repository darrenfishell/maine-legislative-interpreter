Maine Family Planning 
Testimony in Opposition to 
LD 1197, LD 494, LD 771, LD 1249, and LD 1614 
May S, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Laura Harper and I am testifying today on behalf of my client, Maine Family Planning 
It is unconscionable that we are facing more than half a dozen anti-abortion bills this session Post-Dobbs, 
approximately 22 million women and girls of reproductive age in the US now live in states where abortion access is 
heavily restricted and often totally inaccessible These bans and restrictions fall hardest on Black, Indigenous, Latina, 
and immigrant women, further harming their reproductive health at a time when we are facing a maternal mortality 
crisis in this country It is immoral and outrageous that in this moment of crisis, some Maine legislators are bringing 
forward bills that would stigmatize and restrict access to this essential reproductive health care 
In the words of Dr Ana Langer, a physician specializing in pediatrics and neonatology and leader of the 
Women and Health Initiative at Harvard's T H Chan School of Public Health, "Numerous international and regional 
human rights treaties and national-level constitutions around the world protect the right to safe and legal abortion as 
a fundamental human right Access to safe abortion is included in a constellation of rights, including the rights to lrfe, 
liberty, privacy, equality and non-discrimination, and freedom from cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment" 
The bills we are testifying against today are not grounded in evidence-based medicine or science They are 
not concerned with the lives of pregnant people and their families Their 0bjECtlVe is to limit access to abortion And 
restricting access to abortion denies people the human right to bodlly autonomy, traps people in poverty, and 
perpetuates cycles of abuse and violence against women 
The decision of whether to continue a pregnancy is deeply personal Many factors contribute to people's 
decisions, including financial, social, and health conditions, as well as individual belief systems The only role that the 
state should have in these deeply personal decisions is protecting an individual's right to make them, and ensuring 
meaningful support for whatever decision they make, whether that's abortion or birth, adoption or parenting 
On behalf of the reproductive health experts at Maine Family Planning, I urge you to |"6jECt LD 1197, LD 494,
