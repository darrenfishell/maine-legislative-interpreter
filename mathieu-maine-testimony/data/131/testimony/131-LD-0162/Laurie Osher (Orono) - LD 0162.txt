T estimony

Representative
Laurie
Osher
introducing
LD
162:
An
Act
to
Establish
a
Substance
Use
Disorder
Hotline
and
Consultation
and
Clinical
Supervision
Before
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services
Committee.
I
am
Laurie
Osher
and
I
represent
District
25,
the
majority
of
Orono.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
introduce
and
express
my
support
for
LD
162:
An
Act
to
Establish
a
Substance
Use
Disorder
Hotline
and
Consultation
and
Clinical
Supervision.
Maine
has
a
lot
of
people
suffering
from
substance
abuse
disorder ,
and
even
more
people
who
are
pained
and
bereft
because
they
have
a
family
member
struggling
with
substance
abuse
disorder .
If
the
person
with
substance
abuse
disorder
has
health
care,
their
first
step
to
addressing
their
illness
is
to
talk
with
their
primary
care
provider .
That
primary
care
provider
would
refer
the
person
with
SUD
to
a
SUD
specialist.
However ,
Maine
has
too
few
places
for
PCPs
to
refer
their
patients
for
care,
and
those
places
have
excruciatingly
long
waitlists.
So,
the
person
with
SUD
gets
their
medical
care
from
their
PCP.
This
is
occuring
all
across
the
state;
Mainers
with
SUD
are
being
cared
for
by
people
who
are
not
specialists
in
substance
abuse
disorder .
Where
can
the
PCP
go
to
get
help?
This
bill
proposes
to
set
up
a
hotline
so
that
primary
care
providers
can
have
a
place
to
call
to
ask
questions
or
consult
with
a
specialist
in
SUD.
The
hotline
will
be
for
all
SUDs,
not
just
for
opiate
use
disorder .
The
people
staffing
the
hotline
can
help
with
making
referrals,
engaging
family
and
others,
and
managing
the
physical
problems
associated
with
substance
use.
The
bill
also
proposes
to
create
ongoing
clinical
supervision/consultation
groups
for
primary
care
providers.
The
goal
is
to
help
PCPs
gain
knowledge
and
serve
their
patients
better .
Their
goal
and
ours
is
to
save
lives.
And,
why
am
I
submitting
testimony
on
this
bill?
It
is
because
our
state
is
in
crisis,
and
when
there
is
a
crisis,
I
do
my
part
to
support
those
who
are
working
to
save
lives.
I
urge
you
to
join
me
in
supporting
this
bill
so
that
we
can
support
physicians
and
have
better
outcomes
for
people
with
substance
use
disorder .
