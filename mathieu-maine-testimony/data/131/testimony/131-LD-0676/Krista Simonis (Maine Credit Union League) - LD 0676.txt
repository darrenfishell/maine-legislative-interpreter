My name is Kr-ista Simonis and I serve as the Director of Governmental -Affairs at the Maine 
Credit Union_Leag ‘ ue. _' 
The League proudly represents all or Maine's 50 credityunions totaling A -- 
'more _than'$11~bil| ‘ion inl assets and ove_ r'725,000,members statewide. Please accept our 7‘ 
testimony in opposition to LD 676; An Act to Protect Financial Privacy. . ‘' 
y I' 
While the aims of LD _676.are admirable, the reality is that this legislation could threaten the 
ability of "Maine's finan_ cial_i_nstitutions to legally operate in this state. Federally chartered credit 
unions would not be able tocomply with LD 676 and remain operational, as their regulatory -
j 
'o'versi'ght_is by federal g‘overn_ment. Maine law requires ‘ member accounts to‘ be federallyA 
insured. As" pa»rt.of ”that insurance, credit unions are subject to federal oversight by the National . 
Cr_edit' Union Adm _inistr_ation (NCUA).'
. 
g _. 
LD_676 _ would have the y most direct impact on our state-chartered credit unions. 12 of Maine's 
5'(_)' .cre'dit' unions are state chartered, representing more than 225,000 members. This legislation 
would impact the abi-lity of state-cha rtered‘ creditunions to share data with their federal' -" 
regulators, threatening the ability of-state-cha rtered credit unions » to maintain NCUA share 
insurance. _-

lnsaddition to threatening the ability of financial institutions to operate in Maine, LD 676 would 
create regula' tory‘ uncertainty. Since currentlaw protects against the sharing of financial records 
.(inclusive~of'the_federa|,government), the addition of Section 2 in the proposed legislation 
,co'uld' _e:x' pose consumers andfiinancial institutions to more requestslfor financial records. , 
Protecting members’ privacy is of the utmost concern to all Maine credit unions. At the federal 
'level,_the Gramm-l.each-Bl_il_ey Act requires that financial records be kept confidential unless . 
required to maintain federal insurance, ‘prevent moneyylaundel ringand counter terrorism, or 
protect vulnerable comm,unjty"members. . 
_- 
_'
_ 
Aspart of our commitment to safeguarding member data, we've fought against any expansion 
of federal data sharing. A proposal considered during the last Congress contained a provision to
require financial institutions to disclose to the internal Revenue Service (IRS) any transaction'
y 
over $600. Thanks in part to united opposition from financial institutions, including credit 
unions, this provision was not enacted. - V 
_’ 
Making sure members have trusted financial partners that protect their information from .6 
fraudsters, third party institutions, or government overreach is of paramount importancein A' 
building and maintaining trust with ourmembers. We are already providing the financial .- ' ' 
privacy this bill attempts to ensure. Maine's credit unions care deeply about theirrnembers and 
that extends to our commitment to privacy. LD 676 would not further protect Mainers and j; ' ' 
would instead threaten the ability of financial institutions to operate in this state.‘i

Thank you for your time and consideration. We respectfully urge the committee to vote _Ought _ Ll 
Not To Pass on LD 676. -
