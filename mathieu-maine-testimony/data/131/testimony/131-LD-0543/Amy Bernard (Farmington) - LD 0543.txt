Amy Bernard, Franklin Count Administrator for the Hearing on March 8, 2023 at 1:00p.m. Per MRS Title 
4 § 115 PLACE FOR HOLDING COURT; SUITABLE QUARTERS, Franklin County is required to provide space 
for use by the Superior Court in the County Courthouse, as designated by the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Judicial Court or their designee. In Franklin County this space is most of our third floor.  
Franklin County has never, to my knowledge, had a lease with Maine Superior Court. We have provided 
nearly 4000 square feet of space for use by Maine Superior Court since January 1, 1976. At one time the 
County received $2500 to help defray the costs of the space, but the county has not received any funds 
for the use of the space in the last 5 years.
After conversations with the other County Administrators, it is evident that the “rent” for the Supreme 
Judicial Court is NOT consistent in any manner. Franklin County receives no funding while other Counties 
are receiving finds to cover costs. The Clerk of the Court will send the County a schedule that at many 
times consumes at least half, if not more, of the weekdays in a month. In addition, they have informed 
us that we should let them know when we intend to be using the space, as they allow outside entities to 
use this space. Franklin County is requesting compensation for the space the Court uses here, as 
Superior Court “uses” this space about 50% of the time and isn’t financially supporting the cost of 
operating the space. I state “uses” loosely, as often they do not show up for court and the Clerk rarely 
emails or informs the County of the change in schedule. We we are looking for a establish an agreement 
with the State Superior Court that is fair and equitable for all Counties.
