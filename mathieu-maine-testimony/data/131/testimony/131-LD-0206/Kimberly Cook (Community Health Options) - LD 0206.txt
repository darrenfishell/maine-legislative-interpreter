As Maine’s only nonprofit CO -OP health insurance company,  Community Health Options is  
pleased to present this testimony in support of the Governor’s Supplemental Budget , specifically 
the extension of  the Small Business Health Insurance Premium Relief Program through  the end 
of 2023.  
With more than 1,200 small businesses among our membership, and having started as a small 
business ourselves, we know of the challenges of running a small business.  Asid e from  our four 
percent average decrease  in small group premiums in 2023, the cost of coverage has taken an 
increasing slice of the budgets of small businesses  over the past decade.  Now with some market 
indicators pointing to a slowdown in the economy, th is ongoing relief , which is applied wholly 
and directly to reduce the costs borne by employers and employees , is an efficient and effective 
economic shot in the arm.   
In today’s tight labor market, many employers have had difficulty recruiting and retaini ng staff.  
One avenue for small businesses to attract and keep talent is through competitive benefits 
packages.  Some small businesses are utilizing the savings through the health insurance premium 
relief program to provide additional forms of coverage and  voluntary benefits.  Extending the 
Small Business Health Insurance Premium Relief Program  provides a much -needed economic 
boost at a time of great uncertainty.   
We urge the Committee to support section  C-5 of the Supplemental Budget, LD 206 .  Thank you 
for the opportunity  to present our support  of the program .
