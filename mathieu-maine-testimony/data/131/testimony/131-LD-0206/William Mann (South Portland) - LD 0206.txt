Testimony in opposition to Part C of LD 206, HP127, An Act to Make Supplemental 
Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund and Other Funds for the 
Expenditures of State Government and to Change Certain Provisions of the Law Necessary 
to the Proper Operations of State Government f or the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2023 
Senators Rotundo and Chipman, Representative Sachs and Williams, and distinguished members 
of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Taxation:  
I join you today to testify on behalf of the City of South Portland in opposition to Part C of LD 
206, HP127, An Act to Make Supplemental Appropriations and Allocations from the General 
Fund and Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and to Change Certain 
Provisions of the Law Ne cessary to the Proper Operations of State Government for the Fiscal 
Year Ending June 30, 2023. 
Section C of LD 206 proposes to re -allocate $10,000,000 that was originally allocated to 
rehabilitate Portland Harbor’s working waterfront and sustain an estimat ed $1  billion  in 
economic activity. This regional project would see Portland Harbor dredged for the first time in 
decades to protect the berthing that waterfront industries and vessels need to operate, as well as the construction of a Confined Aquatic Disposal ce ll to responsibly store the contaminated 
sediment.     
Dredging will stabilize losses and expand the potential of the harbor for fisheries, tourism, 
aquaculture, and emerging opportunities in the local, regional, and state “Blue Economy.”    
I strongly urge the Committee to leave in place the allocation of $10,000,000 to rehabilitate / 
dredge piers, wharfs, and berthing space along Portland Harbor’s working waterfronts . This 

allocation will h elp sustain the af orementioned $1 billion in estimated annual economic activity 
on one of the most important ports in the s tate. I resp ectfully ask  that you vote to oppose the 
above -referenced reallocation of these funds . 
Respectfully Submitted,  
Kate Lewis, Mayor  
City of South Portland
