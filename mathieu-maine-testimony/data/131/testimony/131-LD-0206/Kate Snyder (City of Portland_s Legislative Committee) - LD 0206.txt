Senators Rotundo and Chipman, Representative Sachs and Williams, and distinguished
members of the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and
Taxation:
I join you today to testify on behalf of the City of Portland in opposition to Part C of LD 206,
HP127, An Act to Make Supplemental Appropriations and Allocations from the General Fund
and Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government and to Change Certain Provisions
of the Law Necessary to the Proper Operations of State Government for the Fiscal Year Ending
June 30, 2023.
Section C of LD 206 proposes to re-allocate $10,000,000 that was originally allocated to
rehabilitate Portland Harbor ’s working waterfront and sustain an estimated $1B in economic
activity . This project would see Portland Harbor dredged for the first time in over 70 years to
protect the berthing that waterfront industries need to operate, as well as the construction of a
Confined Aquatic Disposal cell to responsibly store the contaminated sediment.
Dredging will stabilize losses and expand the potential of the harbor for fisheries, tourism,
aquaculture, and emer ging opportunities in the local, regional, and state “Blue Economy .”  

The project would benefit 30 private commercial properties, directly supporting dozens of
businesses, hundreds of jobs, thousands of vessels, and millions of dollars in annual economic
activity for decades to come.
The City of Portland ur ges you not to re-allocate the $10,000,000 originally allocated for these
purposes, which are vital to not just the City of Portland’ s economic future, but also the region
and State’ s.
Thank you for your consideration.
