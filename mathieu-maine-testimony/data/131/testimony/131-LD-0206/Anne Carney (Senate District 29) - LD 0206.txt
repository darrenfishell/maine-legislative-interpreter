RE: Testimony regarding Part C of LD 206, An Act to Make Supplemental Appropriations and 
Allocations from the General Fund and Other Funds for the Expenditures of State Government 
and to Change Certain Provisions of the Law Necessary to the Proper Operations of State 
Government for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2023  
 
Senators Rotundo and Chipman, Representatives Sachs and Willia ms, and Esteemed Members of 
the Joint Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Taxation : 
 
I am Senator Anne Carney. I proudly represent the people of Senate District 29, which includes 
South Portland, Cape Elizabeth, and part of Sca rborough. In this letter, I offer my testimony in 
opposition to Part C of LD 206.  
 
Part C of LD 206 proposes to re -allocate $10,000,000 that was originally allocated to rehabilitate 
Portland Harbor’s working waterfront, which would generate an estimated $1  billion in 
economic activity. Because of this funding, Portland Harbor would be dredged for the first time 
in decades. It’s necessary to dredge the Harbor to protect the berthing that waterfront industries 
and vessels need to operate and to construct a Co nfined Aquatic Disposal Cell that would safely 
store the contaminated sediment.  
 
For these reasons, I would urge you to amend LD 206 to remove the proposed re -allocation of 
$10,000,000 and uphold the original allocation that was set aside to dredge and reh abilitate piers, 
wharfs, and berthing space along Portland Harbor’s working waterfront. Without this dredging 
and rehabilitation, the local, regional, and state efforts to invigorate the Blue Economy will be 
further delayed and denied.  
 
Thank you for your  consideration and time.
