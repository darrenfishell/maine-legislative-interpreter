LD 206
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and other members of the Appropriations and
Financial Affairs Committee, my name is Karenina Cooper and I live in Newport and 
I retired from RSU 2 as a classroom teacher .   I am here to testify neither for nor 
against the Governor’s proposal for a one-time, 1% cost of living adjustment for all 
current MainePERS retirees. 
I wanted to share my personal story of how I am struggling to keep pace with the rate of 
inflation on a retired teacher's pension.  This school year is my first as a retired teacher and it 
is not going as I had hoped.  My husband and I decided to add him to my health insurance 
since it is such a good health plan.  We had budgeted for that. However as our economy has 
progressed we are having a tough time making ends meet.  Our fuel budget went from 
$215.00 a month last year to $525.00 a month, we have seen a $20.00 a month increase in 
our electricity budget.  Our food bill has increased by a third and we can no longer enjoy 
eating out once a week.  Now, as I approach my 64th birthday I find myself looking for a job 
just to be able to pay my bills.  
   I really appreciated the Governor’s one-time ad hoc cost of living however I feel strongly 
that while it gave some relief this year I am already worried about next year and it is still 
January!
   Thank you for letting me voice my concerns.
