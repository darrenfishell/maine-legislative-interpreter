LD 206
My name is Gary McGrane and I live in Jay. I am a retired teacher from the University of 
Maine. I am the President of the Maine Education Association - Retired. I represent over 5000
active retirees. I am proud to speak Neither For Nor Against LD 206.
Our members can best be described as obeying the speed limit signs yet are punished via 
Maine PERS limited COLA increases. These limits have a discriminatory effect by deflating 
our dedicated educators. I ask this committee to consider the short- and long-term effects of 
keeping our most vulnerable aging citizens with enough retirement income to pay rent, buy 
groceries, and in many cases purchase prescription drugs. Please take into consideration the 
buying power of today's dollars when passing this budget and before the committee leaves 
this issue. Thank you in advance for any help you can provide for our retired dedicated 
workforce.
