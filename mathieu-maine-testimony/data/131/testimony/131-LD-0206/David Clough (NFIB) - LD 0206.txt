Re: LD 206, Section C-5 – Supplemental Budget, Small Business Health Insurance Premium Relief
This statement is made on behalf of the thousands of small business owners throughout Maine who are 
members of NFIB.  They collectively provide jobs and paychecks to about 30,000 people and help form 
the economic backbone of their communities and the state.  
Section C-5 proposes to extend the Small Business Health Insurance Premium Support Program for an 
additional eight months beyond its current expiration date of April 30, 2023.  Such an extension makes 
sense for several reasons:
The program through November 2022 has benefited thousands of these employers and tens of 
thousands of their employees and families – 5,753 small businesses and 46,131 insured people, 
according to available data.
Extending the premium support through the end of 2023 will help make health insurance more 
affordable than it would be without the premium relief, which would help the small businesses 
and workers manage various other costs.
NFIB members do not have a position on other parts of Section C.
The cost of health insurance continues to be a top concern of small business owners and premium costs 
affect decision-making on what benefits, copays and deductibles can be afforded.
Thank you for considering the interests of Maine small businesses.
