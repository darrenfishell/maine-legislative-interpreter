HEARING DATE: 
JANUARY 25, 2023
Senators Rotundo and Brenner, Representatives Sachs and Gramlich, and members of the Joint 
Standing Committees on Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Environment and Natural 
Resources, I am Melanie Loyzim, Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection 
(DEP), providing this testimony in support of DEP-related items in the Governor’s FY23 
Supplemental Budget proposal.
LD 206, FY23 Supplemental Budget
Testimony of: Melanie Loyzim/ Maine DEP
Public Hearing: January 25, 2023

DEP proposes 1 new initiative in the FY23 supplemental budget, found on Page A-20 of the budget 
document. This initiative provides $10,000 in one-time funding to support product sampling for the 
Maine Reduction of Toxics in Packaging program. 
The Reduction of Toxics in Packaging law directly prohibits the sale of packaging containing certain 
heavy metals above specific concentrations, and food packaging containing intentionally added 
phthalates in any amount greater than an incidental presence (32 M.R.S. §1733).  No funding or staff 
have been appropriated for implementation of this law.  In 2022, the Department received complaints 
that 14 products purchased in Maine grocery stores contained phthalates.  The Department investigated 
these complaints and received reassurances from the product manufacturers that phthalates would be 
removed from any products sold in Maine in the future.  The Department received a subsequent 
complaint that the complainant had obtained new analytical results showing phthalates continued to be 
present in some of the products.  In order to pursue formal enforcement for noncompliance based on 
laboratory analytical results, the Department must obtain samples with a controlled chain of custody, 
and must utilize an accredited laboratory if one is available.  
Analytical costs for solid samples vary depending on the complexity of the analytical method, and may 
range roughly from $100 to $500.  The Department does not anticipate needing to sample frequently, 
and estimates that a one-time All Other appropriation of $10,000 should be sufficient to cover 
investigatory costs for at least several years.  If additional funds are needed in the future, the Department 
will address that with the Legislature when such future costs can be more specifically predicted.  
Thank you for the opportunity to provide this overview of the Department’s supplemental budget 
request, and I welcome any questions you may have.
