Janice Vance
Kennebunk
LD 1557
Good morning, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the 
Education & Cultural Affairs Committee. My name is Janice Vance and I am a 
resident of Kennebunk – one of Senator Rafferty’s constituents. I am also a member 
of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition.  I cannot be present to testify today.  I am opposed
to LD 1557. Usually when a legislator writes a bill, he or she is trying to solve a 
problem – even if occasionally that problem exists solely in the legislator’s mind. The
author of LD 1557 didn’t bother with that. I see no explanation of what problem he 
thinks this bill will solve. I don’t see what people he proposes to arm. I don’t see 
anything other than a half-baked bill that wastes the time of the Committee as well as 
the time of those of us who actually read it. I suspect he realized, like the vast 
majority of people realize, that having guns in schools makes no one safe, but perhaps
he was rushed for time the day he had to turn in his assignment and couldn’t muster 
up anything more than a lame title followed by a one sentence repetition of the title. If
I was a teacher in one of the schools he wishes to make safer, I would mark this effort
“incomplete,” and consign it to the nearest round file. Which is what I recommend the
Committee do with it. Please don’t bother advancing this bill.
