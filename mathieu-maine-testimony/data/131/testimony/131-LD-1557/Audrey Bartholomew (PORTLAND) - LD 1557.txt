I am writing to express opposition to this bill.  I am a former teacher and currently 
work to prepare future teachers.  Schools are not going to be any safer with more 
access to guns.  There is NO evidence to suggest conceal and carry will make our 
schools safer.  Teachers will only fear individuals in schools.  It's common teachers 
will need to have tough conversations with families-how can they do this with the fear
a family member has a gun on them?
