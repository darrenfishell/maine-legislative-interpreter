Testimony in Opposition to L.D. 1557 
 
An Act to Increase and Enhance School Safety by Allowing Individuals with Concealed 
Carry Permits to Possess Handguns 
on School Property 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee: 
 
My name is Sandy Lovell, I live in Portland, and I have two grandchildren who attend 
Longfellow Elementary School in Portland. I also volunteer in a Rowe School 2nd grade  
classroom once or twice a week.  
 
I simply want to be one more rational voice asking you to oppose L.D. 1557. 
 
This bill is a living nightmare. I am appalled at the thought of there being concealed 
weapons in schools, near children. 
 
I want my grandchildren’s teachers to be teaching! I want their administrators and other 
school staff to be doing what they are trained to do to help children learn and be productive 
and informed citizens. They are NOT trained and should not be distracted by guns. It is a 
formula for disaster. Where there are guns, people die. 
 
Let’s support schools to put their full attention on creating a vibrant learning environment 
without distractions or fear. Let’s keep guns out of schools. Period. 
 
Please vote ought not to pass L.D. 1557.
