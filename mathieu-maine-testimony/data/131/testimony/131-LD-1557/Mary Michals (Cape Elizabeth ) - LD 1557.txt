I am a former teacher, and a parent.  I wish to ask that this bill be rejected.  Having 
random people possessing firearms in schools is a horrendous idea. We need to keep 
our schools safe as a gun free zones.   Children should not be exposed to firearms.  
What could go wrong?  There are no safeguards or regulations here.  A child could 
gain access to a firearm.  Children donâ€™t miss much.  They would quickly figure out 
who is carrying a gun.  An untrained individual should not be allowed to carry a 
firearm into a school!   This is not the same as law enforcement.  Are we wanting to 
have our schools to become shooting galleries?  Please use common sense and reject 
this illogical proposal.
