Please vote to allow Concealed carry permittees the right to carry on school properties
for the safety of all Mainers. The data show them to be safe and careful individuals 
that act responsibly and are willing to sacrifice and be of service in the protection of 
others. Please take a serious look at the data of cities where gun control is strongest 
and you will not be able to deny the reality that these are or are becoming the most 
gun violent areas in our country. We need to protect the innocent . We appreciate your
support in letting permitted CC holders carry on school grounds.
