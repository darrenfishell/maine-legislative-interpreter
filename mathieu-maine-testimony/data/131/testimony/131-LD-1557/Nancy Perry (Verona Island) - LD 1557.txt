Thank you for the opportunity to express my support for LD1557:
"An Act to Increase and Enhance School Safety by Allowing Individuals with 
Concealed Carry Permits to Possess Handguns on School Property”
I am a grandmother now - I want my grandchild to be protected in school.  I want 
armed personnel near her and ready to defend her and others should the need arise.
Signs designating gun free zones only tell the potential shooters that there is nobody 
there to defend the innocent.  Our children deserve our protection - who else loves 
them enough to do so?  Our government officials are far more protected in their 
workplace than our own children are in schools.
Individuals with concealed carry permits have undergone firearm training to safely 
use those firearms and many will use them when faced with active shooters 
determined to maim and kill our children and their teachers.  Imagine, instead, signs 
that declare: “Warning, Staff are carrying & trained in the use of firearms.”   A 
potential killer will give a second thought to his/her planned action - the bully backs 
down when he/she cannot victimize.   If the potential killer still attempts to harm, 
response time from protectors will be quick to prevent and/or minimize any damage.
