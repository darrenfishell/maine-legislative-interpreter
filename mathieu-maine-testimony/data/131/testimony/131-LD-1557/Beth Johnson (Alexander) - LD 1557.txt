Greetings!
I believe this bill is a bill of common sense. Gun free zones make our schools 
vulnerable to unstable killers. A killer wants to maximize their kill. If they have a 
choice between a gun free zone and the option of being killed before even firing a 
shot, well, common sense! I pray someday that all schools will be protected, but for 
today, let's set an example for the rest of the country. Let's forewarn any unstable 
killers that stepping into a Maine school would not be wise.
Thank you!
