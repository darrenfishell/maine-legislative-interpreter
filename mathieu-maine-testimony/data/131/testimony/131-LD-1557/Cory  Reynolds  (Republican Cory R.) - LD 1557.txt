LD 1557
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Honorable Members of the 
Committee: 
I am Testifying today in Support of LD-1557 - An Act to Increase and Enhance 
School Safety by Allowing Individuals with Concealed Carry Permits to Possess 
Handguns on School Property. Most school mass shootings over the last 20 years 
have occurred in "gun free" zones.
Allowing school Staff to conceal carry would be critical in saving lives in the event of
another tragedy shooting. I ask you to please vote Ought To Pass LD-1557.
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
