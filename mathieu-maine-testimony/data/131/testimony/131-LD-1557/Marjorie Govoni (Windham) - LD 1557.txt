I am a school board member and have been for 13 years and I do not support this 
proposal to allow people to carry concealed weapons in any school. People react 
differently when put in any compromising situation and to put students and staff in a 
situation that could endanger their lives is not okay. These people are not trained how 
to react in stressful situations and it creates a dangerous situation and my job is to 
ensure all staff and students safety.
