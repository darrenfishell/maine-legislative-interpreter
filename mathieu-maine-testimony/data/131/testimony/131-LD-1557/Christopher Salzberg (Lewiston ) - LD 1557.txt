Hello Committee Members,  
     I ask you to vote in favor of LD 1557 - An Act to Increase and Enhance School 
Safety by Allowing Individuals with Concealed Carry Permits to Possess Handguns 
on School Property.
    Studies have found concealed carry permit holders are the most law-abiding 
citizens who have gone through a rigorous screening process to obtain their permits. 
They have demonstrated that they are responsible, trained, and trustworthy enough to 
carry firearms. Allowing concealed carry permit holders to carry firearms on school 
grounds would create a safer environment for students, teachers, and staff. In the 
event of an active shooter situation, a permit holder could potentially stop the threat 
and save lives. The threat is always stopped by a good guy with a gun.
     There are already examples of states that allow concealed carry on school grounds 
and have not experienced any negative consequences as a result. In fact, studies have 
shown that crime rates decrease in areas where there are more concealed carry permit 
holders. Many schools in Maine already have school resource officers on campus, but 
it is not feasible for every school to have such resources. Private schools and some 
public schools don’t have these police officers available to them. Allowing concealed 
carry permit holders to legally carry on school grounds would provide an additional 
layer of protection. 
     If we allow police officers to carry on school grounds then why can’t we allow 
concealed carry permit holders. Studies have found that permit holders commit less 
crime than even police officers. There is no evidence or reason to restrict permit 
holders from protecting their children, schools, and communities. Please vote in favor 
of LD 1557. Thank you for your time.
