LD 1557
Members of the Joint Committee on Education, this testimony is submitted in 
opposition to the following proposals: LDs 52, 518, and 1557. 
I am a semi-retired public health professional, and I have family members who own 
and use guns to hunt.  I will not reiterate the data and stories that you will have heard 
from others testifying on these bills.  As a long-time resident and voter in this State, I 
will just say that what you do matters to all of us. 
I strongly encourage you to reject these proposals: 
•LD 52: An Act To Allow Certain School Employees To Carry Firearms On School
Property
•LD 518: An Act To Allow Armed Security In Schools 
•LD 1557: An Act To Increase And Enhance School Safety By Allowing 
Individuals With Concealed Carry Permits To Possess Handguns On School Property
These bills will not protect children, teachers, and the staff in our schools. Instead, 
these bills threaten the safety of children, teachers, and the staff in Maine schools – 
and our communities.
Thank you for your consideration. 
Judith A. Feinstein, Hallowell
