Good morning, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee. My name is Loren Arford. l have lived in Brunswick, Maine for over 
35 years. lam here to testify in opposition to LD 1557. 
l am a professional engineer who had the good fortune of teaching a high school pre- 
engineering program for 15 years. Now, as much as my busy retired life allows, I enjoy substitute 
teaching at Brunswick High School. As a teacher I have been through several years of lockdovvn 
protocol and practicing different solutions to student safety. I have participated in many 
discussions on what we, as teachers, would do in the event of an active shooter incident. 
Let me be clear, I have no objections to responsible, law abiding, gun ownership and use. 
Firearms ownership is provided for by law and l respect this, yet guns are not permitted in 
schools where young people are formulating the maturity to handle life. As a retired teacher E 
have a major issue with allowing any person, excluding trained school safety officers, to carry 
concealed handguns within our schools. l remember discussing with my teacher colleagues if 
we should be allowed to carry a gun including concealed carry. My fellow teachers and l agreed 
that it was not ourjob to be armed security personnel - rather our job was to protect the 
students by keeping guns out of the school. We unanimously agreed we were not interested in 
carrying guns in the school. l\/lost likely our fear and emotions would rule if there was an 
incident, and we were carrying â€” creating a MUCH more dangerous situation. 
l ask you to please vote to keep our school kids safe, vote ought not to pass on LD 1557.
