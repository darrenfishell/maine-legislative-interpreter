Testimony in Ogposltion to LD 52, LD 518 and LD 1557 
Chairs Rafferty and Brennan and Education Committee Members, 
I am a teacher and the mother of a teacher. I urge you to vote against LD 52, LD 518 and LD 
1557. All three bills would increase the number of guns in Maine schools. Although they 
purport to enhance school safety, they would actually make schools less safe by increasing the 
likelihood that a gun could be used, purposefully or by accident, in a way that injures or kills 
students and/or school staff. 
I was working in a Portland high school in 1999 when the shooting at Columbine High School 
killed 13 people and wounded 20 others. I still remember how sick I felt listening to the news 
reports at the time. In the nearly 25 years since then, our country has been shaken by one mass 
killing after another, many of them in schools. Portland was one of several school districts in 
Maine that went through a lockdown earlier this year when a gun threat was reported. 
Arming teachers and other school staff is not the answer to our country's problem with gun 
violence. Rather, we must outlaw the most dangerous weapons such as assault riï¬‚es, tighten 
regulations about who can own a gun, require universal background checks and increase 
funding for mental health care. 
I work in a school system with many students and adults who came to this country to escape 
violence in their home countries. Merely seeing weapons in a supposedly safe place like school 
is traumatizing to some of them. I urge you to vote down these bills, which will only make our 
schools more dangerous for students and staff.
