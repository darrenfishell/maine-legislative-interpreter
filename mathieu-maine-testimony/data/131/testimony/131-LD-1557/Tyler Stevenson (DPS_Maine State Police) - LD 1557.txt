Testimony of Lieutenant Tyler Stevenson  
Maine State Police 
 
In Opposition of (1557) 
 
An Act to Increase and Enhance School Safety by All owing Individuals with Concealed Carry Permits to 
Possess Handguns on School Property.   
 
Sponsored by Representative Paul 
 Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and  honorable members of the Committee on Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety:  My name is Lieutenant T yler Stevenson and I have provided written testimon y on behalf of 
the Maine State Police and the Maine Department of Public Safety to testify in opposition of LD 1557, “An Act to 
Increase and Enhance School Safety by Allowing Indi viduals with Concealed Carry Permits to Possess Han dguns on 
School Property.”   
 
Maine Department of Public Safety and Maine State P olice is opposed to LD 1557 due to possible safety concerns.  
As an officer, responding to a report of an active shooter or armed person at a school is one of the m ost stressful, 
chaotic, and emotional experiences that a police of ficer will ever encounter.  Although highly trained , a police officer 
in this situation is likely to experience heightene d levels of adrenaline and cortisol coursing throug h their body as it 
reacts to the stress they are facing.  The officer may also experience “tunnel vison” and “auditory ex clusion” as they 
enter the school in search of a shooter or armed su bject and will rely on their training to stop the a ctive threat.  
Information regarding the suspect(s) identity will likely be limited, meaning the police officer will have to react to 
what they are observing in real time.  As a result,  you can understand that if a police officer in thi s situation 
encounters a concerned citizen that is also armed w ith a handgun and not identified in anyway as a pol ice officer, it 
could potentially result in a tragedy and, at minim um, slow the officer’s response. 
 
Another potential safety concern is the reality tha t a handgun that is concealed is not always truly h idden.  
Handguns come in different sizes, shapes, and color s and so do the holsters and packs that contain the m.  
Additionally, some handguns are more suitable than others for concealed carry purposes. There are time s when it 
becomes obvious that someone is carrying a handgun,  namely when a handgun is carried under a tight shi rt or 
becomes inadvertently exposed when bending over, su ch as to pick up a backpack or get a drink from a w ater 
fountain.  If a teacher or student observes an unkn own person carrying a handgun in a school, it could  result in panic, 
school lockdowns, and calls to the police that are not needed.
