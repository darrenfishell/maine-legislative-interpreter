Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, my name is Shawn Doil and I am a 
resident of Portland. I have one child in school and another starting in the fall.  
I oppose LD 52, LD518, and LD 1557, because more guns, especially guns in 
schools, is not the solution to our gun violence problem. This has been proven time 
and time again. It has also been proven that there are actual solutions to the gun 
violence problems, assault weapons ban, background checks, safe storage, red flag 
laws. And those are actions items that will actually protect our kids and our schools. I 
strongly oppose any effort to put guns in schools in any manner.
