Thank you to the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee for reading my 
testimony. I am a mother, wife, active community member, voter, and school 
employee. My husband and sons hunt and our family does own guns. I understand the
urge to do something to protect our children and school staff from mass shootings and
other forms of violence at school. However, I resist the urge to fight violence with 
more guns. More access to weapons is not the answer to this complex issue. More 
guns in school will allow more access to guns and more opportunity for gun related 
violence. The US Secret Service document analyzing school violence points out that 
access to firearms is one of the determinants of school violence occurring. Access to 
firearms triples the risk of death by suicide and doubles the risk of death by homicide.
Armed civilians do not stop mass shootings but they do complicate the scene for law 
enforcement response. This document and many others note that safe, nurturing 
school and communities are the greatest protective factors. Sensible laws like: gun 
storage requirements; age limits on gun purchasing, background checks, extreme risk 
laws, and reducing access to semiautomatic weapons are a big piece of the puzzle. 
And equally important is the need to increase student supports like: more guidance 
and social work staff, better training for staff on how to assess risk and best intervene,
restorative justice practices, anonymous reporting of treats, and a detailed treat 
assessment process. Letâ€™s focus on how to improve our schools, meet the needs of 
students and families in our communities, reduce access to guns, and increase school 
supports and practices as the proven and most effective ways to increase safety and 
educate our next generation for a brighter future.
