I am a mother and grandmother speaking out on behalf of my children and 
grandchildren. Having more firearms in schools by allowing individuals with 
concealed carry permits to possess handguns on school property is NOT a solution to 
the epidemic of gun violence in our country. I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to this 
legislation (LD1557). More individuals with guns on school property will only 
increase the potential for more violence and trauma for students, parents and teachers 
-- This is WRONG!
