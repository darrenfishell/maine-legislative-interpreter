Good morning. 
Regarding this bill, which allows “ a person with a permit to carry concealed 
handguns to possess a firearm on public school property or the property of an 
approved private school,” what is this about, really? Law enforcement? Vigilantes 
being in the right place at the right time to take down an alleged school shooter? A 
wild turkey hunter traversing a ball field? This is absolutely frightening.
Let’s concentrate on fewer guns in the hands of non-trained law enforcement officers,
not more. This bill is without clear definition and purpose.
