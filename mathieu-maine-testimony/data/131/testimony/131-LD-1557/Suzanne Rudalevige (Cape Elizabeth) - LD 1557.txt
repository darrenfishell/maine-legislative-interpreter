Testimony for the 131st Session of the Maine Legislature 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
 
Public Hearing: April 26, 2023 
 
 LD. 1557:  An Act to Increase and Enhance School Safety by Allowing 
Individuals with Concealed Carry Permits to Possess Handguns on 
School Property.   
 
Chairperson Senator Joseph Rafferty and Representative Michael Brennan 
and Members of the Committee, my name is Suzanne Rudalevige and I 
live in Cape Elizabeth. 
 
I strongly oppose this bill. 
I take issue with the title of this proposal since I do not believe that guns 
provide any safety, but in fact create further risk through accident and 
misadventure. I can think of little worse than this kind of proliferation of 
guns on school property. I assume permitted carriers would include parents 
and visitors:  it is not like we have stringent guns laws about possessing 
such permission. A better solution is to restrict access to guns in general 
rather than expand it. 
 Please do not recommend this bill or passage. 
Thank you.
