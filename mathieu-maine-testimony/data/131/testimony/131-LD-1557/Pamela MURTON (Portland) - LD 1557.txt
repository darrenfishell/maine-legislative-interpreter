I unilaterally oppose the carrying and use of firearms in Maine schools.  Nothing will 
be gained, and much will be lost should the bills calling for the use of guns in schools 
be enacted into law.  Certainly, there are other methods by which we can keep 
children and adults safe in educational settings. Legislators, please use your 
intelligence, creativity and sense of duty to oppose the passing of any bill that would 
allow firearms in Maine schools, and to develop alternative methods of enhancing 
safety.
