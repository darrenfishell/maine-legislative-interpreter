Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Honorable Members of the Committee:  
 
I am writing to you regarding Legislative Document 1557 (LD 1557), an act to increase and 
enhance school safety by allowing individuals with concealed carry permits to possess handguns 
on school property. On behalf of the National Rifle Association, I would like to express our 
support for this bill. 
 
LD 1557 enhances school safety by eliminating “gun-free zones” at Maine schools by allowing 
concealed carry permit holders to carry handguns on public school property or the property of an 
approved private school. Gun-free zones do nothing but disarm law-abiding citizens and create 
soft targets for violent criminals. Currently, Maine law prohibits teachers, administrators, staff, 
and parents from possessing a firearm on campus. This bill changes that to allow these law-
abiding citizens to protect themselves and their children during regular school hours and during 
extracurricular activities. Most importantly, this bill would deter violent criminals from targeting 
Maine schools.   
 
When seconds count, police are often minutes away.  Having capable guardians present with the 
proper tools is proven to prevent violent crime.  On behalf of the thousands of NRA members in 
Maine, I respectfully urge the committee to support this legislation. Please do not hesitate to 
contact me if you have additional questions or concerns.  
 
Sincerely,   
 
Justin  E. Davis  
State  Director,  NRA-ILA
