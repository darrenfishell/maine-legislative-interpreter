LD 1557
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs,
LD 1557 is a recipe for disaster…and does just the opposite of what it proposes to do.
•People with Concealed Carry Permits are not required to have training of any kind 
in the use of the firearm, let alone regular and frequent safety training pertaining to 
active shooter situations in a public space 
•High Schools have 18 year olds..this proposed law would allow them to have a 
concealed gun in the classroom…again…no training of any type required.
•Accidents happen and a person can leave their gun where it is picked up by 
someone who has not passed the low bar of a voluntary criminal background check or
self-admitted and self-reported mental disorders and/or drug problems.
•Teaching is tough enough as it is…a majority of teachers do not want to add a high
risk atmosphere into their schools where just about anyone eighteen and older can 
carry concealed weapons, including 18 year old students in their classrooms.  None of
these folks who have a permit for concealed carry are required to train in the safe use 
of a firearm nor are required to train as police are trained… to handle guns in public 
spaces in active shooter situations.
LD 1557 would DECREASE SCHOOL SAFETY.
Vote LD 1557 ONTP out of Committee.   
Sincerely.
