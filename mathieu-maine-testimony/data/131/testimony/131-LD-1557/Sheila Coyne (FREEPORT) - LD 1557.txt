Statement Against Guns in Schools     Apr. 25, 2023 
 
Good Morning, my name is Sheila Coyne, I am the Aunt of six and Grand-Aunt of twelve.  As a former 
elementary school teacher, I am fundamentally opposed to allowing guns in schools.  Whether it be in 
the form of school employees, armed security or individuals with concealed carry permits on school 
property.  Any such legislation will only fuel the fire on gun violence.  
Should funds be made available to protect our children and grandchildren on school property, the better 
option would be to have metal detectors and backpack checks available at controlled main entrances of 
schools. This combined with the presence of designated school safety officers, from local police 
departments, would be a good step forward to addressing the continuing challenge of protecting our 
children. 
Thank you for your consideration.
