LD 1557
I urge support and passage of the following proposed bills:
LD-1557-which would allow individuals with concealed carry permits to carry on 
public or private school grounds.
LD 52-An act to allow certain school employees to carry firearms on school property.
LD 518-an act to allow armed security in schools.
     These bills are all great ideas and realistic when it comes to protecting our kids.
