In opposition to LD 1557 
Good afternoon Senator Harrington and Rep Andrews and hard working members of 
the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.  
My name is Steve Eagles and I ask that you vote not to pass LD 1557, An act to allow
individuals with Concealed Carry Permits to Possess Handguns on School Property.  
All 3 of my children attended public school in Richmond, K-12 and I did NOT fear 
for their safety when NO firearms were permitted on school grounds.  I would have 
feared for their safety had I known that firearms were permitted on school grounds.  
There is no way to guarantee that a firearm will not get into the wrong hands or that it 
may be discharged in error and haste.
I am also a long term Unitarian Universalist and am active in our denominational 
political action arm known as Maine Unitarian- Universalist State Advocacy 
Network.  As a believer in the democratic process and the power of Love, we do not 
believe that problems can be solved by the use of force.  Recent events have shown 
the futility of trained and armed police being available at schools.  Some situations the
armed person fled when an armed person arrived, in another instance there were 
armed and trained individuals who stood outside a classroom while shots were being 
fired.  Please do not believe that a committed and potentially deranged shooter can be 
stopped by having armed people on site.
I believe that, on occasion, a trained professional law enforcement official has 
mistakenly shot an innocent people and I believe that is a much higher risk than a 
potential shooter entering Maine public schools. 
Thank you for you work,
Steven Eagles
