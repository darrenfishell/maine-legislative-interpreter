www.maineaap.org  Testimony in O pposition to LD 1557: “An Act to Increase and 
Enhance School Safety by Allowing Individuals with Concealed 
Carry Permits to Possess Handguns on School Propert y.” 
Senator R afferty, Representative Brennan,  and dis tinguished members of 
the Education and Cultural Aff airs Committee, I am Dr. Dan Hale  of 
Kittery, Maine and a Board Member for the Maine AAP. 
As a father, pediatrician, and responsible firearm owner I support 
commonsense measures to prevent firearm violence. There is no “easy” 
unifying intervention that will end firearm violence, but there are several 
measures that can move us in the right direction of saving lives. 
However, LD 1557 does not add value as an attempt to keep our schools 
safe.  
I feel  this bill should not pass  because  indiscriminate concealed handgun 
carry in schools will lead to accidental shootings.  In addition, in an active 
shooter situation, an armed person may be at risk of being shot by 
responding police officers who cannot tell who the “good guy” is  and who 
the “bad guy”  is. 
There is a long history of responsible firearm ownership in Maine . 
Fami lies have been hunting and fishing together for centuries. The 
legislature should focus on measures that strengthen safety measures 
without causing potential inadvertent harm.  
Thank you for keeping our communities safe,  
Dan Hale, M.D.,FAAP, SFHM
