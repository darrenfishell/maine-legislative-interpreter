LD 1557
I strongly urge you to oppose LD1557.
To allow a person with a concealed weapon permit to Possess Handguns on School 
Property to increase and enhance School Safety does not make sense to me.
I speak from 5 decades of working in education, both as a teacher and an 
administrator both department of defense schools as well as Kansas, Vermont and 
Maine!
This proposes a fear for me and cannot imagine how active educators, children,  
parents and the communities would feel if passed.
Please sincerely consider my request to oppose LD 1557.
