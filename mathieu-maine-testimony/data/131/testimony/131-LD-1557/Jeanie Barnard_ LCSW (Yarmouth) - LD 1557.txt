Dear Committee Members:
I cannot overestimate how misguided and ineffective I consider this bill to be. As a 
psychotherapist with over 40 years of experience working with teachers I can tell you 
that the last thing school personnel want or need is to wonder who might be carrying a
concealed weapon in school and if it might go off.  This increases the real danger for 
everyone, and provides no added protection. What school personnel need is and 
deserve is help with keeping guns out of schools which would include methods we 
already have identified. including background checks for all gun sales, red flag laws, 
getting rid of automatic weapons. This bill implies we have no recourse but to arm 
ourselves. This is simply not true.
