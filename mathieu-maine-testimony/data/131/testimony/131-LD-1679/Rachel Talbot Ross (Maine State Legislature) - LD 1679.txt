RACHEL TALBOT ROSS 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
Wednesday, May 31st, 2023 
Testimony of Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross supporting 
LD 1 6 79 An Act Regarding 
the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary 
Senator Camey, Representative Moonen, and other distinguished members 
of the Judiciary Committee I am Rachel Talbot Ross and I represent House 
District 118 which 1S the Portland peninsula I also have the distinct honor of 
serving as Maine Speaker of the House I am here today to present testimony in 
support of LD 1679, An Act Regarding the Maine Indian Tribal-State 
Commission. 
I applaud and commend Representative Dana for identifying a problem in 
the operation of Maine Indian Tribal-State Connnission (lVl1TSC), and then 
introducing this bill to amend the Maine Implementing Act The proposed 
amendments to the Implementing Act will help correct the process of rebuilding 
and strengthening Tribal-State relations of the State of Maine, the Passamaquoddy 
Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 
This measure will address the protracted issue that has impaired MITSC’s 
ability for Tribal government appointed and State government appointed members 
to come together and develop reports and recommendations to the Legislature and 
the Tribes to improve the effectiveness of the Settlement legislation and the 
relationships between the State and the Tribes LD 1679 will allow for a statutory 
change in quorum requirements in the event of a commission vacancy, the change 
being the lowering of quorum requirements by the number of vacant members, 
with a ﬂoor of seven members The current requirement of seven afﬁrmative votes 
for decisions and actions would remain unchanged 
Currently, a quorum of the 13-member commission, 1S nine members This 
1S unlike many other state committees that need a simple ma] ority, or like your own 
District 118: Portland neighborhoods of Parkside, Bayside, East Bayside, Oakdale and 
the University of Southern Maine Campus
pol1cy commrttee whlch needs a slmple ma] orrty, w1th one member of the quorum 
bemg a Senator and regardless of party, to make commlttee motlons 
LD 1679 w1ll also address the problem of mass vacancres by staggerlng the 
terms of MITSC membersh1p so that the comm1ss1on does not ﬁnd 1tse1f strugghng 
to reach a quorum when members are no longer able to contmue thelr role 
For background, MITSC was created 1n 1980 as one part of the Mame 
Indlan Land Clalms Settlement MITSC was mcluded 1n the Mame Implementmg 
Act due to the understandmg that the agreement between the State and Trrbal 
governments was a l1v1ng document that needed constant study and 1mprovement 
Accordrng to l\/HTSC’s by-laws 
The Commzsszon zs charged under the terms of the Act to contznually revzew 
the eﬂectzveness of the Act, to asszst wzth the zmplementatzon of certam 
provzszons of the Act, to contmually revzew the soczal, economzc, and legal 
relatzonshzp between the Houlton Band of Mahseet Indzans, Passamaquoddy 
T rzbe, Penobscot Natzon, and the State, and to make such reports and 
recommendatzons to the Legzslature, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indzans, 
Passamaquoddy Trzbe, and the Penobscot Natzon as the Commzsszon deems 
approprzate 
MITSC 1s also tasked w1th cons1der1ng the 1nclus1on of future lands as Indlan 
terntory, promulgat1ng ﬁshmg rules and regulat1ons, lmplementmg 1‘1OI1-I1'ld13.l ’1 ﬁsh 
and w1ld11fe pol1c1es to protect trrbal lands and waters, and to consrder the creatlon 
of future Indlan com1nun1t1es 
l\/HTSC’s 13 members reﬂect s1x members appo1nted by the Governor, two 
by the Houlton Band ofMal1seetInd1ans, two by the Passamaquoddy Trrbe, and 
two by the Penobscot Natron The ﬁnal 13th member 1s a chalrperson selected bya 
ma] or1ty of the other 12 members 
The Comm1ss1on also allows for the part1c1pat1on of other federally 
recognlzed Mame Tnbes who are not mcluded 1n MICSA as ofﬁclal observers 
Currently, that 1s only the M1’kmaq Natlon 
On May 24, 2019, Governor Janet M1lls nom1nated s1x new state members 
for the COII11‘I1lSS101 ’1 - John Cashwell, Robert Checkoway, James Cote, Kevln 
Hancock, former Senator Mrchael Pearson, and former Senator R1cha:rd Rosen
4 
These s1x appolntments were all made after state membershlp began to decrease in 
2013 when the State stopped makmg regular reappomtments to l\/[ITSC 
At a press conference 1n Apr1l 2019, the Governor shared her v1s1on for 
rev1tal1z1ng Tr1bal-State relatrons by real1z1ng the full operatlon of MITSC “I’d 
rather communlcate than lrtlgate, put 1t that way And MITSC could be a good 
forum for communrcatlon” 
S1nce the Governor ’s 2019 appolntments of 6 members to MITSC, one new 
appomtment, Sarah Medma, was made followrng the death of the Honorable 
Mrchael Pearson Srnce June 2022, four state members have left the Commrssron 
The other two members are servlng on the Comrn1ss1on nearly one year past the 
exp1rat1on of thelr terms Your commlttee has yet to see any reapporntments 
The current actlve membershrp of MITSC totals mne members — s1x on the 
Tr1bal s1de, two on the State srde, and the Charrperson who was elected by the 
appomted comm1ss1oners 1n early 2022 when the comm1ss1on membershlp was 
full Wlth a statutory quorum of nlne members, schedulmg gymnastrcs are needed 
for the Comm1ss1on to at least meet to do the1r work Wh1le remote part1c1pat1on 
has been helpful to establrsh a quorum, 1t has been over three years s1nce n1ne 
members of l\/HTSC have been 1n the same room, and multlple scheduled meet1ngs 
have been postponed or cancelled altogether 
From my ofﬁce’s understandmg, several requests for new appomtments 
have been made to the Govemor’s ofﬁce by MITSC comm1ss1oners and staff 
members Yet, no actron has been taken and the problem persrsts 
If the State of Mame sees MITSC as a forum to rmprove Trlbal-State 
relatrons, the State of Mame, by fa1l1ng to make appolntments, has not 
demonstrated 1ts commrtment to that goal 
LD 1679 1s not ask1ng for much It 1s not asklng for lmpartral balance 1n 
membershlp It 1s not askrng for the compos1t1on of membershrp to change It 1s 
proposlng a srmple ﬁx to allow the Mame Indran Trrbal-State Commrssron to be 
able to meet and develop pol1cy recommendatlons to th1s body to lmprove Tr1bal- 
State relatrons 
Thank you for t1me and attentlon I am happy to take questrons, but there are 
others w1th more knowledge on th1s SLlb_]6Ct than I am that can be more l’l6lpﬁ1l
