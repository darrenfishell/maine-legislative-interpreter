Testimony of ROBERT CHECKOWAY of Freeport 
In Support of LD 1679, “An Act Regarding the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission” 
Good mormng Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, ladies and gentlemen I’m one of the members 
of ﬂie Maine Indian Tnbal-State Commission (l\/l1T SC) I was appomted by Governor Mills for a teim of 
three years eifective Jime 18, 2019, and have willmgly overstayed my welcome as we wait for the 
appointment and conﬁrmation of replacement members - which are the subject of this bill 
MITSC 1S a very unusual organization -- one of a very few, if not the only, jomt decision-making body in 
the Umted States comprised of native and non-native representatives The Commission was created as 
part of the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Implementing Act (MIA), designed to regulate ﬁshing 
m boundary waters, 30 M RS A § 6207(3), consider additions to or extensions of reservations of the 
Penobscot Nation and Passainaquoddy Tnbe, id § 6204(5) and — what has become its most regular 
activity — reporting to the Legislature and the participating tribes 
In addition to the responsibilities set forth m this Act, the commission shall continually review the 
effectiveness of this Act and the social, economic and legal relationship between the Houlton 
Band of Mahseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tnbe and the Penobscot Nation and the State and 
make such reports and recommendations as it determines appropriate 
so M RS A § 6212(3) 
The Commission is statutorily composed of SIX members appomted by the Governor, subject to 
legislative conﬁrmation, and two from each of the three participating native tl‘1b6S,1 with those 12 
members in turn appointing a Chaiipeison. The enabling statute also provides, “Nme members constitute 
a quorum and a decision or action of the commission 1S not vahd unless 7 members vote m favor of the 
action or decision” 
Although the statute has provided since its adoption that members serve tliree-year terms, it has been 
diﬂicult to replace State members suice — among oﬂier challenges -- that process requires legislative 
conﬁimatioii, and the terms of members do not comcide with legislative sessions Since all six State 
terms now expire at the same time, and vacancies remain unﬁlled until the legislature is m session, the 
Commission can ﬁnd itselfunable to muster the required quorum during these interim periods The native 
tribes, by contrast, mamtain a “unitary executive ” and appomtments by the several Chiefs do not require 
separate conﬁrmation by tribal coimcils, avoiding this gap between the separate powers of the State 
government2 
MITSC has been an experiment m state-tribal relations, largely without precedent, and 1S in a continuing 
process of reinvention Like other diplomatic endeavors, action requires dehberation and there are no

The Aroostook Band of Mic’Maq Indians did not join m the 1980 Acts but enjoys “observer ” status 
under MITSC by-laws 
2 During development of this proposal a consensus was ﬁrst reached which would have applied the 
stagger also to native appomtinents to preserve symmetry, but we soon realized there was no easy way to 
also do so without creating mequality between tribes Since native appomtments do not face the same 
built-m delays as State members, the commission agreed to leave native terms unchanged in the proposal 
as introduced'

institutional or external processes to force agreement At various pomts in history individual members 
have been withdrawn by their governments in protest, and the work of the Cormnission was brought toa 
full stop when, pnor to the election of Governor Mills, the State snnply failed to ﬁll vacancies While ﬂris 
Governor has pledged to support MITSC by maintainmg its State delegation, recruiting and selecting 
replacements 1S nevertheless a time-consuining process 
LD 167 9 would moderate ﬂiis timing problem by staggering the six State terms, appointing two members 
for a term of one years, two others for two years, and a third pair for three years Although the current 
draft does not so state, I recommend that any amending provision specify that all future 
appointment terms of later members after this initial three-step stagger would be for three-year 
terms I also note that the bill as drafted would create a numerical anomaly, amending § 6212(3) but 
then addmg new subsections 2 and3 
The adjustment proposed by this bill, if enacted, would then himt ﬂie number of State vacancies pending 
replacement no more than two at a time, leavmg ll members (including the Chair) m ofﬁce and so 
mamtainmg the membership above the currently required q11OI'UIIl of nine 
One consequence of the proposed adjustment of terms proposed here is that, by spreadmg appomtments 
over a three-year cycle, the mﬂuence of successive Govemors would be “smoothed out” as members 
appomted by successive administrations would then overlap 
Even without vacancies, however, a surplus of only two members over ﬂie required quorum would leave 
still the group unable to act ofﬁcially when any two of the remammg number are tmavailable Subsection 
(1) of ﬂiis bill would enhance the eifect of the staggered terms by reducmg the required quorum to seven 
- the mmimum needed for an etfective vote 
I urge you to vote this measure Ought to Pass — as amended, if needed, to specify that the proposed 
adjustment only operates once, and that after six new State members have been appointed for their 
varying terms, all renewals or replacements would be for three years, and to adjust the numbering 
sequence 
Thank you. The members of the Mame Indian Tribal-State Comimssion have followed the proceedings 
and discussions in this Committee closely over the last three years and have been unpressed with its grasp 
of the issues and inspired by your consideration
