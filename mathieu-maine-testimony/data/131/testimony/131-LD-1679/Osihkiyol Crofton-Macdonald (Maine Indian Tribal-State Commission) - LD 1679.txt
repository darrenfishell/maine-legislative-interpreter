LD 1679, An Act Regard1ng the Mame Ind1an Tnbal-State Comm1ss1on 
Test1mony subm1tted by Os1hk1yol Crofton-Macdonald, on behalf of the Mame Ind1an Tr1bal- 
State Comm1ss1on 
Senator Carney, Representat1ve Moonen, and the Judlclary Comm1ttee, thank you for the t1me to 
speak today 
My name 1s Os1hk1y01 Crofton-Macdonald, I currently serve as the Tnbal Ambassador for the 
Houlton Band of Mal1seets and have served as the Tr1ba1 Co-Commlssloner for the Houlton 
Band on the Mame Ind1an Tr1ba1 State Comm1ss1on for the past 4 years 
I a1n here to prov1de testrmony 1n support of LD 1679, An Act Regard1ng the Ma1ne Ind1an 
Trlbal-State Commlsslon As you have heard from others, the purpose of the COIIIIIIISSIOII slnce 
1ts creatlon 1n 1980 has been to fac1l1tate a work1ng relat1onsh1p between the Wabanak1 Nat1ons 
and the State 1n an effort to contmually assess the efﬁcacy of the Mame Implement1ng Act 
As I am sure I don’t need to expla1n, tlns relat1onsh1p has had 1ts ups and downs over the years, 
but I thmk 1t 1s worth pomt1ng out that many of the 1ssues the Tr1balNat1ons have h1ghl1ghted 1n 
recent years concernlng ways they w1sh to see th1s relatlonshlp lmprove, notably the 1ssues 
outlmed 1n the Task Force Recommendatlons from LD 1626 last year, and the lssue hlghhghted 
m LD 2004 th1s sess1on to clarlfy the language surroundlng access to federal beneﬁc1al laws, are 
almost entlrely problems that MITSC has h1ghl1ghted as 1ssues 1n need of attennon for over the 
past 25 years I would recommend readlng the MITSC report t1tled "At Loggerheads The State 
of Ma1ne and the Wabanak1" wh1ch was publ1shed back 1n 1997 In th1s report, and s1m1lar 
reports you can ﬁnd on the MITSC webslte, the Comm1ss1on brought attent1on to many of the 
same 1ssues we are st1ll faclng today 
S1nce 1ts creatlon, l\/IITSC has served the funct1on of bnng1ng attentlon to these 1ssues Issues 
that would ultlmately need to be negotlated between the Tr1balNat1ons and the State 
MITSC 1s not the body that makes dec1s1ons regardmg tlns relat1onsh1p, they have, however, 
been very helpful 1n draft1ng reports and studles Wl11Ch help to educate the people of Mame and 
draw attent1on to 1ssues 1n need of address 
Th1s b111, LD 1679, does somethmg very s1mp1e and strmghtforward It s1mp1y1mproves the way 
MITSC funct1ons and allows the comm1ss1on to contmue to funct1on even when we are 1n the 
pos1t1on, such as the one we are currently 1n, when we struggle to meet quorum requ1rements 
every t1me we meet It also seeks to lmplement a system of staggered term l1m1ts to allevlate tlns 
contmually reoccunmg problem movlng 1nto the future 
The Speaker’s ofﬁce and others have done a helpful _]Ob 1n explalnmg how we contmually end up 
1n th1s pos1t1on, and the reason why we are suggestlng staggered term l1m1ts and a method for 
reduced quorum, but as a currently serv1ng Tnbal Comm1ss1oner, I thought 1t would be helpful to 
share my expenence
For perhaps the past 6 months, we have struggled to reach quorum at every meetmg Rrght now, 
1f we don’t have every smgle comm1ss1oner 1n attendance, we cannot meet In effect, the 
rmportant work MITSC should be dolng can be stalled by a s1ngle comm1ss1oner ’s busy 
schedule When we do have a full and actrvely engaged membershlp, MITSC funct1ons far better 
Th1s 1s not a new problem In conversatlon w1th one of our past Mahseet commlssloners, who 
served on the com.m1ss1on for over a decade, he shared that dunng h1st1me on the COHIIIIISSIOH, 
they struggled w1th th1s same problem Over the years, 1f any of the b0d16S whrch are tasked wrth 
part1c1pat1on 1n MITSC farls to appomt a new comm1ss1oner 1n a tlmely manner, the Comm1ss1on 
can stall out In the months that we have had a full and actlvely engaged membershlp, the 
Comm1ss1on has functroned far more effectlvely and worked to satlsfy 1ts statutory dutles 
I thmk 1t should also be noted that a vers1on of the past COIIlII11SS1OI'l, wh1ch was strugghng w1th 
th1s same problem, wrote 1nto the MITSC by-laws a method to functlon under reduced quorum 1n 
an attempt to allev1ate the problem, but we are currently hes1tat1ng to nnplement that prov1s1on 
untrl we go through the process we are attempt1ng today and oﬁlcrally amend MITSC’s 
guldehnes 
I urge the Jud1c1ary Commrttee to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1679 and help 11‘I1pI'OVC the way 
the Commlsslon functlons and help us allev1ate th1s long, ongomg problem 
Thank you for your t1me today, I am w1ll1ng to answer any quest1ons 
Wohwon
