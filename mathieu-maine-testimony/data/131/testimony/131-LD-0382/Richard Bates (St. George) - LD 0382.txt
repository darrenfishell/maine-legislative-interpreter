To Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and other members of the Transportation Committee:
LD 382, HP0233   Resolve, Naming Portions of a Highway in St. George
On behalf of the St. George Select Board, I write to strongly support the proposal being heard by you on
February 21, to name portions of Route 131 in St. George in memory of two Knox County Deputies who
lost their lives in the line of duty.
As well as memorializing Deputy Sheriff Frank J. Buzynski and Deputy Sheriff Frank E. Ross, Jr., this
dedication will serve as a reminder to our community of the County Sheriff staffâ€™s continued commitment to
our safety and security.
I hope you will vote to recommend this proposal for adoption.
Respectfully submitted ,
Richard J.S. Bates
Select Board Chair
