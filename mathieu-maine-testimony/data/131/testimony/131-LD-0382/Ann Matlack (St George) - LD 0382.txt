Re:LD 382, Resolve, Naming Portions of a Highway in St. George
Good morning, Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and respected colleagues on the 
Transportation Committee. My name is Ann Matlack and I am here today to testify in support of LD 382, 
Resolve, Naming Portions of a Highway in St. George. I represent House District 43, which includes the 
communities of Cushing, Thomaston, South Thomaston, St George and part of Owls Head.
On the evening of September 4, 1959, Deputies Frank J. Buzynski and Frank E. Ross Jr. were pursuing a 
motor vehicle, suspected of OUI and Domestic Violence, south on Route 131. At approximately 11:00 
P.M., on a hill in the area of 1016 River Rd., the vehicle they were pursuing crashed and came to rest in 
the roadway. Dep. Buzynski, the operator of the patrol vehicle, took evasive actions and avoided the 
wreckage but was unable to gain control of the patrol vehicle before crashing into a tree on the property 
of Russell Reynolds, now St. George Pottery; the Deputies did pass at the scene.
I am suggesting that a two mile portion of Rt. 131 be dedicated to the Deputies, one mile dedicated to 
Buzynski and one mile dedicated to Ross. I am further suggesting that the portions start in the area of St. 
George Pottery and go one mile north for Deputy Buzynski and one mile south for Deputy Ross.
As you will note, this request is supported by both the towns of St. George and South Thomaston. Knox 
County Sheriff Patrick Polky can explain further our request for this designation.
I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
Respectfully,
Ann Matlack
