Testimony on 
L.D. 756, “An Act to Provide Funding for Positions in the Penobscot 
County Sheriff's Office”
& 
L.D. 799, “An Act to Fund Patrol Positions for the Penobscot County 
Sheriff's Office” 
Presented by 
Representative Richard H. Campbell 
District 19 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee 
Monday, March 13, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
l am State Representative Richard H. Campbell, and I proudly represent District 19, 
Eddington, Holden, and Orrington. lt is an honor to appear before you to speak in 
support of L.D. 756, “An Act to Provide Funding for Positions in the Penobscot 
County Sheriff's Office,” and L.D. 799, “An Act to Fund Patrol Positions for the 
Penobscot County Sheriff's Office.” 
It is imperative that funding be increased for the Penobscot County budget to 
maintain rural law enforcement sun/eillance due to the decreased coverage from the 
Maine State Police. In the past, rural law enforcement has been a combination of the 
Penobscot County Sheriff and the Maine State Police. With the State Police changing 
their mission, rural coverage is shifted, thus placing further burden on the Penobscot 
County Sheriff's Office. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. l ask that you please consider supporting 
both L.D. 756 and L.D. 799. 
District 19 Eddington, Holden and Orrington
