Testimony of Lt. Col.  Brian P. Scott
131st First Regular Session 
IN OPPOSITION OF LD 756 AN ACT TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR POSITIONS IN THE 
PENOBSCOT COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE  
Senator BeeBee-Center, Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, my name is 
Lt. Col. Brian P. Scott and I am here today to testify on behalf of the Maine State 
Police and the Department of Public Safety in Opposition to LD 756 AN ACT TO 
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR POSITIONS IN THE PENOBSCOT COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE.
THIS BILL ALONG WITH LD 799 ALSO BEING HEARD TODAY ARE AN ATTEMPT TO USE STATE 
FUNDING TO PAY FOR COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES IN PENOBSCOT COUNTY IN 
THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT 1.7 MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.  ALTHOUGH WE AGREE THAT 
LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES ARE STRETCHED VERY THIN THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF 
MAINE, WE STRONGLY DISAGREE THAT THIS IS THE WAY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  GENERALLY 
SPEAKING, COUNTY FUNDING IS FOR COUNTY OPERATIONS AND STATE FUNDING IS FOR 
STATE OPERATIONS.  NORMALLY THE STATE POLICE WOULD NOT WEIGH IN ON MATTERS 
THAT REGARD HOW THE COUNTY SHERIFF’S FUND THEIR OPERATIONS AS THEIR SOURCE OF 
FUNDING COMES FROM COUNTY TAXES UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE COUNTY 
COMMISSIONERS.  HOWEVER, IN THIS CASE THEIR FUNDING REQUEST DIRECTLY IMPACTS 
THE STATE POLICE SINCE IT COMPETES FOR THE FUNDING OUR AGENCY RECEIVES TO RUN 
ITS OPERATIONS.
WE HAVE BEEN IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST COUPLE 
DECADES ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO THAT WE COULD HIRE MORE RURAL PATROL 
TROOPERS.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HAD YOUR GENEROUS SUPPORT ON MANY OCCASIONS, 
YOUR APPROVALS HAVE FAILED TO BE FUNDED BY THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.  WE 
HAVE FEWER PATROL TROOPERS TODAY THAN WE DID IN THE 1990’S, WHILE THE 
PENOBSCOT COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT HAS SEEN THEIR HEADCOUNT MORE THAN 
45 COMMERCE DRIVE, SUITE 1, 42 STATE HOUSE STATION, AUGUSTA, ME 04333-0042 
TEL: (207) 624.7200    TTY: (207) 287.3659    FAX: (207) 287.3042DOUBLE DURING THAT TIME FRAME.  ALSO DURING THIS FRAME THE STATE POLICES’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE INCREASED GREATLY WHILE OUR CAPACITY HAS NOT.
THE STATE POLICE HAS PROVIDED OVER HALF OF THE RURAL PATROL COVERAGE IN 
PENOBSCOT COUNTY FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES UNDER A CALL SHARING AGREEMENT 
ALONG WITH MANY OTHER POLICE SERVICES LIKE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATIONS, TACTICAL 
TEAM RESPONSES, CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS, UNDER WATER RECOVERY SERVICES, CRIME LAB 
FORENSICS, CROWD MANAGEMENT TEAM SERVICES JUST TO NAME A FEW.  WE HAVE DONE 
THIS WITHOUT ANY COUNTY FUNDING, AS WE HAVE NEVER CHARGED THE COUNTIES FOR 
OUR SERVICES.  DUE TO OUR SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY ISSUES AND STAFFING CONCERNS, WE 
HAD TRIED TO RENEGOTIATE OUR CALL SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THE SHERIFF’S OFFICE, 
WHICH WE ATTEMPTED TO DO FOR SEVERAL YEARS WITHOUT SUCCESS.  WE FINALLY GOT 
TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAD TO ‘DRAW THE LINE IN THE SAND’ AND SAY THAT WE COULD 
NOT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OVER HALF OF THE COUNTIES RURAL PATROL ALONG WITH ALL 
THE OTHER SERVICES THAT NO OTHER POLICE AGENCY COULD PROVIDE IN THE COUNTY, 
ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE STATE OF MAINE FOR THAT MATTER.  SO, WE DID MANAGE 
TO STRIKE A NEW DEAL WHERE THE STATE POLICE STILL PROVIDES A LITTLE OVER A THIRD 
OF THE RURAL PATROL COVERAGE WHILE STILL COMMITTING TO ALL THE OTHER POLICE 
SERVICES IN THE COUNTY. 
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT WE ARE WALKING AWAY OR ABANDONING RURAL PATROL IN 
PENOBSCOT COUNTY OR THAT WE ARE DOING THIS WITHOUT ANY NOTICE TO THE COUNTY.  
THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE.  WE HAVE TRIED FOR YEARS TO ALTER THE CALL SHARING 
AGREEMENT AS WE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE TO KEEP OUR HEAD ABOVE WATER.  OVER 
THE YEARS WE HAVE MADE EVERY ATTEMPT TO FIND A SOLUTION TO OUR GROWING 
CAPACITY ISSUES.  WE HAVE ASKED FOR MORE FUNDING TO HIRE ADDITIONAL TROOPERS, 
WE HAVE PULLED ALL OF TROOPERS EXCEPT FOR ONE OFF OF TASK FORCES, WE HAVE 
STREAM LINED PROCESSES AND LEVERAGED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO MAKE THE 
RESOURCES THAT WE DO HAVE MORE EFFICIENT, WE HAVE HIRED CIVILIAN STAFF TO TAKE 
ON SOME OF THE DUTIES THAT WE IDENTIFIED DID NOT NEED TO BE OFFICERS TO DO, AND 
FINALLY WE HAVE RENEGOTIATED SEVERAL CALL SHARING AGREEMENTS TO BETTER ALIGN 
WITH OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT POLICE SERVICES. THE STATE POLICE IS 
COMMITTED TO PROVIDING RURAL PATROL IN PENOBSCOT COUNTY AND IS NOT GOING 
ANYWHERE!
HAVING SAID ALL OF THIS THE STATE POLICE HAS NEVER GONE TO THE COUNTY 
COMMISSIONERS AND ASKED FOR FUNDING FROM THE COUNTIES TO SUPPORT OUR 
OPERATIONS, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.  COUNTY 
FUNDING IS FOR COUNTY OPERATIONS!      
  
For these reasons, I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 756 and LD 799.
