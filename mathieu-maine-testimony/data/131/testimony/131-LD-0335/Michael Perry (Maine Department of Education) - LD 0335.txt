Senator Rafferty , Representative Brennan , and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 335, An Act to Improve Educator Certification Response Times , proposes to establish five 
Ed Specialist III positions within the D epartment of Education (D OE) dedicated to reducing 
response times for educator certification.  
The certification team  in the Department of Education is a part of the Office of Higher Education 
and Educator Suppor t Services  (OHEESS) .  In addition to certification evaluation and support, 
the office  also includes staff who focus on educator workforce development initiatives  as well as 
educator recognition and retention.   
OHEESS is  currently processing  incoming applications on a three -week turnaround. Candidates  
for certification submit a completed  application and relevant documents through the Maine 
Educational Informational System (ME IS). From there, certification evaluators review the 
application and send the applicant either a notice of successful certification (with conditional or 
full professi onal status)  or a letter detailing any area(s) in which the application does not yet 
conform with the requirements for certification .  
The certification team currently comprises of three Ed ucation  Specialist III positions, four Office 
Specialist positions, and an Office Manager. Ed ucation S pecialist IIIs evaluate applications while  
Office Specialist s handle incoming phone calls and emails about certification, criminal history 
background checks, and  fingerprinting.   These positions work collaboratively and meet daily  to 
discuss certification policy in general as well as specific applicant issues.   
The certification team also collaborates more broadly within OHEESS, helping workforce 
development staff understand certification questions and supporting applicants by connecting 
them with recruitment/retention resources .  Our office is often the first in teraction aspiring 
educators have with DOE; through the collaboration of the certification team with educator 
support staff , we can aid in the retention of these educators throughout their careers in Maine.  
Adding new positions to support educator certific ation and workforce development will thus 
serve Maine’s schools and students well.  Dictating the placement  and title  of the  new positions

proposed by LD 335 , however,  may restrict the DOE from balancing the composition of the 
Office of Higher Education and Educator Support Services to the evolving needs of Maine’s 
educators . The flexibility to assign these positions  to support certification applicants as well as 
educator workforce deve lopment, retention, and recognition activities  more broadly would allow 
OHEESS to support the field all the more in the years to come .  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 335 and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Michael Perry  
Acting Director of Higher Education & Educator Support  Services
