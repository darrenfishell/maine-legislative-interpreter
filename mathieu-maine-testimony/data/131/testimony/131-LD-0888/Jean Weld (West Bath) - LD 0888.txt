LD 888
I wish to weigh in supporting LD 888, which would allow courthouse canines to 
support witnesses.  I am a huge supporter of service and therapy dogs, having seen 
firsthand the miraculous effect they can have to calm and stabilize people, young and 
old, who have acute or traumatic anxiety and other issues.  There are a plethora of 
trained therapy dogs in Maine, and it should be simple enough to obtain dogs who 
have been trained in proven programs, like Therapy Dog International and others.  I 
truly hope the Committee will support this bill, which will also help bring more 
consistent and competent evidence to the matters pending before courts in our great 
state.  Thank you for considering my position.
