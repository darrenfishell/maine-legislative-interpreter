Case Summary
Procedural Posture
In a residential burglary case, the trial court allowed a "comfort 
dog" to sit next to the developmentally disabled adult victim as 
he testified. The jury convicted defendant of residential burglary. 
The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed defendant's 
conviction, holding that the dog's presence did not compromise 
defendant's right of cross-examination and that there was no 
prejudice. Defendant petitioned for review.
Overview
The Supreme Court concluded that the trial court acted within 
its broad discretion when it determined that the facility dog, 
which was provided by the prosecutor's office, was needed in 
light of the adult victim's severe developmental disabilities in 
order for the victim to testify adequately. There was no actual 
evidence on the record that the facility dog had the effect of 
distracting the jury, damaging the presumption of innocence, or 
otherwise tainting the proceedings. Defendant failed to establish 
that his fair trial rights were violated. Any prejudice that resulted 
from the dog's presence was minor and largely mitigated by a 
limiting instruction that the trial court gave. In contrast, the trial 
court ruled that the dog's presence would be helpful in reducing 
the victim's anxiety and eliciting his testimony, and no evidence 
to the contrary appeared on the record. While the possibility 
that a facility dog may incur undue sympathy calls for caution 
and a conscientious balancing of the benefits and the prejudice 
involved, the trial court balanced the competing factors 
appropriately.Outcome
The appellate court's judgment was affirmed.

The trial court is generally in the best position to perceive and

broad discretion to make a variety of trial management 
decisions, ranging from the mode and order of interrogating 
witnesses and presenting evidence, Wash. R. Evid. 611(a), to the 
admissibility of evidence, to provisions for the order and

HN2 [ ]  Standards of Review, Abuse of Discretion
A trial court abuses its discretion only if any of the following is 
true: (1) the decision is "manifestly unreasonable," that is, it falls 
outside the range of acceptable choices, given the facts and the 
applicable legal standard; (2) the decision is based on untenable 
grounds, that is, the factual findings are unsupported by the 
record; or (3) the decision is based on untenable reasons, that is, 
it is based on an incorrect standard or the facts do not meet the 
requirements of the correct standard.

HN3 [ ]  Fundamental Rights, Criminal Process
Where special courtroom procedures implicate constitutional 
rights, it is not the defendant's burden to prove that he or she 
has been prejudiced, but the prosecution's burden to prove that 
a special dispensation for a vulnerable witness is necessary. 
Washington does not require a showing of substantial need or 
compelling necessity. Trial courts have a unique perspective on 
the actual witness that an appellate court reviewing a cold record 
lacks; because the trial court is in the best position to analyze the 
actual necessity of a special dispensation, such as the presence 
of a support animal, the appellate court will not overrule the 
trial court's exercise of discretion unless the record fails to reveal 
the party's reasons for needing a support animal, or if the record 
indicates that the trial court failed to consider those reasons.

Opinion
En Banc
 [*543]  [**1194] 
¶1 WIGGINS, J. — This case requires us to determine whether a 
court may allow a witness to be accompanied by a comfort 
animal, here a dog, when testifying during trial. Generally, we 
give trial courts wide discretion to control trial proceedings, 
including the manner in which testimony will be presented. We 
recognize that some trial procedures, such as providing a child 
witness with a toy on the stand or shackling a defendant at trial, 
may risk coloring the perceptions  [*544]  of the jury. But trial 
courts are capable of addressing these risks. Here, the trial court 
acted within its broad discretion when it determined that Ellie, 
the facility dog provided by the prosecutor's office to the victim 
Douglas Lare, was needed in light of Lare's severe 
developmental disabilities in order for Lare to testify adequately. 
We affirm the Court of Appeals.
FACTS
I. Background
¶2 Douglas Lare suffers from significant developmental 
 [***2] disabilities, including cerebral palsy, Kallman Syndrome, 
and mild mental retardation. He has an IQ (intelligence 
quotient) of 65, and although he is 56 years old, he functions at 
a mental age ranging from 6 to 12 years old. 1 While he lives 
independently and has been working for the Veteran's Hospital 
for 23 years, Lare has difficulty with daily household activities, 
reading, and writing, and he uses a payee service to handle his 
1 The defense characterizes Lare's mental age as between two and a half 
years and eight and a half years. finances.
¶3 In 2005, Lare became romantically involved with his 
neighbor Alesha Lair. 2 Alesha was also dating the defendant, 
Timothy Dye, a fact that she did not reveal to Lare. In 2007, 
Alesha moved into Lare's apartment, along with Alesha's sister, 
her mother, and her mother's boyfriend. Alesha opened several 
credit cards in Lare's name and charged them to their limits, 
using them to buy herself and her family clothing, shoes, 
computers, beer, cigarettes, a DVD (digital video disk) player, 
and cell phones. Alesha also withdrew money from Lare's 
retirement account. 
¶4 When Alesha and her family moved out of Lare's apartment, 
Alesha used Lare's money to furnish her new apartment, and 
Dye moved in with Alesha. Alesha took a [*545]  key to Lare's 
apartment with her. In total, Alesha borrowed approximately $ 
42,000 against the credit cards in Lare's name and  [**1195]  
withdrew $ 59,000 from Lare's retirement account. 3
¶5 On January 19, 2008, Lare called 911 to report a DVD player 
and DVD missing. On January 24, Lare woke up to find Dye 
rummaging through his apartment. Dye asked Lare if he could 
take a DVD player and VCR (videocassette recorder), but Lare 
refused. Dye nonetheless took some DVDs and a shelving unit. 
The following day, Lare came home from work to find his front 
door propped open. His television, VCR, DVD player, 
microwave, and a collectible knife were missing. In a telephone 
interview with a police detective, Dye admitted that he had 
pawned Lare's DVD player but claimed that Lare had 
voluntarily offered it to him. After the  [***4] detective stopped 
the recording, Dye told her that “he didn't have anything to 
worry about because his name wasn't on any of the pawn slips 
and so there was no way to pin it on him.” Report of 
Proceedings (RP) (Dec. 6, 2010) at 6.
¶6 After the burglaries, Lare became very fearful. He installed 
three locks on his front door and began sleeping with mace, a 
frying pan, and two knives in his bedroom for protection.
II. Trial and Appellate Proceedings
¶7 The State charged Dye with residential burglary in 
connection with the January 24 incident, alleging as an 
aggravator that Lare was a vulnerable victim.
¶8 During Lare's defense interview, he was accompanied by a 
2 Because of the similarity of Lair and Lare's names, Alesha Lair is 
hereinafter referred to by her first name. No  [***3] disrespect is 
intended. 
3 Alesha later pleaded guilty to theft in the first degree with the 
aggravating circumstance that Lare was a particularly vulnerable victim. 
Alesha's guilt is not at issue in this case and is not further discussed. 178 Wn.2d 541, *541 ; 309 P.3d 1192, **1192 ; 2013 Wash. LEXIS 767, ***767

facility dog, 4 Ellie. Ellie is a golden retriever used by [*546]  the 
King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office to comfort children 
who are giving statements and testimony. Ellie was trained by, 
and lives with, the prosecutor at Dye's trial.
¶9 Lare then requested Ellie's presence during his testimony at 
trial. The State moved to allow Ellie to accompany Lare during 
his testimony, arguing that Lare needed Ellie's assistance 
because of his “significant anxiety regarding his upcoming 
testimony” and because he “functions at the level of a child and 
is fearful of the defendant.” Clerk's Papers (CP) at 104. The 
State further added during a pretrial hearing that Lare was a 
“complete dog fan” and that Ellie had provided Lare 
“tremendous comfort” during the previous interview. RP (Nov. 
18, 2010) at 28.
¶10 Dye's counsel said that she did not object to Ellie's presence 
“if [Dye] gets to hold his baby while he is testifying,” arguing 
that “the prejudice is extreme, allowing the alleged victim in this 
case to pet the dog.” Id. The trial court disagreed, noting that 
Lare was a “developmentally disabled individual who has … 
significant emotional trauma.” Id. at 29. The court found that 
Ellie would be 
very unobtrusive, will just simply be next to the individual, 
not be laying [sic] in his lap, and if we can accommodate 
somebody who has a developmental disability when they're 
testifying in the courtroom I think it's appropriate 
 [***6] to do so. 
Id. The court then suggested that if Dye had a similar disability, 
the court might be receptive to allowing Dye to hold his baby 
on the stand.
¶11 Dye's counsel also argued that Ellie's presence might 
inflame Dye's allergies or distract the jury. The court offered to 
accommodate Dye's allergies so long as he could provide 
medical documentation of them. There is no indication in the 
record that Dye did so.
¶12 At trial, Ellie sat with Lare during his testimony and 
accompanied him to the restroom. Lare also fed Ellie 
treats [*547]  and used Ellie as a table while reading an exhibit. 
Ellie's presence is not otherwise indicated in the record except 
for her introduction at the beginning of Lare's testimony:
 [**1196]  Q. … Who's your friend there with you?
4 The defense characterizes Ellie as a “comfort dog,” Pet'r's Suppl. Br. 
at 1, a “therapy dog[ ],” Pet. for Review at 8, or a “support dog,” Br. of 
Amicus Curiae Wash. Defender Ass'n & The Defender Ass'n at 1. 
However, the Court of Appeals adopted the term “‘facility dog,’” State 
v. Dye, 170 Wn. App. 340, 343 n.5, 283 P.3d 1130 (2012),  [***5] and 
we do the same. A. This is Ellie.
Q. And why is Ellie there with you?
A. Ellie is to help me and to make it easier for me. And I 
have treats here. 
RP (Dec. 1, 2010) at 10. At the end of the trial, the court 
instructed the jury not to “make any assumptions or draw any 
conclusions based on the presence of this service dog.” CP at 
53.
¶13 The jury convicted Dye of residential burglary but did not 
find that Lare was a vulnerable victim. State v. Dye, 170 Wn. 
App. 340, 344, 283 P.3d 1130 (2012).  [***7] Dye appealed his 
conviction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, 
holding that Ellie's presence did not compromise Dye's right of 
cross-examination, that the prosecutor did not improperly give 
Lare a gift, that the trial court properly balanced Lare's special 
needs against the possibility of prejudice, and that there was no 
prejudice in the first instance. Id. at 346-48. Dye appealed on the 
ground that Ellie's presence violated his right to due process and 
a fair trial.
ANALYSIS
I. Standard of Review
WA[1] [ ] [1] ¶14 HN1 [ ] The trial court is generally in the 
best position to perceive and structure its own proceedings. 
Accordingly, a trial court has broad discretion to make a variety 
of trial management decisions, ranging from “the mode and 
order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence,” 5 to 
the [*548]  admissibility of evidence, 6 to provisions for the 
order and security of the courtroom. 7 In order to effectuate the 
trial court's discretion, we grant the trial court broad discretion: 
even if we disagree with the trial court, we will not reverse its 
decision unless that decision is “manifestly unreasonable or 
based on untenable grounds or untenable reasons.” In re 
Marriage of Littlefield, 133 Wn.2d 39, 46-47, 940 P.2d 1362 (1997).
WA[2] [ ] [2] ¶15 Allegations that a ruling violated the 
defendant's right to a fair trial does not change the standard of 
review. For example, we have reviewed for abuse of discretion a 
trial court's ruling requiring the defendant to attend trial in 
shackles. State v. Finch, 137 Wn.2d 792, 852, 975 P.2d 967 
(1999); State v. Hartzog, 96 Wn.2d 383, 401, 635 P.2d 694 (1981). 
We have consistently reviewed courtroom procedures—
allegedly prejudicial or not—for abuse of discretion standard, 
and Dye presents no reason for us to depart from that standard

now.
II. Abuse of Discretion
WA[3] [ ] [3] ¶16 HN2 [ ] A trial court abuses its discretion 
only if any of the following is true:
(1) The decision is “manifestly unreasonable,” that is, it falls 
“outside the range of acceptable choices, given the facts and the 
applicable legal standard”;
(2) The decision is “based on untenable grounds,” that is, 
“the factual findings are unsupported by the record”; or
(3) The decision is “based on untenable reasons,” that is, it is 
“based on an incorrect standard or the facts do not meet the 
requirements of the correct standard.”
Littlefield, 133 Wn.2d at 47. As a preliminary matter, the 
“manifestly  [***9] unreasonable” and “untenable reasons” 
tests require us to determine a legal standard to use.
 [*549] A. Applicable legal standard
¶17 No controlling authority in Washington decides whether a 
dog may accompany a witness during testimony. We have found 
only two on-point published cases from other jurisdictions: 
People v. Tohom, 969 N.Y.S.2d 123, 109 A.D.3d 253 (N.Y. App. 
Div. 2013), and People v. Spence, 212 Cal. App. 4th 478, 151 Cal. 
Rptr. 3d 374 (2012). In both cases, the witness at issue was a 
young girl who had been raped by her father. Tohom, 969 
N.Y.S.2d 123;  [**1197]  Spence, 212 Cal. App. 4th at 485. The 
witness in Spence was crying and upset as she recounted the 
events to health workers. 212 Cal. App. 4th at 485-86. 
Accordingly, the prosecutor moved for a “therapy dog” to be 
present on the witness stand with the victim, citing concerns 
that the witness might have an “emotional meltdown and refuse 
to testify.” Id. at 512. The trial court granted the motion, ruling 
that “it was reasonably probable that testifying might be an 
intimidating situation for [the witness],” id., and that the dog 
was known to be nondisruptive. The appellate court agreed, 
deferring without analysis to the trial court's “implied 
 [***10] findings of necessity.” 8 Id. at 518. Similarly, in Tohom, 
the witness was experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress 
disorder and did not feel comfortable testifying because her 
family members blamed her for the situation. 969 N.Y.S.2d at 
126-27. The trial court permitted the dog to be present during 
the witness's testimony and the appellate division affirmed, 
8 Defense counsel suggests that the result might also be attributed to a 
California statute allowing vulnerable victims to appear accompanied by 
support persons. CAL. PENAL CODE § 868.5. However, the court in 
Spence, 212 Cal. App. 4th 478, did not rely on this statute. Furthermore, 
Washington has a similar support person statute. RCW 7.69A.030(3).citing the trial court's discretion to “fashion[ ] an appropriate 
measure to address a testifying child witness's emotional or 
psychological stress, based upon the particular needs of that 
child.” Id. at 132-33.
¶18 The Court of Appeals has held that a child witness may 
hold a doll during testimony. In State v. Hakimi, 124 Wn. App. 
15, 18,  [*550]  98 P.3d 809 (2004), the two witnesses were 
young girls who had been allegedly molested by their babysitter, 
Morteza Hakimi. Hakimi  [***11] moved to prohibit the 
witnesses from carrying a doll to the witness stand. The trial 
court heard argument on the motion, including testimony by an 
expert in child interviewing that “girls in particular in the 9-year-
old age range may find security and comfort by holding a toy 
while answering questions posed to them during examination at 
trial.” Id. at 21. The trial court weighed the interests of the 
witnesses against the potential prejudice to Hakimi and denied 
Hakimi's motion, stating that 
“the doll will not be the subject of any questioning . … 
[C]hildren do present different issues and different 
considerations in terms of being witnesses in different 
cases. They have a peculiar need to find some security in 
an otherwise insecure setting, I suspect.
“I don't think the doll unduly prejudices, to the extent it 
prejudices anyone at all; so I will allow it.” 
Id. at 20. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, joining 
the many other jurisdictions that have permitted child witnesses 
to hold a doll, toy, or other comfort item on the witness stand 9 
or to be accompanied by a parent, victim advocate, or other 
trusted individual. 10

 [*551]  [**1198] 
WA[4] [ ] [4] ¶19 Upon examining those cases that have 
allowed a child witness to use a comfort item or support person, 
a few important similarities and differences become clear. First, 
the cases are in largely universal agreement that abuse of 
discretion is the correct standard. See, e.g., State v. Perovich, 2001 
SD 96, 632 N.W.2d 12, 17-18 (“A cold record invariably lacks 
the emotion of the occurrence below. It is obvious that a trial of 
this type takes its toll on both witnesses and the parties. 
Whether or not these emotions amount to circumstances that 
create an unfair trial is best addressed within the discretion of 
the trial court.”).
¶20 Second, many of these cases involved highly egregious facts. 
See, e.g., Holmes v. United States, 84 U.S. App. D.C. 168, 171 F.2d 
1022, 1023 (1949)  [***14] (“The child was a little girl of nine 
who had been subjected to a most terrible and horrifying 
experience [being raped, beaten and disfigured, and left 
unconscious under some leaves] to a degree which might well 
influence the balance of her life.”).
¶21 Third, the courts are split on whether the prosecution must 
prove that the special measure is necessary to secure the 
witness's testimony. A number of courts have declined to 
require that the prosecution make a showing of necessity, 
instead putting the onus on the defendant to prove prejudice or 
impropriety. See, e.g., State v. Dickson, 337 S.W.3d 733, 743 (Mo. 
Ct. App. 2011) (“[T]here was nothing to suggest that the toys 
were used to engender the sympathy of the jurors; no reference 
to the teddy bears was made in the presence of the jury; and the 
witnesses were testifying about traumatic events.”); State v. 
Powell, 318 S.W.3d 297, 303-04 (Mo. Ct. App. 2010) (“There is 
nothing to suggest that the stuffed animals were merely an 
attempt to cater to the emotional sympathy of the jurors. No 
reference [*552]  was made to the teddy bears by any of the 
witnesses or counsel in the presence of the jury.”); Sperling v. 
State, 924 S.W.2d 722, 726 (Tex. App. 1996)  [***15] (“With 
nothing more in the record, we cannot conclude that the teddy 
bear constituted demonstrative evidence which engendered 
sympathy in the minds and hearts of the jury, validated the 
child-victim's unimpeached credibility, or deprived appellant of 
his constitutional right of confrontation.”).
¶22 Two states explicitly require the prosecution to show that a 
special measure is necessary to facilitate the witness's testimony. 
Delaware has adopted a “substantial need” standard, Gomez v. 
State, 25 A.3d 786, 798-99 (Del. 2011), and Hawaii has adopted a 
Commonwealth v. Pankraz, 382 Pa. Super. 116, 125-26, 554 A.2d 974 
(1989); State v. Dompier, 94 Or. App. 258, 261, 764 P.2d 979 (1988); State 
v. Johnson, 38 Ohio App. 3d 152, 154, 528 N.E.2d 567 (1986); Brooks v. 
State, 24 Md. App. 334, 342, 330 A.2d 670 (1975); Rodgers v. State, 30 
Tex. Ct. App. 510, 528-29, 17 S.W. 1077 (1891).similar “compelling necessity” standard. State v. Palabay, 9 Haw. 
App. 414, 417, 844 P.2d 1 (1992).
¶23 Finally, several states have shied away from an explicit 
necessity test but nevertheless relied on a record that clearly 
indicated that the witness would have difficulty testifying in the 
absence of the comfort item or support person. See Hakimi, 124 
Wn. App. at 21 (expert in child interviewing testified that doll 
could put young girls at ease); Perovich, 632 N.W.2d at 17 
(witness refused to come to the stand when called, remaining in 
the back of the courtroom and crying); State v. Cliff, 116 Idaho 
921, 923, 782 P.2d 44 (Ct. App. 1989) (child had  [***16] dry 
heaves while testifying at preliminary hearing and had to be 
taken to restroom); State v. Dompier, 94 Or. App. 258, 260, 764 
P.2d 979 (1988) (witness began crying on the stand and was 
unable to answer questions until foster mother was permitted to 
enter the stand with her); Brooks v. State, 24 Md. App. 334, 341, 
330 A.2d 670 (1975) (witness “‘virtually fainted after being 
removed from the courtroom’”).
¶24 In a different vulnerable-witness setting, Washington and 
United States Supreme Court jurisprudence has required a 
showing of necessity to allow testimony via closed-circuit 
television. In Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 840, 110 S. Ct. 
3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990), the prosecution [*553]  sought 
to have the witness—a young girl who had been allegedly 
molested by the owner of her kindergarten—examined and 
cross-examined in a separate room while those in the courtroom 
watched on video. The Court held that in order to overcome the 
defendant's confrontation clause right of “face-to-face 
confrontation,” the trial court must make a case-specific finding 
of necessity. Id. at 855-56. That is, the trial court must hear 
evidence and “find that the child witness  [**1199]  would be 
traumatized, not by the  [***17] courtroom generally, but by 
the presence of the defendant.” Id. at 856. We adopted the same 
rule in State v. Foster, 135 Wn.2d 441, 469, 957 P.2d 712 (1998), 
agreeing with the Court's reasoning in full.
WA[5] [ ] [5] ¶25 Our confrontation clause analysis in Foster, 
135 Wn.2d at 466-70, and our fair trial analysis in Finch, 137 
Wn.2d 843-46, show that HN3 [ ] where special courtroom 
procedures implicate constitutional rights, it is not the 
defendant's burden to prove that he or she has been prejudiced, 
but the prosecution's burden to prove that a special 
dispensation for a vulnerable witness is necessary. The present 
context is no different. However, we do not require a showing 
of “substantial need” or “compelling necessity” like Delaware, 
in Gomez, 25 A.3d at 798-99, or Hawaii, in Palabay, 9 Haw. App. 
at 417. Trial courts have a unique perspective on the actual 
witness that an appellate court reviewing a cold record lacks; 
because the trial court is in the best position to analyze the 
actual necessity of a special dispensation, we will not overrule 
the trial court's exercise of discretion unless the record fails to 
178 Wn.2d 541, *550 ; 309 P.3d 1192, **1197 ; 2013 Wash. LEXIS 767, ***13
Page 8 of 10
reveal the party's reasons for needing a support animal or if the 
record indicates that the trial  [***18] court failed to consider 
those reasons. Using this standard, we now analyze whether the 
trial court's decision was based on untenable grounds, based on 
untenable reasons, or manifestly unreasonable.
B. Untenable grounds
WA[6-8] [ ] [6-8] ¶26 A trial court's decision is based on 
untenable grounds “if the factual findings are unsupported by 
the [*554]  record.” Littlefield, 133 Wn.2d at 46-47. Here, the 
trial court found that Lare was a “developmentally disabled 
individual who has … had some significant emotional trauma” 
and that in contrast, Dye was “under no disability whatsoever.” 
RP (Nov. 18, 2010) at 29. These findings are well supported by 
the record. Lare's sister testified as to the nature and extent of 
Lare's conditions. Lare himself testified to how the burglaries 
made him feel “very vulnerable and very scared.” RP (Dec. 1, 
2010) at 41.
¶27 The trial court also found that Ellie would be “very 
unobtrusive, will just simply be next to the individual, not be 
lying in his lap. …” RP (Nov. 18, 2010) at 29. Indeed, Ellie's 
conduct at trial supports the trial court's finding. The record 
does not indicate that Ellie ever disrupted proceedings, left 
Lare's side, or made any gestures toward Dye (growling, for 
 [***19] instance) that would have made him look dangerous or 
untrustworthy. Because the trial court's decision to allow Ellie to 
be present was predicated on findings based in the record, the 
trial court did not rely on untenable grounds.
C. Untenable reasons
¶28 A trial court's decision is made for untenable reasons if “it is 
based on an incorrect standard or the facts do not meet the 
requirements of the correct standard.” Littlefield, 133 Wn.2d at 
47. Under the standard discussed above, the trial court's 
“implicit” finding of necessity was sufficient. Dye, 170 Wn. App. 
at 348. The trial court was made aware of Lare's “significant 
anxiety regarding his upcoming testimony,” as well as his fear of 
Dye. CP at 104. The trial court expressly relied on Lare's 
“significant emotional trauma” and “developmental disability,” 
RP (Nov. 18, 2010) at 29, when it allowed Ellie to accompany 
Lare on the witness stand. The trial court clearly understood 
that Ellie was needed in order to facilitate Lare's testimony, in 
light of his mental state. The trial court did everything but 
explicitly state on the record that Lare would not testify but 
for [*555]  Ellie's presence, and the failure to do so does not 
constitute error.  [***20] Our precedent does not call for magic 
words, but for “‘a hearing with a record evidencing the reasons 
for the action taken … .’” Hartzog, 96 Wn.2d at 401 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. 
Hartzog, 26 Wn. App. 576, 588-89, 615 P.2d 480 (1980)). 
Because the trial court held a hearing on the permissibility of 
Ellie's presence, and because the record showed why Ellie's 
presence was needed to facilitate Lare's testimony, the trial court 
did not rely on untenable reasons.
 [**1200]  D. Manifestly unreasonable
¶29 A manifestly unreasonable decision is one that is “outside 
the range of acceptable choices, given the facts and the 
applicable legal standard … .” Littlefield, 133 Wn.2d at 47 (citing 
State v. Rundquist, 79 Wn. App. 786, 793, 905 P.2d 922 (1995)). 
As we have noted above, the applicable legal standard gives 
broad discretion to the trial court, and the trial court based its 
decision on Lare's vulnerable mental state. Furthermore, there is 
no actual evidence on the record that Ellie had the effect of 
distracting the jury, damaging the presumption of Dye's 
innocence, or otherwise tainting the proceedings. Dye argues 
that Ellie impermissibly bolstered  [***21] Lare's credibility by 
giving Lare's testimony an “aura of truth and sympathy,” Pet'r's 
Suppl. Br. at 5-6; that Ellie made Lare look pitiful to the jury 
and “presupposed the victimhood of the complainant,” Pet. for 
Review at 13; that jurors may have believed Lare's stress was 
because he was telling the truth; that the trial prosecutor was 
Ellie's trainer and might have given Ellie conscious or 
unconscious behavioral cues; and that a defendant or defense 
counsel might have allergies or be uncomfortable around dogs, 
thereby impeding the defendant's right of cross-examination. 
None of these theories has any basis in the record. For example, 
far from being discouraged by Ellie's presence, Dye's counsel 
conducted an extensive cross-examination of Lare and 
discredited him by exposing numerous inconsistencies [*556] . 
See RP (Dec. 1, 2010) at 43, 61, 69-70, 72, 80, 87, 101, 120, 126-
27.
¶30 It is the responsibility of a party alleging error to create a 
record of that error. If Dye's counsel had seen Ellie jump on 
Lare, make a defensive posture toward Dye, or engage in other 
prejudicial behavior, she could have noted such behavior for the 
record or even asked the court to remove Ellie from the witness 
 [***22] stand momentarily. Counsel did not. This court is not 
in a position to speculate about what might have happened at 
trial.
¶31 Furthermore, whatever subconscious bias may have befallen 
the jury was cured by the trial court's limiting instruction, which 
cautioned the jury not to “make any assumptions or draw any 
conclusions based on the presence of this service dog.” 11 CP at 
11 Dye alleges that the limiting instruction was an improper judicial 
comment on the evidence because referring to Ellie as a “service dog” 
178 Wn.2d 541, *553 ; 309 P.3d 1192, **1199 ; 2013 Wash. LEXIS 767, ***17
Page 9 of 10
53. HN4 [ ] Juries are presumed to follow instructions absent 
evidence to the contrary. State v. Kirkman, 159 Wn.2d 918, 928, 
155 P.3d 125 (2007). No such evidence appears on the record 
here. The constitutional role of the jury prevents us from 
presuming—on the force of a bare allegation—that the jury 
“[made] a decision based on the dog's reaction and demeanor, 
not the witness's. …” Br. of Amicus Curiae Wash. Defender 
Ass'n & The Defender Ass'n at 14. And our own precedent 
compels us to respect the trial court's decision: whether or not 
we might have conducted the trial differently, we cannot say the 
trial court acted in a manifestly unreasonable manner.
III. Conclusion
¶32 Dye has failed to establish that his fair trial rights were 
violated. Any prejudice that resulted from Ellie's presence 
 [*557] was minor and largely mitigated by the limiting 
instruction that the trial court gave. In contrast, the trial court 
ruled that Ellie's presence would be helpful in reducing Lare's 
anxiety and eliciting his testimony, and no evidence to the 
contrary appears on the record. Both the general trend of courts 
to allow special procedural accommodations for child witnesses 
and the deference built into the abuse of discretion standard 
require us to respect the trial court's decision in how to structure 
its own proceedings. While the possibility that a facility 
 [***24] dog may incur undue sympathy calls for caution and a 
conscientious  [**1201]  balancing of the benefits and the 
prejudice involved, the trial court balanced the competing 
factors appropriately. The trial court did not abuse its discretion, 
and the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

implied that Lare was disabled.  [***23] He argues that Lare's 
perceptions and cognitive abilities were central questions of fact for the 
jury and that implying that Lare was disabled suggested the answers to 
those questions for the jury. However, the only element that Lare's 
disability weighed on was the vulnerable-victim aggravator sought by 
the State, CP at 59, and the jury did not find that Lare was a vulnerable 
victim. Therefore, even if the court's reference to Ellie as a “service 
dog” presupposed Lare's disability, there was no prejudice.¶34 Some symbols convey such a powerful message about the 
criminal defendant's probable guilt that we bar their use. For 
example, we bar the government from forcing the defendant to 
appear at a jury trial in jail garb. State v. Finch, 137 Wn.2d 792, 
844-45, 975 P.2d 967 (1999) (collecting cases). Similarly, we 
generally bar the government from forcing the defendant to 
appear at trial in shackles. Id.;  [***25] see also, e.g., Illinois v. 
Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1970). As 
this court recently stated regarding an electronic presentation by 
a prosecutor, “prejudicial images may sway a jury in ways that 
words cannot.” In re Pers. Restraint of Glasmann, 175 Wn.2d 696, 
707, 286 P.3d 673  [*558]  (2012) (citing State v. Gregory, 158 
Wn.2d 759, 866-67, 147 P.3d 1201 (2008)).
¶35 The facility dog, Ellie, was a powerful symbol in this case. 
Indeed, that's why she was so important for Mr. Lare: her mere 
presence conveyed a deeply reassuring, yet silent, message of 
comfort, security, and support. I join the majority in concluding 
that the State showed the need for such a powerful symbol to 
assist Mr. Lare in testifying given the particular facts of this case.
¶36 But given the undisputed power of the dog's symbolic 
message, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that that is 
the end of the trial court's job. Instead, to maintain the 
symbolism of fairness in the courtroom, additional measures 
must be taken. Those measures must ensure that the jury 
decides the case based solely on the facts, rather than based—
even in part—on the facility dog's silent message about Mr. 
Lare's status as  [***26] a sympathetic and truthful victim who 
is worthy of support.
¶37 The defense in this case did not suggest any additional 
measures, except for what appears to be the sarcastic comment 
that Mr. Lare could testify with Ellie if Mr. Dye could testify 
holding his baby. But the trial court should have considered 
other measures to neutralize the facility dog's powerful 
symbolism in support of the alleged victim. See, e.g., State v. 
Rodriguez, 146 Wn.2d 260, 271-72, 45 P.3d 541 (2002) (listing 
steps that court should take before permitting an inmate 
witness—for either side—to testify in shackles). 12 For example, 
if the State's key witness is accompanied by a facility dog, then 
the defendant or the defendant's key witness might be 
accompanied by a facility dog. The purpose of the second 
facility dog need not be to provide symbolic support; its sole 
purpose could be to [*559]  symbolize a level playing field in 
the courtroom. Alternatively, the witness might have been 
12 The defense's failure to request equalizing  [***27] measures, despite 
initially objecting, seems similar to a failure to request a curative 
instruction despite raising an objection. The failure to request a curative 
instruction does not waive the claim of error, e.g., State v. Claflin, 38 Wn. 
App. 847, 849 n.2, 690 P.2d 1186 (1984), and the failure to request an 
equalizing measure should not waive the claim of error here, either.

seated with the dog shielded from view before the jury entered 
the courtroom. The trial court should also be open to other 
suggestions in the future for neutralizing a facility dog's 
powerful symbolism.
¶38 The majority asserts that the court's instruction that the jury 
should ignore the dog in the room sufficed to guard against any 
possible prejudice to Mr. Dye. Majority at 556. I disagree. The 
majority bases this conclusion on the general rule that jurors are 
presumed to follow their instructions. State v. Emery, 174 Wn.2d 
741, 766, 278 P.3d 653 (2012) (citing State v. Anderson, 153 Wn. 
App. 417, 220 P.3d 1273 (2009)).
 [**1202] 
¶39 That presumption, however, does not always apply. The 
courts recognize the reality that jurors are likely unable to follow 
certain instructions, like an instruction to ignore a codefendant's 
confession. Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 
20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968). In fact, this court has noted that 
“[prejudicial] imagery” in particular “may be very difficult to 
overcome with an  [***28] instruction.” Glasmann, 175 Wn.2d 
at 707 (citing Gregory, 158 Wn.2d at 866-67). Thus, the 
presumption that jurors follow instructions is especially 
inapplicable where the challenged procedure—here, the 
presence of the adorable dog Ellie—is a procedure that works 
only because it provides such powerful symbolism.
¶40 Finally, the majority asserts that adding a claim that the 
challenged ruling “violated the defendant's right to a fair trial 
does not change the standard of review” and that the standard 
of review applicable to evidentiary errors still applies. Majority at 
548. I agree that violation of a state rule concerning the conduct 
of the trial and control of the courtroom does not necessarily 
change the analysis from [*560]  evidentiary error to 
constitutional error. 13 But a constitutional issue is presented 
when an error in the conduct of the trial—even one that would 
be subject to abuse of discretion review if analyzed solely under 
state court rules—also violates a constitutional right. 14 The

(1990);  [***29] Tinsley v. Borg, 895 F.2d 520, 530 (9th Cir. 1990) 
(incorrect evidentiary rulings ordinarily not a basis for constitutional 
claim); United States ex rel. Lee v. Flannigan, 884 F.2d 945, 953 (7th Cir. 
1989) (claim based on “other crime” evidence not cognizable because 
error did not violate constitutional right to fundamental fairness).
14 E.g., Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 6, 87 S. Ct. 785, 17 L. Ed. 2d 690 
(1967) (evidentiary error of admitting men's shorts with reddish brown 
stain amounted to constitutional error warranting federal habeas corpus 
relief because state knew at time of trial that the stain was not blood 
and, hence, conviction obtained by knowing use of false evidence); 
White v. White, 925 F.2d 287 (9th Cir. 1991) (granting habeas corpus 
relief based on petitioner's inability to confront adverse witnesses at 
parole revocation hearing); Rivera v. Dir., Dep't of Corr., 915 F.2d 280, defense raised such an issue here. E.g., Pet'r's Suppl. Br. at 3-4 
(raising fair trial right under Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments 
to the United States Constitution).
¶45 Given the strength of the State's evidence in this case, 
however, any error involving Ellie was certainly harmless, under 
any standard of review. I therefore concur.
