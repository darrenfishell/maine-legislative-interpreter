LD 888
I am in support of LD 888, "An Act to Allow Use of Courthouse Facility Dogs by 
Criminal Justice Agencies for Criminal Justice Purposes".  As a therapy dog owner 
and evaluator, I know first hand the value and importance of therapy dogs to persons 
who have been through or are going through traumatic experiences, including first 
responders, children with learning disabilities, and others in stressful situations.  
Research has show that the presence of a trained therapy dog can lower blood 
pressure levels of those interacting with the dog.  The presence of a therapy dog in an 
educational setting can improve the reading fluency of children having difficulty 
reading.  Their presence in a courtroom setting would also be a calming factor.  I 
support the passage of LD 888.
