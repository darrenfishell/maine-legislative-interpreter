SHIRA BURNS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
“An Act to Allow Use of Courthouse Facility Dogs by Criminal Justice 
Agencies for Criminal Justice Purposes ” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Public Hearing Date: March 15, 2023 
Testimony in Support of LD 888 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary. My name is Shira Burns and I represent the Maine Prosecutors Association and am here 
to testify in support of LD 888. 
There is no Way denying that being part of some legal proceedings can be terrifying, unnerving and 
in some situations traumatic. The courtroom can be a very cold, antiquated place that leads people 
to be fearful of the business that takes place inside. It is time we start employing every resource we 
have available to help people go through these traumatic experiences. 
LD 888 is a tool that is in place in many other jurisdictions as it recognizes that there is an unmet 
need and there are recourses available to help accommodate that need. The language is broad 
enough to allow the judicial officer the discretion in deciding if it is appropriate to use a courthouse 
facility dog team in a speciﬁc legal proceeding. Many factors would contribute to this balancing test 
including, but not limited to, if one person using a courthouse facility dog team would be 
detrimental to any other person involved in the proceedings. These are all decisions that would be 
leﬂ; up to our judicial officers in making the ﬁnal call. 
With the prevalence of domestic vio lence, sexual assault, and child abuse in our State, a courthouse 
facility dog team can help make the difference for that vulnerable person going through the court 
system. 
For these reasons, the Maine Prosecutors Association is in support of LD 888.
