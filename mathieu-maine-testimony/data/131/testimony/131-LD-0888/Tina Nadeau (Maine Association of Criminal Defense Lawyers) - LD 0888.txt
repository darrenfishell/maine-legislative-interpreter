Box 17642 Portland, ME 04112-8642 (207) 523-9869      mainemacdl@gmail.com  March 15, 2023   Senator Anne Carney, Chair Representative Matt Moonen, Chair Committee on Judiciary  100 State House Station, Room 438 Augusta, ME 04333   RE: LD 888: An Act to Allow Use of Courthouse Facility Dogs by Criminal Justice Agencies for Criminal Justice Purposes   Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee:   I am here today on behalf of MACDL to testify in opposition to LD 888. Our concern is simple: passage of this bill would undermine the accused’s Constitutional right to a fair trial.  To be clear, if any witness in any proceeding has their own service dog for a disability recognized under the ADA, they are allowed the use of that service animal in the courthouse and in the courtroom. This is not what this bill proposes.  Instead, this bill is intended to allow a “courthouse facility dog” to comfort “vulnerable witnesses” at any time during court proceedings—specifically criminal proceedings.  The use of a comfort dog during testimony or even if accompanying the witness in the courtroom to observe proceedings would be a distraction for everyone involved, including the witnesses themselves and members of the jury. It would potentially—nay, likely—endear the jury to the witness, prejudicing the defense.   The human response to dogs is one of tenderness and affection—jurors are instructed to use ration and reason when evaluating testimony. Unfortunately, jurors are also human—and the image of a crying child or alleged victim of domestic violence stroking a sweet pup, and the pup responding to that distress by comforting the witness, would affect just about any person’s heart. Though this bill may be well-intended, its unintended effects would be disastrous to the appearance of impartiality and fairness in criminal trials.  Can testifying in a criminal trial against the accused be a traumatic—or, at the very least, distressing—experience? Of course, it could be. (So is being accused of a crime.) However, for hundreds of years, our Constitution has demanded that the accused have the right to confront the witnesses against them—not witnesses softened and made more sympathetic by a dog. If the State seeks to imprison someone, then they must present credible and reliable witness testimony to the jury—testimony that is not buttressed by a sympathetic courthouse facility dog. The jury is not supposed to make any decision based on sympathy. Adding a dog to the mix just muddies the waters.   My understanding is that this bill comes from a request by the Aroostook County District Attorney’s Office. That office has consistently opposed the creation of any treatment court (“Drug Court”) in its jurisdiction for years, but yet has the time to prioritize comfort dogs for witnesses. I question the priorities of that office, given the County’s desperate substance use problems, the sharp increase in overdoses, the terrible overcrowding at its jail, and its 
troubling and significant backlog of cases (up more than 82 percent over pre-pandemic numbers, as of March 10, 2023—the third highest county increase in the State). There is a fiscal cost to this proposal, to be sure, and in the context of the overwhelming needs in the criminal legal system in Aroostook County and across Maine alone, this bill should not pass.  If any DA’s Office wants to use a comfort dog within their own offices when working with complaining witnesses and others, away from the public eye, and if the county is willing to pay for such a dog, I say: Godspeed. If that same DA’s Office wants to have the court authorize the use of such a dog for “quiet companionship” for any “vulnerable” (by whose definition?) witness, this is an untenable proposition. The judge’s cautioning to the jurors proposed by the bill would not remedy this profound intrusion into the jury’s ability to be fair and impartial.   Lastly, the proponents of this bill may say: “Well, ‘vulnerable witness’ could include anyone from the defense side. Even the defendant himself!” This ignores another Constitutional principle: the defense does not have to prove anything in a criminal prosecution. The burden to prove guilt beyond all reasonable doubt lies on the prosecution alone. In reality, very few defense witnesses are called to testify and the accused hardly ever testifies on their own behalf. The reality is that the defense would not benefit from these comfort animals being accessible to them.  Thank you for your consideration, for your attention to this matter, and for allowing me to speak with you all today. I would be happy to try to answer any questions by the Committee.                    Sincerely,                                Tina Heather Nadeau, Esq.                               MACDL Executive Director
