Case Summary
Overview
HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court did not abuse its discretion in 
determining that testimony proffered by a defense expert was 
inadmissible diminished capacity evidence; [2]-Defendant was 
not entitled to a unanimous verdict as to the means of 
commission of child abuse or first degree murder, and the State 
presented substantial evidence to support all three alternative 
means of child abuse and to support a determination that his 
actions caused the victim's death; [3]-Defendant's rights to due 
process and a fair trial were not violated when, pursuant to Ariz. 
R. Crim. P. 39(b)(8)-(9), the trial court allowed the victim's 
mother to have a facility dog and its handler sit beside the 
mother during the trial, as the dog was not with the mother 
when the mother testified, the dog was only with the mother 
when she sat in the gallery, and was there to prevent undue 
stress to the mother during a difficult trial about the death of 
her infant son.
Outcome
Judgment affirmed.

HN7 [ ]  Verdicts, Unanimity
The right to a unanimous jury verdict is established in the 
Arizona Constitution. Ariz. Const. art. II, § 23. In the context of 
statutes describing offenses that may be committed in multiple 
ways—sometimes referred to as "alternative-means" or "single 
unified offense" statutes—the jury must be unanimous as to 
whether the charged criminal act has been committed. However, 
the defendant is not entitled to a unanimous verdict on the 
precise manner in which the act was committed as long as there 
is substantial evidence to support each of the charged means of 
commission. The jury may reach a verdict based on a 
combination of alternative findings.
Criminal Law & 
Procedure > Trials > Verdicts > Unanimity
HN8 [ ]  Verdicts, UnanimityFirst-degree murder is a single unified offense. It is unified 
because the harm the murder statutes seek to prevent is the 
same—the death itself. Thus, jury unanimity is not required 
about the precise mechanism of death.

HN9 [ ]  Children & Minors, Child Abuse
Child abuse under circumstances likely to produce death or 
serious physical injury pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat.§ 13-3623(A) 
is a single unified offense. Although the crime can be committed 
in three different ways, the statute focuses on a single harm to 
the victim. Thus, a child abuse defendant does not have a right 
to jury unanimity as to the precise manner in which the act was 
committed.

Opinion
 [*1228]  MILLER, Judge:
P1 A jury found Jeremy Millis guilty of one count of intentional 
or knowing child abuse under circumstances likely to result in 
death or serious physical injury and one count of first-degree 
murder, both committed against a victim under age fifteen. 
Millis was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility 
of release for thirty-five years for murder, to be followed by a 
consecutive ten-year prison term for child abuse. On appeal, he 
contends the trial court erroneously precluded expert testimony 
about his autism, he was prejudiced by a duplicitous charge, and 
the court erred by allowing the victim's mother to be 
accompanied at trial by a facility dog.1 We affirm [**2]  for the 
following reasons.
1 Although cases refer to victim/witness support dogs using many 
different terms, see, e.g., People v. Spence, 212 Cal. App. 4th 478, 151 Cal. 
Rptr. 3d 374, 400 n.4 (Ct. App. 2012) ("therapy dog" or "support 
canine"); State v. Jacobs, 2015-Ohio-4353, ¶ 19, 2015 WL 6180908 (Ohio 
Ct. App. 2015) ("companion dog"); State v. Dye, 178 Wn.2d 541, 309 
P.3d 1192, ¶ 1 (Wash. 2013) ("comfort animal" or "facility dog"), we 
use the term "facility dog" in this opinion because that is the term our 
legislature elected to use in a newly enacted statute on the subject, see 
A.R.S. § 13-4442.Factual and Procedural Background
P2 HN1 [ ] "We view the facts and all reasonable inferences 
therefrom in the light most favorable to upholding the jury's 
verdict[s]." State v. Causbie, 241 Ariz. 173, ¶ 2, 384 P.3d 1253, 
1255 (App. 2016). Millis and S.F. began dating in 2012 and after 
a few months they began sharing an apartment. Not long after 
that, the relationship ended and Millis moved out, but they 
remained on good terms with one another. In order to help 
offset the cost of the lease that S.F. now bore on her own, Millis 
agreed to watch S.F.'s two young sons one day a week while she 
was at work.
P3 On the morning of January 24, 2013, S.F. changed the diaper 
of her eight-month-old son, C.K. He had no bruises on him. 
She later took some pictures of C.K. "having a lot of fun . . . 
and being very smiley" in his bouncer. Millis arrived to babysit 
the boys and she left for work at around 2:00 p.m. Millis was the 
only person watching the boys while S.F. was at work.
P4 S.F. arrived home around 11:00 p.m. She looked in on the 
boys and they appeared to be asleep. Millis told S.F. that C.K. 
had been coughing and choking earlier that night, but S.F. was 
not worried because she knew C.K. had a condition called 
tracheomalacia, a "floppiness" [**3]  in the cartilage of the 
trachea that sometimes caused him to make choking sounds, 
cough, or wheeze. Millis left and S.F. went to bed.
P5 C.K. woke up at about 2:30 or 3:00 a.m. and S.F. tried to 
feed him a bottle. He did not eat much, but seemed to go back 
to sleep after about fifteen or twenty minutes. Then at about 
5:30 a.m., C.K. started crying in a way that "didn't sound right. 
It wasn't his normal cry." S.F. picked him up but he would not 
open his eyes or respond to his name, and she had to hold his 
head up.
P6 S.F. rushed C.K. to the hospital, which was across the street 
from her apartment. When they arrived at the emergency room, 
the staff took him right away, but he began  [*1229]  having 
seizures. At 6:53 a.m., S.F. texted Millis and told him something 
was wrong with C.K.—he was crying "weird" and was 
nonresponsive. Millis replied that C.K. had been "a little weird 
when he did that cho[]king thing" the night before. She asked if 
C.K. had hit his head on anything, and Millis replied, "I don't 
think so. Just from him sitting on the carpet and tip[p]ing over . 
. . [b]ut nothing bad." She told Millis C.K. was "seizing" and had 
a "head bleed," to which Millis replied, "Oh my god. Maybe 
that's what he was [**4]  doing last night. I didn't know what he 
was doing. I squeezed his neck a little [because] he was having 
trouble breathing. He cried a little then went back to sleep so I 
thought he was fine." In a subsequent recorded confrontation 
call, Millis told S.F. he had found C.K. "stiff" and making 
"gasping noises" at one point, and had responded by 
391 P.3d 1225, *1225 ; 2017 Ariz. App. LEXIS 35, **1
Page 4 of 8
"squeez[ing] his neck" "firm[ly]."
P7 C.K. had bilateral subdural hematomas, which caused 
bleeding on both sides of his brain, bruising, and swelling. 
Analysis of a CT scan indicated the head trauma had occurred 
within approximately the last twenty-four hours, and could not 
have been the result of C.K. merely falling back onto carpet 
from a seated position. His fontanel was also bulging, and in 
each eye he had "too many [retinal hemorrhages] to count" 
across all layers of the retina. C.K. also had bruises on his head, 
ears, neck, chin, upper arms, shoulders, and "wrap[ping] 
around" his chest and rib cage. Numerous medical professionals 
testified that C.K.'s injuries were not consistent with an 
accidental fall, but were consistent with blunt force head trauma, 
intentional choking, and violent shaking.
P8 C.K. died on January 30, five days after he was admitted to 
the hospital. [**5]  A forensic pathologist opined that the date 
of the injuries was five to six days prior to death. The 
pathologist ruled C.K.'s death a homicide and determined the 
co-equal and interrelated causes of death to be (1) blunt force 
trauma to the head, and (2) hypoxic ischemic injury, which is a 
lack of oxygen and blood to the brain.
P9 S.F. was interviewed by investigating detectives the day C.K. 
was admitted to the hospital. She showed them her text message 
exchange with Millis. They located Millis, advised him of his 
Miranda2 rights, and he agreed to an interview. When they 
confronted him with information about C.K.'s head injuries, 
Millis told the detectives he had accidentally hit C.K.'s head on 
the oven door while he was taking food out of the oven, even 
though he had denied any head injuries when he was texting 
with S.F. while she was at the hospital. He also told the 
detectives that C.K. had been "crying a lot" and that he had 
"choked [C.K.]" with his hand. In a second Mirandized 
interview after C.K. died, Millis again admitted he had been 
"frustrated" with C.K., "just wanted him to stop crying," and 
"chok[ed]" him to get him to quiet down, adding that he "just 
couldn't take it anymore" and [**6]  "I did what I did."3 Millis 
also told his ex-wife in a recorded jail video call that "he [had] 
choked [S.F.'s] baby."
P10 At trial, Millis argued the blunt force trauma alone could 
have caused the brain swelling, which in turn could have choked 
off oxygenated blood to the brain, causing the hypoxic ischemic 
injury notwithstanding any strangulation. However, the forensic 
2 See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 
2d 694 (1966).
3 At another point, Millis told the detective that he had only "squeezed" 
C.K.'s neck because C.K. was having trouble breathing and Millis was 
trying "to see if there was something there, if he could move [the neck] 
around."pathologist testified that the blunt force trauma alone could not 
account for certain injuries noted on an MRI. In closing, Millis 
argued that his choking the baby was not what killed him, that 
S.F. had inflicted the injuries that caused C.K.'s death after he 
had left that night, and that "shaking plus impact explains the 
[whole] universe of injuries that we have." In the alternative, he 
argued he had choked C.K. recklessly or negligently, not 
intentionally.
P11 The jury convicted Millis of all charges and he was 
sentenced as described above. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 
A.R.S. §§ 13-4031 and 13-4033(A)(1).
 [*1230]  Preclusion of Expert Testimony
P12 Millis argues the trial court erred by precluding a defense 
expert from testifying Millis suffers from autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) when it concluded that the proffered testimony 
was diminished capacity [**7]  evidence as opposed to 
character trait evidence. HN2 [ ] We review a ruling to admit 
or preclude expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. State v. 
Wright, 214 Ariz. 540, ¶ 5, 155 P.3d 1064, 1066 (App. 2007). 
Because Millis HN3 [ ] opposed the state's motion to preclude 
the testimony and made an offer of proof, we review for 
harmless error. See Ariz. R. Evid. 103(a); State v. Henderson, 210 
Ariz. 561, ¶ 18, 115 P.3d 601, 607 (2005).
P13 Before trial, defense counsel filed a motion to assess Millis's 
competency pursuant to Rule 11.2(a), Ariz. R. Crim. P. Counsel 
attached to the motion the opinion of Dr. Pablo Stewart, who 
concluded in relevant part that Millis suffers from ASD without 
accompanying intellectual or language impairments. Relying on 
the testimony of two other experts who rejected that diagnosis, 
the trial court found Millis competent to stand trial.
P14 Millis asked to continue the trial in order to accommodate 
Dr. Stewart's schedule so that he could testify about the ASD 
diagnosis. The state moved to preclude any ASD testimony, 
which it characterized as evidence of diminished capacity. 
Defense counsel argued the ASD diagnosis would not be 
offered to show diminished capacity, but to show Millis had a 
character trait of "difficulty in understanding how to interact 
appropriately with others," which could have made it "more or 
less likely that he formed the intent required [**8]  in this 
particular case." After a hearing at which Millis made an offer of 
proof, the trial court granted the state's motion to preclude 
Stewart's testimony, finding it was offered to support a 
diminished capacity defense and was not character evidence. 
The court also denied Millis's motion to continue the trial.
P15 HN4 [ ] Arizona does not recognize a "diminished 
capacity" defense, in which expert psychiatric evidence about a 
defendant's mental incapacity is offered to negate mens rea. State 
391 P.3d 1225, *1229 ; 2017 Ariz. App. LEXIS 35, **4
Page 5 of 8
v. Mott, 187 Ariz. 536, 540-41, 544, 931 P.2d 1046, 1050-51, 
1054 (1997); see State v. Schantz, 98 Ariz. 200, 212-13, 403 P.2d 
521, 529 (1965). Unlike insanity pursuant to A.R.S. § 13-
502(A)—an "affirmative defense that excuses, mitigates, or 
lessens a defendant's moral culpability due to his psychological 
impairment"—the diminished capacity defense aims to rebut an 
element of mens rea. Mott, 187 Ariz. at 540, 931 P.2d at 1050. 
The court in Mott observed that our legislature declined to adopt 
a diminished capacity defense when given the opportunity, id. at 
540-41, 931 P.2d at 1050-51, and instead confined "any 
consideration of characteristic behavior associated with mental 
disease" to its bearing on an insanity defense,4 Clark v. Arizona, 
548 U.S. 735, 762, 126 S. Ct. 2709, 165 L. Ed. 2d 842 (2006); 
Wright, 214 Ariz. 540, ¶ 15, 155 P.3d at 1069.
P16 In Mott, our supreme court affirmed preclusion of evidence 
that "battered-woman syndrome" and low intelligence 
diminished the defendant's capacity to decide to seek medical 
care for her child. 187 Ariz. at 544-45, 931 P.2d at 1054-55. 
Similarly, in [**9]  State v. Buot, 232 Ariz. 432, 306 P.3d 89 (App. 
2013), the defendant sought to introduce evidence that he had 
"behavior consistent with an intermittent explosive disorder and 
that his actions are reflexive and therefore impulsive and not the 
result of a conscious thought process." Id. ¶ 11. We affirmed 
preclusion of the evidence because it was offered to rebut a 
knowing or reckless mens rea for a second-degree murder 
charge. Id. ¶ 20; see also § 13-502(A) ("impulse control disorders" 
cannot underpin insanity defense). And in State v. Lopez, 234 
Ariz. 465, ¶¶ 20-23, 323 P.3d 748, 752 (App. 2014), we affirmed 
the preclusion of evidence of a defendant's purported character 
trait of "acting impulsively under stress without being aware of 
the consequences of his actions," reasoning that the only 
relevance of such evidence was for an impermissible diminished 
capacity defense.
 [*1231]  P17 Millis contends that Dr. Stewart's testimony 
would not have rebutted an intentional or knowing mens rea, 
which he agrees would violate Arizona law, but instead would 
have established a lesser mens rea that would allow the jury to 
convict on reckless or negligent child abuse. Conviction for a 
lesser-included offense would also result in an acquittal on the 
felony murder charge. See A.R.S. § 13-1105(A)(2). The state 
correctly notes the circular nature of this argument. [**10]  
Evidence that a person only acted with a mental state of 
recklessness or negligence necessarily means the person did not 
act knowingly or intentionally. See A.R.S. § 13-105(10). Millis 
acknowledged this purpose when defense counsel explained at 
the motion hearing the evidence would show "that being on the 
autism spectrum made Jeremy Millis less likely to be able to 
4 This limitation comports with due process. Clark v. Arizona, 548 U.S. 
735, 769-71, 126 S. Ct. 2709, 165 L. Ed. 2d 842 (2006).form certain intent." Thus, the trial court did not abuse its 
discretion in determining that Stewart's proffered testimony was 
inadmissible diminished capacity evidence under Mott and its 
progeny.
P18 Millis argues in the alternative that Dr. Stewart should have 
been allowed to present limited "observation evidence" about 
Millis's character traits without mentioning the ASD diagnosis. 
See Clark, 548 U.S. at 757-58 (defining "observation evidence" as 
"testimony from those who observed what [the defendant] did 
and heard what he said," including "testimony that an expert 
witness might give about [the defendant's] tendency to think in a 
certain way and his behavioral characteristics"); see generally Buot, 
232 Ariz. 432, ¶ 13, 306 P.3d at 92; Wright, 214 Ariz. 540, ¶¶ 13-
17, 155 P.3d at 1068-69. But he did not clearly present this 
argument to the trial court, nor did he cite Clark or its 
discussion of observation evidence below. To the contrary, his 
offer of proof [**11]  specifically emphasized that Stewart 
needed to opine that Millis suffers from ASD. Cf. Clark, 548 
U.S. at 757-60 (distinguishing admissible "observation evidence" 
from inadmissible "mental-disease evidence," i.e., "opinion 
testimony that [the defendant] suffered from a mental disease 
with features described by the witness"). HN5 [ ] We do not 
address an argument made for the first time on appeal. See State 
v. Flores, 160 Ariz. 235, 238, 772 P.2d 589, 592 (App. 1989).
P19 Millis's reliance on State v. Christensen, 129 Ariz. 32, 628 P.2d 
580 (1981), is unavailing. In that case our supreme court held 
that expert testimony about the defendant's purported character 
trait of impulsivity was admissible to rebut the premeditation 
element of first-degree premeditated murder. Id. at 34-35, 628 
P.2d at 582-83. But subsequent cases have clarified that 
Christensen is only applicable in the context of premeditated 
murder. See Lopez, 234 Ariz. 465, ¶ 22, 323 P.3d at 752. Here, 
the jury was only instructed on felony murder, not on 
premeditated murder.
Duplicitous Charges
P20 Millis next contends duplicitous charges deprived him of 
his right to a unanimous jury verdict.5 Specifically, he argues 
some jurors could have concluded the child died from blunt 
force head trauma while others could have concluded he died 
from a lack of oxygen to the brain caused by choking. He did 
not object on this basis below; therefore, our review is [**12]  
limited to fundamental error. Henderson, 210 Ariz. 561, ¶¶ 19-20, 
115 P.3d at 607-08. HN6 [ ] A denial of the right to a 
5 Millis does not argue he faced a duplicitous indictment. See generally 
State v. Klokic, 219 Ariz. 241, ¶¶ 10-13, 196 P.3d 844, 846-47 (App. 
2008) (distinguishing between duplicitous indictment and duplicitous 
charge).
391 P.3d 1225, *1230 ; 2017 Ariz. App. LEXIS 35, **8
Page 6 of 8
unanimous jury verdict constitutes fundamental prejudicial 
error. See State v. Delgado, 232 Ariz. 182, ¶ 19, 303 P.3d 76, 82 
(App. 2013).
P21 HN7 [ ] The right to a unanimous jury verdict is 
established in the Arizona Constitution. Ariz. Const. art. II, § 
23. In the context of statutes describing offenses that may be 
committed in multiple ways—sometimes referred to as 
"alternative-means" or "single unified offense" statutes—the 
jury must be unanimous as to whether the charged criminal act 
has been committed. State v. West, 238 Ariz. 482, ¶¶ 13, 19, 362 
P.3d 1049, 1055, 1056 (App. 2015). "However, 'the defendant is 
not entitled to a unanimous verdict on the precise manner in 
which the act was committed'"  [*1232]  as long as there is 
substantial evidence to support each of the charged means of 
commission. Id. ¶¶ 13, 15, quoting State v. Herrera, 176 Ariz. 9, 16, 
859 P.2d 119, 126 (1993). The jury may reach a verdict "based 
on a combination of alternative findings." Id. ¶ 13, quoting State v. 
Dann, 220 Ariz. 351, ¶ 79, 207 P.3d 604, 620 (2009).
P22 HN8 [ ] First-degree murder is a single unified offense. 
See, e.g., State v. Tucker, 205 Ariz. 157, ¶¶ 50-51, 68 P.3d 110, 120 
(2003), citing Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624, 643-45, 111 S. Ct. 
2491, 115 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1991); see also State v. Gomez, 211 Ariz. 
494, n.3, 123 P.3d 1131, 1135 n.3 (2005) (affirming conviction 
where six jurors found first-degree felony murder and six found 
first-degree premeditated murder). It is unified because the 
harm the murder statutes seek to prevent is the same—the 
death itself. See State v. O'Laughlin, 239 Ariz. 398, ¶¶ 7-9, 372 
P.3d 342, 345-46 (App. 2016) (distinction between statutes 
describing single unified offense rather [**13]  than multiple 
offenses "often relies on the harm resulting from the crime"). 
Thus, jury unanimity is not required about the precise 
mechanism of death. See Schad, 501 U.S. at 631-32, citing Andersen 
v. United States, 170 U.S. 481, 500, 18 S. Ct. 689, 42 L. Ed. 1116 
(1898) (immaterial whether murder victim died by shooting or 
drowning; government need not charge these alternatively); see 
also State v. Payne, 233 Ariz. 484, ¶ 81, 314 P.3d 1239, 1263 
(2013) ("jury need not be unanimous as to the theory of first 
degree murder as long as all agree that the murder was 
committed"), quoting Gomez, 211 Ariz. 494, n.3, 123 P.3d at 1135 
n.3.
P23 Similarly, HN9 [ ] child abuse under circumstances likely 
to produce death or serious physical injury pursuant to A.R.S. § 
13-3623(A) is also a single unified offense. West, 238 Ariz. 482, 
¶¶ 19-22, 362 P.3d at 1056-57. Although the crime can be 
committed in three different ways, the statute "focuses on a 
single harm to the victim." Id. ¶ 21, quoting State v. Paredes-Solano, 
223 Ariz. 284, ¶ 14, 222 P.3d 900, 906 (App. 2009); see Payne, 
233 Ariz. 484, ¶¶ 80, 88, 90, 314 P.3d at 1262, 1263-64 (whether 
committed by failing to feed or failing to provide medical care, 
child abuse is "only one crime"). Thus, a child abuse defendant does not have a right to jury unanimity as to "the precise 
manner in which the act was committed." West, 238 Ariz. 482, ¶ 
30, 362 P.3d at 1059, quoting Herrera, 176 Ariz. at 16, 859 P.2d at 
126.
P24 Here, the trial court instructed the jury that in order to 
convict Millis of first-degree felony murder, the state was 
required to prove (1) the victim's death occurred in the course 
of and in furtherance of the predicate felony (intentional [**14]  
or knowing child abuse under circumstances likely to produce 
death or serious physical injury), (2) "the death was proximately 
caused by the acts of the defendant,"6 and (3) "but for the 
defendant's conduct, the death would not have occurred." Millis 
is correct that some jurors may have concluded he intentionally 
or knowingly choked the child causing his death, while others 
may have concluded he intentionally or knowingly inflicted head 
trauma to cause death. But he was not entitled to a unanimous 
verdict as to the means of commission of child abuse, nor of 
first degree murder. Id. ¶ 46; see also Payne, 233 Ariz. 484, ¶¶ 88, 
90, 314 P.3d at 1263-64. Furthermore, the state presented 
substantial evidence to support all three alternative means of 
child abuse. See West, 238 Ariz. 482, ¶ 30, 362 P.3d at 1059, citing 
State v. Forrester, 134 Ariz. 444, 447, 657 P.2d 432, 435 (1982). 
No duplicity error occurred.
P25 Millis argues even if child abuse under § 13-3623(A)(1) is a 
single unified offense, he suffered a duplicitous charge pursuant 
State v. Klokic, 219 Ariz. 241, 196 P.3d 844 (App. 2008), because 
the state introduced evidence of multiple acts to support the 
child abuse charge that were not part of the same criminal 
transaction. In West, a recent case also dealing with fatal child 
abuse pursuant to § 13-3623(A), we considered and rejected this 
argument. 238 Ariz. 482, ¶¶ 31-39, 362 P.3d at 1059-61. We 
held the multiple-acts analysis in Klokic is generally 
inapplicable [**15]  to cases involving a single unified offense 
such as child abuse under § 13-3623(A). See West,  [*1233]  238 
Ariz. 482, ¶¶ 38-39, 362 P.3d at 1061. Here, as in West, the state 
had little choice but to allege the multiple acts because "it did 
not know the precise timing and nature of the injury leading to 
[C.K.'s] death." Id. ¶ 45. Moreover, as in West, even if the state 
alleged multiple acts to support the child abuse charge, these 
acts "'only caused a single result'—[C.K.'s] death—and were 
part of a 'single criminal undertaking'" occurring over the course 
of a single afternoon and evening. Id., quoting Klokic, 219 Ariz. 
241, ¶ 28, 196 P.3d at 850; see also Payne, 233 Ariz. 484, ¶¶ 88, 90, 
314 P.3d at 1263-64 (child abuse "only one crime"; jury 
unanimity not required as to whether offense committed by 
failing to feed or failing to seek medical attention).
P26 Finally, even if a duplicity error had occurred, Millis has not 
met his burden of showing prejudice. Henderson, 210 Ariz. 561, ¶ 
6 The instruction went on to define proximate causation.
391 P.3d 1225, *1231 ; 2017 Ariz. App. LEXIS 35, **12
Page 7 of 8
20, 115 P.3d at 607. First, as to the child abuse charge, 
regardless of whether the choking actually caused death, no 
reasonable juror could have failed to find that Millis knowingly 
or intentionally choked C.K.7 Cf. Payne, 233 Ariz. 484, ¶ 90, 314 
P.3d at 1264 (no reasonable jury could have failed to find 
defendant guilty of child abuse for failing to seek medical care). 
Millis repeatedly admitted choking C.K. so that he would stop 
crying, and the jury [**16]  reasonably could have concluded 
that the bruises wrapping around C.K.'s neck were inflicted 
while Millis alone was watching him. And second, as to the first-
degree murder charge, even if some jurors believed the choking 
Millis admitted was a but-for cause of death, while others 
believed the choking was not a cause of death but believed 
Millis knowingly or intentionally inflicted the blunt force trauma 
and that it caused C.K.'s death, Millis had no right to jury 
unanimity as to the means of commission of murder. See Schad, 
501 U.S. at 631-32.
Victim's Use of Facility Dog at Trial
P27 Millis argues the trial court denied him due process and a 
fair trial by allowing a facility dog and its handler to sit beside 
S.F. during the trial. HN10 [ ] In keeping with the trial court's 
"broad discretion" in managing trial conduct, State v. Cornell, 179 
Ariz. 314, 332, 878 P.2d 1352, 1370 (1994), this court will not 
disturb a trial court's ruling regarding the use of a facility dog 
absent an abuse of discretion, see State v. Dye, 178 Wn.2d 541, 
309 P.3d 1192, ¶¶ 14-15, 19, 32 (Wash. 2013) (en banc) (ruling 
allowing facility dog to accompany witness reviewed for abuse 
of discretion).
P28 Following S.F.'s appearance at various pretrial hearings 
accompanied by a facility dog named "Blake," Millis brought a 
motion in limine to preclude Blake's presence at trial. He 
argued [**17]  Arizona crime-victim law gives a victim a right to 
be accompanied by a support person, not a support animal, and 
that the dog would unfairly prejudice him by inviting the jury to 
base its decision on emotion or sympathy. The state argued 
Blake would not prejudice Millis, and would help S.F. testify in 
the midst of difficult circumstances. After a hearing, the trial 
court found that the dog's presence would not unfairly prejudice 
Millis. Although the judge expressed a personal preference that 
Blake not be present, she saw no "legal basis" to exclude the 
dog and denied the motion. Millis moved for reconsideration, 
and the court denied that motion as well.8 Blake did not 
7 The knowing or intentional mens rea for child abuse under § 13-
3623(A)(1) applies only to the defendant's actions, not to the "under 
circumstances likely to produce death or serious physical injury" prong. 
See Payne, 233 Ariz. 484, ¶¶ 69-71, 314 P.3d at 1260-61.
8 In his motion for reconsideration, Millis argued in the alternative that accompany S.F. while she testified, but only while she sat in the 
gallery.
P29 The state argues we should review the due process aspect 
of Millis's claim for fundamental error, citing Henderson, 210 
Ariz. 561, ¶¶ 19-20, 115 P.3d at 607-08. But  [*1234]  Millis 
objected to Blake's presence at trial in his motion in limine, and 
argued repeatedly that the dog would unfairly prejudice the jury 
against him. His motion and argument were sufficient to present 
the issue of trial fairness to the trial court, even if he never 
invoked the words "due process" or "fair trial." See State v. 
Foshay, 239 Ariz. 271, ¶¶ 27-28, 370 P.3d 618, 624 (App. 2016). 
Accordingly, [**18]  we review for harmless error. See Henderson, 
210 Ariz. 561, ¶ 18, 115 P.3d at 607 ( HN11 [ ] harmless error 
review places burden on state to prove beyond reasonable doubt 
error did not contribute to or affect verdict or sentence).
P30 As Millis observed in his motion in limine, HN12 [ ] Rule 
39(b), Ariz. R. Crim. P., gives a crime victim9 the right to be 
accompanied at interviews, depositions, and court proceedings 
by a parent, relative, or other "appropriate support person," Ariz. 
R. Crim. P. 39(b)(8)-(9) (emphasis added), but is silent about 
whether the victim may be accompanied by a support animal. At 
the time of Millis's trial, no Arizona statute discussed the use of 
a facility dog in the courtroom. Nor is there any Arizona case 
law on the subject.
P31 Several other states, however, have considered the question 
and at least five have approved the use of dogs to accompany 
witnesses under appropriate circumstances. See People v. Chenault, 
227 Cal. App. 4th 1503, 175 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 9-12 (Ct. App. 
2014); People v. Spence, 212 Cal. App. 4th 478, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
374, 404-06 (Ct. App. 2012); State v. Devon D., 321 Conn. 656, 
138 A.3d 849, 864-67 (Conn. 2016); People v. Tohom, 109 A.D.3d 
253, 969 N.Y.S.2d 123, 131-37 (App. Div. 2013); State v. Jacobs, 
2015-Ohio-4353, ¶¶ 19-28, 2015 WL 6180908 (Ohio Ct. App. 
2015); Dye, 309 P.3d 1192, ¶¶ 17-32.10
he too should be allowed to have a dog with him during trial as a 
matter of equal protection. The state did not oppose Millis's request, 
but when the trial court asked Millis if having a dog with him at trial 
would actually comfort him, he said he did not think so and he did not 
need one. The court then denied Millis's request. He does not challenge 
this ruling on appeal, nor does he raise an equal protection argument.
9 It is undisputed that S.F., as C.K.'s mother, is a "victim" under 
Arizona law. Ariz. Const. art. II, § 2.1(C); A.R.S. § 13-4401(19); Ariz. R. 
Crim. P. 39(a)(1).
10 Dye involved a developmentally disabled adult victim with an IQ of 
65 and a mental age ranging from six to twelve years old who was "very 
scared" to testify about burglaries of his home. 309 P.3d 1192, ¶¶ 2-6, 
9-10, 26. All of the other cases cited involved minor victims testifying 
about sexual abuse.

P32 Millis first asserts that a dog accompanying a victim is 
"presumptively prejudicial" so as to jeopardize a fair trial in 
every case, and contends it "present[s] a nonevidentiary 
message" to the jury that the witness is an innocent victim. 
Other courts have rejected these arguments, as do we. See 
Chenault, 175 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 10 (support dog not inherently 
prejudicial, just as support person not inherently 
prejudicial); [**19]  Tohom, 969 N.Y.S.2d at 134 (no prejudice 
from "the concededly unobtrusive presence of the dog in the 
courtroom"). Since the time of Millis's trial, our own legislature 
has endorsed the use of facility dogs in certain circumstances. 
Section 13-4442, A.R.S., which came into effect after Millis filed 
his opening brief in this appeal, governs the use of such dogs 
for crime victims testifying in court. Among other things, it 
gives the court discretion to allow an adult crime victim to be 
accompanied by a dog.11 § 13-4442(B). Although § 13-4442 was 
not in effect at the time of Millis's trial, it shows the policy of 
the State of Arizona to accommodate crime victims' use of a 
dog. See Taylor v. Graham Cty. Chamber of Commerce, 201 Ariz. 184, 
¶ 27, 33 P.3d 518, 525 (App. 2001) ( HN13 [ ] "[W]hen . . . the 
legislature has clearly spoken on a matter within its domain, its 
word constitutes public policy on that subject and controls, 
assuming no constitutional impediments exist."). Moreover, 
there is no indication that this policy contaminates a fair trial in 
every case. Cf. Dye, 309 P.3d 1192, ¶¶ 29-30 (no indication in 
record that facility dog actually engaged in any prejudicial 
behavior; court would not "speculate about what might have 
happened at trial").
P33 Millis further argues the trial court failed to inquire into and 
weigh the appropriate factors to determine whether a facility 
dog was appropriate [**20]  in this particular case and for this 
particular victim, in an abdication of its role in exercising 
discretion. See State v. Garza, 192 Ariz. 171, ¶ 16, 962 P.2d 898, 
902 (1998) (failure to exercise discretion  [*1235]  may 
constitute abuse of discretion). He notes that other jurisdictions 
typically allow facility dogs for children or developmentally 
disabled adult witnesses whose testimony might otherwise be 
unavailable, and argues the state made no particularized showing 
of why S.F.—an adult with no apparent disability—needed one. 
However, the record indicates that the court considered factors 
relevant to its discretionary balancing of potential benefits and 
potential prejudices from a dog. For instance, the court was 
informed that Blake would not accompany S.F. at the witness 
stand, but would only sit with her in the gallery. This supports 
the court's finding that the use of the dog would not unfairly 
prejudice Millis, because the animal would have been less visible 
and prominent to the jury in the gallery than it would have at 
11 The statute also requires a jury instruction in cases involving a facility 
dog, in order "[t]o ensure that the presence of [the] facility dog . . . does 
not influence the jury or is not a reflection on the truthfulness of any 
testimony" the witness offers. § 13-4442(C).the witness stand. Cf. Devon D., 138 A.3d at 863 (trial court 
approved presence of dog at witness stand but ordered that dog 
be placed such that jury would not see it). The trial court also 
implicitly found that Blake would help prevent undue 
stress [**21]  for S.F. during a difficult trial about the death of 
her infant son.12 See Ariz. R. Evid. 611(a)(3). The court did not 
abandon its duty to exercise discretion, nor did it abuse its 
discretion.
Disposition
P34 We affirm Millis's convictions and sentences for the reasons 
stated above.
End of Document
12 The factors the trial court considered in exercising its discretion in 
this case are not the only factors a court may properly consider in 
determining whether to allow witness accommodations, nor are they 
necessary considerations in every case.
