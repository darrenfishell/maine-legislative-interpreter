Case Summary
Overview
HOLDINGS: [1]-The three cases were properly joined for trial 
under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. § 41-19, because 
the evidence in each case would have been admitted as a prior 
misconduct in the other cases given that the incidents were 
proximate in time, involved prepubescent children of a similar 
age who were defendant's biological children, and involved 
similar conduct so as to demonstrate a propensity toward 
aberrant sexual behavior; [2]-The trial court properly exercised 
its discretion in permitting a dog to sit near the daughter during 
her testimony after hearing testimony that the daughter was

HN1 [ ]  Standards of Review, Abuse of Discretion
When charges are brought in separate informations, and the 
state seeks to join those informations for trial, the state bears 
the burden of proving that the defendant will not be 
substantially prejudiced by joinder pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. 
Book, R. Super. Ct. § 41-19. The state may satisfy this burden by 
proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, either that the 
evidence in the cases is cross admissible or that the defendant 
will not be unfairly prejudiced pursuant to the factors set forth 
in State v. Boscarino. Although the state bears the burden of 
proof in the trial court, it is the defendant's burden on appeal to 
show that joinder was improper by proving substantial prejudice 
that could not be cured by the trial court's instructions to the 
jury. In deciding whether to join informations for trial, the trial 
court enjoys broad discretion, which, in the absence of manifest 
abuse, an appellate court may not disturb.

HN2 [ ]  Jury Instructions, Cautionary Instructions
Evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct properly may be 
admitted in sex crime cases to establish that the defendant had a 
tendency or a propensity to engage in aberrant and compulsive 
criminal sexual behavior if: (1) the trial court finds that such 
evidence is relevant to the charged crime in that it is not too 
remote in time, is similar to the offense charged and is 
committed upon persons similar to the prosecuting witness; and 
(2) the trial court concludes that the probative value of such 
evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. In assessing the 
relevancy of such evidence, and in balancing its probative value 
against its prejudicial effect, the trial court should be guided by 
this court's prior precedent construing the scope and contours 
of the liberal standard pursuant to which evidence of uncharged 
misconduct previously was admitted under the common scheme 
or plan exception. Lastly, prior to admitting evidence of 
uncharged sexual misconduct under the propensity exception, 
the trial court must provide the jury with an appropriate 
cautionary instruction.

HN3 [ ]  Standards of Review, Abuse of Discretion
A trial court's decision will be reversed only when abuse of its 
discretion is manifest or when an injustice appears to have been 
done. On review by the Supreme Court of Connecticut, 
therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in 
favor of the trial court's ruling.

The similarity of uncharged conduct need not be so unusual and 
distinctive as to be like a signature. Rather, the question is 
whether the evidence is sufficiently similar to demonstrate a 
propensity to engage in the type of aberrant and compulsive 
criminal sexual behavior with which he was charged.

The process of balancing probative value and prejudicial effect 
is critical to the determination of whether other crimes evidence 
is admissible. At the same time, however, reviewing court do 
not require a trial court to use some talismanic phraseology in 
order to satisfy this balancing process. Rather, in order for this 
test to be satisfied, a reviewing court must be able to infer from 
the entire record that the trial court considered the prejudicial 
effect of the evidence against its probative nature before making 
a ruling. In conducting this balancing test, the question before 
the trial court is not whether the evidence is damaging to the 
defendant but whether the evidence will improperly arouse the 
emotions of the jurors.

The function of the court in a criminal trial is to conduct a fair 
and impartial proceeding. trial judge in a criminal case may take 
all steps reasonably necessary for the orderly progress of the 
trial. When the rights of those other than the parties are 
implicated, the trial judge has the responsibility for safeguarding 
both the rights of the accused and the interests of the public in 
the administration of criminal justice. Moreover, the ability of a 
witness to testify reliably is a matter peculiarly within the 
discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only 
in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law.

Although the Supreme Court of Connecticut applies an abuse of 
discretion standard to review the trial court's decision to permit 
a dog to sit near a witness during her testimony, it engages in 
plenary review with respect to the standard and procedures that the trial court used in making this determination. The 
appropriate standard is whether the trial court has balanced the 
extent that the special accommodation will aid the reliability of 
the witness' testimony against any possible prejudice to the 
defendant's right to a fair trial.

HN11 [ ]  Trials, Judicial Discretion
Trial courts are in the best position to determine how to control 
trial proceedings, especially the mode of interrogating witnesses. 
In light of the trial courts' position and their discretion, it is not 
erroneous for them to approve a variety of special allowances 
for child victims of sexual abuse. These special allowances may 
include using a dog during the child victim's testimony under 
certain circumstances.
Criminal Law & 
Procedure > Trials > Witnesses > Presentation
HN12 [ ]  Witnesses, Presentation
A trial court may exercise its discretion to permit a dog to 
provide comfort and support to a testifying witness. Before 
doing so, the court must balance the extent to which the 
accommodation will help the witness to testify reliably and 
completely against any possible prejudice to the defendant's 
right to a fair trial. The trial court should consider the particular 
facts and circumstances for the request to have a dog 
accompany the particular witness, the extent to which the dog's 
presence will permit the witness to testify truthfully, completely 
and reliably, and the extent to which the dog's presence will 
obviate the need for more drastic measures to secure the 
witness' testimony. The trial court should balance these factors 
against the potential prejudice to the defendant and the 
availability of measures to mitigate any prejudice, such as 
limiting instructions and procedures to limit the jury's view of 
the dog.
Syllabus
Convicted, in three cases that were joined for trial, of multiple 
counts of sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a 
child in connection with the defendant's sexual abuse of three of 
his biological children, A, B and C, the defendant [***2]  
321 Conn. 656, *656 ; 138 A.3d 849, **849 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***1
Page 4 of 14
appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court's 
judgments. Each of the three cases involved charges specific to 
each child. The Appellate Court concluded, inter alia, that the 
trial court had abused its discretion in denying the defendant's 
motion to sever the three cases and in allowing a dog to sit near 
A during her trial testimony to provide comfort and support. 
On the granting of certification, the state appealed to this court. 
Held:
1. The Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court 
had abused its discretion in permitting the three cases against 
the defendant to be tried jointly, as the defendant could not 
demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced by the denial of 
his motion for severance because the evidence in all three cases 
would have been cross admissible to show that the defendant 
had a tendency or a propensity to engage in aberrant and 
compulsive sexual misconduct; the incidents involving A, B and 
C were proximate in time, the three victims were similarly 
situated in that they were all prepubescent children of similar 
age who were the defendant's biological children, the 
defendant's conduct with respect to each child was 
sufficiently [***3]  similar to demonstrate that he had a 
propensity toward aberrant sexual behavior, and the fact that 
the defendant engaged in additional types of misconduct with A 
did not render that misconduct so much more severe and 
shocking than his misconduct with B and C that severance was 
required.
2. The Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court 
had abused its discretion in permitting a dog to sit near A during 
her trial testimony for comfort and support; the trial court had 
inherent discretionary authority, apart from that conferred by 
the statute (§ 54-86g) enumerating the procedures that a court 
may employ when a child testifies in a sexual assault case, to 
order special procedures or accommodations to assist A in 
testifying, and, because the record demonstrated that the trial 
court expressly found that the dog would help A to testify more 
reliably and completely and that the dog's presence would not 
violate the defendant's right to a fair trial, and also demonstrated 
that the trial court took extensive measures to ensure that the 
jurors never saw the dog, which was out of their view, the trial 
court properly exercised its discretion in allowing the dog to sit 
near A while she testified. [***4]

Opinion
 [**852]   [*658]  ZARELLA, J. After a jury trial, the 
defendant, Devon D., was convicted of four counts of sexual 
assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes § 53a-
70 (a) (2), three counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of 
General Statutes § 53-21 (a) (1), and four counts of risk of injury 
to a child in violation of § 53-21 (a) (2). The charges were 
brought in three separate informations and involved allegations 
made by three of the defendant's biological children-C1, C2 and 
C3.1 From the judgments of conviction, the defendant appealed 
to the Appellate Court, which concluded that the trial court had 
abused its discretion in two ways-by permitting the three cases 
against the defendant to  [*659]  be tried jointly and by 
permitting C1 to testify with a dog at her feet for comfort and 
support. In the present appeal, the state contends that the 
Appellate [***5]  Court incorrectly concluded that the trial 
court had abused its discretion in denying the defendant's 
motion to sever the three cases and in allowing a dog to be 
present with C1 during her testimony. We agree with the state.
The jury reasonably could have found the following relevant 
facts and procedural history. The defendant and his former 
girlfriend, GF, have several children together, including a girl, 
C1, and two boys, C2 and C3. After the defendant and GF 
separated in 2005, the children visited the defendant at his 
residence or at his mother's home. In October, 2009, seven year 
old C1 told GF that the defendant had put his "wee-wee" on 
her stomach and had touched her "private part" with his fingers. 
Erin Byrne, a clinical child interview specialist for the Children's 
Advocacy Center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, 
interviewed C1 in November, 2009, and in March, 2010. In the 
first interview, C1 "spoke about being in a bedroom [in her 
grandmother's house] with her father and that he had 
poured [***6]  some lotion on her body, as well as poured the 
white stuff from his wee-wee on her body, and had contact with 
her genitals with his fingers." C1 also disclosed that the 
defendant had inserted his finger into her vagina while bathing 
her and using a rag, causing her to bleed. He also forced C1 and 
her siblings to watch a pornographic movie.
In the second interview, C1 told Byrne that the defendant had 
1 To be consistent with the Appellate Court's decision in the present 
case, we refer to the victims as C1, C2 and C3, and refer to the 
defendant's former girlfriend as GF. See State v. Devon D., 150 Conn. 
App. 514, 516, 90 A.3d 383 (2014).321 Conn. 656, *656 ; 138 A.3d 849, **849 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***2

penetrated her "private part" with his penis, had attempted to 
penetrate her "butt" with his penis and had ejaculated on her 
several times. She also told Byrne that the defendant had forced 
her to perform fellatio on him, causing her to vomit. 
Additionally, C1 told Byrne that the defendant had told her that 
she might die from eating meat and that the reason he "does 
 [*660]  the nasty stuff" is to get the "meat" she had eaten "out" 
of her body. C1 told Byrne that the defendant had put vinegar, 
or a substance that stung, on her vagina and in her ear, and that 
he had tried to put his penis in her ear, causing it to bleed. C1 
stated that these incidents occurred in her grandmother's 
 [**853]  home on different days, and that the defendant had 
his clothes off or his pants pulled down each time. The 
defendant [***7]  warned C1 not to say anything about these 
incidents.
Nine year old C2 also came forward with allegations against the 
defendant in November, 2009. In an interview with Stacy 
Karpowitz, a child forensic interview specialist with the 
Children's Advocacy Center, C2 stated that, on several 
occasions, the defendant had inserted a rag covered finger into 
his "butt hole" while C2 was bathing. C2 also stated that the 
defendant had rubbed C2's penis and made it go "up and 
down." In doing so, the defendant sometimes used a rag and 
sometimes used his hand. Finally, C2 stated that the defendant 
had made him watch a pornographic movie with his siblings and 
had warned him not to say anything.
Also, in November, 2009, Lisa Murphy-Cipolla, a clinical child 
interview supervisor with the Children's Advocacy Center, 
interviewed ten year old C3. C3 stated that the defendant had 
inserted his finger into C3's "butt" on more than one occasion, 
and that he had been using a rag, but the rag "slipped." The 
defendant also had squeezed C3's penis and had pulled back the 
foreskin on C3's penis on multiple occasions. C3 further stated 
that the defendant sometimes made him shower with C2, but he 
did not see the defendant [***8]  do anything to C2. C3, 
however, had seen the defendant insert his finger into C1's 
"butt" on at least one occasion. Finally, C3 told Murphy-Cipolla 
that the defendant had made him watch a pornographic movie 
with his siblings and had warned him not to tell GF that the 
defendant was bathing him.
 [*661]  On the basis of these allegations, the defendant was 
arrested and charged with four counts of sexual assault in the 
first degree in violation of § 53a-70 (a) (2), three counts of risk 
of injury to a child in violation of § 53-21 (a) (1), and four 
counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of § 53-21 (a) (2). 
During a trial before a jury, the video-recorded interviews with 
C1, C2 and C3 were admitted into evidence as full exhibits, and 
all three recordings were played for the jury.
In its final charge to the jury, the trial court instructed: "In a 
criminal case in which the defendant is charged with a crime exhibiting abhorrent and compulsive sexual criminal behavior, 
evidence of the defendant's commission of another offense or 
offenses is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on 
any matter to which it is relevant. So for these three cases, you 
may use [C2's] and [C3's] testimony in this fashion in [C1's] case. 
In [C2's] case, [***9]  you may use [C1's] and [C3's] testimony 
for this specific purpose. In [C3's] case, [C1's] and [C2's] 
testimony.
"However, evidence of another offense on its own is not 
sufficient to prove the defendant guilty of the crime or crimes 
charged in the informations. Bear in mind as you consider this 
evidence that, at all times, the state has the burden of proving 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed each 
of the elements of the offense or offenses charged in each 
information. I remind you that the defendant is not on trial for 
any act, conduct, or offense not charged in the informations. 
With regard to propensity evidence, like other evidence, you 
decide to give it the weight you find reasonable." Defense 
counsel did not object or take exception to the trial court's 
instructions to the jury.
After the jury returned verdicts of guilty as to all counts, the trial 
court rendered judgments in accordance with the verdicts. The 
defendant then appealed  [*662]  to the Appellate Court, which 
reversed the judgments of conviction and remanded the cases 
for new trials. State v. Devon D., 150 Conn. App. 514, 550, 90 
A.3d 383  [**854]  (2014). We granted the state's petition for 
certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate 
Court.2 Additional facts will [***10]  be set forth as necessary.
I
The first question in this certified appeal is whether the 
Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court had 
abused its discretion in denying the defendant's motion to sever 
the three cases against him. The state contends that the cases 
properly were joined for trial because the evidence in each case 
would have been admitted as prior misconduct in the other 
cases. We agree with the state.
The following procedural history and facts are relevant to our 
resolution of this claim. On March 29, 2011, the defendant filed 
a motion to sever the cases against him. During argument 
before the trial court, defense counsel claimed that the main 
2 We granted the state's petition for certification to appeal, limited to 
the following two questions: First, "[d]id the Appellate Court properly 
conclude that the trial court erred by joinder of the three sexual assault 
cases against the defendant?" State v. Devon D., 314 Conn. 909, 100 A.3d 
402 (2014). Second, "[d]id the Appellate Court properly determine that 
the trial court's decision to allow an eight year old victim to testify 
accompanied by a comfort canine constituted an abuse of discretion?" 
Id.321 Conn. 656, *659 ; 138 A.3d 849, **852 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***6
Page 6 of 14
concern was that the jury would aggregate the evidence against 
the defendant, [***11]  so that, even if the evidence on any 
single charge would not persuade the jury of his guilt, "the sum 
total of all the charges . . . may persuade the jury that he's guilty 
of all of them." Counsel further argued that, because the case 
concerning C1 was more brutal and shocking than the cases 
concerning C2 and C3, the jurors might find the evidence in the 
first case so offensive that they would not be able to deliberate 
objectively with respect to the remaining two cases. Finally, 
defense counsel  [*663]  argued that the cases should be tried 
separately because they were complex, involving multiple 
charges, children, witnesses, interviewers and police officers, 
and because curative instructions would not be sufficient to 
overcome the potential prejudice of trying the cases jointly.
The state responded that the trial would not be lengthy or 
overly complex because it involved easily separable fact patterns. 
The state emphasized that many of the witnesses would be 
called in all three cases and that, under State v. DeJesus, 288 
Conn. 418, 470-74, 953 A.2d 45 (2008), it expected that 
evidence in the three cases would be cross admissible. Finally, 
the state noted that each case was "shocking on its own, so one 
of them is not more shocking than the other." [***12]  Defense 
counsel refuted the state's contention that the evidence in each 
case would be admissible as prior misconduct in the other cases, 
pointing to the fact that the victims were different ages, that two 
victims were male and one was female, and that the allegations 
involved different types of penetration.
After hearing arguments from counsel, the trial court 
acknowledged that the allegations in all three cases were brutal 
and shocking and recognized the potential effect on the jurors. 
The trial court also noted the difficulties involved in satisfying 
the Boscarino test, which requires a showing that the cases are 
discrete and easily distinguishable, versus the DeJesus test, which 
requires a showing that the cases are similar. After considering 
these and other factors, including the effect of the trial on the 
child victims, the applicable case law, the court's ability to 
permit jurors to take notes and to provide cautionary 
instructions, and judicial economy, the court denied the motion 
for severance.  [**855]  The court noted in particular that the 
cases involved "discrete and easily distinguishable factual 
features," that the trial would not be lengthy or complex, and 
that, because the allegations [***13]   [*664]  in all three cases 
were equally brutal and shocking, "[t]he jurors are going to be 
shocked to some extent in all three of these [cases]."3
3 Although the trial court did not rule specifically on whether the 
evidence would have been cross admissible, it instructed the jury that 
the evidence in each case was admissible in the other cases to prove the 
defendant's propensity to commit crimes of an abhorrent and 
compulsive sexual nature. We conclude that the Appellate Court 
properly reviewed the issue of whether the evidence was cross The standards for reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion 
pertaining to joinder are discussed at length in our decisions in 
State v. LaFleur, 307 Conn. 115, 159, 51 A.3d 1048 (2012), and 
State v. Payne, 303 Conn. 538, 544-50, 34 A.3d 370 (2012). In 
those cases, we rejected the notion of a blanket presumption in 
favor of joinder4 and clarified that, [***14]  HN1 [ ] when 
charges are brought in separate informations, and the state seeks 
to join those informations for trial, "the state bears the burden 
of proving that the defendant will not be substantially 
prejudiced by joinder pursuant to Practice Book § 41-19. The 
state may satisfy this burden by proving, by a preponderance of 
the evidence, either that the evidence in the cases is cross 
admissible or that the defendant will not be unfairly prejudiced 
pursuant to the factors set forth in State v. Boscarino, 204 Conn. 
714, 722-24, 529 A.2d  [*665]  1260 (1987).5 State v. Payne, 
supra, [549-50]." (Footnote added; internal quotation marks 
omitted.) State v. LaFleur, supra, 157. Although the state bears 
the burden of proof in the trial court, "[i]t is the defendant's 
burden on appeal to show that joinder was improper by proving 
substantial prejudice that could not be cured by the trial court's 
instructions to the jury . . . ." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) 
Id., 158. As we emphasized in LaFleur, "our appellate standard 
admissible to show propensity because "both parties address[ed] this 
claim in light of the propensity standard for the admission of 
misconduct evidence in cases concerning crimes of a sexual nature that 
was adopted in State v. DeJesus, supra, 288 Conn. 470-74"; State v. Devon 
D., supra, 150 Conn. App. 522 n.5; and because the test for admitting 
misconduct evidence to show a common scheme or plan also applies to 
admitting misconduct evidence to show a propensity to commit crimes 
of an abhorrent and compulsive sexual nature. See State v. DeJesus, 
supra, 476-77.
4 When the trial in the present case took place, there was a presumption 
in favor of [***15]  joinder. Although the presumption no longer 
applies; see State v. Payne, supra, 303 Conn. 548, 549; the trial court's 
reliance on the presumption is not dispositive because the question 
before us on appeal remains the same. That question is whether the 
defendant has satisfied his burden of "showing that the denial of 
severance resulted in substantial injustice, and that any resulting 
prejudice was beyond the curative power of the court's instructions." 
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. LaFleur, supra, 307 Conn. 
159.
5 In Boscarino, we identified the factors that a trial court should consider 
in determining whether separate trials might be necessary to "avoid 
undue prejudice resulting from consolidation of multiple charges for 
trial. These factors include: (1) whether the charges involve discrete, 
easily distinguishable factual scenarios; (2) whether the crimes were of a 
violent nature or concerned brutal or shocking conduct on the 
defendant's part; and (3) the duration and complexity of the trial. . . . If 
any or all of these factors are present, a reviewing court must decide 
whether the trial court's jury instructions cured any prejudice that might 
have occurred." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. LaFleur, 
supra, 307 Conn. 156.

broad discretion, which, in the absence of manifest abuse, an 
appellate court may not disturb." (Internal quotation marks 
omitted.) Id.
We start our analysis by determining whether the 
evidence [***16]  in the cases concerning C1, C2 and C3 was 
cross admissible, such that evidence in each case would have 
been admissible as prior misconduct in the other cases. In 
DeJesus, we set forth the following standards for determining 
when evidence of prior sexual misconduct is admissible: HN2 [
] "[E]vidence of uncharged sexual misconduct properly may 
be admitted in sex crime cases to establish that the defendant 
had a tendency or a propensity to engage in aberrant and 
compulsive criminal sexual behavior if: (1) the trial court finds 
that such evidence is relevant to the charged crime in that it is 
not too remote in time, is similar to the offense charged and is 
committed upon persons similar to the  [*666]  prosecuting 
witness; and (2) the trial court concludes that the probative 
value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. In 
assessing the relevancy of such evidence, and in balancing its 
probative value against its prejudicial effect, the trial court 
should be guided by this court's prior precedent construing the 
scope and contours of the liberal standard pursuant to which 
evidence of uncharged misconduct previously was admitted 
under the common scheme or plan exception. Lastly, prior to 
admitting evidence [***17]  of uncharged sexual misconduct 
under the propensity exception . . . the trial court must provide 
the jury with an appropriate cautionary instruction . . . ." State v. 
DeJesus, supra, 288 Conn. 476-77; see also Conn. Code Evid. § 
4-5 (b) (effective January 1, 2012), in 73 Conn. L.J., No. 1, p. 
211PB (July 5, 2011) (codifying propensity exception described 
in DeJesus).
Recognizing the difficulties of balancing the probative value of 
the evidence against its prejudicial effect, we have held that 
HN3 [ ] "the trial court's decision will be reversed only whe[n] 
abuse of [its] discretion is manifest or whe[n] an injustice 
appears to have been done. . . . On review by this court, 
therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in 
favor of the trial court's ruling. . . . State v. Merriam, 264 Conn. 
617, 659-61, 835 A.2d 895 (2003)." (Internal quotation marks 
omitted.) State v. Romero, 269 Conn. 481, 497, 849 A.2d 760 
(2004).
Applying these standards in the present case, we conclude that 
the trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting the 
cases to be tried together because the evidence in all three cases 
was cross admissible.6  [*667]  Turning first to the question of 
6 Because we conclude that the evidence was cross admissible, we need 
not consider whether the trial court properly applied the Boscarino relevancy, it is undisputed that the incidents alleged by C1, C2 
and C3 were proximate in time because all of the alleged 
misconduct occurred between January 1, 2006, and August 31, 
2009. See, e.g., State v. Jacobson, 283 Conn. 618, 632-33, 930 A.2d 
628 (2007) (upholding admission of uncharged 
misconduct [***18]  that occurred approximately six and ten 
years before charged offenses). Second, it cannot reasonably be 
claimed that C1, C2 and C3 are not sufficiently similar 
witnesses. All three victims are prepubescent children of similar 
age who are the defendant's biological children. We are not 
convinced by the defendant's suggestion that the victims cannot 
be deemed similar wit-nesses  [**857]  simply because they do 
not share the same gender. This singular difference does not 
outweigh their shared attributes. See State v. Romero, supra, 269 
Conn. 501 (although victims were different genders, both were 
prepubescent children who were of similar age when abuse 
began and were under defendant's care when it occurred).
Finally, the defendant's conduct with respect to each victim was 
sufficiently similar to demonstrate that he had a propensity 
toward aberrant sexual behavior. See, e.g., State v. DeJesus, supra, 
288 Conn. 474-75. Because [***19]  of the familial relationship, 
the defendant had access to and time alone with each victim. All 
of the sexual abuse occurred during the defendant's 
unsupervised visitation with the victims, either at his residence 
or his mother's residence. The defendant forced all of the 
victims to watch a pornographic movie. Although none of the 
victims needed help bathing, the defendant used the cover of 
bathing in each case as a means of touching them 
inappropriately. In each case, the defendant used a rag to 
maintain the pretense of washing, but, in each case, the 
purported washing resulted in digital anal or vaginal penetration. 
Not only did all three cases involve allegations that the 
defendant had used the rag to camouflage  [*668]  the 
inappropriate digital penetration, but all three victims also 
alleged that the defendant touched them inappropriately when 
he was not using the rag. Lastly, the defendant warned each 
victim not to tell anyone about his conduct. Given the extensive 
similari-ties between the conduct in the three cases, and in view 
of the liberal standard of admissibility governing the use of prior 
misconduct evidence in sexual assault cases, we cannot conclude 
that the trial court abused [***20]  its discretion in denying the 
motion for severance.
We disagree with the Appellate Court's conclusions that "the 
only conduct arguably common to all three victims was the 
defendant's insertion of his finger into their `butts' while they 
factors. State v. LaFleur, supra, 307 Conn. 155 ("[w]here evidence is 
cross admissible . . . our inquiry ends"); State v. Pollitt, 205 Conn. 61, 68, 
530 A.2d 155 (1987) (when evidence is cross admissible, "the defendant 
would not ordinarily be substantially prejudiced by joinder of the 
offenses for a single trial").
321 Conn. 656, *665 ; 138 A.3d 849, **855 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***15

bathed" and that C1's allegations "reflect[ed] significant 
qualitative differences from the facts alleged in the cases 
involving C2 and C3 . . . ." State v. Devon D., supra, 150 Conn. 
App. 529. Specifically, the Appellate Court focused on the 
following differences: (1) C1 alleged that the defendant was 
partially or fully undressed and that some of the abuse occurred 
in the bedroom, whereas C2 and C3 alleged that he remained 
clothed and that all of the abuse occurred in the bathroom; (2) 
C1 alleged penile penetration and fellatio, in addition to digital 
penetration; and (3) the "alleged conduct toward C1 [unlike the 
conduct toward C2 and C3] in no way could have been mistaken 
for an aggressive bathing practice." Id., 528.
With respect to the similarity of the charged and uncharged 
misconduct, this court has repeatedly recognized that it HN4 [
] "need not be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a 
signature . . . ." (Internal quotation marks omitted) State v. Gupta, 
297 Conn. 211, 228-29, 998 A.2d 1085 (2010). Rather, the 
question is whether the evidence is sufficiently similar [***21]  
to demonstrate a propensity "to engage in the type of aberrant 
and compulsive criminal sexual behavior with which he . . . 
[was] charged." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 224. 
 [*669]  As we discussed previously in this opinion, the 
defendant engaged in multiple types of similar conduct with all 
three victims. The fact that the defendant was unclothed during 
his abuse of C1 and engaged in additional types of sexual 
misconduct with her does not outweigh these numerous 
similarities  [**858]  or erode the probative value of that 
evidence.
In addition, the fact that the defendant engaged in additional 
types of sexual misconduct with C1 does not render his conduct 
with her so much more severe and shocking than his conduct 
with C2 and C3 that severance is required. As the trial court 
noted, the allegations in all three cases were shocking, and the 
defendant's inappropriate touching and digital penetration of all 
three victims can only be characterized as severe. The fact that 
the defendant engaged in additional types of sexual misconduct 
with C1 does not render the defendant's conduct toward C2 and 
C3 any less severe. Even if the conduct toward C1 was 
significantly more egregious than his conduct toward 
C2 [***22]  and C3, however, this court previously has upheld 
the admission of uncharged sexual misconduct when it differed 
in degree from the charged conduct. See, e.g., State v. Jacobson, 
supra, 283 Conn. 637-38; State v. McKenzie-Adams, 281 Conn. 
486, 530-33, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S. Ct. 
248, 169 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2007).
In Jacobson, the defendant hockey coach, Scott Jacobson, 
developed close relationships with two boys, M and B. State v. 
Jacobson, supra, 283 Conn. 622-23. He met with them frequently, 
gave them gifts, became friends with their mothers, invited them 
to sleep at his home and slept in the same bed with them. Id. M alleged that, during a sleepover, he awoke to find Jacobson 
performing oral sex on him. Id., 623. B alleged that, during a 
sleepover, he awoke to find Jacobson touching his penis with 
his hands and his mouth. Id., 624. B also alleged that, on 
subsequent occasions, Jacobson forced  [*670]  B to touch his 
penis and attempted to have B sodomize him. Id., 625. During 
trial, the court permitted K, the mother of a boy who had been 
involved in a close relationship with Jacobson, to testify as 
evidence of a common scheme or plan. Id., 628-30. On appeal, 
this court rejected Jacobson's claim that K's allegations were not 
sufficiently similar to the allegations by M and B. See id., 637. 
We concluded that, "although [Jacobson] never sexually 
assaulted K's son, K's description of [Jacobson's] 
relationship [***23]  with and actions toward her son-in 
particular, sleeping in the same bed with him at [Jacobson's] 
home-was sufficient to permit an inference that [Jacobson] was 
grooming K's son for the same kind of sexual abuse that 
[Jacobson] later inflicted on M and B." Id.
In McKenzie-Adams, the defendant high school teacher, Van 
Clifton McKenzie-Adams, was charged with multiple counts of 
sexual assault in connection with his relationships with two 
female students, N.R. and P.L. See State v. McKenzie-Adams, 
supra, 281 Conn. 490-91. The relationship with both victims 
began with intimate conversations in the school library, 
proceeded to embraces in the school hallway and ultimately 
resulted in sexual relations. See id., 491-95. The state also 
introduced the testimony of a third student, R.S., who testified 
that she and P.L. had had a conversation of a sexual nature with 
McKenzie-Adams in the school library and that he had 
embraced her in a sexual manner in the school hallways on 
several occasions. Id., 528. We concluded that the trial court 
properly exercised its discretion in admitting the testimony of 
R.S. as evidence of a common scheme or plan because 
McKenzie-Adams' sexual misconduct with R.S. was similar to 
his sexual misconduct during the initial stages of his [***24]  
relationships with both N.R. and P.L. See id., 530-31.
 [**859]  In the present case, the sexual misconduct in each 
case was much closer in degree of severity than in  [*671]  
Jacobson and McKenzie-Adams. If anything, the basis for the cross 
admissibility of the evidence in the present case is stronger than 
in Jacobson or McKenzie-Adams given the extensive similarities 
between the victims and their allegations. Moreover, our 
holdings in State v. Gupta, supra, 297 Conn. 229, and State v. Ellis, 
270 Conn. 337, 358, 852 A.2d 676 (2004), are consistent with 
our conclusion that the evidence was cross admissible. In both 
of those cases, the charged and uncharged misconduct did not 
share the significant similarities that are present here. In Ellis, 
two of the victims, Julia S. and Kristin C., played softball for the 
defendant coach, Robert Ellis, and alleged that he had touched 
their breasts inappropriately. State v. Ellis, supra, 344-46. The 
third victim, Sarah S., did not play softball on Ellis' team but 
321 Conn. 656, *668 ; 138 A.3d 849, **857 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***20
Page 9 of 14
was connected to him through her sister and her father. Id., 346. 
Ellis' conduct toward her started with explicit telephone 
conversations and then became physical. See id., 347-48. Ellis' 
behavior progressed from touching Sarah S. inappropriately, to 
exposing himself to her and attempting to force her to touch 
him with her hands and mouth, to digital penetration [***25]  
of her vagina and attempted penile penetration. Id., 347-49. This 
court emphasized that "there were few similari-ties" between 
Ellis' abuse of Sarah S. and the other two victims. Id., 358.
Similarly, in Gupta, we specifically recognized that there were 
few similarities between the victims and the conduct alleged. In 
that case, the defendant physician, Sushil Gupta, touched two 
patients' breasts inappropriately during a medical examination. 
State v. Gupta, supra, 297 Conn. 215-17. With the third victim, 
who had been employed by Gupta's medical group for four 
years, Gupta engaged in far more overtly sexual behavior. See 
id., 217-19. In Gupta, as in Ellis, we emphasized the lack of 
similarity between the charged and the uncharged misconduct, 
emphasizing that "the only conduct  [*672]  common to all 
three victims" was that Gupta had felt the victims' breasts with 
his fingertips and grabbed them. Id., 226. In both cases, the 
uncharged misconduct had limited relevance because it shared 
virtually no similarities with the charged misconduct. That is not 
the case here.
Finally, we strongly disagree that, if the cases had been tried 
separately, the defendant in the present case could have raised a 
plausible claim that he was merely bathing C2 and C3. Cf. id., 
222-33 (Gupta arguably could [***26]  assert that improper 
touching of two victims' breasts was part of legitimate medical 
exam whereas his improper sexual comments and more overtly 
sexual acts toward third victim clearly did not constitute 
legitimate medical procedure). Notably, the defendant never 
claimed that joinder impaired his ability to assert such a theory 
with respect to C2 and C3, only that it made it likely that the 
jury would aggregate the evidence. Therefore, the state did not 
have an opportunity to make a proffer as to why such a claim 
would not be plausible. Accordingly, in view of the evidence 
presented by the state, it is clear that the facts simply would not 
support this assertion. C2, who was nine years old at the time of 
the abuse, testified that he had been bathing himself since he 
was five years old, that nothing had happened to make him 
especially dirty before the defendant bathed him, that the 
defendant never said anything to indicate that he was showing 
C2 how to clean himself appropriately, and that the defendant 
penetrated  [**860]  his anus in such a manner as to cause pain. 
C2 also testified that, on more than one occasion, the defendant 
touched C2's penis without the rag and made it go "up and 
down." [***27]  C3, who was ten years old at the time of the 
abuse, offered similar testimony as to all of these circumstances, 
including that the defendant squeezed C3's penis and 
manipulated the foreskin of his penis on several occasions and for  [*673]  sufficient duration to cause pain. Given these 
allegations, the defendant could not make a credible claim that 
he was merely vigorously bathing C2 and C3.
Having determined that the misconduct evidence was relevant 
to prove that the defendant had a propensity to engage in 
aberrant sexual behavior, we turn to whether the prejudicial 
value of the evidence outweighed its probative value. The 
defendant claims that the trial court did not address whether the 
prejudicial value of the evidence outweighed its probative value. 
He also claims that the trial court's instructions "exacerbated" 
the prejudicial effect of the misconduct evidence because "[t]he 
jury was told that [it was] to consider such evidence only to 
show that the defendant has a propensity to commit sex 
offenses." We disagree with both claims.
"We previously have held that HN5 [ ] the process of 
balancing probative value and prejudicial effect is critical to the 
determination of whether other crime[s] evidence is 
admissible. [***28]  . . . At the same time, however, we . . . do 
not . . . requir[e] a trial court to use some talismanic phraseology 
in order to satisfy this balancing process. Rather . . . in order for 
this test to be satisfied, a reviewing court must be able to infer 
from the entire record that the trial court considered the 
prejudicial effect of the evidence against its probative nature 
before making a ruling." (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; 
internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. James G., 268 Conn. 
382, 395, 844 A.2d 810 (2004). In conducting this balancing test, 
the question before the trial court "is not whether [the evidence] 
is damaging to the defendant but whether [the evidence] will 
improperly arouse the emotions of the jur[ors]." (Internal 
quotation marks omitted.) State v. Smith, 275 Conn. 205, 218, 
881 A.2d 160 (2005).
In the present case, we are satisfied that the trial court weighed 
the prejudicial effect of the evidence  [*674]  against its 
probative value before ruling on the motion to sever. The court 
acknowledged the shocking nature of the allegations and 
recognized their potential effect on the jurors. The court also 
considered the interests of judicial economy, the effect of the 
trial on the child victims, the applicable case law and the ability 
to use cautionary instructions to mitigate any prejudice 
stemming [***29]  from the shocking nature of the evidence. 
Only after balancing these numerous factors did the trial court 
deny the motion for severance.
We also reject the defendant's claim that the trial court's 
cautionary instructions "exacerbated" any prejudice to the 
defendant by informing the jurors that they could consider the 
uncharged misconduct evidence "only" to show that the 
defendant had a propensity to engage in such conduct. We do 
not agree that the defendant has properly characterized the trial 
321 Conn. 656, *671 ; 138 A.3d 849, **859 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***24
Page 10 of 14
court's instruction,7 and, even if we did, there is no merit to this 
claim because DeJesus stands for the proposition that HN6 [ ] 
uncharged misconduct evidence in sexual assault cases "may be 
admitted in sex crime cases  [**861]  to establish that the 
defendant had a tendency or a propensity to engage in aberrant 
and compulsive criminal sexual behavior"; State v. DeJesus, supra, 
288 Conn. 476; and requires a cautionary instruction to that 
effect. Id., 477.
In sum, we conclude that the trial court properly [***30]  
exercised its discretion in permitting the three cases against the 
defendant to be tried jointly. The defendant cannot demonstrate 
that he was substantially prejudiced by the denial of his motion 
for severance because the evidence in all three cases would have 
been cross admissible to show that the defendant had a 
tendency  [*675]  or a propensity to engage in aberrant and 
compulsive sexual misconduct.
II
The second issue in this certified appeal is whether the 
Appellate Court correctly concluded that the trial court had 
abused its discretion in permitting a dog to sit near C1 during 
her testimony to provide comfort and support. The state 
challenges the Appellate Court's conclusion, arguing that the 
trial court properly exercised its discretion by balancing its 
determination that the dog's presence likely would help C1 to 
provide complete and reliable testimony against the possibility 
of prejudice to the defendant. We agree with the state.
The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our 
resolution of this claim. On July 5, 2011, the state filed a motion 
to permit a dog "to sit in close proximity to [C1] during [C1's] 
testimony, provided that such dog and the dog's handler 
shall [***31]  not obscure [C1] from the view of the defendant 
or the jury . . . ." The state filed the motion after C1, who was 
eight years old at the time of trial, "had indicated to the victim 
witness advocate that she was concerned about people looking 
at her in the courtroom . . . ." Recognizing that the state's 
motion presented an issue of first impression in Connecticut, 
the court determined that it would conduct a full evidentiary 
hearing in accordance with State v. Jarzbek, 204 Conn. 683, 704, 
529 A.2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 
1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988), and would "apply the more 
exacting standard of clear and convincing [evidence] . . . ." The 
court emphasized that its "reading of the case law indicate[d] 
that [the hearing] might not be necessary, but it appears to be 
the more prudent course of action . . . ." The state did not 
object to the hearing but noted that it did not believe a hearing

instructions and does not cite to any specific language in the charge. In 
addition, defense counsel did not object or take exception to the trial 
court's instructions to the jury at trial.was necessary.
 [*676]  During the hearing, David Meyers, a licensed clinical 
social worker, testified that approximately 40 percent of his 
practice during the previous ten years had involved the 
treatment of child trauma victims, including victims of sexual 
assault. He testified that the dog that would sit near C1 during 
her testimony, Summer, had been trained to be a service dog 
and occasionally provided [***32]  support to children in his 
practice who experienced anxiety. At the time of trial, Summer 
had not yet been certified as a service dog8 because she had only 
just reached the testing age of two. Meyers testified that he and 
Summer met C1 two hours before the hearing began. C1 initially 
refused to touch Summer but "became more and more 
comfortable as she began to pet her. She even touched her teeth 
and . . . sat with her on the floor and . . . appeared to be more 
 [**862]  connected and less fearful." Meyers explained that, in 
his practice, Summer "decreases people's level of anxiety, and 
she increases people's ability to engage and share difficult life 
situations." Meyers testified that he saw a similar response with 
C1 and that Summer's presence increased C1's ability to engage, 
to answer questions and to talk. After spending one hour with 
Summer, C1 was "more visibly relaxed, she was able to talk to 
[the prosecutor], she was able to talk to me about anecdotes 
about Summer and [was] visibly comfortable." According to 
Meyers, C1 said that having Summer near her would "help her 
feel more comfortable." When defense counsel asked Meyers 
whether he had any way of knowing "whether . . . [C1 
would] [***33]  be able to be more truthful, more reliable, have 
better memory of events that are a couple of years old with the 
presence of a dog or without a dog," Meyers responded that, in 
his experience,  [*677]  "when kids are anxious, they're less 
likely to be able to talk about those things, memories and life 
experiences. [C1] appeared less anxious during our time, so I'm 
not sure if that's a clear answer to your question, but it would be 
my opinion, as a dog handler child therapist, that she appeared 
more comfortable." In response to questioning from the court, 
Meyers explained that Summer would be able to lay still for five 
or six hours.
Defense counsel objected to the dog's presence, arguing that 
General Statutes § 54-86g (b),9 which enumerates the 
8 As the Appellate Court noted in its decision, there is a difference 
between service dogs, comfort dogs, therapy dogs, companion dogs 
and facility dogs, and these and additional terms are often used 
interchangeably. See State v. Devon D., supra, 150 Conn. App. 538 n.10. 
Hereinafter, we use the term "dog" or refer to Summer by name.
9 General Statutes § 54-86g (b) provides: HN7 [ ] "In any criminal 
prosecution of an offense involving assault, sexual assault or abuse of a 
child twelve years of age or younger, the court may, upon motion of 
the attorney for any party, order that the following procedures be used 
321 Conn. 656, *674 ; 138 A.3d 849, **860 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***29
Page 11 of 14
procedures that a court may employ when a child testifies in a 
sexual assault case, does not contemplate the use of dogs. In 
response to questioning from the trial court, defense counsel 
clarified that he [***34]  was not making a confrontation clause 
claim.10 Rather, he claimed that the defendant's due process 
rights would be prejudiced because Summer's presence would 
improperly influence the jury by making it appear that C1 is 
someone with whom the jury should sympathize. Counsel 
suggested alternative procedures, such as having C1 testify 
outside the presence of the jury on closed circuit television or 
letting her hold a teddy bear or  [*678]  letting a trusted adult sit 
by her during her testimony. He also requested a curative 
instruction in the event that the court permitted Summer to be 
present. The state emphasized that it had considered counsel's 
suggestion to permit GF to sit with C1 but opted not to do so 
because the theory of the defense was that GF had coached her 
children to make false allegations against the defendant and 
because the procedure would defeat any sequestration order. 
The state also emphasized that the court possessed the inherent 
discretionary authority, "separate  [**863]  and apart from [§ 
54-86g]," to permit C1 to testify with Summer nearby. Although 
the state also had prepared a motion to permit C1 to testify 
outside of the courtroom, it indicated that it would not pursue 
that more drastic measure unless it became [***35]  necessary.
Following [***36]  the hearing, the court recognized the need 
to "balance the [defendant's] due process rights . . . against the 
need to provide an atmosphere in which all witnesses can testify 
and provide the truth reliably, fully and completely," and 
emphasized that the defendant was "entitled to the jury's direct 
observation of all witnesses." The court opined that permitting 
Summer to be present would prevent "the need for the more 
drastic and onerous" procedure of video recording C1's 
testimony.
After taking these considerations into account and applying a 
standard of clear and convincing evidence, the court concluded 
when the testimony of the child is taken: (1) Persons shall be 
prohibited from entering and leaving the courtroom during the child's 
testimony; (2) an adult who is known to the child and with whom the 
child feels comfortable shall be permitted to sit in close proximity to 
the child during the child's testimony, provided such person shall not 
obscure the child from the view of the defendant or the trier of fact; (3) 
the use of anatomically correct dolls by the child shall be permitted; 
and (4) the attorneys for the defendant and for the state shall question 
the child while seated at a table positioned in front of the child, shall 
remain seated while posing objections and shall ask questions and pose 
objections in a manner which is not intimidating to the child."
10 We agree with the Appellate Court's conclusion that the defendant 
waived any right to assert that Summer's presence violated his 
constitutional right of confrontation. See State v. Devon D., supra, 150 
Conn. App. 538 n.9.that it "should allow all reasonable tools to make the courtroom 
a place of comfort and reliability for any witness, but especially a 
child witness, who, it is alleged, has faced child sexual abuse." 
The court concluded that permitting Summer to be present was 
within its discretion, that C1's testimony would be assisted, but 
not directed, by Summer's presence, and that the defendant's 
rights would not be prejudiced by Summer's presence with 
proper curative instructions and safeguards. The court directed 
that Summer would  [*679]  be "put in place [on the witness 
stand] . . . in such a way that [***37]  the dog will not be 
viewed by the jury in any way, shape or form,"11 and solicited 
suggestions from counsel with respect to additional safeguards 
and curative instructions. Subsequently, counsel stipulated that 
the instructions would indicate that "[t]he witness is anxious 
about testifying in front of a group of people. The dog is not 
present due to any concern the witness has with the defendant's 
presence. The . . . dog met the witness [the day before] in 
preparation for court trial." The jury heard these instructions 
when the trial commenced, just before C1 testified, and as part 
of the court's final charge. Each time the court offered these 
instructions, it also admonished the jurors to disregard the 
presence of the dog, to draw no inference for or against any 
witness using a dog, that sympathy should play no part in its 
considerations or ultimate deliberation, and to "[t]hink of the 
dog like an interpreter, an aid to get the witness' testimony 
across to you more clearly."
On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that 
the trial court's ruling constituted an abuse of discretion and 
violated his confrontation and due process rights. See State v. 
Devon D., supra, 150 Conn. App. 516, 538 and n.9. The 
Appellate Court concluded that, although the trial court had the 
inherent discretionary authority, apart from § 54-86g, to permit 
Summer to sit near C1 while she testified, "the court abused its 
discretion in granting the state's motion to [use this procedure] . 
. . because there was no finding [or] . . . a showing . . . that this 
special procedure was  [*680]  needed."12 Id.,  [**864]  549. 
11 The record indicates that Summer was, in fact, put into place on the 
stand, out of view, before the jurors entered the courtroom for C1's 
testimony. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the jurors ever 
saw Summer, [***38]  and the defendant does not claim that the jurors 
ever viewed the dog.
12 The Appellate Court concluded that the defendant had waived his 
claim that the trial court's ruling violated his constitutional right of 
confrontation; State v. Devon D., supra, 150 Conn. App. 538 n.9; see 
footnote 10 of this opinion; and noted that, because the cases were 
being remanded for new trials, there was no need to consider whether 
any possible prejudice to the defendant had been cured by the trial 
court's instructions. State v. Devon D., supra, 550 n.13. Those questions 
are not before us in this certified appeal, which is limited to whether 
the Appellate Court properly determined that the trial court had abused 321 Conn. 656, *677 ; 138 A.3d 849, **862 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***33
Page 12 of 14
Although the Appellate Court held that a showing of need was 
required, it did not discuss what constitutes a showing of need. 
The defendant argues, on appeal to this court, that, under State 
v. Jarzbek, supra, 204 Conn. 704, the state was required to prove 
a compelling need for Summer's presence. The state argues, to 
the contrary, that the procedures in Jarzbek do not apply under 
these circumstances and that "the question on appeal is whether 
the trial court abused its discretion in balancing the likelihood 
that the accommodation—in this case, the . . . dog—would help 
[C1] testify truthfully and completely by [***39]  reducing . . . 
her stress or trauma against the potential for prejudice to the 
defendant." We agree with the state. After considering the 
record and relevant authority, we conclude that the trial court 
properly exercised its discretion in granting the state's motion 
for special procedures.
Whether a trial court may permit a dog to sit near a witness 
during testimony in a criminal trial to provide comfort and 
support presents a question of first impression  [*681]  for this 
court. With respect to statutory authority for such a procedure, 
we agree with the Appellate Court's analysis and conclusion that 
§ 54-86g (b) does not specifically authorize the use of a dog. See 
State v. Devon D., supra, 150 Conn. App. 541-42. As the 
Appellate Court noted, although § 54-86g enumerates various 
special procedures that the court may use when a child testifies 
in a case involving sexual assault or abuse, it does not list the use 
of a dog among the authorized procedures. Id., 542.
We further agree with the Appellate Court's conclusion that, 
HN8 [ ] although § 54-86g does not authorize such a 
procedure, the trial court has inherent discretionary authority, 
separate and apart from the statute, to order special [***41]  
procedures or accommodations to assist a witness in testifying. 
See id., 543. As the Appellate Court recognized, it is well 
established that HN9 [ ] "[t]he function of the court in a 
criminal trial is to conduct a fair and impartial proceeding. . . . A 
trial judge in a criminal case may take all steps reasonably 
necessary for the orderly progress of the trial. . . . When the 
rights of those other than the parties are implicated, [t]he trial 
judge has the responsibility for safeguarding both the rights of 
the accused and the interests of the public in the administration 
its discretion in permitting Summer to sit near C1 while she testified. 
To the extent that the defendant has referred to these issues in his 
brief, both claims are unavailing. Not only do we agree with the 
Appellate Court's conclusion that the defendant waived any 
confrontation clause claim, but there is nothing in the record to suggest 
that Summer's presence interfered with the ability [***40]  of defense 
counsel to view or cross-examine C1, or interfered with the jury's view 
of C1. Similarly, although the defendant makes the blanket statement 
that he was harmed by Summer's presence because it "implied that C1 
had been traumatized . . . made her more sympathetic . . . [and] implied 
she [was] telling the truth," he refers to nothing in the record to 
substantiate this statement.of criminal justice. . . . Moreover, [t]he [ability] of a witness [to 
testify reliably] is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the 
trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of 
abuse or of some error in law." (Internal quotation marks 
omitted.) Id., quoting State v. Torres, 60 Conn. App. 562, 569-70, 
761 A.2d 766 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 925, 767 A.2d 100 
(2001). The trial court may, for example, exercise its discretion 
 [**865]  to permit a child to bring a special doll or comfort 
object from home. See State v. Aponte, 249 Conn. 735, 744-45, 
738 A.2d 117 (1999); see also State v. Torres, supra, 569 (court did 
not abuse its discretion in permitting witness' fiancé to sit beside 
her  [*682]  while she testified); State v. McPhee, 58 Conn. App. 
501, 506-508, 755 A.2d 893 (court did not abuse its discretion in 
permitting witness to hold stuffed animal while 
testifying), [***42]  cert. denied, 254 Conn. 920, 759 A.2d 1026 
(2000). We therefore agree with the Appellate Court's 
conclusion that the trial court possessed the broad discretionary 
authority to order special procedures to ensure that C1 was able 
to testify reliably.
We disagree, however, with the Appellate Court's conclusion 
that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting C1 to 
testify with Summer at her feet. State v. Devon D., supra, 150 
Conn. App. 550. Specifically, we disagree with the Appellate 
Court's conclusion that the trial court was required to make an 
express finding that "there was a need for this special procedure to be 
implemented for C1, and that use of such special procedure 
would not deny the defendant a fair trial." (Emphasis in 
original.) Id. We conclude that the pivotal question is not 
whether the special procedure is necessary but whether it will 
aid the witness in testifying truthfully and reliably.13 We further 
conclude that the record in the present case demonstrates that 
the trial court expressly found that Summer would help C1 to 
testify more reliably and completely and that Summer's presence 
would not violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Finally, the 
record indicates that the trial court took extensive measures to 
ensure that the jurors [***43]  never saw Summer. On the basis 
of the record, we conclude that the trial court properly exercised 
its discretion.
We start our analysis by clarifying the applicable standard of 
review. HN10 [ ] Although we apply an abuse of discretion 
standard to review the trial court's decision to permit Summer 
to sit near C1 during her testimony, we  [*683]  engage in 
plenary review with respect to the standard and procedures that 
the trial court used in making this determination. See, e.g., In re 
Tayler F., 296 Conn. 524, 537, 995 A.2d 611 (2010). With respect 
to those standards and procedures, the defendant argues that 
13 Because truthful and reliable testimony is an essential component of 
a fair trial, a finding that an accommodation will help a witness to 
testify more reliably also constitutes a finding that the accommodation 
is necessary.
321 Conn. 656, *680 ; 138 A.3d 849, **864 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***38
Page 13 of 14
the trial court was required to find, by clear and convincing 
evidence, that the state had shown a compelling need for the use 
of Summer. See State v. Jarzbek, supra, 204 Conn. 707. The state 
contends that the compelling need test set forth in Jarzbek is not 
applicable because the defendant's right of confrontation is not 
at issue. We agree with the state and conclude that the 
appropriate standard is whether the trial court has balanced the 
extent that the special accommodation [***44]  will aid the 
reliability of the witness' testimony against any possible 
prejudice to the defendant's right to a fair trial.
Because this court has not considered the appropriate standards 
and procedures that apply in this precise context, we turn to 
other jurisdictions for guidance. In the five cases in which 
courts have considered challenges to a trial court's decision to 
permit a dog to sit with a testifying witness to provide comfort 
and support, all have concluded that the trial court may exercise 
its discretion to permit such an accommodation. See People v. 
Chenault, 227 Cal. App. 4th 1503, 1517, 175 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 
(2014), review denied, California Supreme Court, Docket No. 
S220741, 2014 Cal. LEXIS 9759 (Cal.  [**866]  October 15, 
2014); People v. Spence, 212 Cal. App. 4th 478, 517, 151 Cal. Rptr. 
3d 374 (2012), review denied, California Supreme Court, Docket 
No. S208415, 2013 Cal. LEXIS 3209 (Cal. April 10, 2013); People 
v. Tohom, 109 App. Div. 3d 253, 266-67, 969 N.Y.S.2d 123 
(2013), appeal denied, 22 N.Y.3d 1203, 9 N.E.3d 918, 986 
N.Y.S.2d 423 (2014); State v. Jacobs, 2015-Ohio-4353, 2015 WL 
6180908, *6 (Ohio App. 2015), appeal denied, 145 Ohio St. 3d 
1406, 2016 Ohio 899, 46 N.E.3d 701 (2016); State v. Dye, 178 
Wn. 2d 541, 553-55, 309 P.3d 1192 (2013). As the court noted 
in  [*684]  Jacobs, "[t]hese cases reveal three principles that guide 
us . . . . First, HN11 [ ] trial courts are in the best position to 
determine how to control trial proceedings, especially the mode 
of interrogating witnesses. Second, in light of the trial courts' 
position and their discretion, it is not erroneous for them to 
approve a variety of special allowances for child victims of 
sexual abuse. And, third, these special allowances [***45]  may 
include using a . . . dog during the child victim's testimony under 
certain circumstances." State v. Jacobs, 2015-Ohio-4353, supra, *6.
In each of these cases, the appellate court upheld the trial 
court's exercise of discretion when it was clear from the record 
that the dog's presence "would likely assist or enable [the 
witnesses] to testify completely and truthfully without undue 
harassment or embarrassment"; People v. Chenault, supra, 227 Cal. 
App. 4th 1520; would make the witness feel "`more 
comfortable'"; State v. Jacobs, 2015-Ohio-4353, supra, 2015 WL 
6180908, *6; would alleviate the witness' anxiety and help her to 
more easily discuss the conduct at issue; People v. Tohom, supra, 
109 App. Div. 3d 267; or would serve to facilitate the testimony 
of a witness who was significantly anxious about testifying and 
who had developmental disabilities. State v. Dye, supra, 178 Wn. 
2d 554, 557.In Chenault, the California Court of Appeal held that "[i]nstead 
of requiring a case-specific finding that an individual witness 
needs the presence of a . . . dog . . . in exercising its discretion . . 
. a trial court should consider the particular facts of the case and 
the circumstances of each individual witness and determine 
whether the presence of a . . . dog would assist or enable that 
witness to testify without undue harassment or embarrassment 
and provide complete and truthful testimony. . . . If the trial 
court finds that the [***46]  presence of a . . . dog would likely 
assist or enable the individual witness to give complete and 
truthful testimony and  [*685]  the record supports that finding, 
the court generally will act within its discretion . . . by granting a 
request for the presence of the . . . dog when that witness 
testifies." (Footnote omitted.) People v. Chenault, supra, 227 Cal. 
App. 4th 1517. After reviewing the record in Chenault, the 
California Court of Appeal held that the trial court properly 
exercised its discretion, noting that it "made implicit findings 
that the presence of [the dog] . . . would assist or enable [the 
child victims] to testify completely and truthfully without undue 
harassment or embarrassment." Id., 1520; see also People v. 
Tohom, supra, 109 App. Div. 3d 256-58, 267 (upholding decision 
to allow dog to accompany child witness during her testimony 
when social worker testified that dog would decrease witness' 
anxiety, allow her to communicate better, and better express 
herself). We find the reasoning in Chenault and Tohom persuasive 
because it focuses the trial court's attention on the central 
question of whether a special accommodation will serve to aid a 
witness in testifying reliably and completely. Such testimony, in 
turn, helps to ensure a fair and impartial trial.
 [**867]  We also agree with the state [***47]  that the 
compelling need standard set in Jarzbek does not apply in the 
present case because the defendant's right of confrontation is 
not at issue. In State v. Jarzbek, supra, 204 Conn. 684, this court 
considered whether a child victim in a case involving alleged 
sexual abuse could testify through the use of a video recording 
made outside the defendant's physical presence. Because this 
procedure necessarily infringed on the defendant's constitutional 
right of confrontation, this court concluded that "a trial court 
must determine, at an evidentiary hearing, whether the state has 
demonstrated a compelling need for excluding the defendant 
from the witness room during the [video recording] of a [child] 
victim's testimony." Id., 704. This court also held that the state 
"bears the burden of proving  [*686]  such compelling need by 
clear and convincing evidence." Id., 705.
The rigorous procedures set forth in Jarzbek are not appropriate 
in the present case because the defendant's right of 
confrontation is not at issue. See, e.g., State v. McPhee, supra, 58 
Conn. App. 507-508 (declining to extend Jarzbek standard to 
case in which defendant claimed special accommodations to 
witness aroused jurors' sympathies). Defense counsel informed 
the trial court that the defendant was not claiming that 
321 Conn. 656, *683 ; 138 A.3d 849, **865 ; 2016 Conn. LEXIS 157, ***43
Page 14 of 14
Summer's [***48]  presence violated his right of confrontation, 
and the defendant makes no claim on appeal that Summer 
interfered with counsel's ability to cross-examine C1 or impeded 
his view or the jury's view of C1. In fact, as the trial court noted, 
permitting Summer to sit near C1 during her testimony was 
intended to obviate the need for the more drastic measure of 
securing C1's testimony by video recording.
We conclude that HN12 [ ] the trial court may exercise its 
discretion to permit a dog to provide comfort and support to a 
testifying witness. Before doing so, the court must balance the 
extent to which the accommodation will help the witness to 
testify reliably and completely against any possible prejudice to 
the defendant's right to a fair trial. The trial court should 
consider the particular facts and circumstances for the request 
to have a dog accompany the particular witness, the extent to 
which the dog's presence will permit the witness to testify 
truthfully, completely and reliably, and the extent to which the 
dog's presence will obviate the need for more drastic measures 
to secure the witness' testimony. The trial court should balance 
these factors against the potential prejudice to the 
defendant [***49]  and the availability of measures to mitigate 
any prejudice, such as limiting instructions and procedures to 
limit the jury's view of the dog.
 [*687]  Applying these standards in the present case, we 
conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in 
permitting Summer to sit near C1 during her testimony. The 
court heard testimony that C1 was anxious about testifying, that 
children who are anxious are less likely to be able to talk about 
their experiences, and that Summer made C1 feel more 
comfortable. Meyers testified that Summer helped C1 to be less 
anxious and more verbal, to engage, to answer questions, and to 
talk. On the basis of this evidence, the court found that C1's 
testimony would be "supported and assisted in an appropriate 
manner by [Summer's] presence . . . ."
The court recognized its duty to "balance the [defendant's] due 
process rights . . . against the need to provide an atmosphere in 
which all witnesses can testify and provide the truth reliably, 
fully and completely." In doing so, the court considered a 
number of factors, including that the defendant was "entitled to 
the jury's  [**868]  direct observation of all witnesses," that a 
dog would not be able to coach C1's testimony, [***50]  and 
that permitting Summer to sit near C1 during her testimony 
would obviate the need for capturing C1's testimony through a 
video recording. After considering these factors, the court 
concluded that the defendant's rights would not be prejudiced 
by Summer's presence. Moreover, the jurors never saw Summer 
because the court excused the jury prior to C1's testimony so 
that Summer would be on the witness stand, out of view, before 
the jury returned. This procedure eliminated the possibility that 
the jurors might be swayed by the presence of "[a] cute little kid with her cute dog," as the defendant feared.14  [*688]  After 
examining the record in the present case, we conclude that the 
trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting 
Summer to sit near C1 during her testimony. We therefore 
reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.
The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is 
remanded to that court with direction to render judgment 
affirming the judgments of the trial court.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.
End of Document
14 The jury was instructed that "[t]he witness [C1] is anxious about 
testifying in front of a group of people. The dog is not present due to 
any concern the witness has with the defendant's presence." The court 
also informed the jurors that C1 had only just met Summer, and that 
they were to disregard Summer's presence and to "[t]hink of the dog 
like an interpreter, an aid [***51]  to get the witness' testimony across 
to you more clearly." To the extent that the defendant now claims that 
the trial court's instructions actually exacerbated any prejudice to the 
defendant, we note that defense counsel specifically requested the 
foregoing instructions.
