Case Summary
Overview
HOLDINGS: [1]-The recordings of interviews of the child 
from 2013 and 2014 were evidence that went directly to the crux 
of the issue, whether the child could describe events about 
which she was being questioned in age-appropriate language, 
and the trial court could use this evidence in assessing her 
competence to testify at trial; [2]-The child's testimony at the 
hearing established that she was competent, and she was also 
able to distinguish the truth from a lie and promised to tell the 
truth; [3]-The trial court found that the comfort dog's presence 
would assist the witness, would not interfere with the 
proceedings, and the dog would remain out of view of the jury 
and wouldn't have a prejudicial impact on the jury; [4]-The trial 
court erred by allowing the State's witness to answer the 
improper question, because the answer wasn't improper, the 
error was harmless.
Outcome
Judgment affirmed in part and remanded in part.

criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to meet 
the witnesses against him face to face, Colo. Const. art. II, § 16. 
The Colorado Constitution secures identical rights as the federal 
right to confrontation. The purpose of the confrontation clause 
is to prevent conviction by ex parte affidavits, to sift the 
conscience of the witness, and to test his recollection to see if 
his story is worthy of belief.

The right of confrontation generally requires that a witness

to observe the witness's demeanor while testifying.

An expert may not opine on a witness's credibility or that a

experts may not offer their direct opinion on a child victim's 
truthfulness or their opinion on whether children tend to 
fabricate sexual abuse allegations.

Although expert testimony isn't permitted to bolster a victim's 
credibility, an expert may testify concerning whether a sexual 
assault victim's behavior or demeanor was consistent with the 
typical behavior of victims of abuse. This type of testimony is admissible because it assists the jury in understanding a child 
victim's behavior after the incident and explains why the victim 
acted the way he or she did. Testimony that provides relevant 
insight into the puzzling aspects of a child's behavior is helpful 
and appropriate in cases of sexual abuse of children.

Syllabus
In this criminal appeal from a conviction for sexual assault on a 
child, a division of the court of appeals addresses an issue of 
first impression: whether the trial court violated defendant's 
confrontation rights when it allowed a child victim to have a 
court facility dog at her feet while she testified during trial. On 
appeal, defendant argues that the presence of the court facility 
dog violated his confrontation rights because the dog's presence 
mitigated this child victim's discomfort about naming defendant 
as her abuser in court, lessening the reliability of her testimony.
Because the division concludes that defendant's right to 
confrontation doesn't carry with it right to impose discomfort 
on an accusing witness, and because the trial court's findings 
that all confrontation requirements were met have record 
support, the division rejects defendant's confrontation claim. 
Because the division also concludes that the other evidentiary 
issues [***2]  that defendant raises on appeal don't warrant 
reversal, the division affirms the convictions. But, because of a clerical error in the mittimus, the division remands the case for 
the limited purpose of correcting the mittimus.

Opinion
 [**441]  [*P1]   We must determine whether the trial court 
violated defendant Cory Collins's confrontation rights when it 
allowed the child victim to have a court facility dog at her feet 
while she testified during trial.
 [*P2]  At the time of the prosecution's motion requesting a 
court facility dog, there was no statutory guidance. But in 2019, 
the General Assembly enacted a statute authorizing the use of 
court facility dogs. We know of no Colorado case, however, that 
has analyzed the defendant's argument here — that the presence 
of the court facility dog violated his confrontation rights.
 [*P3]  Because we conclude that Collins's right to 
confrontation doesn't carry with [***3]  it right to impose 
discomfort on an accusing witness, and because the trial court's 
findings that all confrontation requirements were met have 
record support, we reject Collins's confrontation claim. Because 
we also conclude that the other evidentiary issues that Collins 
raises on appeal don't warrant reversal, we affirm the 
convictions. But, because of a clerical error in the mittimus, we 
remand the  [**442]  case for the limited purpose of correcting 
the mittimus.
I. Background
 [*P4]  Between January 2013 and November 2014, Collins 
sexually abused T.M.1 At the time of the assaults, Collins was in 
a romantic relationship with T.M.'s mother and lived with her 
and T.M. T.M. was between the ages of three and five years old 
at the time of the abuse. At the time, T.M.'s mother had 
unstable housing and was using drugs.
1 During the pre-trial investigation, T.M.'s name changed from T.M. to 
E.W. She is referenced by both names in the record. For the sake of 
consistency and simplicity, we refer to her as T.M. in this opinion.
2021 COA 18, *18 ; 491 P.3d 438, **438 ; 2021 Colo. App. LEXIS 266, ***1
Page 5 of 13
 [*P5]  In September 2013, the Department of Human Services 
(the Department) contacted T.M.'s biological father, expressing 
concern about T.M.'s living situation with her mother. T.M.'s 
father sought an emergency protective order to take temporary 
custody of her. Shortly thereafter, she began living with her 
father, his wife (T.M.'s step-mother), and their three children. 
Eventually, T.M.'s mother's [***4]  parental rights were 
terminated and T.M. remained in her father's custody.
 [*P6]  Soon after T.M. moved into her father's house, her 
father and step-mother began to suspect that she'd been sexually 
abused when she lived with her mother. T.M. had problems 
urinating and didn't understand the concept of privacy between 
family members. T.M. told her father that she'd "played the S 
game"2 (or "sex game") with someone named "Andy."
 [*P7]  Her father reported T.M.'s disclosure of playing the "S 
game" to police. A forensic interviewer questioned T.M. about 
this in October 2013. T.M. didn't repeat the disclosure regarding 
the "S game" to the interviewer. Because T.M. didn't disclose 
any abuse, police didn't conduct an additional investigation at 
that time.
 [*P8]  In the spring of 2014, T.M. took off her clothes and got 
into bed with her step-brother, who was also a child. Her father 
and step-mother questioned T.M. about this behavior and she 
referred to it as the "S game." T.M. went on to say that she had 
"played the S game" with Collins. When questioned further by 
her father and step-mother, T.M. disclosed that Collins had 
touched her inappropriately. T.M. also told them that she didn't 
like Collins, describing [***5]  him as "gross" and "not safe." 
Her father and step-mother reported these disclosures to the 
Department. But after an initial investigation, the Department 
concluded that the allegations against Collins were unfounded.
 [*P9]  Soon after, T.M. started seeing a counselor. T.M. told 
her counselor that Collins had "touched her privates." Her 
counselor, in turn, reported this to the Department.
 [*P10]  In November 2014, a police detective interviewed T.M. 
T.M. told the detective that Collins had touched her 
inappropriately and was able to draw a picture of his genitals. 
When asked if she had been touched by anyone other than 
Collins, she said no. Based on this information, police arrested 
Collins.
 [*P11]  Collins was charged with two counts of sexual assault 
on a child under age fifteen by one in a position of trust and as a 
pattern of abuse; one count of sexual assault on a child as a 
pattern of abuse; and one count of sexual assault on a child as a 
pattern of abuse.
2 T.M.'s stepmother testified that T.M. explained to her that the "S 
game" is where "[y]ou get naked and you get under the covers." [*P12]  There were two jury trials. The first ended in a mistrial. 
T.M. testified at both trials. Collins didn't testify. His theory of 
defense was that although he never touched T.M. 
inappropriately, T.M. had been sexually abused by "Andy," a 
friend of [***6]  T.M.'s mother who, Collins argued, was a 
known sex offender. Collins contended that T.M. was coerced 
by her mother to accuse him — and not Andy — of touching 
her inappropriately because her mother was angry with him. 
Collins also argued that T.M.'s parents' and therapist's repeated 
questioning about Collins subtly influenced T.M. to name him, 
instead of Andy, as the person who had touched her 
inappropriately.
 [*P13]  The jury found Collins guilty of sexual assault on a 
child and sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust 
(with an  [**443]  additional finding that T.M. was a protected 
person because of her age).3 Collins was sentenced to an 
indeterminate concurrent sentence of four years to life in the 
custody of the Department of Corrections.
II. Analysis
 [*P14]  On appeal, Collins raises four issues. First, Collins 
contends that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing 
T.M. to testify, arguing that she was incompetent due to her age. 
Second, Collins contends that the trial court deprived him of his 
federal and state constitutional right to confrontation by 
allowing a court facility dog (also commonly referred to as a 
comfort or support dog) to sit at T.M.'s feet while she testified. 
Third, [***7]  Collins contends that the trial court erred by 
permitting the prosecutor to ask its expert witness certain 
questions that called for the witness to improperly bolster T.M.'s 
testimony. And fourth, Collins contends that the mittimus must 
be amended to reflect that the pattern of abuse sentence 
enhancer was dismissed.
 [*P15]  We address each issue below and conclude that (1) the 
court didn't abuse its discretion by allowing T.M. to testify; (2) 
the court didn't violate Collins's confrontation rights by allowing 
a court facility dog to sit at T.M.'s feet while she testified; (3) 
although the trial court erred by permitting a prosecution expert 
to answer certain questions, the error was harmless; and (4) the 
case must be remanded to correct the mittimus.
A. T.M.'s Competency to Testify
 [*P16]  First, Collins argues that the trial court abused its 
discretion in two regards when it found T.M. competent to 
testify. First, he contends that the trial court erred when it 
considered previously recorded forensic interviews of T.M. 
while assessing T.M.'s competence to testify. And second, 
3 Before closing argument during the second trial, the prosecution 
moved to dismiss the pattern charges.2021 COA 18, *18 ; 491 P.3d 438, **442 ; 2021 Colo. App. LEXIS 266, ***3
Page 6 of 13
Collins contends that the trial court's factual findings regarding 
T.M.'s competence aren't supported by the record and 
its [***8]  legal conclusion isn't based on the correct legal 
standard. We aren't persuaded.
1. Legal Principles
 [*P17]  HN1 [ ] Subject to certain exceptions, all persons are 
competent to be witnesses. See § 13-90-101, C.R.S. 2020; CRE 
601. But children under ten years of age who appear incapable 
of "receiving just impressions" or of relating them truthfully 
aren't legally competent and may not be called as witnesses. § 
13-90-106(1)(a), (b)(I), C.R.S. 2020. A child under ten years of 
age may testify, however, if "the child is able to describe or 
relate in language appropriate for a child of that age the events 
or facts respecting which the child is examined." § 13-90-
106(1)(b)(II).
 [*P18]  HN2 [ ] A trial court "has broad discretion in 
determining how a competency hearing will be held." People v. 
Dist. Ct., 776 P.2d 1083, 1087 n.4 (Colo. 1989) (citation omitted) 
(indicating that a competency hearing may be held in the judge's 
chambers if it eases the child's anxiety); see also People v. Trujillo, 
923 P.2d 277, 281 (Colo. App. 1996) ("the manner and scope of 
examination should be left to the sound discretion of the trial 
court").
 [*P19]  HN3 [ ] We review a preserved statutory claim 
regarding competence of a child witness for an abuse of 
discretion. People v. Wittrein, 221 P.3d 1076, 1079 (Colo. 2009); 
People v. Dist. Ct., 791 P.2d 682, 684 (Colo. 1990). A court abuses 
its discretion when its decision is manifestly arbitrary, 
unreasonable, or unfair, or is based on a misapplication of the 
law. People v. Lindsey, 2018 COA 96M, ¶ 5, 461 P.3d 553.
2. Additional Factual Background [***9] 
 [*P20]  Two months before the first trial, the court conducted 
a competency hearing for T.M., then six years old. During the 
hearing, T.M. answered questions posed by the court, the 
prosecutor, and defense counsel. She accurately stated her age 
and who she lives with. She told the court the names of two of 
her teachers and her best friend. She also corrected defense 
counsel when he misstated  [**444]  the term she uses to refer 
to her grandfather. She explained the difference between the 
truth and a lie and described telling the truth as "right." She said 
that, in her house, "[y]ou get in trouble" for lying.
 [*P21]  During the hearing, the trial court admitted recordings 
of two forensic interviews of T.M.; one conducted in 2013, the 
other in 2014. The prosecution introduced T.M.'s interview 
from 2014, and Collins didn't object. Collins then introduced, 
over the prosecution's objection, a copy of T.M.'s interview 
from 2013. [*P22]  After watching the 2013 interview, the trial court found 
that T.M. was able to identify her favorite colors, knew the 
difference between a "real" bear and a toy bear, and was able to 
identify body parts.
 [*P23]  After watching the 2014 interview, the trial court found 
that T.M. "was able to spell [***10]  her name, able to identify 
other people in her house, and whether the other kids in the 
home were older or younger." The court also found that "when 
asked to explain why she was talking to [police], T.M. stated that 
she was there because [Collins] touched T.M.'s privates and 
T.M. touched [Collins's] privates." Finally, the court found that 
during the 2014 interview, T.M. was able to relate that Collins 
had hair around his genitals. She also demonstrated the way 
Collins's hand moved when he touched her and how her hand 
moved when she touched him.
 [*P24]  In January 2016, the trial court issued a written order, 
concluding that T.M. was competent to testify. In so ruling, the 
court found that T.M. was "sufficiently able to relate events or 
facts in language appropriate for a child her age." The court 
based its ruling on its observations during the competency 
hearing, as well as its review of the recorded forensic interviews 
from 2013 and 2014.
3. Analysis
 [*P25]  First, we consider whether the trial court erred by 
reviewing and considering the two recorded forensic interviews 
when making its competency determination.4
 [*P26]  Collins didn't object to the court's consideration of the 
recorded interviews, [***11]  so we review for plain error.5 
Hagos v. People, 288 P.3d 116, 2012 CO 63, ¶ 14. HN4 [ ] Plain 
error is error that is obvious and that "so undermined the 
fundamental fairness of the trial itself . . . as to cast serious 
doubt on the reliability of the judgment of conviction." Id. 
Collins contends that, while the trial court is granted broad 
discretion to conduct a competency hearing, its discretion 
4 Collins contends that the trial court violated his statutory and 
constitutional confrontation rights but he doesn't explain any further. 
This constitutional argument isn't adequately developed so we won't 
address it. See C.A.R. 28(a)(7)(B); see also People v. Simpson, 93 P.3d 551, 
555 (Colo. App. 2003) (declining to address a "bald legal proposition" 
that isn't developed with supporting argument).
5 As noted above, after the 2014 interview was admitted without 
objection at the prosecutor's request, the 2013 interview was admitted 
at Collins's request. The Attorney General contends that by requesting 
that the court admit the 2013 interview, Collins invited or waived the 
error that he advances on appeal. Collins disagrees. Because we 
conclude that the trial court didn't err (much less plainly err) by 
admitting and considering the forensic interviews, we don't need to 
resolve the issue of whether the alleged error was invited or waived.
2021 COA 18, *18 ; 491 P.3d 438, **443 ; 2021 Colo. App. LEXIS 266, ***7
Page 7 of 13
applies only to the hearing itself, not to recordings taken earlier. 
He also contends, relying on People v. Dist. Ct., 776 P.2d at 1087, 
that the trial court shouldn't have considered the recordings 
because competence at the time of the recordings isn't relevant 
to competency at the time of trial. We aren't persuaded.
 [*P27]  While it's certainly true that competence is evaluated at 
the time of trial, when a challenge to competence is based on a 
witness's youth or immaturity, a demonstration of competence 
earlier is certainly relevant. Thus, the recordings of interviews of 
T.M. from 2013 and 2014 are evidence that go directly to the 
crux of the issue — whether T.M. could describe events about 
which she was being questioned in age-appropriate language. See 
People v. Vialpando, 804 P.2d 219, 224 (Colo. App. 1990). 
Accordingly, the trial court didn't err, much less plainly err, by 
considering T.M.'s two recorded forensic interviews — in 
addition [***12]  to the evidence  [**445]  presented at the 
competency hearing itself — in assessing her competence to 
testify at trial.
 [*P28]  Next, we turn to Collins's contention that trial court 
erred in its application of the competency statute. For the first 
time on appeal, Collins contends that the trial court erred 
because (1) T.M. didn't identify Collins or describe the 
inappropriate touching during the competency hearing and (2) 
the record doesn't support a finding of competence. We reject 
both contentions.
 [*P29]  HN5 [ ] First, a child witness isn't required to 
describe the assailant or the underlying abuse for the trial court 
to make a determination that the child-witness is competent to 
testify. See Trujillo, 923 P.2d at 281; cf. Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 
730, 741, 107 S. Ct. 2658, 96 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1987) ("[Q]uestions 
at a competency hearing usually are limited to matters that are 
unrelated to the basic issues of the trial." (citations omitted)). 
T.M. didn't describe the details of the sexual abuse nor did she 
name Collins as her abuser during the competency hearing. But 
this was for good reason — T.M. was never asked about the 
details of the sexual abuse because these types of questions 
aren't required during a competency hearing. See Stincer, 482 U.S. 
at 741. And while it's not required for a finding of competence, 
we note that during the [***13]  recorded interviews, T.M. 
named Collins as the person who had touched her 
inappropriately.
 [*P30]  Second, the record supports the trial court's finding 
that T.M. was competent to testify. T.M.'s testimony at the 
hearing established that she was able to correctly relate her 
name, her age, the name of her best friend, and the names of 
her family members. See Vialpando, 804 P.2d at 223 (the trial 
court didn't abuse its discretion by finding a child competent to 
testify where the child correctly related her grade in school, the 
defendant's first name, and the date of the sexual assault, and 
could distinguish between truth and a lie). T.M. was also able to distinguish the truth from a lie and promised to tell the truth. See 
id.; see also Stackhouse v. People, 2015 CO 48 ¶¶ 17-18, 386 P.3d 
440; Trujillo, 923 P.2d at 281 (child was competent after she was 
able adequately to relate events or facts, knew the difference 
between the truth and a lie, knew the importance of telling the 
truth, and was able to relate sequences of events).
 [*P31]  Thus, the record demonstrates that T.M. could 
properly answer questions about various facets of her life and 
that she did so in age-appropriate language. Accordingly, the 
trial court didn't abuse its discretion by finding her competent to 
testify at trial.
B. Court Facility [***14]  Dog
 [*P32]  Next, Collins contends that the trial court violated his 
confrontation rights when it allowed a court facility dog to sit at 
T.M.'s feet while she testified. Specifically, Collins contends that 
the dog's presence mitigated T.M.'s discomfort about naming 
Collins as her abuser in court, lessening the reliability of her 
testimony and violating his state and federal confrontation 
rights. Collins also contends that the prosecution failed to 
demonstrate a compelling need for the presence of a court 
facility dog that outweighed his confrontation rights. We aren't 
persuaded.
1. Additional Factual Background
 [*P33]  Before the second trial, the prosecution requested that 
a court facility dog be allowed to sit at T.M.'s feet while she 
testified because she was anxious about testifying.6 Collins filed 
a written objection, arguing, in part, that the use of a court 
facility dog violated his right to confrontation because "the 
process of confrontation necessarily requires a certain level of 
subtle emotional  [**446]  and psychological tension between 
the accused and the witness."
 [*P34]  The trial court conducted a hearing at the prosecution's 
request. The trial court found that the presence of a court 
facility dog [***15]  didn't violate Collins's confrontation rights 
because "confrontation is with the witness" and the court 
facility dog didn't constitute "evidence in the case." The trial 
court additionally found that the dog's presence would be useful 
6 At the time of the prosecution's motion, no statutory provision 
expressly either allowed or prohibited the use of a court facility dog. 
Later, however, the Colorado General Assembly enacted a statute 
authorizing the use of court facility dogs. See § 16-10-404, C.R.S. 2020; 
Ch. 138, sec. 1, § 16-10-404, 2019 Colo. Sess. Laws 1739-40. HN6 [ ] 
That statute provides that a trial court "may, upon motion of a party or 
upon its own motion, order that a witness's testimony be offered while 
a court facility dog is in the courtroom during the testimony of the 
witness" in a criminal proceeding if the court makes certain findings by 
a preponderance of the evidence. § 16-10-404(2)(a).
2021 COA 18, *18 ; 491 P.3d 438, **444 ; 2021 Colo. App. LEXIS 266, ***11
Page 8 of 13
to the efficiency of the trial, as the court observed during the 
first trial that T.M. "somewhat freezes and [had] a hard time 
testifying."7 The trial court also considered the Victims' Rights 
Act, noting that "it is the intent of the Legislature to assure that 
all victims of and witnesses to crimes are honored and protected 
by law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and judges." The trial 
court allowed T.M. to have a court facility dog — a golden 
retriever named Tillie — sit at her feet while she testified. The 
trial court found,
With everything that I have I am going to allow Tillie to be 
present. I do find that it is appropriate. I do find that there has 
been showing that it would assist the child, in this case T.M., aka 
E.W. for testimony. I have viewed Tillie in the courtroom in 
other cases. She has not been a distraction. In one recent case 
she was present with a child victim and quite frankly I 
think she was sleeping. I didn't see nor hear her.
(Emphasis [***16]  added.)
 [*P35]  The court concluded,
In this case I'm going to have Tillie come in early. She will 
be, as much as possible, outside of the view of the jury. There will 
be an instruction that will be given, that the jury is not to 
make any inferences for or against either side due to Tillie's 
presence. I do find that she is professionally trained based 
on a curriculum — at least the documentation that shows 
what her certification is for. She will be leashed.
(Emphasis added.)
 [*P36]  In order to avoid any unfair prejudice towards Collins, 
the trial court arranged for Tillie to sit at T.M.'s feet, outside of 
the jurors' view, while she testified.8
2. Analysis
a. Confrontation
 [*P37]  HN7 [ ] The United States Constitution provides, in 
relevant part, that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused 
shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses 
7 The prosecution's motion noted that the court facility dog was not 
present during T.M.'s previous testimony because no dogs were 
available.
8 The court proposed a jury instruction related to Tillie's presence, but 
it was not given to the jury. The court suggested the instruction was 
unnecessary because Tillie was out of the jurors' view. Both defense 
counsel and the prosecutor agreed that it wasn't needed. The 
prosecutor indicated that the instruction may "draw attention to 
something [the jury is] likely unaware of at this time." Collins doesn't 
challenge on appeal the court's decision not to give the instruction, nor 
does he challenge the procedure that was employed that led to the jury 
being unaware of the dog's presence.against him." U.S. Const. amend. VI. Similarly, the Colorado 
Constitution provides that "[i]n criminal prosecutions the 
accused shall have the right . . . to meet the witnesses against 
him face to face." Colo. Const. art. II, § 16. The Colorado 
Constitution secures identical rights as the federal right to 
confrontation. People v. Phillips, 2012 COA 176, ¶ 56, 315 P.3d 
136. The purpose of the confrontation clause is "to prevent 
conviction by [e]x parte affidavits, to sift the 
conscience [***17]  of the witness, and to test his recollection 
to see if his story is worthy of belief." Id. at ¶ 79 (quoting People 
v. Bastardo, 191 Colo. 521, 524, 554 P.2d 297, 300 (1976)).
 [*P38]  Collins preserved this issue by filing a written 
objection, arguing that the prosecution hadn't established the 
need for a court facility dog and that the dog's presence would 
violate his confrontation rights. HN8 [ ] We review a 
preserved Confrontation Clause issue de novo. People v. McFee, 
412 P.3d 848, 2016 COA 97, ¶ 28.
 [*P39]  HN9 [ ] The right of confrontation generally requires 
that a witness testify under oath, in open court, and face-to-face 
with the defendant. Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 845-46, 110 
S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666  [**447]  (1990). It also requires 
that a witness be subject to cross-examination by defense 
counsel and that the jury have the ability to observe the 
witness's demeanor while testifying. Id.
 [*P40]  Every requirement of confrontation was met here. 
T.M. testified in open court and face-to-face with Collins, she 
took an oath prior to her testimony, she was subject to cross-
examination by defense counsel, and the jury was able to 
observe her demeanor while testifying. Collins doesn't dispute 
this; rather, he focuses on T.M.'s emotional state during her 
testimony.
 [*P41]  Citing Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012, 1020, 108 S. Ct. 2798, 
101 L. Ed. 2d 857 (1988), Collins argues that Tillie's presence 
lessened T.M.'s anxiety about testifying and violated his right to 
confrontation because, he contends, she didn't feel [***18]  the 
"degree of discomfort" a testifying accuser should be subject to. 
See id. ("[C]onstitutional protections have costs."). This 
argument fails.
 [*P42]  We aren't persuaded that Coy informs our analysis. In 
Coy, the Supreme Court analyzed the trial court's decision to 
allow two child sexual assault victims to testify behind a large 
screen that enabled the defendant "dimly to perceive the 
witnesses, but the witnesses to see him not at all." Id. at 1014-15. 
The Court held that the defendant's right to confrontation was 
violated because the screen enabled the witnesses to avoid 
viewing the defendant as they testified. Id. at 1012. In so ruling, 
the Court reasoned that the defendant's presence "may, 
unfortunately, upset the truthful rape victim or abused child; but 
by the same token it may confound and undo the false accuser, 
2021 COA 18, *18 ; 491 P.3d 438, **446 ; 2021 Colo. App. LEXIS 266, ***15
Page 9 of 13
or reveal the child coached by a malevolent adult." Id. at 1019.
 [*P43]  Collins's reliance on Coy is misplaced. Coy doesn't stand 
for the proposition that crime victims must endure stress while 
testifying to satisfy the right to confrontation. HN10 [ ] While 
satisfying a defendant's right to confront his or her accuser may 
impose an unavoidable level of discomfort for the accusing 
witness, the right doesn't carry with it a [***19]  prohibition on 
mitigating discomfort nor a right to impose discomfort. Put 
simply, easing a testifying witness's discomfort doesn't violate a 
defendant's confrontation rights.
 [*P44]  Additionally, T.M. could still physically see Collins 
while she testified. This is unlike the child victims in Coy who 
were entirely shielded from seeing the defendant's face. Here, 
the trial court exercised its special care to assist a young victim 
during her testimony, while still maintaining Collins's right to 
confront T.M. face-to-face.
 [*P45]  And, while no Colorado appellate court has addressed 
whether the presence of a court facility dog violates a 
defendant's confrontation rights, other states' courts have 
rejected this notion. See, e.g., State v. Millis, 241 Ariz. 802, 391 
P.3d 1225, 1233 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2017) ("In keeping with the trial 
court's 'broad discretion' in managing trial conduct, this court 
will not disturb a trial court's ruling regarding the use of a facility 
dog absent an abuse of discretion." (citation omitted)); People v. 
Spence, 212 Cal. App. 4th 478, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 374, 405 (Cal. 
Ct. App. 2012) (trial court "appropriately exercised its 
discretion" by providing a therapy dog in this exercise of 'special 
care to protect [the witness] from undue harassment or 
embarrassment'"); People v. Tohom, 109 A.D.3d 253, 271-73, 969 
N.Y.S.2d 123 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013) (a dog's presence didn't 
violate the defendant's right to confront witnesses, [***20]  
citing the trial court's discretion to "fashion[ ] an appropriate 
measure to address a testifying child witness's emotional or 
psychological stress, based upon the particular needs of that 
child"); State v. Dye, 178 Wn.2d 541, 309 P.3d 1192, 1194 (Wash. 
Ct. App. 2013) (rejecting confrontation challenge, concluding 
that the "trial court acted within its broad discretion when it 
determined that . . . the facility dog provided by the prosecutor's 
office to the victim . . . was needed in light of [the victim]'s 
severe developmental disabilities in order for [the victim] to 
testify adequately"). We agree with these decisions and conclude 
that permitting a witness to testify in the presence of a comfort 
animal doesn't violate a defendant's confrontation rights.
 [**448]  b. Necessity
 [*P46]  Next, Collins argues that the trial court erred by 
allowing Tillie to accompany T.M. without first requiring a 
showing of necessity by the prosecution. HN11 [ ] Whether 
the trial court applied the correct legal standard is a question of law that we review de novo. People v. Triplett, 411 P.3d 1054, 
2016 COA 87, ¶ 28.
 [*P47]  At the time of trial, Colorado didn't have a statute 
governing a party's request for a court facility dog. And there 
isn't any Colorado case law addressing whether a showing of 
necessity is required before a court authorizes the use 
of [***21]  a court facility animal over a party's objection. 
Courts in other jurisdictions, however, have addressed this issue.
 [*P48]  There is a split of outside authority on whether the 
prosecution must prove that a witness needs a specific support 
or comfort item before the court can allow its use or presence 
over the defense's objection. Compare State v. Dickson, 337 
S.W.3d 733, 743 (Mo. Ct. App. 2011) (no showing of necessity 
was required where the witness was testifying about traumatic 
events and no reference was made to the comfort items in the 
jury's presence), and Sperling v. State, 924 S.W.2d 722, 726 (Tex. 
Ct. App. 1996) (no showing of necessity was required, as the 
appellate court couldn't conclude that a comfort item 
"constituted demonstrative evidence which engendered 
sympathy in the minds and hearts of the jury, validated the 
child-victim's unimpeached credibility, or deprived appellant of 
his constitutional right of confrontation"), with Gomez v. State, 25 
A.3d 786, 798-99 (Del. 2011) (adopting "substantial need" 
standard, requiring the prosecution to show that the item is 
necessary to facilitate the witness's testimony), and State v. 
Palabay, 9 Haw. App. 414, 844 P.2d 1, 2 (Haw. Ct. App. 1992) 
(adopting "compelling necessity" standard, requiring the 
prosecution to show that the item is necessary to facilitate the 
witness's testimony).
 [*P49]  The majority of courts in other jurisdictions, however, 
have concluded that [***22]  a finding of necessity isn't 
required. See, e.g., People v. Chenault, 227 Cal. App. 4th 1503, 175 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 11 (Cal. Ct. App. 2014); State v. Devon D., 321 
Conn. 656, 138 A.3d 849, 864 (Conn. 2016); Dickson, 337 
S.W.3d at 743; Tohom, 109 A.D.3d at 266; Sperling, 924 S.W.2d at 
726; Dye, 309 P.3d at 1199; contra Gomez, 25 A.3d at 798-99; 
Palabay, 844 P.2d at 2; State v. Cliff, 116 Idaho 921, 782 P.2d 44, 
45 (Idaho Ct. App. 1989); State v. Hakimi, 124 Wn. App. 15, 98 
P.3d 809, 811 (Wash. Ct. App. 2004) (concluding that the court 
didn't abuse its discretion where the child victim was allowed to 
hold a doll while testifying, due to a "peculiar need find some 
security in an otherwise insecure setting").
 [*P50]  We are persuaded by those cases that have rejected 
requiring the proponent of the use or presence of a comfort 
item or animal to show necessity. HN12 [ ] Requiring a lesser 
showing is consistent with the Victims' Rights Act, as well as the 
considerable latitude that appellate courts afford trial judges in 
controlling courtroom decorum. See, e.g., People v. Marquantte, 923 
P.2d 180, 183 (Colo. App. 1995) ("A court has broad discretion 
to determine what actions are necessary to regulate the 
2021 COA 18, *18 ; 491 P.3d 438, **447 ; 2021 Colo. App. LEXIS 266, ***18
Page 10 of 13
courtroom."); People v. Angel, 790 P.2d 844, 846 (Colo. App. 
1989) ("[A] trial court does have broad discretion to regulate its 
courtroom and has inherent powers to preserve order and to 
prevent interference with or obstruction of justice."). Cf. People v. 
Whitman, 205 P.3d 371, 379 (Colo. App. 2007) ("Providing a 
young, distracted, and emotional witness with an environment 
designed to promote the witness's complete testimony satisfies 
either the overriding or substantial interest standards.").
 [*P51]  Here, the trial court found that (1) Tillie's presence 
would assist the witness; (2) based on prior [***23]  
interactions, Tillie wouldn't interfere with the proceedings; and 
(3) Tillie would remain out of view of the jury and wouldn't 
have a prejudicial impact on the jury. These findings are 
supported by the record, and we conclude that, in the absence 
of a statute imposing a requirement of necessity, no greater 
showing was required.
 [*P52]  Accordingly, the trial court didn't abuse its discretion 
by allowing T.M. to testify with Tillie at her feet. See Tohom, 109 
A.D.3d at 267 (a "judge conducting a public trial is empowered 
to  [**449]  control the proceedings in whatever manner may 
be consistent with the demands of decorum and due process").
C. Expert Testimony
 [*P53]  Collins next contends that the trial court erred by 
admitting portions of an expert's testimony that, he argues, 
improperly bolstered T.M.'s testimony.
1. Additional Factual Background
 [*P54]  During the trial, the prosecution presented testimony 
by Cheryl Young, a therapist. Without objection, the court 
accepted Young as an expert in
￿ child sexual assault and abuse;
￿ reactions of child victims during a sexual assault;
￿ patterns of disclosure in outcry statements of child 
sexual assault and abuse victims;
￿ the forensic protocol of child sexual abuse interviews;
￿ victim/offender [***24]  relationship dynamics;
￿ the process of memory; and
￿ suggestibility and factual situations where false 
allegations and fabrications are common.
Young didn't talk to any of the witnesses or read any of the 
reports from this case.
 [*P55]  Collins contends that portions of Young's testimony 
were inadmissible in two regards. First, he contends that 
Young's opinion that a particular pattern of disclosure isn't 
unusual for a child was impermissible. Second, he contends that 
Young's opinion that it would be uncommon for a child to lie 
about having experienced a sexual assault was impermissible 
bolstering. [*P56]  We agree that in both instances, the prosecutor's line 
of questioning was improper, but we conclude that the trial 
court's decision to allow Young to answer the prosecutor's 
questions was harmless.
2. Applicable Legal Principles
 [*P57]  An expert witness may provide opinion testimony so 
long as "the expert's specialized knowledge will assist the jury in 
understanding the evidence or in determining a fact in issue." 
People v. Mintz, 165 P.3d 829, 831 (Colo. App. 2007).
 [*P58]  HN13 [ ] An expert may not opine on a witness's 
credibility or that a witness was telling the truth on a specific 
occasion. Wittrein, 221 P.3d at 1081 (citing People v. Eppens, 979 
P.2d 14, 17 (Colo. 1999)). Thus, "experts may not offer their 
direct opinion on a child victim's [***25]  truthfulness or their 
opinion on whether children tend to fabricate sexual abuse 
allegations." Id.
 [*P59]  HN14 [ ] Although expert testimony isn't permitted 
to bolster a victim's credibility, an expert may testify concerning 
whether a sexual assault victim's behavior or demeanor was 
consistent with the typical behavior of victims of abuse. People v. 
Glasser, 293 P.3d 68, 78 (Colo. App. 2011). This type of 
testimony is admissible because it assists the jury in 
understanding a child victim's behavior after the incident and 
explains why the victim acted the way he or she did. People v. 
Relaford, 409 P.3d 490, 2016 COA 99, ¶ 28. Testimony that 
provides relevant insight into the "puzzling" aspects of a child's 
behavior "is helpful and appropriate in cases of sexual abuse of 
children." Id. (quoting Whitman, 205 P.3d at 383).
3. Standard of Review
 [*P60]  HN15 [ ] We review a trial court's ruling on the 
admissibility of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. 
Kutzly v. People, 2019 CO 55, ¶ 8, 442 P.3d 838. A trial court 
abuses its discretion when its decision is manifestly arbitrary, 
unreasonable, or unfair, or based on a misapprehension of the 
law. People v. Salas, 405 P.3d 446, 2017 COA 63, ¶ 30.
 [*P61]  Because Collins's counsel objected to Young's 
testimony at trial, this issue is preserved, and we apply harmless 
error review. See Hagos, ¶ 12. HN16 [ ] We will reverse only if 
the error "affects the substantial rights of the parties" — that is, 
the [***26]  error "substantially influenced the verdict or 
affected the fairness of the trial proceedings." Id. (quoting Tevlin 
v. People, 715 P.2d 338, 342 (Colo. 1986)).
 [**450]  [*P62]   We now turn to the portions of Young's 
testimony that Collins challenges.
4. Pattern of Disclosure Expert Testimony
 [*P63]  Collins contends that the trial court abused its 
2021 COA 18, *18 ; 491 P.3d 438, **448 ; 2021 Colo. App. LEXIS 266, ***22
Page 11 of 13
discretion by allowing Young's opinion that a specific pattern of 
disclosure by a child wasn't unusual. The prosecutor questioned 
Young and elicited the following testimony:
[Prosecutor]: Following a situation where there is [sic] 
potentially multiple outcries leading to a forensic interview 
where there's no disclosure, that [sic] then followed by 
subsequent multiple outcries to a number of people, that 
then followed by a forensic interview where there is a 
disclosure, does that in your opinion indicate anything with respect 
to that child's experience?
[Defense counsel]: Objection Your Honor based on my 
previous record.9
THE COURT: At this time the objection is overruled, 
again based on the record made at the bench and the 
question that has been specifically asked.
[Young]: So if I were thinking of a preschool or younger 
child that there is a series of outcries or certain behaviors, a 
formal interview where there may [***27]  not be any kind 
of an outcry to that interviewer, followed by more outcries 
or behaviors, I would not find that process or history unusual in 
that age of a child where there are allegations of sexual abuse.
(Emphasis added.)
 [*P64]  Collins contends that the hypothetical was so closely 
tailored to the facts of the case that Young's answer constituted 
an improper opinion on the veracity of T.M.'s allegations. We 
agree with Collins that the prosecutor's question was improper.
 [*P65]  The facts at issue in the case closely match the 
hypothetical given to Young. T.M. disclosed several times to her 
father and step-mother, but didn't disclose when she was 
interviewed by a police detective. But then T.M. later disclosed 
in an interview with a different police detective.
 [*P66]  The hypothetical therefore invited an improper 
opinion about whether T.M.'s accusations should be believed 
notwithstanding her disclosure pattern. It was calculated to elicit 
an opinion that T.M.'s allegations of abuse were still reliable (i.e., 
that she was telling the truth on a particular occasion). That isn't 
a proper subject for expert testimony. See CRE 608(a)(1); see also 
Venalonzo, ¶ 32 (CRE 608(a) "applies to both direct and indirect 
implications of a child's [***28]  truthfulness"); cf. People v. 
Cernazanu, 410 P.3d 603, 2015 COA 122, ¶ 21 (The "general 
characteristics" of credibility that the witness testified to "were 
not those of a class of victims who had experienced child incest, 
sex assault, rape trauma, or the like. They were, instead, 
9 Defense counsel had previously objected to a similar question from 
the prosecutor, asking Young to opine on a situation in which a 
"preschool aged child . . . crawl[ed] into bed naked with a sibling . . . ." 
The trial court overruled the objection.'characteristics' peculiar to [the victim], which were directly 
indicative of [the victim's] credibility, and which were relevant only 
to ascertaining whether [the victim] was telling the truth on a 
specific occasion." (emphasis in original)).
 [*P67]  HN17 [ ] When a hypothetical is so closely tailored to 
the distinctive facts of the case at hand, as it was here, the 
question ceases to be about any child and, instead, becomes a 
question about the particular child. Cernazanu, ¶ 21. And when 
the question is, as a practical matter, about the child in this case, 
it risks calling for an opinion of the credibility of that particular 
child. Id. Indeed, the prosecutor asked Young to opine on a 
specific child — "does that in your opinion indicate anything 
with respect to that child's experience?" — not just any child. See 
Venalonzo, ¶ 33; People v. Snook, 745 P.2d 647, 649 (Colo. 1987) 
(testimony that another witness is credible on a particular 
occasion is especially problematic where the outcome of the 
case turns on which version [***29]  of that witness's 
conflicting telling of events is worthy of belief).
 [*P68]  While the question on its face was improper, Young's 
answer rendered the court's erroneous decision to permit her to 
 [**451]  answer harmless. Young didn't opine on which 
disclosure was more accurate or should be believed, but simply 
testified that it wasn't unusual for a child to engage in that 
particular disclosure pattern. Young's testimony didn't amount 
to an opinion that T.M. was telling the truth on a particular 
occasion. See Venalonzo, ¶ 33; Snook 745 P.2d at 649. While the 
prosecutor's question ran the considerable risk that it may have 
elicited an improper answer, the answer didn't run afoul of rules 
guiding expert opinion testimony. Thus, even though the trial 
court erred by allowing Young to answer the improper question, 
because the answer wasn't improper, the error was harmless.
5. Sophistication to Lie Expert Testimony
 [*P69]  Next, Collins contends that the court erred when it 
allowed Young to answer the prosecutor's questions regarding a 
child's sophistication to lie about having been sexually assaulted.
 [*P70]  Young testified that "children lie about did they do 
their homework, did they clean their room, did they eat the last 
Pop-Tart that their [***30]  brother was supposed to have. Yes, 
those are common behaviors and they are intended to avoid our 
disappointment and avoid our disapproval." She further 
testified, children are "not sophisticated cognitively" enough to 
plan and calculate a lie against another person. The prosecutor 
then elicited the following testimony:
[Prosecutor]: Based upon your prior answer you had in 
some ways distinguished preschool aged children from 
other groups of children, and so my question to you was 
that if in your opinion do children generally have the 
sophistication to lie about having experienced sexual assault?
2021 COA 18, *18 ; 491 P.3d 438, **450 ; 2021 Colo. App. LEXIS 266, ***26
Page 12 of 13
[Young]: It's kind of on their own volition independent of 
anybody else, do they in a calculated, intentional way make 
up a lie about — in an intentional type of way to get an 
adult into trouble, it's a pretty sophisticated act and the vast 
majority of preschoolers independently or on their own that would be 
uncommon. To say that children can't be influenced or coerced into 
making statements, that's a different set of circumstances. If we're 
talking independently on their own they don't have that 
cognitive sophistication and planning then I would stand 
by that.
(Emphasis added.)
 [*P71]  The prosecutor's [***31]  question to Young is similar 
to the line of questioning that was found to be improper in 
Snook. In Snook, an expert testified that "children tend not to 
fabricate stories of sexual abuse . . . ." Snook, 745 P.2d at 648. 
The court concluded that the question elicited an answer from 
the expert that amounted to improper bolstering of the victim's 
credibility. Id. at 648-49. The court reasoned that the "jury's only 
conceivable use of such testimony would be as support for the 
complainant's truthful character." Id. at 649.
 [*P72]  Similar to Snook, the prosecutor asked Young to 
comment on whether a child was likely to fabricate sexual 
assault. Id. HN18 [ ] Experts "may not offer their direct 
opinion on a child victim's truthfulness or their opinion on 
whether children tend to fabricate sexual abuse allegations." 
Wittrein, 221 P.3d at 1081. And Young's testimony in response 
— that lying about sexual assault to get "an adult into trouble" is 
a "sophisticated act" that would be "uncommon" behavior for a 
child to engage in — amounted to support for T.M.'s credibility. 
Id. Thus, we conclude that the court erred by allowing Young to 
answer the question posed by the prosecutor.
 [*P73]  But the error was ultimately harmless, for three 
reasons.
 [*P74]  First, Young's testimony didn't directly refute [***32]  
Collins's theory of defense. See People v. Kubuugu, 433 P.3d 1214, 
2019 CO 9, ¶ 16 (holding that improperly admitted expert 
testimony wasn't harmless because the expert's testimony "was 
the only evidence that specifically refuted" the defendant's 
exculpatory testimony). The central issue in the case was which 
of T.M.'s disclosures the jury should believe — that she was 
touched inappropriately by "Andy" or by Collins. Collins's 
theory of defense was that T.M. had (1) been abused by Andy 
and (2) then subtly coerced by the adults in her life into naming 
Collins as her abuser. But Young's expert opinion centered on 
whether children have the sophistication to lie about having 
been sexually  [**452]  abused in the first place, not whether 
they lie about the identity of the perpetrator. Indeed, during 
cross-examination, Young made it clear she wasn't opining on 
whether a child could be influenced but whether children can 
craft a lie of their own volition. Simply put, Young's testimony in this regard didn't refute Collins's theory of defense.
 [*P75]  Second, Young's testimony didn't directly refute 
evidence from Collins's own expert. See People v. Casias, 2012 
COA 117, ¶¶ 73-75, 312 P.3d 208 (where experts didn't directly 
dispute one another's testimony, the case was not "sharply 
disputed" and therefore, error [***33]  in admitting expert 
testimony was harmless). Collins called Dr. Esplin to testify how 
children can be influenced to wrongfully name someone as their 
abuser. Dr. Esplin's expert opinion was not refuted by Young's 
expert opinion.
 [*P76]  Third, Young's testimony was brief. The trial lasted 
four days and included the testimony of several experts. 
Additionally, the prosecutor didn't even mention Young's 
testimony related to children's sophistication to lie in his closing 
argument. See Marsh v. People, 389 P.3d 100, 2017 CO 10M, ¶ 42 
(expert testimony didn't contribute to the verdict when the 
prosecutor didn't rely on the testimony during closing 
argument).
 [*P77]  Therefore, we conclude that the testimony didn't 
"substantially influence the verdict or affected the fairness of the 
trial proceedings." Hagos, ¶ 12. Accordingly, its admission 
doesn't warrant reversal.
D. Sentencing
 [*P78]  Finally, Collins contends, for the first time on appeal, 
that the mittimus must be amended. We agree that the case 
must be remanded to correct the mittimus.
 [*P79]  Prior to closing arguments in the case, the prosecution 
moved to dismiss the pattern charges. The trial court struck the 
pattern language from count 2 — sexual assault on a child. 
HN19 [ ] Without the pattern language, sexual assault [***34]  
on a child is a class 4 felony. See § 18-3-405(1), (2), C.R.S., 2020. 
But the mittimus still includes the pattern language on count 2. 
The mittimus must be corrected to reflect the "true nature of 
the crime of which defendant was convicted." People v. Malloy, 
178 P.3d 1283, 1289 (Colo. App. 2008).
 [*P80]  Accordingly, we remand the matter to the trial court 
with directions to correct count 2 of the mittimus to reflect a 
conviction for sexual assault on a child under section 18-3-
405(1), (2), a class 4 felony. See Crim. P. 36 (clerical mistakes in 
judgments may be corrected by the court at any time).
III. Conclusion
 [*P81]  For the reasons set forth above, the judgment and 
sentence are affirmed. The case is remanded for correction of 
the mittimus.
JUDGE J. JONES and JUDGE GOMEZ concur.
