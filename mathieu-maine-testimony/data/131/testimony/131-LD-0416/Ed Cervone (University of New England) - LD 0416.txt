Maine's 10~Year Economic Development Strategy, vetted and supported by stakeholders statewide, makesa 
clear and strong commitment to increasing our ﬁnancial investment in R&D (Action C1). Public dollars playa 
critical role here. Those dollars provide the foundational infrastructure needed to conduct R&D and in turn 
attract matching dollars. These investments attract talent, which in turn creates wealth and opportunity. It 
is this growth loop which will drive the Maine economy, sustaining jobs in high-growth sectors statewide. 
For over two decades, Maine has pursued a strategic vision to support innovation across the economy. 
There have been a number of important milestones and wins in that time and we are better off now than 
when we started. Unfortunately, Maine has not made the commitment to invest at a level commensurate 
with our lofty vision. As a result, we have not progressed as far as we want or as far as we need. Despite 
this, Maine is home to nationally and internationally recognized research centers making advancements in 
life sciences, biotech, renewable energy, advanced materials, forestry, agriculture, aquaculture, and marine 
sciences. These research centers need a strong State of Maine partner to send a clear message to the 
market that Maine is serious about R&D, that we support our R&D community, and that their investment 
will be valued. 
UNE is proud to be an important piece of Maine's R&D infrastructure with experts in life science, biotech, 
aquaculture, and marine science, to name a few. UNE is home to a number of research centers: 
1.Center of Biomedical Research Excellence for the Study of Pain and Sensory Functions (COBRE) 
2.Center for Excellence in Aging and Health 
3.Center for Excellence in Collaborative Education 
4.Center for Excellence in Digital Health 
5.Center for Excellence in Neurosciences 
6.Center for Excellence in Public Health 
7.Maine Concussion Management initiative 
8.Arthur P. Girard Marine Science Center and School of Marine and Environmental Programs 
9.The Center for North Atlantic Studies (UNE North) 
Our Office of Innovation supports students, faculty, and professional staff to transform their research and 
ideas into market solutions with commercial viability.
