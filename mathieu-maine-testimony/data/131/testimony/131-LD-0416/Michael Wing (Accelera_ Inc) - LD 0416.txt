To the Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs,
I would like to place my full endorsement for supporting the Maine Technology 
Institute (MTI). Accelera, Inc., a company that I co-founded in Maine has been a 
client of MTI from our beginning. Through grants and the strong support provided by 
MTI, we were able to design, develop, and test our product, which has led to 
commercialization. 
From a business perspective, MTI is one of Maines strongest assets for driving 
innovation in Maine and has had a significant impact on many companies and their 
employees. Please consider supporting MTI with LD 416. This is a sound investment 
in Maines economic future.
Sincerely,
Michael Wing, CEO
