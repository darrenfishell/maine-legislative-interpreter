LD 416 
An Act to A uthorize a General Fund Bond Issue for Research and Development an d Commercialization  
 
24 April 2023  
 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Appropriations  and Financial Affairs:  
 
My name i s Shawn Champagne. I am the Operations Manager for Compounding Solutions, LLC  locat ed in 
Lewiston , Maine. I am here to day to present te stimony on beha lf of Compounding Solutions  (“CS”) in 
support of LD  416. 
 
Compounding Solutions was founded  in 1999  by Scott Neal  who remain s the sole owner . Since 
inception, the focus of C ompounding Solutions has been to pro vide the m edical device i ndustry with 
custom thermoplastic compounds of the high est quality. Currently  out of  our Lewiston, M E facility,  CS 
supplies me dical grade compound s into 26 differe nt co untries. Against strong compe tition to supply into  
the rapidly advancing , technically driven , and quality focuse d medical device ma rketspace , 
Compounding Solutions well understand s the nee d for continual improvement  and investment  in R&D 
and self-growth .  
 
Below are details about C ompounding Solutions ’ devo tion to R&D and innovation , which i s very m uch 
in-line wi th the principles and intents of LD 41 6. 
 
▪ CS continual ly inves ts in the latest plastic s processing equipment  to maintain a technical  
advantage over our competit ion. Oftentimes, CS  custom fabricates our own highl y advanced  
pieces of equipment that are not available  elsewhere.   
▪ CS sets aggressive  departmental goals  to continually better our products,  facility,  employees, 
and team.  
▪ 30 out of the  100 total em ployees at CS work in the Quality and R&D Departments  alone. 33 
employees company wide have a degree from a college or un iversity.  This technical  backing is 
necessary for CS to be able to support our customer s’ technical needs and quality standard s.  
▪ CS supports our employees to further their  educatio n and expand th eir skillsets in areas such as 
Plastics E ngineering, plast ics process ing, elect rical , IT, analytical testing , leadership, etc.

▪ CS’s own IT team  has programmed a 100% custom ERP system  to facilitate our processes, 
provide company -wide visibility to order statuses, automate data collection , storage , and 
reporting , etc.  This innovative  ERP system will be an integral part of CS’s fu ture success . 
▪ CS’s Innov ation Department  assesses material  needs and commercial opportunit ies in the 
medical  device market space  to determine which material develop ments to work on.  CS takes 
pride in front -leading innovative material technolo gies that extend the design space for medical 
device manufacturers , impro ve device performance , and/ or provide enha nced patient  comfort , 
safety, or quality of life.   
 
Historically CS has always se lf-funded th e innovative efforts describe d above. Now in the modern d ay 
where R&D  world-wide  is fas ter, more competitive , and more e xpensive than eve r, CS is realizing 
financial supp ort m ay be necessary , or at minim um would  greatly assist, i n realizing  certain  business 
opportunities  and growing our position as a global leader in medical thermo plastic compounding.  
 
CS has recently applied for a grant through MTI to support our development of novel thermoplastic 
compounds that would offer lower coefficient of friction and anti -fouling performance to devices that 
would be used within the human body . With this financial support, CS could potentiall y arrive  at a better 
perform ing product  by allowing us to  affor d custom synthesis  of specific additive  chemistr ies to use 
within our compound s if we were to  run into performance limitations with commerciall y available 
additive s. Furthermore, funding assistance  would allow CS to generate a more comple te dataset to  
support the commercialization of ou r material technol ogies . Without sufficient evidence to support 
functional  performance, pr ocessabi lity, biocompatibility , regulatory compl iance, and risk mitigation , 
customers may not be willing to try a new ma terial technol ogy due to the  financia l risks , risks of 
underperformance  and time loss , or unknow n Regulatory chall enges.  
 
CS is proud to be a Maine based c ompany and avidly support s LD 416 for our own potential future 
benefit  and for the ben efit of other innovative companies throughout the state.  Maine has a skilled 
workforce capable  of competing  globally across many different industries. Access to support ive funding 
for innovative efforts is e ssential to help Maine companies succe ed and  to keep the tal ented workforce 
within the state.  In the recent few years , companies are trying to best manage  the higher  expenses in 
labor, raw materials, equipment, packaging, freight, and u tilities. Let ’s not let these  essent ial expenses  
inhibit a n active, motivated , and knowledgeable  company from being innovative if R&D funding can be 
the key to their success.  For th ese reasons , I urge you t o support LD 416 . Thank you for the opportunity 
to testify today.  
 
Sincerely ,  
Shawn Champagne
