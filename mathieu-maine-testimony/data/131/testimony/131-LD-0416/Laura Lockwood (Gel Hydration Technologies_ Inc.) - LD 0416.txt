RE: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue for Research and Development 
and Commercialization
Attn: Appropriations Committee
I am in support of the 100M grant as I am one of 2 partners in a small, minority 
owned business in Bangor, Maine. We are a biotech manufacturing company, creating
edible gel products to address hydration issues in animals. We plan to bring in 
revenue and jobs for the state of Maine for years to come. As a 2-time recipient of an 
MTI grant award, we rely on Maine-based grants to help grow our company. I hope 
that the committee will decide in favor of this legislation.
