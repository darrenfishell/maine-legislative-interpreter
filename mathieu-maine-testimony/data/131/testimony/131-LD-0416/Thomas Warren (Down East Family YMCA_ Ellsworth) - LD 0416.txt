As the interim CEO of the Down East Family YMCA, Ellsworth, I am providing testimony 
in support of LD416 SP 197, An Act To Authorize A General Fund Bond Issue For 
Research And Development And Commercialization.
A similar bond passed in 2017, and this investment was the catalyst for our successful 
partnership with The Jackson Laboratory, providing childcare services to over 100 working 
families and 150 children. This partnership is a unique example of the economic benefits of 
Research and Development investment in a community.
Our Board of Directors and staff leadership team strives to leverage our trusted position in 
the community to provide high quality services and programs in support of working parents 
and families.
The Down East Family YMCA is a powerful advocate for the health and well-being of the 
many communities we serve throughout the region, and we advocate in support of LD 416.
Respectively submitted,
Thomas G. Warren, Interim CEO
