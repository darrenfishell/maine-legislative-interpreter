Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation: . 
I am Senator Trey Stewart and I represent District 2, which includes many communities in 
Aroostook and Penobscot Counties. Today I present to you LD 1142, “An Act to Eliminate 
Motor Vehicle Registration Fees for'Volunteer Fireﬁghters and Volunteer Emergency Medical 
Services Providers. ” -'

This bill is -designedi to Whittle out some richly-deserved ﬁnancial relief to those who value the 
safety and well-being of their fellow citizens and community members enough to volunteer forA 
demanding duties on-their behalf. Whether they are sacriﬁcing family and leisure time, or, 
perhaps even -pay elsewhere, emergency service volunteers -have elected to forego other; 
proﬁtable uses of their time to careffor and respond to those in extremely vulnerable and »’ 
potentially life-threatening scenarios. While most of us do not hesitate to tip our caps and 
commend this group on their quality work and selﬂessness when the occasion calls for it, their 
efforts merit expressions of gratitude beyond the purely symbolic. 
I was avolunteer ﬁreﬁghter for ﬁve years in Presque Isle. Like many other legislators who have 
been on duty, the desire to serve is compelling. The losfs of registration fee revenue is a small 
price to pay when we can compensate our brave volunteers in this way for saving not only 
property but the lives of our family, friends and neighbors." 
Thank you for your time and consideration.‘
