Please do not revoke Net Energy Billing. Multiple studies have shown that the Net 
Energy Billing (NEB) program in Maine provides ratepayers with net benefits. Both 
the Daymark Study (2021) and the Synapse Study (2022, page 37) report benefits, 
including tangible economic benefits (such as grid upgrades and reduced supply 
costs) as well as environmental benefits. However, utilities are not accounting for 
program benefits in their rate design, and, even more, utilities show lost revenue (i.e. 
solar customers buying less power) as a cost. This is, quite simply, bad math.
