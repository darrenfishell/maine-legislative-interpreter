LD 1986
Dear Legislators and Members of the EUT Committee,
Community solar will not cost Mainers millions of dollars. The Office of the Public 
Advocate’s cost estimates are grossly exaggerated, as they are based on undisclosed 
utility math and do not account for real economic benefits.
We can improve Maine’s solar policies to ensure low-income ratepayers are not 
harmed. We can make thoughtful changes to ensure the Commercial & Industrial 
Tariff Program within Net Energy Billing provides net benefits to all ratepayers. We 
can fix concerns about regressive rates without retroactive changes.
We have the solutions at our fingertips. We can enact proactive policy solutions today
that have already been developed by a diverse stakeholder group to address these very
issues. We do not need to repeal the entire program. LD 1986 is a solution, a bill that 
enacts the work of the Distributed Generation Stakeholder working group. This bill 
helps Maine receive money from the Inflation Reduction Act and requires the 
accounting of benefits in all cost evaluations of the NEB program. 
We’re grateful to now have a tangible way to point to a solution and say: enact LD 
1986, and reject any and all repeal and or retroactive proposals.
Thank you,
Susy Kist
