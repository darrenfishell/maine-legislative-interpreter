Testimony in Support of LD 1986 
An Act Relating to Net Energy Billing and Distributed Solar 
and Energy Storage Systems 
Steven L. Weems, Board Member, Solar Energy Association of Maine 
President, ‘Dirigo Community Solar Group 
To the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology 
May 24, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and other distinguished 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology: 
my name is Steve Weems, Board Member of the Solar Energy Association of 
Maine (SEAM); also founder and President of Dirigo Community Solar Group 
(Dirigo CSG), a nonprofit association of 14 small, member-owned community solar 
farms. SEAM and Dirigo CSG are strongly in support of LD 1986. 'lt would 
transform the distributed solar generation program into one that has a highly 
positive benefit/cost ratio and eliminates any ratepayer cost shift from the 
distributed generation (DG) projects undertaken, when the provisions specified in 
the bill are implemented. This is an outcome that everyone should be able to 
embrace as fair and protective of Maine ratepayers. lt would accomplish this 
while honoring the commitments made by prior legislatures to existing, early 
solar adopters — Maine people, businesses, communities, schools, and others. 
Three essential points anchor our position. First and foremost, rigorous 
economic analysis performed for the DG Stakeholder Group shows that the 
Distributed Solar and Energy Storage Program specified in Section 1 of LD 1986 
would have a projected Benefit/Cost Ratio of 2.77. This is extraordinarily 
positive, reflecting the value of pairing energy storage with distributed

generation. Even without storage, the Benefit/Cost Ration would be a strong 
1.67. Also of great importance, this economic analysis shows this new DG 
program structure would eliminate any ratepayer subsidy and reduce electric 
rit_ei Please refer to the chart from the DG Stakeholder Group Final Report at 
Appendix A, page 5. 
Second, by direct reference to the DG Stakeholder Group Final Report, 
LD 1986 defines this new Distributed Solar and Energy Storage Program (the 
”Program") as projects between 1-5 MW in size. Projects in this range account 
for about 93% of the total pipeline of all DG projects, as reported by the utilities, 
as of November 2022. The new Program would be structured so that these 
projects would provide wholesale energy and other economic values to utilities at 
a competitively bid price, which would disqualify them as NEB projects. The 
remaining NEB projects (1 MW or smaller) would be a minor factor in the overall 
DG category. This means the transformative aspects of LD 1086 for projects in the 
1-5 MW range essentially resolve the issue of ratepayer cost shift. See Appendix B 
(Page 6) to see a chart of the total DG project pipeline, sorted by project size. 
Third, while the DG program (currently synonymous with the NEB program) 
needs to be reformed, it is not the primary driver of high utility bills. The utilities 
are emphasizing to their customers that high electric bills are caused by energy 
charges, not their delivery charges. This is where the net costs any of DG 
(including NEB) incentives are recorded. The specter of $220 million in ratepayer 
costs is a fiction. The proof is in the utility rate cases currently before the PUC. 
Cl\/IP is requesting an increase of about $5 per month (allocation for NEB costs) 
from the typical residential customer, spread over three years, which is about 
3.2% of the average current residential bill. See Appendix C (pages 7-8) for the 
math of this. The real crises are our continuing reliance on high-priced fossil fuels 
and the antiquated Maine grid. This said, DG needs to be turned into an asset for 
all ratepayers, which would be accomplished by enacting LD 1986, while honoring 
the commitments made by previous legislatures to encourage Maine customers 
to get started along the path to beneficial electrification.
2
There are some limited changes to LD 1986 we think the Committee could 
consider, which do not damper our enthusiasm for the bill. In Section 1, the 
reference to the DG Stakeholder Group Final Report means the Distributed Solar 
and Energy Storage Program is designed to apply to DG projects in the 1-5 MW 
range, with a maximum project size of 5 MW. It might be clarifying to state this 
explicitly in the bill. We also think it may be desirable to implement some 
projects that cannot be paired effectively with storage, for some reason, that 
would still be beneficial to undertake, assuming they meet the test of having 
more benefits than costs and do not negatively affect ratepayers. Giving the PUC 
more flexibility in this circumstance would seem beneficial. Perhaps a preference 
for projects with storage could be considered, allowing for some projects without 
storage, as long as all projects have more benefits than costs and depress electric 
rates. 
In Section 3, we suggest the list of potential net energy billing benefits to be 
considered under Subsection 3209-C, Net energy billing cost recovery, paragraph 
1. Definitions, section B should also include avoided environmental and RPS 
compliance costs. Also, since an NEB customer by definition pays for a certain 
share of a project's generation, the customer should continue to be entitled to 
use this amount of energy at no charge for the value of the energy, thereby 
leveling this value with the energy charge the customer pays to whichever entity 
is provides electricity to the customer for any load demand the customer may 
have in excess of the customer's share of his or her NEB project generation. 
With or without modification consistent with the foregoing suggestions, we 
think LD 1986 is the kind of positive breakthrough legislation, with appropriate 
transitions, to deserve strong bipartisan support. While it does not turn back the 
clock, which would be egregious, it addresses real issues in a practical and fair 
way. We urge its favorable consideration by the Committee.

Benefits and Costs of LD 1986 Distributed Solar and Energy Storage Program 
There are two basic, distinct types of economic analysis typically undertaken. 
Benefit-Cost Analysis. This is a comprehensive analysis that looks at all the 
benefits and costs of any distributed energy resource (DER), including utility 
system and societal (general population) benefits and costs. 
Rate Impact Analysis. The rate and customer bill analyses encompass only the 
benefits and costs of DER that affect the utility bills of ratepayers. 
The foregoing was taken from the work of the economic consultants 
Synapse Energy Economics (Synapse) and Sustainable Energy Advantage (SEA) 
included in the Final Report of the DG Stakeholder Group, dated January 6, 2023. 
This is the latest and most comprehensive analysis of the net benefits and costs, 
and ratepayer impact, of certain distributed energy resources. This methodology 
IS used to analyze all types of distributed generation (including NEB programs). 
This specific work was oriented toward the charge of the Governor's Energy 
Office and the DG Stakeholder Group to come up with a successor distributed 
generation (DG) program, so this analysis is directly relevant to Section 1 of 
LD 1986 regarding the Distributed Solar and Energy Storage Program. 
lt definitely is possible to quantify benefits, costs, and ratepayer impacts, 
despite the difficulty assigning a value to things like clean air and reduced 
climate change, especially when comparing the merits of future options. 
The DG Stakeholder Group effort resulted in a recommendation fora 
successor distributed generation program that benefits all Maine people, 
without or with energy storage, with Benefit/Cost Ratios ranging from 1.67 to 
2.77. This new program design also would benefit a_H electric ratepayers, by 
depressing electric rates somewhat. This is the Distributed Solar and Energy 
Storage Program contained in LD 1986. See the chart on the following page.

from Distributed Generation Successor Program in Maine, Economic Assessment 
Consistent with the figure above, the increase in costs to deploy storage are sufficiently outweighed by 
the increase in beneﬁts, demonstrated by the BCR's for the two options shown below.

The same pattern can be seen for long-term rate and bill impacts. The Hybrid + Storage Case results in 
greater rate reductions than the Hybrid case due to the increased capacity beneﬁts.

Actual Numbers Instead of Scary Numbers 
The Office of the Public Advocate (OPA) keeps talking about an NEB 
ratepayer impact of S220 million per year. This is a fiction. lt is a scary, 
hypothetical, worst-imaginable-case scenario. For a more accurate context, 
consider the actual rate case filed by Central Maine Power (CMP) with the Public 
Utilities Commission (PUC). ironically this is the same rate case the OPA is 
working to negotiate down! ln this rate case, CMP is seeking about a $50 million 
rate increase, spread over three year, allocated to NEB costs. This is significant, 
and is cause for distributed generation program reform, but it is not a crisis. 
According to CM P, the company is seeking a total rate increase of 
$94.9 million over 3 years, for _b_qth_ (i) investment in a stronger, smarter, more 
resilient grid (an ongoing CMP responsibility), ang (ii) to support Maine energy 
policy objectives (including NEB). Assuming half of this amount is allocated to 
each purpose, this means $ 47.5 million for distributed generation and other 
clean energy incentives (including NEB). The average CMP residential bill is 
S 153.84/month. Per CMP, this would result in an increase of S 4.90 (only 3.2% 
of the current total bill) over three years. if the energy part of the bill decreases 
even one cent it would wipe out the impact of this clean energy cost. 
Math Proof 
Typical residential customer energy usage: 550 kWh/month 
Standard Offer Energy Rate: S 0.176310/kWh 
Delivery Charge: $ 13.66 (fixed for first 50 kWh) + S 0.086420/kWh (variable 
charge for remaining kWh used) 
Current bill charge: $ 13.66 + 0.086420 X 500 kWh) + (S 0.176310 X 550 kWh)= 
S 153.84

and clean energy purposes.

$4.90 per month (the cumulative total over three years is 0.9 cents/kWh 
* Note this is one-half the total rate increase for both regular, routine on-going 
investment and clean energy purposes. 
This is an incomplete story because it does not include offsetting benefits and 
additional projects that may come on line. Nevertheless, it shows the limited 
impact of State energy policy initiatives in the current CMP rate filing. The impact 
of these policies on the typical residential customer is less than one cent per kWh. 
A decrease in the energy charge of one cent of more (considered probable), or 
any other charge category, would compensate for this negative impact in full.A 
copy of the CMP customer notice on which the foregoing analysis is based is
