LD

An

Relating
to
Net

and

Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Ener gy ,
Utilities,
and
T echnology
Committee.
My
name
is
Ruth
Poland,
and
I
am
a
Bar
Harbor
resident
and
a
public
high
school
science
teacher
who
is
deeply
concerned
about
climate
change
and
the
future
we
are
creating
for
our
young
people.
I
am
writing
in
support
of
LD
1986
An
Act
Relating
to
Net
Energy
Billing
and
Distributed
Solar
and
Energy
Storage
Systems.
The
T own
of
Bar
Harbor
has
a
Climate
Action
Plan
that
calls
for
reaching
a
net
zero
emissions
community
by
2030.
Our
plan
has
a
strong
focus
on
developing
locally
generated
renewable
ener gy .
The
school
where
I
teach,
Mount
Desert
Island
High
School,
also
has
a
written
commitment,
unanimously
voted
for
by
the
school
board,
to
reach
net
zero
emissions
by
2030.
LD
1986
would
support
Bar
Harbor
and
other
local
communities,
in
reaching
our
climate
goals
and
accessing
the
benefits
of
locally
generated
solar
projects.
LD
1986
will
support
local
solar
projects
by
fairly
compensating
net
ener gy
billing
projects
for
the
benefits
they
supply
the
grid.
This
legislation
is
consistent
with
the
recommendations
of
the
Distributed
Generation
Stakeholder
Group
and
will
resolve
the
existing
issues
with
net
ener gy
billing,
lowering
long-term
electricity
rates,
and
ensuring
that
ratepayers
accrue
the
benefits
of
net
ener gy
billing.
In
contrast,
LD
1347,
which
will
be
discussed
during
the
Committeeâ€™ s
working
session
on
Thursday ,
would
remove
components
of
net
ener gy
billing
that
make
solar
ownership
more
accessible
to
low
and
moderate-income
Mainers.
LD
1347
would
be
harmful
to
solar
ener gy
goals
of
Bar
Harbor
and
other
communities,
preventing
our
low
and
moderate-income
residents
from
accessing
solar
benefits.
In
closing,
I
ur ge
you
to
pass
LD
1986,
legislation
which
supports
the
solar
ef forts
of
Bar
Harbor
and
communities
throughout
Maine.
Thank
you
for
your
service
to
the
people
of
Maine.
Sincerely ,
Ruth
Poland
