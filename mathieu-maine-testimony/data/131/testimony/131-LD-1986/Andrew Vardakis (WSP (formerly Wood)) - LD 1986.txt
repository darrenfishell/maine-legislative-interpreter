Dear members of the Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications Committee:
We support Maineâ€™s net energy billing program because it provides critical electric 
bill savings while supporting the development of local, clean energy. 
Community solar is a powerful solution to provide access to solar energy for all 
Mainers. Some of us are homeowners with a roof or property that is not suitable for 
solar. Some of us rent the homes we live in or the spaces where we do business. Many
of our fellow customers cannot afford the large upfront capital investment to purchase
their own solar installations. But all of us think that homegrown, renewable energy is 
good for Maine, and all of us want to be able to realize cost savings from our solar 
investment, just as those that are privileged enough to own their own rooftop system 
are able to earn a return on their investment. Community solar has been a simple, 
affordable option for us, and we believe it should remain an option for our neighbors 
and fellow Mainers. 
We are also highly concerned with calls to change the net energy billing rates for 
existing projects and those about to become operational. We strongly urge the 
Legislature to avoid adopting any policies that would impact those savings and our 
ability to participate in the program. Further, we encourage the Legislature to take 
action to ensure community solar can continue to serve more customers, especially 
low-income and disadvantaged customers, well into the future. 
Please vote NO on LD 1347 and YES on LD 1986.
Sincerely, 
Andrew Vardakis
