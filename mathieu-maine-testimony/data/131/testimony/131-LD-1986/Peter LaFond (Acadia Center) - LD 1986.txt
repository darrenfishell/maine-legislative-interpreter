Dear Members of the Joint Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology: 
l am the Senior Policy Advocate and Maine Program Director for the Acadia Center, a Rockport, Maine based organization 
that advocates ln Maine and throughout New England to promote the use of renewables. Acadia Center strongly supports 
Senator Lawrence's LD 1986, which contemplates a reasoned transition from the existing NEB program, especially as 
contrasted with LD 1347. 
But please remember that NEB has been a successful vehicle for change for Mainers seeking to transition to renewable 
energy. In towns and cities all across Maine, Mainers have built solar projects of all sizes and they are achieving the primary 
goals of State energy policy - reducing carbon output and saving money on electricity bills. These Mainers should not be 
punished by now changing the rules in the middle of the game. They have relied on NEB to both build and employ solar 
power and they have budgeted for the future with NEB in mind. ln any event, please be fair to Mainers who use NEB and 
don't apply any retroactive changes to NEB. Mainers’ existing contracts and arrangements made pursuant to NEB must be 
honored, or personal and institutional budgets will be imperiled across Maine. 
Mainers know the pain of electricity bills right now. But NEB has not and could not have caused the present high electricity 
bills - gas prices have. We all feel a pressing concern over high electricity bills, but please don't penalize Maine people, 
businesses and municipalities who in good faith and at the encouragement of their government successfully employed NEB 
as a vehicle for a more sustainable future.
