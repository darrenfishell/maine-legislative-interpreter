Testimony in Support 
LD 1986: An Act Relating to Net Energy Billing and Distributed Solar 
and Energy Storage Systems 
Testimony: 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, and honorable members 
of the Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee. My name is Kevin 
Buck and l am a selectmen for the Town of Tremont and I support LD 
1986. 
Integrating renewable energy, and solar energy in particular, into our 
existing is a complicated and nuanced undertaking. It provides clean, 
sustainable, affordable energy for everyone with the added benefit of 
being generated locally and under local control. 
In the spirit of full disclosure, l have a net energy billing (NEB) account 
with Versant Power and I am an elected official in a town that benefits 
from a solar array built on a capped landfill. The town’s array provides 
clean, locally generated electricity for all of our municipal buildings 
and grade school and is saving the town’s and its taxpayers 
thousands of dollars monthly. The savings have only increased due to 
the astronomical rate increases associated with natural gas. 
Tremont’s array has direct benefits for all residents, whether they are 
NEB customers or not.
Current NEB policy does need updating. This bill is a sensible 
approach to protecting rate payers and promoting a sustainable 
future. lt urge your committee to pass this bill.
