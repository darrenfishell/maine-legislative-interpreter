I’m on the Board of York Ready for Climate Action in York, Maine, though today 
I’m testifying as an individual. 
Our new Energy Coach Program helps residents electrify their homes and get that 
power from a clean source – often that’s community solar.  We need Maine to make 
community solar more accessible, not less, so we would not support repealing net 
energy billing (NEB) as LD 1347 calls for.  We would support LD 1986 that enacts 
the work of the Distributed Generation Stakeholder working group, which would 
address concerns about the cost of community solar without retroactive changes, and 
would require considering the financial benefits in understanding cost. 
Maine is up to the challenge of making community solar simple, accessible, and 
affordable to all our residents.  We’d better be; a successful transition to clean energy 
and an updated grid, which are critical to meeting the goals of Maine Won’t Wait, is 
dependent on wide acceptance of clean energy sources by our residents.  It’s a 
message our Energy Coaches need to carry to the residents we assist.
Thank you for your hard work.
