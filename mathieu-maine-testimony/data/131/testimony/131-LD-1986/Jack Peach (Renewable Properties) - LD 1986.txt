Renewable Properties
LD 1986
Renewable Properties, a solar developer with operating projects in Maine, supports 
LD 1986 and the development of the Distributed Solar and Energy Storage program.
The program will enable the deployment of cost-effective distributed solar and energy
storage systems in the state. These projects provide numerous benefits and can enable 
significant reductions in the costs associated with energy and grid infrastructure. In 
addition, this program will be consistent with the recommendations provided by the 
Distributed Generation Stakeholder group. These recommendations are the product of
engagement from industry figures, technical experts, and public input. As such, the 
programâ€™s final design will be shaped by the input of a wide range of stakeholders.
This bill will make clean, cost-effective renewable energy available to Maine 
ratepayers and provide the opportunity for future customers to access savings on their 
energy bills through these projects.  Renewable Properties supports LD 1986.
