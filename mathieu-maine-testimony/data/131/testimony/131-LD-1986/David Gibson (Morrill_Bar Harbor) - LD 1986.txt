Support
LD
1986:
An
Act
Relating
to
Net

and

T estimony:
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Energy ,
Utilities,
and
T echnology
Committee.
My
name
is
David
Gibson;I
serve
as
the
Director
of
Energy
at
College
of
the
Atlantic
(but
am
testifying
on
my
own
behalf),
and
I
am
a
Certified
Energy
Manager .
Through
my
work
on
building
solutions
with
communities
on
Mount
Desert
Island
and
throughout
Maine,
I
have
cultivated
a
strong
background
in
community-driven
solutions
that
bring
local
economic
benefits
and
emission
reductions.
I
strongly
support
LD
1986,
An
Act
Relating
to
Net
Energy
Billing
and
Distributed
Solar
and
Energy
Storage
Systems.
This
bill
of fers
a
strategic
pathway
to
protect
ratepayers
and
accelerate
the
strategic
deployment
of
distributed
energy
resources
in
Maine.
The
Maine
Climate
Council
and
Maine
legislature
have
established
ambitious
clean
energy
goals
to
supply
80%
of
Maine’ s
electricity
usage
with
renewable
generation
by
2030
.
LD
1986
would
advance
these
goals
by
establishing
a
new
distributed
generation
program
for
solar
that
is
based
on
expert
recommendations
and
allows
Maine
to
leverage
federal
funds.
This
stands
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
OP A ’ s
amendment
in
LD
1347,
which
will
be
reviewed
by
this
Committee
during
a
working
session
tomorrow .
LD
1347
would
ef fectively
repeal
critical
aspects
of
net-energy
billing
in
the
name
of
distorted
figures
which
blame
net-energy
billing
instead
of
natural
gas
for
skyrocketing
electricity
prices.
This
repeal
would
make
solar
ownership
inaccessible
for
most
low
and
moderate-income
households,
leaving
Mainers
unable
to
access
the
significant
federal
funding
for
solar
allocated
by
the
Inflation
Reduction
Act.
In
ef fect,
it
will
prioritize
wealthy
individuals
and
entities
that
can
af ford
to
purchase
distributed
generation
projects
outright.
In
contrast,
this
bill,
LD
1986,
accounts
for
the
magnitude
of
cost-saving
and
grid
resilience
benefits
that
these
projects
of fer .
The
final
report
of
the
Distributed
Generation
Stakeholder
Group,
submitted
to
this
Committee
on
January
6,
shows
that
this
recommended
successor
program
has
a
significantly
higher
benefit
than
the
cost
for
all
utility
customers.
LD
1986
will
resolve
the
current
issues
with
Net
Energy
Billing
and
create
a
structure
that
fairly
compensates
distributed
energy
generation
for
the
services
it
provides
the
grid
while
benefiting
all
utility
customers
with
long-term
reduction
in
rates.
Specifically ,
LD
1986
takes
net
energy
billing
(NEB)
out
of
stranded
costs
and
requires
the
Public
Utilities
Commission
(PUC)
to
account
for
NEB
costs
and
benefits,
including
a
specific
set
of
avoided
transmission
and
distribution
costs
that
must
be
accounted
for .
The
PUC
would
be
required
to
calculate
and
allocate
NEB
costs
and
benefits
annually
based
on
actual
costs
and/or
avoided
costs
over
the
previous
year .
As
a
result,
the
proposed
program
will
provide
significant
net
benefits
to
all
utility
customers
and
provide
a
long-term
average
reduction
in
rates,
thereby
eliminating
any
cost
shifts
among
customers.
I
urge
you
to
pass
LD
1986
rather
than
LD
1347.
LD
1986
would
benefit
Maine
ratepayers,
allow
Maine
to
leverage
significant
federal
funds,
protect
the
viability
of
solar
ownership
for
low
and
moderate-income
households,
and
allow
Maine
to
continue
working
towards
its
renewable
energy
goals.
If
LD
1347
were
to
pass
instead,
members
of
our
low
and
moderate-income
communities
would
not
be
protected–
their
ability
to
access
the
benefits
of
solar
ownership
would
only
suf fer .
Maine
needs
LD
1986
to
provide
a
strategic
pathway
for
vulnerable
communities
to
benefit
from
distributed
energy
resources.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
dedication
to
the
people
of
Maine.
Sincerely ,
David
Gibson,
CEM
