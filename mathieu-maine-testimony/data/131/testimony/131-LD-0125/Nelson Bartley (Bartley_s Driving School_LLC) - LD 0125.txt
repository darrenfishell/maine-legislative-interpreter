LD 125
I am a licensed driving instructor, I've been a driving instructor since 1972. I own Bartley's 
Driving School,LLC with locations in Gray, Yarmouth High School, Greely  High School - 
Cumberland, Cheverus.
I oppose LD 125 because I believe if left to driving schools to give road tests for license there 
will be too much pressure on schools to pass students even though the student failed the test 
because the school will be identified as a school not to go to because you won't get your 
license on the first try , so schools that try to do the right thing will soon find a significant drop 
in business because the word will spread fast among the teenagers. Also this will make the 
roads more dangerous because people will be getting a license when they are not ready. Also
it will open up the door to  increase fraud in the license process. This is a very bad idea. 
Thank you for your time .
