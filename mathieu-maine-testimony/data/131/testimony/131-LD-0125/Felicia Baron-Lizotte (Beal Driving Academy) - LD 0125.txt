Beal Driving Academy
LD 125
Hello, my name is Felicia Baron-Lizotte. I have been a driving education instructor 
for 22 years in the state of Maine. I have worked on all sides, an employee, partner, 
owner. I am director of the driving school Beal Driving Academy; the main office is 
run out of Beal University in Bangor. We have locations in East Millinocket, 
Ellsworth, Skowhegan, Waterville. I am against LD 125. In driver education it is a cut
throat business. The schools that are fun and have the easiest driving instructors are 
what the kids choose. some schools even advertise no homework. If you have just 
anyone doing road test then the school that passes anyone is going to be the busiest 
school as word gets around quickly. In the best interest of the student please keep the 
road exams done by the state. As they have no interest of how many fails or pass. 
They truly judge on their driving skill. Thank you so much.
