District 110: Cumberland, Chebeague Island and Long IslandTestimony of Rep. Steve Moriarty 
In opposition of 
LD 125, An Act to Allow Driver Education Instructors to Administer Driver’s License 
Road Tests 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation
Good afternoon, Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Transportation 
Committee. My name is Steve Moriarty, and I represent Cumberland, Chebeauge Island and 
Long Island. I am speaking in opposition of LD 125, An Act to Allow Driver Education 
Instructors to Administer Driver’s License Road Tests. 
This proposal was brought to my attention by a constituent, and after reading the bill, I share 
many of his concerns. In my view, those who have provided driver education should not be 
permitted to test their students and to issue Class C noncommercial driver’s licenses. The testing 
should be done by neutral examiners who have not instructed the examinees, as is currently the 
case. This provides an extra level of skill evaluation which is necessary for public safety.
I am unable to present this testimony to you in person due to a conflict, but I urge you to 
consider the testimony of Mr. Robert Moore.
Thank you for your consideration.
