MAINE’S PROTECTION  AND ADVOCACY  AGENCY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES  
 
May 9, 2023  Senator Joseph Baldacci, Chair Representative Michele Meyer, Chair 
Committee on Health and Human Services 
Cross Office Building, Room 209 Augusta, Maine 04333   Re: LD 495 - An Act Regarding Investiga tions of Out-of-hom e Child Abuse and 
Neglect 
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Represen tative Meyer, and Members of the Committee on Health 
and Human Services:  My name is Atlee Reilly and I serve as the Legal Director of Disability Rights Maine, 
Maine’s Protection and Advocacy agency for pe ople with disabilities.   We are providing 
this testimony in op position to LD 495 - An Act Regarding Investigations of Out-of-Home 
Child Abuse and Neglect . While there are some aspects of the bill we support (including 
the explicit inclusion of transitional living cen ters and school personnel in the list of 
individuals/entities subject to inves tigation), we oppose it as written. 
 
1. LD 495 removes the current req uirement that investigations  of abuse of children in 
residential facilities be  initiated within three business days. 
 
LD 495 would repeal Title 22,  Chapter 1674: Investigation of Out of Home Abuse and 
Child Neglect.1  And while the testimony of DHHS frames  this as simply a relocation, “to

return these statutes to the Child and Family Servic es Protection Act”
2 which is Title 22, 
Chapter 10713, some important language wa s lost in the transition. 
 Current law provides that  reports alleging jeopardy to a child  in a residential care facility 
must result in an investigation beginning within 3 business days.  See: 22 M.R.S. §8354 
(2)(B)(“The investigation team’s investigation of a report that  alleges jeopardy to a child 
in a residential care facility must  be initiated within 3 business days of the date of receipt 
of the report. If the investigation team cannot  initiate its investigation within 3 business 
days, the investigation team  shall request a safety plan from the facility.”)  
 LD 495 eliminates this require ment and does not replace it w ith any other timeline. And, 
given the way this is drafted, it is not ev en clear that the general requirement to 
“promptly investigate” all abuse and negl ect cases under 22 MRS §4004(2) would apply.
4  
Because this timeline was clearly  meant to protect children liv ing in residential facilities 
from being subjected to additi onal abuse and neglect, and b ecause institutionalized youth 
have been historically vulnerabl e to abuse, we oppose the elim ination of this protection.  
 
2. LD 495 would eliminate current st atutory training requirements. 
 
LD 495 would eliminate existing training requ irements for the out of home investigation 
team. Current statute provides the following:

https://www.mainelegislature.org/le gis/statutes/22/title22ch1071sec0.html  
 
4 Section 2 of LD 495 proposes to change the statutory reference in the general provision 
requiring DHHS to “pro mptly investigate” all abuse and neglect cases.  See: LD 495, 
Section 2 (“22 MRSA §4004, sub-§2, ¶B, as co rrected by RR 2021, c. 2, Pt. A, §64, is 
amended to read: B. Promptly investigate all abuse and neglect cases and suspicious child 
deaths coming to its attention or, in th e case of out-of-home abuse and neglect 
investigations, the department shall act in ac cordance with chapter 1674 subchapter 18”). 
By removing the timeline for beginning investig ations of out of ho me abuse and neglect, 
and referring back to those provisions for a timeline that is no longer there, any timeline, 
even a general one of promptness, is effectively eliminated.

7.  Investigation team training.  The investigation team shall receive 
training in the following:  A. Child de velopment; B. Identification of abuse 
and neglect; C. Interview techni ques, including but not limited to 
techniques for intervie wing children who are nonverbal or have limited 
verbal ability; D. Licensing laws and rule s applicable to facilities or persons 
subject to this chapter; and E. Remedies available to prevent, correct or 
eliminate abuse and neglect in out -of-home settings. 22 MRS §8353(7). 
  
These are very basic and foundational requiremen ts that it is reasonable to expect will be 
part of the initial and ongoing training for an yone participation in the investigation of 
reports of out of home abuse and neglect i nvolving children. DHHS noted that although 
LD 495 would remove these statutory tr aining requirements for the out of home 
investigation team, “this team will still be required to engage in training, and that this 
change is intended to allow OCFS leadership flexibility in  tailoring trainings to the 
specific needs of the team and current and evolving factors that impact their work.”
5 But 
the training requirements outlined above are ve ry general and should not in any way limit 
the flexibility of OCFS in dete rmining specifically how they will be met.  If anything, 
statutory training requiremen ts should be strengthened. 
 
3. Additional background that may be helpful in considering LD 495. 
 
While we have not conducted a complete review  of the history, we do want to highlight 
the recent origins of the provisions of stat ute that LD 495 woul d repeal.  During the 
Second Regular Session in the 126th Maine Legislature, LD 1685 “Resolve, To 
Strengthen the Protection of Children from Abuse and Neglect” was enacted after the 
override of a veto by the th en Governor in April 2014.6 That enacted resolve required the 
establishment of a working group to make “recommendations to strengthen the authority 
of [DHHS] and the Department of Education to respond to situations in which child 
abuse or neglect is alleged and to prevent further abuse of children”.

Then, in the First Session of the 127
th Maine Legislature, LD 1432 “An Act to 
Consolidate the Investigation of Out-of-home Child Abuse and Neglect” was enacted, 
again after an override of a veto from the then Governor.7  This contains the language 
that LD 495 would move and, as discussed ab ove, in some cases el iminate. In testifying 
in support of the bill, DHHS then lauded the training requirements it now seeks to 
remove, writing:  
I would like to say something about th is highly specia lized Team. They 
interview children, the victims of a lleged abuse or neglect. The team’s 
training includes child development, the identification of abuse or neglect, 
and techniques for interviewing childre n who are nonverbal or have limited 
verbal ability. They are tr ained to work with law enforcement, advocates, 
doctors, nurses and other professionals.
8   
 
And in testimony supporting the bill, the Main e Chapter of the National Association of 
Social Workers highlighted th e timelines and training requi rements, both of which would 
be removed if LD 495 is enacted as written.9  We believe this rela tively recent history is 
important when you consider a proposal that  would eliminate the deadlines and training 
requirements in current law.  In addition, the most recent report of th e Maine Child Welfare Services Ombudsman, 
while not specifically addressing investiga tions of youth in out of home settings, 
recommended that training for child welfar e staff and supervisors be aligned with 
national best practice.
10  In light of this recommendati on, statutory training requirements 
should probably be enhanced across the board, not eliminated.

We oppose LD 495 as written because of th e elimination of the statutory training 
requirements and the elimination of the requir ement to begin investigations of abuse in 
children’s residential facilities within 3 business days.  Than k you for considering this 
testimony.
