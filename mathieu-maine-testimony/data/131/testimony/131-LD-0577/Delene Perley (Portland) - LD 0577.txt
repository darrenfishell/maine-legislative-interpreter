Delene Perley
Portland
LD 577
My name is Delene Perley, I live in Portland and am a Deputy Registrar. Voting is 
important to me and my friends. I support LD 577, An Act to Increase Availability of 
Election Information on Local Government Websites.
Last September-October through Vote 411 I helped supply information about the 
ballot in Portland. I looked forward to seeing the finished product – what my ballot 
would look like, who the candidates were and information about them, and what the 
issues were about, how they would be worded and the pros and cons. 
I was out of the state for three weeks in October and on my return expected to see a 
stack of papers around town waiting for me to pick up and peruse. I never saw 
anything. Many of my friends consider me as someone who can help them find such 
information and they were asking me for it. The Portland Press Herald finally 
published some needed information but that is always very close to the election. 
Thought and discussion between friends takes time to develop. I did go online and 
finally found a ballot sample, but it shouldn’t have been so difficult to do. 
Hopefully this bill will help us do better in the future. Thank you for your work.
