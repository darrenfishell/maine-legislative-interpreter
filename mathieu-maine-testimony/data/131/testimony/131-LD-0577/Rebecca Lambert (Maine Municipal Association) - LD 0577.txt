Neither For Nor Against  
 
LD 577 – An Act to Increase Availability of Election Information on Local Government Websites  
 
March 2 , 2023  
_________________________________________________________________________________  
Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, and members of the State and Local Government Committee, my name 
is Rebecca Lambert , and I am testifying today  neither for nor against LD 577 on beh alf of the  Maine 
Municipal Association’s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For clarity, the LPC 
provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal 
interest.   
 Any attempt to increase access to election information is encouraged and supported by local 
officials across Maine.  LD 577 , An Act to Increase Availability of Election Information on Local Government 
Websites , seeks to require  the Secretary of State’s (SOS) office to develop and  maintain a web page within 
its publicly accessible website that contains general information on state and local elections.  It further 
directs the SOS office to provide a link to a municipal or county’s publicly available website and provide a 
template to  said municipality or county, upon request, for a web page linked to the municipality.  
 While the intent seems simple enough, some of Maine’s smaller communities do not have a web 
page or even a publicly available email address to use to conduct business  or for public inquiries . Those 
communities lack the technical expertise or staff to keep a website updated with the information 
necessary to be useful. The LPC urges committee members to remove the language that requires  the SOS 
to provide links to municipal or county websites or to provide a template for municipalities to design and 
maintain their own website.  
 The task to develop and implement the SOS web  page with general state and local election 
information and link municipalities to that site , though well intended,  would requ ire additional staffing 
and, once established, would require periodic review and updatin g—a task that  could quickly get 
overwhelming with nearly 500 municipalities across  the state.  
The LPC share s these concern s with the Maine Town & City Clerks Associati on and support their 
suggestion to consider an amendment that would shift  the responsibility for the development and 
implementation of the web  page s to the Infor ME staff, who are already trained and focused on  the 
technology aspect the public webpages . 
It is for these reasons that the MMA LPC is neither for nor against this bill. Thank you for your 
time and  the consideration of our perspective on this issue.
