LD 577
Maine has 430 towns and 23 cities. Many of these municipalities are small. Many 
have limited resources to publicize information on state and local elections. As a 
volunteer for the League of Women Voters, I contacted many town clerks to 
encourage them to provide election information to their citizens, for the 2022 election.
Many replied that they appreciated my efforts. They felt that the League of Women 
Voters was doing an important service for their citizens. Providing election 
information was an effort they too were trying to do, though they did not always have 
the resources or the time.  
LD 577 will address this lack of resources by having the Secretary of State's office 
offer a way to post this local election information online for towns. This will ensure 
that the information is available to all Maine citizens, which will be especially useful 
for citizens of towns that today do not provide this information online. All Maine 
voters should have easy access to local election information before they vote.
Maine can be proud of our voter participation record. In 2022, 75% of registered 
voters voted. We may have the highest turnout in the nation. Support for LD 577 is 
support for all Maine voters. Thank you for your consideration
