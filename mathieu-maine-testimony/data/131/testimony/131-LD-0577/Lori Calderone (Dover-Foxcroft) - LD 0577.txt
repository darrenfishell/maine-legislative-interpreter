LD 577
I am a voter in Piscatiquis County writing in support of LD 577. As a volunteer for 
the League of Women Voters central Maine Highlands chapter, I have spent some 
time reaching out to small towns and municipalities in Piscatiquis County to learn 
about how they keep their community members informed about local governance and 
upcoming elections and referendum. While some larger municipalities have 
established websites and utilize other social media to communicate, many small 
entities have no digital information source, or struggle to keep what they do have 
updated. Their struggle is largely due to inadequate resources. As a result, their 
residents are more likely to be uniformed and disengaged, and less able to fully 
participant in their local community.
LD577 will help fill the gap. Nothing is more important than a community of 
informed voters. An enhancement of the state website, or slight expansion of the voter
look up tool will go a long way toward ensuring an informed, educated electorate 
across the state.
