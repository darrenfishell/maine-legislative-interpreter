 TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
 
Before the Joint Select Committee on Housing 
Hearing Date: Friday, May 19 
  
LD 1901 – “An Act to Improve Affordability and Opportunity for Maine Renters 
and Landlords” 
 
 
 Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and members of the Housing 
Committee – good morning, my name is Michael Allen, Associate Commissioner 
for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  I am 
providing testimony at the request of the Administration Neither For Nor Against 
LD 1901, “An Act to Improve Affordability and Opportunity for Maine Renters and 
Landlords.” 
This testimony is limited to the bill as it affects taxation and Maine Revenue 
Services.  For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, the bill proposes to 
expand the refundable property tax fairness credit (“PTFC”) by (1) increasing the 
maximum refund from $1,000 to $1,500 for resident individuals under 65 years of 
age and from $1,500 to $2,250 for resident individuals 65 years of age and older; 
and (2) by increasing the benefit base to $3,075 for single individuals; $3,975 for 
heads of households claiming one qualifying child or dependent and persons filing 
joint returns; and $4,875 for heads of households claiming more than one 
qualifying child or dependent and persons filing joint returns claiming at least one 
qualifying child or dependent.   
The bill also lowers the percentage of Real Estate Transfer Taxes (“RETT”) 
directed to the General Fund from 50% to 10%.  In addition to this bill, there are 
2 
 several other proposals, including the Governor’s Change Package to LD 258, that 
makes changes to the distribution of RETT revenues.  
The PTFC has been revised several times since it was enacted in 2013.  For 
tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the refundable PTFC may be 
claimed by Maine residents who owned or rented a home in Maine during any part 
of the tax year, lived in that home during the year as a primary residence, and paid 
property tax on the residence in Maine during the tax year in an amount greater 
than 4% (or paid rent greater than 26.67%) of their total income.  The PTFC is 
equal to the benefit base that is greater than 4% of the taxpayer’s total income, up 
to $1,000 ($1,500 if 65 years of age or older).  The benefit base for tax years 
beginning in 2023, as adjusted for inflation under 36 M.R.S. § 5403(6), is $2,300 
for single individuals; $3,000 for heads of households claiming one qualifying 
child or dependent and persons filing joint returns; and $3,700 for heads of 
households claiming more than one qualifying child or dependent and persons 
filing joint returns claiming at least one qualifying child or dependent.  For tax 
years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, the PTFC is doubled for veterans who 
are 100% permanently and totally disabled. 
The Administration notes that the bill should be amended to coordinate the 
increase in the benefit base amounts in Section 6 of the bill with the annual 
inflation adjustment in 36 M.R.S. § 5403(6).   
The estimated revenue impact of the bill is not currently available. 
The expansion of the credit will cause an increased risk for fraud, therefore 
requiring additional staff to review the eligibility of the credit.  The estimated 
administrative costs are $187,836 beginning in fiscal year 2025.  Two additional 
Tax Examiner positions are required, effective October 1, 2024, to process affected 
3 
 individual income tax returns and perform desk audits to review eligibility of the 
increased tax credit.   
The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.
