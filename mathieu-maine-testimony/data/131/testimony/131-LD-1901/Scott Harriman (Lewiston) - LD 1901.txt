Good
morning
Senat or
Pier ce,
Repr esentativ e
Ger e,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Housing.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman,
I’ m
a
landlor d
her e
in
Lewist on,
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
1901,
An
Act
t o
Impr o v e
Affor dability
and
Oppor tunity
for
Maine
Renters
and
Landlor ds. ”
Speaking
t o
other
landlor ds
and
pr oper ty
owners
ar ound
Lewist on,
I’v e
learned
of
so
many
former
r ental
units
that
ha v e
fallen
int o
disr epair
and
ar e
sitting
empty
as
well
as
many
empty
spaces,
especially
on
the
upper
ﬂoors
of
downt own
commer cial
buildings,
that
ha v e
ne v er
been
built
out
and
which
r epr esent
many
mor e
potential
apar tments.
Pr o viding
no-inter est
loans
can
giv e
pr oper ty
owners
a
head
star t
on
conv er ting
some
of
these
units
int o
habitable
homes.
T o
be
completely
honest,
$50,000
per
unit
is
pr obably
not
enough
t o
incentiviz e
new
construction,
but
it
can
go
a
long
wa y
t owar d
r eno v ation
of
existing
spaces
that
will
help
t o
addr ess
Maine ’ s
curr ent
housing
crisis.
Please

1901.
Thank
