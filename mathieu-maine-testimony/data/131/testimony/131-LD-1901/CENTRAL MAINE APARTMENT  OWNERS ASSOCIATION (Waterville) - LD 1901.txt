Testimony in SUPPORT to LD 1901: An Act to Improve Affordability and Opportunity for Maine 
Renters and Landlords 
 
 
To the Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
The Central Maine Apartment Owners Association (CMAOA) is a landlord membership organization of over 
650, as well as a cooperative team member of other landlord associations across the State of Maine including: 
Southern Maine, Lewiston Auburn, Greater Bangor Area, and Augusta Area.  We provide educational events, 
sponsor community events, provide access to discounts on supplies and industry needs like fuels, flooring 
materials and paint. Our overall goal is to support Landlords in providing safe and affordable housing in 
collaboration with the valuable good renters in our area.  CMAOA and the other organizations are neutral, 
nonpartisan, member led groups that have the common goal of keeping the rental housing industry safe, 
educated, and competitive.   
We are asking you to Support LD 1901 
This bill introduces a jumpstart to reinvestment in blighted buildings and new investment in affordable 
housing.  This is one way forward in addressing this housing crisis caused by LACK of housing. 
 
We urge you to Support LD 1901
