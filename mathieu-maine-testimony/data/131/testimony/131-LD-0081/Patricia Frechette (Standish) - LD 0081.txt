Dear Committee Members:
When will people take responsibility for their own actions?
Welfare, general assistance, whatever you want to call it, means someone else is 
paying for you.  I am all about helping someone, but enough is enough.  General 
assistance just means the town or city pays instead of the State.  Either way, someone 
else is paying for it.
I ask the you vote OUGHT NOT to PASS, Thank you.
