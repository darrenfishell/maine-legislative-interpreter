In Support of LD 81, An Act to Address Recovery Reszdence Partzczpatzon m the Munzczpal General 
Asszstance Program 
Hearlng Date May 5, 2023 
Senator Baldaccr, Representatrve Meyer and Members of the J o1nt Standrng Commlttee on Health and 
Human Servrces, my name 1s Anthony Pelotte, and I serve as Dlrector of the Ofﬁce for Famrly 
Independence 1n the Department of Health and Human Servrces I am here today to speak 1n support of 
LD 81, An Act to Address Recovery Resldence Partlclpatron 1n the Munlclpal General Asslstance 
Program We are grateful to Representatlve Mlchele Meyer for sponsorrng th1s Department b1ll to 
ensure lmplementatlon of the mtent of PL 2021, Ch 472 
LD 81 seeks to clarlfy statute to ensure that General Asslstance program rec1p1ents can access housmg 
and servrces 1n recovery resrdences even 1f the recovery resldence 1s managed and operated by 
someone other than the legal property owner 
PL 2021, Ch 472 ensured access to General Assrstance beneﬁts for housmg by prohlbltlng a munlclpal 
overseer of the General Asslstance program from denyrng an ellgrble appllcant rental asslstance for the 
sole reason that the appllcant resldes 1n a recovery resldence Th1s change was lntended to provlde 
housmg securlty for Marne 1nd1v1duals 1n recovery whlle also promotmg an envrronment and servlces 
conduclve to the1r recovery Journey 
Followrng rmplementatlon, we realrzed that there 1s a lack of clarlty 1n statute regardmg who 1s elrgrble 
to recerve rental payments on behalf of General Asslstance recrprents Some recovery resrdences are 
operated by an 1nd1v1dua1 person or agency other than the lawful property owner of the recovery 
resldence locatron Typlcally, only the property owner 1s ellgrble to recelve payments from munlclpal 
general asslstance admmlstrators Thrs conﬁlslon has caused delays 1n payment lssuance, threatenmg 
housmg securrty for el1g1ble General Assrstance reclplents 1n recovery and causlng unnecessary 
confuslon for recovery resrdence operatmg managers and property owners We recognlze thls was not 
the mtent of the bill, now law, and appreclate the opportumty to address th1s drscrepancy 
Th1s statutory change w1ll provrde a deﬁnltlon for the “operator ” of a recovery resrdence and sol1d1fy 
that the operator 1s ellglble to recerve payments through the General Assrstance program These 
changes w1ll rncrease housmg securrty for Marne 1nd1v1duals who are 1n recovery and W111 enforce PL 
2021, Ch 472 by provldlng clarlty for mun1c1pal1t1es Thls change w1ll not have a ﬁscal rmpact 
We hope you wrll support the passage of LD 81 Thank you for your trme and attentron, I would be 
happy to answer any questrons you may have
