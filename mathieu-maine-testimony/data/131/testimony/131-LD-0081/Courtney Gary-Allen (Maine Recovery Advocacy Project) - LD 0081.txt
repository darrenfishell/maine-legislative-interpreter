Dear
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer
and
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services;
My
name
is
Courtney
Gary-Allen.
I
am
the
Or ganizing
Director
of
the
Maine
Recovery
Advocacy
Project,
a
grassroots
bi-partisan
network
of
lawmakers,
or ganizers,
and
or ganizations
working
on
community
and
public
policy
based
solutions
to
substance
use
in
Maine.
I
am
writing
in
support
of
LD
81:
An
Act
to
Address
Recovery
Residence
Participation
in
the
Municipal
General
Assistance
Program.
This
bill
is
a
technical
fix
brought
forth
by
the
Department
after
your
committee
passed
a
bill
to
ensure
that
people
in
recovery
residences
would
have
access
to
general
assistance.
W e
appreciate
the
Department's
ef forts
to
clarify
the
intent
of
the
law
and
hope
that
you
will
vote
to
pass
LD
81.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
dedication
to
the
recovery ,
harm
reduction,
and
reentry
community
in
Maine.
Please
reach
out
if
you
have
any
questions.
Sincerely ,
C o u r t n e y
