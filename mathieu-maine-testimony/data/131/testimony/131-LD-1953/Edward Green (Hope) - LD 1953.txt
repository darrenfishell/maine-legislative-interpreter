RE: LD 1953, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of 
Maine to Establish a Parental Bill of Rights.
Good morning, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Members of the 
Judiciary Committee,  
Parental rights are natural and fundamental. They are vital to the nurture of children. 
They are essential to a healthy, thriving society. In todayâ€™s world, a high level of 
esteem for parental rights is rapidly diminishing. This is very troubling.
Please stand with families all across Maine and support L.D. 1953 to protect parental 
rights in the text of the Maine Constitution. Empowering and supporting families in 
their efforts to direct the upbringing and education of their children is the right thing 
to do.
  
This powerful amendment will acknowledge and protect parental rights in Maine for 
generations to come. Please endeavor to leave that legacy by your positive actions 
toward its passage.
Thank you for giving this important resolution your full consideration, time and 
attention.
Respectfully submitted,
Edward Green
