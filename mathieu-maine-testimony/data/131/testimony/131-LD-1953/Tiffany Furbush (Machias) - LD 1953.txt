LD 1953
My name is Tiffany Furbush and I live in Machias, Maine. I support LD 1953 and the 
effort to protect parental rights in the text of the Maine Constitution. Parents have 
been given children by God to love and protect, and should be permitted to do so as 
long as there is not abuse of that power. Deuteronomy 6:5-7 gives clear instruction for
parents: “You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your 
soul and with all your might. These words, which I am commanding you today, shall 
be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them 
when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down 
and when you rise up.” We have been given a great responsibility for our children and
must protect that responsibility instead of pass laws that undermine God’s design for 
the family.
