Under the pretext of a concern for “parents’ rights,” the bill creates a host of new burdens on teachers, students, and parents. I strongly urge you to reject this harmful bill.  American Atheists is a national civil rights organization that works to achieve religious equality for all Americans by protecting what Thomas Jefferson called the “wall of separation” between government and religion created by the First Amendment. We strive to create an environment where atheism and atheists are accepted as members of our nation’s communities and where casual bigotry against our community is seen as abhorrent and unacceptable. We promote understanding of atheists through education, outreach, and community-building and work to end the stigma associated with being an atheist in America. Religious liberty is an individual right guaranteed by the First Amendment, and American Atheists opposes efforts to misuse these constitutional protections to undermine the civil rights or religious freedom of others.  LD 1953 provides parents the ability to object to instructional materials instruction. For example, a parent might object to materials in biology class (if they have religious objections to evolution), history classes (if they disagree with the characterization of the US Civil War), geography (if they believe the Earth is flat), or even math (if they agree the language in the Bible that implies π is 3). This is no way to run a school – and it would be a nightmare for teachers and administrators.   This bill would also require parental notification to participate in school clubs. School organizations and clubs have long been recognized as a critical component of a healthy student environment. They allow students to engage in and learn about a variety of issues beyond those covered in the curriculum, encouraging them to build a broader array of friendships and interests. Congress recognized the importance of student activities when it passed the Equal Access Act in 1984 to require federally funded public schools to provide equal and unburdened access to

Although Maine lawmakers cannot repeal federal law, several of them clearly hope to get around it by making it more challenging to join ALL student groups, with the implicit understanding that this will hinder stigmatized groups (LGBTQ groups, secular groups, etc.) the most. LD 1953 would require parental notification for any extracurricular student group or activity. Requiring this level of parental notification just to participate in basic school activities is unnecessary. It places an additional burden on students seeking to participate in extracurricular activities, on teachers who would need to oversee this notification schema, and in school clubs themselves. This bill is designed to prevent participation in clubs and activities to students who would most benefit from them.   LD 1953 would particularly harm LGBTQ students because it would require schools to notify parents of students who participate in a gay-straight alliance club (GSAs) or similar LGBTQ-focused or inclusive clubs and require permission for such participation, if Maine schools approved them. GSAs and similar groups have long been a refuge for young people who are questioning and or exploring their gender and sexuality. These clubs are not only a safe space for LGBTQ students, but they are also proven to improve mental health and student wellbeing. For example, GSAs have been shown to decrease feelings of depression and despair, which subsequently helps reduce suicide ideation and attempts for students.2 Other research shows that GSAs can help mitigate the impact of school bullying and harassment of LGBTQ youth and lead to greater feelings of connectedness to the school community.3 Despite the many benefits of these groups, LD 1953 would effectively hinder any child with unsupportive parents, or who is not yet ready to have these conversations with their parents, from participating.   This bill further harms LGBTQ students by denying them a place of safety in Maine schools. Perhaps most distressingly, the bill endangers LGBTQ students by forcing teachers and counselors to disclose information that could potentially label students as LGBTQ, with no regard for whether this puts a student in harm’s way. Growing up is challenging enough, and schools must be a space of safe expression for students.   Equally problematic and cruel, LD 1953 would require school officials to notify parents of a student's gender expression or gender identity. Not only does this put the student at risk of harm if their parents are not supportive, but medical authorities have also long established that social  1 20 U.S.C. § 4071.  2 Deming, E., Soule, K., Poulsen, N., Walker, T.

Overall, LD 1953 is immensely harmful to trans students, posing both extensive physical and psychological risks. We urge you to remain mindful of your responsibilities to all students in Maine, regardless of their gender identity or expression.   LD 1953 would increase the number of vaccination exemptions which allow parents to exempt their children from vaccination requirements. Public health experts believe that no exception should be made to neutral immunization requirements intended to protect public health. Specifically, non-essential exemptions to immunization requirements endanger all in order to accommodate the religious or philosophical beliefs of a few. Such exemptions are unacceptable from both a public health and moral perspective. Successful population immunity to disease depends upon a significant level of vaccination, as high as 95% for some diseases.5 Because some people are unable to receive vaccination for medical reasons, it is therefore inappropriate and dangerous to allow for arbitrary compliance by the rest of the population.  Creating a loophole in Maine’s vaccination requirements will put all at risk, more specifically children. Children are at significant risk for contracting debilitating and potentially deadly infectious diseases. Children exempt from immunization requirements are more than 35 times more likely to contract measles6 and nearly 6 times more likely to contract pertussis (whooping cough),7 compared to immunized children. According to the CDC, the opt-out rate for vaccination in Maine is 5.3%, which is more than double the national average of 2.2%.8 Tragically, this difference is responsible for a public health epidemic: Maine has one of the highest rates of pertussis in the country and skyrocketing rates of chickenpox.9  History illustrates that outbreaks often occur in communities that are unsupportive of vaccination. For example, measles is a vaccine-preventable disease that has plagued multiple  4 Jack L. Turban, Dana King, Jason J. Li, Alex S.

No person should be subject to harm or illness based on the religious beliefs of their classmates’ parents.   Finally, although this bill is framed about protecting parents’ rights, the only rights protected are those of a narrow fringe worried that are paranoid about what clubs their children have joined or what names they go by. And in order to protect these absurd “rights,” this bill would sacrifice the health and safety of other students. Maine’s public schools are meant to be safe and welcoming for all students. Lawmakers should not manufacture “parent’s rights” that endanger students or strip away their civil rights. We strongly urge you to reject this unnecessary and harmful bill.
