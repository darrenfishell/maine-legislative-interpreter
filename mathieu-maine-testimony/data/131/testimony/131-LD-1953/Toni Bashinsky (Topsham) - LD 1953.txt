Toni Bashinsky
Topsham
LD 1953
Good Morning Esteemed Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Toni Bashinsky and I am from Topsham, Maine. I am submitting 
testimony today in support of LD 1953. 
It is imperative that parental rights in Maine are protected and preserved for current 
and future generations by solidifying this within our Maine State Constitution. Maine 
would be the first state to pass such a law and that would be groundbreaking. 
Revolutionary, really! Put Maine on the forefront of this type of protection and please 
vote Ought to Pass. 
Thank you,
Toni Bashinsky
