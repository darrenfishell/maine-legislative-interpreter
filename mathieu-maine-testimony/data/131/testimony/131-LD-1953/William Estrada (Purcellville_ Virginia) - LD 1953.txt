Written Testimony by William A. Estrada, Esq.  
President, ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation  
Regarding   
L.D. 1953 , Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish a Parental 
Bill of Rights  
May 23, 2023  
Thank you for this opportunity to submit written testimony about L.D. 1953, Proposing an 
Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Estab lish a Parental Bill of Rights . 
L.D. 1953  is premised on 100 years of U.S. Supreme Cour t precedent . While 16 states have 
already passed laws similar to L.D. 1953  to codify parental rights as fundamental in state code, 
L.D. 1953  – if adopted as a n amendment to the Maine Constitution – would make Maine the first 
state to enshrine parental rights in a state Constitution.  
L.D. 1953  establishes that parents are a child’s first, best, and strongest protection , and that the 
best way to protect children  is by empowering parents.  
L.D. 1953  establishes  that parental rights are a fundamental right, the highest right recognized in 
our nation’s legal structure.  
The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized that parental rights are a fundamental right. See, 
e.g., Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 (1923), Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 (1925), 
Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 (1972), and Troxel v. Granville , 530 U.S. 57 (2000).  
The 1 6 states that have protected parental rights in state code using languag e similar to this 
proposed amendment are West Virginia prior to 1931, Kansas and Michigan in 1996, Texas in 
1999, Utah in 2000, Colorado  in 2003, Arizona in 2010, Nevada and Virginia in 2013, Oklahoma 
 
 
 
 in 2014, Idaho in 2015, Wyoming in 2017, Florida and Mo ntana in 2021, Georgia last year, and 
passage of S.F. 496 in Iowa, where it awaits Governor Kim Reynolds signature into law.1  
In the se 16 states that specify in state code that parental rights are fundamental, abuse of children 
and neglect of children are  still prosecuted. Parental rights are still terminated when the 
government shows that it has a compelling state interest to do so and the re is no less restrictive 
means to protect the best interests of the child.  
In the se 16 states that specify in state code that parental rights are fundamental, parents are not 
allowed to disrupt teachers during the school day. The public schools are still  strong.  
And in the se 16 states that specify in state code that parental rights are a fundamental right, laws 
governing the education of children at home, compulsory attendance laws, and other common -
sense laws governing the parent -child relationship exis t as they did prior to the passage of the 
fundamental parental rights legislation.  
If L.D. 1953  is adopted as an amendment to the Maine Constitution , it will provide parents with 
the highest level of legal protection . It will enshr ine in Maine ’s Constitution that parents have the 
fundamental right to educate their children, care for their children, and raise their children , while 
still allowing the Maine  state government to protect children when necessary, and to still provi de 
public education. The Legislature is charged with protecting the rights of the people, and this 
proposed amendment to the Maine Constitution would make Maine  the nation’s leader in 
protecting parental rights.  
So, what is a fundamental right? Let’s start 100 years ago, with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1923 
decision in Meyer v. Nebraska.  The U.S. Supreme Court stated “[T]he individual has certain 
fundamental rights wh ich must be respected.” And then speaking about the U.S. Constitution’s 
14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause, the U.S. Supreme Court continued “Without doubt, it 
denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contra ct, 
to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, 
establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own 
conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized a t common law as essential 
to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.”

see also W. Va. Code § 49 -1-1(a) and W. Va. Code § 49 -6D-2(a)); Kansas (Kan. Stat. Ann. § 38 -141(2)(b); see also 
Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60 -5305(a)(1)); Michigan (Mich. Comp. Laws § 380.10); Texas (Texas Family Code § 151.003);  
Utah (Utah Code Ann. § 62A -4a-201; see als o Utah Code Ann. § 30 -5a-103); Colorado (Colo. Rev. Stat. § 13 -22-
107(1)(a)(III)); Arizona (Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 1 -601); Nevada (Nevada Rev. Stat. Ann. § 126.036); Virginia (Va. Code 
Ann. § 1 -240.1); Oklahoma (Okla. Stat. tit. 25, § 2001 —2005); Idaho (Idaho Code § 32 -1012 – 1013); Wyoming 
(Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 14 -2-206); Florida (Fla. Stat. § 1014.03); Montana (Mont. Code Ann. § 40 -6-701); Georgia (Ga. 
Code Ann. § 20 -2-786).  
 
 
 
 
 Two years later, in 1925, the U.S. Supreme Court made this even more clear in Pierce v. Society 
of Sisters: “The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this U nion repose 
excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept 
instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who 
nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, c oupled with the high duty, to recognize and 
prepare him for additional obligations.”  
In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Wisconsin v. Yoder : “[T]his case involves the 
fundamental interest of parents, as contrasted with that of the State, to guide the r eligious future 
and education of their children. The history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong 
tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children. This primary role of 
the parents in the upbringing of their ch ildren is now established beyond debate as an enduring 
American tradition.”  
In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Troxel v. Granville : “The liberty interest at issue in this 
case -- the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their child ren -- is perhaps the 
oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” The U.S. Supreme Court 
then spent several paragraphs discussing all the cases establishing parental rights as a 
fundamental right, and concluded , “In light of this  extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted 
that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of 
parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.”  
L.D. 1953  will protect  the funda mental  rights guaranteed by the U.S. Federal Constitution in the 
Maine  State Constitution  for all parents in Maine , rich and poor, Black and white, urban and 
rural, Republican and Democrat.
