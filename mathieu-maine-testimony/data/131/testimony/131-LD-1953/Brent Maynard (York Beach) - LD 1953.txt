LD 1953
To Members of the Judiciary Committee:
     I have read LD 1953 and would strongly urge its passage.  Parents have the right to
monitor what there children are exposed to and public schools and to protect them 
against anything that could harm them spiritually, psychologically or emotioinally.
     Respectfully,
     Brent A. Maynard
