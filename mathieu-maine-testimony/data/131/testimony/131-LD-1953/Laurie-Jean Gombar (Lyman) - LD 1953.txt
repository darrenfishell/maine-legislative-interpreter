LD 1953
Senator Anne Carney, Representative Matt Moonen and distinguished members of the
committee, I am testifying in support of L.D.1953.  Parents know their children best 
and what they need. Please stand with families in Maine and support L.D. 1953 to 
protect parental rights in the text of the Maine Constitution. This powerful 
amendment will protect parental rights in Maine for generations to come.
