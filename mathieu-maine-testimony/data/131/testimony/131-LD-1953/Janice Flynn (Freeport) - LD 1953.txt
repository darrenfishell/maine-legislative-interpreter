LD 1953
I would like to express my support of LD 1953. I am disappointed that we have come 
to a place in this state and country where we have to steadfastly protect parental rights
from anyone. I appreciate and thank the people that drafted and sponsored this 
resolution. I urge all to put themselves in the shoes of a parent who is purposefully 
being shut out of the decision making process of their child's life. That is scary, heart 
wrenching, and wrong. The last time I looked, we live in America, not China. Please 
stand with parents and allow us to raise our children. Please support this Resolution.
