Avonlea Dwight
Kennebunkport
LD 1953
Dear Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Avonlea Dwight, a resident of Kennebunkport, Maine testifying in 
support of LD 1953. 
The very fact that LD 1953 is on the table should sound the alarm to legislators that 
there is a sickness within the Maine school system, government agencies, and 
healthcare that is causing parents to act to defend their rights as parents and the safety 
of their children. Parents put their trust in schools and government agencies and when 
that trust is broken - action ensues. This alone should be ample notice that children 
are in danger. 
To oppose this resolution is to claim that parents of this state do not know what is in 
the best interest of their children - which is to upend the point of democracy and 
government at its roots - that government is beholden to its citizens. Reaching a point 
where parental rights must be solidified in constitution is a red flag that government 
agencies have overstepped too far, and that the people are coming back to reclaim 
their rights. To oppose this resolution is to claim that government agencies are the 
best intentioned when it comes to raising the next generation. Even a sniff of the state 
of government today makes it clear that these agencies would indeed make one sick 
parent, hence one sick community and generation. And who would this sickness 
serve?  
So rather than continuing to be in denial that there being a serious problem, resulting 
in LD 1953 coming before you, I urge you to vote that this resolution "OUGHT TO 
PASS"
