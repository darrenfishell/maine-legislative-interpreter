LD 1953 - Ought To Pass
Amending the Constitution of Maine to Establish a Parental Bill of Rights has become
necessary to document rights that most parents historically have rightly assumed are 
theirs.  The growing bias of governmental entities to insert themselves between a 
minor child and a parent, without notice to the parent, warrants the addition of this 
amendment to the Maine Constitution.
