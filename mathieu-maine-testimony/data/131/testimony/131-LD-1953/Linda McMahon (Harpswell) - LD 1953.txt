LD 1953
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
My name is Linda McMahon, and I am from Harpswell.
I am writing in support of LD 1953. 
“RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish 
a Parental Bill of Rights”
Children are not the property of teachers, schools, school departments and 
governments. These entities are not co-parents. Their roles are to assist and support 
parents. It is a parents’ responsibility to ask questions and seek advice to determine 
the best course when raising their child. Making these decisions requires transparency
in the communication of information. Enlisting a child to keep secrets from parents is 
not in the best interest of the child and gives the appearance of impropriety. This is a 
tactic commonly used by people with perverse intent. It is a shame that today we need
government legislation to confirm parental rights, but here we are. It is the purpose of 
the government to protect citizens’ rights, not to overreach and usurp them.
I ask that you vote “ought to pass” so the voters of Maine can voice their intent.
Thank you for your service.
Respectfully,
Linda McMahon
