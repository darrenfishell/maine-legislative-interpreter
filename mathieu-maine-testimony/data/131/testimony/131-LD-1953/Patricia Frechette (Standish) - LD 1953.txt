Dear Committee Members:
This resolution proposes to amend the Constitution of Maine to provide that the State,
any of its political subdivisions, including, but not limited to, a school board, school 
district or school administrative unit, or any other governmental entity may not 
infringe on the  fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing and education 
of that parent's minor child without demonstrating that such action is reasonable and 
necessary to achieve a  compelling state interest and that each action is narrowly 
tailored and cannot be achieved by less restrictive means. It describes parental rights 
that are reserved to the parent of a  minor child without obstruction or interference 
from the State, any of its political subdivisions, including, but not limited to, a school 
board, school district or school  administrative unit, or any other governmental entity. 
It requires a school board, school district or school administrative unit, in consultation
with parents, teachers and administrators, to develop and publicly adopt a policy to 
promote parental involvement in the public school system. A parent claiming a 
violation of these provisions may bring an 47 action for declaratory relief, injunctive 
relief and money damages against the State, any of its political subdivisions, 
including, but not limited to, any school board, school district or 49 school 
administrative unit, or any other governmental entity that the parent claims has  
violated these provisions
THE STATE AND THE SCHOOLS DO NOT NOW OR HAVE EVER OWNED 
OUR CHILDREN.
PARENTS HAVE THE SOLE RIGHTS TO THEIR CHILDREN.
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF OUR CHILDREN!!
Please vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS,  thank you.
