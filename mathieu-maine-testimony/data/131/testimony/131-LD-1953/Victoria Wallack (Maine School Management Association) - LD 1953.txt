TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO
L.D. 1953
RESOLUTION, PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF MAINE
TO ESTABLISH A PARENTAL BILL OF RIGHTS
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Committee on Judiciary. I am Victoria Wallack,
director of communications and government relations for Maine School Management Association, testifying
on behalf of the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School
Superintendents Association, in opposition to L.D. 1953.
MSSA and MSBA support parental rights in education and have policies, handbooks, procedures and
guidance on parental involvement and engagement.
Sample board policies, which are attached to this testimony, make it clear that board members should promote
parent involvement and engage in the education of their children by monitoring their child’s learning
progress; reviewing homework; discussing concerns with the appropriate staff member in the school; and
joining the PTO or volunteering at school or school-related activities.
Federal law also protects parental rights under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Under
that statute parents have the right to know the level of their child’s achievement in schools; the professional
qualifications of their teachers; and the right to request that information about a student not be disclosed
without written consent.
Schools recognize and encourage parents to exercise their rights to partner with schools in the education of
their children. The Maine School Superintendents Association and the Maine School Boards Association are
not in favor of adding this proposed amendment to the Constitution of Maine and urge the members of the
Judiciary Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass on L.D. 1953.
