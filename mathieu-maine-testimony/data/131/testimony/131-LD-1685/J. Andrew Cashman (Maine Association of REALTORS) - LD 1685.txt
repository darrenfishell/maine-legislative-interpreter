Testimony in Opposition to LD 1685 
(“An Act to Increase Acreage Eligibility and Change Requirements for Filing Plans Under the 
Maine Tree Growth Tax Law ”)  
J. Andrew Cashman on behalf of the Maine Association of REALTORS®  
May 11, 2023  
Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation , 
my name is Andy Cashman. I am the Founder of Resolve Government Relations, and we represent 
the Maine Association of REALTORS®, a professional trade association  established in 1936 with 
over 6,500 members statewide. REALTORS® grow Maine’s economy and build Maine communities. 
Our members represent buyers and sellers involved in both residential and commercial real estate 
transactions. Our membership also includes industry affiliates, such as lenders, closing agents, title 
agents, appraisers, building inspectors, surveyors, etc. The Maine Association is chartered by the 
National Association of REALTORS® (NAR), the largest trade association in the country.  
The Maine  Association of REALTORS® opposes LD 1685. The bill  would impose additional filing 
requirements and make it more difficult for property owners to qualify for the Maine Tree Grow th 
Tax Law by increasing the eligibility limit from 10 to 25 acres . We oppose changes that will 
decrease  accessibility of the tree growth program , resulting in higher  taxes  for property owners .  
For these reasons, we urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 1685 . Thank you for your time and 
consideration.
