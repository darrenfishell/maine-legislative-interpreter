Eric Venturini, Executive Director  of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine  
Testifying in Opposition  
LD 1685, An Act to Increase Acreage Eligibility and Change Requirements for Filing Plans Under the  
Maine Tree Growth Tax Law  
Senator Grohoski , Representative  Perry , and esteemed members of the Committee on  Taxation , my 
name is Eric Venturini and I am the Executive Director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine .  
The Wild Blueberry Commission works on behalf of Maine’s 4851 wild blueberry farmers and businesses  
who grow our iconic wild blueberries on approximately 39,4002 acres across the state  and on 
Pass amaquoddy tribal land. In 2022, Maine produced 7 7.6 million pounds of wild blueberries 
representing nearly 100% of all wild  blueberries  and 9.6% of all blueberries  grown in the US. Our 
industry contributes an estimated 250 million dollars to the state’s  economy each year and t hat 
contribution brings vital  economic activity to Maine’s most impoverished count y, Washingto n County.3 
Thirty -eight percent of Maine ’s wild blueberry farmers are  2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation farmers.  Another 
8% of Maine wild blueberry producers have been farming for 5 or more generations.4 As family  farmers, 
they are landowners and more often than not own f orest land that is adjacent to their f ields. Many of 
these families obtain income from t heir forestland . They  have invested their time and money to have a 
forester come out , walk the property, make management recommendations,  and prepare a forest 
management plan. They have taken the time to work with state a nd/or municipal  authorities to regis ter 
that land as tree growth, and yes, they receive  a tax benefit to manage that land in accordance with 
their regularly updated forestry management plans.  
The major concern I have with this bill, is the provision that would change the minimum acreage  
requirement from 10 to 25 acres. If passed into law, this bill would change the assessment and taxation 
on land owned by hundreds of Maine ’s wild blueberry farmers. Of those farmers, it is the smallest that 
currently have less th an 25 acres enrolled in the program , and the smallest who therefore, would be the 
most affected.  
I ask that you do not  impose additional costs on Maine ’s small wild blueberry farmers and urge you to 
vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 1685.
