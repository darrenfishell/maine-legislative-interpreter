Public Utilities Commission for Intervenor Funding. 
 
Committee on Energy, Ut ilities and Technology 
By Pete LaFond, Acadia Center 
March 2, 2023 
 
Senator Lawrence, Representa tive Zeigler, and members of the Ener gy, Utilities and Technology Committee: 
My name is Pete LaFond, Senior Advocate and Maine Program Director at Acadia Center. I’m here to testify in strong 
support of LD 395, An Act to Expand Funding Sources Within the Pu blic Utilities Commission for Intervenor Funding . 
By providing financial support to groups and representat ives who may not otherwise be able to participate in 
regulatory proceedings, intervenor funding enables more Mainers to have a voice in decision-making at the Public 
Utilities Commission. Enhanced participation results in bette r decisions, improving services  for all utility customers.  
By allowing administrative penalties to be used to pay for intervenor funding, this bi ll would expand the possible 
sources of intervenor funding. Acadia Center strongly s upports this bill and urges the Committee to adopt it.   
 
Thank you.
