Maine Indoor Air Quality Council Testimony in Support of 
LD 954: An Act to Improve Indoor Air Quality in Child Care Facilities 
The Maine indoor Air Quality Council (”MiAQC" or the ”Council”) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated 
to creating healthy, productive and environmentally sustainable indoor environments in Maine. Our efforts focus 
on the development of education, communications, and advocacy for safe and healthy indoor environments 
where Maine citizens live, work, play and learn. 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health& 
Human Services: 
The Maine indoor Air Quality Council supports LD 954 because: 
0 There are many pollutants found in indoor environments that negatively impact human health. 
0 Young children are more likely to get sick from exposure to indoor air pollution: they have higher respiratory 
rates and immature bodies and nervous systems. 
0 A study conducted by the U.S. EPA in 2001 indicates that Americans spend 87% of their time indoors. 
Young children therefore are exposed to higher ”doses" of pollutants for long periods of time. 
We can help. 
The l\/laine indoor Air Quality Council is a membership organization comprised of professionals with extensive 
experience in improving indoor air quality in all types of buildings: homes, schools, workplaces, industry. Should 
this bill be enacted into law, the l\/laine Indoor Air Quality Council offers its assistance to the Department of 
Health and Human Services to provide public information about indoor air quality challenges in Maine and how 
to overcome them (much of this work MIAQC has already done). We further offer to assist the Department in 
the development of the grant process to ensure the greatest programmatic success and improvement in IAQ in 
child care facilities. 
A copy of the Council's Policy Statement on Indoor Air Quality is attached at the end of this testimony. 
The Maine indoor Air Quality Council is willing to answer any questions or provide additional information to 
assist you at the work session. 
Respectfully submitted by: 
Christine G. Crocker, Executive Director

Our society has become increasingly aware of the adverse health and economic costs associated with poor 
indoor air quality. Levels of indoor pollutants (including radon, lead, asbestos, carbon monoxide, tobacco 
smoke, volatile organic compounds, biologicals, and air toxics and other contaminants) are often 2-5 times 
higher—and may be 100 times higher—than outdoor levels. Studies have identified a broad range of adverse 
health effects and symptoms, from headaches, fatigue, nausea, aggravation of asthma and allergies, 
transmission of infectious respiratory diseases, to life threatening poisonings. indoor pollutants are of particular 
concern because most Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors. 
The principles for achieving a healthy and productive indoor environment are simple. The goal is an environment 
that is: 
v Clean 
o Dry 
0 Pollutant and Pest Free 
v Comfortable 
While the methods to achieve these goals may vary, the primary best practice tools are: 
0 Prevention or Elimination of Pollutants (source control) 
- Proper Ventilation 
~ Thermal and Humidity Control 
~ Proper operation and maintenance of the structure by the building owner 
0 Proper use of the structure by the building occupants 
Adherence to these basic principles will significantly reduce the risk of adverse health effects from indoor 
pollutants. Building owners, operators and occupants should educate themselves on and must work together to 
implement the basic principles and available best practice guidance.
