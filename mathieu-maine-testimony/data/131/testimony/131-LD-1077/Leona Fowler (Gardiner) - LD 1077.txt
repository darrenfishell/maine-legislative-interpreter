Testimony in Support of LD 1077, "An Act to Fund Consultation Services to Ensure 
Affordable Health Care for Maine Residents"
April 4, 2023
I support this bill because I directly benefited from Maine’s Health Insurance 
Consumer Assistance Program.
I called Maine’s Health Insurance Consumer Assistance Program HelpLine on Nov. 1
to get help enrolling in a health care plan for 2023 through CoverME.gov. I spoke 
with a HelpLine staff member who was very friendly and not in a hurry. She was 
conscientious and made sure she got all of my information correctly. I’ve been on a 
CoverMe.gov plan for the last two years and I like to get things done early. I’m so 
grateful for the CAP HelpLine’s assistance in applying. I am 80 and it’s nice to have 
some help sometimes. The HelpLine staff member took a lot of time with me and was
so patient and kind. She’s the kind of person you wish was your neighbor next door. I 
hope she remembers me for next year.
