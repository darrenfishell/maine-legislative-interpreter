CAP Funding Testimony
Testimony in Support of LD 1077, "An Act to Fund Consultation Services to Ensure 
Affordable Health Care for Maine Residents"
April 4, 2023
I support this bill because I directly benefited from Maine’s Health Insurance 
Consumer Assistance Program, which helped me get affordable health insurance 
coverage.
I contacted the CAP HelpLine in August because I was struggling with finding 
reliable insurance. I'm an international student and there are not really a whole lot of 
options for us. One of my advisors at school connected me with the CAP HelpLine. 
The CAP HelpLine staff member with whom I spoke gave me a high level 
understanding of what the different insurance terms meant. She helped me apply for 
coverage on CoverME.gov and my application was sent to MaineCare. I wasn’t 
offered any financial assistance on the Marketplace and my premiums and 
out-of-pocket costs were unaffordable. The CAP HelpLine staff member advocated 
for me and spoke with the two representatives at CoverME.gov, requesting lower 
premiums and out-of-pocket costs since I didn’t have income. 
Then maybe about a month or two afterwards, I received an email from the CAP 
HelpLine saying that there was, in fact, an error with CoverME’s determination and 
that I did qualify for an affordable health insurance plan. CoverME provided 
retroactive coverage to make up for the previous two months. The CAP Helpline staff 
assisted me with that and made sure that I got a plan that suited my needs. 
My Marketplace plan is definitely affordable and a lot cheaper than many other health
insurance plans available — and it provides coverage for a wider range of medical 
expenses than my previous plan did. I have friends and relatives that are in the same 
position that I am, and they struggle every year in finding reliable insurance. For the 
upcoming semester, I could definitely redirect them to the CAP HelpLine.
