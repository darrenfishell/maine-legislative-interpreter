207-324-5762  Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Committee on 
Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services. I am Megan Hannan, 
Executive Director of the Maine Community Action Partnership and we 
support LD  1077, “An Act to Fund Consultation Services to Ensure 
Affordable Health Care for Maine Residents.”  
 
For more than 50 years, Community Action has served as a dynamic and 
community -based force in addressing the causes and conditions of 
poverty t hroughout Maine and the country. Our ten Community Action 
Agencies (CAAs) deliver programs and services for people with low - and 
moderate- income, including the Home Energy Assistance Program, or 
HEAP; workforce development; the current rental relief program;  Head 
Start and more. Above all, our Mission is about equity: in economic 
opportunity, education and the opportunity to succeed.  
 Community Action Programs across the state play a vital role in providing 
outreach and education in an effort to assist Maine Families in obtaining 
health insurance coverage. Community Action Programs often rely on 
Maine’s Health Insurance Consumer Assistance Program (CAP) for 
information regarding changes in Maine’s health insurance Marketplace. 
Community Action staff involved in providing assistance to Mainers in 
need of health coverage often attend trainings convened by the CAP 
regarding Maine’s health insurance Marketplace including annual 
changes in plans and coverage and adjustments to Maine’s Marketplace 
(CoverMe.gov). Commu nity Action Program navigators often reach out to 
CAP staff for help with complicated cases where different family members 
might be eligible for different coverage, depending on family size and 
income.  
 We are particularly concerned about how the end of the public health 
emergency will effect health insurance coverage for families who have 
relied on MaineCare during the pandemic.  Many of the families are now 
back to work and will no longer qualify for MaineCare and will need help 
transitioning to private c overage on Maine’s Marketplace. Beginning May 
2023, Maine DHHS will redetermine eligibility for an estimated 17,000 
households, representing approximately MaineCare 31,000 members, 
each month through next April 2024.   It is estimated that 90,000 Mainers 
could lose MaineCare –  people who work but are not offered or who 
cannot afford employer -based coverage. Most will be able to purchase 
coverage through the Marketplace but will need help sorting through their options and enrolling in coverage, especially people in rural areas who 
don’t have ongoing access to the internet. Maine’s CAP will likely play an 
important role in helping people to transition to private Marketplace who 
may otherwise become uninsured.  
 Please support LD 1077.   Thank you.
