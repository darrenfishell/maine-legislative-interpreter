Re: LD 1077, An Act to Fund Consultation Services to Ensure Affordable Health Care for Maine 
Residents 
 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the HCIFS Committee: 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to share our comments neither for nor against L.D. 1077, “An Act 
to Fund Consultation Services to Ensure Affordable Health Care for Maine Residents.”  
 
This bill provides funding to support the Health Insurance Consumer Assistance Program 
(“HICAP”).  In the past, dedicated funds from the Bureau of Insurance (BOI) were swept to fund 
HICAP.  I have attached a letter that I recently shared with the Appropriations and Financial 
Affairs Committee describing how the advocacy role of HICAP differs from the regulatory role 
of BOI and why, therefore, HICAP should be funded through the general fund and not the 
Bureau’s special revenue funds.  If the Committee wishes to continue to fund HICAP, we 
strongly support measures to fund the program through the general fund, not through BOI’s 
dedicated revenue.   
 
While we support an appropriation from the general fund, the Office of the Attorney General 
(OAG) administers HICAP through a contract.  Therefore, the general fund appropriation should 
pass through the OAG rather than DHHS.  
 
Thank you, I would be happy to answer any questions at the work session. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Anne L. Head 
Commissioner, Department of Professional and Financial Regulation
