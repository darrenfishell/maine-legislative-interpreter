Testimony in Support of LD 1077, "An Act to Fund Consultation Services to Ensure 
Affordable Health Care for Maine Residents" 
April 4, 2023 
I experienced a job change at the end of the year and one of the most daunting and 
worrisome aspects of the process was finding (affordable) health insurance for my 
family. I found it difficult to find correct and clear information that would help me 
know what the options were and how to access them.
I called the Consumer Assistance Program Helpline. I spoke with a staff person who 
was so kind and helpful. She stayed in touch with me over the weeks, assisting me 
through the process, answering my many questions, and even got on a three-way call 
with me and other agencies. With the changes related to the Family Glitch and the 
nuances of Special Enrollment Periods, there was a lot for me to learn, but they stayed
with me every step of the way. I would not have known that it was possible to 
affordably insure my family without the CAP Helpline staff's steadfast, warm 
guidance.
