TESTIMONY IN OPPO SITION TO  
 
L.D. 999 
 
AN ACT TO SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS BY EXPANDING FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE  
 
Senator  Tipping, Representative  Roeder and members of the Committee on Labor and Housing. I am Steven 
Bailey , executive director  of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative 
committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents Association , in 
oppos ition to  L.D. 999. 
 
Superintendents are well  aware of situations where grandparents or great -grandparents are living with or 
being cared for by one of our school employees  and believe that is a situation that is becoming more 
prevalent. We try to be flexible , but our first obligation is to our students.  
 
This bill would take th e decision on whether to grant leave  out of our hands and allow staff to take Family 
Medical Leave to care for non -parent caregivers . It includes in that list grandparents, great -grandparents and 
others with a serious health risk w ho are related to the employee by “ blood, adoption, legal custody, marriage 
or domestic partnership. ” 
 
We believe that goes too far and could result in an unpredictable number of teachers being absent so they can 
do care taking at home.  
 
Caretaking for thos e in need is laudable , but it  should not come at the cost o f having our teachers absent from 
the classroom.  Leave can and is requested today in our districts, and is approved on a case -by-case basis. It is 
a local decision and should not be legislated.
