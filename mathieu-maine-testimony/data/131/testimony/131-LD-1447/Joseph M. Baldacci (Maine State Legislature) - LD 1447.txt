Sec. 1. Certified Nursing Assistant Training Instructors. Resolved: That the Department of Health and 
Human Sen/ices shall apply to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asking for a waiver 
regarding certified nursing assistant training instructors. Federal regulations require that the training of 
nurse aides must be performed by or under the general supervision of a registered nurse who possesses 
a minimum of 2 years of nursing experience, at least 1 year of which must be in the provision of long- 
term care facility services. The Department of Health and Humans Services shall request that registered 
nurses training nursing assistants have a minimum of 2 years of nursing experience and waive the 
requirement for one year of experience in a long term care setting.
