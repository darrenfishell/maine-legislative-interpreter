Presented by Representative MASON of Lisbon. 
Cosponsored by Senator LaFOUNTA1N of Kennebec and Representatives: COSTAIN of

DATE OF HEARING: March 20, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife Committee. I am Bill Swan, Director of Licensing and Registration at the 
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, speaking on behalf of the Department, in opposition 
to L.D. 434. 
This bill would increase the current ATV registration fees for resident and non-resident ATV 
owners if the owner does not belong to an ofﬁcial ATV club recognized by the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. 
While many ATV registrants could buy an ATV club membership and continue to pay the same 
ATV registration cost they pay today, those who choose not to pay for a club membership would 
pay the increased registration proposed in this bill. Depending on the number of customers that 
take advantage of the “club member discount ” , there could be a signiﬁcant loss of revenue to both 
MDIFW and ACF because of this legislation, as section “C” of the bill changes the current 
distribution for all registrations. 
In addition, the Department has concems with how a state-wide ATV club membership system 
would be administered. Unless this was done well, it could lead to much confusion and possible 
fraud. 
The Department would like to point out that the concept of a club membership discount was 
discussed by the most recent ATV Task Force and the group did not recommend it. 
While the Department is supportive of the concept of getting more ATV riders to join clubs, we 
cannot support this proposed legislation. 
I would be glad to answer any questions at this time or during the work session.
