INLAND FISHERIES AND WILDLIFE
IN OPPOSITION TO LD 434
An Act to Protect Landowners and Increase Safety on All-terrain Vehicle Trails by Increasing 
Funding to the ATV Recreational Management Fund 
March 20, 2023
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife, my name is Brian Bronson, and I am the Supervisor of the Off-Road 
Recreational Vehicles Program in the Bureau of Parks and Lands, Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry. I’m speaking in opposition to LD 434, An Act to Protect Landowners and 
Increase Safety on All-terrain Vehicle Trails by Increasing Funding to the ATV Recreational 
Management Fund. 
This bill would increase the Maine resident ATV registration fee by $30, raising it to $100 annually. 
It would also increase the non-resident ATV registration fee by $35, raising it to $150 annually, and 
increase the non-resident 7-day registration fee by $30, raising it to $130. 
Subsection 5.C. outlines the creation of a new discount for residents and non-residents belonging to 
an official Maine ATV Club. This new ATV registration fee structure would result in a potential fee 
reduction for non-residents of $45 annually, resulting in lost revenue. Creating a new subsection also 
impacts the Enforcement Fund by not directing $10 to the Fund for each non-resident club member 
registration. Additionally, the new registration classes would require changes to the Department of 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife’s Moses registration system and require a new process to provide the 
system with real-time club membership information. Both of these changes would be costly to 
develop.  
Lastly, this bill changes the use of funds within the ATV Recreational Management Program, which 
may limit the ATV Program’s ability to perform non-trail activities such as purchasing land or 
interest in land, new trail development, mapping activities, or research. This club member discount 
concept was discussed at length by the ATV Task Force, but ultimately the Task Force recommended 
against this type of legislation for many of the reasons noted here. We encourage ATV riders to join 
clubs but cannot support this legislation with such a significant impact on our program.
Thank you for your time. I would happily answer any questions now or at the work session.
