Testimony of Sarah Calder, MaineHealth 
In Support of LD 821, “Resolve, To Improve Access to 
Neurobehavioral Services ” 
Tuesday, March 21, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services, I am Sarah 
Calder, Senior Government Affairs Director at MaineHealth, and I am 
here to testify in support of LD 821 , “Resolve, To Improve Access to 
Neurobehavioral Services. ” 
MaineHealth is an integrated non-proﬁt health care system that provides a 
continuum of health care services to communities throughout Maine and 
New Hampshire. Every day, our over 22,000 care team members support 
our vision of “Working Together so Our Communities are the Healthiest 
in America” by providing a range of services from primary and specialty 
physician services to a continuum of behavioral health care services, 
community and tertiary hospital care, home health care and a lab. 
As I have shared with this Committee before, on any given day, 
approximately 70 patients are stuck in MaineHealth hospitals awaiting 
access to an appropriate level of care. Some of those patients have 
signiﬁcant behavioral challenges and complex medical needs that require 
short-term care until they can be stabilized in order to transition to a long- 
term care facility, like a neurobehavioral rehabilitation facility. 
Unfortunately, I had many examples of patients with a traumatic brain 
injury who are living in our hospitals awaiting a neurobehavioral 
rehabilitation bed, but there’s one story in particular that I’d like to share. 
A trauma patient was admitted to Maine Medical Center after a car 
accident in January, and was medically cleared for discharge toa 
neurobehavioral bed on March 5. On March 6, the patient’s insurance 
declined to continue providing coverage of the patient’s hospital stay as 
the patient no longer meets acute inpatient level of care. Like the many 
other patient stories I could have shared (many of whom having been 
living in the hospital for months), our social work team has not been able 
to secure a neurobehavioral rehabilitation bed for this patient. 
Keeping a patient in a hospital who no longer needs acute care not is 
patient-centered care — acute care hospitals are not designed, equipped, or 
staffed to best deal with the needs of patients who require long-term or 
rehabilitative care. Additionally, if We aren’t able to turn over beds to care

for acutely ill patients, it leads to long wait times in our Emergency Departments — or even 
diversion. 
The 129*“ Legislature supported similar legislation and directed the Department to develop a plan 
to provide 16 new neurobehavioral beds in the State. It is unclear if that plan was developed or 
presented to this Committee. With that said, I urge you to support this legislation to ensure that 
the beds are ﬁnally developed and our system of care is better equipped to provide the 
appropriate care to individuals with brain injury and behavioral health care needs. 
Thank you and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
