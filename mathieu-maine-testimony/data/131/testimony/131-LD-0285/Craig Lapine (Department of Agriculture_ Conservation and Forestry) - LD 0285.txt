TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON

IN SUPPORT OF LD 285 
An Act to Remove the Requirement for Wild Blueberry Transportation Permits 
February 13, 2023 
Senator Ingwerson, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Craig Lapine, and I am the Director of the 
Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources. I am speaking on behalf of the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry in support of LD 285, “An Act to Remove the 
Requirement for Wild Blueberry Transportation Permits. ” We thank Representative Perry for 
sponsoring the bill. 
The legislation requiring wild blueberry transport permits was passed in 1987. At that time, wild 
blueberries were enjoying high prices — and continued to do so for about the next twenty years. 
As a result, growers experienced wild blueberry theft from their ﬁelds. The loss of the valuable 
fruit was so disruptive and had such a negative ﬁnancial impact that the industry championed the 
requirement for permits. Requiring a paper trail for the transportation of more than 25 lbs. of 
wild blueberries helped deter theft, as did the penalties within the statute, making violators 
subject to prosecution for Class E or Class D crimes. 
Fast forward three and a half decades, and our wild blueberry industry is in a different position. 
Prices reached devastating lows over the past ten years. Though these have rebounded a bit, 
global competition from domestic cultivated blueberries, as well as Canadian wild blueberries, 
means that prices for Maine wild blueberries are far from those that inspired theft 30+ years ago. 
In an effort to reduce the regulatory burden and instead support wild blueberry growers in doing 
what they do best, which is to grow this delicious, healthy, and iconic fruit, the Department 
supports LD 285 to eliminate transport permits. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony today. I am happy to answer any questions 
now or during the work session.
