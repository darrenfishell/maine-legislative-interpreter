Testifying Ought To Pass , LD 728, An Act to Amend the Bag Limit for Turkey  
Senator LaFountian, Representative Landry, and esteemed members of the Committee On Inland 
Fisheries  and Wildlife, my name is Tara Munroe and I am the Student Aid at the Wild Blueberry 
Commission of Maine. I am testifying before you today in support of this legislation . 
The Wild Blueberry Commission works on behalf of 4851 wild blueberry farmers and businesses  who 
grow wild blueberries on approximately 4 2,0002 acres across the state  and Passamaquoddy  lands . 
Maine’s growers often produce crops exceeding 100 million pounds that supply markets in Maine to 
California, and across the globe.  
In Maine's wild blueberry fields, turkeys are a  significant pest . The Department of Inland Fisheries  and 
Wildlife ’s own surveys have made clear that Maine’s wild blueberry growers share a concern about crop 
damage  from wild turkeys , and the economic impact that turkey depredatio n has on the ir business .3 
The National Wild Turkey Feder ation describes turkeys as  “opportunistic feeder s.”4 When they find a 
wild blueb erry field full of ripe berries, they take full  advantage. Consider that  Maine ’s turkey flocks 
regularly  exceed 50 individuals,  and that they knock as many berries off  the plants as they eat, 5 it’s no 
wonder that farmers consider them a nuisance .  
The Commission applauds  the State ’s successful efforts to repopulate wi ld turkeys . Today ’s populations 
are estimated at around 60,000 birds6 and they  can be found in all 16 counties . However, such an

Even if the turkeys were to avoid the berries, their mere presence i n fields is  enough to cause econo mic 
hardship . Under §112.112 of the  U.S. Food Saf ety Modernization Act ’s Produce Safety Rule , crops 
contaminated  by, e.g., animal droppings, should not be harvested , and if they are unintenti onally 
harvested, must be disposed o f. Large fl ocks of these birds are prob lematic in  blueberry fields.  
We expect that by increasing bag limits for wild tu rkeys , the state will have a greater ability to manage 
the wild turkey population at a reasonable level , helping to reduce tu rkey depredation and 
conta mination of crops . 
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
