RE:  LD 600 An Act to Expand Availability of Naloxone Hydrochloride
Let me express my appreciation to the sponsors of this bill and to those who have indicated 
support of this much needed provision. As the co-chair of the Mayoral ad hoc committee of 
Substance misuse and recovery for the City of Lewiston, I have had the great privilege of 
working alongside many stakeholders, committed to addressing the horrific epidemic before 
us. Maine experienced 716 overdose deaths in 2022. While much is being done to address 
the disease of substance use disorder, much more needs to be done. Increasing the 
availability of life-saving Narcan is so important. I lost my own son to an accidental overdose 
in 2020. So many lives are being lost to SUD and what we do know is that an overdose can 
be reversed if Narcan is available. 
Maintaining naloxone hydrochloride in a visible and publicly accessible wall-mounted box or 
other container in municipal places to be used by a member of the public in response to an 
opioid-related drug overdose not only makes sense in the name of humanity, but also is the 
right thing for a municipality to do.  
Furthermore, the bill also provide immunity from criminal and civil liability to municipalities and
overdose prevention programs for providing or maintaining the naloxone hydrochloride 
containers. This is also very important. 
Representatives, please vote in favor of LD 660. 
Thank you for your consideration
