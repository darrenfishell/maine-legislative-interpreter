Testimony of Victoria Foley 
Neither for nor against LD 1115 
An Act Regarding Economic Development Funds for Federally Recognized 
Indian Tribes 
Good afternoon, Sen. Cmry, Rep. Roberts, and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Imiovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business. I am Victoria Foley, legislative 
liaison for the Department of Economic and Community Development, and I am testifying neither 
for nor against LD l l 15. 
As the bill is currently drafted, DECD is not able to fulﬁll the bill’s obligations. This is due to 
statutory limitations that prevent the state CDBG program from distributing funds directly to tribal 
communities. Per Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 570.480 subpart g of the 
Housing and Community Development Act, States shall make CDBG program grants only to units 
of general local govermnent. 
Tribal communities, with the partnership of local government entities, are able to apply to the state 
CDBG program in addition to the ICDBG program ~ the Indian Community Development Block 
Grant program, administered by the federal government. In past years, our Ofﬁce of Community 
Development has worked with tribal communities - through their municipal/local government 
partners - to distribute CDBG funding for projects. For example, in the year 2000, We awarded 
$300,000 to Eastport for Housing rehabilitation in Quoddy Village, and in 2011, we awarded 
$150,000 to Old Town so Four Directions could do a Native Micro-Enterprise program. 
The second portion of the bill as drafted asks the Department of Economic and Community 
Development to develop, in consultation with federally recognized Indian tribes in this State,a 
plan for ensuring those tribes have equitable access to the New Markets Tax Credit Program 
administered through the United States Department of the Treasu1y's Community Development 
Financial Institutions Fund. We understand the sponsor’s intent in reducing barriers to program 
usage by tribal communities. However, at present, the state, and our department, have no inﬂuence 
with the administration of new markets tax credits. As a result, there is no mechanism for the 
department to provide feedback to the federal govermnent on the program.

The good news is that there are ways we can collaborate with and reduce barriers for tribal 
communities when it comes to interacting with our statewide community development block grant 
program, including through the provision of technical support for CDBG grant applications. Since 
the bill was printed, we have engaged directly with the sponsor and with the leadership team of 
Four Directions Development Corporation. We look forward to continuing these conversations to 
further support tribal communities in accessing technical support for CDBG grant applications. 
Thank you for your time today, and for the opportunity to share some of the background and 
discussions we have been having on this important topic. I would be happy to answer any questions 
or provide additional information for your work session.
