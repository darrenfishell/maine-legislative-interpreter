LD 1507: An Act to Ensure the Accuracy of Vltal Records wlth Respect to Gender 
Apnl 26, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representat1ve Moonen, and honorable members of the Judlcrary 
Commlttee my name 1s G1a Drew, and I am the executlve d1rector of Equal1tyMa1ne, 
Wh1ch has been advocatlng on behalf of Ma1ne’s LGBTQ+ communlty slnce 1984 
I’m here today on behalf of Equal1tyMa1ne, GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders 
(GLAD), and ACLU of Mame We fully support the v1s1on of acknowledglng and honorlng 
d1verse gender 1dent1t1es, allowlng Mamers to be seen for who they are not only durlng the1r 
l1fet1mes but also through the key events of thelr l1ves as they are preserved 1n the annals of 
hlstory The beneﬁts of th1s b1ll, Wh1Cl'l 1s concerned w1th the amendment of a marnage 
cernﬁcate to reﬂect a change of gender as well as the notat1on of gender 1dent1ty on a death 
cert1ﬁcate, go even beyond treatmg people w1th d1gn1ty The collectlon of qual1ty data 1s 
essentlal for 1nformed analys1s across many toplcs, espec1ally 1n healthcare, and there has 
been a w1dely-1dent1 ﬁed need for more ent1t1es to 1I1'lpI‘OV6 and expand thelr efforts to collect 
lnformatlon on sexual orlentatlon and gender 1dent1ty (SOGI) Add1t1onally, allowlng for 
amendment of a marr1age certrﬁcate and des1gnat1on of gender 1dent1ty on a death certlﬁcate 
would ensure that there are fewer 1ncons1stenc1es among var1ous documents, WhlCl'1 lead to 
bureaucratlc delays, 1neff1c1enc1es, and frustratlon The legal and soc1al obstacles presented 
by lnaccurate gender markers on ofﬁclal documents can be great barrlers to healthcare, 
housmg, and more 
Two of our constltuents told us the1r story, and I’d l1ke to share 1t wlth you to 1llustrate the 
lmportance of th1s b1ll J and H got marrled 1n Mame 20 years ago, and J was hsted 1n the 
“Groom Sect1on” and H was l1sted 1n the “Brlde Sect1on ” Smce that tlme, Ma1ne has 
changed these sectlons of the ceruﬁcate to read “Party A” and “Party B” w1th optlons for 
“Bnde,” “Groom,” and “Spouse,” and added a sectlon for “Sex” w1th two optrons “Female” 
and “Male ” But, also slnce 2003, J learned that she 1s a transgender woman, andH 
d1scovered that a gender marker of X ﬁts them best Currently, J and H have no way to 
update thelr marr1age certlﬁcate to reﬂect who they are That means that every tlme they 
need proof of the1r marnage for taxes, lnsurance, bankmg, mortgage apphcatlons, thelr 
ch1ldren, and so forth, they need to produce thls mean1ngful, yet lnaccurate and fraught 
document They have no recourse aga1nst the stress that th1s causes for both of them, notto
mentlon the add1t1onal burden of needmg to provlde even more documents as further 
substant1at1on and the confus1on that ensues LD 1507 would allow th1s couple and many 
others to amend the1r marrlage certrficate so that 1t 1s correct and no longer a source of 
d1scomfort and fmstranon 
W1th the understand1ng that the tenn “sex ldentlﬁer” was l1kely ut1l1zed 1n the b1l1’s language 
to account for the current “Appl1cat1on for Cernﬁcate of Mar1tal Status 1n Mame” and “State 
of Malne Llcense and Cert1ﬁcate of Marnage” documents ’ use of the term “Sex,” we would 
however suggest that both of these forms be updated to request “Gender Identlty ” 1nstead, as 
a person’s gender may not ahgn w1th the1r sex There are people whose sex 1s not s1mply 
female or male, some people are both female and male, ne1ther female nor male, or havea 
varlety of sex tra1ts, and/or chromosomes, 1nclud1ng people who are 1ntersex Gender 
1dent1ty, as deﬁned by the Ma1ne Human R1ghts Act, "means the gender-related 1dent1ty, 
appearance, manner1sms or other gender-related characterlstlcs of an 1nd1v1dual, regardless of 
the 1nd1v1dual's asslgned sex at b1rth ”‘ Whlle 1t may appear to be a d1scuss1on of semantlcs, 
conslstent use of appropr1ate term1nology W111 help ensure that data 1s as accurate as posslble 
We urge you to support th1s b1ll and vote Ought To Pass on LD 1507 Let’s afﬁnn all Ma1ners 
through the developments of the1r l1ves and respect who they really were upon and after the1r 
deaths 
Thank you,
