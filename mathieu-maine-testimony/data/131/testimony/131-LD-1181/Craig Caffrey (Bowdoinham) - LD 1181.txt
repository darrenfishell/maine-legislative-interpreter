LD 1181 “An Act to Allow for the Recall of an Elected Municipal Official for Any 
Reason” 
 
 Good morning Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and the Committee of State and Local 
Government. My name is Craig Caffrey of Bowdoinham, and I am submitting my testimony in support of 
LD 1181 “An Act to Allow for the Recall of an Elected Municipal Official for Any Reason.” 
 
As a Veteran with over two decades of service, I am appalled to come home and find how 
dysfunctional our local and state government officials act towards the everyday citizen. It is imperative 
to hold all public servants, including elected officials, accountable for their actions when they go against 
the wishes and concerns of the constituents. By passing this bill, it’ll put those on notice who provide 
substandard services, disrespect, and lack of concern towards their constituents on notice, do your job 
or you can and will be replaced. This is called accountability, something that is severely lacking in today’s 
society.  
 
I request this committee to vote “ought to pass” LD 1181 “An Act to Allow for the Recall of an 
Elected Municipal Official for Any Reason.” 
 
Thank you for your time, 
Craig Caffrey 
Bowdoinham 
Chief Petty Officer USN (Ret.)
