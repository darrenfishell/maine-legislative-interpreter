In Opposition to  
LD 1181 - An Act to Allow for the Recall of an Elected Municipal Official for Any Reason  
April 21, 2023
 
 
Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, and members of the State and Local Government Committee, my name is Rebecca 
Lambert, and I am testifying today in opposition to LD 1 181 on behalf of the  Maine Municipal Association’s (MMA) 
elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC).  
 Municipalities across Maine currently have the ability to adopt ordinances that allow for the recall of 
municipal officials. For example, the Town of Madison has a “Recall of Elected Officials” ordinance that details the 
procedure for voters to conduct a recall petition  for an elected official.  
 There was some concern among local leaders that school board members are not included in this bill 
proposal but understan d that LD 1102, also brought forth this session, aims to address this issue. Communities 
appreciate the attempt to hold all elected officials to the same standards.  
 Due to municipalities having the ability to adopt ordinances for the recall of elected officials, the LPC feels 
this bill is unnecessary .  
For these reasons we kindl y urge the committee to vote ought not to pass on LD 1181.  Thank you for your 
time and for considering the municipal  perspective on this issue.
