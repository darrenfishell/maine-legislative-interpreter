Janice Vance
Kennebunk
LD 1181
Good morning, Senator Nangle, Rep. Stover, and members of the Committee on State
and Local Government.  My name is Janice Vance and I am a resident of Kennebunk. 
I am unable to attend today’s public hearing due to a work conflict. I wanted to weigh
in as being opposed to LD 1181, which eliminates the current language in the state 
charter that stipulates an elected official must commit a crime in order to be recalled. I
suppose the bill author thought he was providing flexibility by including the phrase 
“except as otherwise provided by the municipality’s ordinances or charter.” The issue 
is that there are a whole lot of Maine towns that don’t have ANY language about 
recalls in their ordinances or charter, because they rely on the state language.  Without
that protection, those towns will be wide open to abuse by people who really enjoy 
making baseless and malicious accusations against elected officials. This happened 
last year in our town, and it divided the community, required 420 Town staff hours to 
certify the petition, and resulted in a lawsuit, the cost of which was paid for taxpayers.
After all that, it was unsuccessful because the two school board members being 
targeted were not guilty of anything, and voters knew it. Please keep the existing State
language the same. Thank you for your consideration.
