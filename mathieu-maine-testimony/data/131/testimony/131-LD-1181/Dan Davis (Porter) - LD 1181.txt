LD 1181
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the State and Local 
Government Committee,
I represent no entity or agency other than myself, and write to testify in support of 
LD1181.
The extended pandemic isolation measures we all experienced was a practice, and an 
unfortunate catalyst that fostered an increasing contempt for democracy, transparency,
and accountability at the local level of governance, by giving officials an experience, 
however temporary, of unilateral authority. 
This side effect has threatened civil liberties and is an affront to healthy civil 
discourse, diversity of ideas, civic participation, and succession.
The current law has been and continues to be too narrow to be applicable in this world
and this era, and was not even worth codifying into law. It needs to be amended, and 
this is attempted session after session in the legislature (even before the pandemic), 
indicating need.
I urge the Committee to vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD1181, as it is a common-sense 
and reasonable piece of legislation that restores accountability at the local level and 
reduces the distance between the citizenry and their government.
This piece of legislation is in the best interest of ALL Mainers.
Thank you,
Dan
