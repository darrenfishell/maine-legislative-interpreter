Stephen Sayers
Kennebunk
LD 1181
To: Senator Nangle, Rep. Stover, and Honorable Members of the Committee on State 
and Local Government: my name is Stephen Sayers and I wish to speak IN 
OPPOSITION TO LD 1181. I am a resident of Kennebunk. Currently, the statute that 
authorizes recall of a municipal official provides that the official can be recalled "only
if the official is convicted of a crime, the conduct of which occurred during the 
official's term of office and the victim of which is the municipality." Maine R.S.A., 
Tit. 30A, Sec. 2505(9). LD 1181 seems not to have been the subject of any serious 
study or analysis, and it would transform a statute that is available only under one 
narrow and specific set of facts, to one that would be generally available to anyone, at
any time, and for any reason, at a disgruntled petitioner's whim. I submit that this is a 
dangerous proposal. It would amount to no less than "open season" on any elected 
official, and would provoke and inflame divisiveness in the community rather than 
fostering harmony, civil discourse and good government, which should be the guiding
objective of any responsible legislator. Frankly, it is difficult to treat this as a serious 
proposal. It would blast open the floodgates of litigation, much of it politically driven 
or entirely frivolous. In addition, such imprudent legislation would be likely to subject
Maine communities to increasing political polarization, increased local strife and a 
state of virtually perpetual electioneering.
