Testimony on Behalf of Maine Equal Justice in support of LD 849, An Act to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Working Group to Review the Process for Ongoing Review of Tax 
Expenditures by the Legislature 
April 21, 2023 
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My name is Ann 
Danforth and I use she/her pronouns. I’m a Policy Advocate at Maine Equal Justice, a nonprofit legal aid 
provider working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 849, as I was not able to present it 
at the hearing on April 18th.  
Maine Equal Justice supports inclusion of takeup rate 
In October, 2021, Maine Equal Justice provided recommendations to the Working Group to Review the 
Process of Ongoing Review of Tax Expenditures by the Legislature. We encouraged the group to consider 
including take-up rates for individual programs (and particularly those geared towards people with low 
income) as a key measure of the program’s effectiveness. We are heartened that their final report 
included this suggestion, and that it continues to be included in LD 849: 
Sec. 12. 36 MRSA §199-B, sub-§1, ¶G is enacted to read:  
G. For tax expenditures intended primarily to enhance economic security for individuals with 
low income or to provide other economic assistance to individual taxpayers, an assessment of 
the number of taxpayers taking advantage of the tax expenditure compared to the number of 
individuals estimated to be eligible for the tax expenditure. 
Importance of tax credits to people with low income and the state’s economy 
Refundable tax credits are increasingly becoming a key feature of our safety net and play a critical role in 
the economic security of Mainers with low income. For example, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is 
widely recognized as one of the best antipoverty programs for working families. The extra money 
provided by the EITC can help working people meet basic needs and maintain employment. The EITC has 
also been shown to improve health outcomes, educational outcomes, and future earnings outcomes for 
children.1 Furthermore, tax credits boost state and local economies as families spend their EITCs on 
purchases like cars and routine bills and expenses.2 
 
These benefits and spending patterns are also reflected in the way people spent their stimulus 
payments, unemployment benefits from federal COVID relief, and Child Tax Credit payments.3 4  
 
Similarly, refundable tax credits like the state Property Tax Fairness Credit (PTFC) and Sales Tax Fairness 
Credit (STFC) play an important role for Maine families, and also help make our tax system more 
equitable.5  
 
Many tax credits are not reaching those who need them most 
 
While the benefits of refundable tax credits are clear, unfortunately, often they don’t actually reach the 
people who need them the most.  
 
In 2020, Maine Equal Justice participated in the Maine Working Group to Study the Consolidation of 
Payment of Cost-of-living Tax Credits. The group learned that many Mainers who are eligible for state 
cost of living tax credits, including the EITC, STFC, and PTFC are not receiving them. This is especially true 
when it comes to certain people eligible for the PTFC, which is a refundable credit for taxpayers whose 
property tax or rent exceeds a certain percentage of their income. 
According to data provided by MRS, a rough estimate is that PTFC take-up is 60-70% among people who 
file a Maine income tax return, but drops to an overall take up rate of 45-55% when non-filers are also 
counted among the eligible. For homeowners in 2015, the ratio of PTFC claims to the estimated total 
eligible filers is about 66%; including non-filers drops this ratio to 46.4%. Importantly for renters, in 2015, 
the ratio of PTFC claims to the estimated total eligible filers is about 42%; but when non-filers are 
included this ratio drops to 28%.  
We believe that one of the biggest reasons for low uptake rates among people eligible for tax credits – 
particularly state tax credits – is people’s lack of awareness about their eligibility.  
State should take responsibility for improving uptake rates 
Whether the intended recipients are actually receiving a tax benefit is a critical measure of a program’s 
effectiveness. Just as MRS has an obligation to collect taxes, it also has an obligation to ensure people 
are aware of and able to access tax credits for which they are eligible. In the same way that the State of 
Maine has implemented procedures to ensure that Mainers file taxes, the State should put into place 
procedures that ensure that Mainers receive the tax credits for which they are eligible. Getting data on

4 According to US Census data, among households that spent their stimulus checks, people most frequently spent 
it on things like food, rent, mortgage and/or utilities, household supplies and personal care products, and clothing.

take-up rates – which Mainers are getting certain tax credits – will enable the Taxation Committee to 
better develop and enact ideas for how the state could improve them. 
  
We understand from MRS’ testimony that they have concerns about their ability to accurately estimate 
non-claimants. While we believe even rough estimates, like those provided by MRS to the Working 
Group to Study the Consolidation of Payment of Cost-of-Living Tax Credits in 2020 (which I’m attaching 
with my testimony) are helpful, if the committee decides this poses too much of an administrative 
burden, we hope the Committee may still consider asking MRS to report on certain known 
characteristics of those who have received the credits. This data could include:  
 
● Number of people who receive EITC/property/sales/childcare tax credits and their 
demographics (age, income, geographical distribution by county, family composition, renter or 
homeowner (for PTFC)) 
● The average amount people receive in tax credits (broken out by credit and percentile) 
● The most common reasons people are rejected for these tax credits  
 
Conclusion 
Programs are only effective if they are known to and accessible to the people they are intended to 
benefit. Measuring take-up rates, or at the very least, having more information on who is receiving 
certain tax credits, will help the state develop and execute strategies to make them more effective, 
thereby improving people’s economic security and improving and stimulating the state’s economy.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on this bill. Please reach out to me with any

Responses provided by MRS to the Working Group to Study the Consolidation of Payment of Cost-of-
Living Tax Credits in 2020 
 
Questions 1 & 3 
The statistics requests for MRS can be divided into questions that can be answered with tax 
data (1 & 3) and questions related to participation and non-filers (2 & 4). 
For questions 1 and 3 we present data for tax year 2017 rather than 2018 for data 
completeness.  For example, for tax year 2017, the property tax fairness credit increased by 
5.5% between now and this time last year.     
Table 1 provides the information requested in question #1 for full-year resident taxpayers in 
2017.  All data is from Maine 1040s.  Credit amounts less than $5 are ignored.  Taxpayers do 
not report race on the tax return and therefore statistics by race are not included.   
Table 2 shows a more detailed age distribution for the under 65 population.  We show the 
percentage distribution because of some minor data discrepancies.6   
Table 3 provides information on the distribution of positive credits; this table answers Question 
3. 
A few notes: 
• The PTFC credit rate doubled in 2018 and the maximum credit increased from $600/$900 
to $750/$1200 for under 65/65 and older.  In 2020 the credit increases from the amount 
that property tax exceeds 6% of income to the amount exceeding 5% of income. 
• The refundable child care credit is fundamentally different than the EITC, PTFC, and STFC 
because the credit is limited to 25% of federal tax liability (50% for quality child care). 
 
 
 
 
6 There are 3 sources of age information: the check box on the front of the Maine 1040 for 65+ Y/N, birthdates 
reported on the Schedule PTFC for a subset of taxpayers, and information from the IRS, which is not 100% 
matched to Maine returns and, at the moment, is missing spouse DOB in the extract available internally to 
OTP.

Question 2 
While we understand the relevance of this question to the working group, we cannot reliably 
estimate participation rates for each refundable credit. We have tax return data, but eligibility 
estimates also require high-quality data on non-filers as well as additional variables from non-
claimant filers.  Instead, we can informally offer insights about each credit, and, in the case of 
the EITC, provide some national estimates on participation. 
EITC 
Nonparticipation in the Maine EITC can be divided into two categories: 1) Taxpayers who are 
eligible for but do not claim the federal EITC; and 2) Taxpayers who claim the federal EITC but 
not the Maine EITC.   
With respect to the federal EITC, Plueger (2009) estimates a 75.3% participation rate based on 
exact matches of IRS and CPS ASEC data.7    Highlights of these results, with table references, 
include: 
• For eligible non-claimants, 64.8% did not file a tax return (Table 8). 
• Participation rates increase with the number of qualifying children: The rates are 55.6% for 
childless adults, 73.6% for families with one child, and 85.9% for families with two or more 
qualifying children.  (Table 9) 
•  Participation rates are generally increasing with the credit amount (Table 11).  For 
example, the participation rate for EITC amounts under $500 is 56% and for EITC amounts 
greater than $2,000 is 86%.

Paper No. 2014-04.  Washington, D.C.: U.S. Census Bureau, July. 
 
Bhargava and Manoli (2015) 9 and Nichols and Rothstein (2015)10 both include brief literature 
reviews of the EITC participation literature.   
Participation in the Maine EITC will be lower than the federal EITC because claiming the federal 
EITC is a requirement of the Maine EITC.  IRS statistics show 103,120 EITC claims to 
taxpayers with a Maine address totaling $211.97 million in 2016.11  There are 95,827 Maine full-
year resident EITCs that, when divided by the Maine credit rate (5%), total $201.8 million in 
2016.  Comparing the federal and state numbers, about 93% of federal EITC claimants also 
claim their Maine EITC, and the amount of Maine claimed is about 95% of the amount that could 
be claimed holding federal participation constant.12  
Property Tax Fairness Credit (PTFC) 
We believe that we overestimate eligibility for the PTFC.  For homeowners, this belief is partially 
based on some work for tax year 2013 where we matched property tax rolls for a large number 
of towns to Maine 1040s.  We also have concerns about data on rents paid by families leading 
to an overestimate of renter eligibility.   
• For homeowners in 2015, the ratio of PTFC claims to the estimated total eligible filers is 
about 66%; including non-filers drops this ratio to 46.4%. 
• For renters in 2015, the ratio of PTFC claims to the estimated total eligible filers is about 
42%; including non-filers drops this ratio to 28%. 
o The number of eligible renters seems likely to be overstated.  Generally anyone who 
receives a housing subsidy that requires the recipient to spend 30% of income on 
rent is ineligible for the PTFC. 
• Estimated PTFC Claims / # eligible is higher for the elderly: 82.7% vs 49.3% for filers, 44% 
vs 37% including non-filers.13 
• Excluding non-filers, PTFC Claims / # eligible is highest for taxpayers with income under 
$10,000 (59%) but this is not true when non-filers are included. 
A rough guestimate is that PTFC take-up is 60-70% among people who file a Maine income tax 
return, and drops to 45-55% when non-filers are also counted among the eligible.    Estimates 
for any subpopulation are even more uncertain and estimates by geography are not available.

Benefits: Evidence from an IRS Field Experiment,” American Economic Review 2015, 105(11): 3489–3529.  
The authors also note the challenges of estimating program participation: “Despite considerable interest in 
the question, accurately measuring take-up of the EITC (i.e., eligible claimants/eligible individuals) is difficult. 
The difficulty stems from the unknown rate of ineligible claiming, the presence of unobservable factors that 
determine eligibility, such as qualified dependent status, and because one cannot simply assume that eligible 
non-claimants and claimants, even conditioned on observable characteristics, are otherwise similar (Berube 
2006).”  Page 3496.

12 Adjusting the Maine EITC calculation by subtracting full-year residents with a non-Maine address and 
adding part-year residents with a Maine address yields almost identical results.  
13 A possible explanation for this estimate is that more elderly file a return to claim a PTFC. 
 
 Sales Tax Fairness Credit 
We estimate that credit take up among filers is high.  (The participation rate among people who 
filed an income tax return is somewhere in the high 90s percent based on a quick model 
estimate, but there is a little more work needed to nail it down.) 
Almost all non-dependent non-filers (over 90%), however, would be eligible for the credit.  Our 
estimates of the number of non-filer tax unit fluctuates somewhat year-to-year with our return 
count, but assuming non-dependent 80,000 tax filing units is reasonable estimate.   
Our non-filer population is disproportionately elderly, probably because social security income is 
non-taxable and comprises a large share of total income for many elderly households.      
A rough back-of-the-envelope is around a 72% participation rate.  
Child care credit 
We have no comments or estimates about participation in this credit.

We do not have a reliable answer to this question.
