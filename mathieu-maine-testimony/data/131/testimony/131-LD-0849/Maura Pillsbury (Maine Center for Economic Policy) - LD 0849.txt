Testimony in Support of LD 849, An Act To Implement the Recommendations of the 
Working Group To Review the Process for Ongoing Review of Tax Expenditures by the 
Legislature  
April 18, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Taxation, my name 
is Maura Pillsbury and I am an analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Policy (MECEP). I am 
here today to testify in support of LD 849. 
The tax expenditure review process conducted by the Office of Program Evaluation and 
Government Accountability (OPEGA) is crucial to our understanding of the effectiveness of tax 
expenditures, including credits, exemptions, and refunds, that have an impact on state revenue. 
Tax expenditures have a significant cost to state resources, and we should know if the 
programs are working as intended. The Legislature, public, and agencies should understand 
how well the programs are working and opportunities to improve them. And lawmakers need 
to be able to weigh the benefit of tax expenditures against other types of investments in our 
state like education, affordable health care and other services families and businesses rely on.  
LD 849 would improve the tax expenditure review process in several ways, all of which MECEP 
supports. These include:  
 changes to streamline the process of collaboration between committees involved in the 
tax expenditure review process 
 facilitating the future evaluation of existing tax expenditures through the creation of a 
task force to determine if existing statutes include the necessary provisions for full 
evaluation 
 facilitating the future evaluation of new tax expenditures by creating a process to ensure 
the necessary provisions for full evaluation are included in pending legislation  
 speeding up the process to get information quickly from OPEGA on a limited number of 
pending bills to help inform the creation of new tax expenditures 
 changes to improve the efficiency of full and expedited reviews 
 requiring MRS to provided information to facilitate expedited reviews

In addition to the improvements set forth in LD 849, the Tax Expenditure Review Working 
Group reporti recommended the following measures, which we urge the Committee to 
consider including: 
 Provide additional staff resources to OPEGA. Maine has one of the most robust tax 
expenditure review programs but also has among the smallest staff, with two FTEs in 
funding to complete reviews. Increasing analytic capacity by adding staff positions 
would help OPEGA accelerate its review timeline and complete the additional tasks 
assigned by this bill. 
 Expand the work of the Full Evaluation Task Force to include data-related 
evaluation issues. In line with the TERWG report, we support that the Full Evaluation 
Task Force undertake: 
o reviewing best practices in other states regarding data sharing processes 
between evaluation offices and relevant state agencies, and developing proposals 
for improvements 
o identifying standardized processes and formats for collecting and reporting data 
related to tax expenditures and recipients by relevant state agencies. 
Thank you for your time and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. I am 
available as a resource.
