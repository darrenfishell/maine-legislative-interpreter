Testimony of Rep. T avis Hasenfus introducing 
LD 10, An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Invasive Aquatic Plants 
Before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee 
Senator BI'6I1I1 €1' , Representative Gramlich and distinguished members of the Environment and 
Natural Resources Committee. My name is Tavis Hasenfus, and I represent House District 57 
and the communities of Readﬁeld and Winthrop. I am here before you today to present LD 10, 
An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Invasive Aquatic Plants. 
This is a bill from the Department of Environmental Protection, and I expect you’ll hear directly 
from the experts as to why this bill is necessary. 
In my own words, this is a relatively simple change to the invasive species statute located in Title 
38. The changes listed in the bill are intended to bring Maine’s laws up to date in order to better 
address the current threats to our inland waters. This will provide clarity and allow state agencies 
to focus their attention on the species that pose the most signiﬁcant risk to the health and 
sustainability of our lakes and rivers. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to answer any questions you have for 
me, but you may wish to save the technical questions for representatives from DEP. 
District 57: Readﬁeld and Winthrop
