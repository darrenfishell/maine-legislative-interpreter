Dear Members of the Committee,
My name is Debbie Broderick; I live year round on Lake Arrowhead in York 
Country. I am a member of the Lake Arrowhead Conservation Council and I am a 
certified Invasive Plant Patroller through the Lake Stewards of Maine. I do very 
frequent and regular surveys of our lake. Since becoming a patroller of our littoral 
zone in 2020, I have discovered 2 new invasive plants in our lake, in addition to the 
well-established Variable water-milfoil that we have been trying to manage for at 
least 17 years.
One of the plants I've detected growing in our lake (Utricularia inflata) is not yet on 
the state's recognized Invasive Species List. It is widespread and well established in 
our lake and I have seen it exhibit the same characteristics in Horseshoe Pond in 
Chesterville, Maine. We need to recognize its establishment and ability to dominate 
and crowd out native plants. 
In order to successfully manage this invasive species, we need to have it placed on the
state's "Invasive Aquatic Plants" List. Please help us maintain the integrity of our 
native aquatic species populations by including Utricularia inflata in the recognized 
non-native species list.
Many thanks for your time and consideration,
Debbie Broderick.
