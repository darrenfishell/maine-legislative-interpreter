Good Afternoon Sen. Grohoski, Rep. Perry and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation. My name is Linda Capraral am the Vice President of Advocacy for the Maine State 
Chamber of Commerce and a resident of Winthrop. I am here today to speak in support of L.D. 
1313, An Act to Amend the Tax Credit for Maj or Business Headquarters Expansions Regarding 
Employees Locations and Time of Hire for Purposes of this Credit. 
We support this bill because we feel the amendment is purely a technical change. The bill just 
amends the headquarters credit to allow a company to count employees working at any location 
in the state to be counted as employees under the credit. As a result of the pandemic, many 
employees are choosing to work from home or on hybrid work models, and this technical 
amendment simply recognizes that shift. This is good policy because workplace ﬂexibility is 
extremely important in attracting and retaining employees and those employees who are able to 
Work from home some or all of the time should still be counted as headquarters employees for 
purposes of the credit.. So, it shouldn’t matter where they do their job as long as they work “in 
state” for purposes of the “headquarters ” requirement. 
Again, please support L.D. 1313 and I’d be happy to answer any questions.
