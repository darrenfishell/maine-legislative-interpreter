Re: LD 757 â€“ An Act to Expand Telemonitoring for MaineCare Patients  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide information for your deliberations on  LD 757, An Act to Expand 
Telemonitoring for MaineCare Patients . Because this service  is already offered, the Department 
opposes this bill.  
 
This bill amends the law governing MaineCare services delivered t hrough telehealth to change 
the rule -making authority of the Department of Health and Human Services, providing that 
qualifying criteria for telemonitoring services include documentation in a patient's medical 
record that the patient may be hospitalized or  admitted or readmitted to an emergency room at 
the discretion of the patient's health care provider. It also conditions MaineCare coverage for 
telemonitoring services on the intention to collect a patient's health -related data to assist in 
monitoring and assessing the patient's health status, telemonitoring's being medically necessary, 
the patient's capacity to participate in telemonitoring , and the patient's having a suitable 
residence for telemonitoring.  
 
As written, the bill does not make a meaningful difference to how MaineCare already covers 
telemonitoring services. MaineCare already covers telemonitoring in the instances noted in the 
bill. Providers may provide telemonitoring as presented in Ch. I, Sect ion 4 , Telehealth Services  
and Ch. II, Section 40 , Home Health Services  of the M aineCare Benefits Manual . Additionally , 
current utilization of telemonitoring services is low. In Fiscal Year 2022, providers sought less 
than $30,000 in  MaineCare  telemonitori ng reimbursement . 
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director  
MaineCare Services
