RE: LD 757, An Act to Expand Telemonitoring for MaineCare Patients  
 
 
Dear Chairs and Members of the Committee,  
 
On behalf of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), I am writing 
to you in support of LD 757, which would expand access to telemonitoring for 
Maine Care.  
 
AdvaMed is the largest medical technology association, representing the innovators 
and manufacturers transforming health care through earlier disease detection, less 
invasive procedures, and more effective treatments. Our more than 450 members 
range from emerging companies to large multinationals, and include traditional 
device, diagnostic , and digital health technology companies.  AdvaMed members are 
proud to have a footprint in Maine , where the med tech industry generates $269.2 
million a year and susta ins nearly 1,300 high paying jobs in the state.  
 
Millions of patientsâ€™ lives are improved every day because of advancements in 
medical technology. Medical technology companies strive to innovate and develop 
the best tools to diagnose and treat patients.  LD 757 would increase access to 
critical and timely healthcare  for nearly 106,509 people  enrolled in MaineCare as of 
February 1, 2023. This impacts patients with diabetes, hypertension, congestive 
heart failure, kidney disease, COPD and high -risk pregnancies .  Importantly, 
increasing this access would also help reduce health disparities across a variety of 
socio-economic populations in the state.

As a matter of economic development, LD 757 would enable businesses to offer 
residents in Maine better access to healthcare when otherwise this choice may not 
be available. It is well known  that businesses locate where their employees have 
access to healthcare. If a county does not have access to healthcare, it makes it 
much more difficult to recruit a business.  
 
For these reasons, AdvaMed supports LD 757 and we respectfully ask the 
committee to vote in support of the bill.  
 
Sincerely,
