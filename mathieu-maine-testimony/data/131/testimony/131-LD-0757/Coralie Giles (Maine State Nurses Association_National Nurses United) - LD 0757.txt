RE: Testimony in Opposition to LD 757, An Act to Expand Telemonitoring for 
MaineCare Patients 
 
My name is Coralie Giles. I am a registered nurse, President of the Maine State Nurses 
Association, Vice-President of National Nurses United, and a resident of Brewer. I am 
providing testimony today opposing LD 757 on behalf of Maine State Nurses 
Association/National Nurses United (MSNA/NNU), representing more than 4,000 
Maine registered nurses who provide direct patient care at the bedside. 
 
In our view, expanding telemonitoring would endanger patients by: (1) substituting 
telemonitoring for acutely ill patients who should be hospitalized and (2) having 
patients or caregivers operate telemonitoring devices that require clinical education and 
experience to operate correctly.1 For the reasons discussed below, we ask for your “No” 
vote on LD 757. 
 
(1) LD 757 may substitute telemonitoring for hospitalization of acutely ill patients. 
MSNA/NNU is very concerned that telemonitoring will be used for patients that should 
be hospitalized. The new language in Section 1 states that patients eligible for 
telemonitoring “may be hospitalized or admitted or readmitted to an emergency room 
at the discretion of a provider” (page 1, lines 7-8). This implies that the patients are 
acutely ill.  
 
Hospital-at-home programs are endangering patients by shifting acute-level care into 
the home through the use of telemonitoring devices.2 Patients requiring acute-level

comments to the State Board of Nursing, Board of Licensure in Medicine, and Board of Osteopathic Licensure in our 
comments on the proposed rule “Ch. 11, Joint Rule Regarding Telehealth Standards of Practice”.

hospital care who remain in the home are at serious risk of worsening illness or even 
death, while patients treated in a hospital receive regular assessment by nurses and 
doctors.  
 
Moreover, response time is crucial when a patient’s condition deteriorates. For example, 
delays responding to a patient with cardiac arrest lead to higher mortality rates and a 
greater likelihood of brain damage.3 For example, every minute without 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation after cardiac arrest increases the likelihood of death by 7 
to 10 percent.4 Yet patients being telemonitored in the home may wait more than 30 
minutes for an ambulance to arrive in some parts of Maine and, in some cases, far 
longer.5 In contrast, a patient in a fully operational hospital can be treated immediately.  
 
(2) LD 757 requires patients or their caregivers to operate telemonitoring devices that 
require clinical education and experience to operate correctly. 
The bill requires patients or their caregivers to operate telemonitoring devices 
“including, but not limited to, pulse and blood pressure readings” (page 1, line 16). 
Although the language refers only to pulse and blood pressure readings, it would allow 
a wide variety of telemonitoring devices, including devices that measure the electrical 
activity of the heart (ECG), heart rate variability, blood oxygen levels, respiratory rate, 
and more.  Even devices that measure pulse and blood pressure can result in faulty 
readings when used by lay persons,6 and the other devices are even more challenging 
for those lacking clinical education and experience. 
  
In sum, MSNA/NNU has deep concerns about providing acute-level hospital care in the 
home as well as burdening patients and their families with telemonitoring devices that
