Good Afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and distinguished members of 
the Joint Standing Committee of Health and Human Services. 
I am Kathy Javner, Representative of District 29. I am here today to present LD 449, 
which is a Department bill. This bill seeks to establish licensing requirements for certain 
services related to the Intellectual Disability population. 
The Department held a stakeholder meeting in December outlining their goal with this 
A 
bill. This meeting was well attended andpthe premises behind this bill were positively 
received. 
Along with an outline for licensing, this bill Will allow the Department to update the 
deﬁnition of "autism" that more aligns with how it is utilized today. 
I am humbled to be presenting this bill before you today and look forward to a continued 
collaborative work effort moving forward. 
tea/W Kathy I. Javner 
State Representative Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
House District 29
