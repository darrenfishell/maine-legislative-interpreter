In Opposition to  
 
LD 1680 - An Act to Allow Cannabis Advertising and to Allow Cannabis Delivery  
 
April 24, 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, and I am providing testimony in opposition to  LD 1 680 on behalf 
of the Maine Municipal Association’s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legisla tive Policy Committee (LPC). For 
reference , the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills 
of municipal interest.    
Municipal officials recognize the increased availability of cannabis products but remain steadfast 
in their desire for local control. From the time the Cannabis Legalization Act was passed, local leaders have 
worked tirelessly to adopt and perfect ordinances relating to cannabis establishments in communities that have opted in to allow their operation. The point being their residents have opted to allow these 
businesses to operate.  
Although municipalities are not supportive of cannabis advertising, they are not as strongly 
opposed to advertising as they are the delivery service. L ocal le aders support an individual’s right to 
possess, consume or cultivate adult use cannabis on their personal property, however, they remain 
staunchly opposed to allowing outside delivery service within their borders and urge the committee to 
vote ought not to  pass on LD 1680.  
Thank  you for your time and considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
