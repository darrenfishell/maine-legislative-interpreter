 
 
Testimony of Maine Press Association 
 
In favor of LD 1680, An Act to Allow Cannabis Advertising and to Allow Cannabis Delivery 
 
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
 
Sen. Hickman, Rep. Supica and members of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, my name is Joseph 
Charpentier and I represent the Maine Press Association, a collective of Maine newsprint and digital 
news organizations. 
We believe cannabis should receive the same treatment for advertising purposes as alcohol and 
tobacco. Laws and guidelines for recreational drug advertising have been in place, and morphed from 
time to time, for several decades. 
Only a few years after legalizing cannabis, the industry has already outpaced those of blueberries, maple 
syrup products and potatoes— all staples of this great state’s economy. Granting businesses of any 
nature the right to advertise their products responsibly is a step in the right direction for supporting the 
local economy. 
While we urge the Committee to advance LD 1680, we also wish to neither endorse nor oppose 
provisions for cannabis delivery. 
Thank you.
