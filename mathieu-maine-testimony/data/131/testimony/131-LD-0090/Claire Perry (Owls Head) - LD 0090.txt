AGAINST LD 90
The need for this bill completely eludes me, let alone deeming it to be an emergency.  
Maybe somebody can make sense of it at the work session...because I am totally 
confused as to the need, or the function...other than allowing another person to tag a 
deer on a license you bought for yourself as a hunter.  Not a good thing to start up.
