An Act to Allow Persons 70 Years of Age or Older to Use a Subpermittee to Harvest Deer
February 6, 2023
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and members of the committee, my name is James Cote 
and I am here today on behalf of the Maine Professional Guides Association in opposition to LD 90. 
The Maine Professional Guides Association is particularly concerned with the section of the legislation 
dealing with the subpermittee’s bag limit. It reads:
“4. Subpermittee bag limit. The hunting or killing of deer pursuant to this section by a subpermittee does 
not count toward the subpermittee’s bag limit pursuant to section 11501.”
Allowing a subpermittee a virtually unlimited bag limit on deer under the veil that they are doing so for 
older hunters causes a number of concerns, not the least of which is the harvest pressure that could be 
added onto northern, eastern, and western Maine deer populations. Given the intensive work that 
numerous stakeholders are undergoing to maintain and grow the deer population in these areas of the 
state, we feel that LD 90 introduces an unnecessary management variable. 
We are sensitive to the desires of older hunters who want to harvest a deer as a source of food, but feel 
that there are ample existing opportunities and programs available that help do just that. 
For these reasons, we would urge the committee to vote ought not to pass. Thank you for your 
consideration.
