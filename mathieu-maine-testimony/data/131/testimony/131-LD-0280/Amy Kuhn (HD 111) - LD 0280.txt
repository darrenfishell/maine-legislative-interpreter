    Testimony of Rep. Amy Kuhn in support of  
LD 280, An Act to Make Maine Schools Safer and Healthier by 
Increasing the Maximum Debt Service Limit  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs  
 
Good  afternoon, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and esteemed members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. My name is Amy Kuhn and I represent House 
District 111, which is most of Falmouth. I regret that a committee conflict keeps me from 
testifying in person today, but I am pleased to submit these brief written comments in support of 
LD 280, An Act to Make Maine Schools Safer and Healthier by Increasing the Maximum 
Debt Service Limit.  
Currently, many Maine schools are in use well beyond t heir expected 40 -50 year lifespan  and 
require critical repairs. By increasing the maximum debt service limit for projects, school s will 
be able to remedy this by implementing important safety and health upgrades that will help to 
keep our students safe and comfortable in school. Investing in upgrades to our facilities is crucial 
in making sure the next generation of Mainers are educ ated and ready to contribute positively to 
our state.   
With the next rating cycle anticipated  for 2024, let us make sure we are prepared by increasing 
the maximum debt limit so we can targ et as many schools as possible for critical improvements.  
Thank you for your consideration.
