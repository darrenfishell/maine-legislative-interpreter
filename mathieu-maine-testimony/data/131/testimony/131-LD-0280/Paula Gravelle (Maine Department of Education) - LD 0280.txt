Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committees: 
LD 280, An Act to Make Maine Schools Safer and Healthier by Increasing the Maximum Debt 
Service Limit proposes to change the maximum debt service limit for school capital 
improvements to $250,000,000 for ﬁscal years 2024-2027. The current debt service limit is 
$150,000,000. Title 20-A, §l5905 states that every other year the Commissioner shall 
recommend to the Legislature, and the Legislature shall establish a maximum debt service limit 
for the next two biennia. 
The current maximum debt service limit for major school construction projects in FY 24 is 
$150,000,000. Current bonded debt includes $98,916,606, with $48,108,394 remaining. The 
current approved projects from the 2018 priority list include additional bonding for seven new 
projects which will require funding for bonds up to approximately $500,000,000 over the next 20 
years. Given the requirements of new projects prior to final funding approval and bonding, it is 
unlikely that additional projects over and above those already approved for bonding over the next 
few years would be able to be ready for bonding within the timeframe of this proposal, i.e., ﬁscal 
years 2024-2027. 
This bill will have a ﬁscal impact on General Purpose Aid (GPA) to schools and the Department 
of Education (DOE). The additional cost of this increase to the maximum debt service limit will 
result in an increase to the total cost of education statewide, which will then reduce the amount 
of funds available for other costs of education, unless additional funds are allocated for this 
purpose, as well as increase both the state share of 55%, and the local share of 45% for all school 
administrative units across the State. If school construction projects were approved up to the new 
proposed Debt Service Limit, additional stafﬁng would be required to manage the additional 
projects. The DOE estimates that as many as three new public service coordinator positions 
would be required to manage the additional projects. 
The average age of Maine’s school buildings is approximately 60 years. There are 58 projects 
awaiting funding in the Major Capital Construction Program. Additionally, there have been sharp

increases in construction costs which limits the number of projects that can be completed. School 
Construction has seen signiﬁcant increases in cost of materials over that past several years. 
Information provided by the Associated General Contractors (AGC) indicates that material costs 
increased by nearly 20% over the past two years. 
The Department will be available to provide additional information on LD 280 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work session.
