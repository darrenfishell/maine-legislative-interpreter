Thank you for accepting my testimony.  I am strongly against increasing the debt 
service limit for Maine Schools.  As a former teacher and a former and current school 
board member, I see no reason to increase our debt limits thereby increasing the 
"hidden" tax of inflation on our citizens.   With proper planning and management, 
there is no reason to incur any debt.
