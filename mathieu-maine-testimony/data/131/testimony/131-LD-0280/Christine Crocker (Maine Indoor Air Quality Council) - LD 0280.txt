Maine Indoo r Air Quality Council Testimony  in Support of LD 280:  An Act to Make Schools Safer & 
Healthier by Increasing the Maximum Debt Service Limit.  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council (“MIAQC” or the “Council” ) is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization  
dedicated to creating healthy, productive and environmentally sustainable  indoor environments in 
Maine.  Our efforts focus on the development of education , communications, and  advocacy for safe and 
healthy indoor environments where Maine citizens live, work, play and learn.  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs:  
 
If nothing else, the COVID -19 glo bal pandemic has raised awareness of indoor air quality . We now 
understand there are things in the air we can’ t see, smell or taste , yet they can still  make us sick.  And 
we know that  the primary tool in the building management toolbox to reduce the risk of exposure to 
airborne pollutants is mechanical ventilation.  There are many studies that clearly show how improved 
ventilation not only reduces the risk of exposure to airborne pollutants, it also improves student and 
staff productivity and performance  and reduces absenteeism for all . 
 
Maine has a large number of schools that were constructed before the development of minimum 
acceptable ventilation standards, and we know there are a large number of Maine schools that have no 
mechanical ventilation systems  at all.  For this reason, the Council supports any and all efforts to 
improve school environments through both the construction of new facilities as well as retrofitting 
existing facilities for mechanical ventilation a nd other indoor environment improveme nts.  Raising the 
debt service limit to facilitate funding of construction projects is a great first step.  
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council can be available for the work session to answer any questions or 
provide further comment.
