 RE:  Testimony  in Opposition  of LD 175  – An  Act to Increase the  Use of Municipal  
Waste -to-energy  Processes as  a Source of  Renewable  Energy  
 Senator  Lawrence, Representative  Zeigler,  and members of  the Energy, Utilities  and Technology 
Committee:  
 Thank you for  the opportunity to submit testimony  on LD  175, an  Act to Increase the  Use of  
Municipal  Waste -to-energy  Processes as a  Source  of Renewable Energy.  Conservation Law  
Foundation (“
CLF”)  opposes  this bill.  
 CLF is a member- supported nonprofit  organization  working to  conserve  natural  resources,  
protect  public  health, and  build healthy  communities  in Maine  and throughout  New E ngland. 
Through its  Zero  Waste Project,  CLF  aims  to improve  waste diversion and  recycling  programs  
and protect  communities  and our  environment  from  the dangers  of unsustainable  waste 
management  practices and pollution from  landfills,  waste incinerators,  and other  high- heat waste  
processing.  
 
LD 175 would  amend  Maine ’s solid  waste management  hierarchy  to add the incineration  of 
waste to  generate electricity  to the State ’s solid  waste management  prioritie s. The amendment  
would prioritize  incineration  for gene rating  electricit y as a form  of “reuse of waste”,  preferable  
even  to recycling.
1 This  bill would also amend  existing  renewable  resource law to expand the  
definition  of “renewable capacity  resource”  to include  the burning of  municipal solid  waste for  
electr ical generation.  
 
Incineration  harms  local  communities  and the  environment;  it should remain  at the bottom  of the 
solid  waste management  hierarchy, and  it should not be considered a  “renewable capaci ty 
resource” because mun icipal solid  waste  is comprised  of non- renewable resources.  
 
I. Incinerators do  not produce  renewable energy .  
 
Incineration,  often  referred  to as “waste- to-energy”  by the  industry, is  a high -heat waste   
 
1 38 M.R.S.A.  § 2101

treatment technology that  involves  burning municipal  solid  waste (“MSW”),  a.k.a. the 
combination  of commercial,  residential,  and industrial wastes.  High -heat incineration  converts  
these materials  into bottom  ash, fly ash, combustion gases,  air pollutants,  wastewater,  wastewater  
treatment  sludge, and heat.   
 
Muni cipal  Solid  Waste comprises  many  materials  that are not “renewable.” Incineration  of MSW  
that contains  fossil  fuels,  such as plastics and rubber, releases the  bound carbon stored  in those  
fossil  fuels.
2 According to  the U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency (“EPA”),  in 2020, MSW  
incineration released  more  than 11.0 million  metric  tons  of carbon dioxide  equivalent  (“CO2e”)  
greenhouse  gases.3 Per unit of electricity  generated,  waste incineration  emits  more  carbon 
dioxide  (2,988 lbs/MWh)  than coal -fired  power  plants  (2,249 lbs/MWh).4 
 
Moreover, according to the EPA,  zero  waste practices  such  as source  reduction, recycling, and 
composting provide  a significant  net life-cycle  reduction in greenhouse  gas emissi ons compared  
to incineration.5 Zero waste  practices  conserve  significantly  more  energy than can  be generated  
via incineration.6 Source  reduction, recycling, and composting  can conserve  three  to five times  
more  energy,  per ton of  waste,  than can be genera ted by incinerating  that same ton of  waste.7 
 
II. Incinerators’  toxic  emissions and ash  are bad for  the environment , public  health,  
and the  economy.  
Waste incineration  not only  emits  climate -altering  greenhouse  gases,  but it also  releases 
significant  levels of  toxic  pollutants  harming communities.  On average,  to produce  the same 
amount  of energy as a  coal power  plant, waste incinerators release:

primarily  because of the high content  of non-biomass  carbon  in plastics.”) .

• 28 times  as much dioxin;  
• Twice  as much  carbon monoxide;  
• Three  times  as many nitrogen oxides;  
• 6–14 times  as much mercury;  
• Nearly  six times  as much  lead;  and, 
• 70% more  sulfur  dioxides.8 
 
Incinerators  are also  significant  sources of  particulate matter emissi ons.9 Inhalation  of particulate  
matter  has been  linked  to respiratory  and cardiovascular  problems  and may  cause approximately  
2 million  excess deaths  worldwide  each  year.10 A 2011 study published in the American  
Economic  Review  found that among U.S. industries, waste incineration  has the highest  ratio  of 
negative  economic  impacts  from  air pollution compared  to the financial value  added by  the 
industry.11 
 
3. Incineration  is not a solid  waste  management  solution .  
 Incineration  is often  touted  as a landfill alternative,  but after  incineration, roughly 25%  of the 
weight  of incoming  waste  remains in the form  of residual  ash that must  be landfilled.
12 This  ash 
contains  high  levels of  dioxin, mercury,  lead,  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (“PCBs ”) and 
polychlorinated  naphthalens  (“PCNs”) .13 When  incinerator  ash is deposited in  landfills,  these 
pollutants  eventually leach  out and pose a threat  to groundwater, drinking  water,  and surface  
water  bodies , also  impacting  wildlife  habitat .14

   Incineration  is not the  solution to  waste  management  in Maine.  Incineration,  regardless  of its  use, 
should not be  a solid  waste management priority-- as the current  Solid  Waste Hierarchy  correctly  
reflects.
15 It is equally alarmin g to consider  designating the burning of trash  as a renewable 
resource,  given that is not renewable,  and is  very  harmful to  communities  and to  the 
environment.    Maine must promote sensible,  proven, and effective policies that  increase  waste diversion and 
bolster true  recycling , while  preserving  the definition  of renewable capacity  resource as  those 
sources that rely on wind  or solar  generation . An RPS  policy must support generation of 
renewable resources that will ensure Maine meets its  climate  targets  to address the  climate  crisis,  
not incentivize harmful and greenhouse gas intensive  practices.  To decarbonize the  region, CLF  
has long focused on reducing reliance  on fossil  fuels.  Reducing emissions  from the waste sector  
is critical  through zero  waste strat egies.  These strategies include banning unrecyclable plastics,  
improving  organic waste diversion through composting and anaerobic digestion, and improving 
recycling  and reuse through  Maine’s  landmark  program for  extended producer responsibility  for 
packaging. Through a combination of these laws,  policies , and  enforcement, we  can implement 
the zero  waste  alternatives that  will significantly  reduce our  waste and the  need  for incineration.   
 For 
all these  reasons,  CLF  urges the committee  to oppose this  bill. Thank you for the opportunity 
to submit this  testimony.
