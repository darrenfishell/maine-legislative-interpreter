Senator Lawrence , Representative Zeigler , and members of the Committee, I am 
Susanne Miller, Director of the Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management at the 
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) , speaking in opposition to  L.D. 175. 
 
This bill, in part, proposes to amend the solid waste management hierarchy outlined in 
38 M.R.S. §2101  to elevate the incineration of waste to generate electricity to a level 
(LD# 175, An Act To Increase The Use Of Municipal Waste -To-Energy Processes As A Source 
Of Renewable Energy )

higher on the hi erarchy  than its current solid waste management priority . It is the current 
policy of the state to plan for , and implement , an integrated approach to solid waste 
management for solid waste generated in or imported into the state, according to the 
following  order of priority : reduc tion, reuse , recycl ing, compost ing, waste processing 
including incineration, and land disposal.  The ultimate goal of the hierarchy is to reduce 
the need for  solid waste to be disposed which is why reduction is at the highest rung 
with reuse following immediately after .   
 
Currently, Maine’s Solid Waste Management Statute 38 M.R.S. §2101  identifies 
incineration as a method of  waste  processing that reduces the volume of waste needing 
land disposal. For this reason,  the Department supports incineration over landfilling and 
has ranked incineration higher on the waste management hierarchy  than landfilling . The 
DEP strongly believes that incineration plays an important role in the management of 
solid waste in Maine. However, it is important to note that waste residues are still 
generated as a result of the incineration process , albeit at a much lower volume, and 
must still be managed.  In addition, incineration relies upon the generation of wastes as 
a business model  in order to function.  This is very different than  the incentives inherent 
in the highest  two rungs of Maine’s waste hierarchy, reduction  and reuse, which both 
aim to generate less waste  from the start.  Moving incineration up to the same level in 
the waste hierarchy as reuse would not serve the state’s en d goal to reduce the need 
for disposal.  
 
To encourage adherence to the waste hierarchy  in 38 M.R.S. §2101 , DEP continues to 
implement and evaluate initiatives  to ensure solid waste is managed  responsibly while 
also promoting it s remaining value.   Many of M aine DEP’s programs  focus on providing 
methods and tools to reduce overall waste requiring disposal. These include  providing 
state funds to local and regional  waste management facilities  to divert solid waste from 
disposal , implementing an extended producer responsibility program for packaging,

Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony.  I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
