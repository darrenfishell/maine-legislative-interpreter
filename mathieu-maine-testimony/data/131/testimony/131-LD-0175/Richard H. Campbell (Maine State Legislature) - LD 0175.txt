Good afternoon, Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and distinguished members

As the time for me to submit a leave to withdraw request has come and gone, and 
since lno longer wish to pursue the passage of this bill, I respectfully ask you to send 
this measure to the House floor with a unanimous ought not to pass report. 
Thank you for your time.
