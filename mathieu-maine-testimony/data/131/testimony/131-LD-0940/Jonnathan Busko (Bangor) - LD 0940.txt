Tes$mony of Dr. Jonnathan Busko, MD, MPH  a Resident of Bangor, Maine, in support of LD 940, An Act To Allow Pharmacists To Provide Services Through Telehealth and Vending Machines at Federally Qualiﬁed Health Centers  March 14, 2023  Dear Chair Perry, Chair Bailey, and members of the CommiQee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services,   I’m Jonnathan Busko, an emergency physician in Bangor.  I’ve come before this commiQee in the past to support bills that address rural health care access.  I am the designer of and medical director for the “Jackman Cri$cal Access Physician Extender Project,” a demonstra$on project using telehealth and advanced prac$ce paramedics to assure that Moose River Valley residents have 24-hour a day access to urgent and emergency care services, and have been involved in a number of other health care service access projects over the years in Maine’s rural and fron$er communi$es.   Timely access to all aspects of healthcare, including pharmacy services such as prescrip$on and over the counter medica$ons, is oZen diﬃcult in Maine communi$es due to travel distances and transporta$on challenges.  In the era of prescrip$on mail delivery, many pa$ents are now able to access their long-term medica$ons in a reasonably convenient and reliable way.  However, acute medica$ons such as an$bio$cs, pain relievers, long-term medica$ons being started for new diagnoses, and many others can be much more diﬃcult to access due to distance and $ming of pharmacy hours.  These barriers lead  to delays in star$ng poten$ally life-saving therapies.  We see this regularly in Jackman, par$cularly for the Thursday evening through Monday morning stretch when the Community Health Center is closed for rou$ne medical services.   While some small Maine communi$es have local pharmacies, many others do not, and the nearest pharmacy may be an hour or more away.  Furthermore, with the excep$on of the greater Portland area and south, Maine communi$es do not have access to 24-hour a day pharmacies.  While this may not maQer in many cases, any pa$ent seen in an emergency department north of Portland aZer 7 pm is unlikely to be able to ﬁll a prescrip$on before 9 am the following morning. This has led to convoluted paQerns of hospital dispensing that are not op$mal for pa$ents or hospitals.   It is with this in mind that I support LD 940 but would ask that the commiQee consider including loca$ons of service above and beyond Federally Qualiﬁed Health Centers.  The Maine Pharmacy Board regula$ons already allow non-retail dispensing of medica$ons from vending-type machines in nursing and correc$onal facili$es by a limited group of appropriately trained individuals under the supervision of a remote pharmacist.  To improve community access, locally manned retail tele-pharmacy services could be safely performed in a number of medical sites including skilled nursing facili$es, nursing homes, emergency departments, rural health 
clinics, and EMS sta$ons.  The Maine Board of Pharmacy has comprehensive rules on the opera$onal and infrastructure requirements for such dispensing units.  By iden$fying a list of medically appropriate sites staﬀed by qualiﬁed non-pharmacist personnel that could house such units and opera$ons, communi$es would be given the opportunity to make the commitment necessary to assure $mely local access to prescrip$on medica$ons (and non-prescrip$on medica$ons, as such manned vending units are capable of dispensing both).  In essence, through agreements with pharmacists, training, and infrastructure, personnel at the vending machine sites would essen$ally act as pharmacy technicians for the remote pharmacisits.   In summary, I believe that LD 940 as wriQen has the poten$al to expand Mainers’ access to retail pharmacy services and prescrip$ons.  However, limi$ng it to only one type of medical site, federally qualiﬁed health centers, would miss a signiﬁcant opportunity to more widely expand safe access to retail pharmacy services through a number of medical venues, all under the supervision and strong regulatory processes of the Maine Board of Pharmacy.  Sincerely,  Jonnathan Busko MD, MPH
