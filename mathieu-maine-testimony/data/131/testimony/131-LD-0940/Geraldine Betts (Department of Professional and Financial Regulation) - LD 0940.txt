REGULATION 
IN OPPOSITION OF L.D. 940 
“An Act to Allow Pharmacists to Provide Services Through T elekealth and Vending 
Machines at Federally Qualified Health Centers” 
Sponsored by Representative Anne C. Perry 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
HEALTH COVERAGE, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Public Hearing: March 21, 2023, 1:00 PM 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Committee, my name is Jeri 
Betts and I am a Regulatory Board Manager with the Ofﬁce of Professional and Occupational 
Regulation (OPOR.) I am the Board Manager for the Board of Pharmacy, ﬁve other allied health 
boards and one licensing program. I am here to speak in opposition to LD 940 on behalf of 
OPOR. 
This bill proposes to allow pharmacists licensed out-of-state to provide telehealth services fora 
patient of a federally qualiﬁed health center (“FQHC”) in Maine. It is our understanding that 
there are approximately 144 Federally Qualiﬁed Health Centers located broadly across the State 
of Maine. Allowing a pharmacist to practice in Maine without a Maine license (by telehealth or 
in person) deprives the Maine Board of Pharmacy of regulatory oversight over that out-of-state 
pharmacist and deprives a Maine citizen of the ability to ﬁle a complaint against that provider 
with the Maine Board of Pharmacy. 
A pharmacist licensed in good standing in another state can apply for a Maine license through a 
fast-track procedure called “licensure by endorsement. ” This fast-track process was established 
by P.L. 2021 c. 642 which took effect on August 8, 2022. Public law 642 directed the Board to 
establish a process to issue a license by endorsement to an applicant Who has an out of state license 
from a jurisdiction which maintains substantially equivalent license requirements to Maine 
requirements. As a side note, the legislation establishing licensure by endorsement was initiated 
by OPOR and DPFR.

Testimony of Jeri Betts, DPFR/OPOR

The portion of this bill that provides that a Maine licensed pharmacist may provide “telehealth 
services for a patient of a federally qualiﬁed health center” in Maine, including by means ofa 
“pharmaceutical vending machine” located at a F QHC, is already permitted under the Board’s 
law and rules. Although the bill uses the terminology “pharmaceutical vending machine, ” it is 
likely this is referring to “automated pharmacy systems” as that term is used in Maine. Automated 
pharmacy systems may be in a retail phannacy, or as contemplated by the bill, an institutional 
pharmacy such as a FQHC. 
Chapter 20, subchapter 2 of Board rules currently provides that a “[a]n automated phannacy 
system may dispense drugs at one or more point of care locations remote from the pharmacist in 
charge of the system or the pharmacist on duty. The pharmacist in charge and pharmacist on duty 
need not be physically present at the point of care location and need not be located within the 
State. However, such pharmacists must be licensed in Maine and must be in good standing 
with the board.” (emphasis added.) Furthermore, Maine law 1P.L. 2021, c. 2913 already 
authorizes telehealth services to be provided by several categories of Maine health care licensees, 
including pharmacists. 
In speaking with the proponent of this bill, the bill may not have been drafted as they intended 
both with respect to Maine licensure and automatic dispensing machines. We are meeting with 
the proponent to see if the current law satisﬁes their needs or, if not, to discuss what further 
objectives they are seeking to accomplish. 
Thank you for your time, and I will be happy to answer your questions now or at the work session.
