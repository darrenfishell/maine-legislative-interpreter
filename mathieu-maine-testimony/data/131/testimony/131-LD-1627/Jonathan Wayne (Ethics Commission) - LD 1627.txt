Re: L.D. 1627 -  Contents of Monthly Lobbyist Reports  
 
 For your reference, I have attached a sample of five monthly lobbyist reports filed wit h 
the Ethics Commission for the month of March 2023.  
Commonly Reported Information 
In the monthly reports , lobbyist s are required  to disclose certain types of information.  3 
M.R.S. § 317(1).  Reports are filed on the 15th day of the month and cover the previous calendar 
month.  The  reports are client- specific.  A lobbyist that is registered for ten client s will file  ten 
reports for the month.  T he information most common ly listed in monthly reports includes : 
• contact information for the lobbyist and client, and a list of any lo bbyist associate s 
working with the l obbyist , 
• total compensation t hat the lobbyist and associates expect  to receive for lobbying during 
the month, divided by the different bra nches of government lobbied (the legislative 
branch, executive branch , and constitutional officers ), 
• a list of the bills , issue s, or other legislative action s that w ere the subject of lobbying 
during the month, 
• a list of any bills  or action s for which the lobbyist /associates  expect  to be compensated  
more than $1,000 during the month, including the amount compensated f or that 
bill/action , and  
• the total cost, if $250 or more, paid by the client or lobbyist for officials and immediate 
family members to attend an  event , along with the date and a descript ion of the event  and 
a list of officials/family members who attended.  
 
2 
 Other R equired Informa tion 
Other financial activity must be r eported but it occurs less freq uently:  
• total e xpenditures made by the lobbyist for purposes of lobbying for which the lobbyist 
expects to be reimbursed , separated by branch of government , 
• total e xpenditures made by the lobbyist and client directly  to, or on behalf of , a covered 
official  or member of the  official ’s immediate family  (e.g., meal s or travel ); each 
expenditure of $25 or more must be  itemized  by date, amount, purpose , and  name of 
official/family member , 
• grassroots lobbying expense s exceed ing $2,000 in the month on communications to 
members of the public soliciting them to contact officials  to influence legislative  action,  
and 
• the name of any original source  that has paid $1,000 or more to the client for  purpose s of 
lobbying or grassroots  lobbying, including the name of the original source and amount.   
 
Record -Keeping  
In order to disclose the above information , it is necessary for a lobbyist or administrative 
assistant to keep records of the  lobbyist ’s activities during the month .  For lobbyist s with several 
clients, this can require keeping track of a large amount of detail , for e xample , which bills were 
lobbied on behalf of each client .  Lobbyists are required to disclose the amount compens ated for 
any particular bill , if greater than $1,000.  Practically, this require s a lobbyist or administrative 
assistant to calculate the value of the lo bbyist ’s work  dedicated to each particular bil l.  The 
Commission staff cannot verify that e very lobbyist keeps this kind of record, but it would seem  
to be pract ically necessary to disclose the compensation  earned per bill, if g reater than $1,000.
