LD 1190
I would like to reach out to you to discuss LD 1190.  This bill, as well-intentioned as 
it is, would destroy hospitality businesses.  We aim, and work towards, scheduling out
as far as possible.  But with each day bringing new challenges, and ever-evolving 
clientele.  In tourism driven markets - weather plays a huge factor that does not 
always cooperate with our intentions.  We are constantly changing our schedule, and 
must do so.  We communicate well with our employees, by spending a lot of time and
money on a scheudling platform that shows them their schedule, any changes, how 
much money they made at the end of each shifts, and so on.  This bill seems to be a 
solution that does not solve a problem.  There is no need to punish employers who 
already do the right thing. Please consider the consequences to such burdensome 
regulation on already stretched management teams, as well.  Thank you!
