In Opposition to 
LD 1190 – An Act to Ensure a Fair Workweek by Requiring Notice of Work Schedules 
April 6, 2023 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Labor Committee, my name is Jeffrey 
Austin and this testimony is offered in opposition to LD 1190 on behalf of the Maine Hospital 
Association.  The Maine Hospital Association (MHA) represents all 36 community-governed 
hospitals including 33 non-profit general acute care hospitals, 2 private psychiatric hospitals, and 
1 acute rehabilitation hospital.   
Approximately 5 hospitals are below the 250-employee threshold; all others would be covered by 
this legislation. 
We appreciate that workers would like to know their work schedule with as much advanced notice 
as possible. 
Hospitals operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  Maintaining appropriate staffing for every 
hour of every day is a monumental challenge.  In fact, it’s nearly impossible. 
This committee asks employers like hospitals to accept flexibility from our employees when they 
can’t make it to work.  As has been said many times in this committee, “life happens.”  People get 
sick, family members get sick, cars get flat tires and so on.  Frequently, employees who are asked 
to adjust their schedules are doing so due to the short notice given by another employee that they 
can’t come to work.  Life does happen. 
Furthermore, changes in patient volume and acuity can change relatively quickly and certainly in 
less than two weeks’ time. 
Regulations that can’t be adhered to with regularity aren’t regulations, they are penalties. It does 
not appear that hospitals could always comply with the standards in the bill, and they would simply 
have to pay fines.  We ask that this bill not go forward. 
Thank you for accepting our testimony.
