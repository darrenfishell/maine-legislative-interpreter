Bar Harbor 
LD 1190
Good morning, as a seasonal restaurant owner in Bar Harbor Maine operating for 
separate locations I am writing With strong opposition to LD1190. Our schedules are 
currently posted weekly. Every. Single. Day. The schedule changes for one reason or 
the other. Someone might call out sick, someone might just not show up, someone 
might have a family illness and need to leave early, there are 1 million reasons why 
the schedule changes. It would be completely ludicrous to think any restaurant in the 
state of Maine could operate without changing their schedule. This would result in 
closure because we would not have any employees if we were not allowed to change 
the schedule after the fact. This would devastate us financially and if in place we 
would have to implement an entire new HR department to oversee. This is financially 
impossible and would result in us closing our doors forever. Please don’t try to fix 
some thing that isn’t broken. We happily give people paid time off we happily give 
people five sick days per six months of work, there is absolutely no reason they need 
to have a law in place saying we cannot change her schedule at the last minute for 
emergency reasons. I implore you to throw this lot out as fast as possible
