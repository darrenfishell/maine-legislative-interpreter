Dear Honorable Legislators,
I am a licensed healthcare Administrator in Maine.  I have worked in a number of 
long-term care facilities in Maine since 2005 and have been witness to a shrinking 
healthcare workforce.  Covid-19 came along and the challenge to maintain a 
consistent business environment with a stable support staff are hopefully at its’ apex. I
say hopefully due to the concern if it becomes worse that it will impact the effective 
running of a business more than ever.
The healthcare end of labor aside, there is the Administrative end as well.  Maine Bill 
L.D. 131-S.P. 486 stands to further hinder and potentially cripple the effectiveness of 
overseeing the business of caring for constituents-residents, patients, customers-while 
increasing the minutia a Human Resources Assistant or Staff Scheduler (for example) 
has to track and report.  We rely on our workers to show up to work as scheduled.  
We already pay overtime, extra shift bonuses, and offer a bevy of benefits as one may
choose.
 
Maine Bill L.D. 131-S.P. 486 would serve to penalize employers already engaged in 
previously unseen levels of frustration and challenge with getting people to come to 
work as they are scheduled.  It is a unionized approach that will set businesses up for 
failure.  Operators will ask if more oversight is worth continuing; haven’t we seen 
enough businesses close in Maine already?
Thank you for your time.
Respectfully submitted,
Carl Chadwick
