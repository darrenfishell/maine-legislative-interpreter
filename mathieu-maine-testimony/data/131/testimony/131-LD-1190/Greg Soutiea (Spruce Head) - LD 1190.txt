This bill would make hospitality scheduling very difficult for restaurant and hotel 
owners. The flexibility with our staff and our ever changing needs are in part what 
make the business work best. Passing this would pose undue burden on hospitality 
businesses that are the heart of Maine's tourism industry. 
The state should not impose financial penalties for changes to employees' schedules. 
Our businesses already operate on thin margins. Now is not the time to consider 
adding to the stack of potential financial violations already on the books.
