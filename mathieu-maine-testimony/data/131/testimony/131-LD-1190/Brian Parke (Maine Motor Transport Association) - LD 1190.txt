TESTIMONY OF MM“! um” Brian Parke 1-gmggggm EL 
L.D. 1190, “An Act to Ensure a Fair Aﬁﬂtiilfiﬂil 
Workweek by Requiring Notice of Work ,,,,_,m;m, ‘
} Schedu|es ” (397)333-4133 
Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on 
Labor and Housing. My name is Brian Parke and l am the President and CEO of the Maine 
Motor Transport Association and a resident of Brunswick. The Association is comprised of 
more than 1,700 member companies, whose employees make up a large portion of the 
34,000 people who make their living in the trucking industry in Maine. 
l am here today to testify in opposition to LD 1190 because, quite frankly, the trucking 
industry is always adjusting schedules. Whether it is shipper requirements that change, 
receiver requirements that get adjusted or schedule changes due to equipment breakdowns 
or weather events — our professionals working in the trucking industry know there is no typical 
day in trucking. 
instead of a 9-5 standard schedule, truckers need to react to logistical challenges to safely 
deliver the freight America requires. implementing LD 1190 would only complicate the supply 
chain and make it less efficient. As is designed, truckers work all over the state, the region 
and the country. We operate at all hours of the day and night to deliver goods and as 
proposed, this bill would be illogical to implement for trucking companies or for any company 
that needs to react to customer and other external demands beyond the control of the 
employer. 
We respectfully ask that you oppose LD 1190. 
Thank you for your consideration and for allowing me to testify. l would be happy to answer 
any questions the committee has now or at the Work Session.
