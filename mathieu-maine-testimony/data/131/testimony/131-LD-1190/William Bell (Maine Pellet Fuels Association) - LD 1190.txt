Re: LD 1190 An Act to Ensure a Fair Workweek by Requiring Notice of Work Schedules 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Members of the Committee on Labor and Housing: 
 
Our Maine Pellet Fuels Association is a standard trade association consisting of Maine’s four 
pellet manufacturing firms, located in Ashland, Athens, Strong, and Sanford; a pellet boiler 
manufacturing firm located in Bethel; heating system installers; industry suppliers, and several 
non-profit organizations.  
 
While the legislation as presented would not affect our membership, the largest of whom has 
approximately 100 employees, our members are adamantly opposed to the very concept of the 
bill, which we believe to be a Bad Solution in Search of a Problem.  
 
Good employees are a highly valued asset, particularly in rural Maine. Every effort is made to 
accommodate employees. For instance, one large firm in our Association has a “Help Out” group 
of employees, who make themselves available to fill in for other employees who may have an 
unexpected obstacle to working their normal shift.  
 
At the same time, our members go out of their way to keep employees working at other jobs, 
such as maintenance, during times of year (Mud Season!) when harvesting of wood is 
diminished or demand for wood pellets is slack.  
 
We believe that the extensive regulation implicit in the proposed LD 1190 runs counter to the 
concern which Maine employers have for their employees and should be resoundingly voted 
Ought Not To Pass.
