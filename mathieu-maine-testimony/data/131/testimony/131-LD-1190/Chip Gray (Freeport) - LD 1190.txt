LD 1190
LD 1190 is an unworkable bill.  The Hospitality business is affected by many short 
term factors, weather alone makes accurately predicting business levels impossible. 
Attempting to lock in a two week out schedule by penalizing changes hurts both the 
business and the employee.  One of the benefits of those changes would include being
offered a chance to come in and work a rainy day lunch crowd and walk out with a 
quick $500. in your pocket. It also allows for the flexibility to get your daughter to the
dentist for emergency treatment. Although every business tries to keep as regular a 
schedule as possible , that sad phone call for a memorial service next week changes 
everything instantly.
Please do not allow this mistake to go forward. We can't legislate our way out of the 
next rain storm or power failure sending half the Town to our establishments for 
dinner.
