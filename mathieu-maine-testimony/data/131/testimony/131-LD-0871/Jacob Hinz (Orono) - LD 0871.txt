Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee, my name is Jacob Hinz, a student at UMaine Orono. Thank you for the opportunity to 
testify in support of L.D. 871, An Act to Provide Support for Maine Discovery Museum&#39;s Informal 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education Throughout the State. 
 
Research has shown that 95% of the population learns about science outside of the classroom. Because 
of this dynamic, Museums like the MDM, this help spur young innovators and keeps our people 
knowledgeable about the world around them. MDM programs like the Maine Invention and Maine 
Science Festival and their outreach programs help rich science content reach rural communities and 
underserved children who usually cannot find such opportunities around them. Think of this program as 
one that can find diamonds in the rough since all students from these underserved communities have 
just as much potential as kids living around Bangor who can regularly visit the museum. State funding 
for the Maine Discovery Museum can only help the students of Maine reach their full potential so they 
can give even more of themselves back to the state in the future. This bill is an investment in our 
children; by funding the MDM through the state, we can help all Maine children have easier access to 
scientific education outside of their classroom and find the love of learning every student needs to have 
a successful future in STEM. As a resident of Maine and a student of UMO, this bill can only help the 
prospects of innovation and scientific achievement in the state of Maine and our universities. So please 
pass LD871 and help the Maine Discovery Museum provide an essential service to our future success. 
 
Sincerely, 
Jacob Hinz
