Testimony of Representative Daniel Newman in support of 
LD 986, An Act to Ensure Safer Communities by Increasing the Punishment for 
Crimes Involving Fentanyl 
Good Afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and esteemed members 
of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. My name is 
Representative Daniel Newman and I represent District 58, which includes Belgrade, 
Rome, Fayette, Mount Vernon, Vienna, and New Sharon. I am here before you today to 
present: 
LD 986, “An Act to Ensure Safer Communities by Increasing the Punishment for 
Crimes Involving Fentanyl ” 
Fentanyl is the most dangerous substance being trafﬁcked at this time. 
According to data provided by the law library, in 2020 F entanyl caused 336 deaths in 
Maine, that’s 67% of all drug deaths in this State which is an increase of 30% from 2019. 
From 2013-2019 deaths from synthetic opioids have increased from 1.0 per 100,000 to 
11.4 per 100,000. If you look at data provided by the Margaret Chase Smith Policy 
Center, that starts at 0% in 2013 it increases to 78% in 2021. 
We keep hearing that the war on drugs was a failed policy, but since we have started to 
decrease penalties and legalize drug possession the amount of trafficking and deaths has 
skyrocketed. 
We know we need to spend more money on treatment, but if we can’t get a handle on the 
amount of drugs coming into the State we will run out of money and at that point we will 
be sending out our overburdened EMS services to transport bodies rather than save lives. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
District 58 Belgrade, Fayette, Mount Vernon, Rome, Vienna & New Sharon
