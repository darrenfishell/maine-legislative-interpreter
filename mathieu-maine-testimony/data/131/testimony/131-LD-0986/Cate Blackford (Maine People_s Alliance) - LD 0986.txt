Good
afternoon
Sen.
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety .
My
name
is
Cate
Blackford
and
I
am
the
Public
Policy
Director
for
the
Maine
People’ s
Alliance.
Our
32,000
members
stretch
from
Kittery
to
Fort
Kent.
We
are
committed
to
creating
a
state
where
everyone
has
what
they
need,
contributes
what
they
can,
and
no
one
is
left
behind.
MPA
is
here
today
to
testify
in
opposition
to
both
LD
986
and
LD
1509.
Both
of
these
bills
prioritize
punishment
over
treatment,
a
strategy
that
has
been
proven
over
and
over
to
fail
to
reduce
substance
use
or
trafficking.
Rather
than
requiring
harsher
punishments,
our
laws
need
to
address
the
opioid
epidemic
as
a
public
health
issue.
Instead
of
criminalization,
we
need
to
embrace
compassion.
Instead
of
relying
on
outdated
policies
that
lock
people
away ,
we
need
to
embrace
smart,
evidence-based
reforms
that
save
lives.
Maine
has
some
of
the
harshest
drug
laws
in
the
country ,
and
those
laws
disproportionately
punish
poor
people
and
people
of
color ,
especially
Black
and
African
American
people.
In
2018,
Black
people
made
up
about
one
percent
of
Maine’ s
population;
but
accounted
for
21
percent
of
Class
A
felony
drug
arrests
and
15
percent
of
Class
B
felony
drug
arrests.
1
Harsh
drug
laws
hurt
children,
too.
Women
–
and
overwhelmingly
mothers
–
bear
the
brunt
of
drug-related
arrests
and
incarceration.
In
Maine,
Department
of
Corrections
data
show
drug
arrests
of
women
increased
25%
between
2008
and
2018. 
2
Harsh
drug
laws
have
a
ripple
effect
on
families
and
communities.
Separating
a
parent
or
family
member
through
incarceration
does
lasting,
irreparable
harm
to
their
loved
ones. 
It’s
also
profoundly
financially
damaging
for
families.
Incarceration
is
associated
with
permanent
declines
in
income
and
the
loss
of
opportunities
including
education
and
employment
for
family
members.

I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
share
the
story
of
one
of
MPA’s
members,
Brandi
Staples
who
lives
in
Phippsburg.
Brandi’ s
cousin
Jason
passed
away
at
the
age
of
36
from
an
overdose.
He
passed
away
8
years
ago
this
year.
He
did
not
live
to
see
all
the
resources
that
we
now
have
today
and
how
we
are
trying
to
make
things
better
for
people
with
substance
use
disorders.
It’s
incredibly
hard
to
describe
what
it’s
like
to
watch
someone
you
grew
up 
with-someone
who
was
so
bright,
funny ,
witty
and
full
of
life
become
someone
so 
shadowed,
a
shell
of
who
they
once
were
and
someone
so
jilted
by
life.
The
only
thing 
to
live
for
was
to
get
high
so
he
could
just
forget
the
hurts
of
life.
Brandi
lost
count
of
how
many
times
he
went
to
jail
or
was
arrested
for
possession
or 
being
high.
It
was
all
so
ridiculous.
He
was
never
offered
rehab,
just
jail.
She
wants
to 
tell
you
from
experience
that
Jail
doesn’t
work,
Jail
is
not
tough
love,
Jail
just
teaches 
you
how
to
be
a
better
criminal,
how
to
hide
it
better ,
it
doesn’t
do
one
thing
to
help
you 
into
recovery .
He
relapsed
and
overdosed
almost
every
single
time
he
was
released.
Brandi
asked
me
to
tell
you
she
finds
these
bills
disheartening.
They
do
not
help
those 
in
our
community
evolve,
instead
they
just
send
us
back
and
hold
us
in
place.
Having
an 
addiction
shouldn’t
be
a
crime.
If
you
needed
help
to
get
better
but
would
be
punished 
with
a
crime
would
you
want
to
get
the
help
you
need?
Thank
you
for
your
time
today
and
all
your
hard
work.
