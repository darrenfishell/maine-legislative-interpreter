LD 986
DEAR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE,
MY name is Cory, AND I LIVE IN Waterville, MAINE. I AM WRITING TODAY in
Support of  LD 986. because if your going to do drugs and be on fentanyl and do 
crime you need to do the time. I believe we need to get these criminals and drugs off 
our streets. The Maine State Police and other town police Deptâ€™s are doing just that. I 
thank them every day for doing what they do. just a few weeks ago The Pittsfield 
Police Dept was called for a suspicious male found out he was charged for unlawful 
Trafficking of Scheduled drugs, Fentanyl along with aggravated criminal mischief 
and hindering prosecution all felony level crimes. so I ask you to support LD- 986
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
