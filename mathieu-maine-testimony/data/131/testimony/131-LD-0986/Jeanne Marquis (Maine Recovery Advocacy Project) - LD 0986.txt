Testimony in Opposition to 
LD986: An Act to Ensure Safer Communities by Increasing the Punishment for Crimes 
Involving Fentanyl 
April 18th, 2023 
Good afternoon, Sponsor Senator Farrin, Committee Chair Senator Beebe-Center, 
Representative Salizbury, and the honorable Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee. I am an organizer for the Maine Recovery Advocacy Project and a parent of 
a person in recovery. I am speaking to you today in opposition to LD966, an act that will 
increase punishment for crimes involving Fentanyl. 
l understand the motivation for this bill; however, this bill will not achieve what you hope 
it would. lt will not lower the amount of fentanyl on the streets, and it will not lower the 
number of overdoses in the state of Maine. 
We are all concerned about how Fentynal has entered the drug supply. Adding an 
increased punishment to the low level trafficker will not stop the supply from coming into 
this country from international sources — that would need to be addressed on the federal 
level. 
The reality is that users on the local level are not always aware that Fentynal is in their 
supply. Our legal deﬁnition for trafﬁcking is based on very low amounts which will entrap 
users who are carrying amounts for personal use. Increasing the punishments toa 
Class A would increase their potential prison time to 30 years, effectively giving them no 
hope of ever recovering from what we now know is a brain disease and not a crime. 
The common understanding is that addiction is an illness, so it makes no sense to treat 
it with a punishment, especially such a harsh punishment as 30 years in prison. For this 
reason, our network is urging the committee to oppose LD986. Thank you for your time 
and consideration.
