LD 986
Dear Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Megan, and I live in China, Maine. I am writing today to ask you to 
oppose LD 986.
Criminalization isn't the solution to creating safer communities. It can happen after 
we've tried EVERYTHING that works first. Do we have enough detox beds- No? Do 
we have enough recovery or community centers? - No? Do we have enough housing? 
No! Do we have enough livable wage jobs? No! We can't just keep punishing people 
with no clear form of rehabilitation. In fact, criminalization makes the rehabilitation 
process so much harder. We need to reprioritize our approach to criminal justice, 
before we add another bill that duck tapes the problem, instead of genuinely trying to 
solve it. 
This bill would hurt my family and the people that are trying to help them recover. It 
would dehumanize people trying to get help.
People don't seek out to use drugs like fentanyl because they are evil. They are hurt. 
They need a coping mechanism, where our overpriced mental health systems 
consistently fails to meet them. Demonizing and criminalizing someone who is 
already hurt isn't the solution- stop trying to pretend it is. 
This is why I ask you to oppose LD 986.
