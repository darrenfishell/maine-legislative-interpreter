Dear Senator Rotundo , Representative Sachs , and Distinguished Members of the Committee on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs , 
My name is Lauren Pickford  and I am the Planning and Land Use Manager  for the Lakes Environmental 
Association (LEA), which serves the Lake Region of Western Maine and a ll of Maine’s lakes through 
the Maine Lake Science Center.   
LEA strongly  supports LD 212 : "An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Upgrad e 
Municipal Culverts at Stream Crossings ” 
Our organization is currently working to improve  road-stream crossings  in western Maine  and we have 
found many of the most problematic sites  are municipally owned. This bill would provide  a funding 
mechanism  for towns to take on these projects.  
Maine ’s clean streams  and rivers are unique  and provide habitat for fish and  other wildlife. Surveys have 
shown that the majority  of culvert crossings in Maine are some type of  barrier to fish passage  and other 
aquatic wildlife . Replacing damaged or undersized culverts with upgraded structures will  help maintain 
our iconic and nationally renowned native brook trout populations.  
Upgraded stream crossings  are also more resilient to climate change and flooding. Culvert washouts 
result in gravel, sand, and debris entering our waterbodies and can cut of f residents and businesses from 
emergency services.  Because the fixes have to be done quickly and often in winter months, they are 
usually expensive and temporary.  
This bill would provide much -needed funding to address all these issues and I hope you will vote “out to 
pass” on LD 212 . 
Thank you,    
 
Lauren Pickford  
Planning and Land Use Manager
