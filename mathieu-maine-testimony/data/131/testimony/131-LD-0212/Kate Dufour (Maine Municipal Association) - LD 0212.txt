In Support of   
LD 212, An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Upgrade Municipal Culverts at 
Stream Crossings  
 
March 27 , 2023  
 
 
Senator  Rotundo , Representative  Sachs, and members of the Appropriations Committee.  
My name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in support of LD 212 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest.   
Municipal officials support LD 212, which if adopted  by the voters  will enable the 
investment s necessary to upgrade municipal culverts .  In addition to protecting the State’s natura l 
resources, an investment of this nature  will provide the communities with the ability to  replace 
aging infrastructure with appropriately sized culverts , thereby reinforcing local roads that are 
susceptible to heavy storm events.   
Each year municipalities statewide expend roughly $275 million to maintain and improve 
municipal roads and bridges.  By offering matching grants , the program provides opportunities 
for municipalities to make more substa ntive improvements in local infrastructure , while 
simultaneously s upporting the state/municipal partnership.   
  Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about the Association’s position on this bill, pl ease do not hesitate to contact me at 
kdufour@memun.org  or 1-800-452-8786.
