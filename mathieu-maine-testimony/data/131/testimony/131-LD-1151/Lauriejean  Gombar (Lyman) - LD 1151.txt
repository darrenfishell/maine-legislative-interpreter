LD 1151
Senator Donna Bailey, Senator Cameron Reny, Senator Eric Brakey and distinguished
members of the committee, I urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD1151. 
Pharmacists and technicians are not given much training on vaccination reactions.  
There should be a safeguard in place for more training on what to watch out for. Even
so would any person watching a child be able to then take them in to be given any 
number of injections of their choosing and not necessarily the wishes of the other 
parent or guardian? Who is holding the liability for this and any reactions? Is a 
pharmacy a comfortable or logistically feasible place to watch for reactions for 
children? I am still not comfortable with the current use of pharmacies for the 
injections that are given now waiting right in the middle of the store.  Who is pushing 
this legislation? The pharmacies? The drug companies? Who is watching for the 
safety of the children?  Again I urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD1151.
