Testimony of Senator Teresa S. Pierce in support of 
LD 1151, An Act to Decrease Barriers to Preventive Health Services by Allowing 
Pharmacy Technicians to Administer Vaccines 
before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
April 6, 2023 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and esteemed members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Service Committee, my name is Teresa Pierce, and I represent Senate District 25, which 
includes Falmouth, Cumberland, North Yarmouth, Yarmouth (majority), Gray, and Long Island. Asa 
co-sponsor of this bill, I am before you today to speak in favor of LD 1151 “An Act to Decrease 
Barriers to Preventive Health Services by Allowing Pharmacy Technicians to Administer Vaccines ” 
and the accompanying amendments. 
This legislation is about accessibility and affordability, ﬁrst and foremost. This program was started 
during the pandemic, and it worked. It allowed all Mainers, but in particular those of low income, and 
those facing barriers to primary care, with the opportunity to stay up to date on vaccines. Vaccines 
are a part of routine medical care. They prevent serious illness from a variety of diseases, some that 
have historically wreaked havoc on unvaccinated populations. 
As the Legislature continues its work to expand access to healthcare and support our rural hospitals, 
this is a critical piece to increase the number of trained professionals able to vaccinate Mainers, and 
in the same vein, allow more Mainers to be vaccinated, who may not otherwise have access to these 
lifesaving vaccines. 
According to the Maine Immigrants ’ Rights Coalition, it is clear that indigenous Black African 
American Mainers, Hispanics and Latinos, and immigrants of color experienced disproportionate 
infection and harm from the COVID-19. Unfortunately, Maine’s minority population had the nation’s 
largest racial disparity in the country for COVID-19. 
According to the Portland Press Herald, there were also major discrepancies in rural vaccination rates 
versus urban vaccination rates. 
Working families with busy schedules, those who live a great distance from a doctor’s ofﬁce, or 
individuals with no primary care physician would all greatly beneﬁt from the passage of this 
legislation. 
I don’t want to repeat Sen. Ingwersen ’s testimony, but I’d like to reiterate one stat that stands out to 
me. Nearly 90 percent of vaccines commonly administered to adults were offered at pharmacies as 
opposed to non-pharmacy medical settings in both 2021 and 2022, compared to 50-60 percent in 
2018 and 2019.

I hope you will vote Ought to Pass on this legislation. I’m happy to answer any questions.
