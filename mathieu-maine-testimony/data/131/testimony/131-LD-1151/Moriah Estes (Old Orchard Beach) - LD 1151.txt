Distinguished members of this committee, thanks for taking the time. I am Moriah 
Estes from Old Orchard Beach and I am asking you to oppose this bill. What 
education do Pharmacy employees have on vaccines, their ingredients, reactions, and 
the correct doctors in Maine (or elsewhere) to send them to if reactions or adverse 
events occur? I had encephalitis after a vaccine when I was 19 and NO ONE would 
help me figure out what happened, even though I felt drunk and disoriented, and I 
talked to three different np's and doctors, so what exactly is a pharmacist supposed to 
know about vaccines? Do they know how many are live vaccines that can simply be 
spread fight after receiving them? How many (when you read the actual pamphlets) 
tell you to avoid people because the shot contained a live virus and could be spread? 
NO ONE EVER. Dr. Heidi Larson at the WHO 2019 Global Vaccine Safety summit 
states that "In Med school (med school!!!!!!!!), you're lucky if you have a HALF 
DAY on vaccines." I have posted the video below, but you can simply search that 
doctor and her quote online. Given the ABSOLUTE fiasco with the covid vaccine and
the gaslighting with all the others, I don't think ANYONE should be administering 
vaccines unless they have had SIGNIFICANT time studying them. And not just what 
they are great at, but their ingredients, reactions, and the correct doctors to send 
people to if they have reactions. Further more, doctors (or anyone) should be 
explaining THE FULL LIST OF SIDE EFFECTS TO EVERYONE. Mercks 
consumer website states that ENCEPHALITIS CAN BE CAUSED BY VACCINES, 
and it can start out feeling like a cold, flu, or headache. How many of us EVER 
received that info prior to a shot? NO ONE EVER. STOP TRYING TO PASS 
LEGISLATION THAT INCREASES VACCINE UPTAKE WHEN NO ONE 
READS THE ACTUAL INFORMATION FOR THESE PRODUCTS. DO 
SOMETHING TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT BY THESE 
PRODUCTS WHO ARE SCREAMING AT THE TOPS OF THEIR LUNGS TO BE 
HEARD.
