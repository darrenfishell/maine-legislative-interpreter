IN SUPPORT OF LD 1934 
Resolve, to Improve the Coordination and Delivery of Planning Grants and Technical 
Assistance to Communities in Maine 
May 25, 2023 
 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of  the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local 
Government, my name is Judy East, and I am the Dire ctor of the Bureau of Resource Information and 
Land Use Planning (BRILUP) in the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). I 
am testifying on behalf of DACF in support of LD 1934, Resolve, to Improve the Coordination and 
Delivery of Planning Grants and Technica l Assistance to Communities in Maine .   
This bill directs the Governor’s Office of Polic y Innovation and the Future (GOPIF) to review 
opportunities and structural changes in the organiza tion of State Government and make recommendations 
to improve the coordination and im plementation of planning grants and technical assistance programs for 
Maine communities and regional planning and develop ment organizations. Broad consultation is called 
for, and a report is due to this committee and th e Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee by 
December 6, 2023.  BRILUP is uniquely positioned to help with this b ill’s aims because we provide technical assistance and 
land use planning expertise to a broad cohort of entities relevant to the scope of LD 1934. We administer 
the Coastal Community Grant (CCG ) Program that assists municipalities and regional organizations to 
plan for climate resilience, among other goals. BRILU P also contracts annually with regional planning 
organizations to provide technical assistance to m unicipalities. BRILUP staff assist in grant program 
development and review to other agencies, includi ng GOPIF, the Department of Marine Resources, and 
the Department of Economic and Co mmunity Development, with the Co mmunity Resilience Partnership, 
Shore and Harbor grant program, and the Housing Op portunity Program, respectively. We are ready to 
participate in this initiative and recommend robust pa rticipation from the regiona l planning organizations 
that have extensive knowledge of the needs of municipalities.  Additional programs within BRILUP, the Maine Forest Se rvice, and the Bureau of Agriculture, Food, and 
Rural Resources also provide grants and technical assistance to municipalities. Should this bill pass, all 
affected programs will be interested and ready to participate in this discussion. 
 
Thank you for your time. I would happily an swer any questions at the work session.
