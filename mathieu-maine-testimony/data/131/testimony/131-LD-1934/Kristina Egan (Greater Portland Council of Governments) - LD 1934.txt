Re: Support of LD 1934, Resolve, to Improve the Coordination and Delivery of Planning Grants and 
Technical Assistance to Communities in Maine  
 
Dear Sen. Nangle , Rep. Stover , and Committee members ; 
 
Please accept this letter as the testimony of the Greater Portland Council of Governments (GPCOG) in 
support LD 1934, Resolve, to Improve the Coordination and Delivery of Planning  Grants and Technical 
Assistance to Communities in Maine .  
 
GPCOG serves 25 municipal members in Cumberland County, from Sebago Lake to Casco Bay, as well as 
Saco, Biddeford, Arundel, and Old Orchard Beach through the Portland Area Comprehensive 
Transporta tion System (PACTS). We deliver transportation, land use, sustainability, and economic 
development services to our members and their communities , and we collaborate with many state 
agencies in our work.   
 
LD 1934  directs the Office of Policy Innovation and the Future to review opportunities for structural 
changes in the organization of State Government and to make recommendations that will result in the 
improved coordination and implementation of planning grants and technical assistance progra ms for 
communities in this State and regional planning and development organizations.  
 
GPCOG supports LD 1934 because it offers an opportunity to improve the frequently  fragmented and 
uncoordinated state  approach to funding regional implementation of state and federal policies. With the 
passage of LD 1934 state agencies and regional organizations will work together to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of regional -state partnerships that advance our  shared goals of stronger 
municipalities.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to share our support of LD 1934 , and please let me know if GPCOG  can 
provide anything more to support your work on this important issue . 
 
Sincerely , 
Kristina Egan  
Executive Director  
Greater Portland Council of Governments
