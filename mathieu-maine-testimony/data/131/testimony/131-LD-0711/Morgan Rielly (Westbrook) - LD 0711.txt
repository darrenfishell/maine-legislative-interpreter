 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly in opposition to  
 LD 71 1, “An Act to Regulate Oyster Seed”  
 Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resour ces 
 Good   afternoon   Senator   Reny ,  Representative   Hepler   and  distinguished   members   of  the  Joint  
 Standing   Committee   on  Marine   Resources.   My  name   is  Morgan  Rielly ,  and  I  represent   House  
 District   127,  which   includes   part  of  Westbrook.   I  am  here  today   to  testify   in  opposition   to  LD 
 711,  An  Act  to  Regulate   Oyster   Seed.   This  bill  would   have   a  chilling   effect  on  oyster   farms  
 across   the  state.   And,   as  the  only  oyster   farmhand   in  the  legislature,   I  bring   today   the  experience  
 with these issues.  
 First,   nearly   all  farms   in  the  state  use  diploid   seed,   not  triploid,   which   has  different  
 characteristics   and  are  more   difficult   to  create.   There   is  also  only  one  hatchery   in  the  state  that 
 produces   triploid   seed.   Passing   this  legislation   would   be  highly   cost-prohibitive   for  farmers,   and 
 triploid seed would not be readily available in the quantities needed for our farmers.  
 Many   of  our  oyster   farmers   run  small   operations.   Money   is  tight,   and  the  stresses   farmers   feel  are 
 real.  My  fear  is  that  legislation   like  this  bill  could   be  the  final  nail  in  the  coffin  for  many   farms.  
 Taking   away   diploid   seed  would   put  an  incredible   strain   on  our  farmers   and  make   Maine’ s 
 osysers less competitive in the marketplace.  
 Maine’ s  oyster   farmers   are  willing   to  work   with  wild  shellfish   harvesters.   The  committee   will 
 hear  from   many   today .  I  also  know   that  some   wild  harvesters   have   even   started   farms   of  their 
 own  and  grow   oysters   from   diploid   seed.   And  many   farmers   also  are  licensed   with  seafood  
 dealers   who  buy  wild  clams   and  oysters.   I  want   to  be  clear   that  the  last  thing   I  want   is  the 
 displacement   of  wild  shellfish   harvesters.   We  want   both  farmed   and  wild  shellfish   to  coexist,   and 
 our state needs both wild and farmed shellfish.

 Thank   you  very  much   for  your  time  and  consideration.   I  urge  the  committee   to  stand   with  our 
 oyster farmers and   vote ought not to pass   .
