Island Institute
LD 711
The Island Institute is opposed to LD 711 because of the potential unintended impacts
and potential consequences to Maine's aquaculture industry. 
The Island Institute is a 40-year-old nonprofit organization based in Rockland, Maine.
We work to sustain Maine’s island and coastal communities. The Island Institute’s 
community development work focuses on the marine economy, climate and energy 
pilots, small businesses, education, and leadership. Our work is grounded in the 
intersection between scientific evidence and the lived experiences of island and 
coastal communities and those who make their livelihoods on the water.   
We work deeply with a variety of aquaculturists in the state, including those who 
grow oysters. Our understanding is that those growers use both dipolid and tripold 
oysters in their operations and a prohobition on dipolid oysters would adversly impact
the industry. 
We urge the committee to approach this issue with significant caution as well as with 
firm grounding in the underlying science and the potential economic impact.
