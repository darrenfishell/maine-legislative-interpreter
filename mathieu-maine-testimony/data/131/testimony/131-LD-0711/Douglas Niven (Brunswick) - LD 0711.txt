I am writing in OPPOSITION to this bill (LD711). 
First, oysters and clams utilize very different habitats, spawn at different times of the 
year and there is little evidence that they compete for food.
Second, diploids and triploids have different characteristics and there are advantages 
to using each. Taking an option away would put a huge strain on Maine oyster 
farmers and make them less competitive in the marketplace.
Third, multiple studies have shown that Eastern oysters and soft shell clams have 
coexisted for millions of years and have evolved specific life history strategies to 
reduce or eliminate competition. There is little if any scientific evidence that supports 
the assumptions inherent in this bill.
Lastly,  I am a grower and also a licensed seafood dealer.  I buy wild clams. It is not 
in our interest to harm the wild populations we depend on to provide a diverse product
mix to our customers.
Thanks
