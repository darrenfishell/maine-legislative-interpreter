LD 711
I am testifying to oppose Bill LD711. 
My name is Molly Bangs and I manage the shellfish hatchery for Muscongus Bay 
Aquaculture, Inc. Our hatchery was established in 1999 and since has provided 
diploid oyster seed to growers across the northeast and further. If the state were to 
outlaw the sale and production of diploid oyster seed, our business and the businesses 
of the hundreds of growers we provide seed to would be in jeopardy.
Triploid oysters are costlier and more difficult to produce on a large scale. Triploid 
oysters are not, as this bill claims them to be, completely sterile. They do reproduce, 
but in much smaller quantities than diploids. Furthermore, producing triploid oyster 
seed is not a 100% effective process, and the resulting seed contains a small 
percentage of diploid oysters. This would make enforcing this bill a nightmare for 
DMR, and could erroneously put growers in violation of the law should their seed fail
a ploidy test.
Most importantly- oyster farming is not the reason clam stocks are declining. Oysters 
and clams have coexisted in New England waters for millennia. They occupy 
different niches and spawn at different times of the year. I grew up foraging in coastal
salt ponds where the two species coexisted in plenty. The common enemy of all 
marine resources, whether wild or farmed, is climate change and its repercussions, 
and there is plenty of scientific evidence to back up this claim. Warming waters, 
invasive species, pollution and ocean acidification are the problems we should be 
working together to solve in order to protect and preserve the working waterfront that 
we are all a part of. It is the irresponsible spread of misinformation that has pitted 
fishermen and aquaculturists against each other. If the two industries continue to butt 
heads over non-issues like this, we are only getting further from confronting the real 
threats to our industries.
