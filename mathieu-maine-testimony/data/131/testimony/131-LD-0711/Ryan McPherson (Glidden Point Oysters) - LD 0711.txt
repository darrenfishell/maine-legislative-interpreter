Cameron, 
i oppose this Bill LD 711, HPO48O. 
This is a scary one for us. 
This would shut down our farm and the industry. 
There is little if any scientific evidence that supports the assumptions inherent in this bill. 
Glidden Point Oysters is supportive as a buyer of the wild clams and would not seek to harm that wild 
population because of the impact it has on our business. 
The industry can not be supported by triploid oysters for numerous reasons. We at Glidden Point 
have never used triploid for the risks that come with them at this time. On a trip to the west coast this
1
fall l saw all the Triploid risks have caused major production problems for some of the oldest and best 
shellfish farms in the country. They have in fact looked to us in Maine to help with supply as they work 
through those issues. Triploids are simply NOT a solution. 
I'll stop there but l could go on and on. 
Please if you have any questions let me know. 617 306 3956
