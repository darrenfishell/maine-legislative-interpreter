Testimony in Support of LD 711 
“An Act to Regulate Oyster Seed” 
Good moming Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, and members of Joint Standing Committee on 
Marine Resources. I am Representative Billy Bob Faulkingham and I am here to present my bill, LD 711, 
“An Act to Regulate Oyster Seed”. 
This bill as drafted would restrict oyster farmers operating under a lease or license issued by the 
Department of Marine Resources to growing oysters only from seed that yields sterile oysters 
that do not reproduce. 
I submitted this bill on behalf of a constituent, however since it has been drafted, additional 
infonnation regarding science and market impact have been brought to my attention. 
While I am still concerned about the potential for interactions between cultured oysters and soft 
shell clams, I now respectfully believe that we need more time to study this issue. 
I remain committed to working with all stakeholders to protect the necessary balance. 
Maine needs Oysters and Clams, now more than ever. I look forward to continue this dialogue 
moving forward. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, I would be happy to answer any questions you may 
have. 
Respectfully, 
Representative Billy Bob Faulkingharn
