LD 711
I have been growing oysters here in the New Meadows River since May 2014.  Most 
of that time I have grown both diploid and triploid oysters.  The oysters are grown in 
bags on the surface.  About 75 ft inshore from the oyster bag lines are two spots 
totaling less than 1000 square feet where soft shell clams have always grown.
I have harvested these spots many times over the years and therefore have a good 
sense of their productivity.  They have also been commercially harvested as recently 
as this past fall.  Despite the close proximity of tens of thousands of oysters, I have 
not seen any negative affect on the clam population.  
Furthermore, in part of one of these spots I have thrown oversized and ugly oysters 
onto the intertidal. This has had no observable impact on the clams growing beneath 
them.
My conclusion is that restricting growers to triploid oysters would probably have no 
beneficial impact on soft shell clams.  I certainly would want to see some controlled 
scientifically based data accumulation before even considering a law such as LD 711.
I personally have had very mixed results trying to grow triploid oysters and based on 
my experience doubt that a successful oyster industry can evolve in the state.
