Dear Marine Resources Committee, 
Waldoboro Clammers support LD711. 
This bill was brought forward by Fisherman.  That means its probly 
based on common sense,  and it is.  Aquaculture(like the green crab) is 
an invasive species.  That’s why legislature is seeing so many bills on it.  
The green crab and aquaculture are not welcome here.  That explains 
why the state has to sneak behind towns backs to peddle aquaculture.  
It kinda speaks for itself doesn’t it.   
The bad effects of an aquaculture oyster site on a river are completely 
unknown.  One downfall is the mass seed the site produces.  Where 
does it go and what does it do?  One piece of this very questionable 
practice can be fixed with this bill.  If aquaculture truly does not want to 
hurt the habitat of the river they will support this bill.  If they don’t 
support LD711 we have to assume they don’t care what their seed does 
and we need to question their agenda.  LD711 forces aquaculture to be 
responsible for their practices and their product.  Lets see if 
responsibility truly is a priority for them.
