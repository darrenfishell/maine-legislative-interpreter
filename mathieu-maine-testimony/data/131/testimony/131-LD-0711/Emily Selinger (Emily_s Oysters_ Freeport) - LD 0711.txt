LD 711
I am submitting this testimony to urge the committee vote “ought not pass” on bill 
LD711 “An Act To Regulate Oyster Seed,” first and foremost because it is purely 
based in an assumption that is not backed up by any scientific evidence or study. 
There is, however, evidence to show that the eastern oyster has coexisted with clam 
species historically, and therefore no reason to assume now that this native species of 
oyster, which once grew wild in much greater numbers on our coastlines, would pose 
a threat to clam stocks today. Soft shell clams and oysters thrive in different kinds of 
bottom substrates, reproduce at different times and we have no reason to believe that 
they would compete for food with one another. I have been growing diploid seed on 
my shallow farm site in Freeport for 6 years now and see zero evidence in any of the 
immediate or surrounding areas and flats that the presence of my crop has resulted in 
any amount of a wild oyster population settling in the area. I know and work 
side-by-side with several local clammers in my area, and never once have I head 
mention or concern that would suggest this is a credible concern. 
Additionally, eliminating the option of diploid seed for our oyster farms to buy and 
grow would create a huge barrier to both our growers and our hatcheries, as the costs 
both to produce and purchase triploid seed are prohibitive. We currently only have 
one hatchery that is able to produce triploid seed, and there’s no way they could 
effective serve a sudden, massive increase in demand.
Passage of this bill would be a direct threat to the success of my business, along with 
many others, and it would provide additional pressure, demands and expenses on 
DMR which cannot be afforded at this time.
