Hello --
Mike Gaffney here -- of Eros Oyster in Georgetown.
I write in opposition to LD 711.
Of the 9 oyster farms in Robinhood Cove, Georgetown, some of which grow diploid 
oysters -- half are owned by clammers who report no incursion of oysters in the 
Cove's clam flats.
Farming is risky and the industry's reliance on both diploid and triploid seed reduces 
the risk of catastrophic loss.  
Unless their is strong scientific evidence of oyster damage to soft shell clam 
populations, I would suggest that the key to protection of our state's marine resources 
lies in diversification rather than monoculture.
Thank you.
