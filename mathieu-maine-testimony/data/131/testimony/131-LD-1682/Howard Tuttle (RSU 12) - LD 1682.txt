Joint
Standing

on
Agriculture,

Forestry
T estimony
in
Support
of

An
Act

Experiential

Program
Senator
Ingwersen,
Representative
Pluecker ,
and
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on 
Agriculture,
Conservation,
and
Forestry ,
My
name
is
Howard
T uttle,
and
I
am
the
Superintendent
of
Sheepscot
Regional
School
Unit
12.
I 
am
writing
to
support
the
passage
of
LD
1682,
An
Act
to
Create
the
Maine
Experiential 
Education
Program.
I
would
like
to
thank
Representative
Shaw
for
introducing
this
crucial 
legislation.
For
the
past
five
years,
RSU
12
has
partnered
with
FoodCorps,
a
national
non-profit
or ganization 
that
collaborates
with
schools
across
13
states
to
provide
experiential
learning
opportunities 
related
to
food,
cooking,
and
gardening.
Through
this
partnership,
FoodCorps
has
helped
us 
provide
hands-on
lessons
to
excite
students
about
consuming
fruits
and
vegetables
and
supported 
the
school
nutrition
staf f
in
providing
nourishing
meals.
The
RSU
12
School
Board
envisions 
providing
students
with
the
knowledge
to
make
healthy
food
choices
and
understand
the 
importance
of
local
whole
foods
and
where
these
foods
come
from.
It
is
widely
recognized
that 
people
of
all
ages
learn
best
through
hands-on
activities.
Most
individuals,
especially
children, 
learn
through
movement.
Experiential
learning
is
highly
ef fective
for
students
of
all
ages,
as
it
engages
their
bodies
and 
minds.
RSU
12
educators
and
community
members
have
called
for
less
time
at
desks
and
more 
outdoor ,
tactile,
and
movement-based
learning
opportunities.
However ,
there
are
barriers
to 
implementing
experiential
education,
primarily
related
to
capacity
and
funding.
Staf fing
for 
experiential
education
is
not
included
in
the
state
subsidy
for
education
formula
and
grant 
programs
are
rare,
competitive,
and
short-lived.
Ongoing
Professional
development
for
educators 
is
also
critical
in
order
to
build
and
ef fective
program.
LD
1682
creates
a
grant
program
to
help
schools
cover
the
costs
of
initiating
and
implementing 
experiential
education
programs.
This
is
critical,
as
funding
has
been
a
major
barrier
for
many 
schools
in
initiating
and
implementing
experiential
education
programs.
W ith
this
program, 
schools
will
be
able
to
access
funding
to
cover
the
costs
of
materials,
training,
and
staf f
to
start 
and
implement
experiential
education
programs.
Moreover ,
the
bill
also
includes
provisions
for
reporting
and
evaluation,
ensuring
that
the
grant 
program
is
transparent
and
accountable.
This
will
help
to
ensure
that
the
program
is
ef fective
and 
that
schools
are
able
to
make
the
most
of
the
resources
that
are
available
to
them.
Overall,
LD
1682
is
a
well-crafted
and
necessary
piece
of
legislation
that
will
help
to
provide 
Maine
students
with
the
experiential
education
opportunities
they
need
to
thrive.
By
providing 
support
and
resources
to
schools,
LD
1682
will
help
to
break
down
the
barriers
that
have 
prevented
many
schools
from
initiating
and
implementing
experiential
education
programs.
By 
doing
so,
Maine
students
will
be
better
prepared
to
succeed
in
the
21st
century
economy
and
will
P a g e
1
o f
2
be
better
equipped
to
make
informed
choices
about
their
health
and
well-being.
As
the
Superintendent
of
Sheepscot
Regional
School
Unit
12,
I
have
seen
firsthand
the
benefits 
of
experiential
education.
Our
partnership
with
FoodCorps
has
helped
to
provide
our
students 
with
hands-on
learning
opportunities
that
have
deepened
their
understanding
of
food
and 
nutrition.
W e
have
seen
the
positive
ef fects
of
these
programs
on
our
students'
behavior ,
mental 
health,
and
academic
performance.
I
am
confident
that
with
the
passage
of
LD
1682,
more 
schools
in
Maine
will
be
able
to
provide
their
students
with
similar
opportunities.
In
conclusion,
I
ur ge
the
members
of
the
Maine
Legislature
to
support
LD
1682.
This
bill
is
a 
critical
investment
in
the
future
of
Maine's
students
and
will
help
to
ensure
that
they
are
prepared 
to
succeed
in
the
21st
century
economy .
Our
kids
and
teachers
need
this
tool
to
help
with 
learning
and
development.
Our
board
is
eager
to
see
experiential
learning
continue.
I
hope
you 
will
vote
ought
to
pass
on
LD
1682.
I
am
happy
to
answer
any
questions
you
may
have,
and
I 
will
do
my
best
to
provide
any
additional
information
you
may
require.
I
am
happy
to
be
of 
service
when
you
discuss
this
bill
in
the
work
session.
Sincerely ,
