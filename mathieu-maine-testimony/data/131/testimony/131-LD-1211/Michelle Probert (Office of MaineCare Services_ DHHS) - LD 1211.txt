Re: LD 1211  – An Act to Require the Department of Health and Human Services to Fund Out -of-
state Residential Treatment for Substance Use Disorder When In -state Treatment Is Unavailable  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide information on LD 1211 , An Act to Require the Department of Health 
and Human Services to Fund Out -of-state Residential Treatment for Substance Use Disorder 
When In-state Treatment Is Unavailable . This bill requires the Department of Health and Human 
Services to provide reimbursement under the MaineCare program for out -of-state residential 
treatment for substance use disorder when residential treatment is unavailab le in the State.  
 
The services identified in this bill are already covered under MaineCare Benefits Manual, 
Chapter 1, Section 1.14 -2, Out -Of-State Services. Medical care that is covered under MaineCare 
that is only available outside the State of Maine is covered with a prior authorization (PA).  The 
out-of-state provider must enroll as a MaineCare provider for the State of Maine and must accept 
MaineCare reimbursement as payment in full for the covered services authorized.  
 
No out -of-state Private Non -medi cal Institutions for Substance Use Treatment Facilities (PNMI -
Bs) have billed MaineCare since 2018. It is possible that barriers exist to out -of-state services 
such as out -of-state providers’ willingness to enroll in MaineCare , adhere to MaineCare policies , 
and complete prior authorization  requests . 
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director  
MaineCare Services
