Esteemed Committee Members,
My name is Ron Greco and I run Moose Maine Kids.  MMK is a 501c3 non-profit with a sole 
goal of increasing youth participation rates in traditional outdoor activities like hunting and 
fishing.  We support LD 831.
LD 831 is a bill to address the poor results in some Moose Hunting zones over the past few 
seasons.  We support this bill and support creating a working group to further evaluate the low 
success rates in some areas of the moose hunt.
Sincerely,
Ron Greco
Executive Director, Moose Maine Kids
