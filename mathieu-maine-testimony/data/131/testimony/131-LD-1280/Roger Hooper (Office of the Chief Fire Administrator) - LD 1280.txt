RE: TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT or LD1280 
Dear Committee Members: 
I am writing in support of LD 1280 An Act to Invest in Maine's Fire Service Training Facilities. 
l am sure you all are aware that Maine’s Fireﬁghter workforce is in crisis. Fire Departments 
around the state, from the largest career ﬁre departments to the smallest volunteer ﬁre departments, are 
ﬁnding it increasingly more difﬁcult to recruit and retain Fireﬁghters. 
Quality training is the comerstone of recruitment and retention of ﬁre service personnel. The 
people of this Great State deserve, and should demand, qualiﬁed and competent public servants. 
Fireﬁghters are ﬁrst on scene of every emergency in Maine. They must be properly trained. This 
bill will provide the funding to provide facilities to conduct quality and proper training of our 
Fireﬁghters. 
I do hope you will support LDl280, Maine’s future depends on it. 
Ve ,,Respect ﬁ1lly, 
/%@»~e~-~ 
Roger S. Hooper 
Chief Fire Administrator, York County
