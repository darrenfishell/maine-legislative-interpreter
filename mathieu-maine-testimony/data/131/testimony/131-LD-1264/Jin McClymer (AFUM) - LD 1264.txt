Testimony in FAVOR of LD 1264
I am Jim McClymer, a resident of Glenburn, a physics professor at the University of 
Maine, and President of the University of Maine System faculty union, AFUM. I am 
testifying in support of LD 1264 to establish a Commission to Update Public Policy 
on Higher Education.
This Commission brings together those doing the primary mission of our University 
System; education, research, and service- the Faculty, along with UMS leadership as 
well as legislative and other leaders. 
This Commission is timely with serious concerns facing us. Challenges that can lead 
to simple solutions that cause continuing damage, or more nuanced and informed 
responses that allow us to not only respond to todayâ€™s challenges, but challenges and 
opportunities yet to come.
This dialog can enrich our System and set up UMS to serve the Citizens of Maine 
more effectively in the coming decades.
Thank you
