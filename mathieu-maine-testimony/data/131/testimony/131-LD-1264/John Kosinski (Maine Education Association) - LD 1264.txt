Testimony  
In Support  
LD 1264: Resolve, Establishing the Commission to Update Maine’s Public Policy on Higher 
Education   
John Kosinski, Government Relations Director, Maine Education Association  
Before the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee  
April  11, 2023  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other esteemed members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee,   
 
My name is John Kosinski (he/him)  and I am proud to serve as the Director of Government Relations for 
the Maine Education Association (MEA).  The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, 
including teachers and other professionals in nearly every public school in the state an d faculty and other 
professional staff in the University of Maine and Community College Systems.  
 
I submit this testimony on behalf of the MEA in support of LD 1264, Resolve, Establishing the 
Commission to Update Maine's Public Policy on Higher Education.    
 
I hope we all agree our public higher education system is a critical investment in our state. Our public 
higher education systems are training critical thinkers and providing the resources to help Maine meet its 
workforce challenges, while also being l eaders in research, development, innovation and business 
incubation in our state.  Over the past four years, the state has recognized the critical role the University 
of Maine System, the Community College System and Maine Maritime Academy play in our stat e with 
significant increases in state support in various ways.  
 
Over the past many years and then again this legislative session, there have been a multitude of bills 
addressing various facets of our state’s public higher education system.  We have seen p iecemeal 
concerns raised about shared governance, the role of adjuncts, student enrollment declines or increases, 
among many other matters.   
 
This bill proposes a Commission to evaluate and make recommendations regarding the current state 
public policy as  it relates to our state’s higher education system.  Such a Commission could delve into 
the current policy framework, understand its application, and look for ways to address concerns raised 
by leaders, faculty, students, and the community of supporters of  public higher education.  Ideally, this 
Commission could bring forward policy recommendations for this Committee to consider and may 
alleviate the various bills that come before this Committee in the future that attempt to address various 
facets of our st ate’s public higher education systems.

For these reasons, the MEA supports a global review of our public higher education policy and we 
support LD 1264.
