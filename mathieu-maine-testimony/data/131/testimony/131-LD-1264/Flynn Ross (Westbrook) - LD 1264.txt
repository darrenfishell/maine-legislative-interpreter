Westbrook
LD 1264
April 11, 2023
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other esteemed members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
My name is Flynn Ross, (she/her) I live in Westbrook and have worked in higher 
education for 25 years in Maine after being a student and employee in higher 
education for eight years prior to that in other states. 
I am here to testify in support of LD 1264 Resolve, Establishing the Commission to 
Update Maine's Public Policy on Higher Education. 
Higher Education is essential to preparing Maineâ€™s leadership, workforce, and citizens
of the future. 
The bill is well written and thought through to bring together diverse constituents to 
build transparency and update systems for efficiencies and operations in the 21st 
century. 
The revolutions of on-line learning and preparing leaders and workers for an 
information and innovation economy require updated systems of governance and 
collaborations across sectors.
