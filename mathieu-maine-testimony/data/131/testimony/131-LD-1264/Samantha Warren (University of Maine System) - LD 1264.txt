Testimony from the University of Maine System 
Presented by UMS Director of Government & Community Relations Samantha Warren 
In Support of LD 1264, Resolve, Establishing the Commission to Update 
Maine's Public Policy on Higher Education, April 11, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs: My name is Samantha Warren and I am the Director 
of Government Relations for the University of Maine System (UMS), which supports LD 1264, 
Resolve, Establishing the Commission to Update Maine’s Public Policy on Higher Education. 
Maine’s public universities recognize that State statute governing higher education is often 
outdated and does not always reflect today's postsecondary students; the new modalities in 
which our institutions provide high-quality education and research learning to them; and the 
dynamic context of higher education, employer and community need, and innovation that leads 
to new and effective models of higher education. Portions of the section on public policy have 
not been updated since 1981, eight years before the University of Maine at Augusta led the 
nation in pioneering the use of ITV to allow place-bound learners to have access to higher 
education in their home communities for the first time. And the chapter governing New Ventures 
Maine still includes language about “displaced homemakers." 
Maine is also unique in not having a State agency or overarching governing body strategically 
focused on higher education beyond review of requests fordegree-granting authority and 
assessment and approval of educator preparation program. For example, just in New England, 
New Hampshire has a higher education commission, Massachusetts has a Department of 
Higher Education, Vermont has a higher education council, Connecticut has an Office of Higher 
Education and Rhode Island has an Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner. 
Furthermore, legislative jurisdiction of higher education policy and investment, especially as it 
relates to affordability, is bifurcated between this esteemed Committee and the Committee on 
Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business, which has oversight for the 
Finance Authority of Maine and its student assistance programs like the Maine State Grant. 
As the foremost educational and research enterprise in the state, UMS often takes the lead as 
convenor and authority on state-level higher education matters and continues to welcome that 
important responsibility. For example, the State Higher Education Executive Officer (SHEEO) 
for the state is the UMS Chancellor and the UMS Chancellor is also a standing delegate to the 
New England Board of Higher Education (referred to in statute as the New England Higher 
Education Compact.) During the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was UMS Chancellor 
Dannel Malloy who convened the leaders of Maine’s public and private institutions to develop a 
reopening framework, which drew on the expertise of the R1 University of Maine’s scientists and 
economists. UMS, along with the Maine Community College System, is also a founding partner 
of MaineSpark, a coalition that created and works to advance the state’s 60% by 2025 
postsecondary degreelcredential attainment goal, which is actually codified in the section of 
State statute focused on labor and industry (Title 26).

marketplace of public investment to advance college access and affordability at some 
institutions reinforce that the time is right for strategic conversations about public policy on 
higher education, as do questions about how the State’s process for authorizing degree- 
granting institutions might better consider impact on existing programs (Chapter 149). 
For these reasons, we appreciate Representative Millett bringing forward this idea and urge you 
to pass LD 1264. Not only does this offer a long-overdue opportunity to modernize statute to 
reflect changes in higher education landscape and best practice over the past three-plus 
decades, but UMS hopes that it also helps elevate the increasingly important role of affordable 
higher education to advancing the social and economic mobility of Maine people and our state. 
UMS generally supports the proposed composition of the Commission, and would additionally 
suggest that a gubernatorially appointed, legislatively confirmed member from each public 
system/academy Board of Trustees be included, given the important statutory role they have in 
governance, policy and planning. For UMS Trustees, this includes responsibility to “Plan 
strategies for programs and allocation of resources that most effectively serve the educational 
needs of the citizens of this State" and “Develop and maintain a strong system of accountability 
to the public for performance results of the system" — both of which are relevant to the duties of 
the proposed commission. We would also encourage the addition of a representative of the 
State Board of Education, given that board’s authority includes “establishing standards for 
teacher certification, approving educator preparation programs and recommending institutions 
of higher education for degree-granting authority." 
We look forward to participating in this process and thank the Committee for your support of 
Maine’s public institutions and our students.
