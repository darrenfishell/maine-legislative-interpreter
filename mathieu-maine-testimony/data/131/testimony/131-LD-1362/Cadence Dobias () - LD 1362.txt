Cadence Dobias
LD 1362
My name is Cadence and as a survivor of sexual assault, I know all too well the 
powerlessness and pain that survivors experience in a system that fails to provide the 
support they deserve. As an advocate, I have seen first-hand how survivors are left to 
fend for themselves as they navigate a complex landscape of bureaucracy and 
injustice. In the midst of this, I have also seen the power, resilience, and hope of 
survivors who are determined to advocate for change and challenge the status quo. It 
is that same challenge of injustice that is maintained within LD-1362 and is the reason
I am here today.
Too often survivors are held back by the system, the complexity of the process, and a 
lack of resources and support. Providing survivors the right to a sexual assault 
counselor during law enforcement interviews and the right to not have forensic 
evidence used to prosecute them for any misdemeanor substance abuse charges would
be critical steps to ensuring survivors can receive the support and justice they deserve.
It would be a beacon of hope for those who have endured unimaginable hardship and 
a reminder that their voices, stories, and experiences are being heard.
Today, you all have the opportunity to empower the 455 thousand survivors of sexual 
assault in Maine through LD-1362. So, I ask that you all stand with us today. Stand 
with survivors and stand with the movement for hope and justice as you bring about 
lasting change. Thank you.
