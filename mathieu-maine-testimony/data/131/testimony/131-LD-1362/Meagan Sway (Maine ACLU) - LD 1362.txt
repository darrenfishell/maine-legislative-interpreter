AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION 
Maine
‘ 
TESTIMONY OF MEAGAN SWAY, ESQ. 
LD 1362 — Ought To Pass 
An Act to Ensure the Rights of Survivors of Sexual Assault 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
April 11, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, greetings. My name is Meagan Sway, and-I 
am the policy director at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed to 
advancing and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and 
U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our members, We support LD 1362, that would 
protect victims of sexual assault from criminalization. 
According to a Justice Department analysis of violent crime, 77 percent of 
rapes and sexual assaults go unreported.1 Reasons that survivors give about Why they 
don’t report include a fear of retaliation from both the perpetrator and broader society 
and a fear that police will not help them? And, included in a fear of seeking help, is 
the reality that a rape examination kit often includes a toxicology kit, which can lead 
to evidence that a person was on illegal drugs at the time of the assault. This can 
create a fear not only that if a victim reports her assault she won’t' be believed, but 
that she herself will find herself facing criminal charges because she looked to police 
for help.A 
Ingesting drugs or alcohol should not be a crime, and no one should ever fear 
that she will be prosecuted because she chose to report her sexual assault to police. 
We ask you to support LD 1362.’
