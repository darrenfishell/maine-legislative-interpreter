Box 17642 Portland, ME 04112-8642 (207) 523-9869      mainemacdl@gmail.com  April 11, 2023   Senator Anne Carney, Chair Representative Matt Moonen, Chair Committee on Judiciary 100 State House Station, Room 438 Augusta, ME 04333   RE: LD 1362: An Act to Ensure the Rights of Survivors of Sexual Assault   Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Committee on Judiciary:  MACDL submits this testimony neither for nor against LD 1362: An Act to Ensure the Rights of Survivors of Sexual Assault.  We are focusing our testimony on the proposed new language that would constitute Title 15, section 6203, “Prohibition on use of evidence gathered during sexual assault forensic examination.”   As written, the bill would only disallow the use of DNA and other biological evidence gathered from a victim during the course of sexual assault investigation to be used against them in a misdemeanor prosecution or in a crime involving drugs—crimes in which DNA and high-level forensic evidence is hardly ever the basis for prosecution anyway.  Quite simply, this ostensible protection is wholly inadequate.  When a victim of a sexual assault consents to the collection of their DNA and other biological evidence, they are doing so at a completely vulnerable and traumatic moment. They are doing so under unimaginable circumstances. They are doing so to assist police and prosecutors arrest and convict the alleged perpetrator of assault. That is the only reason they provide such access to their bodies.   As written, this bill would allow that evidence to be collected, stored, and used in future prosecution for any felony apart from a drug felony. This not only is unfair and underhanded, it would completely dissuade victims of sexual assault from providing such evidence in the cases for which they are victims. This cannot be what the advocates of this bill want.  For police to get access to a person’s DNA, they typically need a search warrant, under our protections under the Fourth Amendment from unreasonable searches and seizures. Allowing the collection of such evidence from vulnerable victims at the height of their trauma to be used against them in the future for ANY crime should not be allowed or contemplated.   If we truly care about protecting victims of sexual assault, we cannot tolerate making it easier to prosecute them in the future for any crime, simply because they provided the state access to their DNA or other evidence in connection to the crime perpetuated on them. This is not what the founders would have wanted. This cannot be what we do to exploit victims’ vulnerability in the moment, to ease prosecution later on.  
Thank you for your consideration and your attention to this matter.                      Sincerely,        /s/ Tina Heather Nadeau, Esq.                                MACDL Executive Director
