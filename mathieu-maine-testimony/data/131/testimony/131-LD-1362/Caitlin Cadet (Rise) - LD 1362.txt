Dear
Chairman
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
address
you.
My
name
is
Caitlin
Cadet.
I
write
today
as
an
ally
to
survivors
and
as
a
woman
af fected
by
the
tremors
of
sexual
violence.
On
January
21,
2017,
I
helped
or ganize
the
lar gest
single-day
mass
protest
in
the
history
of
the
United
States.
The
W omen’ s
March
brought
together
women
and
allies
from
all
backgrounds,
political
persuasions,
and
religions
from
all
around
the
world
to
stand
together
against
misogyny ,
against
violence,
and
against
hatred.
For
many ,
the
W omen’ s
March
helped
us
feel
a
little
less
alone.
A
little
less
helpless.
A
little
bit
stronger .
That
same
evening
as
I
was
dismissing
the
last
group
of
volunteers,
one
of
the
volunteers
on
my
team,
a
man
at
least
30
years
older
than
me,
forcibly
pulled
me
toward
him
and
kissed
me
on
the
lips.
I
did
not
consent
to
or
welcome
this
action.
I
was
visibly
uncomfortable
and
humiliated
in
front
of
other
volunteers
who
had
looked
up
to
me.
Suddenly ,
after
a
day
of
feeling
so
empowered,
I
felt
alone
and
so
small.
My
strength
was
gone.
I’d
known
this
feeling
before.
I
first
learned
what
rape
was
when
I
was
1 1
years
old,
in
the
fifth
grade.
While
kicking
around
a
soccer
ball
after
school,
my
good
friend
confided
in
me
that
on
a
recent
family
vacation,
she
was
raped
in
a
hotel
room.
That
feeling
of
helplessness
set
in
right
away—my
friend
was
in
pain.
And
there
was
nothing
I
could
do
to
make
things
right
for
her .
It
was
this
sinking,
powerless
feeling
I’ve
felt
in
my
stomach
every
time
since
then
when
I’ve
heard
from
another
friend,
classmate,
or
co-worker
who
has
experienced
sexual
violence
and
has
walked
the
long,
lonely
road
toward
justice.
But
I’m
here
today
because
I
now
know
I
am
not
helpless.
W e
are
not
helpless.
W e
can
support
survivors,
starting
by
breaking
down
the
barriers
faced
by
survivors
in
the
justice
system.
T oday ,
survivors
face
immense
challenges
from
a
system
that
re-victimizes
them
when
they
seek
basic
care
and
justice.
T oday
I
ur ge
you
to
support
LD
1362.
This
bill
presents
an
opportunity
to
improve
conditions
for
survivors
like
my
childhood
friend.
It
safeguards
basic
protections
for
survivors,
such
as
the
right
to
consult
with
a
sexual
assault
counselor
and
for
evidence
collected
during
a
rape
kit
examination
to
not
be
used
against
the
survivor .

Access
to
justice
shouldn’ t
depend
on
one’ s
zip
code,
and
survivors
everywhere
deserve
basic
rights.
Through
this
bill
(LD
1362),
you
have
the
opportunity
to
join
statehouses
around
the
country
and
improve
conditions
for
the
survivors
of
Maine.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
