LD 835
LD 835 ought-TO-pass as it supports the concept of less taxation actually promotes 
revenue. This has been a proven model for other states i.e. FL. 
Enactment of this bill will encourage needed talent to move to this state and invest in 
Maine resources and contributing to a robust economy. 
Thank you.
