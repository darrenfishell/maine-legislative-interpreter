Re:  Opposition to LD 1259  (An Act to Recover Legal Fees for Low -Income Individuals in Actions 
or Proceedings)  
 
Dear Senator Carney  and Representative Moonen : 
 
My name is Edward L. Zelmanow and I write in opposition to LD 1259.  While LD 1259 may be  considered  
a well -intentioned attempt to provide equal access to representation for low-income individuals, such provision 
would have the conse quence of  unduly burden ing plaintiff litigants who legitimately need  to utilize the Maine 
courts to seek redress.  
 
As written, LD 1259 would apply to all civil litigation and would un reasonably and unduly burden the 
litigation process  as it applies to litigants and the courts.  
 
 LD 1259 requires that a ll parties submit to the court a financial statement at the time of 
commencement of the litigation to determine whether a party is a “covered  individual ” or an 
“institutional  entity. ” In addition, a party wishing to rebut the presumption that they are an 
institutional  entity  must submit their tax records from the previous three years. These 
requirements  would create a significant barrier to litigation and they would create additional 
stress on the limited resources and time of both judges and court clerks.  
 
 LD 1259 would operate contrary to the long followed “American Rule” regarding 
attorney’s fees ; a rule  rooted in  notions of freedom and equal access to justice. In requiring both 
the plaintiff and defendant to pay their own legal fees, the American rule was established to 
ensure no one would hesitat e to file a legitimate court case due to the fear of having to pay f or 
the other party’s legal fees.     
 
 LD 1259 would  result in absurd outcomes  by allow ing covered individuals to recover their 
attorney’s  fees in all cases where the plaintiff is not awarded judgment , even where the plaintiff 
voluntarily dismisses the  litigation . For example, if a  law suit is commenced against a covered 
individual and the plaintiff subsequently learns that the covered individual ’s only source of 
income is exempt, the plaintiff will have no choice but to move forward with the litigation  to 
judgment  rather than voluntarily dismiss the action  or risk being required to pay the covered 
individual ’s attorney’s  fees.  This requirement would have a vast chilling effect on legitimate  
litigation since use of the courts will expose parties to substantial attorney’s fees even where 
they maintain meritorious claims.   
 
 In the context of debt collection litigation, any plaintiff who brings a debt collection action 
is already required to pay a $127.00 surcharge which is deposited in the Civil Legal Services Fund; 
a fund created to support civil legal services to persons who otherwise are not able to pay for 
these services. If passed, LD 1259 wo uld unfairly impose a further monetary charge against such 
plaintiffs.  
 
 Low-income individuals currently have access to “No Fee” legal services provided by such 
agencies, groups, and individuals such as: Legal Services for the Elderly, Pine Tree Legal 
Assistance, the Cumberland Legal Aid Clinic, The Maine  Volunteer  Lawyers  Project , Consumers 
for Affordable Healthcare , Disability Rights Center of Maine , Maine Equal Justice Partners , and 
individual attorneys who represent and provide such legal assistance pro bono . This new 
requirement would create an impossible burden for party plaintiffs as well as attorney’s fees to 
protect consumers who already enjoy the aforementioned Maine services.  
 
It is for the above reasons that I ask this committee to not support LD 1259. I thank you for your time 
and consideration of these comments.  
 
Respectfully submitted , 
 
 
Edward L. Zelmanow, Esq.
