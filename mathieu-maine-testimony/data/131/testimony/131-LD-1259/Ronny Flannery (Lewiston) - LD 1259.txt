Dear
Esteemed
Members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
On
behalf
of
the
undersigned
or ganizations,
we
are
writing
to
ur ge
you
to
support
LD
1259:
An 
Act
to
Recover
Legal
Fees
for
Low-income
Individuals
in
Actions
or
Proceedings,
also
known
as 
the
“Equal
Access
to
Justice
Act.”
Many
low-income
Mainers
are
unable
to
access
justice
through
our
legal
system.
This
is
due
to 
the
high
costs
of
obtaining
an
attorney .
According
to
a
2022
report
by
the
Legal
Service 
Corporation,
92%
of
low-income
Americans
receive
inadequate
or
no
professional
legal 
assistance
for
their
civil
legal
challenges
in
any
given
year .
For
even
the
small
percentage
of 
low-income
individuals
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
receive
assistance
from
legal
aid 
or ganizations,
it
is
often
limited
to
basic
legal
advice
and
then
connecting
the
individual
to
an 
attorney
who
can
hopefully
either
take
a
case
on
a
pro
bono
or
contingent
fee
basis.
But
Maine 
attorneys
do
not
have
the
current
bandwidth
to
meet
the
current
demand
on
a
pro
bono
basis. 
And
the
challenge
to
meet
the
demand
is
exacerbated
in
rural
Maine,
where
1 1
out
of
16
Maine 
counties
only
have
14%
of
the
total
lawyers
in
the
State.
For
a
low-income
individual
who
is 
fortunate
enough
to
find
an
attorney
willing
to
take
on
a
matter
on
a
contingent
fee
basis,
their 
remedies
issued
by
the
courts
are
often
reduced
by
legal
costs
and
attorney’ s
fees,
failing
to
make 
the
harmed
Mainer
whole.
The
Equal
Access
to
Justice
Act
would
help
fill
the
justice
gap
and
create
greater
access
to
legal 
services
for
low-income
Mainers.
The
legislation
shifts
the
obligation
to
pay
legal
costs
and 
reasonable
attorney’ s
fees
from
low-income
Mainers
who
prevail
in
civil
or
administrative 
proceedings
to
non-prevailing
entities
with
greater
resources
–
$100,000/year
net
income
for
the 
last
three
years
–
who
harm
or
take
legal
action
against
the
prevailing
low-income
Mainer . 
Finally ,
the
Equal
Access
to
Justice
Act
makes
clear
that
an
award
of
legal
costs
and
reasonable 
attorney’ s
fees
recoverable
under
the
legislation
does
not
af fect
any
remedies
or
other
fees,
costs 
or
expenses
otherwise
recoverable
by
the
prevailing
low-income
Mainer .
W e
believe
that
the
Equal
Access
to
Justice
Act
could
significantly
increase
access
to
justice
for 
those
who
are
otherwise
unable
to
af ford
legal
services.
Mainers
in
rural
communities
would
be 
better
positioned
to
find
legal
representation
from
local
lawyers
who
otherwise
have
to
balance 
their
current
paid
workload
with
what
pro
bono
matters
they
can
af ford
to
take
on.
The 
legislation
would
also
make
it
more
feasible
for
lawyers
to
represent
low-income
Mainers
in 
cases
with
smaller
damages
or
non-monetary
relief,
which
otherwise
would
not
be
suitable
for 
contingent
fee
practices.
Finally ,
the
legislation
makes
a
harmed
low-income
individual
more 
whole
by
ensuring
the
harmed
Mainer ’ s
legal
costs
and
reasonable
attorney’ s
fees
are
paid
by
the 
non-prevailing
entity
with
more
resources,
in
addition
to
any
remedy
successfully
sought
by
the 
low-income
Mainer .
The
costs
under
this
bill
is
borne
by
the
losing
party ,
not
by
the
taxpayer .

For
these
reasons,
we
back
the
Equal
Access
to
Justice
Act
and
respectfully
request
your
support 
of
the
legislation.
Thank
you.
