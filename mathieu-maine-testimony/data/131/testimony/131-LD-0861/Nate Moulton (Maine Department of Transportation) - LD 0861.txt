Testimony of Nate Moulton 
Maine Department of Transportation 
Before the 131$‘ Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
In Opposition 
LD 861 
Resolve, Directing the Department of Transportation to Identify the Canadian Paciﬁc 
Railway Railroad Lines from Hermon Station Through Brownville and Jackman to 
Quebec and Montreal as a Major Corridor and to Fund a Feasibility Study 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, I am Nate Moulton, Transportation Planning Division Director at 
MaineDOT. MaineDOT is in opposition to LD 861, Resolve, Directing the Department of 
Transportation to Identijy the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway Railroad Lines from Hermon Station 
Through Brownville and Jackman to Quebec and Montreal as a Major Corridor and to Funda 
Feasibility Study. 
Being a concept draft MaineDOT is unable to formulate a speciﬁc detailed response. However, 
we see no need to fund a feasibility study of any type on these lines. MaineDOT works with 
Canadian Paciﬁc (CP) on their planning and project efforts within the State and they provided 
information related to their plans and operations for the recently published Maine State Rail 
Plan. In our preparation of the rail plan, no party or stakeholder identiﬁed or discussed a need 
for this type of project. No one has reached out to either the MaineDOT or CP (who owns these 
lines) in regards to this proposal. CP noted in an email to MaineDOT that they would oppose 
this proposal based on the title. 
It is for these reason that we recommend the committee vote ought not to pass on LD 861. 
Thank you.
