Greetings
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
T ransportation:
My
name
is
Angela
King,
Advocacy
Manager
for
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
(BCM).
Our
mission
is
to
make
Maine
better
and
safer
for
bicycling
and
walking.
On
behalf
of
BCM,
and
aligned
with
the
views
of
our
more
than
20,000
members
and
supporters,
this
testimony
is
submitted
in
OPPOSITION
to
LDs
406,
860,
861,
880
and
1 170.
The
BCM
supports
passenger
rail
as
a
transit
solution
where
it
is
viable
and
cost-ef fective.
W e
do
not
support
spending
money
for
feasibility
studies
on
remote
railroad
lines
that
cannot
sustain
passenger
rail.
And
we
cannot
support
the
MaineDOT
planning
to
restore
service
on
a
line
that
was
recently
recommended
for
conversion
into
a
trail.
The
Coalition
is
largely
agnostic
on
the
notion
of
studying
the
feasibility
of
expanding
passenger
rail
generally
(LD
406,
and
LD
1 170),
as
well
as
for
rail
links
to
Bangor
(LD
860)
or
through
Herman
(LD
861).
That
said,
we
expect
that
these
studies
would
only
find
that
Maine
cannot
at
this
time
support
passenger
rail.
Passenger
rail
service
decreased
decades
ago
to
the
point
where
it
was
not
feasible
to
keep
trains
running
on
most
rail
lines,
and
this
has
not
changed
according
to
current
data.
Amtrak
Downeaster
service
continues
to
expand
and
has
been
a
valuable
transit
option
for
southern
coastal
Maine.
The
recent
study
done
by
the
Greater
Portland
Council
of
Governments
(GPCOG)
for
their
long-range
transportation
plan,
Connect
2045,
shows
that
the
population
growth
in
that
area
is
not
near
the
density
to
support
passenger
rail.
If
the
most
densely
populated
area
in
the
state
cannot
support
passenger
rail,
it
is
dif ficult
to
believe
that
regions
beyond
the
Greater
Portland
area
can.
Given
this
data,
our
opposition
is
based
on
concerns
as
to
whether
these
feasibility
dollars
might
be
better
spent
on
building
actual
transportation
facilities.
W e
also
are
concerned
that
these
calls
for
more
study
or
service
restoration
are
really
little

more
than
tactics
to
further
delay
the
construction
of
trails
on
fallow
railroad
corridors.
Thus
the
BCM
is
strongly
opposed
to
LD
880’ s
call
for
the
MaineDOT
to
plan
to
restore
service
between
Portland
and
Auburn.
This
opposition
would
extend
to
any
rail
corridor
between
Portland
and
Bangor
identified
in
LD
860
that
is,
or
has
been,
the
subject
of
a
“Rail
Use
Advisory
Council”
(RUAC)
process.
While
neither
LD
860
nor
LD
880
clearly
identify
which
line
is
the
focus
of
this
feasibility
study
or
“service
development
plan”
immediately
north
of
Portland,
it
is
likely
that
both
the
Berlin
Subdivision
and
the
privately
owned
CSX
line
will
be
examined.
Establishing
passenger
rail
service
on
the
CSX
line
would
require
complex
negotiations
with
a
private
owner ,
leaving
the
Berlin
Subdivision
as
the
likely
focus
of
these
bills.
The
Berlin
Subdivision
Rail
Use
Advisory
Council
(RUAC)
concluded
that
the
unused
rail
line
between
Portland
and
Lewiston-Auburn
should
be
converted
to
an
interim
trail.
The
development
of
a
service
plan
for
this
line
will
be
used
to
slow
down
action
on
creating
the
trail
that
the
majority
of
residents
in
the
area
would
like
to
see
built,
and
which
the
group
dedicated
to
studying
the
issue
recommended.
The
BCM
is
supportive
of
any
mode
that
reduces
reliance
on
single
occupant
automobiles,
and
thus
we
in
principle
support
rail.
But
we
also
believe
that
if
there
was
a
chance
that
the
market
economy
could
make
a
profit
running
trains
in
Maine,
it
would
have
happened
already .
W e
believe
that
if
MaineDOT
felt
that
the
passenger
rail
was
worth
the
huge
public
investment,
it
would
have
happened
already .
Conducting
endless
feasibility
studies
only
postpones
interim
conversion
of
unused
railroad
corridors
into
trails,
wastes
money ,
thwarts
the
decision
of
legislatively-directed
processes
like
the
RUACs,
and
is
simply
bad
policy .
Thus
we
recommend
and
request
ONTP
reports
on
LD
406,
LD
860,
LD
861,
LD
880,
and
LD
1 170.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service
to
the
people
of
Maine.
Sincerely ,
Angela
King
Advocacy
Manager
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
