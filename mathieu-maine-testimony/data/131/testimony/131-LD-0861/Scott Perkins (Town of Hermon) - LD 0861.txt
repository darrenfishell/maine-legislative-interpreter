LD 861
The Town of Hermon Economic and Community Development office is strongly in 
favor of LD 86, "An Act to Identify the Canadian Pacific Railway Railroad Lines 
from Hermon Station Through Brownville and Jackman to Quebec and Montreal as a 
Major Corridor and to Fund a Feasibility Study."
The State of Maine and the central Maine region would benefit by classifying this 
section of rail as a "Major Corridor" in order to advance public transportation 
opportunities by rail in the future. Both CSX Rail and CP Rail are Class 1 railways 
extending from the west coast of the United States to Searsport. With the recent 
expansion of CP Rail specifically to our region, multi-use rail opportunities for 
transporting goods and services including a passenger rail extension to points north 
for the Bangor area should be examined and a study accomplishes a first step towards 
the goal of increasing economic development opportunities in the State of Maine and 
the business/service centers here locally.
Feasibility studies are a fundamentally good use of planning dollars in order to weigh 
the benefits of a potential transportation system improvement that strengthens our 
economy while offering a sustainable, environmentally friendly option to traditional 
methods of transportation. Maximizing our existing infrastructure to advance this idea
makes sense and gives Mainers one more tool in the box to accomplish their personal 
and professional goals regarding economic viability, mobility and connectivity with 
public and private opportunities.
Thanks in advance for considering LD 861!
