Re: LD 463 — Resolve, to Ensure Continued MaineCare Coverage for Persons Formerly in 
Foster Care Until They Attain 27 Years of Age 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:' 
This letter is to provide you with information that might be helpful to you in your deliberations 
regarding LD 463. This Resolve requires the Department of Health and Human Services to 
amend its rules by November 6, 2024 to provide MaineCare coverage for a person formerly 
placed in foster care until the person attains 27 years of age. 
Maine currently provides MaineCare coverage to former foster youth if they are under the age of 
26, not enrolled in other Medicaid coverage, and were on Medicaid in Maine and in foster care 
when they turned age 18. This is a mandatory Medicaid coverage group established by 
l902(a)(l0)(A)(i)(D() under the Social Security Act. 
In January 2023, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and 
Treatment for Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) Act, Pub. L. No. 115-271, expanded 
eligibility to individuals who were in foster care from other states. The Ofﬁce for Family 
Independence has amended Medicaid applications and eligibility systems to provide this 
expanded coverage.6 
It is unclear if the intent of this Resolve is to extend the existing coverage for fonner foster 
youth for one additional year (above current eligibility) or if it is to provide MaineCare access to 
anyone who is under the age of 27 that left foster care at any age. Regardless of intent, it is 
unlikely this action can be achieved via state plan amendment and would require a waiver. 
Medicaid Waivers take more than 12 months to draft and seek federal approval. This Resolve 
would also require signiﬁcant technology system changes for both the Office for Family 
Independence and the Office of MaineCare Services that could not begin until after June 1, 
2024, due to the volume of technology priorities and unwinding efforts from both the end of the 
national Public Health Emergency and changes required through the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2023. Federal approval required for this proposal, system changes, staff 
training and rule-making cannot be achieved by November of 2024 as required by this Resolve.
