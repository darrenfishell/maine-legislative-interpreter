Krystyna Dzialo, Deputy Executive Director, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, 
My name 1S Krystyna Dzialo My pronouns are she, her, hers I am proud to serve as the Deputy Executive 
Director for the Maine Education Association The MEA represents nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine 
system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well as in our institutions of higher education, both the 
University of Maine System and the Maine Coimnunity College System, along with students in teacher prep 
programs as well as many retired educators 
I am submitting testimony on behalf of the MEA in suppoit of LD 1842 Resolve to Support Energy Upgrades at 
Maine Public Schools and Ensure That New School Construction Meets Current Energy Efficiency Standards 
The need for new school construction and upgrades continues, while communities struggle to find ways to fund 
these important p1'O_]CClS There 1S a need to explore different options available to school districts that provide 
energy efficient, cost effective, healthy systems to heat, cool and power Maine’s schools 
There are many ways that schools can make changes in their facilities to move away from their reliance on 
fossil fuels and shift towards increasing the use of renewable energy resources, such as solar power Making 
this shift will save schools and taxpayers money and allow for more resources to be spent on students and 
education There is no question that the cost of heating and cooling our schools and homes continues to 
increase Bringing together key stakeholders and experts to review the possibilities will provide a collaborative 
opportunity to create the best learning environment for Maine students and provide financial relief for school 
districts and taxpayers Creating better environments for our students to learn and grow in 1S important for their 
success 
Two months ago, I submitted testimony in support of LD 612 An Act to Create a Green Schools Coordinator in 
the Department of Education LD 1842 1S another way that the State of Maine as well as the key stakeholders 
can work together to create healthy learning environments for Maine’s students that reduce energy related 
spending 
MEA 1S a member of the Maine Labor Climate Council and meets with other unions who are engaged in this 
work and who are in compliance with the labor standards included in the federal funding LD 1842 presents an 
opportunity for Maine to move forward in providing options and resources to improve the conditions in our 
public schools 
I urge you to support LD 1842
