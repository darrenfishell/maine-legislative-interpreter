Testimony of Rep. Tavls Hasenfus introducing 
LD 1892, An Act to Make Student Transfer Agreements Renew Automatically 
Except in Certain Circumstances 
Before the Education and Cultural Ajfazrs Committee 
Good mormng, Senator Rafferty, Representat1ve Brennan and members of the Educat1on and 
Cultural Affa1rs Comm1ttee My name 1s Tav1s Hasenfus, and I represent House D1str1ct 57, 
Wh1Cl'l 1s the commumtles of Readﬁeld and Winthrop I am here before you today to lntroduce 
LD 1892, An Act to Make Student Transfer Agreements Renew Automatically Except lll 
Certain Circumstances. 
Th1s mtent of th1s b1ll 1s to provlde transfer students w1th the assurance that, so long as they 
actlvely part1c1pate 1n the1r educatlon 1n a respectful manner, the1r agreements w1ll not be 
resclnded 
Current law allows for a school transfer agreement and pI‘OV1d6S that 
6. Transfer students. The followmg prov1s1ons apply to transfers of students ﬁom one school 
admnnstratlve umt to another 
A Two supenntendents may approve the transfer of a student from one school admmlstratlve umt to 
anoﬂ1er 1f 
(1) They ﬁnd that a transfer 1s 1n the student's best mterest, and 
(2) The student's parent approves 
Currently, these agreements requ1re fam1l1es to renew them annually Th1s b1ll proposes we 
ehmlnate the annual renewal requlrement and have such agreements last as long as the ch1ld 
remalns enrolled 1n the rece1v1ng school In approving the agreement, 1t has already been 
detennlned that the transfer 1s 1n the student’s best lnterest Therefore, 1t loglcally follows that 
unless the student has had a substantial change 1n cnctunstances, cont1nu1ng the agreement 
would cont1nue to be 1n the ch1ld’s best mterest
1 
You may hear that th1s b1ll 1s problematrc as superlntendent agreements were not mtended to be 
for more than one year However, 1n practlce these agreements are annually renewed, and many 
students, and the1r famlhes, have begun to expect 1t to cont1nue to be renewed year after year 
Moreover, once a transfer detennlnatlon has been made to a rece1v1ng d1str1ct, ma1nta1n1ng the 
status of the agreement w1ll l1kely be 1n the ch1ld’s best lnterest Ma1nta1n1ng cont1nu1ty for 
students 1s of 1ncred1ble 1mportance for a stable leam1ng env1ronment Movlng schools can be 
traumatlc for many students and s1gn1ﬁcantly set them back both educatlonally and emotlonally 
A supermtendent agreement 1s _]1lSI that, an agreement, and both partles have obl1gat1ons It 1s 
patently unfa1r to allow one party to termlnate the agreement when c1rcumstances outs1de of the 
ch1ld’s control m1ght make the agreement less convement, such as when add1t10nal students 
move 1nt0 the d1str1ct and lncrease class slzes Though 1t may reduce a class s1ze by one student 
1f there 1s an mﬂux of students one year, forc1ng that ch1ld away from h1s or her frlends, teachers 
and commumty 1s certalnly not 1n the best 1nterest of that ch1ld and w1ll certamly causea 
hardsh1p on the ch1ld 1n the course of the1r educatron 
A rece1v1ng school should absolutely have the opt1on to termmate an agreement, but not when 
the cause of the termlnatlon was outs1de of the student’s control The student should be 
accountable for h1s or her actlons, but should not be vrewed as dlspensable when budgets get 
t1ght, class s1zes lncrease, pandemlcs ar1se or for any other reason not related to the student 
As I mentloned earl1er, a transfer agreement places obl1gat1ons on the student, not _|ust the 
recelvmg school I took care 1n craft1ng th1s b1ll to make sure that a student has obl1gat1ons to be 
an act1ve, respectful and respons1ble part1c1pant 1n the1r learnlng and that of thelr fellow 
classmates If the student’s part of the agreement 1s not met, the agreement should be term1nated 
as 1s appropnate Th1s b1l1prov1des for th1s scenar1o 
Thls b1ll 1s desrgncd to ensure that students who have establlshed themselves 1n a healthy 
learnlng env1ronment cannot be demed the opportumty to retum because of factors outs1de of 
the1r control I bel1eve 1t 1s a reasonable request to ensure cons1stency and stab1l1ty for our 
students I am more than wrllmg to Work w1th the comrmttee on any amendments deslred and as 
always am ava1lable for quest1ons
