LD 1076
Good afternoon Sen. Chipman, Rep. Williams, and members of the Transportation 
Committee. 
My name is MaryAngela King-Horne, and I live in Pownal, Maine.
I support LD 1076 to expand the use of automated traffic enforcement. Speed cameras
have proven to affect driver behavior in other states, reminding them to slow down.
Signage should be part of this process. Before drivers are in the camera zone, signage 
to remind drivers that they need to slow down as they approach work or school zones 
has proven to draw drivers’ attention and reduce speeds. 
Speed cameras are meant to increase road safety by causing people to reduce their 
speed. Signposting makes drivers who are paying attention slow down and be safe, 
which is the main goal. And for
distracted drivers, fines can be learning lessons that save lives in the future.
People – students and workers – are often on the roads in these areas. I have had 
experiences in both these types of zones that reinforces the need for this automated 
traffic enforcement. When riding a bicycle with my son to his school, we were often 
passed at high speeds. And with all the roadway construction right now, I have 
bicycled
and walked through areas with construction workers. The workers kindly 
acknowledged my presence outside of a car, and helped me get safely through the 
work zones; however, it brought to my attention how automobile drivers often do not 
slow down and put roadway workers in a dangerous space.
For these reasons, I urge the Transportation Committee to support LD 1076.
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine.
Sincerely,
MaryAngela King-Horne,
