TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 1076  
 
AN ACT TO EXPAND THE USE OF TRAFFIC CAMERAS FOR SCHOOL AND WORK ZONES  
 
Senator Chipman , Representative Williams  and members of the Transportation  Committee.  I am Eileen King, 
deputy executive director  of Maine Schoo l Management A ssociation, testifying on behalf of the legislative 
committees of the Maine School Boards Association  and Maine School Superintendents Association , in 
support of  L.D. 1076 . 
 
Many students cross roadways on their way to and from school placing  them in danger from speeding 
vehicles . 
 
School zones have signs alerting you to the designated areas stating there is a school ahead or that show 
images of children or pedestrians . Unfortunately, not all drivers adhere to the warnings, putting our student s in 
danger. This bill is intended to reduce the number of speeding vehicles traveling through school zones, thus 
reducing the likelihood of crashes, or injuries, especially those involving children.  
 
We appreciate that this bill makes the data of the came ras confidential and restricts the dissemination of the 
data to only the purposes of investigation or prosecution of a violatio n of the law.
