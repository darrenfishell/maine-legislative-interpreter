LD 557
I am writing in support of LD 557: An Act to Decrease Discrimination Based on 
Evictions in Housing Applications. By preventing landlords from asking about prior 
evictions on an application or using eviction history against an applicant when 
selecting a tenant, it equals the playing field. Evictions are more likely to be 
implemented upon those of lesser means and, often, tenants are unaware of how to 
fight evictions. Eviction proceedings are a significant disadvantage to tenants in 
general, making it difficult to fight unjust evictions. Given how much our housing 
market is based on rentals, diminishing the relevance of evictions will also help to 
prevent homelessness and broader housing precarity. Thank you for your time.
