LD 557
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Judiciary Committee: my name is Nikki Williams, I am a resident of 
Portland and I am writing in favor of LD 557.
Eviction is the number one cause of homelessness, in large part because an eviction 
on someoneâ€™s record is a major barrier to finding new housing. Evictions happen for 
many reasons, often not the fault of tenants, but Maine does not (yet) protect against 
no-cause evictions. Making this change is not an onerous burden on landlords. They 
have plenty of other screening tools for tenants.
Thank you for your time,
Nikki
