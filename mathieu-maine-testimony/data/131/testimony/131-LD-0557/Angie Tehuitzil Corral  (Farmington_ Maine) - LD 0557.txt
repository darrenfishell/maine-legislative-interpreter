“An Act to Decrease Discrimination Based on Evictions in Housing Applications”
LD557 
Chair Carney, Chair Moonen, and distinguished members of the judiciary committee,
My name is Angie Tehuitzil, I live in Farmington, Maine and I work as a legislative 
fellow for Maine Youth Power, a youth-led, youth movement throughout rural and 
suburban Maine fighting to win human dignity, equity and a livable future for all. 
I am here today to ask that you support Representative Rana’s bill,  LD557 “An Act 
to Decrease Discrimination Based on Evictions in Housing Applications.” 
Having recently moved to Maine I am an independent full-time college student. One 
of my biggest struggles is attempting to make ends meet. On top of that, being part of 
a minoritized group, I live in fear of what my  housing situation will look like in the 
future. By supporting this act, it alleviates the anxieties of housing insecurities for me 
and many other students.
Fair housing for all is essential to end any discrimination such as racial disparities, 
gender, sexuality, social class, etc. The state's future success is highly dependent on 
encouraging youth  to stay and move to Maine. This can be accomplished by making 
the  housing process equal for all, despite differences and past evictions.  
I am here today to stand with young Mainers and people with housing insecurities by 
supporting LD557 and make Maine a better place to live. 
Thank you for your time.
