  RE: Testimony for Opposition to LD 557  
   Dear Senator Carney and members of the Judiciary Committee:  
  My name is David Pare and my wife Tera and I own 3 apartment bu ildings in Augusta, 
comprised of 8 rental units.  We have lived in one of these apartments for 18 years.  
There has been great sacrifice to be able to purchase these properties and rehabilitate them so that our tenants have safe, clean, affordable  homes.  We have put our blood, 
sweat, tears, and money into this endeavor and our success has centered on acquiring 
trustworthy and respectful tenants.  
 LD 557 has recently come to my attention that would prevent landlords from inquiring 
about previous evictions and "discriminating" against those applicants who have previously b een evicted.  As a small  landlord, this bill would completely prevent me from 
effectively screening applicants to find the best candidates who respect the  property, 
are considerate of  their neighbors, and pay their rent in a timely fashion.  
 This bill would  put those who have previously not complied with their rental agreement  
into a protected class.  Those people in legitimate protected classes who actually 
deserve protection from discrimination should be appalled by the mere suggestion of this. 
 Furthermor e, this bill would in no way improve the current housing crisis that we have in 
Maine.  In fact, t his is the precise type of legislation that could turn small landlords like 
myself toward the short -term vacation rental market . 
 I implore you to oppose LD 5 57 since it could certainly endanger the ability of all 
landlords to provide quality  housing to Maine tenants.  
  Sincerely,  
 
David Pare  
Augusta, Maine
