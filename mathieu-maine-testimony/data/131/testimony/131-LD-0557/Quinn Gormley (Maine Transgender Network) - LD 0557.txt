Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary
Testimony of Maine Transgender Network
LD 557: An Act to Decrease Discrimination Based on Evictions in Housing Applications
February 6, 2023
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Judiciary Committee:
my name is Quinn Gormley, I am the Executive Director of the Maine Transgender Network and
I am testifying today in support of
LD 557: An Act
to Decrease Discrimination Based on
Evictions in Housing Applications.
That Maine is struggling to cope with a housing crisis should not be news to any leaders in our
state. Housing insecurity affects many, but has a disproportionate impact on marginalized
people. According to data from the 2021 Maine Transgender Community Survey, transgender
Mainer’s experience significant disparities in access to housing including:
●
46% have lived or stayed somewhere where they felt unsafe to avoid homelessness
●
12% have stayed in a homeless or emergency shelter
●
36% have experienced homelessness at some point in their lifetime, and 11% have
experienced homelessness in the last 12 months.
Transgender Mainers experience poverty at twice the rate of the general population, and
evictions related to poverty, unstable employment, and abuse are unfortunately all too common.
These histories of struggle hold them back as they seek to create stability and find new housing.
Ensuring that landlords cannot use a history of evictions when considering an application for
housing will remove one barrier to achieving this stability and is an essential part of meaningfully
addressing Maine’s housing crisis.
Thank you to Representative Rana for their leadership on this issue, and we enthusiastically
encourage you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 557.
Thank you,
Quinn Gormley
Maine Transgender Network
