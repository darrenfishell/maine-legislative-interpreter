Amber Ridge Properties, LLC
LD 557
I oppose LD 557.  Previous history is a good indicator of future history.  Landlords 
with good tenants are successful.  Successful landlords can bring increased value to 
tenants and the neighborhood.  Amber Ridge Properties, LLC has done this in its 
neighborhoods, however, putting our ability to identify good qualified tenants will put
us at risk and ultimately devalue the community.
