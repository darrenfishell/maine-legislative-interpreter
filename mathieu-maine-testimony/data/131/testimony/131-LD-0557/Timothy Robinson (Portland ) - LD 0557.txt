Dear legislator: 
In every sector of society past history is used as an indicator of future performance. 
This includes batting records, child sex offences, academic GPA, credit  history for 
car loans, mortgages, and credit cards. As a mom and pop land lord I find it ridiculous
that you are even considering this legislation! 
If you want to give people a 2nd, 3rd, and 4rth chance be proactive, by an abandoned 
mill, convert it to housing, and provide housing for those who are unable to secure it.  
Please however take note of the saying, "Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice 
shame on me." 
In addition, please watch the old movie "Pacific Heights" which clearly indicates the 
unintended consequences of providing housing for people. 
This battle was previously fought during and after the American Revolution and 
codified in the Fifth amendment. I do not want soldiers or past criminals  living under 
my roof, eating my food, and potentially raping my wife. 
Please, stay out of my house!
Dr. Robinson
