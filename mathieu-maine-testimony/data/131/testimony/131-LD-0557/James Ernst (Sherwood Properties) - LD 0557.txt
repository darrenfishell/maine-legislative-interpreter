LD 557 - An Act to Decrease Discrimination Based on Evictions in Housing Applications  
Testimony
As a landlord since 2001, I have rented to people of all races, family status, and social economic 
status. Unfortunately, I have had to evict many people, not because I wanted to, but because I had to.
Through my experience, I have learned that tenants who have been evicted are not good people to 
rent to.
If a tenant has been evicted, it is most likely due to financial reasons, with most evictions being for 
non-payment. As a landlord, it is important to be able to screen tenants to determine if they have 
been evicted, as this can be a sign of financial instability and other potential risks.
Tenants who have been evicted may have a history of causing property damage, violating rental 
agreements, and engaging in illegal activities on rental properties. These behaviors can lead to legal 
issues for landlords, costly repairs or renovations, and disruptions that may cause other tenants to 
move out.
Effective tenant screening is crucial for landlords to find good tenants and maintain good properties.
Failing to screen tenants can lead to more problems in the rental market, which can ultimately affect
the overall rental market in Maine.
In conclusion, as a landlord, I have learned that it is important to screen tenants effectively to avoid 
potential risks associated with renting to individuals who have been evicted. By doing so, I have 
been able to maintain good properties and avoid the many problems that can arise in the rental 
market.
LD 557 is bad for landlord and will be bad for Maine.
