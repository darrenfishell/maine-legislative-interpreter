Testimony of Frank D’Alessandro, Maine Equal 
Justice 
In support of LD 557 “An Act to Decrease 
Discrimination Based on Evictions in Housing 
Applications” 
March 9, 2023
Good afternoon, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of 
the Committee on Judiciary. My name is Frank D’Alessandro, and I am the Legal Services 
Director of Maine Equal Justice. We are a civil legal services organization, and we work 
with and for people with low income seeking solutions to poverty through policy, 
education, and legal representation. Thank you for the opportunity to offer testimony in 
support of LD 557. 
Maine Equal Justice supports LD 557 because evictions are a gender justice issue, a racial 
justice issue, an economic justice issue, a children’s rights issue, and a civil liberties issue. 1 
Evictions have enormous negative effects that are felt not just by those evicted, but by the 
entire community. Our state is in a serious housing crisis, rents continue to increase and the 
infrastructure and money that has been supporting many of our state’s most vulnerable is 
coming to an end. A mass eviction crisis is at our doorstep.2 This bill is an important step 
towards mitigating the outsized effects of eviction in our state. 
What This Bill Does
This bill will ensure that individuals applying housing are not unfairly denied because of a 
previous eviction.

Maine is Facing a Looming Eviction Crisis
With the end of rental assistance, with average rents increasing more than 14% year to year,
3 with housing prices soaring, and with the seventh highest in-migration in the country 
between April 2020 and July 2022,4 the ingredients for an eviction crisis are mixing 
together. From 2001 to 2018, “renter incomes grew by 0.5 percent” while “rents increased 
by 13 percent.”5 The end of rental assistance and the unbridled rises in rental costs has led 
to at least 41% of tenants in Maine being “cost-burdened” (spending more than one-third of 
their gross income on rent) and 20% of those being “severely” cost-burdened (spending 
more than half of their income on rent).6 As of 2022, nationwide, at least 20% of renters are 
currently behind on payments.7 Add to this that Maine is somewhere between 20,000 and 
25,000 housing units short,8 and that nationally there is “less housing available for rent and 
sale than at any time in 30 years,”9 and what we are left with is a recipe for disaster. This 
looming eviction crisis is only likely to get worse, and so it is the perfect time to take action 
that could bring Maine back from the edge of crisis. 
Evictions Disproportionately Affect Communities of Color and Women
Evictions are a racial justice and gender issue because evictions disproportionately affect 
people of color, women, and specifically women of color. Black and Latino/a people “are 
more likely to be renters across income levels and are disproportionately represented in 
jobs with low wages, compounding the damage of these rental unaffordability trends.”10 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, “minority renters have been disproportionately affected 
by the economic effects” of the pandemic, like losing their jobs.11 Black and Latino/a 
families are twice as likely as their white counterparts to have little to no ability to make

rent each month.12 Nationally, Black individuals constituted almost 20% of all adult renters 
but were nearly 33% of all eviction filings,13 and four out of every five black renter lives in 
a county where landlords disproportionately file evictions against Blacks.14 Black renters 
face serial eviction filings (eviction filed repeatedly against the renter at the same address) 
at a rate of 14.9%, Latino/a have a rate of 13.2%, and Asians have a rate of 11.8%. All the 
while, whites have a rate of 9.8%.15 In general, women are nearly 16% more likely to be 
evicted than men.16 But, in particular, Black women are twice as likely than white women 
to have an eviction filed against them,17 they are more likely to have an eviction filed 
against them that is dismissed, and they are the group most harmed by the current tenant 
screening policies that blacklist an individual with even a single eviction.18 Additionally, 
over 60% of Black women renters are cost burdened, making them even more vulnerable 
for eviction filings.19 
Though the data in Maine is less robust,20 the national trends are also found in Maine. In 
Maine, Black women renters are filed against for eviction at double the rate of white 
renters.21 Indeed, Pine Tree Legal Assistance has reported that 12% of the tenants they 
represent in evictions identify themselves as people of color, though only 5% of Maine’s 
population is non-white. Similarly, Maine Housing data shows that 26% of Maine’s 
homeless population is Black or African American even though only 1.4% of Maine’s 
population is Black or African American.22 It is clear that that the “threshold for filing

“[E]ven when court records can be accessed, there are many questions that the data does not 
answer, including how eviction rates vary by race, ethnicity, gender, familial status, and disability, 
and whether evicted renters have a housing subsidy, a prior eviction judgment on their record, or 
other risk factors, such as a job loss. Finally, inconsistency surrounding the type of information that 
is included in an eviction file can make the data difficult to aggregate across cases and compare 
against other jurisdictions and states.” Id.

against white renters is higher than the threshold for filing against black and Latin[o/a] 
renters.”23 There can be no question that evictions are a racial and gender issue.
Evictions Disproportionately Affect Children
Evictions are a children’s rights issue. Renters with children are 17% more likely to be 
evicted than those without children.24 Additionally, renters without children who fall 
behind on rent have an eviction rate of 8%, but those in the same position with children 
have an eviction rate of 20%. This means that for eviction rates, having children is 
“equivalent to falling 4 months behind in rent.”25 Additionally, the increase in children in a 
neighborhood correlates to an increase in evictions in that neighborhood. A one percent 
increase in children in a neighborhood increases the neighborhood eviction rate by 6.5%.26 
In neighborhoods where children made up 25% of the population 1 in 18 renters was 
evicted. In neighborhoods with 35% children, 1 in 14 renters were evicted, and where 
children are 40% of the population, 1 in 12 renters is evicted. 27 Children as young as 4 
months old have been evicted.28
Landlords often view children as problems. Young children can test positive for lead 
poisoning, which can cost the landlord thousands.29 In disadvantaged neighborhoods, 
parents often require their children to stay indoors, and this can lead to noise issues and 
property damage.30 Young Black and Latino boys attract the attention of police, which can 
lead to violations against the landlord.31 In larger cities, 15% of children have been evicted 
once by fifteen years old. For Black children that number goes up to 19% and for Latinos 
that goes up to 17%, as compared to 11% for white children.32 For children living in “deep 
poverty” (living below 50% of the poverty line), 29% have been evicted by age fifteen.33 
More and more children are being listed on rental leases, and when they are evicted that 
will stay on their record (blacklisted) for their lifetime.34 This puts them at huge 
disadvantage for future housing.
Children that live with housing insecurity deal with enormous ramifications for their 
education and their future potential. Childhood evictions in urban areas is a powerful 
predictor of lead poisoning.35
A housing change during childhood can lead to half a year of loss in school.36 Children that

are forced to move three or more times generally have lower earnings, fewer work hours, 
and less educational attainment.37 Children with unstable housing “are more likely to be 
truant, and are more likely to drop out”38 and they “are at higher risk for developmental 
delay, decreased academic achievement, anxiety, depression, behavioral disturbances, and 
even death.”39 
Eviction Records Are Unreliable and They Do Not Give a Full Picture
Public court records have historically been known to have errors in them, and in particular 
eviction records are even more error prone. A recent study of 3.6 million eviction court 
records found that “22% of state eviction cases are ambiguous or false records.”40 The 
National Center for State Courts has specifically warned tenant screening companies that 
the databases are “not the official records of the court . . . and may be subject to error[s] or 
omission[s]” that require further verification for the “accuracy, currency, and completeness 
of the information retrieved.”41 In fact, eviction records are so unreliable that three largest 
credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—“have stopped reporting eviction and 
other judgments because they lack information, like Social Security Numbers or dates of 
birth, that are critical in order to accurately match court records with the correct consumer.”
42 In Maine, “several challenges” arise when trying to understand eviction records because 
of the “inconsistencies in the information included in eviction filings.”43 However, tenant 
screening companies still are using these same unreliable eviction records to unfairly deny 
housing to Mainers. 
Not only are the court records unreliable, they also do not give a full picture of the person, 
the possible eviction, and whether someone would be a good tenant. The Maine Affordable 
Housing Coalition have found that in Maine “it is not possible to definitively know whether 
the tenant was actually forced to vacate the unit,” “whether the tenant actually retained or 
lost possession of their home,” or in a dismissed case “whether that happened because the 
tenant paid the rent that was owed, the tenant vacated in order to avoid going to court, or 
for some other reason.”44 The American Bar Association recently adopted a resolution that 
notes that “[m]any landlords automatically decline rental housing to applicants with records 
of being sued for eviction—even if the cases were dismissed or otherwise resolved in favor 
of the tenant—and substantially all landlords treat such applicants less favorably. This 
practice incentivizes tenants to move out before an eviction case is filed, even when tenants

have meritorious defenses—a dynamic that undermines the fundamental legitimacy of the 
judicial forum.”45 Furthermore, eviction records do not show that corporate landlords file 
evictions at “substantially higher” rates because they use evictions as a rent collection 
strategy, nor do they point out that they “may not be indicative of tenant behavior and 
instead may reflect power imbalances between landlords and tenants, and even reinforce 
discriminatory or illegal actions by a prior landlord.”46 What studies show is that many 
landlords look at the existence of an eviction record as evidence of wrongdoing, regardless 
of the basis or legal outcome.47 The unreliable nature of eviction records and the unfairly 
narrow picture they present is well documented and make clear why they should not be 
used to unfairly deny Mainers a home.
Tenant Screening Companies Use of Eviction Records Is Discriminatory
Disparate impact discrimination occurs when protected classes suffer disparate outcomes 
from seemingly neutral policies, i.e., a landlord’s policy to deny applicants with eviction 
records. Regardless of a landlord’s intent, a policy of refusing to rent to tenants with 
eviction records disparately impacts non-white tenants, women heads of household, and 
families with children. Such policies can shift low-income tenants into substandard housing 
in poor neighborhoods and perpetuate segregation, which works against our national fair 
housing laws that envision communities with truly integrated and balanced living patterns.
Currently, 90% of landlords in the United States use reports from tenant screening 
companies to determine whether to accept or reject an applicant.48 Tenant screening 
companies use court records, that as mentioned above are unreliable, to create their reports. 
However, it is well documented that these companies are neither careful nor judicious in 
gathering and analyzing information for their reports.49 In fact, the federal agency 
responsible for regulating these companies stated in 2021 that “[c]omplaints about 
‘incorrect information on your report’ have represented the largest percentage of consumer 
complaints received by the Bureau regarding credit or consumer reporting each year for at 
least the last five years.”50 The opaqueness of the tenant screening companies’ methods of 
analyzation means that it is extremely unclear how these companies create their scores and 
ratings of potential tenants.51 Many times the scores and ratings are not even accompanied 
with the records used to create the rating, but landlords still rely on these scores and ratings 
to deny or accept an application.52

while landlords are represented 81%, and when a renter does not have representation they are often unable to 
“make legal arguments, raise applicable defenses, respond to or raise objections, introduce evidence, preserve 
issues for appeal, or navigate the procedural obstacles of litigation.” ACLU, NO EVICTION, supra note 7, at 3.

What is known is that these companies often use partial or incomplete names (also known 
as “wildcard” or “name-only” searches), partial or incomplete dates of birth, and automated 
systems with negligible human oversight that err in including too much rather than 
excluding errors.53 Wildcard or name-only matching searches affect people of color 
disproportionately because minority groups tend to have fewer surnames.54 For example, 
around 12 million Latinos and Latinas share just 26 surnames.55 This means that when 
partial, or even full, name searches are made, minority groups are more likely to be rejected 
for faulty or inaccurate information.56 This has become such an issue that the Bureau of 
Consumer Financial Protection had to publish a notice stating that name-only searches do 
not satisfy the legal standard created by the Fair Housing Act and other reporting laws. 
However, in that same notice, the Bureau noted that in spite of enforcement actions and 
court decisions, “it appears that some consumer reporting agencies continue to use [these] 
matching practices that do not satisfy the standard.”57 Use of unreliable eviction records 
within unknown and unreliable analyzation methods leads to disparate impacts on 
communities of color, women, and children and unfair practices towards all renters. 
Mainers should not have to suffer this. 
Conclusion
Maine Equal Justice hopes the Committee will vote ‘ought to pass’ on LD 557. “Studies 
have shown that exclusion from housing due to prior evictions plays a role in reinforcing 
stigmas, contributing to cycles of homelessness, causing mental and physical health issues, 
and preventing equitable wealth-building opportunities.”58 With an eviction crisis looming, 
or perhaps already here, and with the costs to individuals and society because of evictions 
soaring, there is no reason any Mainer should be unfairly denied housing and left with 
nowhere to go.
