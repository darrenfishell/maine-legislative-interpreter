LD 557
Chair Carney, Chair Moonen, and distinguished members of the judiciary committee,
My name is Phoebe Dolan, I live in Swanville, Maine and I am the director of Maine 
Youth Power, a youth-led, youth movement throughout rural and suburban Maine 
fighting to win human dignity, equity and a livable future for all. I am here today to 
ask that you support Representative Rana’s bill,  LD557 “An Act to Decrease 
Discrimination Based on Evictions in Housing Applications.”
Everyday I work with young Mainers, mentoring them to use the agency they have in their 
lives to make positive impacts on their own communities and across the state. I listen to all 
the struggles and problems that come up for young people daily. Housing is a large concern 
for many young people in Maine including myself. Trying to keep young people in Maine, as 
our state ages is vital to the future of the state. 
Eviction based discrimination when young people with eviction histories or any Mainer with a 
mixed renting history is wrong. Housing is not a privilege, it’s a human right. 
I am here today to deeply ask that you stand with young Mainers and housing insecure 
people by supporting LD557 and make Maine a better place to live. 
Thank you for your time.
