LD 557
Maine is in a housing crisis. Apartment owners provide housing. There is a legislative
onslaught against Apartment Owners that is just going to make the housing crisis 
worse by discouraging investment and discouraging small apartment owners.  This 
legislative onslaught will just increase homelessness in Maine and increase rents.   
The Legislature needs to work with, not against, Apartment Owners to solve the  
housing crisis.   The Legislature needs to stop infringing on an Apartment Owners 
property right to manage their property and protect their good tenants.
LD 557 is a bad idea for landlords/property managers.  Not being able to ask about 
prior evictions on a housing application will make it more difficult for landlords to 
make informed decisions about potential tenants. Knowing about prior evictions is an 
important factor in determining whether a tenant is likely to be a reliable tenant who 
pays rent on time and takes care of the property.
It's crucial for lawmakers to work collaboratively with apartment owners to develop 
solutions to address the housing crisis that do not unfairly burden or harm them.
