LD 557
I am writing in support of LD557, an Act to decrease discrimination based on evictions in 
housing applications. 
Maine does not currently protect against no cause evictions, which inevitably discriminates 
against our most financially vulnerable population, often causing a ripple affect that can force 
them into homelessnessâ€¦often through no fault of their own.
