As a smaller landlord, I don't have unlimited resources to support my family or 
refurbish a damaged rental.  It is very important that I screen and select good tenants.  
I personally have never evicted a good tenant.  I  want someone who will pay their 
rent each month, not perform criminal acts in my building, and have respect for the 
property and rules in the lease to provide safe and sanitary housing for everyone 
living in my building.   I feel if someone has been evicted, they should have every 
right to have a conversation and share their side of the story.  If someone was evicted 
for reasons other than the above, I would certainly consider them as potential tenants. 
The reason for the eviction would have an impact on my decision more than just the 
fact they were evicted.
