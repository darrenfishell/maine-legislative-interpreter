Senator Chlpman, Representative W11l1ams, and the honorable members of the Transportat1on 
COII1II1llI66 My name IS Cole Cochrane, I am a semor at Thornton Academy in Saco, and I am 
the Policy Director at Maine Youth Actlon, whlch 1s a statewide youth advocacy group that 
represents hundreds o\f young Mainers on critical issues facing us Mame Youth Action 1s 
testlfymg in support of LD 408, An Act to Estabhsh a “No Fare for Cleaner Au” Law in Mame
\ 
I have expressed these sentiments in ll11S committee before, but I would like to reiterate themm 
my testimony\ 
The youth of our state face numerous challenges given om" current transportation 
system F1ISlZ and foremost, my generation W111 be facing the brunt of the climate crisis We Wlll 
have to deal with a Cl1I'6 reahty that includes enviromnental degradation, signiﬁcantly reduced 
quahty of life, and a tumultuous economlc outlook As you all are probably aware of, the climate 
crisis 1s fueled by our greenhouse gas emissions, and in Mame, 54% of €II11SS1OI1S come from the 
transportation sector (1) T1118 IS heavily driven by our dependence on cars and promotion of car 
centric infrastructure, Wh1Cl1 has resulted in 78% of Mainers commutmg to work 111 a car alone 
(2), the highest ermttmg mode of transportatlon. However, the challenges We face are not simply 
from the effects of climate change Our current dependence on cars inhibits transportatlon access, 
whlch prevents young Mamers from accessing better _]0b opportunities, higher education and 
overall mobility Furthermore, if my generation actually does have access to a car, the costs 
associated with car OVV116l‘Sh1p are signiﬁcant In fact, accordmg to AAA, the average costs tend 
to be $894 monthly (3) If one was to work at the state’s minimum wage for 40 hours/week for 
52 weeks/year, this means that over 37% of one’s income is going towards transportation To put 
that m perspective, experts widely deﬁne affordable transportation as 20% of one’s mcome (4)

It’s clear that this is not the case for roughly 79;000 Mainers, who work between minimum wage 
and $14.99 hourly (5) 
Overall, these challenges are signiﬁcant for my generation and require action ﬁrom the 
legislature. Policy making of today will impact the reality of tomorrow Therefore, LD 408 
works towards addressing these challenges By havnig the state cover fare expenses for 
commuters, it frstly advances our climate goals Public transit is a key strategy in reducing 
emissions In fact, as a member of the Transportation Working Group on the Mame Climate 
Council, we identiﬁed in our ﬁnal strategy that we need to expand the state’s funding for public 
transportation services, which can be found on page 31 of the report (6). Zero fares means that 
pubhc transit will most definitely be used more. For example, in the city of Denver they 
implemented zero fares and their ridership increased by 36%, which ultimately reduced 
emissions Now, with respect to other challenges, zero fares mean that my generation (and' 
certainly many other Mamers) will have access to a highly affordable mode of commute. This 
drives down transportation costs and starts to break down the barriers of access Although there 
are certainly other measures this committee needs to take in order to improve public transit, LD 
408 is a signiﬁcant step in the right direction of reforming our current transportation system 
Therefore, I urge the committee to vote “ought to pass” on this bill Thank you for your tnne and
