Before the Joint Standmg Commlttee on Transportatlon 
May 11, 2023 
Representatlve W1ll1ams, and D1st1ngu1shed Members of the J o1nt Standmg Commlttee on 
Transportatlon, my name 1s Senator Ben Ch1pman I represent Senate D1str1ct 28, Wl"l1Chl11Cll.lCl6S 
a part of Portland I am here to present LD 408, “An Act to Establ1sh a “No Fare for Cleaner A1r” 
Law 1n Ma1ne” 
Th1s leg1slat1on would provlde free bus fares across the state to 1ncent1v1ze res1dents to use 
publlc transportat1on W1th1n the l1m1ts of avarlable fundlng, the Department would cover the 
cost of all publ1c bus serv1ce fares for transportat1on provlders under locally coordlnated plans 
for reg1onal trans1t 
In order to address the current cllmate cr1s1s, we need to 1ncent1v1ze methods of travel that are 
less harmful for the env1ronment As of February 2022, the U S Department of Transportat1on 
reported that about 49 percent of men and 51 percent of women are hcensed dnvers 1n Ma1ne 
About 77 8 percent of the total populatlon of our state—]ust over one m1ll1on people—are 
dnvers 54 percent of all greenhouse gas em1ss1ons 1n Ma1ne come from transportatlon In s1mp1e 
terms, we are a dr1v1ng state To protect the envlronment, 1t 1s 1mportant that we work to lmprove 
access1b1l1ty for publ1c trans1t 
A s1m1lar 1n1t1at1ye Was slgned lnto law 1n Colorado launch1ng “Zero Fare for Better A1r” dur1ng 
the month of August wh1ch 1s the month they have the hlghest ozone levels Reglonal Transport 
D1str1ct (RTD) 1n Denver partlclpated 1n thls program w1th great success R1dersh1p mcreased by 
22 percent 1n July 2022 and rncreased by 36 percent 1n August 2022 when there were no fares 
compared to the year before 
In Mame, bus serv1ce has expanded greatly over the last decade Much of Greater Portland 1s 
comected by vanous bus routes, 1nclud1ng much of Westbrook and Falmouth Express servlces 
also cormect the commun1t1es of Gorham, Yarmouth, Freeport, and Bnmsw1ck When more 
resldents use bus serv1ce rather than personal vehlcles, we are cuttmg our carbon em1ss1ons 
Publ1c trans1t 1s not _]l.1S'[ good for the enlrvonment, but 1t 1s also good for our commun1t1es Many 
Malners can’t dr1ve, whether 1t be that they don’t have a l1cense or they can’t afford to buy and 
ma1nta1n a vch1cle Publ1c trans1t 1s a cr1t1cal part of 1mprov1ng the l1ves of every member of our

commumty However, the fare for bus serv1ce can be a barner for many In Mame, we are 
already worklng to expand access1b1l1ty Bus fares of the Metro pub11c trans1t system have been 
halved for the rest of the year Th1s b11l would establ1sh a permanent, statewlde, and more 
access1bly vers1on of th1s program that already 6X1S'£S Let’s ensure that every Mamer has access
