Last year, the l-30¢‘ Legislature passed my bill, LD 679, An Act To Establish a Statewide Electronic E~ 
Warrant System. The beneﬁt of an Electronic Warrant System is that requests for warrants ;a_ re no' 
longer be delayed because of geography, or the physical movement of a paper document. 
As the ’Judicial§Branch implemented the Electronic,Warrant system, they found another statutethat, . 
would beneﬁt -from similar updating- . Current law requires judicial reviewof involuntary rnental- -health 
commitment applications, in theformi of original documents or afax of those documents. This' 
_-
. 
legislationproposesto updatethat law to also allow for electronic review. This change does not 
substantively change the review process, itis simply an update to allow for currentbest practice ofA 
document transmission. Electronic transmission of docuinentsis the most common method of sharing 
information, and can.be through secure means. This change will save time and resources for everyone. 
I thank you for your con' si:deration»of_this bill, and suggest you reserve questions for Julie Finn, of the 
Judicial Branch.I
