Judicial Branch testimony in favor of LD 459, An Act to Update the 
Procedures for Issuance of Orders Related to Involuntary Hospitalizations:
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony in support of this Judicial Branch bill. 
The 130th Legislature enacted and funded LD 679, now PL 2021 chapter 684, An Act to 
Establish a Statewide Electronic Warrant System. The Judicial Branch would like to thank 
Senator Lisa Keim who sponsored the bill in the last session. As a result of this and other recent 
developments, we have been examining processes and statutes to determine where electronic 
transmission of documents may be appropriate, especially outside of courthouse hours.
The current statute governing applications for involuntary mental health commitments 
permits judges to review only the original application or a facsimile transmission. LD 459 
provides the Judicial Branch with the ability to send and receive documents involving 
involuntary mental health commitments and hospitalizations by electronic methods. As you can 
see in the legislation, the only changes to Title 34-B, section 3863(3) that we propose are to add 
the possibility of electronic transfer of information in these emergency proceedings, where time 
is of the essence and technology can save time and resources for everyone involved.
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer your questions.
