In
support
of
LD
1274:
An
Act
to
Increase
Land
Access
for
Historically 
Disadvantaged
Populations.
Thank
you,
Chair
Ingwersen
and
Chair
Pluecker ,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the 
Committee
On
Agriculture,
Conservation,
and
Forestry
My
name
is
Angie
T ehuitzil,
I
live
in
Farmington,
Maine,
and
I
work
at
Maine
Y outh
Power
as
a 
legislative
fellow .
W e
are
a
youth-led
youth
movement
in
Maine
that
engages
youth
to
fight
for 
their
and
others'
future
by
focusing
on
bringing
greater
success
in
Maine.
I
am
here
today
to
ask 
that
you
support
Senator
Hickmanâ€™ s
bill
LD
1274:
An
Act
to
Increase
Land
Access
for 
Historically
Disadvantaged
Populations.
While
I
live
in
Maine
alone,
I
do
come
from
a
long-line
family
of
Hispanic
farmers,
some
out
of 
the
country
and
others
from
T exas
who
enjoy
what
they
do.
Similarly ,
I
have
realized
that
Maine 
also
has
a
proud
farming
community
that
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
state's
economy .
For
Maine
to 
keep
flourishing
we
must
now
provide
the
opportunity
for
all,
especially
motorized
groups
to 
have
access
to
land.
Everyone
should
be
aware
of
America's
truth
being
built
through
unfair
colonization
and
slavery . 
For
decades
America
didn't
permit
land
access
to
any
race
or
ethnicity
other
than
white.
While 
we
can't
fix
the
past,
we
can
make
the
present
better;
America
is
made
up
of
a
wide
range
of 
people
in
which
all
should
be
equal.
Currently ,
many
farm
owners
rely
on
migrant
farmworkers
to
contribute
to
harvest
crops
and
the 
agricultural
wealth
of
Maine.
The
continued
racial
disparities
can
be
observed
in
Maine's 
agriculture,
due
to
not
taking
action
on
the
barriers
that
have
caused
the
decline
in
diverse 
farmers.
According
to
the
census
of
agriculture,
out
of
the
3.4
million
farmers,
roughly
7%
are 
Black
or
people
of
color .
Maine
holds
a
lot
of
immigrants
that
are
eager
to
be
a
part
of
Maine 
agriculture
and
with
open
land
and
training
can
serve
successful
farmers
in
the
state.
Members
of
the
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation,
and
Forestry ,
I
ur ge
you
to
support
LD 
1274,
an
incredible
bill
that
we
want
to
see
pass
and
will
establish
a
way
for
Black
and
other 
socially
disadvantaged
groups
to
be
granted
land
to
farm
on
in
Maine.
In
order
to
keep
the
state 
thriving
we
need
to
encourage
more
diversity
to
move
to
Maine,
which
means
we
must
make
all 
feel
equal.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
