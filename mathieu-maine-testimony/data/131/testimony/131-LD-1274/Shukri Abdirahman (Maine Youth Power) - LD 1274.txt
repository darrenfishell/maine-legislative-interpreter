Chair lngwersen and Chair Pluecker and the distinguished members of the Committee On Agriculture,

equity and a livable future for all. I am here today to ask that you support Senator Hickmanâ€™s bill LD 
I274 An Act to Increase Land Access for Historically Disadvantaged Populations. 
I come from a background of parents who farmed and dependent on their land and what they could 
grow. I believe all Mainers, especially Bipoc people should be able to farm freely and enjoy the 
beautiful land we have here in Maine to sustain. I believe Maine has a responsibility to grant land to 
Black farmers who live here today. There has been along enough history of land dispossession 
coming from the history of slavery in our country. We must take this crucial step to enact a program 
to train and grant land to Black farmers to keep Maine the beautiful farming community and grow 
equitably. 
I strongly support this bill because I believe this bill will allow us to somewhat correct an injustice 
done to black farmers and to grant them the same opportunity white farmers in Maine enjoy. People 
often talk about how there's not enough black people in Maine but we don't even grant land access to 
black farmers we have here already. It is up to us to correct our history and to allow black farmers the 
same privileges as white farmers. Maine is an incredible state to live in and we are fortunate to have 
land we can grow, sustain and cherish. 
l believe this is an especially important bill and I urge the committee on Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry to pass this bill.
