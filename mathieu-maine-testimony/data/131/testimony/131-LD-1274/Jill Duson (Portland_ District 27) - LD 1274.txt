 Testimony of Senator Jill Duson supporting LD 1274, “An Act to Increase Land Access for 
Historically Disadvantaged Populations” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
April 3, 2023 
 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and Distinguished Colleagues on the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Jill Duson. I represent Senate 
District 27, which includes parts of Westbrook and Portland. I am here to speak in favor of LD 
1274, “An Act to Increase Land Access for Historically Disadvantaged Populations.” 
 
Access to landownership is not equal. Historically, the Black community has been boxed out of 
access to landownership and bank loans. For Black farmers, their access has been even more 
limited.  
 
Since the first white settlers landed on the shores of the Americas, Indigenous communities have 
been driven from their land through forced removal. Landownership was a defining 
characteristic of wealth and power. Those who did not own land were at an inherent 
disadvantage. Gatekeeping Black and Indigenous people from owning land was a way of 
perpetuating systemic racism.  
 
This legislation will directly address this chronic issue by providing an equitable funding and 
apprenticeship program specifically for Black and Indigenous farmers. By offering a direct 
pathway to landownership, we would be continuing our ongoing efforts to combat systemic 
racism.  
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
