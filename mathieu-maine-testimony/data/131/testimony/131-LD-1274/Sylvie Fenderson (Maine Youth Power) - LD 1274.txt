Chair Ingwersen and Chair Pluecker and the distinguished members of the Committee
On Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry,
My name is Sylvie Fenderson. I was born in Freeport, I’m 23 years old, and have 
been working on farms in the midcoast area for the past three years. The farmers I get 
to work with every day, have a first-hand understanding of the ways that the 
economy, the environment and our communities are deeply interdependent. All three 
must be healthy for the others to thrive. This is why I’m writing to you today to ask 
that you support LD1274 An Act to Increase Land Access for Historically 
Disadvantaged Populations.  This bill centers a lens of equity so that our Maine 
communities can be strong to face an often uncertain future together. 
Our country and state have a long shameful history of racially motivated land 
dispossession by the state both through violent settler colonialism against Indigenous 
Peoples and through the institution of slavery. This history is felt in the present 
moment by Black and Indigenous people today in many different ways but lack of 
generational wealth because of centuries of oppression is a key barrier that creates 
inequitable access to resources and land here in the state. Land access is crucial in 
starting any agricultural enterprise and provides personal independence and dignity. 
Because of the ways the nation was built, land access is more difficult for some and I 
believe that is wrong. This bill takes a step towards removing that barrier and gives 
our communities a way forward that cares for the past and focuses on building a 
thriving future.
Please vote in support of LD1274 An Act to Increase Land Access for Historically 
Disadvantaged Populations. 
Thank you for time in reviewing this testimony
