Chair lngwersen and Chair Pluecker and the distinguished members of the Committee On Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry 
My name is Rayna Palm. Hive in Swanviile, Maine and lam here today to ask that you support Senator 
Hickman's bill LD 1274 An Act to Increase Land Access for Historically Disadvantaged Populations. 
lam here because it is time that we are on the right side of history! Yikes! Why are we even still here? 
l believe Land Access can truly change everything. To finally increase Land Access is to honor the 
struggles and history of the Black community. We have all seen the atrocities of slavery, red lining, 
broken promises, lynchings, and many many more ghastly oversteps of rightful human boundaries. it 
is time to show the historically marginalized community that we care that our collective history does 
not represent the future. Land Access is access to Equality, to Culture, to Healing, and to being able 
to provide for oneself, one’s family and one's community. lt is the ability to access intergenerational 
wealth and to not struggle for security day by day. l live with access to wild spaces and farmland andl 
am grateful for that privilege. I wish for everyone to have the possibility to raise a family in peace, to 
be able to watch the birds‘ yearly migrations from their back porch, and to have the awe of raising 
good food and the community you can build around it. 
As a young Mainer, an Asian—American woman, and a gardener, l urge you to support Senator 
Hickman's Bill LD l27li An Act to Increase Land Access for Historically Disadvantaged Populations. 
Thank you for listening, 
Rayna Palm
