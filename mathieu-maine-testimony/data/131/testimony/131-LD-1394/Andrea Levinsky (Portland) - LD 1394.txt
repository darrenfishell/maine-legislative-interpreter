I am writing to express my support of LD 1394 “An Act to Expand and Strengthen 
the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program.” As a high school educator who helps 
students learn about career paths, I often tell students about this program. It makes a 
huge difference in their ability to access an education. When I try to refer students to 
this program, it has sometimes been full for months or even years. Having the 
program be consistently funded would help students be able to better plan for their 
educational pathway, knowing that this resource would be available to them. I am not 
aware of many other scholarships that help students with necessities like 
transportation and childcare. Because of the eligibility requirement around having a 
household income of less than 200% of the federal poverty level, this program is able 
to target the people who need it the most. The CSSP program has a huge potential to 
help strengthen Maine's workforce and help people get high-wage in demand jobs that
may not otherwise. Thank you for your consideration. These views are my own and 
are not representative of my employer.
