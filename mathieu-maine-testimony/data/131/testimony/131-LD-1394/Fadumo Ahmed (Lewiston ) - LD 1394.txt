Hello, my name is Fadumo Ahmed, and I am a member of the Community Youth 
Coalition. I am here to testify in support of this bill. Gateways help new immigrants 
with mental health services, translators, jobs, case workers, medical care, youth 
leadership, and help homeless immigrants. Expanding the funding of CSSP would 
impact not only immigrants but teens as well. CSSP provides cash assistance for 
childcare, prerequisite training, books, supplies, and remedial. My mother was a 
refugee who left Somalia in 2006 because of the ongoing wars. She thought once she 
came to America that everything would be okay, and she wasn't going to worry 
anymore, but she was wrong. Once she arrived, she received no help and couldn't ask 
for any help because of the language barrier. She was a single mother and was 
pregnant at the time. She worked two jobs to afford rent and food to eat. In her work 
life, she was always judged because she was a refugee. People thought she didn't do 
anything and thought low of her, but she was knowledgeable and worked diligently. 
Soon people acknowledged her skills and would ask her for help. People from other 
countries are educated and can bring new ideas, and they have an experience unlike 
ours. Expanding CSSP gives a fresh start to new immigrants. It also allows them to 
train for jobs with high-paying careers and will enable them to live high-quality lives. 
My mother was always working to provide for my siblings and me, so I didn't get to 
spend much time with her, but this bill will enable more family time for teenagers. If 
this bill is based, it will diversify Maine's clean energy workforce.
