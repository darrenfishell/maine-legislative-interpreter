LD 1394
Hello, my name is Samiira Noor and I am honored to be here to testify in support of 
LD 1394 - An Act to Expand and Strengthen the Competitive Skills Scholarship 
Program. As a member of Gateway Community Services Maine, I have seen firsthand
the struggles that our communities face when trying to access good jobs in high-need 
areas.At just seventeen years old, I may not have as much experience as some of the 
other speakers here today, but I can speak to the importance of this bill from the 
perspective of the populations that Gateway serves. Our organization provides 
resources and support to low-income and marginalized individuals, including 
immigrants, refugees, and people of color, who face significant barriers to accessing 
good jobs in Maine.One of the biggest barriers that our communities face is a lack of 
access to education and training. Many of the jobs in high-need areas, such as union 
careers in clean energy construction trades, require specialized training and 
education.However, the cost of education and training can be prohibitive for 
low-income individuals, and financial aid programs often do not cover the full cost of 
tuition and other expenses. This is where LD 1394 comes in.By expanding and 
strengthening the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program, LD 1394 will provide 
critical financial support to individuals seeking education and training in high-need 
areas. This program will enable individuals to acquire the skills and credentials 
necessary to secure good jobs with family-sustaining wages, while also supporting the
growth and development of Maine's economy.
