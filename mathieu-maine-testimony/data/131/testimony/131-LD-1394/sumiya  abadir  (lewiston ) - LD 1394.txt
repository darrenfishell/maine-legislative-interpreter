hello, my name is sumiya abadir, and i am among the members of the Community 
Youth Coalition. I am writing this to testify in regards of supporting this bill. Gateway
is known for helping bring in new immigrants and supporting them with translators, 
case workers, youth leadership, mental health services, and many more. CSSP not 
only provides perquisite training, it also provides cash assistance for the youth, 
supplies, and books. With the expansion of the funding of CSSP, it  would not only 
impact immigrant, but teens as well who are less fortunate. People, like my parents 
were refugees who left kenya in 2005 because of the constant wars. My parents had a 
vision that once they came to America, all their problems would disperse. after their 
arrival, they had trouble finding help mainly because of the language barrier and 
coudnt communicate well with people simply because they didn’t understand. My 
father struggled to find a job who would accept him as a human and not another 
refugee who is helpless and not qualified to be working. My father was a very smart 
man but didn’t have much resources to further his intelligence. people from other 
countries are always eager to bring new ideas but that can’t happen if their aren’t any 
resources or opportunities for that to happen. with the expansion of CSSP, it will give 
immigrants a new start it and enable them to go train for jobs with high paying careers
and live the life’s that they weren’t given prior to coming to America. if this bill is 
passed, it will give family’s more quality time and teenagers to spend more time with 
their loved ones instead of their parents balance family time and working trying to 
provide for the family. furthermore, this bill will diversify Maines clean energy 
workforce.
