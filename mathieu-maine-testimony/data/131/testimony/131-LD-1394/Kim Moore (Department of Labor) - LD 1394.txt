Testimony of Kim Moore, Director, Bureau of Employment Services 
Maine Department of Labor 
Neither For Nor Against LD 1394, “An Act to Expand and Strengthen the 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Program” 
Before The Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
April 19, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing, my name is Kim Moore and I am the Bureau Director of Employment 
Services at the Maine Department of Labor (Department). On behalf of the Department, I am 
offering this testimony neither for nor against LD 1394. “An Act to Expand and Strengthen the 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Program. ” 
The success of Maine‘s economy is tied directly to the skill of our workforce and the creativity 
and innovation of our employers. The Competitive Skills Scholarship Program (CSSP) began in 
2008 to positively affect the skill of people in the workforce and to support employers ’ success. 
Passed with bipartisan support by the Legislature in 2007, CSSP provides support to adults with 
income below 200% of the federal poverty level to help them attend postsecondary education 
and training programs. CSSP assists with essentials such as tuition and fees not otherwise 
covered by ﬁnancial aid, books and supplies, transportation, childcare and, for those with income 
below 125% of the poverty level, a small stipend equal to one—third of the average 
unemployment beneﬁt. CSSP was established not only to help workers, but to help meet 
employers ’ needs for skilled labor. Thus, to be eligible for the program. workers must be training 
for high wage, in demand jobs. 
CSSP came at a critical point — when the program began in 2008, the Great Recession had just 
begun to be felt across the country. And in Maine, laid off and low-income workers were 
unlikely to ﬁnd sustainable new employment. CSSP provided an opportunity for them to train for 
good paying jobs that were in demand. 
Last year represented the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program’s (CSSP’s) ﬁfteenth year. 
Since inception, it has helped 3,219 low-income Mainers attain the skills necessary to thrive in 
our state’s economy and help meet employer demand for a well-trained workforce. CS SP 
increases an individual ’s ability to fully participate in Maine“ s workforce, to earn family- 
supporting wages. and to contribute more robustly to Maine' s economy by encouraging lifelong 
learning and credential attaimnent. Supporting individuals in continuing education and skill 
development increases their ability to support themselves and their families.

The Department recognizes that the workforce system, the needs and backgrounds of our 
applicants, and training modalities have changed over the past 15 years, and those changes 
require updates to CSSP. 
0 We agree that Registered Apprenticeship programs that meet the criteria of high wage/in 
demand jobs as outlined in Subsection 4 of CSSP statute (identiﬁed by the Center for 
Workforce Research and Infonnation as providing opportunity for employment in jobs 
with high compensation, recommended by the State Workforce Board, and approved by 
the Governor of Governor' s Designee) should be explicitly supported in the CSSP 
statute. The Department recommends an adjustment to the proposed language to specify 
the Registered Apprenticeship must be connected to employment in an occupation 
reﬂected on the approved high wage/in demand list. 
I The Department agrees certiﬁed pre-apprenticeship as an exceptional tool for participants 
who require an “on-ramp” to a Registered Apprenticeship. Our commitment to 
supporting the development of these on-ramps is reﬂected in the signiﬁcant investment in 
certified pre-apprenticeship programs across the state through Maine Jobs and Recovery 
funds. The Department recommends that pre-apprenticeship leading to a Registered 
Apprenticeship connected to employment in an occupation reﬂected on the approved 
high wage/in demand list for CSSP would be approved for applicants who, as part of their 
assessment, require “pre-requisite, developmental, English language learner, or refresher 
courses” as described in CSSP rule. 
0 The Department agrees credential translation/evaluation is an essential tool in assessing 
the background, experience, and credentials of foreign trained applicants and determine 
eligibility. Our recommendation would be to add this commitment to Sec. 5. 26 MRSA 
§2033, sub-§6, A, which details what the program must provide to participants. 
0 ln this same section, the Department is aligned with the addition of “costs of licensing or 
certification necessary to practice in an occupation for which the individual is qualified" . 
0 In this same section, the Department agrees that Registered Apprenticeship cormected to 
employment in an occupation reﬂected on the approved high wage/in demand list is 
eligible for the services identiﬁed during their period of classroom training. Registered 
Apprenticeship requires employment and, on-the-job learning in addition to classroom 
training. The Department agrees that after completing classroom training comiected toa 
Registered Apprenticeship, a re-assessment of ﬁnancial eligibility would be performed 
and, if ﬁnancially eligibility continues, supports would continue to be provided to the 
participant as needed through their on-the-job leaming. 
While the Department does agree with some of the elements of this bill and provides 
recommendations to further strengthen those elements, we oppose the increase to .O4% of the 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund planned yield. CSSP is funded through assessments on 
Maine employers who contribute to the unemployment Trust Fund. An employer ’s 
unemployment tax is reduced by the amount paid into CS SP, as required by Maine statute. It is 
estimated that starting in 2024, the increase in funding for CSSP would increase by $5.0 million 
and increase incrementally as the ratio of total to taxable wages increases. Based on mildly 
ﬂuctuating contributions received and beneﬁts paid, the reduced contributions to the trust fund 
could cause a schedule change within ﬁve years.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration of my testimony. I would be happy to try 
to answer any questions you may have and will be available for the work session. 
The Maine Department of Labor is committed to serving the state' 
s workers and businesses by he/ping employers 
recruit and train a talented workforce. providing workers with skills needed to be competitive. assisting individuals 
when jobs are lost. ensuring safe andﬁzir workplacesfor people on thejob, and conducting research and analysis of 
employment data to supportjoh growth.
