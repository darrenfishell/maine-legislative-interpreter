Testimony introducing 
LD 1394, "An Act to Expand and Strengthen the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program” 
Senator Peggy Rotundo 
April 19, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Ioint Standing Committee 
on Labor and Housing, my name is Peggy Rotundo and I represent Senate District 21, the City 
of Lewiston. I am here today to introduce LD 1394, "An Act to Expand and Strengthen the 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Program”. 
I am pleased to join you today to present legislation that I believe will help my 
constituents and yours build better, more sustainable lives, and make a long-term contribution 
to the growth of our economy. The CSSP is an integral part of our state's workforce system. It 
identifies workers with low Wages and irregular employment; provides them with the 
opportunity to be trained for high wage, high demand jobs; and supports them with the 
critical services they need like child care and transportation to be successful on their pathway 
to more sustainable employment. 
I often think that too much is made about disagreements that occur under this dome, 
and not enough about the many things we agree upon. 
I'm sure that most of us agree with the vision that "Maine people from all across the 
state will have access to an unmatched quality of life and good-paying jobs” as stated in 
Maine's 10-Year Economic Development plan. [i] 
And I imagine too that most share the broad bipartisan goal embedded in Maine law in 
2017 to committing us to a target of 60% of Mainers having post-secondary degrees or 
credentials of value by 2025. [ii] 
These broadly shared goals are what inspired me to propose the changes to the 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Program included in LD 1394. This legislation takes an 
important step toward realizing those goals for a group of Maine people who would be unable 
to gain an ”unmatched quality of life and a good-paying job” without this program. I hope 
that you will give this legislation the same strong support as the vision upon which it is based.

Here is the contribution that LD 1394 would make to Maine's workforce system. First, it 
would increase the amount of funds available to the CSSP by diverting just over $4 million 
that employers currently contribute to the unemployment insurance trust fund to the 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund instead. This provision would be cost neutral for Maine 
employers. 
Some may wonder whether Maine' s unemployment insurance trust fund could 
withstand such a loss especially after the recessionary impact of the pandemic. After looking 
carefully at this question myself, I am confident that it can. The balance in Maine's 
unemployment trust fund balance is currently just over $608 million and ranks as the fourth 
healthiest in the nation. Moreover, Maine employers are now paying unemployment taxes 
based on the lowest tax schedule under Maine law and enjoyed an aggregate tax reduction of 
nearly $24 million just last fall. This was made possible by Governor Mills’ decision to invest 
$382 million of federal Covid relief funding in our unemployment trust fund to prevent tax 
increases on Maine businesses during the pandemic. 
V\7hile it is possible, but by no means certain, that moving even this modest amount 
from the UI trust fund to the Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund may trigger a schedule 
change at some point in the future, any such increase is well worth the investment. The success 
and vitality of the CSSP enables the existence and continued creation of a qualified and able 
talent pool for all employers. Moreover, the CSSP has a positive impact on Maine's 
unemployment trust fund as unemployment rates are reduced by 25 to 45% for those with 
post-secondary degrees.[iii] It is worth remembering that this nexus between educational 
attainment and lower unemployment rates was an especially important consideration to 
lawmakers when the CSSP was first enacted in 2007. 
Importantly, I want to note that this strategy for diverting funds from the UI trust fund 
to another fund supporting education and training is not unique to Maine. Fifteen other states, 
including those as diverse as Texas, Nevada, Mississippi and New York currently use this 
same approach to support their workforce systems. 
Next, LD 1394 will help to support participants in Maine's registered apprenticeship 
and certified pre-apprenticeship programs by recognizing them as approved training 
programs, thus qualifying otherwise eligible participants for CSSP services. These 
apprenticeship programs prepare people for high wage / high demand jobs and typically result 
in longer term tenure with the employers who hire these apprentices. Importantly, Maine's 
Department of Labor is making a strong effort to diversify these opportunities by promoting

them to low wage workers, single parents, immigrants and other marginalized 
populations. Critical supports like child care, transportation, and other work-related expenses 
are 
particularly important to these communities and will help make apprenticeships more 
financially feasible for this increasingly diverse group of workers. 
Finally, LD 1394 will remove harmful barriers preventing some otherwise eligible 
people from even applying for the CSSP. CSSP applicants are required to provide educational 
transcripts and, if they have a credential from another state or country, often that must be 
formally evaluated to determine if it is marketable in Maine. These costs are steep and leave 
many, if not most, unable to even get in the door to make an application for the CSSP. 
Similarly, the sheer cost to obtain the licenses or certifications needed to work in the 
occupation for which the worker has been trained is incredibly daunting, and can be nearly 
unimaginable for someone who has not yet even received their first paycheck in their new 
occupation. 
We all know that a brighter future comes with higher skill and educational attainment. 
But for some, that opportunity cannot be realized without support like those provided by the 
CSSP. These supports are the glue holding together their hopes for a better life. For people 
facing challenging life circumstances, the support and resources provided by the CSSP makes 
the difference between seizing the opportunity for growth, or being left behind. 
Please join me in supporting LD 1394 to give more Maine people the opportunity to 
increase their economic security, share their true potential with their communities and 
contribute more fully to our state' s economy. Please remember the vision that we share for the 
wellbeing of Maine people, and join me in taking this important step toward reaching that 
goal. 
Thank you for the opportunity to present LD 1394 to you today and I would be glad to 
answer, or get you answers, to any questions you may have.
