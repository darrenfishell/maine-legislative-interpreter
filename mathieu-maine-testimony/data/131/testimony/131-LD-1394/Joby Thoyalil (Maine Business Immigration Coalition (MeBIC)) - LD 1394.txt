Good
morning
Senator
Tipping,
Repr esentativ e
Roeder ,
and
members
of
the
joint
standing
committee
on
Labor
and
Housing.
My
name
is
J ob y
Tho yalil
and
I
am
the
dir ector
of
the
Maine
Business
Immigration
Coalition
(MeBIC).
MeBIC
is
Maine’ s
onl y
r esour ce
dedicated
to
pr o viding
inf ormation,
education
and
adv ocacy
on
immigration
and
r elated
issues
fr om
the
business
and
economic
perspectiv e ,
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
1394.
As
y ou
w ell
kno w ,
Maine ,
lik e
so
man y
par ts
of
the
countr y ,
is
experiencing
a
shor t-
and
long-term
w orkf or ce
shor tage .
In
the
past
f e w
months,
since
I'v e
been
in
this
r ole ,
I'v e
spok en
to
Maine
emplo y ers
in
industries
ranging
fr om
health
car e ,
scientific
r esear ch,
and
technolog y
to
construction,
agricultur e ,
and
la w
enf or cement,
and
the
one
consistent
message
I
hear
is
that
the y
all
need
mor e
w ork ers.
In
2021,
MeBIC
helped
organize
nearl y
100
Maine
businesses,
chambers
of
commer ce ,
trade
associations,
and
higher
education
institutions
to
sign
onto
the
Maine
Compact
on
Immigration
1
urging
state
leaders
to
“adopt
policies
and
practices
to
help
Maine
become
a
destination
of
choice
f or
immigrants
to
the
U .S.
and
that
pr o vide
an
en vir onment
wher e
immigrants
can
r each
their
full
potential
in
our
state . ”
The
Competitiv e
Skills
Scholarship
Pr ogram
(CSSP)
is
a
tested
strateg y
that
helps
w ork ers
r each
their
full
potential
while
also
helping
emplo y ers
hir e
w ork ers
with
the
skills
the y'r e
seeking.
W e
full y
suppor t
expanding
CSSP
in
the
wa ys
that
ar e
en visioned
in
this
bill.
I
want
to
highlight
the
pr o vision
that
w ould
r emo v e
bar riers
to
CSSP
enr ollment
b y
co v ering
the
cost
of
cr edential
e valuation
and
educational
transcripts.
Man y
immigrants
ha v e
a pplicable
prior
skills
and
experience
that
could
help
meet
Maine's
cur r ent
labor
mark et
needs,
but
the y
face
the
bar rier
of
needing
their
f or eign
cr edentials
e valuated.
F or
example ,
to
a ppl y
f or
a
job
that
r equir es
a
master's
degr ee ,
immigrants
often
need
to
ha v e
their
f or eign
educational
cr edentials
translated

w w w . m a i n e b i c . o r g

if
not
in
English,
and
then
e valuated
b y
a
pr of essional
ser vice
to
establish
that
their
education
is
the
equivalent
of
a
U .S.
master's
degr ee .
This
can
cost
hundr eds
of
dollars
and
these
costs
cur r entl y
pr e v ent
some
w ork ers
fr om
using
existing
skills
to
incr ease
their
wages,
suppor t
their
families
and
contribute
full y
to
the
Maine
econom y .
Although
man y
immigrants
ar riv e
with
prior
skills,
f or
some ,
those
skills
don’ t
transf er
to
the
needs
of
the
Maine
labor
mark et,
and
so
I
want
to
also
highlight
our
suppor t
f or
expanding
CSSP
to
par ticipants
in
a ppr enticeship
and
pr e-a ppr enticeship
pr ograms.
Appr enticeships
ar e
a
pr o v en
car eer
pathwa y
wher e
emplo y ers
tak e
an
activ e
r ole
in
de v eloping
their
futur e
w orkf or ce
and
w ork ers
value
the
practical,
hands-on
experience
the y
can
get
fr om
these
pr ograms.
Pr e-a ppr enticeship
pr ograms
ar e
designed
to
pr epar e
individuals
to
enter
and
succeed
in
an
a ppr enticeship
pr ogram.
W e
especiall y
see
the
potential
f or
expanding
CSSP
to
pr e-a ppr enticeship
pr ograms
because
individuals
can
par ticipate
in
such
pr ograms
prior
to
r eceiving
f ederal
w ork
authorization.
As
I
kno w
this
committee
is
w ell
a war e ,
cer tain
immigrants,
including
people
seeking
asylum,
m ust
wait
man y
months
to
a
y ear
to
r eceiv e
w ork
authorization
fr om
the
f ederal
g o v ernment.
Asylum
seek ers
could
spend
that
time
taking
steps
to
get
r eady
f or
w ork,
including
par ticipating
in
pr e-a ppr enticeship
pr ograms.
Ho w e v er ,
without
an y
ability
to
earn
income ,
these
individuals
face
bar riers
to
par ticipation
that
CSSP
could
help
o v er come .
I
will
conclude
b y
urging
y ou
to
suppor t
LD
1394.
Our
ong oing
labor
shor tage
means
that
e v er y
ne w
w orking-age
r esident
who
mo v es
to
Maine ,
whether
fr om
acr oss
the
countr y
or
ar ound
the
globe ,
is
someone
Maine
needs
to
join
our
w orkf or ce
in
a
wa y
that
maximizes
their
potential
and
contributes
to
our
econom y .
CSSP
is
w ell
designed
to
help
mak e
that
ha ppen
and
LD
1394
will
significantl y
impr o v e
upon
that
design.
Thank
