LD 572
Dear Senate Chair Brenner, Representative Gramlich and Committee Members:
Please oppose LD 572. It is very disturbing and please consider the following 
questions I think the majority of Maine constituents and I ask:
1. Why is it an emergency to remove the opportunity for every Maine shopper to 
experience a few minutes of mindfulness before and during our shopping experiences 
within Maine’s borders?
2. Why is it an emergency to remove the opportunity for every Maine shopper to act, 
to contribute, to do our part day-to-day to help address the issue of plastic bags 
harming our environment and public health within, throughout and beyond Maine’s 
borders? 
3. Why is it an emergency to reverse Maine’s Dirigo/leading status among other states
by reversing our proactive role modeling for doing our part in addressing the problem 
of plastic pollution that already affects every constituent, our children and their 
children in your districts and across all state, federal and international boundary lines?
Please oppose this bill and any other bills that reverse Maine’s conscientious 
proactive environmental and public health efforts.
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration on behalf of all Maine and all global 
constituents.
Respectfully,
Kerry Sack
Old Town
