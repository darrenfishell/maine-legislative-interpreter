LD 572
Hello, Please register my opposition to LD 572, which seeks to strike down the ban 
on paying five cents for shopping bags at point of purchase. People have embraced 
bringing their own bags, and it is another in the small ways that Mainers have adapted
to reduce their waste stream. Single  use bags end up in landfills and as litter, even if 
people pay five cents for them. Mainers choose to sort their recyclables, compost, 
reuse products, reduce waste because they care about their environment. Why would 
we go back now? This bill addresses no emergency. This bill is of detriment to 
consumers who wish to clean up their communities. Reusing sturdy bags to to tote 
your groceries is not a burden, it is participation in the ways we can reduce pollution. 
Vote no on this bill. Thank you.
