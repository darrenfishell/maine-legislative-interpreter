gates.melissa@rocketmail.com  | 207.706.6378 1 March 1, 2023  Greetings Chair Brenner, Chair Gramlich, and Distinguished Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee:  I implore the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD425,1 An Act to Lower the Environmental Impact of Consumers, Increase Food Safety and Strengthen Consumer Choice by Ending the Ban on Single-use Plastic Shopping Bags, and LD572,2 An Act to Remove the 5 Cent Fee for Bags in Retail Stores.   Results from our region and across the globe demonstrate that where bag laws are enacted, there are clear decreases in both single-use carryout bag consumption and plastic litter-- without any significant burdens on residents or businesses in impacted communities.3 Maine’s bag law is an excellent example of working environmental policy that is having its intended effect of reducing pollution from single-use plastic and paper bags and encouraging consumers to bring their own reusable bags while shopping.  The removal of the currently required 5-cent fee for single-use paper and 4 mil plastic bags, as requested in LD572, would render Maine’s bag law ineffective and likely counterproductive.   To generate good bag policy, a mandatory fee on all bags provided at point of sale is required for a few reasons. While paper bags do not carry the same risk for persistent environmental harm when lost into the marine environment as plastic bags do, their use nevertheless incurs appreciable ecological costs and encourages the wasteful single-                                                1 LD425: https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0258&item=1&snum=131 2 LD572: https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0367&item=1&snum=131 3 “Plastic Bag Impact.” Mass Green Network, http://www.massgreen.org/plastic-bag-impact.html.; “Plastic Bag Bans: Analysis of Economic and Environmental Impacts.” Equinox Center, 2013.

Paper production, transport, and recycling are all energy and water intensive activities that result in non-negligible greenhouse gas and other harmful chemical emissions.   Having paper or plastic bags available for free leads shoppers to use them instead of reusable bags, and to treat them as single-use.4 Research has shown that even a modest charge per bag is critical to change consumer habit to reusable bags,5 as the option to avoid fees for single-use bags incentivizes shoppers to bring their own reusable bags.   Fees also help avoid a shift of the pollution problem from single-use plastic to paper or thicker plastic bags, and help businesses offset the costs of single-use bags or to recuperate all of their costs.   In practice, allowing 4 mil+ plastic bags for free as proposed would dramatically reduce the net environmental benefit -- or even render it counterproductive. When the City of Austin, Texas allowed 4 mil plastic bags to be considered reusable and given out for free, they saw a 5-fold increase in the discarding of these plastic bags, slashing an impressive 94% reduction in single-use plastic bag use down to a mere 24% net decrease in total plastic bag weight. This was with only one major grocery chain in the city electing to distribute thick plastic bags rather than recycled paper! 6   Interestingly, Connecticut also passed a bag law when Maine did, in 2019.7 However, when their law began banning single-use plastic bags under 4 mils in 2021 and allowed but did not require a fee for 4 mil+ plastic bags, Walmart and many other big grocers                                                 4 Vire, Kris. “Chicago’s plastic bag “ban” is so far a bust.” TimeOut Chicago, 2015. https://www.timeout.com/chicago/blog/chicagos-plastic-bag-ban-is-so-far-a-bust-090115. 5 Shampanier, K., Mazar, N., and Ariely, D. “Zero as a special price: The true value of free products.” Marketing Science, 2007, 26, 742. 6 Waters, Aaron.

In Maine, to the contrary, LD1532 was amended before it passed into law to include a fee not only on single-use paper bags but also on the allowable 4 mil plastic bags. As a direct result, Walmarts in Maine went bag-free.9 This was not an arbitrary decision but rather proof that our Maine bag law produced one of its intended results in reducing pollution from single-use plastic bags by incentivizing a retail giant not to provide them at all:  "With that ban soon taking effect, Walmart is converting all Maine stores to bagless on July 1," Charles Crowson, Walmart's communications director for the northern U.S., said in an email to USA TODAY.10  Fortunately, public outcry in Connecticut along with store cost savings from a decrease in bag consumption and successes experienced by Walmart with their bag-free protocols in Maine and the nations of Canada and Mexico, coupled with the threat of strengthened Connecticut bag legislation, has pressured the retail giant to go bag-free in Connecticut in 2023.11  Behavioral economics research in 201312 unveiled that higher and lower income consumers respond in different ways to fees. Low income consumers tend to reduce demand in response to both excise and sales taxes, whereas higher income consumers only reduce demand in response to excise taxes. For bag laws, this means that higher income shoppers tend to look at the price of items on the shelf but don’t pay attention to what they pay at the register, while lower income shoppers tend to pay close attention to item costs and the final total. For legislators who are rightfully concerned as grocery prices soar about the impact of bag fees on financially challenged                                                 8 News coverage: https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Environmentalists-call-thicker-Walmart-plastic-16320498.php 9 News coverage Fact Check: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/06/14/fact-check-maine-walmart-stores-going-bagless/7617508002/ 10 Ibid. 12 11 News coverage: https://patch.com/connecticut/across-ct/walmart-will-discontinue-paper-plastic-bags-ct-starting-wednesday 12 https://dataspace.princeton.edu/bitstream/88435/dsp01jw827b79g/1/Homonoff_princeton_0181D_10641.pdf

To build better equity into the existing law, adding a provision that exempts recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program (SNAP) and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits from the fee requirement would be a welcomed change; these benefits cannot be used to pay for reusable or single-use bags. Many local and state bag laws contain this exemption; pasted herein is text from California for your consideration: (d) Notwithstanding any other law… that makes reusable grocery bags or recycled paper bags available for purchase at the point of sale shall provide a reusable grocery bag or a recycled paper bag at no cost at the point of sale to a customer using a payment card or voucher issued by the California Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 123275) of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of Division 106 of the Health and Safety Code or an electronic benefit transfer card issued pursuant to Section 10072 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.13  Prior to the plastic bag law taking effect in our state, Maine law required stores that provided single-use plastic carry-out bags to customers to provide a receptacle either within the store or within 20 feet of its main entrance for return of those bags for recycling.14 Unfortunately, when this law was in effect without the prohibition on thin film single-use plastic bags under 4 mil and a fee required on all single-use paper and plastic bags 4 mil or more, as our bag law now requires, it was not effective at preventing needless plastic pollution from bags or in helping reclaim plastic bags used by customers. Even with attempts at signage and messaging, the receptacles alone failed to return appreciable benefits. This law was repealed and wrapped into LD1532, the bill before the 129th Legislature that was amended and passed into law15 to protect Maine people, wildlife, and environment from the may negative impacts of single-use plastic bags. But LD425 purports to take Maine back in time by repealing the bag ban                                                 13 CA bag law bill as chaptered: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB270 14 §1605.

Even if renewed efforts could ramp up education and public participation in returning used plastic bags for recycling, this would not stop the unjust and ecologically devastating production of single-use bags. Unjust, as the industrial facilities needed to produce and dispose of plastic to make single-use bags –fracking sites, petrochemical plants, landfills and incinerators– are disproportionately located around the U.S. in black and brown communities. 79% of U.S. incinerators are located in Black, indigenous and people of color communities.16 Black people in the U.S. bear a pollution burden of 56% (excess exposure compared to consumption) resulting from the poor air quality + increased health risk from living near a plastic production site.17   Ecologically devastating, as the massive and mounting breadth of scientific evidence around the globe demonstrates beyond doubt that plastics have a detrimental impact on human and animal health, water quality, and the planet, continuing to inspire governments at every scale to further reduce and ban wasteful single-use plastics.18  Ramping up recycling of plastic bags instead of continuing our working mitigation law to stop them from being produced, in the first place, would also not appease recycling facilities, like ecomaine, which testified on LD1532 that:  “plastic bags represent a highly prevalent material that is not easily recycled; it often ends up both as litter in our environment and as a nuisance material in recycling plants such as ecomaine’s. … As there are very limited markets and facilities to recycle this material, it is not economically feasible to sort and process these bags and films for a vast majority of MRFs. Furthermore, in the event that residents place plastic bags in their recycling streams, they can create significant problems at materials recovery facilities (MRFs) like ecomaine’s. Plastic bags and films wrap around the axles and gears of a MRF’s sorting                                                 16 http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d14dab43967cc000179f3d2/t/5d5c4bea0d59ad00012d220e/1566329840732/CR_GaiaReportFinal_05.21.pdf 17 https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1818859116 18 https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/plastic-planet-how-tiny-plastic-particles-are-polluting-our-soil#:~:text=Toxic%20effects&text=Chlorinated%20plastic%20can%20release%20harmful,species%20that%20drink%20the%20water.

machinery, costing valuable time, manpower, and expense to remove these non-recyclable materials so that our plants will sort those materials that are recyclable much more efficiently.”19  I hope that the Committee sees the many benefits of maintaining our bag law as it is and will vote Ought Not to Pass on LD425 and LD572, or will vote to improve our law by amending it to exempt people paying with SNAP, WIC and other benefits from bag fees, as many other states have done to good effect.
