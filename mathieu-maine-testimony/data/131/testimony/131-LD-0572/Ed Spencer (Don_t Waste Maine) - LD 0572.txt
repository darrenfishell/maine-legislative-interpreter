LDs 425 and 572 Opposition Testimony
Dear Chairs Brenner and Gramlich and Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
Don’t Waste Maine appreciates this opportunity to testify in opposition to both LD 425 and LD 572. The 
ban on single use plastic bags has been a real positive for the State of Maine and all Mainers. Many 
citizens had given up the use of throwaway plastic bags years ago, and now we have all adjusted our 
shopping habits to include reusable bags to transport our purchases. Most people realize that excess 
plastics in our environment can be harmful to human health and wildlife. 
For those of us who may forget our reusable bags, having to spend 5 cents to purchase a bag seems like 
a reasonable expense, especially since we all cooperate willingly with the Bottle Bill. Once in a while, 
buying a good, strong paper bag (hopefully made in Maine!) is a useful investment. 
We have successfully adapted to the current practices that LDs 425 and 572 seek to reverse. Doing so 
would come at a high social cost. Traveling elsewhere reminds us that Mainers care about controlling 
our waste inputs to our beautiful state. Perhaps there are easily biodegradable products that can 
replace single use plastics some day. Meanwhile, let’s defeat these Bills, instead of returning to the 
waste-full ways of the past!
Don’t Waste Maine is a citizens action group that supports waste policies that strengthen communities 
and protect the environment, with a focus on environmental justice.
Respectfully submitted,
Bill Lippincott and Ed Spencer, co-chairs DWME
