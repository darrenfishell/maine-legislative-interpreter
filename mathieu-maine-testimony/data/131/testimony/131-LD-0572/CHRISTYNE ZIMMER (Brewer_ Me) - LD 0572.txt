RE LD572, a 5 cent fee per plastic bag is NOT an economic burden as most everyone 
has become accustomed to providing their own reusable bags.  It has taken awhile to 
arrive at this adjustment in our habits which positively impacts our well-being, and 
we would do well to leave it in place.  For those who may forget to bring bags and 
find 5 cents burdensome, stores should provide a recycled bag bin for their use.  All 
proceeds from the sale of plastic bags should be set aside for funding the remediation 
of our soil, water and air which will be required sooner rather than later for health 
purposes, if we don't stop adding them to our waste stream.  Plastic recycling per 
current methods is incompatible with the health of our environment and bodies.  
Thank you for taking these comments into consideration.
