Neither for Nor Against  
 
LD 1880 , An Act to Amend the Adult Use Cannabis Laws  
 
May 8 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica  and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony neither for nor against  LD 1880  
on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee 
(LPC). Fo r reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position 
on bills of municipal interest.    
Municipal officials in Maine support the growing cannabis economy and the revenues that it has 
recently generated for our st ate. At the same time, local leaders are also attempting to manage the 
challenging effects of inflation and rising costs within their borders and those conversations are rising to 
the top of the list in terms of importance. With cannabis,  many officials ha ve expressed concerns with the 
enforcement aspect of on premises cannabis consumption  at social clubs and concerns for public safety 
with potential driver impairment . 
It's worth noting for the record that local leaders remain steady in their need for local  control and 
are not supportive of cannabis delivery services in municipalities that have not opted in to allow their 
operation in their communities.  
Thank you for  your time and for  considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
