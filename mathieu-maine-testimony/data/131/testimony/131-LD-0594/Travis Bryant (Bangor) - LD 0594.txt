Re:
LD
594,
An
Act
to
Address
the
Shortfalls
of
the
Current
Resource
Parents'
Bill
of
Rights 
Policy
Dear
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
the
esteemed
members
of
the
Health
and 
Human
Service
Committee,
My
name
is
T ravis
Bryant
and
I
am
responding
in
my
capacity
as
Executive
Director
of 
Adoptive
and
Foster
Families
of
Maine,
Inc.
&
The
Kinship
Program
(AFFM)
to
testify
in
favor 
of
LD
594.
Before
I
go
into
the
details
of
this
testimony
I
would
like
to
acknowledge
that
May
is
National 
Foster
Care
Month.
I
would
like
to
thank
the
1,661
foster
homes
that
are
currently
licensed
and 
providing
care
to
one
of
Maine's
most
vulnerable
populations
of
youth
24
hours
a
day ,
7
days
a 
week.
I
would
also
like
to
thank
all
families
who
previously
fostered
and
welcome
any
person 
who
is
thinking
about
fostering
or
wanting
to
be
involved
in
supporting
resource
families.
I 
would
like
to
thank
you
as
legislators
who
have
taken
the
time
to
speak
with
the
adoptive,
foster , 
and
kinship
caregivers
and
bring
attention
to
their
needs
in
an
ef fort
to
create
positive
outcomes 
for
youth
and
families.
AFFM
provides
peer
support
navigation
to
adoptive,
foster ,
and
kinship
caregivers,
also
known 
as
resource
families.
AFFM's
mission
is
to
provide
the
training,
guidance,
knowledge,
and 
resources
needed
to
handle
complex
issues
encountered
by
resource
families
as
they
open
their 
hearts
and
homes
to
children
in
need.
AFFM
works
closely
with
many
other
agencies, 
collaboratives,
and
committees
to
help
address
the
needs
of
resource
families
such
as
the;
Family 
Focused
T reatment
Association,
A
Family
For
Me,
The
Resource
Parent
Care
T eam,
The 
Resource
Parent
Advisory
Committee,
The
Kinship
Navigator
Advisory
Committee,
The
Y outh 
Leadership
Advisory
T eam,
The
Maine
Chapter
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
Foster
Care 
Committee,
the
University
of
Southern
Maine
Catherine
Cutler
Institute,
and
The
Of fice
of 
Child
Family
Services.
Though
many
others
also
support
resource
families
and
children
in
foster 
care;
the
or ganizations
and
collaboratives
mentioned
have
specific
missions
and/or
dedicated 
programs
that
support
resource
families.

Resource
families
call
AFFM
for
support
on
how
to
navigate
a
variety
of
situations,
services,
and 
systems.
Over
the
past
year
(5/1/22
to
4/30/23)
AFFM
staf f
have
directly
connected
with
910 
resource
parents.
Resource
families
are
an
important
lifeline
towards
increasing
the
chances
of 
positive
outcomes
for
children
and
parents
in
Maine
who
are
experiencing
very
dif ficult
and 
challenging
times.
It
is
essential
that
resource
parents
are
included
as
a
part
of
the
child’ s
team 
and
are
supported
by
the
team
to
do
so.
Child
welfare
is
fraught
with
highly
emotional
situations 
that
are
compounded
by
trauma,
neurodiversity ,
communication
barriers,
and
financial
stressors. 
T o
learn
more
about
the
specifics
of
these
dif ficulties
I
have
attached
a
copy
of
the
resource 
family
exit
survey
which
includes
the
feedback
from
about
144
resource
families
who
have 
exited
the
foster
care
system.
Some
of
this
information
dates
back
to
2020,
but
we
believe
there 
is
still
relevance
to
what
resource
families
are
facing
today .
Since
the
document
is
lengthy ,
I 
would
like
to
lift
up
a
few
resource
parent
quotes
from
it:
“Although
foster
parents
are
important,
and
necessary
to
the
system
as
is,
I
feel
there
are
too 
many
times
that
we
are
flattered
with
words
-
when
really
the
system
needs
to
change
to
be
better 
for
all
involved
(kids
mostly ,
but
also
bio
&
resource
parents).”
“Overall,
it
was
good.
W e
worked
with
some
great
caseworkers
and
some
not-so-great 
caseworkers.
AFFM
supported
our
family
in
many
ways
over
the
years
and
we
are
very
thankful. 
I’m
still
here
as
support
though
and
I
don’ t
think
I
will
ever
really
be
done
working
with
foster 
families
or
children.
W e
are
very
lucky
to
have
our
children
and
I
know
that
we
changed
some 
lives.”
AFFM
is
dedicated
to
supporting
resource
families
in
Maine
and
asks
for
the
committee
to
vote, 
ought
to
pass
on
LD
594.
Beyond
that,
AFFM
hopes
members
of
the
131st
legislature
continue 
to
consider
ways
to
elevate
the
need
to
support
resource
families
in
Maine
and
to
lean
into
the 
voices
of
resource
families.
I
thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
If
you
have
any
questions
regarding
my
testimony
or
support
for
resource
families,
please
