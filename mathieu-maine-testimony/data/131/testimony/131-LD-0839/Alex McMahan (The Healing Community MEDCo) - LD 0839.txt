Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs March 13th, 2023

Subject: Support of LD 839 
l’m here today to testify in support of LD 839. 
On-premises consumption of cannabis is undeniably necessary for one simple reason: if you 
want people to stop using cannabis in their cars, on the sidewalks, and in the parks, you have to 
give them a place to go. There’s a simple reason why people don’t rampantly drink alcohol in 
their cars, on the sidewalks, and in the parks. That reason is bars. Until there is a legal place for 
people to use cannabis outside of their private abodes, you will continue to see cannabis use in 
all sorts of public places. 
Adult use of cannabis was legalized in Maine via an act to regulate cannabis like alcohol. This 
will of the voters cannot be fully realized without the legalization of on-premises consumption. 
The adult use cannabis market has had ample time to mature, and it is now time to make this 
happen. 
I appreciate your time and consideration, as well as all your hard work on the many necessary 
changes to both cannabis programs this session. 
Respectfully,
