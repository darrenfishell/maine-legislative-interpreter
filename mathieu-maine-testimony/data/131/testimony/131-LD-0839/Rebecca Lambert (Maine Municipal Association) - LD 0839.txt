 
 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association  
 
Neither for Nor Against  
 
LD 839, An Act to Allow On -premises Consumption of Adult Use Cannabis and Adult Use 
Cannabis Products on the Premises of Cannabis Store Licensees  
 
March 13, 2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony neither for nor against  
LD 839 on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative 
Policy Committee (LPC). For reference , the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA 
and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Municipal officials in Maine sup port the growing cannabis economy and the revenues that 
it has recently generated for our state. At the same time, local leaders are also attempting to 
manage the challenging effects of inflation and rising costs within their borders and those 
conversation s are rising to the top of the list in terms of importance. While many officials have 
expressed concerns with the enforcement aspect of on premises cannabis consumption and 
driver impairment particularly when consuming edibles on premises, ultimately, officials are growing weary of the cannabis conversation.  
Leaders have also expressed frustration on the disparities of regulation between alcohol 
and cannabis.  Due to the illegality of cannabis at the federal level, these frustrations will continue 
until the time it is federally legal and those conversations can be had on a more level playing 
field.   
With that in mind, being thoughtful when considering  cannabis legislation, and keeping 
an eye towards consistency regarding regulation among all legal substances , would limit the need 
to make statutory changes  in the future,  if or when federal legalization should  occur.  
Thank you for  your time and for  considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
