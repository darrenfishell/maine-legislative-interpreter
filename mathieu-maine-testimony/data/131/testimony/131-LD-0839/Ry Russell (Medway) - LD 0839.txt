My name is Ry Russell and I represent Budz Emporium from Medway, Maine. In the 
last year our business has grown significantly. Customers come in from over an hour 
away because we provide an atmosphere that is welcoming and inviting. We have 
discovered that many of our guests like to hang out at the store and chit chat with the 
staff. Our customers are lonely and looking for an outlet to connect with others that 
isn't a bar. In my area we have more bars than we need and most recreational cannabis
users do not fit in the bar environment. We have no co-working spaces in our area and
ultimately no coffee shops. Options are sadly extremely limited for our customers. 
Loneliness is not good for anyone and we saw through the pandemic what isolation 
does to people. I think allowing consumption lounges means more than added revenue
or new venue for consumption, it means community. This proposal would allow 
people to meet others with similar interests and to help everyone feel less alone and 
disconnected from a community. Cannabis users need a safe space to consume, relax, 
and be part of a bigger community. I really hope we can all see the need for safe 
consumption spaces. I thank you for your time.
