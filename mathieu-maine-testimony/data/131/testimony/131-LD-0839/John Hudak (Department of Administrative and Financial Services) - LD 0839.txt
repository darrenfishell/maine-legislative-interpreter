Re: LD 839 —An Act to Allow On-premises Consumption of Adult Use Cannabis and Adult Use 
Cannabis Products on the Premises of Cannabis Store Licensees 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans 
and Legal Affairs: 
I am John Hudak, Director of the Office of Carmabis Policy (OCP) and I am before you today to 
provide testimony on behalf of the Administration neither for nor against LD 839. We Want to 
be supportive of the economic development opportunities presented by this expansion of the 
adult use cannabis program, but this bill as written is entirely inadequate to serve as the basis for 
establishing on-premises public consumption sites. We are raising these issues today with the 
hope that we can Work with this committee and the bill’s supporters to address the substantial 
structural concems that must be resolved for the successful implementation of on-premises 
consumptions and to gain the Administration ’s support. 
First, as you can see in written remarks from our colleagues at the Maine CDC, this bill simply 
does not address the serious public health and safety issues raised by permitting the public 
consumption of a substance that impairs critical thinking, memory, judgment, balance and 
coordination. Addressing these health and safety concems is a necessary first step to fixing the 
fundamental deficiencies in this bill. We wiH provide some recommendations for addressing 
these issues, but we expect that tackling these multifaceted challenges will require a holistic 
approach that draws upon the expertise of staff from our office, the Maine CDC, the Department 
of Public Safety, municipal officials, law enforcement, public health advocates and 
representatives from other jurisdictions that allow social consumption. We urge the committee 
not to rush this process and to rely on these experts in crafting an amendment to this bill. 
To address concems regarding over-serving consumers this bill should be amended to: 
0 Mandate the development and provision of safe vendor training for all employees where 
on-premises consumption is permitted; 
0 Such training should include training on recognizing consumer impairment, not 
the less stringent “visibly intoxicated ” standard. 
v Require limits on the amount of cannabis that can be served to an individual and prohibit 
serving an individual who is impaired, whether or not they appear visibly intoxicated; and 
I Assign liability to on-premises consumption site owners similar to dram shop liability in 
the alcohol industry.

To address concerns regarding driving under the inﬂuence of cannabis this bill should be 
amended to: 
0 Require additional funding for law enforcement training of Drug Recognition Experts; 
0 Require a speciﬁc public education program that addresses the fact that driving under the 
influence of cannabis is both dangerous and illegal; and 
0 Assign liability to on-premises consumption site owners similar to dram shop liability in 
the alcohol industry. 
To address concerns regarding insufficient public education and infonnation regarding the 
impacts of camiabis this bill should be amended to: 
0 Provide dedicated funding to support the Maine Prevention Network; and 
0 Provide funding and a clear mandate to the Maine CDC to review and monitor emerging 
research and science regarding camiabis and public health and make recommendations 
for health, education, and policy interventions to mitigate any public health risks. 
To address concems regarding employee safety issues related to indoor air quality: 
0 Prohibit smoking at on-premises consumption sites or require air purification equipment 
in order for these businesses to qualify for an exemption under the Workplace Smoking 
Act of 1985. 
If this committee can address the foregoing public health and safety challenges, any amendment 
must also deal with the substantial structural issues presented by this bill as drafted. Any 
amendment to this bill must take seriously the distinct challenges and opporttmities presented by 
this new authorized activity instead of shoehoming on-site consumption into the existing 
regulatory framework for cannabis stores. A thoughtful approach to implementing on-site 
consumption in law must include: 
0 Definition of new terms like “on-premises consumption ” , “on-premises consumption 
area” , and “on-site”; 
0 The process by which local govemments update or amend existing local regulations to 
opt-in to pemritting the operation of consumption sites; 
0 Whether consumption sites should be an additional authorized activity of existing 
cannabis stores, or similar to the alcohol industry, a separate license altogether; 
0 If a separate license type is created, whether any licenses should be set aside for social 
equity licensees, as Nevada did when they created their consumption site law; 
0 Regardless of how the license is structured, separate packaging and labeling criteria for 
on-site consumption should be spelled out in statute, including provisions permitting 
repackaging of unconsumed products; 
Q Whether separate facility and security requirements are necessary for on-premises 
consumption sites apart from those required of cannabis stores; 
0 A requirement that only cannabis or cannabis products purchased at the particular on- 
premises consumption site may be consumed at that location; and 
0 Explicit authorization for the sale of food and beverages at on-premises consumption 
sites and an explicit prohibition on the sale of liquor at the same site. 
None of these issues is addressed in the legislation as drafted and those deficiencies would create 
an unworkable statute that OCP would not be able to implement. It is necessary for the

www.maine.gov/dafs/ocp/
'l 4 
legislature to provide OCP with a statute that provides clear answers to the issues raised above 
instead of deferring those tough policy questions to the rulemakin g process. 
We are optimistic that this committee can work with our office, the industry, and subject matter 
experts to find a path forward to implementing this economic opportunity. As always, we thank 
you for your time and we’11 do our best to answer any questions you may have.
