 March 8, 2023 Re: LD 541 An Act to Create Parity in the Taxation of  Medicine Position: Support Dear Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry , and the esteemed members of  the Maine Taxation Committee,  My name is Ben Edwards. I am the owner of  the Schoppee Farm in Downeast Maine. We cultivate, harvest, and process hemp, and we produce low THC cannabis products - what most would call “CBD products”. We also collaborate with many medical caregivers to help formulate custom medicine for their patients. I am very appreciative of  the efforts of  Representative Fredricks, and others, to bring this common sense bill forward before the taxation committee. I have seen time and again the medicinal beneﬁts of  cannabis. Thousands of  times in fact in the last 4+ years. A number surprising even to me when I looked it up this evening. The very fact that we work with so many small caregivers to custom tailor medications to individual patients, and that patients will travel great distances to purchase them, is profound evidence of  not only the efﬁcacy of  the medicine but the dedication of  the caregivers involved.  I am very proud of  Maine’s long history of  putting the wellbeing of  its citizens ﬁrst, and of  supporting small Maine businesses. This bill does both. For the most part medical cannabis is crafted by small owner operated businesses that are the lifeblood of  Maine’s economy . Because of  marijuana’s federal illegality these business face a myriad of  burdensome challenges. Most patients that we work with suffer from highly refractory conditions not handled adequately by mainstream care and often because of  their conditions face signiﬁcant ﬁnancial hardship which often prevents them from affording the medicines they need. This puts the small businesses in the position of  having to subsidize the medicines themselves so their patients can have the medicines they need. Every single caregiver that we work with gives away product in this way , because it is simply needed and they are not willing to not provide it because of  an inability to pay . While removing the 5.5% sales tax may seem like a small gesture, I can assure you it is not. It will inject a little more money into Maine small businesses and put a little more needed medicine in patients hands. Please continue to put the health of  Maine’s citizens and the health of  Maine’s small business ﬁrst and pass LD 541. Sincerely , Benjamin C. Edwards
