LD 541
I am writing to support LD 541 “An Act To Create Parity In The Taxation Of 
Medicine” sponsored by Representative Fredericks of Sanford and co-sponsored by 
Representative Boyer of Poland. I have been a Patient in the Medical Cannabis 
Program of Maine for many years. I think that the Sales Tax on Medical Cannabis is 
legally and financially unfair. I feel that it should be abolished. Thank you for reading
my testimony.
