We are an international group of physicians, and other clinicians, who specialist in illnesses amenable to treatment with cannabis or cannabinoid medicines.  Our goals are to provide clinicians with appropriate education to ensure that their patients are getting the best, evidence-driven care, and to provide lawmakers with guidance to improve the tools by which these clinician provide that care.    Many of our patients, often because of their illness, are financially fragile.  They are unable or barely able to afford the medication that most effectively treats their illness.  As you know, medical cannabis treatments are not yet covered by healthcare insurance.  As such, the cost of these medicines places an undue burden on our sickest and most vulnerable citizens.  Any increase in the price of medicine sabotages these patientsâ€™ care.    It is worth noting that conventional medications are not taxed.  We understand that sick people are a protected class in our country and not a reasonable source of revenue for government.  These same sick individuals should not be penalized simply because the medication that they need is cannabis.    Most states already acknowledge this disparity and do not tax medical cannabis patients.  This includes MA, CT, MD, MN, NH, OR, SD, UT, VM, and VA.  We urge Maine join this esteemed list by doing the right thing for patients and enacting LD 541.  Sincerely,     Jordan Tishler, MD President, Association of Cannabinoid Specialists
