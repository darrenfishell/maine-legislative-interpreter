Stonington
LD 541
Honorable Members of the Taxation Committee, 
My name is Virginia Olsen I am from Stonington, ME. I support this bill on the merits. I 
question how the state would side on issues between the 2 cannabis groups without one 
bringing in the tax support to the state that it has in the past. Would recreational cannabis be 
given preference because of the revenue it would be providing to Maine? I would like to 
propose a different idea, I would like to see this committee table this bill or send it to VLA to 
so we can look at the language in LD 1195. We can remove the word "Recreational" and 
make this fund available for all cannabis operations and we are not creating inequities within 
the program, this actually may help the divide.
