Thank you for the opportunity to write in support of LD 541. My testimony will be short and to 
the point. Medical cannabis in Maine is categorized as a medicine, and should find parity by 
being taxed that way. After all, the state has a medical cannabis program. 
Another very important reason is that cannabis is not yet subsidized through insurance. So, 
please consider a cancer patient who can no longer work to support themselves and their 
family. While insurance may cover conventional care, it would not cover a full course of RSO.
I urge you all to consider to tax medical cannabis as a medicine in our medical cannabis 
program.
