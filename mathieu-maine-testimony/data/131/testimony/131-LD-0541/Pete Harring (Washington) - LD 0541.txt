Dear Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and the esteemed members of the Taxation 
Committee
My name is Pete Harring from Washington, ME. I am not a lobbyist or a member of any 
special interests group. I am an American citizen and a resident here in the Great State of 
Maine.
I see no reason why medical cannabis should be taxed more than any other kind of medicine.
Please support LD 541.
Thank you for your time, and I respectfully ask that you vote
 “Ought to Pass.” 
May you all have a Blessed day.
Pete Harring
