I am in support of this bill as I have received personal healing from the use of 
psilocybin mushrooms as well as witnessing healing in others, particularly those 
suffering from military ptsd. These are natural resources whose abilities to aid in the 
healing and recovery of those suffering from ptsd and mental health challenges are 
extremely valuable and should be made available to all.
