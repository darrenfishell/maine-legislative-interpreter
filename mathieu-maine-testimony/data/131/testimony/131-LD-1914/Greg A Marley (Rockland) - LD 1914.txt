Greg Marley, LCSW 1 Green Way Rockland, Maine 04841 T 207-319-4556 GregAMarley@gmail.comDate: May 15, 2023 Veterans and Legal Aﬀairs Committee Testimony in Support of Passage of LD 1914 An Act to Enact the Maine Psilocybin Access Act Good Day Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the committee. I am writing in support of passage of LD 1914 to clear the way for clinical use of psilocybin carried out in a reasoned and responsible way. I divide my professional identity in 2 distance areas. I work as a mental health clinician providing training and consultation to support suicide prevention and response after a suicide loss across the state of Maine.  And for the past 30 years I have provided education, training and consultation related to wild mushrooms as an author, workshop provider and consultant to poison centers across New England. In my second book, Chanterelle Dreams, Amanita Nightmares I covered the historic use of psilocybin and the recent research from the John Hopkins Medical Center supporting the use of Psilocybin in controlled sessions to address mystical experience and to address anxiety for those at the end of life. Since then clinical research and practice continues to support the great beneﬁts of a psychedelic experience to address resistant depression, past trauma and to Improve cognitive and life function. The research supports great outcomes with extremely limited negative side effects.  It is time for Maine to embrace this promising practice to address trauma and to improve the lives of the thousands who can beneﬁt from psilocybin used in controlled settings. Enactment of this legislation is a necessary beginning to establish the regulatory structure to make this a reality. Sincerely yours, Greg Marley, LCSW Rockland, Maine
