I am a medical practitioner that includes the use of herbal medicines in my private 
practice and I fully support the use of both psilocybin and psilocybin containing 
mushrooms and extracts for the treatment of mental health related disorders. Its 
benefits continue to be shown in clinical studies from top universities and clinics all 
around the country. Research has shown that psilocybin may have a positive impact 
on mood, anxiety, depression, and addiction. In clinical trials, it has been shown to be 
effective in reducing symptoms of treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and 
addiction, and improving quality of life. As a non-addictive, naturally occurring 
substance with no known toxicity in humans, I believe it has the potential to be a safe 
and effective adjunctive therapy to help heal our veterans and those suffering from 
substance abuse disorders and reduce the amount of tragic deaths from both overdose 
and suicide.
