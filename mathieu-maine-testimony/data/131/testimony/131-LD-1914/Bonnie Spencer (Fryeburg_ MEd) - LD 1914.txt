I am a licensed clinical social worker who works with children, adolescents and adults
who have experienced trauma.  I have been in practice for over 23 years, and I have 
seen the pros and cons of traditional medications on the lives of families of trauma 
survivors.  I have recently discovered the powers of psychedelics to help heal people 
who have suffered from anxiety, depression, trauma, obsessive compulsive disorder, 
ADHD, etc.  I recognize that there are may different types of psychedelics that can 
help with various aspects of inner healing work.  Unfortunately, there is only one 
psychedelic - Ketamine - that is currently legally available here in Maine.  I believe it 
would be incredibly important for veterans to have access to many different types of 
psychedelics to help them heal.  Please take the time to research, learn and understand
the profound positive effects that psychedelics can have on the healing process of our 
veterans.  Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
