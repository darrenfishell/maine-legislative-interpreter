LD 1914
My name is Eliah Thanhauser and I am the CEO of North Spore. We employ over 65 
people in Maine including veterans. I believe it is important to pass LD 1914 and 
decriminalize psilocybin.  Studies have shown psilocybin to be helpful in the 
treatment of PTSD and alcoholism. We've legalized cannabis in Maine which 
probably has less scientific proof for its health benefits than psilocybin so I see no 
reason we shouldn't decriminalize a substance that helps many people. I would love to
see Maine be one of the leaders in the nation for this cause. 
Thanks,
Eliah
