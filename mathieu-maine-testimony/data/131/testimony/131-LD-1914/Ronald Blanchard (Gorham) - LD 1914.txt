I'm a 37yr old veteran with 100% Service Connected Disability. 4 years ago I exited 
from a vehicle traveling 55mph while suffering a flashback. I was sleeping and 
believed the vehicle was fully engulfed and I needed to exit. Some of us are suffering,
but do not choose to do illegal drugs. Please enact this so we can explore all options 
in a safe and controlled environment.
