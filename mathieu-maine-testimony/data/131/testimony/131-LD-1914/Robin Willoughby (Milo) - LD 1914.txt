Good Morning, 
While I am not a veteran, I wanted to submit a testimony in support of the women and
men who have served our country. These people are seeking vital and effective 
treatment for the deep wounds that they and their fellow service men and women are 
trying to heal. 
I do not know what it is like to re-integrate into society after witnessing the horrors of 
war. To us civilians, it is unimaginable. But we know enough to know that we should 
be doing everything in our power to help our Veterans find a clearer, more defined 
path to healing. Psilocybin has been studied for decades. We know that it is effective. 
Why should our Veterans have to worry about about meeting stringent research study 
criteria, or leave the country, or have to worry about going “underground” illegally in 
order to find lifesaving treatment? Veterans often have lists of prescribed meds that 
have minimal to no effect. Why would we not make available to them what has been 
proven to be effective?
There is an alarming and growing mental health crisis in this country. Which means 
those enlisting today may already be at risk for being mental ill before they even 
serve. My niece is currently an Intelligence Specialist in the U.S Navy. I hear more 
frequently than I would like, about the suicide attempts on her ship. Please, let’s end 
the stigma and make psilocybin accessible. We will be saving lives. 
Thank you for your time,
