LD 1914
Please enact LD1914 and add a breakthrough health treatment for PTSD, CPTSD, as 
well as major depressive disorder. I attended a psilicybin retreat in Jamaica in 2018 as
a last ditch effort to come out of a decades-long depression. It was an experience of 
spiritual healing for me. My depression eased that week and with continued work, I 
am healed today and back in the world as a balanced, upbeat person. For veterans, the 
availability of psylicibin assisted treatment is crucial. The burden veterans 
carry--trauma, PTSD, horrific memories and injuries...psilicybin is an effective and 
safe treatment. Feeling good about who you are in the world is a value we need to 
give back to veterans who are suffering today.
