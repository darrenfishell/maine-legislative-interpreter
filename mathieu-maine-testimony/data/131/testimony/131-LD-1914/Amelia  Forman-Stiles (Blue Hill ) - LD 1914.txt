Esteemed Committee of Veterans and Legal Affairs, 
For the last 6 years I have served my community in Hancock County as both a sexual 
assault advocate and a mobile crisis provider. I have sat in many a kitchen, courtroom,
jail cell and emergency room. I can no longer reasonably keep count of how many of 
the wonderful people I have supported, have PTSD, many of them from experiences 
during deployment, many have no time served in the military. I am also the ex-spouse
of a member of the Air Force, he is the father of my two children, and he has a 
diagnosis of PTSD. I am also an MSW on track to become an LCSW with a vested 
interest in the wellness of my own community and all communities in Maine and 
beyond. Some day I hope to be certified to facilitate the use of Psilocybin in a clinical 
setting for the treatment of PTSD and other mental health disorders, legally. 
I know all too well the dearth of effective treatments for those suffering from trauma 
and resulting PTSD and Complex-PTSD. I know all too well the negative effect on 
everybody who loves or supports or employs or is parented by those who suffer and 
the exhaustion of searching for solutions and services, is palpable. Here we have a 
natural plant medicine, clinically and scientifically proven to be astoundingly 
efficacious.  Why would we do anything but back a legislative measure that makes 
Psilocybin legal, accessible and available to the many Maine citizens who could 
benefit from the profound healing benefits of this medicine. When there is an 
efficacious treatment for suffering, what mountains wouldn't any of us, including you,
esteemed committee members, move to access it? 
I urge you to vote yes on LD 1914, for the health of our communities. 
Sincerely, 
Amelia Forman-Stiles MHRT-CSP, MSW
