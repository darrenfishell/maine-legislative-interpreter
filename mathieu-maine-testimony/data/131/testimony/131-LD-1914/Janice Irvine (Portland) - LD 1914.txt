LD 1914
I am writing in strong support of LD1914. I am a sociologist at UMass Amherst, 
living full-time in Maine, and I have long been aware of the rigorous research on the 
effectiveness of psilocybin (and other psychedelics) in treating a broad range of 
mental health issues. Please support our veterans and all those in need of these 
well-proven medicines by supporting LD1914.
Thank you!
