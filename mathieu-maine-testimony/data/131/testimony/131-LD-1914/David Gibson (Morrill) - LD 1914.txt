I am writing in strong support of LD 1914, An Act to Enact the Maine Psilocybin 
Health Access Act.
I would like to encourage you to add provisions to the bill for research facilities to 
study the beneficial medical effects of psilocybin treatment. This could open up a new
field of research for higher education institutions in the state.
Psilocybin has tremendous medical benefits. Maine can be a leader in this.
