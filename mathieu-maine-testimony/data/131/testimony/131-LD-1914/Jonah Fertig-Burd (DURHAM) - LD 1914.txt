Dear Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs,
I am writing in support of the Psilocybin Health Access Act.   We have a mental 
health crisis in our state and country and study after study has shown that psilocybin 
is providing effective treatment for has helped people  overcome PTSD, addictions, 
trauma, depression and anxiety.  These medicines can be used safely to support 
people to address the roots of their challenges,  instead of just dealing with the 
symptoms like our current anti-depressants do. A growing number of veterans have 
used psilocybin to help them deal with debilitating PTSD and suicidal ideation, and 
has helped them reintegrate into their communities and live healthy lives. 
Psilocybin mushrooms come from nature and have been used for thousands of years. 
They have proven to be safe and effective. With the mental health crisis and high 
rates of addiction and suicide, we need every tool in our toolbox to help people to 
heal. This bill will creaste a pathway for these medicines to be used safely so that we 
can help the wellbeing of our communities.
Sincerely,
Jonah Fertig-Burd
