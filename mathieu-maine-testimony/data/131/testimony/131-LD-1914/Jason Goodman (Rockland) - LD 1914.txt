I support the decriminalizing of
Psilocybin in Maine for medical & recreational use. 
I am in support of its benefits in low-dose format for the treatment of depression, 
PTSD, etc…. I also believe that in higher doses, if one chooses to use psilocybin, it is 
also very effective for these conditions & that therapists should be able to do sessions 
with patients & prescribe it in a safe environment. 
The current testing of neuron re-growth with low dosage psilocybin as proved 
effective by Paul Stammits in mice, shows potential for Neuron degenerative 
reformation, which is applied to ALS, Dementia, and Parkinson's' Is what I would 
particularly like to see pursued in all clinical phases. 
I believe that legalization only makes a substance become more transparent & creates 
less crime around it based on what I’ve witnessed in other countries that adopt this 
principle and then also Maine should tax the items for sale & make revenue.
As I stand as a Maine resident, I see no reason why a mushroom could be illegal at all
and support the decriminalizing of psilocybin immediately. 
Sincerely 
Jason Goodman, Rockland Maine
