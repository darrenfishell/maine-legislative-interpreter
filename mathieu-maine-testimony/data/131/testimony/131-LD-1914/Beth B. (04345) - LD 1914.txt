To Senator Hickman, Representative Supika, and the esteemed members of the 
Committee on the
Veterans and Legal Affairs: I am writing to express support for the safe access to 
psilocybin treatment services. I suffer with PTSD and other neurological disabilities. I
have done a lot of research, and have discussed with my doctor, the beneficial factors 
of psilocyn by consuming mushrooms. It is a natural remedy; and when used 
responsibly and or under the care of a doctor, one could begin to heal. People were 
afraid of medical cannabis, despite the fact that it too has been used for centuries. 
Look at how far that has come in society. Mushrooms have also been medicinally 
used for centuries, and are still being used for medicinal practice in other countries. 
Thank you for your service.
