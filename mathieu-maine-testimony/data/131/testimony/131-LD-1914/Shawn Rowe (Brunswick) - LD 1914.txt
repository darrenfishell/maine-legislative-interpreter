LD 1914
In support of LD 1914
I first tried Psilocybin mushrooms just after the Covid pandemic hit in 2020. I had 
been dealing with debilitating depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms for years, and 
they were only exacerbated by the isolation brought about by the wide-reaching 
lockdown. I knew they were illegal when I decided to try them, but years of the 
medication carousel had worn me down to my rawest emotions and left me unable to 
deal with them even with traditional therapy. To keep it brief, psilocybin opened my 
eyes to my own cycle of self-sabotage and rigidity and also allowed me to work 
through feelings without going into a crisis mode that would normally have me 
making emergency calls to my psychiatrist, or even going to the ER. Both my 
therapist and psychiatrist have both remarked that they had never seen such swift 
progress with such little chemical treatment. I ask you to please, allow the passage of 
LD 1914 so people can have true healing in the state of Maine, and even blaze a trail 
for other states in the future. Let us be a hub of the new age of Psychiatry and healing 
without forcing a fear of legal repercussions upon already hurting people. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
