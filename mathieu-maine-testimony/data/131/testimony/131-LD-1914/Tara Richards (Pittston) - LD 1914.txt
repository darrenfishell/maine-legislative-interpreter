LD 1914
I am the wife of a Maine Army, two-time combat Veteran and I am writing to 
encourage you to vote in favor of LD1914.  Our military people have chosen to fight 
for our country knowing that they may pay the ultimate price for our freedoms.  
Combat Veterans face challenges most of us will never experience, nor can we 
imagine.  When they get home, they are given handfuls of pharmaceuticals that only 
mask the real issues and cause a range of additional, and worse effects.  They deserve 
better as do their families, who have supported their Veterans and borne the brunt of 
the effects of combat and over-medication of their loved ones.
Psylocibin mushrooms have allowed my husband to heal.  They have helped him to 
process through his trauma in a meaningful and safe way.  Prior to psylocibin 
mushrooms, my husband struggled with depression, anxiety, anger, and 
hypervigilance.  This made it difficult for him to enjoy experiences with our family as
he was not able to be fully present.  It was challenging for him to regulate his 
emotional response.  Since taking psylocibin mushrooms, all of this has changed.  He 
is able to be fully present with our family which has allowed him to enjoy vacations 
and events.  When we go out to eat, he no longer has to sit with his back to a wall as 
he is not consumed with hypervigilance.  Our Veterans deserve to be able to access 
safe and natural medications legally.  All of the citizens of Maine and throughout the 
country deserve this right.  Psylocibin mushrooms have changed our lives in positive, 
amazing ways.
