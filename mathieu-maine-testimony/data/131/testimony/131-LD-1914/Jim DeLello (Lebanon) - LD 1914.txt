I have read many articles relating to the benefits that can occur especially in patients 
with PTSD.  Too often in our current society we push people to pills and opioids as 
the mainstream remedy and many vets I have talked to have been pushed into this 
type of therapy which has had more hazardous results.  Natural remedies are often 
overlooked and there has been some amazing studies of the benefits medically on 
some of these treatments such as being proposed in this bill.  Please consider allowing
medical use for this type of treatment so we can make strides with helping many of 
the people who suffer from this condition who have been cast aside and found little 
relief from the current remedies that are available to them.
