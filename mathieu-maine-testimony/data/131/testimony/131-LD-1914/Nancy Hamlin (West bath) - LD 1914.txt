Re: LD 1914 An Act to Enact the Maine Psilocybin Health Access Act
Position: In Support
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Distinguished Members of the 
Committee,
My name is Nancy Hamlin, Army Veteran who suffers from chronic PTSD, Major 
Depressive Disorder, several auto immune diseases and chronic pain. I have tried 
several VA medications, multiple types of mental health therapies, and had little 
relief. My counselor told me to research MAPS for psilocybin assisted therapies. To 
offer these treatments more readily will save Veterans' lives. I can say this because I 
have both experienced and seen deep healing in others with psilocybin therapy. 
The Veterans that have found ways to do it without therapeutic aid have reported it 
has helped. Imagine how it could heal them in the therapeutic setting being suggested.
I ask, for my brothers and sisters in arms, please approve LD 1914. We lose too many
Veterans to suicide due to lack of healing options that fit their needs. This most 
definitely will improve lives. Thank you for your time.
