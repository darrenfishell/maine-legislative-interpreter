I am a registered nurse with a masters in plant medicine and have personally 
witnessed other humans heal themselves through the use of psilocybin as well as have
used psilocybin to heal myself.  The benefits of psilocybin is incredibly promising for 
so many people struggling with their health and wellness. The safety profile is robust. 
I support this bill and advocate for the use of psilocybin.
