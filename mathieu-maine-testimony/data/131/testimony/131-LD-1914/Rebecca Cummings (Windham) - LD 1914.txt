LD 1914
I write in opposition to LD 1914. 
I DO NOT SUPPORT ANY LEGISLATION WHICH ATTEMPTS TO LEGALIZE, 
DECRIMINALIZE, OR NORMALIZE DRUG CULTURE IN THE STATE OF 
MAINE!
I find it even more egregious that such bills are coming from the veterans affairs 
committee. SHAME!
Drug use was NOT tolerated in the Armed Services and it shouldn't be normalized in 
the civilian world or used as a substitute for proper mental health services.
LD 1914 OUGHT NOT PASS
