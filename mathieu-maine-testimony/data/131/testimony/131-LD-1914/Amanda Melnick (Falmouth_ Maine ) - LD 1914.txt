Re: LD1914 An Act to Enact the Maine Psilocybin Health Access Act
Position: Support
Dear Senator Hickman, Representative Supika, and the esteemed members of the 
Committee on
Veterans and Legal Affairs:
My name is Amanda Melnick, and I am writing in support of LD 1914. There are 
studies from the most-respected medical universities and labs in the world on the 
amazing results from psilocybin therapies (including Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Yale, 
UCSF, and many others). The Veterans Administration is now participating in at least
five trials of psychedelic drugs (including psilocybin) in New York, California and 
Oregon. 
There is absolutely no reason that this plant should be illegal. When taken in a 
supportive setting with proper dosage and integration, it has been shown to have 
incredibly postitive results. As per the paper: "Analysis of Psilocybin-Assisted 
Therapy in Medicine: A Narrative" found in the National Library of Medicine via the 
National Institute of Health:
"Results from these trials have shown significant reductions in depression and anxiety
when compared with a placebo, and one trial found no significant difference when 
compared to a routinely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). 
Studies conducted with patients with advanced-stage cancer have demonstrated that 
psilocybin may also be beneficial at reducing depression and anxiety associated with 
psychological crises due to a terminal diagnosis. Psilocybin therapy in the treatment 
of addiction, which is notoriously difficult to treat, has shown encouraging results. 
Due to its low toxicity and low risk of overuse, psilocybin has the potential to have a 
significant influence in the field of addiction medicine."
Please support this bill and the use of this natural medicine. 
Thank you,
Amanda Melnick
