Please pass this.  There is such a terrible mental health issue in the U.S.A. something 
needs to be done to help our friends and family members.  Please pass this bill for the 
mental health of our country. So many mass shootings lately that may have been 
avoided if those people had help another alternative to pharmaceuticals.
