LD 1914
I am for Bill LD 1914, An Act to Enact the Maine Psilocybin Health Access Act. I 
have heard veterans describe the amazing breakthroughs in their post-traumatic 
distress symptoms from psilocybin treatment in therapy. I've read similar positive 
results in the careful use of psilocybin under professional guidance for a variety of 
mental health issues such as depression, ADHD, addictions, and anxiety as well as 
end-of-life assistance. The public interest, research, and trials with psilocybin have 
increased enormously in recent years and all indicate the unique value of of 
psilocybin for improving health, well-being, and spiritual understanding when used 
with appropriate guidance and settings.
