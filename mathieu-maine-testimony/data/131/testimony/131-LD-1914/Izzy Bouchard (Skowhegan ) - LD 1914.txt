Hello, I am a Maine veteran who has a service connected disability. I have been in 
therapy for years and have been prescribed multiple different medications. I no longer
take the medications as I do not like the side effects. I have heard about veterans in 
other states that have undergone psilocybin treatment and the results are pretty 
amazing. I would be very interested in having this treatment if Maine legalized this. 
Thank you.
