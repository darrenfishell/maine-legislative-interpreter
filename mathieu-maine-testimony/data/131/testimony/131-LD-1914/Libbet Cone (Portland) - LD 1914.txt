LD 1914
I am 72 years old. In 2015 I found myself in a 4 year depression(PTSD) that I couldn't
get out of, despite constant and deep psychotherapy, medications, etc. I had been a 
successful professional, raised 2 children had a wide social network, and was an avid 
outdoor explorer. I had been researching the work being done with psychedelics and 
decided, despite it's illegality, to try it for myself, even tho' it was a risk legally to do 
that as all that was available was underground work. Over the next 2 years I had 3 
experiences, the protocol for PTSD,  and today I am happy to report that I am fully 
healed, have started a new business, and have returned to an active and full life, fuller 
and more joyful frankly that what I had been living before.  Please vote for the 
passage of LD1914.
