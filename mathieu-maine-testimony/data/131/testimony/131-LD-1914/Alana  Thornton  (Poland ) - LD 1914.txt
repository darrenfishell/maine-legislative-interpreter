I was prescribed SSRIs for 20 years - my entire adult life. After the loss of my father 
and best friend and being completely numb to it all, I carried major guilt on top of all 
of my childhood traumas. It took me 18 months to get off these medications. Slowly I 
was able to feel EVERYTHING. Psilocybin, under supervision, fast tracked the 
processing of things that may have taken me a lifetime to concur. Itâ€™s deep effects 
were transformative to me mentally, spiritually, and physically. Give others a chance 
to do the same.
