I am a Family Physician in private practice and see veterans and civilians alike. The 
vast majority of my patients have suffered some form trauma and have some degree 
of post traumatic stress that affects their ability to function, thrive and overcome 
chronic health conditions. This has only been exacerbated since the Covid-19 
pandemic and the rates of mental illness, addictions, suicide and other maladaptive 
health behavior have skyrocketed while mental health resources seem to be ever more
sparse and limited. Finding and implementing effective, safe and well studied 
approaches to trauma recovery needs to be a priority if  our society is to grow and 
evolve from our collective and individual traumas. In light of the testimonies of 
individuals and research that I have reviewed I think it is important that we consider 
psilocybin based therapies as they have the potential to be transformative healing 
tools for our veterans who are suffering as well as many other patients who could 
benefit from safe, legal alternatives for trauma, mental illness and addiction recovery. 
The stigma of psilocybin's history should not overshadow its potential as a powerful 
healing tool. Please strongly consider supporting this bill for the veterns, civilians and
for the treating physicians, all seeking to be whole, healthy members of our collective 
society.
