I am a us marine, infantry machine gunner and two time combat veteran.  100%PT 
disabled veteran.  myself and countless other veterans have traumatic brain injuries, 
PTSD, nerve damage , etc  the psilocybin cubensis mushroom has healing properties 
that specifically helped with these traumas. I'm sure you have access to the 
information and science behind that.  I am here to testify , saying we need legal access
to this medicinal fungi.  we need all bans lifted.  as veteran and common citizens 
alike.  we need the free use of natural medicines.  please pass this bill for all your 
people of Maine to have the access to the medicine they deserve.  it works its clean 
and its natural. thank you
