Hello,
Thank you for reading my testimony. I am here to share the profound healing 
experiences I have had through psilocybin. Through my therapeutic experiences with 
psilocybin I have unpacked trauma and found love for myself and my community in 
ways that I was not able to through talk therapy. I went from a place of being lost to a 
place of hope and love. Psilocybin does not automatically fix all of your problems, 
but it gives you an incredible tool to help you. I have spoken to countless people in 
Maine who feel the same. 
Please support this Act! Thank you again :)
