I have been following the research on psilocybin for many years now. The success 
rate and overall efficacy of the substance is enormous when compared to other drugs, 
if administered properly. I've seen undeniable evidence of such in other states that 
have laws regarding responsible and medicinal psilocybin use. Please allow people 
access to the medicine they deserve to be able to live a better life.
