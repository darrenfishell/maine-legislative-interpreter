I will make this really simple for you all so you can stop wasting tax payer dollars and
work on actual important issues in our state like the homeless crisis in Portland and 
the opioid epidemic. 
Simply strike the laws prohibiting mushrooms. 
It’s that simple. It’s what you need to do with cannabis, also. 
All this time and energy you’re putting into these bills has nothing to do with public 
safety and everything to do with power, control and money. 
Respectfully, just stop. Leave us, our plants and our mushrooms alone.
