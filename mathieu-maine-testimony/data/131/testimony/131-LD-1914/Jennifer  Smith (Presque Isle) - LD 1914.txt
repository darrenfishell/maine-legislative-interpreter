LD 1914
My name is Jennifer Smith. My husband and I attended the Maine Fungi Fest this past
weekend and became aware of the LD1914. We support the passing of this 
legislature. 
I am a healthcare professional in cancer care and the legal use of Psilocybin would 
change 
Peopleâ€™s lives as to what is available to them to help with pain and anxiety. I am also 
now aware how significant this could be in the assistance of getting people off of 
Opiods, treating Veterans with PTSD, and others with mental health challenges. 
Mushrooms have been used for thousands of years. They are not addictive. This 
would be such a wonderful tool in helping so many people.
