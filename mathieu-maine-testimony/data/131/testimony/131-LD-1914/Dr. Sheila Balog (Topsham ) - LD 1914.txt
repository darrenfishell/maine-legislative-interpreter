As a clinical psychologist, it is evident that we need better tools that work faster and 
more efficiently than what is already in use. Research has demonstrated that 
psilocybin is an effective tool in mental health treatment. With the dearth of providers
having availability in Maine we need treatments that work efficiently so that more 
patients can be treated. Waitlists are extremely long and people with mental health 
issues are suffering. We need this law to pass so that more providers can get up to 
speed and trained in this groundbreaking treatment as soon as possible.
