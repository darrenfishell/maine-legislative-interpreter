Apologies for the delay, but as someone who lives with family members with acute 
anxiety, social anxiety and OCD we NEED natural, plant based medicine options that 
can be grown and microdosed by the patients for their needs. Please stop supporting 
the drug companies and allow people access to this important medicine that has been 
used by humans for centuries.
