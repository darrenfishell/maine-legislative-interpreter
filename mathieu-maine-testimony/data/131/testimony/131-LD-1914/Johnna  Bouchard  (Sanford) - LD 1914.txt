I believe psilocybin should be legal for the many health benefits including mental 
health which is one of the most important issues in our country right now. There has 
many scientists that have proven that there are potential benefits of psilocybin for 
mental health decades ago and it was ignored.
Please look at all the evidence of the scientists, mycologists and studies of people that
have used it to help their health all of the positive affects to heal people which we 
need so desperately right now. Thank You.
