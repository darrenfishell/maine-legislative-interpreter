I don't know where I would be today if not for psilocybin therapy. I had been 
struggling with crippling social anxiety for years, which left me feeling isolated, 
alone, and depressed. I desperately wanted to make connections with people, but my 
negative thought patterns held me back, and I felt stuck.
When I discovered psilocybin therapy, everything changed. The experience allowed 
me to break free from my limiting thought patterns and gain a new perspective on my 
anxiety. I felt a sense of connection and empathy with others that I had never 
experienced before, which helped me overcome feelings of isolation and 
self-consciousness in social situations.
I firmly believe that psilocybin therapy should be decriminalized for personal use by 
adults over the age of 21 and allowed for health-related therapeutic means. This 
natural medicine, not a drug, could really help a lot of people who are struggling with 
mental health issues. Unlike some other treatments, there is no threat of addiction and 
almost no side effects.
For anyone struggling with social anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues, I 
would highly recommend considering psilocybin therapy. It truly changed my life, 
and I am so grateful for the transformative experience it provided me.
