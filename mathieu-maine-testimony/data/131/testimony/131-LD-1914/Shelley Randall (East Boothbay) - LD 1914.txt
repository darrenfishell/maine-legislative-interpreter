My name is Shelley Randall.  I have worked with those challenged by substance use 
disorder for approximately 32 years in a professional capacity.  I was a counselor in a 
half way house for felons convicted of drug offenses, a counselor in a methadone 
clinic and as a lawyer representing children, parents and the State of NH in Child 
Protection cases.  I also represented patients in NH and MA State Hospitals suffering 
from substance use disorder and severe mental illness.
Throughout my professional career I witnessed the profound level of frustration and 
burnout experienced by the professionals working with these populations and the 
systems that serve them:  social workers; lawyers; doctors and judges.  Childrenare  
placed in fostercare because their parents have been jailed or died as a result of 
substance use disorder.  Medically assisted treatment such as methadone and/or 
suboxone allow for the bare minimal functioning of the patient who frequently is 
taking the medication for 10 - 15.
The on-going clinical trials regarding the benefits of psychedelic medicines - 
psilocybin in particular show great promise in treating and healing the patient 
challenged by substance use disorder.  The trials indicate that the treatment is not a 
lifelong endeavor but can be effective after several sessions.
By-passing this opportunity would be a travesty as we continue to grapple with the 
ramifications and impact on families in the State of Maine resulting from the opioid 
crisis.
