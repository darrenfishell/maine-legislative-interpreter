 I would like to testify in support of the upcoming bill, LD 1914, Maine Psilocybin Health Access Act.
All research that I have read indicates that the use of Psilocybin mushrooms, when used with guidance and discretion, can be extremely helpful in the treatment of many psychiatric and emotional issues. Both PTSD and addiction diseases show exceptional response to the use of psilocybin.
My personal experiences over the past 43 years would also support the positive eï¬€ects of psilocybin use. I have witnessed a number of friends and acquaintances who were able to make great progress when struggling with emotional and addiction issues.
Please vote to approve LD 1914, Maine Psilocybin Health Health Access Act.
With Best Regards,
