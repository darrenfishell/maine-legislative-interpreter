I am a big believer in the research that has been conducted on psilocybin and I 
strongly think this medicine should be made available to those that could benefit from
it. Those with depression, anxiety, ptsd, neurodegenerative conditions like ALS, and 
so on. Maine has the ability to act progressively on decriminalizing natural healing 
medicines. Letâ€™s work together to create a better world. Thank you.
