Dear Senator Hickman, Representative Supika, and the esteemed members of the 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs:
Thank you for your time. I'm providing written testimony in support of LD1914 An 
Act to Enact the Maine Psilocybin Health Access Act. I strongly encourage you to 
support LD1914 which will provide legal access to a highly-effective and 
comparably-safe medical intervention for those who have not responded to 
conventional treatments. It is especially timely and important to support this 
legislation because a rapidly growing number of patients in Maine are using 
psilocybin-containing mushrooms and products. There has been substantially more 
research and case studies conducted on the effectiveness of microdosing of psilocybin
for widespread (and the continually growing trend of) conditions such as: PTSD, 
depression including treatment-resistant depression and anxiety, Parkinson's, 
dementia and other conditions. Paul Stamets has been a leader among many in this 
field who is currently conducting empirically validated and broad sample case studies 
on microdosing of psylocibin with positive effects for some of the conditions listed:

found here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32899469/
Please consider passing this bill to help patients in Maine with PTSD (including 
veterans), depression and anxiety, Parkinson's and other chronic and debilitating 
conditions that have not had success with other treatment modalities. Legalizing 
psylocibin would help these patients as well as practitioners and the field of 
psylocibin research in medicine. Please consider passing this bill for the many 
Mainers who could benefit from psylocibin. Thank you for your time. 
Sincerely,
Mercedes Grandin
