I am in support of this bill as I have personally witnessed veterans with severe PTSD 
profoundly shift their lives  in ways unimaginable with the current  protocol of talk 
therapy and pharmaceutical medications. I have also been witness to a loved one 
facing a terminal illness release the fear of death after a mushroom journey which in 
turn enabled them to live their final days in a space of peace , love and quality 
connections with family members that may have been strained. My Dad was 
unfortunately not able to do that and suffered in fear on his way to death as he was 
unable to explore this path. I know without a doubt that this would have helped him as
well as my family. Please consider this for all who suffer.
