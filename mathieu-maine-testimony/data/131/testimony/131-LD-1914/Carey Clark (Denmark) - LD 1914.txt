As a registered nurse with a PhD I am familiar with the healing properties of the 
psilocybin entheogen. This plant medicine has a very low risk for addiction and has 
been successfully legalized in other states with no grave concerns emerging. I believe 
the legalization of psilocybin could create a new revenue stream for Mainers, and 
support people who use this medicine in microdoses  to manage their health and 
wellness,  have access to safe and effective medicine. There may also be opportunities
to research the effectiveness of the medicine and trained medical professionals could 
offer people with conditions like PTSD, depression, substance use disorders, and 
chronic pain support with therapeutic use of this medicine. Thanks for your time and 
consideration. Carey S Clark, PhD, RN, AHN-BC, FAAN, Professor of Nursing
