I want to voice my support for legalization of psilocybin as a therapeutic medicine for
a variety of mental health issues. There is simply no good reason that this should not 
be made available as an option to people who are suffering, especially considering the
fact that we allow much more dangerous and harmful drugs to be used in healthcare. 
Psilocybin is only prohibited due to a misguided drug war in this country and 
ignorance on the part of those who lumped it in with extremely harmful substances 
like heroin and meth. There are no significant physical health risks with psilocybin - it
simply helps a person to change the landscape of their mind, and if we are not free to 
change our minds, we have no freedom at all.
