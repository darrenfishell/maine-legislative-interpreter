Testimony of Kimberley Moore, Director — Bureau of Employment Services, 
Maine Department of Labor 
Neither For Nor Against LD 1539, 
An Act to Promote a Diverse, More Experienced Construction Workforce and Ensure High 
quality Careers by Increasing Registered Apprenticeship Programs 
To the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
Public Hearing April 19, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing, my name is Kim Moore and I am the Bureau Director of Employment 
Services at the Maine Department of Labor (Department). On behalf of the Department, I am 
offering this testimony neither for nor against LD 1539, "An Act to Promote a Diverse, More 
Experienced Construction Workforce and Ensure High-quality Careers by Increasing 
Registered Apprenticeship Programs ”. 
The bill sets specific standards for registered apprenticeship programs in the construction 
industry. This bill also requires establishment of a financial incentive program for registered 
apprenticeships and additional criteria for funding registered apprenticeship programs within 
the construction industry. It does not establish a funding source for the additional staff 
requirements to administer a Registered Apprenticeship program with rules, incentives, and 
measures solely applicable to the construction industry and the related incentive payments. 
The Maine Apprenticeship Program is a key component of the state's workforce development 
strategy and has experienced an increased interest in the current labor market. In 2021, the 
Maine Apprenticeship Program received a $5.5 million State Apprenticeship Expansion, Equity, 
and Innovation grant from the U.S. Department of Labor. Maine was one of 15 states to 
receive this grant funding dedicated to further develop, modernize, and diversify registered 
apprenticeship programs across the state. A significant focus of the funding is dedicated to 
supporting and expanding entry to and persistence in Registered Apprenticeship for 
underrepresented populations including women, people with disabilities, people of color, and 
justice-involved individuals. While this work isjust beginning, the work is clearly aligned with

the proposed legislation. 
We offer the following considerations to the Committee pertaining to three key sections of 
the bill. 
0 As written, the bill language applicable to minimum requirements around "total package value" 
which includes wages, the dollar value of employer-paid health insurance, and the dollar value 
of employer-paid retirement contribution benefits, appears to apply to all Maine Registered 
Apprenticeships. In conversation with the bill sponsor yesterday, we understand the 
requirement would only apply to the construction industry. MDOL will need to evaluate in 
which cases and how "total package value" is currently collected from the construction industry 
to determine potential impact. 
0 With regard to establishing a separate financial incentive program for recruitment of historically 
underrepresented populations into construction industry apprenticeships and providing 50% of 
funds to stipends for registered apprentices, we must emphasize this cannot be accomplished 
without specifically dedicated funding to support Department staff resources and the incentive 
payments themselves. The Department would encourage emphasis on persistence in or 
completion of a registered apprenticeship vs a recruitment incentive. 
0 Federal and state requirements for Registered Apprenticeship programs establish a minimum 
of 2,000 hours of on—the—job learning and 144 hours per year of related instruction. The 
majority of registered occupations in the construction industry are 8,000-hour programs. Out of 
1,212 Apprentices registered (as of April 14, 2023), 14 Construction Laborer apprentices (1%) 
are in registered apprenticeship programs that meet state and federal program standards but 
would fall outside of these additional requirements. The Department does not recognize the 
need for or support establishing a separate minimum standard for the construction industry 
with regard to on thejob and classroom training. 
0 Finally, we recommend adding “as funding permits" language, should the Committee decide to 
proceed with this legislation. 
In summary, the Department appreciates the overall goal of this bill as it relates to supporting 
and strengthening apprenticeships, and we appreciate Representative Gere for bringing this 
bill forward. MDOL is committed to being an active participant in ongoing discussions with 
the sponsor, as well as conversations with impacted union and non-union apprenticeship 
sponsors. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony, and the Department will be 
available for the work session to assist with the technical aspects of this bill.
