LD 164
I am a resident of Orono, Maine living year-round on Pushaw Lake.  I strongly 
support LC 164:  An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
As a Board member of Maine Lakes and Chair of the LakeSmart Committee I am 
actively involved in efforts to protect and improve our beautiful lakes.  Volunteer 
LakeSmart evaluators meet with lakeside homlowners to thoroughly assess how well 
pollution from septic systems and ground water runoff is being controlled on that 
property.  Where needed, Best Management Practices are recommended to improve 
and hopefully eliminate the flow of herbicides, pesticides, chemicals, and sewage into
the lake.  The key to success is establishing a robust shoreline buffer to divert and 
absorb runoff.  Our role is advisory only.  It remains up to the property owner to 
implement our suggestions.  This, unfortunately, is where best intentions often fail.  
Implementation is limited by the cost of materials and/or labor.  It is my hope that LD
164 will allow some assistance to homeowners to fund these projects.  While each 
individual project is small, these corrective actions are the last stand before runoff 
enters the lake.
