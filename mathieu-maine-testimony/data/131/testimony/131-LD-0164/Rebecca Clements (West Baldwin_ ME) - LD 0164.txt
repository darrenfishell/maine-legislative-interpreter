Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
I am writing to ask for your support of the bill to protect the health of 
our Maine lakes:  LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and 
Protection Fund.
I live on a farm in West Baldwin, Maine.  Our family also has a cabin on 
Hancock Pond in Denmark, Maine.  In the 1950's, my husband's parents 
purchased land and built a cabin on Barker Pond in Hiram, Maine. They 
drove there from New Jersey, and then Illinois, every summer to join 
their grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins swimming, fishing, 
canoeing, and waterskiing in the pristine waters of Maine.  It was his 
favorite place in the whole world!  Hence, when we married in 1972, he 
insisted we honeymoon at his parents' lake cabin-- even though it was 
December and we had to pull our luggage on a toboggan over the frozen 
lake to a cabin heated only by a wood stove.  I had never been to Maine, 
but, even in midwinter, I fell in love with its beauty.  We brought our 
four boys to Maine every summer, first to Barker Pond, and, when we 
could afford it, to our own cabin on Hancock Pond.  We moved to the 
farm in West Baldwin, becoming full-time Mainers, when my husband 
retired.
We joined the Hancock and Sand Ponds Lake Association and learned of 
the importance of caring for the lakes, to protect them from invasive 
species like milfoil, from runoff that can bring fertilizer into the lakes, 
feeding unwanted algae.  I served as President of our lake association for 
several years and worked closely with Colin Holme of the Lakes 
Environmental Association.  We need this funding to protect our lakes.  
Please vote to help keep Maine lakes healthy for our children and 
grandchildren.
Sincerely,
Rebecca Clements
