I support LD16+ to fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.  Over the past 10 
years I have noticed significant increases of algae, increased temperatures and 
increased invasive species in Sebago Lake.  I believe that we can stem the rate of 
change with proper attention to these matters.
Thank you for your support of this bill.
