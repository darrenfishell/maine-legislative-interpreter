LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Mark Whiting. I live in Ellsworth and I am a retired scientist. I am asking
for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and 
Protection Fund.
There is a critical need for more funding for lake protection projects, including 
implementation of Best Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, 
stronger invasive species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic 
algae blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming decades. 
Please invest in Maineâ€™s future by protecting our natural resources.  Thanks.
Signed, Dr Mark Whiting
