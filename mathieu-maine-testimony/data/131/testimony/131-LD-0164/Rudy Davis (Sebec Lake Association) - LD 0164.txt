Rudy Davis
Sebec Lake Association
LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee:
My name is Rudy Davis and I am the President of the Sebec Lake Association.  My 
family also spend the summer at Sebec Lake. On behalf of the Sebec Lake 
Association, and my entire extended family, I am asking for your support today for 
LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
 The effects of increased development and land clearing, and the expanding threat of 
invasive plant species such as Hydrilla and Eurasian Millfoil, are putting our lakes at 
greater risk with every passing day. Funding for lake protection projects, including 
implementation of Best Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, 
stronger invasive species prevention and management programs, and treatment of 
lakes with chronic algae blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the
coming decades.  Our lakes are the economic engine that drive many small 
communities. This is certainly the case for the four communities that border Sebec.
I urge you to invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local 
economies, outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water 
supplies, wildlife habitat and so much more for all who use lakes in the future.
 Signed, 
Rudy Davis, President
Sebec Lake Association
Dover Foxcroft, ME
