Dear Committee Members,
I own a home on Abrams Pond in Eastbrook and have been a volunteer water quality monitor 
for the past 5 years and am the VP of the Abrams Pond Association. I have noticed that our 
algae blooms have been getting progressively worse and we may be on the verge of requiring
an alum treatment. Our pond association has been working hard to prevent run-off of 
phosphorus into our lake and has received grants to help fix camp roads and improve many 
things that contribute to the water quality. We will be needing the help that this bill could 
provide to help us to keep the lake water quality as high as possible for the people who enjoy 
it and the wildlife that depend on it. Please support this bill for the future of Maine's beautiful 
lakes!
Thank you!
