LD 164
Dear members of the Environment ansd Natural Resources Committee--
I urge you to support LD 164 to fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund. We live in 
Scarborough but have had a cabin in Stoneham, along the stream that is a primary source of 
water for Kezar Lake, for nearly twenty years. I have served on the Lovell Invasive Plant 
Prevention Committee and am currently a trustee of the Kezar Lake Watershed Association.  
The effects of a changing climate and development pressures put our lakes at tremendous 
risk. We need help funding lake protection projects! 
Please support LD 164!
With thanks, Lucy LaCasse
