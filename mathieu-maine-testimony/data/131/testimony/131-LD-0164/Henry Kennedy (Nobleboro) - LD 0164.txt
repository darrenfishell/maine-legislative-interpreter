LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
I am writing from Kieve Wavus Education (KWE) in Nobleboro, Maine to ask for 
your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection 
Fund. 
KWE is a nonprofit organization, located on Damariscotta Lake, that leads 
educational programs to empower people to contribute positively to society by 
promoting the values of kindness, respect for others, and environmental stewardship. 
We feel the effects of climate change on Damariscotta Lake and the woods and waters
traveled on our programs’ wilderness trips. The effects of warming waters, longer 
growing seasons, larger rain events, and increased development pressure are putting 
our lakes – and KWE’s programs – at greater risk with every passing day. 
Healthy lakes are critical to the survival of industries that set Maine apart and lift up 
our economy, including Maine’s iconic camping industry, which contributes over 
$500 million to our economy annually, and the outdoor recreation industry, which 
contributed $3 billion to our economy in 2019 alone.  
We must take action. Funding for lake protection projects, including implementation 
of Best Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, stronger 
invasive species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic algae 
blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming decades.
Please invest in the healthy future of Maine’s lakes today to protect local economies, outdoor 
tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife habitat and so 
much more for all who use lakes in the future.
 
Sincerely,
Henry Kennedy
Executive Director Emeritus
Kieve Wavus Education, Inc.
