LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Andrea Lasman and I live on Woods Pond in Bridgton. We decided to 
move to Maine several years ago after decades of visiting specifically to spend time 
on Maine’s lakes.  Over the years, I have witnessed the changes that are threatening 
the health of these magnificent lakes—changes brought on by climate change and 
increased development in watershed areas. Funding for lake protection projects, 
including implementation of Best Management Practices, replacement of failing 
septic systems, stronger invasive species management programs, and treatment of 
lakes with chronic algae blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the
coming decades. Investing in the future of Maine’s lakes is critical, so I am asking for
your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection 
Fund.
As a Courtesy Boat Inspector and member of the Woods Pond Association, I am 
committed to doing my part, but I realize that it will take increased resources to 
address all of these issues.  Bridgton’s lakes drive its economy; we need you, our 
legislators, to prioritize and safeguard our lakes. 
Please invest in the healthy future of Maine’s lakes today to protect local economies, 
outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife 
habitat and so much more for all of us who use lakes now and will in the future.
Respectfully yours,
Andrea Lasman
