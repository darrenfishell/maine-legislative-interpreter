To the Committee of Environment and Natural Resources
I support of LD 164
Dear Committee Members,
I am writing today to support, enthusiastically, the funding that is critical to Maine Lakes through LD 164.
 As a summer resident of Wayne on Lake Androscoggin I have seen ﬁrsthand how the health of our lakes is threatened. Since 2020 we have been battling an infestation of variable water milfoil. As it was discovered early and aggressively monitored and initially removed through the eﬀorts of the Androscoggin Lake Association, 30 Mile River, Lake Stewarts of Maine and the DEP the contagion has been limited to one end of the inner cove. 
As I’m sure you know variable water milfoil is a lake killer and it is easily spread, in fact the infestation was discovered in Sept. by an Eyes on the Water volunteer who noticed a fragment ﬂoating on the surface. As you might also know Androscoggin has, at least, six bass tournaments that take place on the lake bringing in boats and ﬁsherman from all over the Northeast.
The presence of invasive and their eradication is only one aspect of lake health. Maine lakes provide wonderful recreational opportunities, are critical habitat for untold species of birds, ﬁsh and other animals and make Maine a vacation paradise. This funding is overdue and in the intense competition over ﬁnite resources I speak for the lakes. 
Sincerely, Katherine Mahoney (summer resident)
