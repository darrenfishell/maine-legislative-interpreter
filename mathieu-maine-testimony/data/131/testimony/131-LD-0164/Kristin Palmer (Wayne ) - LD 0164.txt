LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
 
My name is Kristin Palmer and I have spent the summer in Wayne on Androscoggin Lake for 
55 years. I am asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration 
and Protection Fund.
 
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and increased 
development pressure are putting our lakes at greater risk with every passing day. Funding 
for lake protection projects, including implementation of Best Management Practices, 
replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive species management programs, and 
treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health
in the coming decades.
 
Please invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local economies, outdoor 
tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife habitat and so 
much more for all who use lakes in the future.  Our family and friends have a deep connection
to Maine and look forward to our kids and many future generations continuing to enjoy the 
local beauty.  We would greatly appreciate your support in our efforts to preserve the lakes.  
 
Signed,
Kristin Palmer
