Re: LD 164, An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund
On behalf of the Cobbosseecontee Lake Association (CLA), I offer these 
comments in full support of LD 164.  We want to thank Representative 
Bridgeo for bring this bill to your committee.  We applaud his commitment to 
ensure the ongoing allocations of $9,000,000 will be available to the DEP and 
their efforts to projects in the State that improve or maintain the quality of 
lake waters in our State.
Cobbosseecontee Lake, which is located roughly 5 miles from here, is a large 
and vulnerable water body that has recently been impacted by three different 
invasive aquatic plants.  The lake has been threatened with an infestation of 
Eurasian water milfoil, variable leaf milfoil and frog bit.  To our knowledge it 
is the only lake in Maine where all three have been identified.  To that end, the 
CLA began an aggressive campaign to increase membership and raise funds to 
help with eradication efforts.  It is an enormous challenge for everyone to 
improve and/or maintain lake quality and we are committed to doing our 
part, but we cannot do it alone.  This legislation will be one more tool in the 
tool box to insure our lake and all affected lakes in Maine will have good water 
quality for the citizens of Maine, and those from away who visit our State, to 
enjoy.
We urge you to vote to allocate this needed funding.  Thank you for your time 
and consideration of our comments.
