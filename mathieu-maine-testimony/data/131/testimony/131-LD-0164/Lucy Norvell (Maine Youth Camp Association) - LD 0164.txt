To the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources:
On behalf of the Maine Youth Camp Association (“MYCA”), the non-profit organization of 
Maine camps throughout our state, we are pleased to submit this letter in support of LD 164, An 
Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
Children’s camps are an important part of the fabric of our state, providing an outdoor 
educational experience for children from Maine, from across the country and around the world.  
Maine is the leader for children’s camping.  The first camps were established here more than 100 
years ago. Today, children’s camps in Maine serve an estimated 40,000 children annually, and  
about half of all camper days are filled by Maine children.  In a normal season, Maine youth 
camps are responsible for approximately $500 million of economic activity.
Camps provide an outdoor living experience for children that builds social skills and accentuates 
the importance of our natural resources.  This learning is experiential, in that campers learn by 
doing.  Camps offer this in a setting where children learn how to get along with peers, develop 
habits of self-actualization and discipline, experience success and learn how to overcome failure.  
And all this, perhaps for the first time, without the presence of their parents.
MYCA fully supports the goals of this legislation.  As stewards of Maine’s environment, Maine 
Youth Camps want to ensure that our camp environment, especially the lakes near or on which 
most camps are located, is healthy and sustainable.  Our success and our State’s success is 
dependent upon that.  
Sincerely,
Lucy Norvell
Executive Director
