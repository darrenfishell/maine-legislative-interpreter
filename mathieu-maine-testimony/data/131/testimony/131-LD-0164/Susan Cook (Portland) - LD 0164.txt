LD 164
Dear Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
  I am writing to you in support of the LD164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and 
Protection Fund. I am a Maine resident who enjoys the beauty and recreational opportunities 
available to residents and visitors to Maine lakes and ponds, and am concerned about 
maintaining the health of Maine lakes for all who live in, around, and above them - fish, 
birds,flora, fauna, and humans. 
  Members of the Pitcher Pond Association in Lincolnville and Northport devote time and 
resources to educating residents about good practices for healthy lakes as would be 
addressed by LD164. Of continuing concern are the costs of major repairs to aging septic 
systems and potential amelioration of the impact of invasive species taking hold. 
  As President of the Pitcher Pond Association, as well as a Maine resident who is concerned 
about the potential loss of habitat, recreational opportunities, and the economic benefits of 
healthy lakes throughout the State, I urge the Committee to support this bill.
   Thank you.
   Susan Cook
