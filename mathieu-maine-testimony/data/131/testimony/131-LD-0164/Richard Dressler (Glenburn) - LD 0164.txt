Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources
Re: LD 164
My name is Richard Dressler and I am writing in support of LD 164 - An Act to Fund the 
Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.  I am a resident of Glenburn and live year 
around on Pushaw Lake in Penobscot County.
For more than a decade, I have been a member of the Greater Pushaw Lake 
Association (GPLA).  GPLA’s mission is to preserve and improve the quality of 
Pushaw Lake and Little Pushaw Pond.  We represent almost 800 households and four 
towns around these lakes.  GPLA volunteers have been working hard to: assess water 
quality through routine water testing throughout each summer; work cooperatively with 
landowners through our volunteer LakeSmart program to reduce pollution of lakes from 
runoff and failing septic systems; monitor for invasive plants; and prepare two 
newsletters each year to inform the public about our efforts and to solicit their support.  
These and other efforts are needed to keep our lakes clean for all users, including 
wildlife, boating and fishing, and to maintain property values on the lakes for landowners 
and for towns relying on property taxes.
Resources currently available to protect our lakes are limited so the funding proposed in 
LD 164 is needed to keep our efforts going.  We and other organizations, such as Lakes 
Environmental Assoc., Maine Lakes and Lake Stewards of Maine, etc. rely heavily on 
assistance from Maine Department of Environmental Protection to keep our lakes safe 
and clean.  Please invest in the healthy future of Maine’s lakes to protect our lakes 
for all who use lakes in the future.  The funding provided in LD 164 will help 
assure a healthy future for Maine’s precious lakes and ponds.
Thank you for acting favorably to approve this funding!
Richard Dressler
Glenburn, Maine
