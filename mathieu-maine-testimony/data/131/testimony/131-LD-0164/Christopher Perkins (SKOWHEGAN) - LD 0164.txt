LD 164
I would like to express my strong support for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake 
Restoration and Protection Fund. As a board member of the Lake Wesserunsett 
Association and a seasonal resident of the lake I've developed a passion for doing 
what is necessary to protect Maine's lakes. With an ever-growing number of Maine's 
lakes being infected with algae blooms and milfoil, including several close to Lake 
Wesserunsett, it is imperative to pass LD 164.
