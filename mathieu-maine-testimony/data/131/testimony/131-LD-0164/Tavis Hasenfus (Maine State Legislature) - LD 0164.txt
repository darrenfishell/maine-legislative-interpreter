Testimony of Rep. T avis Hasenfus introducing 
LD 164, An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund 
Before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee 
Senator Bremier, Representative Gramlich and distinguished members of the Enviromnent and 
Natural Resources Committee. My name is Tavis Hasenfus, and I represent House District 57 
and the communities of Readﬁeld and Winthrop. I am here before you today as a cosponsor for 
LD 164, An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund. 
Maine lakes have signiﬁcant importance to me, and I strongly believe that the health of our lakes 
is paramount to the future of our state. I come from a district with approximately 10 great ponds 
and lakes. These lakes are cherished by residents and visitors alike. We also have one of the most 
at-risk lakes in the State for invasive aquatic species; Cobbossee Lake is threatened by an 
infestation of Eurasian water milfoil, variable leaf milfoil and frog bit. 
These infestations, if left untreated, will turn our favorite swimming, paddling and boating areas 
into ﬂoating carpets of unnavigable weeds. 
Not only do these infestations, algae blooms and other water quality problems jeopardize 
Maine’s natural beauty, but they have the potential to wreak havoc on our economy. 
A large portion of municipal revenue comes from assessing property taxes on the many 
waterfront properties here in Maine. However, we have seen the values of lakefront properties 
located on heavily infested lakes decline signiﬁcantly. This not only harms the property owners, 
but it harms the municipalities and citizens that rely on the property tax revenue to fund essential 
services. 
In Vermont, a milfoil infestation decreased lakefront property tax values by an estimated 16%‘. 
Of more concern is the impact infestations can have on Maines lake recreation industry that 
brings in more than a billion dollars annuallyz . 
If we allow our lakes to fall victim to invasive species and pollution, We will lose this vital 
income which so many of our rural communities rely on during the summer. 
District 57: Readfield and Winthrop
Many of these local communities recognize the importance of their lakes and have created 
nonproﬁts and associations designed speciﬁcally to protect the water quality of their lakes. Just 
last year, over one million dollars was raised by community members to address water quality 
issues on Cobbossee Lake. 
The effort is being made locally, but our communities cannot do this alone. 
This bill injects a substantial amount of money into a long-underfunded lake protection fund. 
This will spur signiﬁcant fundraising efforts by allocating money to match the funds 
communities raise on their own. The beauty of this bill is that it rewards those communities that 
are willing to put in the work. These community organizations are the experts in how best to 
keep their waters clean, and reinvesting into the lake and restoration fund is one way the state 
can be a good partner. 
Maine’s fresh water quality is highest in the country3 . I am extremely proud of this, but if we fail 
to invest in our magniﬁcent natural resources we may not be able to pass them on to the next 
generation. I ask my colleagues on this committee to vote in favor of this bill, which will help 
keep our lakes clean. 
Thank you for your time and attention. I am happy to answer any questions you may have for 
me.
