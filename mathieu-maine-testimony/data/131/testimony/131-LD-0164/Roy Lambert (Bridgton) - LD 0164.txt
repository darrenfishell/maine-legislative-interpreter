LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Roy Lambert and I live in Bridgton. I am asking for your support today 
for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
I have spent the last few years devoted to lake protection, acting as the volunteer 
LakeSmart coordinator for Lakes Environmental Association and as the LakeSmart 
coordinator for Woods Pond in Bridgton.  I know how fragile our lakes are and that 
their continued beauty and health can not be taken for granted.  Maine’s lakes are the 
engine of Vacation Land and should be respected as our state’s most valuable asset.
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and 
increased development pressure are putting Maine's lakes at more risk than ever 
before. Funding for lake protection projects - such as implementation of Best 
Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive 
species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms - are
desperately needed to safeguard lake health for the future. 
Please invest in the healthy future of Maine’s lakes today to protect local economies, 
outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife 
habitat and so much more for all who use lakes in the future. 
Sincerely, 
Roy Lambert
