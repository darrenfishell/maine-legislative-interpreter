I encourage passage of LD !64 to fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.  As 
treasurer of the Georges Pond Association in Franklin, Maine, I have helped raise 
over $300,000 to pay for alum treatments of our small lake.  Fortunately, we have had
excellent results and have reduced the threat of algal blooms considerably, but more 
work needs to be done, including addressing the problem of aging and poorly 
functioning systems.  And Maine has hundred and hundred of lake that need to have 
funds to maintain water quality.  This bill will go a long way toward providing 
desperately needed money to protect and preserve Maine lakes and ponds.  Thank you
for your support.
