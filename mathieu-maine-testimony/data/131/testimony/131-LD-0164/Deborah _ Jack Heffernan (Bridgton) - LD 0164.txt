LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
We are Deborah & Jack Heffernan. We have lived year-round in Bridgton on a 
Highland Lake peninsula for 40 years and are dedicated stewards of our precious 
environment. My husband has been in Maine since 1938, when he first arrived as a 
camper on Long Lake. We are asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to 
Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund. Clean and healthy waters are not 
only Maine's greatest treasure, they are the foundations of our economy. 
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and 
increased development pressure are putting our lakes at greater risk with every 
passing day. Funding for lake protection projects, including implementation of Best 
Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive 
species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms are 
desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming decades. 
Please invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local economies, 
outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife 
habitat and so much more for all who use lakes in the future. We are not able to testify
in person for health reasons, but we sorely would like to be with you. 
Signed, 
Deborah Daw Heffernan and Jack (John V.) Heffernan
