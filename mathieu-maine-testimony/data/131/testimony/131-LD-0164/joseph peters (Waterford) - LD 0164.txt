We began vacationing in Maine in 1974, we fell in love with a little cabin on a little lake.  We 
were but 'kids' but promised each other that if a property came up for sale we would do 
anything to buy it, it did, and we did.  Since 1980 we have owned lakefront property and 
through all the rigors of life, we kept hold of this precious piece of land that became sacred to 
us.  LEA has guided us through the years in proper management and to show our 
appreciation, I (an Architect) provided services pro bono. Please help the coming generations
enjoy what we have had for almost 40 years. 
In the words of Wil Rogers, "God made the land and he ain't making any more of it".
