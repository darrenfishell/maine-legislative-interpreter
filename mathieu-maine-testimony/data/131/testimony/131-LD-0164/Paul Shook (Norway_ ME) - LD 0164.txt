LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Paul Shook and I live on Little Pennesseewassee Pond in Norway from May to 
October. I am asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration 
and Protection Fund.
I am also a board member on the Lake Association of Norway, and personally conduct water 
quality measurements each month on four lakes in Norway, Maine 
as a volunteer trying to protect our fragile lakes and ponds. We have seen some disturbing 
trends in recent years in some of Maine's treasured lakes. My pond, also known as "Hobbs 
Pond" has unfortunately seen cyanobacteria blooms in 2021 and 2022 for the first time in 
history. This is devastating for what has always been a very pristine pond. We are 
desperately trying to reverse the effects of pollution and development which is no doubt 
affecting the health of this lake.
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and 
increased development pressure are putting our lakes at greater risk with every 
passing day. Funding for lake protection projects, including implementation of Best 
Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive 
species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms are 
desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming decades.
Please invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local economies, outdoor 
tourism, sporting, and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife habitat and so 
much more for all who use lakes in the future.
Respectfully submitted, 
Paul Shook
