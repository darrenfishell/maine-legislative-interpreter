I am president of the Thompson Lake Environmental Assoc.. Thompson Lake is a 
very valuable resource for our community.Our organization has multiple 
environmental programs : Courtesy Boat Inspections, Water quality and testing, 
Youth Conservation Corps, LakeSmart, Milfoil Mitigation, Education which are 
critical to preserve this natural resource. Funding is vital for us to continue these 
programs. We urge you to support this bill which will promote this type of funding.
