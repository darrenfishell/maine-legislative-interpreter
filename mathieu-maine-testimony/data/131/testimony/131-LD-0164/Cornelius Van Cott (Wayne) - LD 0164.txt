LD 164
   Wholeheartedly and enthusiastically, I urge you to support LD 164 and help preserve the 
quality of Maine's precious, beautiful lakes.  My family has been summer residents on 
Androscoggin Lake for more than 60 years and has seen the detrimental result of algae 
blooms and phosphorus runoffs into this lake and others.  Increasing frequency of heavy rain 
/ snowstorms is bound to challenge relentlessly the healthiness and attractiveness of Maine 
lakes, inviting inevitably heavy costs for cleanup.
   Funds invested now on behalf of Maine lakes will pay dividends to Maine's future economy. 
Maine's lakes are showing the adverse effect of manmade intrusions.  Please act 
foresightfully and correctly to give your support to LD164.   Thank you!!
