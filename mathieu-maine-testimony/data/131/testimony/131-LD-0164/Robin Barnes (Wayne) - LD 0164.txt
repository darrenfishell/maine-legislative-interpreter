Dear Chair Brenner and Committee Members:
        Through more than four generations members of my family have enjoyed the beauty and 
other benefits of Androscoggin Lake in Wayne.  Our much-used seasonal cottage is a place of 
great significance to us.  In addition, we have been and remain invested in the Town of Wayne 
and in central Maine generally, where our family and community connections are both numerous 
and deep. 
       I write to request your support for LD 164, "An Act to Fund the Lake Resoration and 
Protection Fund."  This bill is coming up at a crucial time for Maine lakes, and for Androscoggin 
Lake in particular.  This body of water is facing a crisis, most obviously evident in a recent huge 
algae bloom and in the discovery of invasive plants.  Development around its shores has 
increased the danger of harmful runoff every year.  
       Protecting this and other Maine lakes should be a high priority for everyone with a stake in 
the region.  The health of these waters is vital to that of people as well as wildlife.  At a very 
basic level, local economies depend on maintaining these natural resources.  
       I strongly encourage you to help serve the best interests of Maine, both the land and its 
people, by supporting LD 164.
Respectfully,
Robin B. Barnes
