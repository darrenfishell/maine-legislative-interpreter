LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
I am a Maine resident with a family property on Cobbossee Lake in W. Gardiner. I 
am asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration 
and Protection Fund.
Having witnessed 30 years of change on this beautiful lake, the threats to this lake and
others across the state are real. The effects of warming waters, longer growing 
seasons, larger rain events, and increased development pressure are putting our lakes 
at greater risk with every passing day. Funding for lake protection projects, including 
implementation of Best Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, 
stronger invasive species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic 
algae blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming decades.
Please invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local economies, 
outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife 
habitat and so much more for all who use lakes in the future.
Signed, 
Drew Morris
