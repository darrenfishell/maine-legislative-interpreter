LD 164
Hello-
As a native Mainer and property owner, I would like to express my support for 
funding LD164.
I have traveled to all 50 states and around the world and have come back to realize 
that Maine's most prized possession is the quality of the water in the lakes, ponds, 
streams and rivers. Maine's water is better than most places and we need to keep it 
that way!
Maine needs to protect its most prized possession. It drives tourism, people love to 
visit Maine lakes. Clean water is a quality of life improvement for residents. 
Please prioritize this and support LD164!
