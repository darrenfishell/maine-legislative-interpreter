Dear Members of the Environment and Natural Resourc es Committee,  
 My name is Richard Tucci. For the past 68 years I h ave had the privilege to spend 
days of my summers on the pristine shores of Lake A ndroscoggin in Wayne, 
where I plan to retire. I am asking for your support  today for LD 164: An Act to 
Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.  
In just the last five years weâ€™ve witnessed a tremend ous and alarming change in 
conditions impacting the quality of the water in our  beloved lake. Monsoon rains 
have poured more nutrients into the lake encouragin g abnormal algae growth. 
Heat waves have led to algae blooms closing parts of  the lake to swimming and 
no doubt endangering wildlife including our beloved loons and eagles that make 
their homes on and around the lake. 
ALIC (Androscoggin Lake Improvement Corporation) is  our non-profit advocate for 
saving the lake. They have done a remarkable job on  a shoe-string budget. They 
need your help and need it now to take steps that wil l preserve the lake and 
continue its legacy as a prime example of the beaut y of Maine lakes. 
Maine is a true vacationland, and its livelihood an d future prosperity will be in 
jeopardy without more funding to support lake restor ation and preservation.  
I implore you to use your power to give groups like ALIC the boost needed to 
continue their critical role and projects that will safeguard Maine lakes for many 
more generations. 
Sincerely, 
Richard F. Tucci
