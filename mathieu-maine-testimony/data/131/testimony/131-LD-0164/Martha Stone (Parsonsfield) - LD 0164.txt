Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Martha Stone and my husband and I own a home on Long Pond in Parsonsfield, ME 
that our family visits year-round. I am asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund 
the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
I have experienced firsthand the need for funding to protect and restore Maine’s lakes and 
ponds. I am currently a member of the Long Pond Association (LPA) Board.  Along with Long 
Pond residents and the surrounding community, the LPA completed an alum treatment of Long 
Pond in June 2022.  Leading up to the treatment, I was a member of the fundraising committee 
that raised over $380k to fund our needed alum treatment to address algae blooms and water 
clarity issues that had been plaguing our pond.  
We continue to monitor our water quality and implement best practices to prevent runoff into 
the water.  Many homeowners have participated in the Lake Smart Award program.  Hopefully 
we will not need another treatment for many years, but it would certainly be helpful if funding 
was available should the need arise.  Should this funding act pass, it will make it a lot easier for 
other lake communities to address the issues they may be experiencing without having to rely 
so heavily on private contributions.  
Please invest in the healthy future of Maine’s lakes today to protect local economies, outdoor 
tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife habitat and so 
much more for all who use lakes in the future.
Signed, 
Martha Stone
