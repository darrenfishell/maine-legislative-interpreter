LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is _Susie Albert________ and I live in/spend the summer in 
______Bridgton, Maine_______. I am asking for your support today for LD 164: An 
Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and 
increased development pressure are putting our lakes at greater risk with every 
passing day. Funding for lake protection projects, including implementation of Best 
Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive 
species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms are 
desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming decades. 
Please invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local economies, 
outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife 
habitat and so much more for all who use lakes in the future. 
Signed, 
_____Susie Albert______________
