Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is James W Flynn, I have lived a lifetime on and off Keoka Lake in Waterford of Oxford County, 
and my grandparents go back 100 years by this lake. I lived on and spent summers and most holidays in 
Waterford on Keoka Lake and reside there. My ancestors and family still live on and love this lake 
maintaining shoreline properties.
 I am asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
Protecting our Lake protects our Towns, and our way of life depends on our vital lakes.
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, more significant and destructive rain events, 
and increased development pressure put our lakes at greater risk with every passing day. Funding is 
needed for lake protection projects.
implementing Best Management Practices
replacing failing septic systems
more robust, stronger invasive species management programs
treating lakes with chronic algae blooms
Please invest in the healthy future of Maine’s lakes and towns today to protect local economies, outdoor 
tourism, sporting, and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife habitat, and so much 
more for all who use lakes in the future. 
Thank you for your attention to my concerns, 
Sincerely,
James w Flynn
