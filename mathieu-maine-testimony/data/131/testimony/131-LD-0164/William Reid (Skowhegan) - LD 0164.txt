Dear Members of thr Environment and Natural Resources Committee:
We are writing you in support of LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection 
Fund.
Our family has been fortunate enough to have and enjoy camps on Wesserunsett Lake (Madison) 
and Moosehead Lake (Lily Bay) for six generations, dating back for about 100 years. We have 
over the decades seen development and poor land uses in the watersheds of many lakes result in 
degradation of water quality leading to algae blooms. These could have been prevented. 
Our family has participated in the water quality monitoring program for Wesserunsett Lake since 
1982.  We have been active in the Lake Wesserunsett Association (LWA) and its various 
committees over the years. The LWA was fortunate to have Colby College conduct a land 
use/water quality study in 2000. The study’s report concluded that the lake was “at a critical 
stage in the eutrophication process” and that its future water quality was “uncertain”. It stated 
that the lake had reached “… the threshold at which ecologically detrimental algal blooms can 
occur” and presented a number of recommended actions which the LWA has attempted to 
implement. Over 20 years after the report, however, we are still at the same stage as lack of 
funding for preventive measures has been lacking. .
The proposed funding is not only essential for improving lakes that are already degraded but also 
for preventing lakes such as Wesserunsett from being further impacted. Funding actions to 
prevent degradation is much more cost-effective than spending money for restoration. It will be 
money well-invested. We therefore urge passage of this bill.
