LD 164
I would like strongly urge you to pass LD 164 An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and 
Protection Fund. Along with many other volunteers, I have been working for over three 
decades to protect the Belgrade Lakes of central Maine from growing threats to their water 
quality and from a growing list of invasive species, most recently invasive aquatics that have 
taken over many lakes in the northeast.
Back in the 1980s and 1990s, we had a robust Lakes Division of Maine DEP to bolster our 
efforts, but no more. As the threats grow larger, we ask for the additional financial support this
bill can provide to us for our effort to maintain these jewels of our natural environment for all 
Mainers to enjoy. Thank you.
