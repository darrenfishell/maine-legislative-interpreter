LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Mary Maxwell, I have owned lakefront property in Bridgton for more 
than 25 years. I am asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the 
Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
I have spent years devoted to lake protection.  I have served on the Woods Pond 
Association Board, Bridgton.  Our mission is to protect, preserve and enhance the 
water quality of Woods Pond.   I have spent many years conducting Courtesy Boat 
Inspections at the Woodspond boat ramp and organizing Invasive Plant paddles 
through out lake region working closely with Lakes Environmental Association.  My 
husband I have been the official loon counters for Woods Pond for 15  years and have
started the Loon Ranger program to protect the loons during nesting season. 
I know how fragile our lakes are and that their continued beauty and health can not be
taken for granted.  Maine’s lakes are the engine of Vacation Land and should be 
respected as our state’s most valuable asset.
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and 
increased development pressure are putting Maine's lakes at more risk than ever 
before. Funding for lake protection projects - such as implementation of Best 
Management Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive 
species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms - are
desperately needed to safeguard lake health for the future. 
Please invest in the healthy future of Maine’s lakes today to protect local economies, 
outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife 
habitat and so much more for all who use lakes in the future. 
Sincerely, 
Mary Maxwell
