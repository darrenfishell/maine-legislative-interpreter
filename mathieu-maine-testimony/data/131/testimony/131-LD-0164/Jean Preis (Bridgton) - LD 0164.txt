LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Jean Preis. I am asking you to support LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake 
Restoration and Protection Fund.
My husband and I are year round residents of Bridgton. We live on the shore of Highland 
Lake where, for 36 years, we have owned and operated a summer cottage rental business. 
For all those years I have also volunteered with Lakes Environmental Association as a water 
quality monitor for Highland Lake. 
Today you will hear about many threats to Maine's lakes, and those threats are real. 
Local businesses such as ours depend on having clean healthy lakes, but our lakes are under
increasing pressure. There are well-known ways to protect the lakes, but it will take money to 
fund such things as implementation of Best Management Practices, replacement of failing 
septic systems, stronger invasive species management programs, and even treatment of 
lakes with chronic algae blooms. It will be money well spent!
Please support LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
Thank you.
Signed, 
____Jean Preis_______________
