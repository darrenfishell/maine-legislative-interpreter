Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Tom Larned, president of the Kennebunk Pond Association, representing 174 homeowners 
around Kennebunk Pond, Lyman, York County.
Our association has worked relentlessly for the past twenty years at least, trying to maintain and 
improve the water quality in Kennebunk Pond.  Under the supervision of York County Soil and Water 
Conservation District, we started with a watershed survey in 2003, identifying non-point source 
pollution problems within the watershed.
Lake Stewards of Maine has trained over 20 of our members to search out and identify invasive plant 
species.  
Maine Lakes has trained our water quality monitor to provide scientifically accurate measurements of 
the visibility through a water column using a secchi disk, as well as training several of our members to 
provide LakeSmart evaluations to lakeshore owners who request them.  The education those evaluators 
provide to those homeowners helps solve any existing issues that might be adversely affecting the water 
quality and prevent future concerns.
Those agencies and programs all need money to operate.  Kennebunk Pond Association
Please support LD164 to help protect Maine’s lakes…for all of our sakes.  
Tom Larned
