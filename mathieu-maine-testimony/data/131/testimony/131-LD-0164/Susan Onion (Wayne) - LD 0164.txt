LD 164
Dear members of the Environmental and Natural Resource Committee,
My name is Susan Onion and I am asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act 
to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
As a Maine resident, I have spent my entire life living on the lakes of Maine.  
As a high school student, I spent summers teaching swimming lessons in pristine 
Clearwater Lake in Industry and canoeing at the YMCA Camp on Lake Cobbossee. 
As a college student, I enjoyed camping, swimming and canoeing on lakes and rivers 
across the state of Maine. As an adult I have volunteered for over a decade as a 
certified Invasive Plan Patrol surveyor and volunteer team leader collecting data for 
Wilson, Dexter, Berry and Parker Ponds.   I have volunteered as a Courtesy Boat 
Inspector and have participated in the Lake Smart program.  
In these many years of relationship with lakes and rivers across the state, I have seen 
an increase in algal blooms caused by warming waters and nutrient loading, an 
increase and spreading of invasive plants as they hitchhike on boats from one water 
sources to the next, and an increase in erosion caused by runoff due to extreme 
weather.  We need resources to help respond to these environmental impacts on our 
waters.  
The waterways of Maine are essential to our economy, our wildlife, our health, our 
humanity and our joy. The funding provided by LD 164 is necessary and desperately 
needed to protect our waterways for the future of Maine.  
Sincerely,
Susan Onion
