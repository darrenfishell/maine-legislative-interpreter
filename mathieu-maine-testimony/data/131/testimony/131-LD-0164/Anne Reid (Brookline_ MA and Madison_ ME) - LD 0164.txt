Dear members of the Envir onment and Natur al Resour ces Committee,
My name is Anne Reid and I spend the summer on Lak e Wesserunsett in Madison
Maine.  I am asking for y our suppor t today for LD 164: An Act t o Fund the Lak e
Rest oration and Pr otection F und.
I volunteer for the Lak e Wesserunsett Association and ha ve spent almost e very summer
of my lif e on the lak e, as my mother and gr andfather did befor e me.  I hope my daughter
will do the same, but we need help k eeping our lak e waters healthy .  The eff ects of
warming waters, longer gr owing seasons, lar ger r ain e vents, and incr eased de velopment
pressur e are putting our lak es at gr eater risk with e very passing da y. Funding for lak e
protection pr ojects, including implementation of Best Management Pr actices,
replacement of failing septic systems, str onger inv asive species management
programs, and tr eatment of lak es with chr onic algae blooms ar e desper ately needed t o
safeguar d lak e health in the coming decades.
Please inv est in the healthy futur e of Maine â€™s lak es today to protect local economies,
outdoor t ourism, spor ting and r ecreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlif e
habitat and so much mor e for all who use lak es in the futur e.
Signed,
Anne Reid
