RE: LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund
Dear Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
We’ve lived in South Berwick for over 30 years and have owned a small camp in 
Unity, Maine since 2017 but have enjoyed summers there since 2000. In that time 
we’ve seen numerous negative changes and issues at the Unity Pond. We’re asking 
for your support for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection 
Fund.
The effect of warming waters, longer growing seasons, stronger rain events, and 
increased development pressure are putting our lakes at greater risk every single day. 
Funding for lake protection projects, including implementation of Best Management 
Practices, replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive species 
management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms are 
desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming years.
Please invest in the healthy future of Maine’s lakes today to protect wildlife habitat, 
local economies, outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water 
supplies and so much more for all who use and appreciate lakes in the future.
Yours truly,
Pamela and Cormac McCarthy
