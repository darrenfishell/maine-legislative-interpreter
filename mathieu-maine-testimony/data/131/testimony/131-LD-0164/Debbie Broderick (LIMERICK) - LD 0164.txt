Dear Members of the Committee,
My name is Debbie Broderick and I live year round on Lake Arrowhead in York Country. I am 
passionate about maintaining natural ecosystems. I am a member of the Lake Arrowhead 
Conservation Council and I am a certified Invasive Plant Patroller through the Lake Stewards 
of Maine. I do very frequent and regular surveys of our lake. Since becoming a patroller of our
littoral zone in 2020, I have discovered 2 new invasive plants in our lake, in addition to the 
already well-established Variable water-milfoil that we have been trying to manage for at least
17 years.
It is clear to me that our DEP is in dire need of funding and staff to help local 
conservation organizations control and manage their lake infestations. It is of vital 
importance that we HALT the spread and contamination of other pristine waterbodies 
from infected lakes like ours. To this end, we need funding to increase the presence 
and effectiveness of boat inspectors, as well as much needed boat cleaning stations at 
infested lakes.
It is my belief that increased funding will go a long way to achieving this goal. Please 
help us preserve the purity of our water bodies by funding the DEP's efforts.
Many thanks for your time and consideration,
Debbie Broderick.
