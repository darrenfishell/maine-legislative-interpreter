LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
Kimberly and David Hallee live in Waterville and our seasonal camp is on McGrath Pond in 
Oakland. We are asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake 
Restoration and Protection Fund.
For 13 years as LakeSmart trained evaluators we have been teaching property owners 
effective ways to manage and care for their property to prevent runoff which causes algae 
growth, green slime, water quality and pocketbook loss! Additionally, David has conducted 
Secchi disc readings which indicate water clarity on  our beloved McGrath Pond and Salmon 
Lake. Kimberly, RN has devoted  43 years  to Maine's healthcare and Hospice programs in 
Central ME. David, CPL, CAL, CPS dba Boy Locksmith continues to proved security services 
in Central ME and beyond. His father founded the company in 1975! As Volunteers we 
continue to teach healthcare  of our lakes hoping to ensure security of our lake water quality, 
community prosperity and  coveted quality of life. 
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and increased 
development pressure are putting our lakes at greater risk with every passing day. Funding 
for lake protection projects, including implementation of Best Management Practices, 
replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive species management programs, and 
treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health
in the coming decades. 
Please invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local economies, 
outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife 
habitat and so much more for all who use lakes in the future. Thank you. Sincerely, 
Kimberly and David Hallee.207-873-5285. khallee@gwi.net, 12 Gray Street
