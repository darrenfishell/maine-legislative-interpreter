Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Samantha Pierce and I live in Nobleboro, Maine on Damariscotta Lake. I am 
asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the Lake Restoration and 
Protection Fund.
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and increased 
development pressure are putting our lakes at greater risk with every passing day. Funding 
for lake protection projects, including implementation of Best Management Practices, 
replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive species management programs, 
and treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake 
health in the coming decades. 
These warning signs have affected the lake that provides my livelihood. I work at a year-
round camp on Damariscotta where cyanobacteria blooms have limited campers ability to 
swim in the lake as well as their ability to learn about the ecosystem. 
Please invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local economies, 
outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife 
habitat and so much more for all who use lakes in the future. 
Signed, 
Samantha Pierce
