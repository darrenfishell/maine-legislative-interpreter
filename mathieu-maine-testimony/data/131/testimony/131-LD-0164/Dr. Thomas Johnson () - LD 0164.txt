My Name is Dr. Thomas Johnson and I live on Sabbathday Lake in New Gloucester and have
lived here for over 50 years. My wife and I and several neighbors started the Sabbathday 
Lake Association in the mid 1970's.Our first priority was to establish a water quality research 
committee. We were fortunate in having as a neighbor . Dr Russel, a Boston College 
chemistry professor who served as the first chairperson
. Since that time members of the association have been very active in doing what we could to 
maintain high quality lake water
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, longer rain events and increased 
development pressure are putting Maine lakes at greater risk with every passing day. Funding
for lake protection projects are desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming 
decades.
Please invest in the healthy future of Maine's lakes today to protect local economies, outdoor 
tourism, sporting and recreation businesses, wildlife habitat and much more for all who use 
lakes in the future.
