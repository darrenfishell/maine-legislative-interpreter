Dear Members of the Natural Resource Committee
My name is Elaine Philbrook and I live on China Lake. I am asking for your support for LD164:An Act
to Fund the Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
The effects of warming waters, longer growing seasons, larger rain events, and increased development 
pressure are putting our lakes at greater risks with every passing day. Funding for lake protection 
projects, including implementation of Best Management Practices, replacement of failing septic 
systems, stronger invasive species management programs, and treatment of lakes with chronic algae 
blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health in the coming decades.
Please invest in the healthy future of Maineâ€™s lakes today to protect local economies, outdoor tourism, 
sporting and recreation businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife habitat and so much more for all 
who use lakes in the future.
Signed,
Elaine Philbrook
