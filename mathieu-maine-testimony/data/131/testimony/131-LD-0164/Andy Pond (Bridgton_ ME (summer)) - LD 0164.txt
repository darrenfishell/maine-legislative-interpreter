Bridgton, ME (summer)
LD 164
Dear members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Andy Pond and I spend the summer in Bridgton, at our camp on beautiful
Woods Pond. I am asking for your support today for LD 164: An Act to Fund the 
Lake Restoration and Protection Fund.
As homeowners (and we consider Woods Pond home as long as the road to camp is 
open!) we have invested in improving our property--recently getting a LakeSmart 
award for planting native blueberries and improving lanscaping to prevent runoff. We 
are committed to being responsible stewards to our local environment. 
We hope that the legislature will similarly invest in the ensuring that the lakes we love will be 
there for future generations
 
Funding for lake protection projects, including implementation of Best Management Practices,
replacement of failing septic systems, stronger invasive species management programs, and 
treatment of lakes with chronic algae blooms are desperately needed to safeguard lake health
in the coming decades.
.  
This bill will help protect local economies, outdoor tourism, sporting and recreation 
businesses, drinking water supplies, wildlife habitat and so much more for all who use lakes 
in the future. 
Thank you for your time and attention
