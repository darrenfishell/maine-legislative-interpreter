Testimony in Support of LD 685
An Act to Codify That Freedom of Access Act and Freedom of Information Act Requests Are Not
Hate Crimes 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary:
I, Nathan Gould of Winterport, am writing this testimony in support of LD 685, “An Act to 
Codify That Freedom of Access Act and Freedom of Information Act Requests Are Not Hate Crimes.”
In the First Amendment to our Nation’s Constitution, the right to petition our government is 
enumerated alongside those other rights fundamental to a free people. Working in tandem with that 
right is the ability for citizens to hold their government accountable. The Maine Freedom of Access Act
ensures we have open government, but this must not be defeated by spurious claims of hate crimes.
Prejudice and crimes motivated by it are a serious matter, and it is a shame to weaken the 
severity of such an issue by loosely applying allegations of hate crimes for the purpose of countering 
unwanted petitioning, disliked free speech, or disapproved free thought. No governmental board, 
commission, or agency should fear the truth; allow the public the unhampered right to access those 
materials and records permitted by the FOAA and the FOIA and let truth speak for itself.
LD 685 will protect our fundamental right to hold our government accountable by ensuring our
laws conducive to such rights are not thwarted. Let us not cheapen those legitimately heinous acts of 
hate, and let us safeguard the People of Maine’s right to a fair and open government.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
