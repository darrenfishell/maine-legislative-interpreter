LD 685
Dear Chairs and members of the Committee,   I am writing to urge a yes vote on LD 
685, "An Act to Codify That Freedom of Access Act and Freedom of Information Act
Requests Are Not Hate Crimes." 
What does MSMA have to hide? A non-profit entity created in 1971 to lobby the 
Legislature for more funding for the K-12 monopoly, that does not want to be held 
accountable for how our tax dollars are being spent.  This is outrageous!  Parents, not 
government have every right to know everything that is going on in schools 
concerning their children's curriculum's, library books, what kind of counseling their 
children are now secretly receiving.  Our children do not belong to the Government, 
State run schools, they have been given to us by God and we as parents are given 
authority and stewardship over them.
Also, as tax payers, we have a "right to know" exactly how are tax dollars are being 
spent. Since when is it a "hate crime" to ask questions, esp to groups who claim to be 
transparent and should be? It is a hate crime to push CRT, DEI, SEL, and every other 
agenda upon our children, rather than teaching them academics, unlike what EDU 
commissioner believes, and has spoken about recently.
This is all being exposed, parents and grandparents in Maine are outraged. With one 
voice we are all saying, "enough of this assault on families and children!" Can you 
hear us, and will you respond to the majority? We are standing and we are fighting 
and all involved are going to be held accountable!
I am urging strong support of LD 685
