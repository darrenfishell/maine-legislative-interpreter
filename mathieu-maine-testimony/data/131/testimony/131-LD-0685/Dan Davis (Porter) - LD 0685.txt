LD 685
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee,
I am providing testimony in support of LD685, and represent no entity or agency other than 
myself as a resident, property owner, taxpayer, and voter.
The past two (2) years of pandemic isolation has resulted in an unintended side effect. 
Federal and state shutdown policies put authoritarianism on overdrive in our smaller local 
governments and subsequently fostered a loathing of public participation. 
For Maine to re-calibrate and right the ship away from this poor behavior, we should be 
strengthening FOAA, defending public participation, enhancing the public tools to recall 
derelict officials, and evaluating how many of our local governments used pandemic federal 
funds to purchase and install facial recognition and wire-tapping equipment that violates 
numerous Maine Laws.
I urge the Committee to vote Ought To Pass on LD685 to defend public participation and 
access to government.
Thank you.
Dan
