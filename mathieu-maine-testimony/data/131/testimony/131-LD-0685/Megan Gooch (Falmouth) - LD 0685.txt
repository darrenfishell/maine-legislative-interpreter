I would like to testify that FOAA requests pertaining to ANY school board matters are NOT 
hate crimes/hate speech.  Parents should have the right to know what is being taught in their 
children's schools.  There is no reason for this lack of transparency.  It will only increase 
parents' distrust of our schools administrators.  I implore you to protect our children by 
codifying that Freedom of Access Act and Freedom of Information Act requests are not hate 
crimes.
