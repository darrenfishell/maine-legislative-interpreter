LD 685
  The public schools in Maine no longer concentrate on teaching Math, Reading, Writing, 
Science & English. The primary objective in most public schools now is to indoctrinate 
students in the insane cult of Wokeness.
     United States students in public schools now have some of the lowest proficiency scores 
in the world. As employers will tell you, many of our public school graduates no longer have 
the basic skills to earn a living in the real world.
     I am encouraging all Legislators to support Representative Andrews's bill LD 685: An Act 
to Codify the Freedom of Access Act and Freedom of Information Act Requests are not hate 
crimes.
