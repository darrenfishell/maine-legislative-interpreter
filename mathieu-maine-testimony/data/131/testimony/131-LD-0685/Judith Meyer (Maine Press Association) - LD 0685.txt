Judith Meyer. I am the editor of the Sun Journal in Lewiston, the Kennebec Journal and the Morning 
Sentinel. 
I am here today on behalf of the Maine Press Association to speak neither for nor against LD 685, 
An Act to Codify That Freedom of Access Act and Freedom of Information Act Requests Are Not 
Hate Crimes. 
* * *
Maine Freedom of Access Act requests are not hate crimes. Federal Freedom of Information Act 
requests are not hate crimes.
Public access requests do not fit the statutory definition of a hate crime, which is focused 
specifically on force or threat of force against an individual based on “race, color, religion, sex, 
ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation or homelessness.”
Public access requests are requests to inspect or copy public records in the possession of a 
government entity, and while an individual at the government entity responds to the request, the 
request is not directed to an individual but to the governmental body. 
Maine’s hate crime statute outlines what “is” a hate crime in general terms, and does not delineate 
what “is not” a hate crime with any specificity; adding such specificity would alter the statute’s 
current structure.
The Maine Press Association has a great deal of respect for the public access process and abhors 
any abuse of FOAA or FOIA either by the requestor or by the body receiving a request. But, requests 
for public access are not hate crimes by the definition of hate crimes here in Maine.
Is there a way for this committee to issue a legislative-level statement that FOAA and FOIA are not 
hate crimes without drafting such specificity into law? Or, perhaps there is another avenue to make 
it clear that requests for public access to government documents and proceedings in Maine is a 
right and not a crime?
