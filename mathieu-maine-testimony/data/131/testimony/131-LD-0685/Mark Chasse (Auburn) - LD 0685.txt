LD 685 ought-TO-pass as it appears the constitutionally protected right of exercising 
free speech, making inquiries about public matters and being involved in children's 
education is being labeled by a public servant as "hate speech", so that the people of 
Maine need to strengthen our rights by introducing a bill to explicitly codify our 
second ammendment in no uncertain terms.
Thank you.
