RE:   Support for LD 1266 --- Pet Insurance 
 
 
 
The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC)1 and its members, thank you for 
the opportunity to express strong opposition to legislation referenced above and urge you vote ought 
to pass.  
This legislation builds upon Maineâ€™s enactment of a Pet Insurance statute last year by allowing for a 
pet limited line option for insurance producers holding life and health producer licenses.  This measure 
expands access and Bringing greater certainty and clarity to these policies will help the marketplace 
for these products and benefit Maine pet owners and their furry friends. 
For these reasons, NAMIC respectfully requests you vote ought to pass on LD 290.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.  
 
1 The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies consists of more than 1,500 member companies, 
including seven of the top 10 property/casualty insurers in the United States. NAMIC member companies 
write $357 billion in annual premiums and represent 69 percent of homeowners, 56 percent of automobile, 
and 31 percent of the business insurance markets.
