Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 1518.
I am a lifelong Maine resident with three children in the public school system. I have 
found my own public school education (in the early ‘90’s) to serve me well. I believe 
that public school can provide a solid foundation of early learning to help all Maine 
students prepare for the challenges of Higher Learning and/or adulthood in general.
It has recently been an issue of national attention that public schools have been 
promoting ideologies that many Americans disagree with. Everyone agrees that kids 
should be taught the basics of reading, writing, math, history, etc. Many Americans, 
like myself, consider that when teachers start promoting ideologies that run contrary 
to the values of parents, they are crossing a line of public trust.
Parents should be provided transparency with what their children are taught in school 
and when the lesson conflicts with the parents' views, the parent should have the right 
to opt their child out of that learning.
I would like the public school system in Maine to serve all Maine families, which is 
why I support this bill..
Please deem LD 1518 “Ought To Pass”.
