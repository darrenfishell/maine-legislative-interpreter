While this bill purports to prevent “controversial viewpoints”, its effect will be to limit diversity education, prevent discussion of structural racism, and ultimately result in a censored view of American history. American Atheists believe that our nation’s schools should promote critical thinking, limit censorship of ideas, and prevent the white-washing of racial and religious history. We urge you to stand up for the education of our young people and oppose this harmful bill.   American Atheists is a national civil rights organization that works to achieve religious equality for all Americans by protecting what Thomas Jefferson called the “wall of separation” between government and religion created by the First Amendment. We strive to create an environment where atheism and atheists are accepted as members of our nation’s communities and where casual bigotry against our community is seen as abhorrent and unacceptable. We promote understanding of atheists through education, outreach, and community-building and work to end the stigma associated with being an atheist in America. As advocates for religious equality and free speech, American Atheists objects to efforts to censor history, undermine diversity education, and erode diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.  LD 1518 is particularly harmful in that this bill allows parents to opt their children out of any class or instruction based on the parents’ religious or moral beliefs. For example, a parent might opt a student out of biology classes (if they have religious objections to evolution), history classes (if they disagree with the characterization of the US Civil War), geography (if they believe the Earth is flat), or even math (if they agree with the language in the Bible that implies π is 3). This is no way to run a school – and it would be a nightmare for teachers and administrators.

phone  908.276.7300 fax  908.276.7402 www.atheists.org Critical thinking skills are an essential part of education in the United States and contribute to informed civic engagement and thoughtful debate. Censoring discussion of “controversial” topics in a classroom setting would stifle the evolution of students’ belief systems and views on these complex issues. Without a complete and accurate conversation on these ideas, students will never be able to think for themselves and come to their own conclusions about the subject matter. Further, nearly every issue in America’s history could be called “controversial,” preventing a thorough, detailed history from ever being taught correctly. Recent survey research confirms a broad bipartisan majority of Americans:1   ● Want students to learn a thorough, accurate, and fact-based account of American history; ● Trust teachers to thoughtfully teach the hard parts of history; ● Believe racism is widespread and harmful to society and that schools have a responsibility to teach students that racism is wrong; ● Want to reduce political division; and ● Want schools to ensure all students feel they belong and see themselves reflected in the curriculum.   Teaching about the issues of the day, matters that actually affect the lives of students and their families, can be an important way to invest students in their education and to connect the subjects they are studying to issues of significance in our nation’s public discourse. Teachers, especially in areas like civics, social studies, and history, have a responsibility to teach critical thinking and to prepare students for full participation in our society and democracy. Deep engagement with so-called “controversial” subjects, including, for example, legislation or policies that affects the education of students themselves, can be an important way to encourage democratic participation and to bring these sometimes-abstract subjects to life.   If we look back on history, issues that would be deemed “controversial” under this definition include the institution of slavery,2 racial segregation,3 women’s suffrage,4 and many others. The idea of “controversial issues” would interfere with teaching over subjects as well, such as history. Some party platforms have propagated the ahistorical ideology of Christian nationalism, the idea that American was founded as and remains a Christian nation.5 This, of course, conflicts with the history of the American Revolution and the founding of the United States as taught in many classes. Would history teachers be required to provide Christian nationalist propaganda to compensate?   1 Minimizing Misinformation About History and Social Studies. Learn From History. (2021, September 24).

This type of bill would effectively censor and white-wash accurate dissemination of American or world history. In order for students to help our country move forward, they have to be aware of America’s past, even the not-so-glamorous parts. As an organization in favor of religious liberty, American Atheists oppose these bans in schools, and we ask that you do as well.   This bill would incentivize a censored teaching of our nation’s history, tie the hands of the educators we trust, and virtually eliminate discussions of structural racism. The quality of instruction, critical thinking skills of students, and sense of belonging of all students will suffer.  This bill, which effectively bans “controversial viewpoints”, would ban a discussion of race and racism in the United States. Legislators should be trying to improve robust discussions in classrooms, instead of limiting them. Students should be able to have rich conversations concerning history in order to develop their critical thinking skills, and legislators should not be trying to limit those conversations.   In short, there is no need for this poorly conceived bill. We urge you to reject LD 1518. Rather than silencing instruction, trust and equip teachers to do the important work of delving into difficult discussions around race and a comprehensive understanding of our nation’s complex racial history and similar conversations. If you have any questions regarding American Atheists’ opposition to LD 1518, please contact me at bwilliams@atheists.org.    Sincerely,   Brittany Williams State Policy Counsel American Atheists
