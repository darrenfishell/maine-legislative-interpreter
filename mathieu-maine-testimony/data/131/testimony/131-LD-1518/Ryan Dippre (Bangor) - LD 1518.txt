LD 1518
I am writing in opposition to LD 1518: “An Act Regarding the Rights of Parents to 
Withdraw Their Children from Public School Classes or Activities that Include 
Certain Controversial Viewpoints.”  This bill as structured does not address any 
“controversial viewpoints” that are actually presented and discussed in any schools 
that I have ever been in as a student or teacher.  However, the effect of this bill will be
to silence discussions of diversity, equity, and inclusion.  This would have a negative 
impact on student learning.  We should want to learn more about one another, to put 
ourselves in another’s shoes, so that we can have a better understanding of one 
another and, as a result, build stronger communities.  This bill would hamper that 
already-difficult task, and therefore ought not to pass.
