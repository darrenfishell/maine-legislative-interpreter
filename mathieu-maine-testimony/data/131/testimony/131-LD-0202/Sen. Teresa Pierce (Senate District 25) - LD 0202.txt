Testimony in Support of LD 202, "An Act to Clarify the Requirements for Off -
premises Sales by Cannabis Store  Licensees"  
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs  
January 30, 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative  Supica, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs, I am Senator Teresa Pierce, and I represent senate district 
25, which includes Falmouth, Cumberland, Gray, North Yarmouth, part of Ya rmouth, and Long  
Island. I am pleased to present LD 202, "An Act to Clarify the Requirements for Off -premises Sales 
by Cannabis Store Licensees .” This is a bill brought to me by the Department of Administrative and 
Financial Services , and I’m happy to sponsor it here today.  
 
This legislation provides a clearer and more organized framework for the regulated sale of cannabis 
products at specified events.  This department bill was submitted to address gaps that were identifie d 
in LD 1927/PL 2021, ch. 735,  which authorized off -premises sales of adult -use cannabis products . 
 
The Office of Cannabis Policy (OCP) was tasked with creating regulations to put the ac t into 
practice, but  it became evident that further clarity was needed before the rulemaking process could be 
completed. In response, this  emergency bill was submitted  to promptly resolve the statutory 
deficiencies and all ow OCP to draft effective rules, in accordance with the laws that have already 
been passed.  
 
This bill is a crucial step in ensuring that the Cannabis Legalization Act is properly implemented, and 
it will enable OCP to provide the necessary structure and clarity for cannabis stores to participate in 
specified events . I strongly urge the Committee to consider th is bill and support its passage.  
 
I am happy to answer ques tions , but I know the OCP  representative here today will be able to speak 
on the specifics of this bill.  
 
Sincerely , 
 
Teresa S. Pierce  
State Senator, District 25  
Serving the people of Falmouth, Cumberland, North Yarmouth, 
Yarmouth (majority), Gray, and Long Island
