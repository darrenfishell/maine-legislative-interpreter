Testimony of Maine Public Health Association  Neither For Nor Against : 
LD 202: An Act to Clarify the Requirements for Off -premises Sales by Cannabis Store Licensees  
 
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs  
State House, Room 437 Monday, February 6, 202 3 
 Good morning, Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. My name is Rebecca Boulos. I am a resident of South Portland and executive director of Maine Public Health Association.  MPHA is the state’s oldest, largest, and most diverse association for public health professionals. We represent more than 700 individual members and 60 organizations across the state. The mission of M PHA is to improve 
and sustain the health and well -being of all people in Maine through health promotion, disease prevention, and 
the advancement of health equity. As a statewide nonprofit association, we advocate, act, and advise on critical public health challenges, aiming to improve the policies, systems, and environments that underlie health inequities – but which also have potential to improve health outcomes for all people in Maine. We are not tied 
to a national agenda, which means we are responsive to  the needs of Maine’s communities, and we take that 
responsibility seriously.  MPHA is Neither For Nor Against LD 202: “An Act to Clarify the Requirements for Off -premises Sales by 
Cannabis Store Licensees.” In the 130
th legislature, we opposed LD 1927 , which allowed for off -premises sales 
of adult use cannabis and adult use cannabis products, due to conc erns about increased risks to public health. 
More specifically, we expressed concerns about enforce ment  challenges, including restricting youth access , and  
ensuring that legal -age adults we ren’t using these products at the venue where they were purchased. While we 
do not have concerns with the current bill, LD 202, which clarifies policies related to off -premises sales of adult 
use cannabis, as written; we do want to raise again the public health concerns of off -premises cannabis sales, in 
advance of the wo rk session, as there appeared to be discussion at the hearing about expanding the scope of the 
bill. 
 Youth Perception of Risk  
With increasing social acceptance of cannabis use , we see decreases in the perception of harm among  youth. 
Compared to the perception of harm from binge drinking, daily drinking, and any prescription drug misuse, which have remained stable, perceptions of harm related to using cannabis  one to two times per week have 
decreased from 2009 to 2019 from 42% to 33% a mong high school students.
1 The 2019 MIYHS asked, “How 
much do you think people risk harming themselves (physically or in other ways) if they smoke cannabis  once or 
twice a week?” 38% of middle schoolers and 67% of high schoolers answered, “Slight risk” or “No risk,” an increase for both groups in no perceived risk compared to 2015 and 2017.

 Youth Use  
The 2019 MIYHS reported that 8.5% of middle schoolers, and 36.4% of high schoolers have used cannabis  
(18.1% of middles schoolers report their first time was before age 11; 16.6% of high schoolers report their first 
122 State Street, Augusta, ME 04330 • 207- 808-0487 • mainepublichealth.org  time was before age 13) ; this is an incr ease from 2017 (6.9% and 32.6%, respectively).2 These same data show 
that past -30-day use among Maine high school students was 22.1%. W hile e -cigarettes are the most widely used 
tobacco product among U.S. youth,3 a study from the U.S. C enters for Disease C ontrol and Prevention found 
that nearly 9 in 100 students reported vaping cannabis . Based on this survey, researchers estimate that nearly 1 
in 3 U.S. high school students who use e -cigarettes have already used cannabis .4 This is particularly 
problematic because the THC in vaporized oils and waxes can be 4- 30 times higher than dried cannabis .4  
 
Adult Use  
Cannabis  use among adults is also increasing, with past month use among adults more than doubling from 8% 
(2012- 2013) to 17% (2017- 18). While we often think of substance use initiation happening in young people , 
almost 25 % of people in 2020 who initiated cannabis  use in the past year were aged 26 and older.5 There are 
problems associated with adult  cannabis use in Maine. For example, in 2020, in Maine, there were 5,625 
cannabis -related emergency department visits, a 21% increase from 2019.6 Rates were disproportionately higher 
for males and for people ages 18 to 25 years old.  Health Consequences  
The health consequences from this increased use are significant. People who used cannabis heavily in their teens 
and continued through adulthood showed a significant drop in IQ between the ages of 13 and 38 years – an average 
loss of 8 points for those who met criteria for cannabis dependence.
3 Cannabis  adversely impacts adolescent brain 
development, is a risk factor for cardio- respiratory disease and testicular cancer and is associated with both 
psychiatric illness and negative social outcomes .7,8  Cannabis has also become much more potent; samples studied 
from 1995 to 2014 show that while the level of THC increased by 300%, the amount of CBD decreased by 50%.9  
 We have additional concerns about cooccurring use of cannabis and alcohol. A recent study found that college 
students that use alcohol and cannabis simultaneously were more likely than students who didn’t use them simultaneously to experience c ognitive, academic, social, and self -care effects; blackouts, vomiting, risky 
behavior, driving under the influence, and physical dependence.

As we stated in our testimony for LD 83 , at a fundamental level, we also have concerns about the health impacts 
of smoking cannabis and second- hand cannabis smoke exposure. Indeed, there are carcinogens in cannabis smoke; 
these pose health risks to the person smoking and to others in proximity. According to the U.S. CDC , “smoked 
marijuana delivers THC and other cannabinoids to the body, but it also delivers harmful substances, including 
many of  the same toxins and carcinogens (cancer -causing chemicals) found in tobacco smoke, which are harmful 
to the lungs and cardiovascular system.” These toxins include mercury, ammonia, cyanide, lead, and formaldehyde, as well as hazardous fine particles.  
 Again, while MPHA is Neither For Nor Against LD 202 in its current form, we are strongly opposed to any 
efforts that rollback Maine’s strong smoke -free public places laws – whether tobacco or cannabis. We also 
oppose efforts that would increase youth access t o cannabis products or put greater strain on enforcement efforts 
without a concurrent increase in funding and resources. Thank you for considering our testimony.
