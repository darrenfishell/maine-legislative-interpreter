Senator
Brenner,
Representative
Tucker,
and
Honorable
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Environment
and
Natural
Resources,
My
name
is
Nancy
Smith,
I
live
in
Ellsworth,
and
I
am
the
CEO
of
GrowSmart
Maine.
We
are
a
statewide
non-partisan
non-profit
organization
helping
communities
navigate
change
in
alignment
with
smart
growth.
We
advocate
for
comprehensive
policies
and
funding
for
smart
growth
practices
and
outcomes.
Our
support
for
this
bill
is
grounded
in
the
fact
that
sound
development
practices
support
thriving
growth
areas
and
natural
and
working
lands
in
every
Maine
community.
Municipal
subdivision
rules
constitute
sound
land
use
planning
in
outlining
a
process
for
local
stakeholders
to
consider
short
and
long
term
implications
for
subdividing
a
parcel
of
land
for
development.
LD
596
exempts
from
subdivision
rules
those
instances
where
subdivision
regulations
would
be
triggered
by
the
protection
of
working
and
open
space.
This
makes
perfect
sense
as
these
uses
support
community
goals
without
creating
challenges
related
to
development,
for
which
the
subdivision
review
process
was
created.
Working
farmland
and
forests,
as
well
as
open
and
recreational
lands
offer
benefits
including
economic
stability,
climate
resilience,
fiscal
health,
and
personal
wellness.
This
bill
streamlines
the
process
for
willing
landowners
to
protect
lands
for
these
purposes.
GrowSmart
Maine
will
assist
the
committee
in
any
way
that
is
helpful.
