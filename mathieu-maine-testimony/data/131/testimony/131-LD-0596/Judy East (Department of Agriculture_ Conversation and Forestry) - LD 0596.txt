NATURAL RESOURCES  
IN SUPPORT OF  LD 596 
An Act to Exempt Certain Conservation Lots from Municipal Subdivision Review  
 
  April 5 , 2023  
 
Senator  Brenner , Representative  Gramlich , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on  
Environment and Natural  Resources , my name is Judy East , and I am the Director of the Bureau of 
Resource Information and Land Use Planning  in the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry . I am speaking  in support of  LD 596, An Act to Exempt Certain Conservation Lots from 
Municipal Subdivision Review , for the reasons outlined below.  
 
This bill amends the definition of a subdivision to exempt parcels from subdivision review if they are 
created for conservation purposes and do not subvert the purposes of the subdivision law.  
 
There is an existing definition  in Title 33 (MRS 33 ยง476. 1 ) that references the purposes of a 
conservation easement with the same language  that is proposed in the bill :  
1.  Conservation easement.   "Conservation easement" means a nonpossessory interest of a 
holder in real prop erty imposing limitations or affirmative obligations the purposes of which 
include retaining or protecting natural, scenic or open space values of real property; assuring its 
availability for agricultural, forest, recreational or open space use; protecting  natural resources; 
or maintaining or enhancing air or water quality of real property.   
 
Rather than defining the purposes separately in Title 30 -A, the LD could reference the existing 
definition in MRS 33 ยง476. 1.  
 
Also, for reference , the service area of the Land Use Planning Commission, governed by Title 12 682 
B. 3.  https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/12/title12sec682 -B.html  has a similar provision  to the one 
proposed by this bill : 
 
3.  Transfer to conservation organization .  A lot or parcel transferred to a nonprofit, tax -
exempt nature conservation organization qualifying under the United States Internal Revenue Code, 
Section 501(c)(3) is not considered a subdivision lot if the following conditions are met:   
 
 
 A. For a period of at least 20 years following the transfer, the lot or parcel must be limited by 
deed restriction or conservation easement for the protection of wildlife habitat or ecolog ically 
sensitive areas or for public outdoor recreation; and    
B. The lot or parcel is not further divided or transferred except to another qualifying nonprofit, 
tax-exempt nature conservation organization or governmental entity.  
 
Thus, the  proposal would  bring Titles 12 and 30 -A into alignment with respect to providing an 
exemption for subdivision review on  a division of land subject to a conservation easement.  
 
Thank you for considering  this issue . We will be available to answer questions at the work ses sion.
