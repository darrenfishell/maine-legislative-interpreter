LD 1320
Dear esteemed members of the Veterans and Legal affairs committee, 
I write in support LD 1320, as anyone who is committed to expanding and improving 
democracy should do. For too long, Unenrolled (Independent) voters have 
undemocratically been denied a voice in supporting candidates that reflect their 
values. Those people who choose to not align with any particular party, should not be 
forced to register with a party in order to support a candidate that they feel should 
have a chance to run for office. Forcing people to register with a party to sign for a 
candidate they favor is in direct conflict with their First Amendment rights, related to 
freedom of association.
Consistent with your duty to serve your constituents' interests, please support LD 
1320 as common sense legislation to improve democracy.
Respectfully, 
Justin Beth
