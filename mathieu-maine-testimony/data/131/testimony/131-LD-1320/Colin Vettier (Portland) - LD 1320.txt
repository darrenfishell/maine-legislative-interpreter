LD 1320
Dear Committee member, 
My name is Colin Vettier and I live in Portland Maine. 
I'd like to share with you the various reason why I support LD 1320. Unenrolled 
voters already have the right to participate in primaries, but they currently have no say
in who gets on the ballots. That is not full participation and this needs to be corrected. 
Unenrolled voters they should be allowed to sign primary petitions. 
Besides, unenrolled votersâ€™ taxes pay for primaries and they make up 33% of 
registered voters. 
I hope that you will strengthen Maine's democracy by allowing unenrolled voters to 
fully participate. Pass LD 1320. 
Kindly.
