Unenrolled Voters to Sign Petitions for Party Candidates  
TESTIMONY TO OPPOSE LD1320. LINDA HASKELL
NO, NO, NO!!! This is a disgusting attempt to destroy the fundamental voting rights 
of the enrolled parties. Are there no principles of the legislative majority of the State 
of Maine? This is a "NO". TESTIMONY TO  OPPOSE! LINDA HASKELL
