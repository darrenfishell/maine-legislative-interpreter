Testimony in Support of LD 1697 
"An Act to Implement Background Checks for School Board Members" 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs: 
My name is John Andrews and I represent District 79 in Western Maine. I am here to present my 
bill LD 1697, “An Act to Implement Background Checks for School Board Members”. 
This bill requires newly elected school board members and school board members upon 
reelection to submit to a ﬁngerprint-based background check with screening requirements 
identical to those required for coaches and substitute teachers. 
I believe it is equally important that We do our due diligence by doing backgrounds the people 
we elect to local school boards as it is for teachers and coaches. Many of the people who are 
elected will have access to the schools, make important decisions on policy, and have sway with 
the local superintendent. I would hate to think that someone with a criminal record or with 
serious transgressions against them would be able to make important decisions for the children 
within our communities. 
I know it is probably a small number of cases, where an issue might fall through the cracks on 
someone who isn’t ﬁngerprinted or have a background check completed, however I d0n’t think 
that is a chance we should take with our children. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, I would be happy to answer any questions you may 
have. 
Respectfully, 
John Andrews 
State Representative 
District 79 Paris, Sumner, West Paris and Woodstock
