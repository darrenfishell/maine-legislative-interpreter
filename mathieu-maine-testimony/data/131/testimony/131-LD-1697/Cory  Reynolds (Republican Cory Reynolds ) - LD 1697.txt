LD 1697
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing: My name is Cory Reynolds I am testifying today in Support Of LD-1697 - 
An Act to Implement Background Checks for School Board Members. 
I believe we need to keep our children safe in the schools and by doing that we need 
to make sure our school board members take a background check to see if they are 
capable of being on the school board. A few weeks ago a school board member in 
Maine was seen flipping off parents that were trying to speak up about what was 
happening in there kids school. That is unacceptable for a school board member to do 
when we are trying to show the students how to achieve a good life. from doing what 
she did is not showing a good example. So please I ask you to vote ought to pass on 
LD-1697. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
