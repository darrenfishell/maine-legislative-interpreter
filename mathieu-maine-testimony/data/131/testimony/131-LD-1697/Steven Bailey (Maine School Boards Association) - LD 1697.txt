TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO 
L.D. 1697 
AN ACT TO IMPLEMENT BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director for Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Superintendents Association and Maine School Boards 
Association, in opposition to L.D. 1697. 
MS SA and MSBA are both opposed to L.D. 1697 that would require background checks for school board 
members. Currently, background checks are required for those school persomiel who work directly with 
students. All persomrel employed by the school district have this requirement. School board members cannot 
be employed by the school district that they serve. School board members have an oversight responsibility of 
the school district. They have a supervisory responsibility of the superintendent. Therefore, school board 
members are not to have ongoing direct contact or supervisory responsibilities for interacting with students. 
Districts do use the State Police record checks when volunteers seek the opportunity to provide help within 
the schools. This same process can be used with and for school board members. The current requirements for 
being a school board member is to be l8 and be a resident of the municipality/state for the position being 
sought. 
Municipal officials are elected and are not required to have background checks. Legislators are elected and are 
not required to have background checks. 
This is an unnecessary task and cost that could be a barrier for some candidates to serve on their local school 
board.
