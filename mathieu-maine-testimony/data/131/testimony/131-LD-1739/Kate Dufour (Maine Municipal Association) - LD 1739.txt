Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1739 , An Act to Extend Development District Tax Increment Financing Districts  
 
May 10, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony neither for nor against LD 1739  on behalf of 
the 70 municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Associa tion’s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal 
interest.   
Municipal officials appreciate the creative approach in LD 1739 seeking to 
simultaneously address the financial impacts of the expiration of a tax increment fin ancing ( TIF) 
district and associated benefits  on the community , as well as the need for increased investment in 
affordable housing and transportation.  However, the concern among local leaders is that  the 
extension of the benefit for an additional 30 years may be deem ed too generous by communities 
that do not or cannot use TIF .  This may p ut this important, and in most communities  the sole , 
economic development tool at risk.  
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about ou r position, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 1-800-452-8786.
