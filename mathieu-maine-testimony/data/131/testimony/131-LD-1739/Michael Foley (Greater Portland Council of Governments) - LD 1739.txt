Re Support of LD 1739, An Act to Extend Development District Tax Increment Financing Districts 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and Members of the Taxation Committee, 
Please accept this letter as the testimony of the Metro Regional Coalition (MRC) which voted 
unanimously this week to support LD 1739, An Act to Extend Development District Tax Increment 
Financing Districts 
The MRC lS a longstanding collaboration between the cities of Portland, South Portland, and Westbrook, 
and the towns of Cape Elizabeth, Falmouth, Gorham, and Scarborough, staffed by the Greater Portland 
Council of Governments The MRC focuses its work on issues impacting Greater Portland, from housing 
and homelessness to municipal and regional partnerships wherever possible 
For many years the MRC has worked to address the growing issue of unaffordable housing costs in our 
region The MRC communities have worked together to support each other as we advanced housing 
strategies that increase affordability of houses and apartments for low-and moderate-income and 
working families 
We have made progress, but much more remains to be done LD 1739 proposes to allow municipalities, 
at their discretion, to extend expiring tax increment financing districts if the extended TIF is focused on 
affordable housing and transit TIF purposes 
We believe LD 1739 will effectively focus expiring TlFs on the state's housing and public transportation 
priorities, producing a benefit to state policy and local finances It's a win-win that we encourage you to 
endorse by passing LD 1739 
Thank you for the opportunity to share our views, and please let me know if the members of the MRC 
can provide anything more to support your important work on this issue 
Siniirely,

COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS 
Testimony of the Greater Portland Council of Governments 
In Support of 
LD 1739, An Act to Extend Development District Tax Increment Financing Districts 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Grohosk|, Representative Perry, and Members of the Taxation Committee, my name IS 
Christian Roadman, Senior Planner at the Greater Portland Council of Governments (GPCOG) 
I am here today to speak on behalf of GPCOG in support of LD 1739, An Act to Extend Development 
District Tax Increment Financing Districts 
GPCOG serves 25 municipal members in Cumberland County, from Sebago Lake to Casco Bay, as well 
as Saco, Biddeford, Arundel, and Old Orchard Beach through the Portland Area Comprehensive 
Transportation System (PACTS) We deliver transportation, land use, sustainability, and economic 
development services to our members and their communities Earlier this week GPCOG's Metro 
Regional Coalition, comprised of the cities of Portland, South Portland, and Westbrook, and the 
towns of Cape Elizabeth, Falmouth, Gorham, and Scarborough, voted unanimously to endorse LD 
1739 and to urge you to do the same 
Extending expiring tax increment finance districts with a focus on affordable housing and transit will 
facilitate responsible development benefiting lower-income and middle-class Mainers Our 
municipalities suffer from an acute lack of housing, and we need more tools to ensure its production 
in areas ready for development 
As you know, many housing projects need financial support to make the economics work, LD 1739 
would help in that regard by enabling housing TlFs The bill would also encourage more widespread 
use of T|Fs to spur development in regionally appropriate areas served by relevant infrastructure and 
transit 
As a regional planning agency, GPCOG sees the need to support more housing at every level of 
affordability with resources like those proposed in LD 1739 At a meeting yesterday, several 
municipal representatives noted that LD 1739 is a significant opportunity for expanding housing 
choices in our region 
GPCOG is working with our member communities to implement the state-level housing policy 
changes that began last year with LD 2003 As we do, we often find our members asking what more 
they can do to bring forward housing that all parts of the community can afford 
LD 1739's enactment Wlll add another valuable policy tool to the municipal housing toolkit, and for 
that reason we urge you to vote ‘ought to pass’ on LD 1739 
Thank you for the opportunity to share our support for this bill, and please let me know if we can do 
anything to advance your work on this important legislation
