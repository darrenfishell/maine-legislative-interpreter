LD 1249
Dear Judiciary Committee Members,
Please vote Ought to Pass on LD 1249 and protect women from the dangers of 
gaining abortion-inducing drugs and devices through the mail or Telehealth, which 
puts women at risk and removes the accountability of the provider of these drugs and 
devices. 
Please pass LD 1249.  Thank you, Michelle Homchuck (Guilford)
