The most widely accepted definition of abortion involves the ending of human life. 
As a Christian, I believe it is my duty to stand for those who are defenseless and have 
no voice and that the ending of their life is morally wrong. I believe so-called 
telehealth visits which result in the decision to actively end a human life is both coldly
impersonal and morally wrong.
