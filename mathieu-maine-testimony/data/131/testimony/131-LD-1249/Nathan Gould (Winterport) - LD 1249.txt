Testimony in Support of LD 1249 
An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by Prohibiting Physicians 
from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through Telehealth or Other 
Electronic Communication 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary 
My name IS Nathan Gould, and I live in Winterport. I am here to give testimony in 
support of LD 1249, "An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by 
Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through 
Telehealth or Other Electronic Communication " I also support LD 494, LD 771, LD 1197, 
LD 1410, LD 1809, and LD 1614. 
My opinion might be passed over on account of the fact that I'm male and thus 
lacking a uterus Yet what I do have is friends and family who are women, who have 
daughters I want them to be safe, as anyone would want their loved ones to be safe 
It IS the height of irresponsibility to put women at risk by allowing doctors to 
permit unsupervised chemical abortions Chemical abortions are a regression to those 
back-alley procedures often cited as a reason for legalizing abortions The public was 
told abortions must be ”safe and rare." I, being pro-life, wonder If we can't have ”rare," 
shouldn't we at least have ”safe"? 
It strikes me as hypocritical that the Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine would 
suspend a doctor's medical license for taking drastic measures to provide a patient the 
medicine they needed, yet now our State's administration is ﬁxated on providing

certaln dangerous drugs to women. lt was for good reason that m|fepr|stone was 
sublect to the FDA's Rusk Evaluatlon and lV|lt|gat|on Strategles; the r|sk of bleedmg alone

Wlth Monday fresh In your memorles, l hope you see that not just a majornty of 
the People of l\/lame, but also plural|ty —c|t|zens from all parts of our State, from varled 
backgrounds —-stand agamst the excesses and reckless proﬁteermg of the aborhon 
|ndustry We do not want ﬁlthy lucre and monetary galn to be put over the safety of our 
States’ women. Chem|ca| abomons are not what I'd hope for anyone to choose, but 
they are a procedure that should be supervnsed 
W||l Mame be a safe place to ralse a daughter? It IS my prayer the Commlttee wall 
work to make at so. 
l ask the Commlttee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your tlme 
Respectfully,
