Rob Poissant
Gorham 
LD 1249
Hello, my name is Rob Poissant . I reside in the town of Gorham.
Thank you for allowing my testimony today.
I urge you to support L.D. 1249.
Our State of Maine public policy allows for no restriction on a Womanâ€™s decision to 
terminate a pregnancy before viability. After viability an abortion is allowed to 
preserve the life and health of the mother. All Abortions require that only health care 
professionals are allowed to perform them.
L.D. 1249 is essential to prohibit the prescription of Abortion inducing drugs by other
means than by an essential in person health professional.
The risk of harm and wrongful death to the Mother and unborn by any other 
communication such as Telehealth , telephone , and internet invites abuses and 
indicates a lack of genuine love and care for their well-being.
Please support L.D. 1249.
Thank you.
