LD 1249
 A woman should Always be seen in person by her physician to determine her health 
and to be examined before making any recommendations, much less  being prescribed
a drug that is life altering. Yes, indeed it is - for the baby indeed and the mother. A 
mother should never have to deliver a dead baby, alone and without medical care, 
which is what happens with the RU486 pill. 
  Mail-order drugs should be made illegal.
  I fully support Rep. Paul's LD1249, "An Act to Protect the  Quality of  Care 
Provided by Telehealth". 
Thank you
