LD 1249
Sen Carney, Rep. Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Renee Fortin, I live in Lewiston
I am writing in support of LD 1249 - An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided 
via Telehealth by Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs 
or Devices Through Telehealth or Other Electronic Communication
Summary: This bill prohibits the prescription of an abortion-inducing drug or a device
designed to produce an abortion by telehealth, telephone, the Internet, or other type of
digital communication and the shipment of an abortion-inducing drug or a device 
designed to produce an abortion by mail, express delivery service or other means of 
interstate commerce and makes a violation of this prohibition a Class C crime and 
subjects a person who violates the prohibition to civil liability for wrongful death and 
medical malpractice and to any relevant professional disciplinary proceeding.
It increases the ease of access with little accountability, treating a pregnancy like a 
headache or some minor illness. A pregnant mom can obtain a chemical abortion 
online via telehealth, without a single visit to a doctor before or after the abortion.
Itâ€™s not safe for women. Abortion related complications are four times more likely 
during a chemical abortion than a surgical abortion, and 20 percent of women will 
experience some complications. More can be seen here about the risks:

and rare!
