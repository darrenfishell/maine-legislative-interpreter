Dear Judiciary Committee,
Telehealth is a good thing to help those that may not be able to get adequate care 
when ill.  However to allow telehealth to permit the death of a child is evil and 
dangerous.  Would you support telehealth to give drugs for suicide that could be 
shipped across state lines?  This is worse.  You must protect innocent life and this 
process of not even seeing a woman and prescribing drugs to kill a child is 
unthinkable. 
Please support this bill!
Sincerely,
G. Frank and Susan R. Strickland
