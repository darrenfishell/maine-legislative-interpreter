Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Maine Committee on 
Judrciary I am Wendy Memll from Benton. 
I am here to testlfy iii support of LD 1197, An Act to Prevent C0ercedAb0rt10n 
The State of Mame has a powerful duty to ensure a dectslon to abort 1s voluntary, 
Wnihout pressure, or coercion. Studies show that up to 66% of women abort 
because of pressure from someone else (l_'ﬁjpS //tmyu rl com/l\/ilCoercaonBan) A 
women pressured to abort is not making tlns dec1s1on for herseltl Just last mght,a 
woman told me that her husband coerced her mto abortmg her last baby by 
threatemng to leave her and their hvmg chﬂdren. She chd abort, but here she is 40 
years later, lamentzng that she caved to that pressure, snll mourmng the loss of her 
baby, and regretting havmg that abornon He ended up leaving her anyway 
In my role as Executrve Dnector of a pregnancy help center, I have walked Wrth 
numerous women through the process of healing after abornon. Most of those 
women felt coerced to abort then baby A piece of health 1s mental health, Many 
Women suffer from mental health 1ssues after a coerced abomon To rgnore thts 1s 
nresponsrble and cmel 
If we truly are about Women & Women’s nghts, about a woman's right to choose, 
then We must be domg everythmg we possibly can to ensure women are making 
abortion dec1s1ons after they have gathered all the facts, have ample trme to 
process them, and are m no way pressured to end the hfe of then" baby Awoman 
who as coerced 1s not makmg her own chorce. 
I urge you to vote ‘YES’ to LD 1197, as well as to LD 494, LD 771, LD 1249, LD 
1614, and LD 1809. Thank you
