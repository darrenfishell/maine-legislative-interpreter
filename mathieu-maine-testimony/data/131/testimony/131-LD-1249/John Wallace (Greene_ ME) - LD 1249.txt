LD 1249
I support LD 1249. This bill protects the quality of care provided via telehealth by 
prohibiting physicians from prescribing abortion-inducing drugs or devices through 
telehealth or other electronic communication. 
Without this bill a pregnant mom can obtain a chemical abortion online via telehealth 
without a single visit to a doctor before or after the abortion. Furthermore, chemical 
abortions are four times more likely to produce complications compared to surgical 
abortions. 
Finally, the current lack of accountability for prescribers opens the door to fraud and 
abuse, allowing potential abusers to obtain the medication and use it to cause an 
abortion without the knowledge of the mother.
