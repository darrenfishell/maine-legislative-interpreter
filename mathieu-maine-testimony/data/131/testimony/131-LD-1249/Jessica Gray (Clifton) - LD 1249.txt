Good morning! I would like to make known my opinion on the subject of not 
allowing abortion pills and other chemical abortion methods to be prescribed via 
telehealth. I believe all live is precious and the unborn is vulnerable and in need of our
protection. Also, the dangers to the mother with these methods are proven to be 
horrendous. Please vote to protect both mother and child.
