LD 1249
To Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee
Thank you for an opportunity to express my support for LD 1249.
To allow a pregnant mother to obtain a drug-inducing abortion or a device designed to
produce an abortion online via telehealth, telephone, the Internet  or other type of 
digital communication without a single visit to a doctor before or after an abortion is 
showing complete disregard for the health of the mother.  Such action should be 
prohibited and anyone who violates the prohibition should rightly be charged with a 
Class C crime and face civil liability for wrongful death and medical malpractice.
The most severe side effects from a medical abortion start shortly after taking the 
second pill, 24-48 hours after taking the first pill. After both doses of medication have
been taken you can expect the following to occur:
    Bleeding and cramping that starts between one and four hours after taking the 
second pill.
    Heavy bleeding with blood clots for the next several hours.
    Heavy cramping for several hours.
    A low fever or chills that last about a day after taking the second pill. Others report 
feeling tired, nauseas and dizzy, and having diarrhea.
Many women will go through the above all alone with no support and no one to help 
her if there are complications.  
Thank you for reading my testimony.  I urge you to support LD 1249.
