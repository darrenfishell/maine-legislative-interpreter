Charlis Sullivan
Caribou
LD 1249
Representative Reagan Paul and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Charlis Sullivan and I am a resident of Caribou. 
I am here to testify in support of LD 1249, HP0797, An Act to Protect the Quality of 
Care Provided via Telehealth by Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing 
Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through Telehealth or Other Electronic 
Communication.
Abortion by mail, express delivery service or other means may cause wrongful death 
and medical malpractice. This bill supports clients be fully informed of options and 
choices with liberty to choose while being granted necessary time to make a rational 
decision without barriers. 
For this reason, I ask the committee to vote “Ought to Pass” on this LD 1249 and to 
thoughtfully consider allowing patients the opportunity to be fully informed when 
make a life changing decision. Thank you.
