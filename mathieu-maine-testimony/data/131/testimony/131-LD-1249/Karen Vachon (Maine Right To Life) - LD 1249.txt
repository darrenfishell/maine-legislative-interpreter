Senator Carney, RepresentatIve Moonen, and members of the .ludIcIary Commlttee My name Is Karen 
Vachon l am the ExecutIve DIrector of MaIne RIght To LIfe, In Auburn, and a resIdent of Scarborough I 
come before you today to speak In Support LD 1249‘ 
Thank you, Rep Paul for Introduclng thIs legIslatIon There Is a not|on that lIfe's challenges can easIly be 
solved by convenIently poppIng a few pIlls Women In MaIne deserve so much better than a do-|t- 
yourself chemIcal abortIon An abortIon Is not a headache It shouldn't be taken lIghtly and must be 
treated cornpasslonately and dIfferently 
The abortIon pIll Is known as RU-486 The drug Is called MIfeprIstone, and has been around sInce the 
1980's In Europe, and was approved for sale In the US In September 2000 Under the ClInton 
admInIstratIon, the FDA fast-tracked approval ofthe abortIon pIll used a procedure that was supposed 
to be used only be to speedIly approve drugs needed to treat lIfe threatenIng Illnesses 
Pregnancy Is not an Illness It doesn't treat anythlng It was developed to kIll an unborn chIld and It 
could cause lIfe threatenIng complIcat|ons for women 
Chemlcal abortIon pIlls, termInates a pregnancy up to 70 days gestatlon (measured In number of days 
sInce a woman's last menstrual perlod) As of 2020, 53% of all abortIons performed In the US are 
chemIcal ln Mame, as of 2021, 60% of reported abortIons are chemIcal1 
Abortlon related complIcat|ons are four tImes more lIkely durIng a chemIcal abortIon than a surgIca| 
abortIon, and 20 percent of women wIll experlence some COl'npllC81ZlOl'1S.2‘ 
In 2000, the FDA was aware of at least one maternal death and many serIous sIde effects assocIated wIth 
mIfeprIstone Consequently, they Issued the followIng protocols whIch Include 
IL PrescrIbIng the drug only up to seven weeks of pregnancy 
2 DIspensIng the drug, In person, by a physIcIan who could estlmate the gestatlonal age and check 
for slgns of a ectopIc pregnancy 
§, Requlrlng three doctor vIsIts to monItor the entlre two drug chemIcal abortIon process 
i And requIrIng that serIous complIcat|ons be reported 
Up untIl 2016, doctors who prescrIbed chemIcal abortIon, took responsIbIlIty for the patIent’s case and 
theIr nurses, asslstants, or even receptIonIsts handled the counselIng, screenlng and delIvery of the pIlls

As oflune 30, 2022, the FDA cites 28 reported deaths and thousands of |l'IjLll'eS Despite the deaths and 
lh_|Ul'leS associated with chemical abortions, restrictions and regulations are being relaxed3 
In early January, 2023, the Food and Drug administration (FDA) updated labeling of mifepristone 
(generic for Mifeprx) to allow pharmacies to dispense the drug ln issuing the new regulations, the FDA 
formalized the 2021 decision to permanently drop the in-person requirement for the distribution of the 
abortion pill Thus opening the door to telehealth abortion and mail—order abortion pills 
This move is not in the interest of women's safety In-person questioning and examination are far 
superior to a webcam conversation or an on-line questionnaire, and a professional ultrasound, though 
never required, provides the highest level of safety for women 
For the love, safety, and protection of Maine women, I ask this committee to please support this 
legislation by voting ought to pass Thank you
