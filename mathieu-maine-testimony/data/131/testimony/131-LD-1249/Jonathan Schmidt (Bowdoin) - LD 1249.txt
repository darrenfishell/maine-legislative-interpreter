Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary.  My name is Jon Schmidt, I am a resident of Bowdoin, and I am 
submitting this testimony to express my SUPPORT for LD 1249. 
I support LD 1249 because its provisions, in combination with several other pro-life bills 
currently under consideration, will help to restore common sense safeguards and necessary 
restraint to Maine’s permissive abortion laws.   
Few, if any, drugs prescribed for at-home use produce such invasive and profound 
physiologic effects as the abortion-inducing drugs Mifepristone and Misoprostol.  Glib 
assurances from abortion advocates that these drugs are “safe and effective” ignore the 
very real and sometimes severe health risks associated with their use. Disregarding or 
underplaying these risks puts ideology over science.  Remote methods of medical 
consultation and patient evaluation (e.g. telephone, online, etc.) are neither sufficiently 
thorough, nor adequately verifiable, for prescription of such serious drugs.   
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS.. Thank you.
