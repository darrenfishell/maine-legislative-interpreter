LD 1249
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 1249.
It is 2023 and with the recent Dobbs decision, the issue of abortion is very much up 
for debate across the country. There is no federally recognized right to abortion, as the
Dobbs decision makes it clear that the previous Roe decision was deeply flawed.
The decision for a woman to have an abortion is a serious issue. It's a life or death 
issue. That's why abortion should only be carried out under the careful control of the 
provider.
During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, telemedicine changed and grew in an 
effort to meet people's medical needs when it was not possible for in person doctors 
visits. Telemedicine has some advantages in some situations but as the pandemic has 
shown us, telemedicine can result in lower quality of care and it can be altogether 
ineffective for many situations.
An in person visit could help to identify if a woman is being pressured into an 
abortion, if there's abuse situation, a case of incest or rape.
An in person visit helps to prevent against abortion drugs being given to a third party.
Abortion drugs are not without possible complications or other health side effects for 
the mother.
Please deem LD 1249 in “Ought To Pass”.  Abortion is too big of an issue to be 
handled over the phone or a video call.
