LD 1249
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Linda McMahon I am from Harpswell Maine. I am writing in support 
of.LD 1249 - An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by 
Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices 
Through Telehealth or Other Electronic Communication .
Over the phone/ Internet Care of a pregnant woman is preposterous. It does not allow 
for verification of age of the fetus, nor the true physical condition of the mother. It 
can also lead to unscrupulous characters taking advantage of desperate women and 
girls. 
Please vote ought to pass. Thank you.
