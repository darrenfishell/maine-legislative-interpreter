During the course of discussions on abortion, I have heard for years the refrain that 
the decision of whether or not to choose abortion should be left to a woman and her 
doctor.  I would argue that a person who prescribes abortion-inducing drugs through 
telehealth or other electronic communication is probably NOT the woman's doctor.  
For that matter, the doctor who performs an abortion procedure at an abortion clinic is
likely not the woman's doctor either.  He does not know her, has not met her face to 
face up until moments before the abortion, is not familiar with her medical history or 
her family situation.  He is simply there to perform the abortion after others have 
prepped the woman for the procedure, and then he moves on to the next one.  If she 
has complications afterwards, he may not even be called back to deal with them.  
Allowing abortion through electronic means separates the woman even farther from 
this doctor who is not "her doctor."  How does he know how far along her pregnancy 
is?  Or if she has any complications or other health issues that need to be addressed?  
How does this doctor even know if the woman with whom he is communicating 
electronically is even the woman who will be taking the drugs, or if she is getting 
them for someone else?  If the woman has a bad reaction to the drugs, or has violent 
cramping or profuse bleeding, or if the placenta is not entirely expelled, she is on her 
own.  She is also on her own to dispose of her aborted child.  There is no doctor there 
to monitor the woman's welfare during the abortion process.  In short, the argument 
that this is a decision for a woman and HER DOCTOR to make is a false front.  
Before you vote on this bill, please ask yourself whether your vote benefits women, or
benefits the abortion industry.  If you would protect women, please vote in favor of 
LD 1249.
