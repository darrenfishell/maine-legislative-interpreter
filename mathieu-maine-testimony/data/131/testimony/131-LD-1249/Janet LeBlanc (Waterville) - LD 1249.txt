LD 1249
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Janet LeBlanc and I am a resident of 
Waterville. I am testifying in support of LD 1249.
For decades we have heard stories of “back ally” abortions and how dangerous they 
are.  Abortion via Telehealth and mail order are today’s “back ally” abortion.  Women
are taking prescribed abortion-inducing drugs without the supervision of a trained 
professional.  Some women experience high amounts of bleeding to the point they are
not able to go about their usual routine.  They may also experience vomiting, diarrhea,
and fever.   The destruction of human life in the womb by a chemical abortion can 
make the woman very sick and may need medical attention.  Abortion by Telehealth 
is harmful to women.   Receiving abortion pills in the mail is harmful for women.  
Anyone prescribing an abortion-inducing drug or a device designed to produce 
abortion by Telehealth and other digital communication should face disciplinary 
procedures for committing a Class C crime.  It should also be considered a crime to 
mail these dangerous drugs to anyone.  This bill need to pass to protect women from 
being victims of the abortion industry.
