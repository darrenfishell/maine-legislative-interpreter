                                                                           Sponsored by : - Rep. Reagan Paul of Winterport

Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary. 
My name is Andy Levesque I’m a resident of Gorham, a faithful Catholic, a member of the Knights of 
Columbus, and a board member of Maine Right to Life. 
So we meet again, after Mondays historic show of pro-life Mainers opposing LD1619 which would 
terminate the life of a newborn baby. 
I hope and pray that our sheer numbers will give you affirmation that the majority of Mainer’s do not 
support the Governor’s Bill to kill our newborns. 
Today I support LD494,771,1197,1249,1614 and 1809. 
. 
When a child dies, Abortion is NOT Healthcare. 
I urge you to vote for LD 1614, It’s the right thing to do.
