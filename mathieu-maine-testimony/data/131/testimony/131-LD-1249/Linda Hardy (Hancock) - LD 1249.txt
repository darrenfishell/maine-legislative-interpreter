Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Linda Hardy and I am from Hancock, ME. A lifelong citizen of the Great 
State of Maine, a wife and mother of 4 adult children and 10+ grandchildren. The + 
stands for as yet a new grandchild in its mothers womb.
I would like to speak to the legislation in regard to prohibiting prescribing abortion 
inducing drugs through telehealth. 
This is the most egregious violation of optimal health care that I can imagine.  To 
interview a patient by telephone or video phone to determine whether they qualify for 
these drugs according to the woman or girls perception of their pregnancy is simply 
very bad medicine. I've known a woman who was unaware of her pregnancy up until 
the time she could no longer deny the movement of her child in the womb. This was 
because she continued to lightly menstruate even after she became pregnant. 
These abortion drugs are very dangerous to use beyond the guidelines. Who is going 
to protect the very young girls who very often deny the unexpected and may be wrong
in their estimation of gestation.
These drugs are known to cause severe hemorrhage. 
Also, as a survivor of sexual abuse, and someone who has had to wrestle with PTSD 
throughout my life, what about the women and girls who are not fully informed about 
seeing their little baby expelled from their body, how will they dispose of their own 
baby? How traumatic!!
Please, protect women's health! Please vote ought to pass and stop this type of 
abortion practice.
