LD 1249
I am writing to ask our Senators and Representatives to vote yes on LD 1249 An Act 
to Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by Prohibiting Physicians from 
Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through Telehealth or Other 
Electronic Communication.  I believe this is a time when in person meeting between 
Dr. and patient should be done.  Too many things can get left out of speaking via 
telehealth. How can the physician really know if this person is truly pregnant of if 
they are just looking for drugs for other reasons (to sell and make money).   This is a 
bad idea and I personally believe if you are seeking advice or drugs from a physician 
it should absolutely be done in person.  Thank you for your time and please vote yes 
to pass this bill.
