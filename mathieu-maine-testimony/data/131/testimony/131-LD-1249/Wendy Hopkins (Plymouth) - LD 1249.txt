LD 1249
Honorary members of the Judiciary Committee;
I am writing in support of LD1249 - An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided 
via Telehealth by Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs 
or Devices Through Telehealth or Other Electronic Communication.
Until recently, a doctor would not even prescribe an antibiotic, or any other treatment,
without seeing a patient in person. This protects both the physician and the patient.
It is irresponsible and reckless to allow drugs to be given to a pregnant women 
without a complete examination and an in-person explanation of the what the full 
effects and risks of said drug are! 
Please vote "ought to pass" for LD1249
Thank you for your time and consideration.
