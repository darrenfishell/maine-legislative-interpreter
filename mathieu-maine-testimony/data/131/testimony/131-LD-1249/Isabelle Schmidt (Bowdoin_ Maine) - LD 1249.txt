LD 1249
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
My name is Isabelle Schmidt, from Bowdoin. 
I am writing to speak in support of LD 1249, “An Act to Protect the Quality of Care 
Provided via Telehealth by Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing 
Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through Telehealth or Other Electronic 
Communication.”  
The proposal for a patient’s protection from too-easy access to arbortificiant 
medications, due to having been obtained via telehealth services, is sensible and 
necessary.  Firstly, the provision of such medications via telehealth means is against 
current state law that prohibits abortions after viability unless the life and health of the
mother is certainly threatened.  How can either the health of the mother or even the 
gestation period be properly ascertained solely via a phone or video call?
Any  attending medical professional ought to have the certainty that comes only a 
with an in-person and thorough examination of a patient, with all its aspects, before 
authorizing such a prescription remotely.     
Such a system of transfer for dangerous drugs allows increased potential for 
misdiagnosis by the doctor and accidental or even intentional misrepresentation by the
patient concerning her age, gestation period, or health condition.  Since abortion drugs
are very serious and dangerous by intent and there is not enough knowledge 
concerning the role of mifepristone (in particular) upon full-term fetuses, it may 
constitute malpractice to be so careless in the dispensing of them.
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 1249.  Thank you.
