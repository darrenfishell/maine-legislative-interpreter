LD 1249
LD 1249 - An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by 
Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices 
Through Telehealth or Other Electronic Communication
Position: Support
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Clare Desrosiers, from Linneus, ME. I am submitting testimony in 
Support of LD 1249.
I am asking you to support this bill because it protects women against the dangerous, 
harmful effects of chemical abortion. Nearly half of all abortions in America today 
are chemical abortions. Abortion related complications are four times more likely 
during a chemical abortion than a surgical abortion, and 20 percent of women will 
experience some complications. More can be seen here about the risks:

In addition to health risks, allowing prescription of abortion-inducing drugs via 
teleheath, telephone or internet decreases accountability for prescribers and opens the 
door to fraud and abuse, allowing potential abusers to obtain the medication and use it
to cause an abortion without the knowledge of a pregnant mother. 
Please protect women by voting Ought to Pass on LD 1249.
Thank you.
