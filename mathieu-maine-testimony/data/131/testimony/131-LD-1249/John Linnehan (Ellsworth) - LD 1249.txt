Good MornIng Senator Carney, Representauve Moonen, and Honorable 
Members of the JudIcIary C0mmIttee' 
My name Is John LInnehan of\El|sworth. I’ here to estIfy for myself 
and my wIfe Heather, to urge you to vote "EI;© lI@E _;I§§ on LD 1249! 
I'm statIng my support from a BIblIcal poInt of vIew, from God's PoInt of 
VIew| As a BIble be|IevIng ChrIstIan, I belIeve that the BIble Is the 
InspIred Word of God. A paraphrase of Second TImothy chapter 3 verse 
16 says "All ScrIpture IS INSPIRED by God and teaches us what's right, 
what's NOT right, how to get right and how to stay right " LD 1249 Isa 
perfect example of “what's right"! Remember, thIs IS NOTIust me 
telllng you my opInIon ThIs Is God, Our Heavenly Father, tellIng me AND 
YOU that LD 1249 um @@%I@a§§ 
God's startIng poInt of lIfe Is at CONCEPTION! 
He Is the Creator, the Author of lIfe Psalms chapter 139 verses 12-15 
says ”You made all the delIcate Inner parts of my body and knIt me 
together In my mother's womb Thank You for makIng me so 
wonderfully complexl Your workmanshIp IS marvelous---how wellI 
know It You watched me as I was belng formed In utter seclusIon, asI 
was woven together In the dark ofthe womb You saw me BEFOREI 
WAS BORN 
God also says in the Bible that any intentional taking of any life is 
murder, whether In the womb or outsIde the womb! 
Proverbs chapter 6 verses 16-19 says, “There are seven things which the 
Lord hates One of the seven things God hates is ”hands\ that shed
I
I
I 
innocent blood.” Intentionally taking the life of an innocent baby while 
still in the womb is an example of shedding innocent blood 
Personally, I strongly believe that any person that doesn't vote 
WILL face the judgment of God for their part in taking even one 
baby's life, let alone many babies’ lives Like myself, every person on 
this committee Wlll give an account to God for the things he or she 
does Second Corinthians chapter 5 verses 10 and 11 tells us, ”For we 
MUST all stand before Christ to BE JUDGED We will each receive 
WHATEVER we deserve, for the good or evil we have done in this 
earthly body." I understand my responsibility to the Lord; therefore, I 
am working hard to persuade this committee. As God's Ambassador to 
you today, I'm ”working hard to persuade you" to vote for 
two reasons To save the lives of innocent babies AND to warn you 
about this judgment on you for your part in the murder of babies’ lives 
IF you vote against this billl 
I rge each one of you to PLEASE PRAY for wisdom and to vote 
on LD 1249...PASS THE BlLL...PROTECT THE BABIES! 
Thank You for your time, God Bless you all
