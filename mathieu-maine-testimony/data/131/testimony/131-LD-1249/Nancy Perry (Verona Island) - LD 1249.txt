LD 1249
I'm writing to support LD 1249 - to protect quality of care by prohibiting physicians 
from prescribing abortion-inducing drugs or devices via Telehealth or Electronic 
communication.  Abortion is murder of innocent victims.  There is no kind or nice 
way to say that.  Drugs or devices that induce abortion have no place in our state - 
regardless of the medium through which they are prescribed.  Laws that support 
murder are not lawful, yet they've been allowed, yes, even welcomed by many, in the 
name of "choice" and protecting the mother.  Who speaks for the unborn child?  Who 
protects the child's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?  Please consider 
this before adding yet another layer of "legal' violence towards the unborn.  Thank 
you.
