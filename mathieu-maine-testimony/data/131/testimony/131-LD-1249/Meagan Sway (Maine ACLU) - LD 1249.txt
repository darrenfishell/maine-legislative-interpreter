AMERICAN Blllll. LIBERTIIES UNIIIN 
Maine 
TESTIMONY OF MEAGAN SWAY, ESQ 
Ought Not To Pass 
LD 1249 — An Act to Protect the Quality of Care provided via Telehealth by 
Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or 
Devices Through Telehealth or Other Electronic Communication 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
May 5, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, greetings My name is Meagan Sway, and I am 
policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U S Constitutions On behalf of our members, I am here to testify 
against LD 1249 
If enacted, this bill would (1) prohibit medical providers from prescribing 
medication abortion for their patients by telehealth, telephone, or other digital 
communications, (2) prohibit anyone from sending another person abortion 
medication, (3) create a felony, Class C crime for anyone who violates the first or 
second provisions, and (4) S11l) _]6Ct people who violate the first or second provisions to 
lawsuits for wrongful death or medical malpractice 
This bill directly contradicts the Maine Reproductive Privacy Act, which provides 
that “[i]t is the public policy of the State that the State not restrict a Woman’s 
exercise of her private decision to terminate a pregnancy before viability ” 22 
M R S §1598(1) 
Telehealth medicine is governed by Title 32, Chapter 48, Subchapter 4 The law 
states that a person licensed “may provide telehealth S8I'V1C6S as long as the 
licensee acts within the scope of practice of the licensee ’s license, in accordance with 
any requirements and restrictions imposed by this subchapter and in accordance 
with the standards of practice ” 32 M R S §3300-BB Exempting abortion from this 
law of general applicability does not make sense, and only serves to stigmatize 
abortion and push this fundamental right out of reach of pregnant people Creating 
new felonies likewise 1S unnecessary and stigmatizing Additionally, by targeting 
telemedicine specifically, this bill would harm people living in the most rural parts 
of the state, for whom health care access—including abortion access—is more 
difficult
Abortlon 1s a fundamental r1ght The ab111ty to dec1de whether and when to havea 
ch1ld 1s one of the most lmportant a person has, affectlng thelr educatlon, health 
and career prospects The 1eg1s1ature should do everythlng 1t can to ensure that 
pregnant people across the state, no matter where they are, can access th1s 
essentlal health care when they need 1t We urge you to vote ought not to pass
