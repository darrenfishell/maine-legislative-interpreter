LD 1249
It is my hope the 131st Legislative for the great State of Maine voice a “yes vote” for 
the passage of LD 1249. My purely personal reason that I am providing written 
testimony for LD 1249 is because I cherish maintaining life and a God gifted soul at 
all stages of human being existence from conception with unique DNA through 
fertilization to fetus development for a special Lord God’s mission in life in the 
womb. Biblical Scripture in Luke 1;31-32 (NAB version) says: “Behold, you will 
conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.  He will be 
great and will be called son of the Most High…”
The State governments like Texas and Wisconsin are using the six weeks fetus 
heartbeat law. However, six weeks is much too long for a fetus heartbeat legislation in
any State of the United States (USA).  Also, any person that states life does not 
initiate at conception is lying to force their unjust and ungodly paid political agenda. 
Maine needs to use 18-21 days or earlier for their fetus heartbeat law to prohibit 
abortions. 
 Any individual person should not be forced, against their will, to undergo an abortion
by any means. God provides us a free will and it is common sense that all aborted 
babies’ living souls and spirits go straight to heaven.  Let us hope all Legislators have 
a belief in a living God and they do not choose to play God’s role themselves with 
Maine Laws.    
Videos providing actual flicker sounds of fetus heartbeats 5-6 weeks of pregnancy are

Human life starts at conception. Unfortunately, most people desire some reliable 
measurement and visible proof of human life in order to voice that it has legal 
significance.  Half of all Americans believe an unborn child in the womb should not 
be aborted once a heartbeat is detected.  Article found in the September 2, 2021 issue 
of USA TODAY states this fact:

In fact, the Holy Bible provides God’s view that the unborn child in the womb shows 
life the very minute blood is flowing through a detected heartbeat.  Leviticus 17:11 
says: “Since the life of a living body is in its blood ….” (NAB version).
When can you hear the fetus heartbeat for the first time? The unborn child’s heart 
starts to beat as early as the 18-21 days of pregnancy. This is when the first sign of a 
developing embryo called a fetal pole is visible.
