Dear Committee Members:
A pregnant woman needs to be seen in person.  Many problems can arise and not even
be diagnosed except by a physician.  The physician also need to verify that the person 
IS pregnant.  Telehealth should NOT be used for pregnancy diagnosis or abortion.
I ask that you vote OUGHT to PASS on this bill.
