Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen, and Members of the Judrcrary Comnfnttee, l 
am Rey Dubo1s, from Bangor, and I am speakmg 1n favor of LDs 494, 771, 1197, 1249, 
and 1614 
I base my presentatlon on what 1s FAIR and what 1s MORAL 
The Hyde Amendment lnn1ts Medrcard re1mbursement for some abortron costs, and 1t 1s 
entlrely farr that the Hyde Amendment be enforced 1n Mame, lrke 1t 1s m most other 
states Tax payers should not be forced to pay for the electrve procedures that are 
abo1t1on, when they profoundly drsagree w1th abortlon, the krllmg of a pre-born chrld 
Our elderly , mtellectually d1sabled, and homeless people need those tax dollars more 
than the 98% of women who become pregnant through the1r own behavlors We 
taxpayers should not have to pay for the consequence of a man and a woman's 
consensual act that results m an unplanned pregnancy It's trme for them to pay for the 
result of then own dec1s1ons 
An Act to Protect a Woman's Rrght to Wrthdraw Consent for an Abortlon makes so much 
sense, that I'm even surpnsed to see that thrs legrslatron must be requlred as a law Don‘t 
we all agree that "NO" means "N01" Shouldn't you be allowed to change your mrnd, 
save a baby's hfe, and have your dec1s1on respected Pass LD 771 wrthout any hagglmg 
It makes so much sense 
LD 1197 1s s1m1larly so stralght forward that 1t should pass w1thoutres1stance It 1s _]l1SlZ 
so FAIR that a woman should not be coerced mto krlhng her chrld Aren't people always 
grven appropnate mformatron/educatron re electwe procedures 
LD 1249 restnct a Physrcran from prescnbmg abortron through telehealth Wouldn't you 
thrnk that an etlncal medrcal practruoner would want to do an actual face to face 
physrcal exam of a pregnant lady before domg somethmg so drastrc as l<1ll her chlld To 
abort a baby wrthout knowmg the correct fetal age, placenta locatron, or potentral 
presence of ectoprc pregnancy seem tantamount to malpractrce Isn't the health and 
safety of the mother supposed to be so lmportant? LD 1249 certamly protects the health 
and safety of the mother more than ANY of the b1lls dlscussed 1n hearmgs on Monday 
LD 1614 requrres that an ultrasound be completed and counselmg be provrded 
Approprrate dragnostrcs and full d1scuss1on of safety and optrons seems hke somethmg a 
respectable practrtroner would provlde 
All of us testrfymg today are gomg to tell you these brlls ought to pass, and I recommend 
that you vote "Ought to pass" , but not _]llS'£ because they mrght result n1 fewer babres 
bemg krlled Pass these b1lls because they'll result m the mothers bemg treated more 
safely and professronally, and the medlcal provrders W111 practrce then trade 1n a more 
professronal manner
