To: The Judiciary Committee 
 
I am writing to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD1249 for these reasons: 
1. Nearly half of all abortions in the United States today are chemical 
abortions. 
2. Regulations and safety measures are being rolled back in too many states 
ignoring the protection of the woman seeking an abortion. 
3. Chemical abortions increase the likelihood that no one will be held liable if 
something goes wrong.  
4. It is too risky for a woman to be able to have such a serious medical thing 
done to her without seeing a qualified doctor. 
5. Abortion related complications are four times more likely during a chemical 
abortion than a surgical procedure.  
 
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD1249!
