Senator
Anne
Carney ,
Representative
Matt
Moonen,
and
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
My
name
is
Cait
V aughan
and
I
am
a
staf f
member
with
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!),
an
education
and
advocacy
or ganization
dedicated
to
advancing
reproductive
health,
rights
and
justice
for
present
and
future
generations.
I’m
testifying
on
behalf
of
GRR!
in
opposition
to
LD
1249:
An
Act
to
Pr otect
the
Quality
of
Car e
Pr ovided

T elehealth

T elehealth
or
Other
Electr onic
Communication.
Medication
Abortions
provided
through
telehealth
consultation
and
mail
delivery
of
medication
have
been
happening
in
Maine
for
many
years,
innovated
initially
by
Maine
Family
Planning
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
state’ s
lar gely
rural
population.
This
service
delivery
method
has
improved
access
for
rural
Mainers
and
others
who
cannot
travel
or
take
on
the
additional
costs
of
missing
work
and
finding
childcare.
This
option
also
of fers
privacy
for
those
not
wishing
to
move
through
protestors
to
access
care
or
risk
exposure
being
seen
going
into
a
clinic
in
small
towns.
T elehealth
access
is
a
matter
of
equity
for
all
Mainers,
and
there
is
no
medical
or
legal
reason
for
singling
out
abortion
care
provided
via
telehealth
over
any
other
service.
The
results
of
a
2020
study ,
published
in
the
Journal
of
the
American
Medical
Association,
showed
the
ef ficacy
of
fully
remote
medication
abortions
via
telehealth
to
be
the
same
as
in-person
medication
dispensing,
which
is
95%
ef ficacy
1
.
Protocols
for
telemedicine
abortion
care
have
been
collaboratively
developed
by
expert
providers
and
researchers,
and
it
is
proven
to
be
a
safe
and
ef fective
method
for
pregnancy
termination
2
.
Underlying
LD
1249
is
the
insulting
notion
that
pregnant
people
cannot
be
trusted
to
swallow
pills
unless
under
the
physical
supervision
of
a
medical
provider .
It
also
promotes
the
disproven
myth
that
abortion
pills–typically
a
combination
of
mifepristone
and
misoprostol–are
dangerous
medications.
This
is
untrue,
and
millions
of
pregnant
people
across
the
country
have
proven
their
safety
in
the
more
than
two
decades
since
the
FDA
approved
mifepristone
for
this
purpose.
W e
trust
abortion
providers–who
are
experts
in
this
care–to
deliver
it
safely ,
and
we
trust
pregnant
people
to
know
what
is
best
for
their
own
health
and
families.
GRR!s
want
pregnant
Mainers
to
feel
supported
and
safe,
and
LD
1249
moves
us
in
the
wrong
direction.
W e
ur ge
the
committee
to
vote
against
LD
1249.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration,
