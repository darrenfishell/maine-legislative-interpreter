John Mills

LD 1249
     Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary 
Committee.
     My name is John Mills and I live in Holden.
     This testimony is in support of LD 1249 - An Act to Protect the Quality of Care 
Provided via Telehealth by Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing 
Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through Telehealth or Other Electronic 
Communication.
     The rapid increase in the number of chemically-induced abortions in our nation is 
of great concern to me.  Almost half of all abortions today are now chemical 
abortions.  This is resulting in more unborn children being killed which I am opposed 
to.
     The chemical abortion movement increases the ease of access to abortion within 
our nation without much accountability.  No doctor is present in person before or after
the abortion to provide advice and to be available to help when complications arise.  
The women is likely to be alone when complications arise.
    Data reveals that abortion related complications are four times more likely during a 
chemical abortion than during a surgical abortion.  20 percent of pregnant women will
experience some complications during the chemical abortion.  We should be 
concerned with the health and safety of these women.
     Another concern is that the lack of accountability for prescribers creates the 
opportunity for potential abusers to obtain the medication and use it to cause an 
abortion without the knowledge or consent of the pregnant mother.
     Please inform yourself about these concerns.  
     I urge each member of the Committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1249.
     Thank you.
