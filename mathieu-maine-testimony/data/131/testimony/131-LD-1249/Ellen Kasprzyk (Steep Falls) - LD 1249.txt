Prescription drugs are presription drugs because of the negative potential impact they 
may have.  Prescribing drugs over the telephone or other "non-personal" situation 
opens the door for a great deal of distribution of potentially dangerous substances 
without proper oversight or controls.  
An abortion situation is frequently not a standard doctor/patient scenario.  Many times
the doctor (if they actually are a doctor) has no prior knowledge and very limited 
information about the patient they are attending to making prescribing these drugs all 
the more dangerous.  
Please support LD 1249 and prevent potentially dangerous drugs from spreading 
across our State.
