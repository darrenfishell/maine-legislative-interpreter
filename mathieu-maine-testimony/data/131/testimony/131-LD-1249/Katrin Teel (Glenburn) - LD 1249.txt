Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on Judiciary, I 
am Katrin Teel of Glenburn, Maine. I am here to testify in support of L.D. 1249. An Act to 
Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing 
Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through Telehealth or Other Electronic Communication. 
The chemical abortion movement in America is not without dangers. This bill will help protect 
women from the risk of abortion-related complications associated with a chemical abortion. It 
will also require increased accountability from prescribers, and help close the door to fraud and 
abuse of women. 
In short, this bill will save lives. Not only the lives of the unborn but also the women who are 
carrying them.  
Toward that end, I encourage you to vote yes on L.D. 1249. Thank you for allowing me to 
contribute my testimony.
