LD1249 
An act to protect the quality of care provided via telehealth 
by prohibi Ɵng physicians from prescribing aborƟon-inducing drugs or devices 
through telehealth or other electronic communic aƟon. 
 
I am wriƟng today in support of LD1249.  A person in sup port of abor Ɵon could easily support this bill as 
well.  It is unwise to reduce a life changing decision as severe and consequencial as an abor Ɵon to a cell 
phone app.  The a borƟon-inducing drug is not something to take lightly, it’s not a ‘take two aspirin and 
call me in the morning’ situaƟon.  Telehe alth has its place, this is not it.  An abor Ɵon is a diﬃcult Ɵme in 
a woman’s life.  To go thru one at home alone with no medical support is distressing and precarious.  
This bill would help ensure an abor Ɵon is handled a ƩenƟvely with prudence. 
   
Thank you for your serv ice and aƩenƟon.  Please vote yes on LD1249.
