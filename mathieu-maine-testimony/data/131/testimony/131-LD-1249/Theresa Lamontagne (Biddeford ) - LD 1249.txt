Drug induced abortions, are very complicated. It sounds fairly easy to some people. 
Take a pill and you’re all set. That is far from the way these drugs work. It’s bad 
enough to be given the drugs and go home and end up having your child delivered in 
the toilet. This is not make-believe I’m talking about. Many women have experienced 
this. The shock is overwhelming. No one prepared her for this site. Now Planned 
Parenthood wants to give these drugs without even being seen by a physician?  No 
follow up, no concern for the health and well being of the mother.  This is not health 
care!
