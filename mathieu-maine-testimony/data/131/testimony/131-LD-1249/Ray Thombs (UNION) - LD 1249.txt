Respected Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, Senator 
Carney and Representative Mo onen, my name is Ray Thombs, and I am from 
Union, Maine. I am writing to express my strong support for LD 1249 and the four other proposed bills that are under consideration at this hearing. As a 
father who has personally experienced the loss of two of my four children -  
one in the womb and the other at the age of 30, my family and I have developed a deep empathy for those facing similar challenges. We have 
spent infinite  amounts  of time in hospitals such as Johns Hopkins, Boston 
Children's, and Maine M edical Center's Barbara Bush wing.  
 
In addition to shepherding my family through these difficult seasons of life, I 
have also guided hundreds  of people through various challenges and 
celebrations, including deaths, marriages, adoptions, anniversaries, and 
tragedies. Today, I speak not only for myself but also for at least 400,000 
Mainers who believe  similarly . We believe  that all human beings have the 
right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As a member of the human family, the unborn human being  deserves the same protection under the law 
as any other individual. I am here to advocate for the protection and preservation of these endangered human lives and to ensure that their value 
is respected and upheld by all members of society,  just as much as the 
reproductive health and well- being of the mother.  
 
The proposed bills LD1249, 1197, 1614, 494, and 771 intend to establish 
appropriate  governance standards  that result  in providing  excellence  of care . 
Furthermore, these bills will guarantee proper accountability, ensuring the protection of both reproductive  health and the lives of unborn infants. I 
strongly urge this committee to recommend the passage of these bills to the Legislative Body as "ought to pass."  
 
Life for All Ray Thombs
