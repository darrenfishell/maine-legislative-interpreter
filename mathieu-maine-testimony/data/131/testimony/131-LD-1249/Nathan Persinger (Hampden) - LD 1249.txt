LD 1249
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1249 and protect women from the dangers of 
gaining abortion-inducing drugs and devices through the mail or Telehealth. This 
method of obtaining these drugs and devices puts women at risk and removes the 
accountability of the provider of these drugs and devices. It makes it far too easy to 
receive drugs and devices that end the life of a child and can cause irreparable harm to
the mother. It also bypasses in-person appointments in which a provider is more likely
to detect instances of abuse and/or coerced abortion.
Please pass LD 1249.
