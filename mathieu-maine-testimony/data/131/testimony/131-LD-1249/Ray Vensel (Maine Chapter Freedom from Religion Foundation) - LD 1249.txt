Re: LD 1249 An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by Prohibiting 
Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through Telehealth or Other 
Electronic Communication   
 
Members of the Committee on Judiciary, this is testimony AGAINST LD 1249.  
Telehealth Services have been available for many years now, since before the beginning of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Not only were these services critical during a public health emergency, 
but they also served communities with very few other options: the more rural areas of Maine.  
LD 1249 seems based upon political positions and not on public health facts, and its provisions 
don’t seem to treat any specific gap in the quality of medical care. It seems targeted only toward 
restricting access to a legal procedure and prevents patients from accessing a safe method of 
reproductive health care.  
Please vote “Ought Not To Pass” on LD 1249, and preserve reproductive health rights. Thank 
you.  
Sincerely, 
-Ray Vensel
