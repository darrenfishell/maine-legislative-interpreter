LD 1249
I am writing in support of LD 1249. Chemical abortion can be far more dangerous 
than surgical abortion, which is at least done in the presence of medical staff and 
others. Chemical abortion has no supervision. It is bad enough that surgical abortion 
is generally done by a doctor with very little knowledge of the patient. But 
telemedicine is wholly unsuitable for this procedure.
