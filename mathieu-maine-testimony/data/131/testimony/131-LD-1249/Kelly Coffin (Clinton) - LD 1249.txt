Please support LD1249. My name is Kelly Coffin from Clinton.If a woman uses 
drugs/devices for pregnancy she must be seen to ensure she does not have ectopic 
pregnancy creating high risk for hemorrhage or be too advanced in gestation also 
causing GREAT risk for the same. In person supervision for ultimate safety is a must. 
This also may put some Pharmacists jobs in jeopardy if they personally object to 
dispensing and becoming part of the abortion chain. Also an unintended public health 
risk/negative environmental impact because human remains are going down toilets as 
well as these abortion drugs and we have been told NEVER flush medications as they 
are PROVEN to end up in the water. Glad I have a well. Think about that the next 
time you take a drink as 50% of abortions are performed by this method.  How will 
this be monitored at public water facilities? Thank you.
