"An
Act
to
Address
Income
Disparity
in
Health
Care
by
Limiting
the
Compensation
of
Hospital
Executives"
April

2023
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyers
and
members
of
the
Committee
,
my
name
is
Sadie
Tirrell
and
I’m
a
registered
nurse
and
a
member
of
the
Maine
State
Nurses
Association.
I
work
in
the
float
pool
at
Maine
Medical
Center
where
we
are
proud
to
have
won
our
first
union
contract.
So
far
in
2023,
I
have
received
multiple
emails
from
MaineHealth
executives
letting
me
know
that
as
an
organization
we
are
in
financial
distress,
the
most
recent
citing
a
larger
number
of
“contracted
employees”
as
the
reason
why.
This
is
upsetting
because
it
calls
not
only
my
job,
but
the
safety
of
our
entire
community
into
question.
It
feels
like
the
intention
is
to
make
nurses
feel
guilty
for
advocating
for
a
reasonable
wage
and
to
stop
us
from
continuing
that
work
for
fear
of
putting
our
jobs
and
community
into
jeopardy.
Under
the
union
contract
and
improved
wage
scale
I
make
$35
an
hour
caring
often
for
5
patients
at
a
time,
handling
simultaneous
emergencies
with
regularity.
At
the
end
of
a
rough
day
I
think
about
what
my
take
home
pay
was
that
day.
Would
I
have
agreed
to
do
what
I
did
that
day
for
$275?
Definitely
not.
The
physical
and
emotional
stress
of
that
type
of
13
hour
day
is
NOT
worth
that
amount
of
money.
Unsafe
staffing
ratios
and
poor
compensation,
for
all
care
team
members,
is
the
reason
that
nurses
are
leaving
the
profession
in
droves.
Getting
this
sort
of
messaging
about
how
my
salary
being
too
high
is
the
reason
for
the
organization’ s
financial
distress
is
so
insulting
when
I
come
to
work
and
engage
with
a
morally
injurious
system
and
work
as
hard
as
I
possibly
can,
because
there
is
no
other
option
when
patient
safety
is
on
the
line.
When
I
start
to
feel
guilt
and
internalize
MMCs
message,
I
remind
myself
of
the
hospital
executives
salaries
and
I
know
that
I
am
right
to
demand
just
enough
money
to
survive
in
return
for
the
beautiful
work
I
do.
I
know
that
I
am
right
to
want
even
more.
I
want
safe
staffing
ratios,
I
want
fair
compensation,
and
I
want
hospital
executives
to
be
prevented
from
making
more
than
"5
times
the
median
compensation
of
the
full-time
registered
professional
nurses"
that
work
in
the
hospital.
The
hospital
executives
have
made
it
clear
that
cuts
need
to
be
made
somewhere
to
keep
our
healthcare
community
afloat.
I
think
regulating
their
ballooning
salaries
an
appropriate
measure
to
take
to
ensure
they
don’t
keep
taking
30%
increases
to
already
massive
salaries
during
“times
of
financial
distress.”
I
am
here
to
say
that
nurses
need
help
making
the
beside
a
sustaininble
career
and
we
need
help
amplifying
our
say
in
the
direction
of
hospital
industry.
This
bill
is
specifically
what
we
need
and
what
we
are
asking
for.
The
quality
of
Maine
healthcare
impacts
us
all.
Protecting
it
is
a
responsibility
we
all
share.
Please
pass
LD
1321
to
help
us
regulate
the
hospital
industry
to
create
a
safe
environnment
for
patients
in
Maine
and
the
staff
that
provide
their
care.
Thank
you.
