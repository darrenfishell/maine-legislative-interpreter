Mike Tipping THE MAINE SENATE 3 State House Station 
Senator, District 8 13 lst Legislature Augusta, Maine 04333 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and distinguished members of the Committee on Health 
and Human Services: 
My name is Mike Tipping. I represent Senate District 8 in northern Penobscot County and I'm proud 
to present LD 1321, An Act to Address Income Disparity in Health Care by Limiting the 
Compensation of Hospital Executives. It's written to limit hospital executive salaries to ﬁve times 
what an average RN at that hospital is paid. 
A few years ago, when my wife was working as an occupational therapist on the cardiac floor of 
Maine Medical Center in Portland, they were facing some tough financial times. The hospital cuta 
paid vacation day for every health care worker. They also cancelled their annual staff appreciation 
ice cream sundae. Later that year, the CEO received around a $200,000 bonus on top of their $2 
million salary. 
The outsized compensation of hospital executives is a national problem, and it's getting worse. 
From 2005 to 2015, the average compensation of major nonprofit hospital CEOs rose by 93% while 
average hospital worker wages increased by only 8%.1 
Things have become even more extreme in Maine, with some of the greatest pay disparities 
between executives and staff of hospitals anywhere in the country? 
In 2021, the CEO of Northern Light made $1.2 million per year. For MaineHealth, CEO compensation 
is over $2 million with salary and bonuses and other executives make more than $500,000 a year. 
$2 million a year is about $1,000 an hour. They make the equivalent of the annual income of the 
median Mainer in less than a week. 
That's an incredibly high pay rate, even for very large non~proﬁts. In 2021, the average 
compensation for a CEO of a non-proﬁt in Maine with a budget of more than $10 million was 
$178,443. The highest paid state government agency director was $248,370. The Chancellor of the 
University of Maine System made $350,000. The president of the University of Maine made 
$3 71,000. 
Outsized hospital executive salaries aren't just due to the size and complexity of the organizations, 
or even a result of in-sector competition. A review of hospitals of similar sizes in the same locations 
found CEO pay differences of 200-400% between twin hospitals. 
These astronomical, outlier rates of compensation we've seen in Maine divert limited resources 
away from vital care. I don't need to tell this committee about the health care needs in our state and

how this kind of money could be better spent, but I will note that Maine's two largest hospitals 
spent similar amounts on total executive compensation as they did on total charity care last year.3 
These outsized levels of compensation also put executives into a very different socio-economic 
atmosphere from the employees they're managing and incentivize treating hospitals more like for- 
profit corporations, potentially maximizing private insurance patients and deprioritizing care in 
rural areas among many other decisions that may not be made in the public interest. 
As drafted, this bill would limit hospital executive salaries to five times the median compensation of 
registered professional nurses that they employ. RN s are the most numerously employed health 
care professionals in hospitals and this metric was meant to allow for regional and institutional 
variability and incentivize increasing health care worker compensation. There are other ways this 
same goal could be accomplished. For one example, a current ballot measure in California seeks to 
cap hospital CEO pay at the salary of the U.S. President — currently $45 0,000 a year. 
I'd also understand if the committee would prefer to phase-in this requirement to allow for the 
expiration of current contracts, or would prefer additional language to clarify the implementation 
and enforcement of the intent of this legislation. 
Even with this bill, hospital CEOs would be far and away the highest-paid non~proﬁt executives in 
our state, but l think it's important to begin to at least limit these excesses. As this committee and 
past legislatures have determined many times, our non-proﬁt hospitals are a public trust. They 
represent an extraordinary outlay of state resources and they have always been subject to public 
oversight. We should honor that trust and rein in this extreme overcompensation. 
Thank you for your consideration and I'm happy to take any questions.
