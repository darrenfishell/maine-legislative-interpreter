I am writing to add my strong support for LD1321. The dramatic increase in hospital 
executive salaries and bonuses over the years is both shocking and disgraceful. 
Hospitals such as Maine Health and Northern Light are nonprofit in name only. In a 
time when healthcare costs continue to bankrupt Maine families, and when nurses and
other hospital staff face cuts in staffing to dangerous levels and have to fight for fair 
wages, it is unconscionable that healthcare executives are paid so handsomely. I 
believe that Senator Tippingâ€™s testimony gives you all of the information you need to 
enact the legislation he proposes.
