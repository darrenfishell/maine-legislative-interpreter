Re:  Support of LD 1107
Dear Valuable Representatives of the People of Maine:
I am writing as a person with a small investment in rental property in support of 
LD 1107.   I am a small landlord in Central Maine.  Positive turnover (tenants 
moving on a consistent basis) is very important to my business plan to keep my 
properties refreshed and safe.  One of our distinct missions as owners is to educate 
tenants on how to be a good tenant while they reside in our units but also, how to 
work toward being homeowners themselves.  
One of the benefits of “small” landlords like us is that we are invested in the 
communities that we own property in.  My goal is to provide safe, quality housing 
with excellent tenant/owner communication.  I want to have my current tenants 
become my future neighbors.  
LD 1107 would assist landlords like us in helping tenants to become homeowners 
by exploring the options of reporting on time rental payments to boost their credit 
scores.  Although there are currently ways to do so, I currently do not do this 
because of the risk factor of dealing with sensitive personal information.  To allow 
an agency like Maine Housing to begin this process could open doors for many 
people almost immediately.
Please vote in FAVOR of LD 1107 as it is written. Thank you for your 
consideration.
Donna E. Hodges
