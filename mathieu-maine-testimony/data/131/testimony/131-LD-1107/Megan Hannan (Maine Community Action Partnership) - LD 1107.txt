207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 1107: Resolve, 
to Establish a Pilot Project to lm prove Access to Credit for 
Low-income Individuals 
March 28, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, members of the Committee on 
Labor and Housing, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the 
Maine Community Action Partnership and we support LD 1107,a 
Resolve, to Establish a Pilot Project to Improve Access to Credit for 
Low-income Individuals. 
Living on the edge of poverty, or even with a low-income, is a full time 
and difficult job. Individuals and families remain under resourced by 
design, our supposed safety nets come with so many holes and the 
system is designed to make it hard to pull your way out. 
One such system is the credit score. I understand that banks and 
businesses need to know when they are lending money, they are 
making a good choice, I am not saying that having a credit score 
system itself is the problem. But it does leave out a large number of 
families, many of whom pay their bills on time, all the time, as difficult as 
that may be. For most of these families, their rent consumes the largest 
portion of their income, but it does not always have a positive effect on 
credit scores, while when rent isn’t paid it will negatively affect those 
scores if a landlord acts. 
A good credit score is hard to build and easy to damage. Adding more 
positives into the mix will help individuals and families to reach a better 
credit score, meaning the potential ability to move from renting their 
home to buying one, or even renting a larger unit or in a nicer area, 
which in turn can lead to other positive changes. Better school districts, 
better food choices, more access to green space and health care — all 
the things we know are key in determining long term health and 
wellness. 
This is really a modest proposal that has the potential to show great 
promise. I hope we can add one more tool to the few we have to 
change lives for the better. 
Thank you for your time and attention, I am happy to answer your 
questions ifl can.
