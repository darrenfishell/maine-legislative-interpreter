Re: LD I107 Resolved to Establish Pilot Project to Improve Access to Credit for Low 
Income Individuals 
I am submitting this testimony in support of the bill. 
Having tenants use payment of rent to build their credit histories is in the interest of both 
the tenants and landlords. This will hopefully give tenants an incentive to pay their rent ina 
timely manner. It would also help tenants who pay their rent in a timely manner to develop 
stronger credit histories. 
Many small landlords lack the sophistication to deal with the fair credit reporting act, so 
to really achieve this we need entities like Maine State Housing or others too kind of take on 
the technical aspects of it and keep it fairly simple for smaller and less sophisticated landlords 
to do this and this is where a pilot project will be very helpful in devising a simplistic system to 
get that information reported. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
' 
Very truly yours, 
D'
