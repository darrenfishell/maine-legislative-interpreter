On Behalf of the Maine Real Estate Managers 
Association  
 
In support of  LD 1 107 Resolve, to Establish a Pilot 
project to Improve Access to Credit for Low -income 
Individuals  
 
March 27, 2023  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the  Labor and 
Housing Committee , my name is  Sherrin Vail , and I am writing to you as a 
member of the  Maine Real Estate Managers Association  (MREMA) .   
 
Our organization is a nonprofit which represents over 80 professional property 
manage ment companies providing  affordable and subsidized housing 
throughout the state.  It is within our mission to promote the availability of 
safe, decent affordable housing in Maine.  Our man agement members  are 
both for -profit and nonprofit  landlords  that believe in this mission.  
 
As property managers, we have applicant screening in place with credit history 
a part of the selection criteria.  Our only means to know if an applicant has a 
positi ve rental history  payment  is to contact prior landlords, who may or may 
not call us back.  Our members support a more systematic way to identify 
applicant’s positive rent payment history.  
 
Our members also focus on providing our residents with an improved quality 
of life through resident service programs.  These programs connect residents 
with services in the community to help their financial, health and overall 
wellbeing.   Part of our resident ’s wellbeing and access to opportunity  is the 
ability to establi sh positive credit history with rent reporting.  Some of our 
residents have credit they need to repair or credit they need to establish to 
buy a vehicle, get student loans for themselves or their children, or buy a 
house.  Rent reporting is a pathway towards those opportunities.  This is a 
terrific opportunity for residents while also providing a landlord benefit by 
incentivizing on -time monthly rent paymen ts. 
 
Because this pilot program doesn’t charge a fee to residents or landlords, it is 
accessible to all.  
 
For all the reasons noted above, MREMA supports the passage of LD 1107.
