Re:  LD 11 07, Resolve, to Establish a Pilot Project to Improve Access to Credit for Low -income 
Individuals  - Rep. Sam Zager of Portland  
 
Honorable Chairs and Committee Members:  
 
Please  accept this brief written testimon y in support  of the Resolve proposed by Represent ative Zager . No 
doubt today the Committee  will hear a multitude of reasons why a pilot project as conte mplate d in the 
Resolve can benefit Maine tenants and landlords . 
 
Improving f inancial capability  of Maine people  is not officially a function  of the Office of the S tate 
Treasurer , but we see t he issues related to LD 1 107 as especially important  to the Stateâ€™s overall fiscal 
health. Rep. Zager engage d our office early for potential support and input. We have been happy to serve 
that role in early conversations about this effort with t he Credit Builders A llianc e, financial inst itutions 
and vendors. We wish to continue to be of assistance to the Committee, Rep. Zager and other interested 
parties as  LD 1 107 proceeds.  
  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
Henry Beck  
State Treasurer
