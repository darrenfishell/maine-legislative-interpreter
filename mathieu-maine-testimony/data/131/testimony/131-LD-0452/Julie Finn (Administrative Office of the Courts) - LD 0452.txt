Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 452, An Act to Reform 
the Laws Regarding the Payment of Criminal Fines: 
Senator Camey, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony regarding this bill. 
The Judicial Branch does not take a position on the policy considerations raised by this 
bill but would like to make a couple of comments. 
It is difﬁcult to assess how many cases would be affected by this change which makes it 
difﬁcult to estimate the ﬁscal impact. As you know, ﬁne revenues go to the General Fund and 
there would likely be some reduction in amounts collected. It may not be possible to quantify the 
amount for the Office of Fiscal and Program Review (OFPR). 
Finally, it seems that LD 452 would apply to mandatory ﬁnes and mandatory minimum 
ﬁnes. If the intent is to give a judge authority to reduce or terminate a mandatory ﬁne, it seems to 
create a conﬂict with statutory language making the ﬁne mandatory. 
Thank you for your time.
