Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and honorable members of the 
Transportation Committee, 
 
My name is Jan Collins, I am assistant director of Maine Prisoner Advocacy 
Coalition. MPAC ’s purpose is to reduce Maine ’s use of incarceration by 
advocating for a criminal legal system that is ethical, humane and restorative. 
 
I am here in support of LD 777 An Act to Align the Minimum Rate of Pay for 
Manufacturers of Maine License Plates at the Maine State Prison with Maine's 
Minimum Wage Laws. 
 
It is the mission of the Maine Department of Corrections to rehabilitate and prepare 
its residents to return to their communities as productive and contributing 
members. 
 
Too often time served in Maine’s prisons means residents have lost their home, 
their car, and their source of employment leaving them penniless and with no 
means of support for themselves or their families. They may also be burdened by 
debt including restitution and childcare payments. These are not ingredients for 
successful reentry. 
 
The Maine Department of Corrections requires employers hiring inmates in work 
release programs to pay them the legal minimum wage. Under work release(see 
policy 27.3 Community Transition Program ) “resident shall relinquish to the Chief 
Administrative Officer, or designee, all earnings received by the resident with the 
understanding that required obligations will be deducted in accordance with the 
collection priority list (Attachment A to Policy 2.12, Resident Accounts ).” These 
required obligations include restitution payments, etc. The remainder of the non-
obligated funds can be saved to support the individual upon release or be sent to 
families for their support.  

 
  
In short, there are many benefits to providing reasonable remuneration for license 
plate manufacturing jobs. It benefits victims, individuals, families and their 
communities. 
 
If we expect members of the community to pay work release workers a minimum 
wage, as a state, we should do the same. Our economy and our communities will 
both benefit. 
 
I urge you to support LD 777. 
 
Thank-you,
