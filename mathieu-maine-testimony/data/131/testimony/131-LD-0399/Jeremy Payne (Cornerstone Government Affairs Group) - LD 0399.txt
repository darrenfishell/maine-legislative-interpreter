Re: Testimony neither for nor against LD 399, “An Act To Amend the Portfolio 
Requirements for Class II Resources ” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee: 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Cornerstone Government Affairs Group 
here to testify neither for nor against LD 399 on behalf of our client the Maine Renewable 
Energy Association (“MREA”). 
We understand the goal of the sponsor’s amendment is establish an Alternative Compliance 
Payment (“ACP”) rate, which effectively operates as a price cap, for the so-called “Class II” 
market. Similar to any commodity market there is some price ﬂuctuation; however, historically, 
the Class II market price has been relatively low and stable. And that stability has again returned 
as we understand prices have come down to approximately $10/REC. MREA supports directing 
the Public Utilities Commission (“PUC”) to establish in rule an ACP of no less than $10 and no 
more than $20. This pricing certainty helps protect the compliant resources ’ operational viability 
and also ensuring they will continue to be around to help meet our policy goals 
Just last month Govemor Mills announced in her budget address that she is accelerating her 
commitment to move Maine to l00% renewable energy by 2040 — the Class II market plays an 
important role — in fact, 30% — in conﬁrming we can cost effectively achieve our goals. 
We believe directing the PUC to set the ACP with the appropriate pricing parameters sendsa 
clear signal these assets are valued and valuable to our clean energy future while also building in 
consumer protections. Notably, today’s ACP for the Class IA and I is $50, and the thermal 
RPS’s ACP is $25. Each class has an important role to play and we appreciate the sponsor’s 
attempt to seek pricing certainty and faimess going forward. 
Thankyou.
