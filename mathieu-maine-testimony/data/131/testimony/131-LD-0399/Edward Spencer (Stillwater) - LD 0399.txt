LDs 399 and 437 Opposition Testimony
Dear Senate Chair Lawrence and House Chair Zeigler, and Members of the Energy, Utilities, and 
Technology Committee,
We at Don’t Waste Maine appreciate the opportunity to testify in opposition to LD 399 and LD 437. Our 
associates feel that offering Renewable Energy Credits to Waste to Energy plants is contrary to the 
beneficial practice of subsidizing clean and renewable energy sources in Maine.
We applaud all efforts to reduce waste outputs, and certainly ecoMaine is the Maine leader in 
responsible waste management. The bottom line is still that burning plastic wastes introduces harmful 
and dangerous pollutants into our air. Waste volume reduction is important, but that is offset by the 
increased toxicity of the residuals. After looking at the list of other REC recipients, there appears to be 
no precedence for this program approving an application that results in high levels of toxic byproducts 
from the energy produced. 
RECs are better suited to clean energy solutions such as properly sited windmills and solar power 
installations that do not remove productive cropland or otherwise important habitat in the quest for 
renewable energy.
We are not opposed to other state subsidies or assistance that help Mainers to better comply with our 
State Waste Hierarchy. Recapturing and utilizing waste heat from electricity generators, including WTEs, 
would be a worthy undertaking. Unfortunately, RECs for incineration looks too much like greenwashing 
to gain our members’ support.
Don’t Waste Maine is a citizens action group that supports waste policies that strengthen communities 
and protect the environment, with a focus on environmental justice.
Respectfully submitted on behalf of Don’t Waste Maine,
Ed Spencer and Bill Lippincott, co-chairs DWME
