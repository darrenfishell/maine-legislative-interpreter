Good after noon Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, an 
members of the Committee on Energy, Utilities, and 
technology. 
My name is Rod Carr and I am the Public Affairs Manager at 
Penobscot Energy Recovery Company (PERC) located in 
Orrington, Maine. 
I wish to provide information in support of LD 399 anda 
proposed amendment that we have been made aware of as it 
has been presently drafted. 
PERC, located in Orrington, Maine, is one of three waste- to 
energy facilities in l\/laine. For more than 30 years, PERC has 
played a key role in Maine's solid waste management 
hierarchy, keeping waste out of landfills by reducing waste by 
volume over 90 percent.i 
In 2018 PERC processed more than 200,000 tons of RDF that 
generated nearly 150,000 mw of electricity, enough to power 
nearly 15,000 homes. 
PERC is a zero liquid discharge waste-to-energy facility that 
combusts municipal solid waste, and is part of an integrated 
materials management system that converts waste materialsd
into renewable electric power, which qualifies it for certain 
Renewable Energy Credits class 2 (RECs). 
Waste-to-Energy facilities have qualified to receive class 2 RECs 
previously, but Maine law was amended in 2019 allowing 
Waste-to-Energy facilities to receive a 3X multiplier for its Class 
2 RECs. This 3X multiplier has been a life saver, allowing us to 
continue operating through COVID at time when many of 
PERC's personnel were out with sickness, and at a time when 
the ability to hire personnel was nonexistent. PERC also 
suffered through two fires, and most recently a major freeze up 
causing considerable damage during the last major cold spell. 
The Class 2 RECs, and 3X multiplier was a major piece in our 
recovery. Thank you, 
Rod Carr
