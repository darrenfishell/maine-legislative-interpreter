LD 399
Opposition to L.D. 399 and L.D.437
Dear Senate Chair Lawrence, House Chair Zeigler and Committee Members:
Please oppose both L.D.399 and L.D. 437 because the mission, purpose and goals of 
the REC program will not be achieved if they get moved forward. 
Incinerating recyclable plastics are clearly not, and never have been the intent of the 
REC program.
Following are direct quotes that substantiate opposition to both bills;   
Both bills do not move us closer to “achieve State’s goals for increased consumption of 
electricity from renewable resources.”
Both bills, are not “consistent with the public interest” because increasing the amounts of 
recyclable and non-recyclable waste does not meet the criteria of assuring that this source of 
electricity is “safe and reasonable.”
There is no ability at this time to carry out the energy generation “in conjunction with 
recycling.”
Here is the content copied verbatim today on 2/28/23 from the Town of Orrington website:
 
Please note that at this time we are not participating in the recycling program due to cost 
increase.  You may continue to put your recycling items curbside as you always have, and 
they will continue to be picked up.  However the items will not be RECYCLED, they will be 
taken to the PERC facility for incineration.  Should the cost for participating in the recycling 
program align with our budget, we will inform you at that time.  Continuing to place your items 
in a recycling container can assist you in several ways; more room in your household trash 
with less bulky items, maintaining the practice should recycling resume, etc.
Thank you for your thoughtful care of all Maine constituents to please oppose L.D. 
399 and L.D.437 because these proposals cannot comply with the intent and stated 
regulations of the REC program.
Respectfully,
Kerry Sack
Old Town
