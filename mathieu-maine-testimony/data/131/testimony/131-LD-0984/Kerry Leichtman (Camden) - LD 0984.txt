Re: LD 984, An Act to Expand Access to the Homestead Property Tax Exemption  
Chairpersons Grohoski  and Perry, and honorable members of the Taxation Committee : 
I offer testimony in opposition to LD 984 which seeks to expand a residentâ€™s benefit to a corporate entity. 
The Homestead Exemption is for permanent residents of the State of Maine. The exemption  is a benefit 
for people, not corporations . Besi des, a n LLC could be from anywhere in the world ; they are structured in 
such a way that we cannot know who its members are ; and w e would have no way to verify who is 
benefiting from the exemption.  
It is not unfair that a n LLC is unable to receive the same benefits as an individual. There is no 
equivalency between people living in their private residences and a revenue -generating LLC. Any 
additional Homestead Exemption funds the state of Maine decides to allocate should be  aimed to help 
seniors and the elderly stay in their homes. I urge that you vote Ought Not To Pass on this LD.  
Thank you for considering  my testimony.
