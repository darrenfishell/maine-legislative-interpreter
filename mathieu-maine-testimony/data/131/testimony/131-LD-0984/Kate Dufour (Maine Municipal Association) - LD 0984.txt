 
 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association  (MMA)  
 
In Opposition to  
LD 984, An Act to Expand Access to the Homestead  Exemption   
 
March 28 , 202 3 
 
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee.  My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in opposition to LD 984 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest.   
Municipal officials oppose e xpand ing homestead exemption eligibility  to include 
property  held by a limited liability company, regardless of whether a member of the company 
resides on property .  The change proposed in LD 984  lower s the eligibility bar and conflicts with 
a policy intentionally designed to narrowly target property tax relief to qualifying Maine 
homeowners.  Not only does the change erode the intended outcome  of that program,  but it also 
shifts additional b urden s onto the property taxpayer s, including beneficiaries of the exemption,  to 
fund the unreimbursed portion of the homestea d exemption, which in 2023 (and calculated based 
on state budget documents) is roughly $37 million.   
If the Legislature believe s this change is worthwhile, local leaders as k that state resources 
be used to fund and administer the program.   
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about our position, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 592 -4038.
