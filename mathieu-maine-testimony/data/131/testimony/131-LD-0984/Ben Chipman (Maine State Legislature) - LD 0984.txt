Committee on Taxation, my name is Ben Chipman, and I represent Senate District 28,__wl1ich» _‘ 
includes part of Portland in Cumberland County. I am before you today to introduce “-LD 984, 
. “An Act to Expand Access tothe Homestead Property Tax Exemption. ”~ .S
' 
This legislation_wo _uld _ _allows_homeowners who have their home registered as -a limited liability 
company (LLC) to receive the Homestead Property Tax Exemption. LD‘ 984 expands the." 
deﬁnitionof “Homestead ” to include homes that are registered in an LLC, but only when the 
home is occupied by apermanent year~round resident. The current law stipulates that the_ 
exemption does not -include owner-occupied properties registered in an LLC.' 
By adding owneroccupi_ed _ LLCs to the deﬁnition of “Homestead ” , small two or three unit 
buildings_regis'tered in an LLC where one of the units is occupied bya year-round Maine , 
resident, these homeowners are better ableto maintain theirbuildings and provide lower-cost 
housing for their tenants. Residents beneﬁt from lower rent when this exeinptionlifts the burden 
off "of landlords, th_ereby'-increasing accessibility to housing. In the current-housing crisis, it is 
important that we help landlords remain viable against larger land owners in order to support._

treated the same.-
