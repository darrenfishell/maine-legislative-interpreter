Testimony of the Office for Family Independence 
Department of Health and Human Services 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
In Support of LD 80 An Act to Improve Family Economic Security Under the Temporary 
Assistance for Neeafy Families Program 
Sponsored by: Representative Michele Meyer 
Hearing Date: February 16, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services, I am Anthony Pelotte, Director of the Ofﬁce for Family 
Independence at the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. Thank you for the 
opportunity to provide testimony on LD 80, An Act To Improve Family Economic Security 
Under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. We appreciate Representative 
Meyer’s sponsorship of this Department bill. This proposal will further reduce the “cliff effect” 
for those receiving assistance and will ensure the intent of Senator Stewart’s bill, An Act to 
Secure Transitions to Economic Prosperity for Maine Families and Children, also known as 
STEP, enacted as PLl9, Ch. 484‘ , and allow for a smoother transition ﬁom assistance for 
individuals transitioning to long term employment and self-suf ﬁciency. 
The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Parents as Scholars (PaS) Programs

employment goals and strive towards self—support. Statute requires applicants and recipients of 
TANF and PaS who have gig earnings to automatically receive an income disregard of 100% for 
3 months and then 75% for the following 3 months. This amendment will change from an 
automatic disregard for applicants with earnings to only impact recipients of TANF and PaS who 
begin employment or begin an increase in earnings while open on these programs. 
The intent of the PLI9, Ch. 484 was to create a gradual reduction of cash assistance upon 
retention of employment. The statute as written, requires all applicants with earned income to 
automatically exhaust the time-limited income disregard upon entering the program. This results 
in a sudden elimination of beneﬁts upon achieving improved employment while participating in 
the TANF program and contradicts the intent of the original legislation. It also utilizes the time 
limited disregard when individuals likely have lower wages or reduced work hours, which is why 
they are requesting TANF assistance. 
Studies have shown that many low-income families are more cautious in their employment 
decisions due to the fear of a sudden loss of beneﬁts? The proposed change would maximize the 
time limited impact of the income disregards for TANF and PaS families who become newly
