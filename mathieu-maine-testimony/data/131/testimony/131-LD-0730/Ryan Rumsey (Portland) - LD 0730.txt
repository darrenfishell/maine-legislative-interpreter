 Ryan Rumsey  March 23, 2023  Testimony in SUPPORT of LD 730  An Act to Provide Traffic Safety Education in Maine Schools  Good Afternoon members of the committee.  My name is Ryan Rumsey, and I am a 7th grade science  teacher at Lincoln Middle School in Portland Maine.   I am writing  to urge you to support LD 730, the Act  to Provide Traffic Safety Education in Maine Schools.  In my personal experience as a teacher, a walker, and a cyclist, I can say that:  1.  this information needs to be presented to students, who come to my class without much  knowledge of how to walk across a street safely, ride a bicycle responsibly, or who will one day  drive a car.  2.  the amount of time for instruction each year that this law asks is minimal and does not present a  burden to teachers and would be a welcomed addition to our curriculum or community of  learners.  In addition to teaching science at Lincoln Middle School, I am an avid bicycle rider. I ride a bicycle every  day of the week both as a bike commuter and a competitive cyclist. When the weather permits I ride 1  mile with my 6 year old to get to his elementary school. With my past experience and training as a  bicycle safety instructor my son is getting an education in how to be a safe pedestrian and a safe bicycle  rider. There is no doubt that when he is old enough to ride to school alone he will be safe and mindful of  the dangers of using sidewalks and bike lanes around runners, walkers, dog walkers, other cyclists, and  vehicles that may be being driven by a distracted driver. Don’t all kids deserve some education and  training on how to be a safe pedestrian, cyclist, or car driver who rides nearby the more vulnerable  pedestrian. Passing this traffic safety bill will ensure that all students receive some formal education on  how to stay safe and follow rules of the road.  For several  years I have also provided an extracurricular bicycle safety club to my students after school.  In this program we learn how to ride bikes safely in the urban areas around our school since many kids  ride their bikes to school. But programs like this only capture a small fraction of the kids that pass 
 through the school system each year. Shouldn't all students have access to this very relevant and  important education that would come about if this bill is passed.  Educating students about how to behave on the roads, whether walking, running, riding a bike, and  eventually driving, is part of modern civil society.  Sadly, my bicycle riding experience has made me all  too aware that some people have little clue of how to behave on the roads. I see other bike riders ignore  stop signs or ride against traffic.  I pass people walking with their backs to traffic.  I am passed by drivers  who don’t give me enough space, and who don’t seem to understand that they could easily injure me  with their cars.  Education like that proposed by this bill will make everyone aware of the rules and laws  that govern our roads and bike paths as well as understand proper etiquette by which all pedestrians and  drivers should drive, walk, and ride by to make our roads, sidewalks, and bike paths a safer place for all  ages.  Five years ago when I testified in front of the legislature a parent presented right before me. This parent  had recently lost a child who was killed in a crosswalk in Westbrook Maine. Two weeks ago a student of  mine was severely injured riding his electric bike down a road that was not suited for riding. I can only  ask if both of these incidents would be avoidable if everyone who was going to walk, run, ride bikes, or  drive a car had more understanding of how to be safer out on the roads and sidewalks. Knowing how to  safely negotiate public roads is a skill as fundamental to modern life as being able to read or do  arithmetic. It is our responsibility as parents, educators, car drivers, and pedestrians to ensure all kids get  equal access to these life lessons that will make our roads, crosswalks, and sidewalks safer for everyone.  Please support LD 730.  Thank you  Ryan Rumsey  ____________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Student Testimony 1:  Hello, my name is Chloe Allen and I am an 8th grade student at Windham Middle School.   I am here  today to support the idea of having schools teach bicycle and walking safety.  Knowing how to be safe on the roads is important because cars can be dangerous.  Knowing where to  walk on a road, how to cross the street, and how to be safe on a bicycle are important things.  Many  students have never had a class that taught them these things, but I think they should.  I think one class period each year would not interrupt our classrooms and would help make all students  become better decision makers on the roads and sidewalks.  Last year in Mr. Rumsey’s bike safety class I  learned many things such as how to signal when riding my bike to let drivers know where I am going, and  about the importance of wearing a helmet while riding a bike.  Thank you.  ___________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Student Testimony 2:  Hello, my name is Ava York and I am an 8th grade student at Windham Middle School.  I am here today  to support the idea of having schools teach bicycle and walking safety.  I like to ride my bike and walk.  I don’t really know if I’m doing everything right.  Mr. Rumsey taught me  some things about bike safety, but I don’t really know what the rules are for safe walking.  I think that a  class that taught us how to be safe on the roads would be a good idea.  Thank you

Testimony in SUPPORT of LD 730 
An Act to Provide Traffic Safety Education in Maine Schools
Good Afternoon members of the committee.  My name is Ryan Rumsey, and I am a 7th grade
science teacher at Lincoln Middle School in Portland Maine.   I am writing  to urge you to 
support LD 730, the Act to Provide Traffic Safety Education in Maine Schools.  
In my personal experience as a teacher, a walker, and a cyclist, I can say that: 
1. this information needs to be presented to students, who come to my class without much 
knowledge of how to walk across a street safely, ride a bicycle responsibly, or who will one 
day drive a car. 
2. the amount of time for instruction each year that this law asks is minimal and does not 
present a burden to teachers and would be a welcomed addition to our curriculum or 
community of learners. 
In addition to teaching science at Lincoln Middle School, I am an avid bicycle rider. I 
ride a bicycle every day of the week both as a bike commuter and a competitive 
cyclist. When the weather permits I ride 1 mile with my 6 year old to get to his 
elementary school. With my past experience and training as a bicycle safety instructor
my son is getting an education in how to be a safe pedestrian and a safe bicycle rider. 
There is no doubt that when he is old enough to ride to school alone he will be safe 
and mindful of the dangers of using sidewalks and bike lanes around runners, walkers,
dog walkers, other cyclists, and vehicles that may be being driven by a distracted 
driver. Don’t all kids deserve some education and training on how to be a safe 
pedestrian, cyclist, or car driver who rides nearby the more vulnerable pedestrian. 
Passing this traffic safety bill will ensure that all students receive some formal 
education on how to stay safe and follow rules of the road. 
For several  years I have also provided an extracurricular bicycle safety club to my 
students after school.  In this program we learn how to ride bikes safely in the urban 
areas around our school since many kids ride their bikes to school. But programs like 
this only capture a small fraction of the kids that pass through the school system each
