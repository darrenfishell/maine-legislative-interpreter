LD 730
Dear Legislators,
I am writing in support of LD 730.  As a veteran teacher in Maine schools I firmly 
believe this bill would benefit students in several ways.  First of all it would help 
current riders ride safely.  Bike accidents are dangerous and can even be deadly.   If 
required safety education saved one student from a dangerous fall or collision with a 
motor vehicle it would be worth it.  Secondly, bike safety education would create 
interest and excitement in students for biking.  Physical activity and fitness levels in 
Maine’s children are some of the lowest in the nation.  Getting more kids outdoors 
and on bikes is one small way to improve the health of Maine’s most precious 
resource.  LD 730 is written in a way that gives flexibility in how schools implement 
it.  Schools can prepare their own lessons or take advantage of the excellent resources 
from organizations like the Bicycle Coalition of Maine.  Please pass this important 
legislation and add to the health and safety of the next generation.
