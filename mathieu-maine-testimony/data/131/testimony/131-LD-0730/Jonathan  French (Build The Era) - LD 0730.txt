The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 154.1 An Overview of Traffic Safety and Mobility Education in Europe
The responsibility for traffic safety and mobility education thus lies with the Member 
States in Europe. Without a unifying framework at European level, this raises the question of how Member States individually approach road safety education. Are there distinct differences and similarities to be found in their approaches? 
This report presents a first overview of how traffic safety and mobility education is 
given in EU Member States (and other European countries – see box). The report highlights general trends in Europe, while giving examples of the countries’ individual approaches. An overview per country for several of the overview’s themes is set out in the annexes.
This report looks at all EU Member States, except for Romania for which no data were 
available. Belgium was divided into Flanders and Wallonia as road safety education is a community competence 
22, while the United Kingdom was similarly divided into 
England & Wales on the one hand, and Scotland on the other.23  In addition to the EU’s 
Member States, Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina’s Republic of Srpska, Iceland, Kosovo24, 
Norway, Serbia and Switzerland provided data for this report.
ETSC, Fundación MAPFRE and VSV are grateful to the national experts who provided 
the information on which this overview of traffic safety and mobility education is based.
22 In Belgium, the competence for education lies with the country’s three community authorities (Flemish, French 
and German-speaking). Given the small size of the latter (80,000 inhabitants), we have chosen to focus on the 
situation in the Flemish and French communities. These are referred to as “Flanders” and “Wallonia” respectively 
in this report, although this is not fully correct political terminology.  
23 Northern Ireland has not been included in this report due to insufficient data.  
24 Throughout this report this designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 
1244 and the ICJ opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 174.1.1 Traffic Safety and Mobility Education across Europe
Road safety education is given at primary schools in all European countries. For Croatia, the 
Netherlands, Serbia and Wallonia this is also the only level of education at which children 
are generally given road safety lessons. For the large majority (81%) of states, road safety education is also given at secondary schools, while in a slightly slimmer majority (69%) of 
states it is given at pre-primary education. 
In Malta and England & Wales as well as in the Czech Republic, Germany and Ireland, 
traffic safety and mobility education is furthermore given at tertiary education, with the latter group representing the only three states in Europe where such education is given at 
every level of education. 
In 21 states road safety education is given at three levels, with lessons given at pre-primary, 
primary and secondary levels being the most frequently used form (19 states). 
4.1.2 Where is Traffic Safety and Mobility Education Required by Law?
While road safety education is given in all European countries, 12 states do not require 
schools to provide road safety education at any level by law. Most states (24) however 
require such education to be given at elementary schools.
15 states furthermore require road safety education to be given at secondary level, while 
14 states require it at pre-primary. No state in Europe requires road safety education at 
tertiary level.

4.1.3 Who is Responsible for Traffic Safety Education?
In most states (81%), the final responsibility for traffic safety education lies with the Ministry 
of Education. This responsibility is furthermore sometimes shared with other actors, for 
example with the Ministry of Transport (5), the police (5), a governmental agency (2) and 
non-governmental organisations (3). In Luxembourg, this responsibility is also shared with 
a commercial organisation. 
In Finland and the Netherlands this responsibility lies with a governmental agency, such as 
the Finnish National Agency for Education. In Scotland, the governmental agency Transport 
Scotland is responsible for the co-ordination of national road safety education activities, 
while the implementation is the responsibility of Scotland’s 32 local authorities. In England 
& Wales the responsibility for road safety education lies with the local highway authorities. 
In Ireland, uniquely, the Ministry for Transport is the entity ultimately responsible, although 
in practice the Road Safety Authority is responsible for the implementation and delivery.
Only in Denmark and Sweden does no government authority have the final responsibility 
for road safety education, and instead responsibility is placed on respectively the school and 
the headmaster. However, while schools in Denmark are required to teach traffic safety 
education, this is not verified by any Ministry, resulting in a variety of efforts taken by the 
schools with some teaching it, while others do not.
In Germany, the responsibility for school education is with the Federal States. Only pre-
school education as well as tertiary education is under the competence of the national level. 
With the aim to provide harmonised traffic education at school level, the Conference of 
Ministers of Education of the Federal States have however agreed on common basic rules 
related to the content and the quality of traffic education.25 
4.1.4 The Supply of Educational Material
Traffic safety education material is provided by more than one supplier in the vast majority 
of European states. Some publishing companies have specialised in the development of 
road safety and mobility teaching material and work closely with educational authorities. 
Road safety and mobility-related NGOs also develop teaching materials. In Germany, the 
Association of Accident Insurers as well as the insurance sector also develop teaching and 
learning materials.
In Croatia no separate educational material is provided as the topic is part of another 
subject at school. In Iceland and Lithuania the material is provided solely by the Ministry of 
Education, while in Latvia this is done by the Road Traffic Safety Directorate. 
Greece’s Institute of Education Policy has set up a website where teachers can download 
approved material from various organisations, such as the Ministry for Transport and RSI 
Panos Mylonas (an NGO).
Given that road safety education is given predominantly at primary and secondary levels of 
education, this report will focus in more detail on how education is given and organised at 
these two levels. However, the next section will first provide an overview of how teachers 
are educated on traffic safety and mobility issues.
5.2 The Education of Teachers
How traffic safety and mobility education is addressed during the education of teachers 
differs greatly across Europe. In Albania, the Netherlands and Switzerland it is only addressed 
to a very limited extent at teacher training colleges. There is also no regular provision of 
such education for teachers in France as well as England & Wales, although in the latter 
region local projects have tried to introduce this, albeit not consistently over time.

The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 19In the Czech Republic, Finland and Norway it depends on the college whether or not 
the teacher is trained in traffic safety and mobility education, while in Iceland and 
Serbia such training is offered as elective courses. Teachers in Germany receive some 
training during an internship period after having finalised their tertiary education.
In Cyprus, periodical seminars to train teachers are organised by the Pedagogical 
Institute. Non-mandatory seminars are also organised in Portugal, where accredited 
training activities have been developed for teachers of various levels of education, as 
well as in Greece, where training has been based on good practices from EU funded 
projects such as AVENUE for Traffic Safety.26
In Slovenia meetings for teachers are regularly organised, notably for those teachers 
who coordinate the cycling exam for fifth graders, while in Italy training is provided 
during information days. 
Information is provided to teachers in Ireland, where stands with materials are 
available in tertiary education institutes, in Lithuania, where teachers receive updated 
methodological material, and in Scotland, where local governments’ road safety 
teams deliver material adapted to the needs of the training college. Teachers in Ireland 
are also provided with road safety programmes that have been developed with the 
involvement of teachers. 
In both Flanders and Wallonia, traffic safety and mobility education is not part of the 
curriculum. Nevertheless, non-mandatory training by different NGOs is offered in both 
communities of Belgium. In Denmark, trainee teachers receive a brief introduction to 
educational material provided by the Danish Road Safety Council.
Only in Poland and Slovakia is traffic safety included in teacher training programmes. In 
Poland, teachers giving road safety education need to complete a dedicated 18-month 
post-graduate course in ‘techniques with elements of road safety education’. In 
addition, teachers who prepare pupils for a “bicycle licence” need to have completed 
a 1- or 2-day course. Although no such education exists yet in Hungary, a project is 
ongoing which would implement a module on the education of road safety.
4.3 Primary Education
4.3.1 Time Spent Learning
Traffic safety and mobility education is not a dedicated subject at primary schools in 
the majority (72%) of states in Europe. A slighter larger majority of states (78%) do not 
mandate a minimum number of teaching hours by law. 
Interestingly, out of the ten states in which road safety education is a dedicated subject, 
only Austria and the Czech Republic have also set a required minimum number of 
teaching hours. Conversely, a minimum number of hours is required in Albania, 
Republic of Srpska, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Slovakia, even though it is not a 
dedicated subject there.
The minimum number of teaching hours required by law varies significantly between 
states. While children in Hungary receive 6 lessons of 45 minutes per year, children in 
the Czech Republic receive 20 hours of road safety education per year, and in Republic 
of Srpska the number is 23 hours per year (and 40 hours for optional classes). 
In Greece, the number of hours varies for the different grades. While grades 1, 3 and 
4 receive road safety lessons for 1 hour per week during one trimester, this is 1 hour 
per week for the whole year for grade 2. Ten hours per year are furthermore given to 
Greek children in grades 5 and 6.

20 | The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe
 The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 21In states where there is no minimum hour requirement, the number of teaching hours 
also varies widely, both between states as well as within states. In the Netherlands 
children receive roughly 45 minutes of road safety education each week. Teachers in 
Lithuania dedicate 40 hours per year, teachers in Slovenia 25 hours, and teachers in 
Malta 10 to 20 hours.
In Cyprus, 10 to 15 sessions of 45 minutes are given each year, while the topic is 
addressed at most one hour a month in France and Latvia. In Luxembourg one activity 
a year is dedicated to road safety, while in Iceland an expert provides an hour of road 
safety education each spring, after which the teacher continues the lessons. 
In Flanders, children have on average 20 hours of road safety education each year, 
however this varies considerably by school, as is the case in Belgium’s other community, 
Wallonia, where it varies from 10 days a year to none at all. Although there is a big 
variety in the amount of road safety lessons in Denmark, these lessons are primarily 
given to the youngest pupils and much less to the older.
It also varies a lot across Sweden, as it is up to the school’s headmaster to decide how 
much time is reserved for teaching children about road safety. The same decision is left 
to the teachers in Portugal and Poland. Moreover, teachers in the latter state remarked 
that the time currently dedicated to the topic was limited and they would like to have 
more time for it, especially in grades where the “bicycle licence” programme is given.
In seven states it was unknown or too difficult to estimate how many hours of road 
safety education was given on average in elementary schools. For example, teaching 
hours in Norway are decided for the whole year and cover all main subject areas, 
basic skills and competence aims. Therefore, as the schools are supposed to work 
interdisciplinary, it is impossible to report how many lessons per year or per month are 
given for one single topic within the subject. In Norway they underline the importance 
of also giving traffic education when the children are outdoors, either playing in the 
neighbourhood or going on a trip.
Similarly, for Estonia and Kosovo it was also not possible to estimate the average amount 
of hours spent on traffic safety and mobility education, as the subject is integrated in 
other subjects. This is similar to Germany, where mobility and road safety education 
is integrated into the syllabus in primary schools, but with different amount of hours 
depending on the Federal State.
4.3.2 Structure of the Lessons and Exams
The traffic safety education lessons contain both theoretical and practical elements in 
almost all states in Europe, except for Albania, Kosovo, Latvia and Portugal, where only 
theoretical lessons are given. Nowhere in Europe is road safety education given only 
through practical lessons.
Exams are not held for road safety education in the majority of European states (67%). 
Albania and Kosovo do have written exams, while Wallonia, the Czech Republic, and 
Lithuania hold practical exams. Children in Flanders, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, 
Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland have both a written and practical exam. In Norway, 
70% of the schools use the NCRS’ educational bicycle learning resources, including the 
“cycling test”, however this is not considered an exam.Structure of the 
Lessons and Exams

The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 214.3.3 What Do Children Learn?
The topics generally addressed in elementary schools across Europe can be defined in 
two broad categories: traffic rules and safe behaviour. 
In most states, children are taught about the traffic rules and the meaning of traffic signs 
when they are in elementary school. Most children across Europe also receive lessons 
in safe behaviour on the road focussing primarily on behaving safely as a pedestrian 
and cyclist, including lessons on how to cross the road safely. Several countries also 
focus on how to behave safely using public transport and as a passenger in a car. 
Lessons are furthermore dedicated to how to get safely from home to school in 
Bulgaria, Iceland, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Serbia and England & 
Wales. In Finland, Germany and Sweden, the road safety of their local neighbourhood 
is focused on during the lessons.
Children also learn how to recognise the risks on the roads as well as how to deal 
with them in Austria, Flanders, Denmark, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Lithuania, the 
Netherlands and Serbia. The use of protective as well as safety equipment is furthermore 
taught to children at elementary schools in Finland, Poland and Serbia. 
A differentiation between age groups in primary education is also made in several 
states. For example, young children in elementary schools in Denmark are trained in 
being a safe pedestrian, while pupils of 11 and 12 years of age receive bicycle training. 
In Scotland, the younger children are, amongst others, taught to wear a seatbelt and 
crossing roads safely, while for older primary school children the focus is more about 
not being distracted while on the road, making the safest choice possible and dealing 
with peer pressure.
In Germany, the former “road safety” education moved into a broader “mobility” 
education taking into account not only the safety aspects, but also sustainability and 
environment, social competence and independent mobility. 
4.3.4 Educational Goals
Educational goals and/or objectives for traffic safety and mobility education are set in 
a majority of states (64%). Across the EU, these goals follow the topics taught in class 
and can therefore also be generalised in objectives on understanding traffic rules and 
signs on the one hand, and objectives on acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary 
to behave safely in traffic as a pedestrian, cyclist or passenger on the other hand.
In Flanders for example, educational objectives are already set at pre-primary education 
level (kindergarten), with goals set to recognise in their surroundings where they can 
play safely and where not, to realise that traffic involves risks and to be able to apply 
elementary traffic rules under supervision.
For primary education, the objectives in Flanders are split into traffic education 
objectives and mobility education objectives. The former includes the goals of 
identifying dangerous traffic situations in the wider school environment, having the 
necessary skills and understanding of traffic rules to be able to move independently 
and safely as a pedestrian and cyclist on familiar routes, and showing a willingness to 
take into account other road users.
The goals for mobility education at primary schools in Flanders include that the pupils 
know the most important consequences of the growing use of cars, to be able to 
compare the pros and cons of possible alternatives, and that they are able to plan a 
simple route with public transport.Education 
GoalsTraffic Rules and 
Safe Behaviour

22 | The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe
 The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 23In Finland, the goals for first and second graders amongst others focus on the pupils’ 
independent and safe mobility in their surroundings and improving skills and knowledge as 
pedestrians and cyclists. During the third to sixth grades, the goal is to widen the children’s 
independent mobility to a larger area and to include public transport. Special focus is 
placed on their safe cycling skills and ensuring their own and other people’s safety.
The required outcomes as defined in the road safety curriculum in Serbia for grades 1 
through 4 include that children behave safely when walking from home to school, and 
understand that the road and the pavement are not play areas.
For fifth grade the goals include the ability to make a distinction between safe and unsafe 
behaviour of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, to behave properly as a road user, to use 
protective equipment while riding a bicycle and to understand the necessity of wearing a 
seat belt, as well as acting responsibly as a passenger and showing respect to other road 
users. 
Sixth graders in Serbia also have to understand the connection between good infrastructure 
and the safety of its users, and demonstrate correct and safe behaviour as pedestrians and 
cyclists in a mock-up road layout and/or via computer simulation.
In Norway there are specific competence aims related to physical education, in which the 
aim of the training is to enable the pupil to comply with traffic rules for pedestrians and 
bicyclists after the fourth grade and to enable the pupil to ride a bicycle safely as a means 
of transport after the seventh grade. In addition, the pupil has to explain why physical 
activity is important in everyday life.
4.3.5 Who Provides the Lessons?
It is common across Europe that the lessons could be given by different entities in primary 
education. In the majority of states (67%), the teacher responsible for the class usually give 
the road safety lessons to the children, while in 15 states a teacher responsible for a certain 
subject may give the lessons.
Only in Denmark is a dedicated teacher for traffic safety and mobility education a possibility. 
While the teacher in Switzerland is also a teacher dedicated to the subject, this is mostly a 
police officer. Police officers furthermore provide lessons or assistance in Austria, Belgium, 
Cyprus, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal and Serbia. While primary school teachers in 
Germany give the general mobility and safety lessons, the cycling training and exam are 
done by police officers who are specially trained.
It is also common that the lessons are given by external experts, which include the previously 
mentioned police officers. This is the case in 61% of the European states. In roughly half 
these cases, the external experts are not paid for the lessons they give. In Iceland and 
Portugal the schools themselves pay for the external experts, and while this is also the 
case for Belgium and the Netherlands, governmental authorities in those states share this 
burden with the schools. Governmental authorities in Hungary and Ireland solely carry the 
costs for the external expert in their schools. 
The Road Safety Authority in Ireland provides a National Road Safety Education Service 
where ten dedicated Road Safety Promotions Officers visit each school in a three year 
cycle.
External interventions in France are mainly made on a voluntary basis, while certain experts 
in Denmark also provide their lessons for free. In Cyprus and Greece, the external experts 
belong to a non-profit organisation, which in turn receives subsidies from sponsors for 
various activities, which could include traffic safety lessons at schools.
 
Who Provides 
the Lessons
The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 234.4 Secondary Education
This section sets out the status of traffic safety and mobility education in the 
29 European states where it is generally given at secondary levels. As this type of 
education is generally not given in the remaining seven, they have not been included 
in this analysis.
4.4.1 Time Spent Learning
Road safety education is a dedicated subject at secondary schools only in France, 
Iceland, Italy, Norway and Switzerland. None of these countries however have a 
minimum legal requirement for the amount of hours that the subject should be given 
at secondary schools. Such a requirement is only found in Albania (12 hours per year), 
Cyprus (eight 45 minute lessons per year), and Slovakia.
Of the states where there is no legal minimum requirement, only in Latvia do pupils 
receive traffic safety education once a month. In Greece, a ‘thematic week’ has been 
introduced for the first three grades of secondary school, during which the teacher 
can choose out of four subjects related to health, including traffic safety. For the latter 
three grades in Greece’s secondary education, traffic education activities are also a 
possibility during a dedicated teaching day in the last four months of the school year.
In the other states it is less structured and furthermore not well known. In France for 
example, pupils receive generally less than four hours of road safety education per year, 
however they do not receive lessons every year. While French pupils between 11 and 
15 have two compulsory theoretical exams, the teachers are not required to prepare 
the pupils for these exams. In addition, a half-day road safety awareness training is 
compulsory in high schools and apprentice schools, although no exam is taken at the 
end of the training.
Pupils in Iceland may have two days of road safety education in spring as well as a few 
trips where traffic rules are reviewed. In both Flanders and Slovenia, the amount differs 
greatly from school to school, with 1 to 2 days generally given in Flanders, and lectures 
lasting between one and six hours given in Slovenia.
In Austria and Portugal, the amount of road safety education is decided upon by the 
teachers, while in Denmark, Hungary and Malta this depends on the school. Also in 
Sweden there is a lot of variation between schools across the country.
For Bulgaria, Estonia, Kosovo, and Poland it was difficult to estimate how many hours 
of education was given to pupils, as the subject was integrated in other subjects. It was 
similarly difficult to estimate it for Finland, because the subject is generally offered as 
an optional course.
Also for Norway it was difficult to estimate how many hours of traffic education are 
generally given, as pupils can choose an elective course on road safety and traffic in 
addition to their normal curriculum. If chosen, the pupil would have two hours of 
classes per week, however it is up to the school to decide which choice of subjects 
they want to offer to the pupils. The course can furthermore be set up in a way that 
would allow pupils to take the first part of their driving licence trajectory as part of the 
subject. Schools would however have to follow the provisions of the Traffic Training 
Regulation in such case.

 The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 254.4.2 Structure of the Lessons and Exams
Contrary to primary education, the traffic safety and mobility education lessons at 
secondary level are solely theoretical in the majority of states (16), while in the other 
13 states it is both theoretical as well as practical. Nowhere in Europe are only practical 
road safety lessons given to pupils in secondary schools.
No exams are taken in 25 of the 29 states where traffic safety and mobility education is 
generally given at secondary level. While a written test is conducted in Albania, France 
and Kosovo, only in Slovakia do pupils have written as well as practical exams.
4.4.3 What Do Youngsters Learn?
Knowledge on traffic rules, safe behaviour (as a pedestrian, cyclist, passenger and 
public transport user) as well as recognising and avoiding risks remain important topics 
taught at secondary schools.
A significant amount of states furthermore address the risks and challenges of being 
a young driver, including the risks of speeding as well as driving under the influence 
of alcohol and drugs. The danger of distraction, notably by smartphones, is also 
addressed, not only in the context of being a young driver, but also as a pedestrian, 
cyclist or rider. Austria, Flanders, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Latvia furthermore 
focus specifically on driving mopeds safely as well.
Pupils in Denmark, France, England & Wales as well as Scotland receive lessons in 
recognising the effects of peer pressure and dealing with the pressure to take high-risk 
actions by saying no.
Children in Cyprus furthermore examine statistical data on road accidents and develop 
proposals for improving the safety of young road users, while sustainable mobility 
concepts are introduced to pupils in Greece.
Sustainable mobility also features prominently in Germany, where pupils are given 
lessons in amongst others alternatively powered engines and technologies, the 
economic and environmental aspects of mobility, as well as the development and 
design of future-oriented sustainable mobility.
4.4.4 Educational Goals
Educational goals and/or objectives for road safety education are only set in 14 out of 
the 29 states where traffic safety and mobility education is generally given at secondary 
level. Out of those 14 states, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia 
furthermore set different educational goals and/or objectives for different levels of 
education, i.e. traffic education differs for students preparing for vocational school 
compared to those preparing for university. 
In Flanders, only general objectives for road safety education at secondary level are set 
in the framework of personal health and safety goals, and include being able to apply 
traffic rules and using personal and public transport safely. The objectives are however 
not binding and furthermore no exam is taken to verify they are met.
While all pupils in Cyprus’ secondary schools should develop appropriate behaviour 
on the road, be able to provide first aid and be able to judge the human, social and 
cultural factors contributing to collisions, different additional objectives are set for the 
first three years of secondary education and the last three years. What Do 
Youngsters Learn?

The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 25During the first three years, 12- to 14-year-olds are expected to develop the abilities 
to identify and evaluate factors causing collisions as well as the means to protect 
themselves, to behave safely with others in their daily environment, and to engage 
with personal and collective actions to prevent, reduce or even eliminate road collisions. 
During the last three years, 15- to 18-year-olds are also expected to identify the factors 
that could affect their behaviour as a pedestrian, cyclist, passenger and as a future 
young driver.
In Norway, specific competence aims for after the tenth grade are set and are related 
to the natural sciences subject curriculum, elaborating on how traffic safety equipment 
prevents and reduces injuries in collisions.
In Denmark, no formal objectives are established by a Ministry. However, the Danish 
Road Safety Council does provide schools with a chart on the theory of change that 
includes objectives as expected outcomes.

26 | The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe
 The status of traffic safety and mobility education in Europe | 274.4.5 Who Provides the Lessons?
Traffic safety and mobility education is also given by different entities in secondary 
education, and in 11 states it could be given by different actors. For example, the 
lessons in Iceland and Italy could be given by the teacher responsible for the class, the 
teacher responsible for a certain subject or by an external expert.
It is common for the teacher responsible for a certain subject to provide road safety 
education in 15 states, while in 10 states the teacher responsible for the class could 
give such education. Only in Norway and Switzerland would a dedicated traffic safety 
and mobility education teacher provide the lessons. However, in Switzerland this is 
usually a police officer.
External experts provide road safety lessons in 14 states. In Italy, Malta, Poland, Spain 
and Sweden, such an external expert would not be paid for the lessons, while in Iceland 
and Portugal the schools pay the external experts. Ireland and Slovakia are the only 
states where the relevant ministry would pay the external expert to give such lessons, 
while Switzerland is the only state in which the police sometimes fund the lessons by 
the external expert.
The lessons in Denmark are free if the external expert is provided by the Danish 
Road Safety Council, however if provided by other experts a cost could be charged. 
In Slovenia, the police or governmental agencies provide such lessons for free, while 
experts from non-governmental organisations would be paid for the lessons provided.
In Flanders, the funding for external experts is shared between the school and VSV 
as the governmental agency, while in Cyprus and Greece the external experts belong 
to a non-governmental organisation which in turn may be subsidised by sponsors to 
provide such lessons to schools. 
In Greece, an external expert is usually invited by the teacher who has undertaken 
the responsibility to teach or coordinate traffic education in one or different grades 
and classes, with the associated costs for implementing the educational programmes 
usually covered by governmental agencies and municipal authorities as well as private 
sponsors. 
The ten previously mentioned dedicated Road Safety Promotions Officers in Ireland also 
visit each secondary school in a three-year cycle.

How traffic gardens can teach children to safely navigate active
transportation methods
Active transportation is beneficial for the environment; individual health; equitable and
inclusive access to employment opportunities, amenities and rich resources of a region; and
sense of community well-being and belonging. Bicycling, in particular , is a lifetime activity
that provides enhanced mobility , independence and enjoyment.
Early life influences profoundly impact patterns of behavior . Children who engage in physical
activity are more likely to engage as adults and to remain healthy into their adolescence. Y et,
as a function of age and ability , children are less independent and are physically and
cognitively more vulnerable. Further , they can behave impulsively , have dif ficulty self-
regulating, be distracted from tasks, and are challenged with spatial discrimination. Many
lack reading ability , English proficiency , or warning directives/symbol recognition.
2 / 4While streets and public places should be a right and accessible to all, there are inherent
safety issues in the built environment. Y et, children have great capacity for curiosity and
learning through experience. It is, therefore, imperative that children engage in transportation
activities in a safe space that will enhance their knowledge, awareness, access to
opportunities, independence and well-being across their lifespan. Key to student learning is
involvement in appropriately challenging play in settings that imitate real situations and are
personally relevant.
Traffic Gardens as Safe Spaces for Learning and Play
Traffic gardens (also known as safety towns/villages/cities or traf fic parks) are miniature city
streetscapes with a network of reduced-sized streets, scaled traf fic elements (e.g.,
roundabouts, directional traf fic patterns, intersections, parking spaces, food truck spaces)
and appropriate signage. As community amenities, these often are constructed on
underutilized parking lots, community spaces, recreational facilities and park grounds, and
school playgrounds. T raffic gardens provide small worlds in which children can learn about
traffic rules, safe navigation of cities, resolution of conflicts, and how to appropriately handle
interactions with other travelers on the roadway . Children are able to walk, maneuver
motorized wheelchairs, ride bikes, steer scooters, drive pedal cars and negotiate a
community of their own in these spaces.
Sheila Hensley , a pre-kindergarten (pre-K) teacher at Aiton Elementary School in
Washington, D.C., says: “Children in D.C. are cognizant as 3-year-olds about traf fic. Some 4-
and 5-year-olds ride the bus alone; they are already navigating the streets at a very early
age, so the traf fic garden is very important to start at a young age.” In addition, traf fic
gardens serve as safe, reality-based spaces for imaginative, creative, dramatic and risky
play, and provide opportunities for enhanced risk competence, resilience, well-being and a
more complete understanding of the environment.
The focus on traf fic safety education for children emerged in the United States in the 1920s,
with school-based road safety essay contests and the formation of school safety patrols.
These school-based models became insuf ficient in a period of rapid adoption of motor
vehicle use and an increase in child roadway fatalities, and precipitated innovations, such as
safety towns. The first recorded traf fic garden in the world was installed in Mansfield, Ohio, in
1937, initiated by a local patrol of ficer. Shortly thereafter , the Model T raffic Area No. 1 was
developed in T ottenham, United Kingdom (UK). It was a more sophisticated project, publicly
funded, and received widespread attention. Subsequent plans for a series of similar facilities
around the UK were derailed by W orld W ar II, while in the United States, this community-
based idea was highlighted in the media and spread through local champions. By the 1960s
and into the 1980s, momentum was fostered through the National Safety T own Center , which
also produced curriculum and program materials. By this time, many facilities had become
much more elaborate, featuring actual streets, curbs, buildings and operating traf fic signals.
3 / 4Children were brought to safety towns as part of school activities and learning opportunities
were generally led by local police of ficers. Families visited as tourist destinations and
locations for play and recreation.
Today , traffic gardens are “sprouting” all over as a result of an enhanced societal focus on
equity , inclusion and access within communities; environmental sustainability (and creative
repurposing of under-utilized or ill-maintained asphalt); the need for active transportation;
and the availability of improved installation materials for new sites.
Traffic Garden Case Study: W ashington, D.C. Public Schools
The “Mason T eam” — consisting of George Mason University , Discover T raffic Gardens, T orti
Gallas + Partners, Safe Routes to Schools National Partnership and W ashington Area
Bicyclist Association — engaged in a multi-faceted project, funded through the District
Department of T ransportation (DDOT) V ision Zero grant, and focused on the design,
construction and installation of two traf fic gardens at a public elementary school in Northeast
Washington, D.C., (an urban, under-resourced, majority Black jurisdiction). The Mayor ’s
Vision Zero initiative focuses on reducing, and ultimately eliminating, transportation fatalities
and serious injuries in the District of Columbia.
Through a series of charrettes (i.e., concept design workshops), more than 130 students,
teachers, families and community members lent their voices to the collaborative design of
the traf fic gardens, thus creating ownership of their space. The Mason T eam then refined the
design, purchased key traf fic garden elements, and oversaw installation of the traf fic gardens
and programming of celebratory activities. “W e involved the community; we involved the
students that participated in laying out what they thought their traf fic gardens should look
like. W e did the same for parents, inviting them in so that they [could] share what they
envisioned. But having it back there [behind the school]…everyone benefits,” says Dr .

Curricular materials and activity kits (including mini lessons, felt boards and characters, a
song, and teacher training documents) were developed and provided to teachers to facilitate
dramatic play in the pre-K classroom and encourage challenging free play in the outdoor
traffic gardens. All materials were carefully crafted to be developmentally appropriate and
model culturally sensitive practices. Pre-K students learned about transportation networks,
safety awareness in the built environment and risk competence, as well as gaining familiarity
with use of balance bikes. These activities provided scaf folded learning for children who will
develop into second graders required to participate in a comprehensive District of Columbia
Public Schools bike education program, “Biking in the Park.” For current second graders, the
traffic gardens served as a bridge from the classroom instruction to the end-of-session five-
to six-mile bike ride on D.C. streets to a local park.
4 / 4Key to the success of this project was an engaged team of stakeholders, collaboration with
the DDOT , D.C. Public Schools and school personnel, and intentional and ongoing
interactions with the school communities. This was achieved through school events, activities
to engage the community members in production of felt boards for lessons, volunteer action
within the schools, and celebrations surrounding ribbon-cutting ceremonies.
Engaging children and the community in design of the traf fic gardens empowered them as
civic-minded agents of change and impacted their collective well-being. “During COVID, the
traffic garden installations provided an ideal way to get kids outdoors, practice biking and
bike safety , and interact as a community , while maintaining social distancing, mask-wearing
and adherence to COVID protocols,” says Lauren Hassel, former Safe Routes to School
coordinator for Arlington (V irginia) Public Schools. “The traf fic gardens also allowed families
to re-connect.”
Development of these traf fic gardens was found to change community perceptions of safety
and the built environment. This is critical to whether children spend more time playing,
interacting in the environment, or walking or biking to school. Creative and challenging play ,
as well as physical activity , contribute to children’ s cognitive, social and emotional
development (e.g., enjoyment, conflict resolution, resilience, problem solving, self-confidence
and independence). Further , exposing children to traf fic gardens as high-value and safe
learning and play spaces will help them better maneuver the built environment and engage in
active transportation, as well as ensure patterns of enjoyment, healthy behavior , improved
equity through access to the resources and amenities of their community , inclusivity , overall
well-being, and sense of belonging. The traf fic gardens serve as a mechanism for creating a
better world, one child at a time.
