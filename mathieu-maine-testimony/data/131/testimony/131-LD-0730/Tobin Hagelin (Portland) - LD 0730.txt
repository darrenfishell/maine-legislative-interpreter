Testimony in SUPPORT of LD 730– 
“An Act to Provide Traffic Safety Education in Maine”

Good Afternoon. My name is Tobin Hagelin. I am an ELL teacher at Scarborough Middle 
School. I urge you to vote yes for LD- 470 to provide traffic safety education in Maine schools.
LD-470 seeks to provide one hour per year of bicycle and pedestrian safety to Maine 
students, grades 2 through 12. This legislation provides important safety education training to 
Maine students and seeks to combat the steep rise in fatalities on Maine’s roadways. 
I’m sorry I could not be with you in person, today, but as you might expect, I am teaching. As 
an ELL teacher, I urge you to vote in favor of this legislation for the following reasons: 
● Because of language and cultural barriers, many students to not receive proper information related to 
bike/ped safety 
● My student population needs to receive direct instruction because there is little incidental learning on
these topics in the home; students often do not have the background information on basic safety rules 
that children born in the country have 
● Many students come from cultures where the rules are completely different from here in Maine; 
without direct instruction, they do not have the opportunity to learn about bike/ped safety in this 
country. 
● Promoting safe bike and pedestrian behavior is instrumental to promoting healthy lifestyles and 
combatting Maine’s obesity epidemic. 
As a teacher, I am well aware of the heavy burden teachers carry; however, this legislation, 
requiring one hour per year of education to make sure our students are healthy and safe is 
not a lot to ask, particularly considering the curriculum is provided as well as the instructors if 
requested. I urge you to support this bill. Thank you for your time and consideration.
