Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 730, An Act to Provide Traffic Safety Education in Schools  proposes to require all school 
administrative units to provide age -appropriate traffic safety education at least 1 hour annually to 
students in grades 2 to 12.  
This bill outlines specific curriculum content which fits within and can be delivered as part of a 
quality, comprehensive health education curriculum  that emphasize s supporting implementation 
of health education in the elementary and middle school instruct ion  
As indicated in Title 20 -A, §2(2), the control and management of the public schools shall be 
vested in the legislative and governing bodies of local school administrative units, as long as 
those units are in compliance with appropriate state statutes.  This policy of “local control” 
provides communities with a stronger voice in critical decisions in how education is to be 
provided, including decisions about specific program and curriculum decisions.   
The Health Education and Physical Education standards in rule Chapter 132 , Learning Results: 
Parameters for Essential Instruction , which were last revised and adopted in 2022 , include 
standards in the following standards strands: Health Concepts; Health Information, Products, and 
Services; Health  Promotion and Risk Reduction; Influences on Health, Communication and 
Advocacy Skills; Decision -Making and Goal -Setting Skills. Within each of these st andards  are 
examples of lear ning outcomes to be used to guide curriculum and program implementation. 
Skills and understandings related to traffic safety fit appropriately within multiple of the Health 
Education and P hysical Education  Learning Results strands.  For example:  
 
Standard HE 3 Health Promotion and Risk Reduction: Health literate students demonstrate the 
ability to practice health -enhancing behaviors and avoid or reduce health risks for self and 
others.  
3.1 Grade 2 Health -Enhancing Behaviors and Self -Management:  
Students app ly health -enhancing behaviors to improve personal health 
including self -management skills.  
3.2 Grade 5 Avoiding/Reducing Health Risks : 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 03D66D91-4B25-4B49-9832-67290B49A3AB
Students demonstrate a variety of behaviors to help avoid or reduce health 
risks to self and others.  
 
Previous iterations  of this bill have be en included in the 128th and 129th Legislative sessions. In 
both cases, the bills proposed to cover  90% of the cost to school administrative units to 
implement and annually provide age -appropriate traffic safety education to students i n at least 4 
different grade levels between grade 4 and grade 8 (12). In each of these cases, the bill died on 
adjournment.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 730 and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
