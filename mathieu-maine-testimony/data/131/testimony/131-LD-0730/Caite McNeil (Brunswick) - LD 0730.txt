Dear Legislators, 
Thank you for considering a mandatory education for all young Mainers on traffic safety. 
As we consider a future that is less dependent on fossil fuels, it's important that our young 
people feel safe and empowered to walk or bike in their neighborhoods, cities and towns. If 
bike and pedestrian safety is a mandated part of every Maine student's education, they will go
onto our streets, our sidewalks, our bike lanes with a proper understanding of safety. Not only
that, every new driver who has gone through Maine's traffic safety program will understand 
the rules of the road as well. It's not only bikers and walkers who need to understand the 
rules, it's drivers too, and here is a way to ensure that our young people are looking out for 
each other on the roads. 
Thanks for your time and consideration. 
Best, 
Caite McNeil
