Testimony of Debra McIntyre, Executive Director, on behalf of the members of the Maine 
Curriculum Leaders Association, testifying in opposition to LD 730 An Act to Require 
Traffic Safety Education in Schools. 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, my name is Debra McIntyre, and I am the Executive Director of the Maine 
Curriculum Leaders Association. On behalf of the members of MCLA, I offer testimony in 
opposition to LD 730 An Act to Require Traffic Safety Education in Schools. 
While the intent of LD 730 is one of safety for children and the public, it puts an undue burden 
on school districts.  While there are some school districts that provide specific grade levels with 
safety training, these schools primarily work with an outside community organization to 
implement a bicycle safety program.  MCLA believes that an annual requirement for all ages 
and grades to implement traffic safety education is yet one more mandate.  We also believe that 
a legislative mandate is not the appropriate route for content inclusion in local curricula, as 
these decisions belong to local districts.  We believe that the skills and concepts in this bill 
should be taught at home and/or in conjunction with local community organizations within the 
community setting. Furthermore, not all students have access to a “micro mobility device”.  For 
these reasons MCLA is in opposition to LD 730.  
Thank you for your time.
