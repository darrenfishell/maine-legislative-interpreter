Land for Maine’s Future Program  
April 10, 2023  
  
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker , and members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation, and Forestry, the Island Institute is  offering this testimony in support of LD 1285.  
 
The Island Institute ’s work focuses on building economic, climate and community resilience in 
support of Main e’s island and coastal communities. We work with communities where 1 in 5 
residents hold a lobster license, and where a ccess to a robust working waterfront  is critical t o the 
survival of businesses  and to the economic wellbeing of families . Maine’s working waterfront is 
under threat, with only 20 -miles remaining along 3,500 miles of coastline.  Land for Maine’s 
Future ’s Working Waterfron t Access Protection Program (WWAPP) is an important tool for 
providing long -term protection of  working waterfront  properties . While the program currently  
has funds, the lack of consistent funding for the last 10 years and a heavy reliance on bond funds 
makes it harder for working waterfront businesses to understand the program, whether it might 
be good fit for them and plan for their options . 
 
We support moving LD 1285 forward to ensure a  consistent source of funding for LMF , along 
with a commitment to fund WWAPP , to help  secure the future of working waterf ront 
infrastructure and Maine’s marine economy .
