MEJ Testimony in Support of LD 430, An Act to Provide Translation Services for Hospital Patients 
l\/larch 17, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee. My name is Dina l\/lalual, I use she/her pronouns, and I'm a Policy Advocate 
with Maine Equal Justice, a nonproﬁt legal aid provider working to increase economic security, 
opportunity, and equity for people in Maine. l am testifying in support of LD 430. 
This bill both addresses l\/laine ’s changing population and provides a solution to the challenge of 
language access. As an active member of immigrant-led organizations, lVlaine Equal Justice daily 
sees the challenges of resettling immigrant families as a result of inadequate resources. These 
challenges are worsened due to limited language access. As an organization we stand for equity 
and believe LD 430 is a step in the right direction. 
As a former refugee, I know from ﬁrsthand experience what it's like to translate and interpret 
for relatives. The burden often falls on children who may not entirely understand medical 
jargon. This bill removes the responsibility from relatives and requires that the institution 
adequately meet their patients ’ communication needs. 
In 2018, foreign-born individuals made up 4% of Maine's populationl . As numbers continue to 
rise, so should access. By reducing language barriers, we reduce health disparities and empower 
individuals to utilize medical resources to prioritize their health. With many displaced or 
without shelter during l\/laine's harsh winters, ongoing health challenges from COVID-19 and the 
ﬂu, plus all the other potential injuries or health issues Maine people experience every day, 
people with language needs are going to need medical care at our hospitals and adequate 
interpretation is needed to navigate the decisions and challenges that go along with that care.

Language barriers directly affect the quality of care patients receive. For people who speak 
languages other than English, this may impact adherence to medication, understanding 
treatment plans, and overall patient satisfactionz . The lack ofsupport is also an added burden 
on health care workers who may provide an improper diagnosis or another medical error due to 
the lack of understanding - which can be both dangerous and costly. Excellent quality of care is 
dependent on strong communication between patients and health care providers. 
To strengthen this bill, we recommend including an opt-out option for patients and broadening 
terminology within this bill. With an option to utilize an appointed interpreter or translator, we 
are empowering patients. The option creates a space where patients can self-advocate. in 
addition, we ask that you consider adding language to the bill to be inclusive of both translators 
and interpreters, with the former converting written language from one language to another 
and the latter converting spoken words from one language to another. Both are needed to 
promote quality communication. 
Medical interpreters and translators repair the communication gap between patients and 
providers? By utilizing this resource we are putting the patient's health and wellbeing ﬁrst. For 
these reasons, we urge you to support LD 430. We also suggest adopting an opt-out option to 
empower patients. People who speak languages other than English should always be able to 
access professional interpreters provided by the hospital, or choose an identiﬁed adult to 
interpret if they prefer. 
Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts with you today. l can be available at your 
work session and l'm happy to answer any questions.
