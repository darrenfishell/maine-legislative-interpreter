TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE ON HOUSING 
NFNA on LD 1752 
Resolve, to Prepare Preapproved Building Types 
May 9, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing, 
my name is Judy East, and I am the Director of the Bureau of Resource Information and Land 
Use Planning (BRILUP). I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry (DACF) neither for nor against LD 1752, Resolve, to Prepare 
Preapproved Building Types. 
This bill directs BRILUP to contract with a consultant to establish a set of building types that 
municipalities may adopt as preapproved building types to reduce the cost and time associated 
with processing building permit applications. BRILUP must report back on its efforts to this 
committee no later than November 6, 2024. This committee may report out legislation relating to 
the subject matter of the report to the l32“d Legislature in 2025. 
DACF favors establishing mechanisms to promote affordable housing. Identifying building types 
with strong visual depictions and extensive public input will help to reduce the time and 
uncertainty associated with obtaining development review approval. Time and uncertainty are 
among the most critical factors affecting the decision to move forward on development projects. 
We know of several pending legislative initiatives to provide pre-approval, ﬁnancing, or special 
incentives for various housing types. Other pending legislative initiatives reference preapproved 
building types. It will be essential to identify procedures for how municipalities can “opt-in” and 
adopt preapproved buildings and the extent that existing municipal standards apply to them. 
BRILUP at DACF, in coordination with the Governor ’s Ofﬁce of Policy Innovation and the 
Future (GOPIF), is very interested in working with the sponsor and interested parties to move 
forward on these issues. 
Thank you for your time. I would happily answer any questions now or at the work session.
