I have great concern over the administrative burden of checking the status of 
numerous buildings for pre-approval compliance in 500+ towns/cities for dozens of 
"pre-approved" residential buildings for every single ordinance adopted locally that 
could affect their building codes.
This might be better overseen by a community non-profit with support from the 
construction industry rather than burdening any one state department with the need 
for constant alterations. Even MMA would be a better manager of the need for 
oversight in a rapidly changing green environment.
It is especially noteworthy that most lumber companies have brochures for standard 
house plans. And there are books upon books of architectural drawings that 
consumers draw from.Imagine if every month the featured house in Better Homes & 
Gardens wias brought to a town, state or other entity by dozens of people with the 
question "Is this pre-approved?" I think too much human capital would be required to 
oversee this. I would hate to see many towns create new jobs just to keep current 
since the list of pre-approved homes would not be stagnant.
