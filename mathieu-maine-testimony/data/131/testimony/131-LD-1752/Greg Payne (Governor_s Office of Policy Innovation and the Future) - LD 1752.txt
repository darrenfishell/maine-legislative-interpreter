Testimony Neither For, Nor Against 
L.D. 1752, Resolve, to Prepare Preapproved Building Types 
 
May 09, 2023 
 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere and distinguished members of the Joint Select 
Committee on Housing, my name is Greg Payne and I am the Senior Advisor on 
Housing in the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future. I am here today to 
offer testimony neither for, nor against L.D. 1752, Resolve, to Prepare 
Preapproved Building Types. 
 
Applying innovative and forward-thinking solutions to Maine’s housing crunch is 
critical to alleviating the challenges faced by Mainers. The concept of establishing a 
library of preapproved building types that would be easily accessible to the public has 
merit. In fact, we know of examples across the country that have adopted such an 
approach, particularly for accessory dwelling units (ADUs). A few examples include: 
 
• The city of San Jose in California: 
https://www.sanjoseca.gov/business/development-services-permit-
center/accessory-dwelling-units-adus/preapproved-adus  
• The city of Eugene in Oregon: https://www.eugene-or.gov/4707/Pre-Approved-
Accessory-Dwelling-Unit-Pro  
• The city of Fremont in California: 
https://www.fremont.gov/government/departments/community-
development/planning-building-permit-services/accessory-dwelling-units-
adus/preapproved-accessory-dwelling-units-adus  
• The city of Bend in Oregon: 
https://www.bendoregon.gov/government/departments/community-
development/online-permit-center/pre-approved-accessory-dwelling-units  
 
By making the process to build an ADU more accessible to the public, California has 
seen a significant increase in permits issued for ADUs. In 2013, only 799 permits were 
issued for ADUs according to the California Department of Housing and Community 
Development. The permits issued jumped in 2017 and climbed to 15,067 in 2022. 
Adopting preapproved designs is likely one of several factors contributing to this 
significant increase.  
 
We would be happy to convene stakeholders and interested parties to explore the best 
approaches to promoting preapproved designs. By looking at this more closely, we 
believe there is likely a great opportunity for the committee to act on this concept soon. 
Thanks for your consideration and I am happy to answer any questions you might have.
