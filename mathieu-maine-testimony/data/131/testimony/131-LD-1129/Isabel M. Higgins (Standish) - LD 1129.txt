Isabel M. Higgins
Standish
LD 1129
To the esteemed chair and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee:
my name is Isabel Higgins and I am a resident of Standish.  I am horrified by the 
depth of hubris and  distrust  it took for the author to pen LD 1129.  This bill puts an 
untenable  onus on the entire public education system which is currently hard pressed 
to fully staff schools to meet the many needs of students.  It calls for such minute  and
specific detail of curriculum and school activities to be provided  , records and videos 
made and stored for specific periods of time, so as to make the job of educating 
students a secondary concern to meeting the personal needs of parents.  It will take 
away the already thinly stretched time of teachers, staff and support personnel while 
decreasing  their time with direct student education and related classroom activities. 
To call it overreach is polite. There are already procedures in place to review 
curriculum content, which is the responsibility of the concerned parent  to review, 
followed by open discussion with teachers and administration to work out any issues. 
I would heartily recommend an "ought not to pass" vote on this proposed legislation . 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
