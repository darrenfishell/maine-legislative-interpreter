I am writing as a classroom teacher of over sixteen years and a member of the 
Executive Board of the Maine Council for English Language Arts. 
We have all watched in dismay as public education has become vilified by certain 
members of the public. Those fringe elements call us "groomers" and falsely claim 
that we are indoctrinating America's youth. I wish I had the power to indoctrinate my 
students but my own, and most teachers, would have different priorities. First, I would
indoctrinate them into capitalizing proper nouns. They would be indoctrinated into 
putting their names on their papers and meeting deadlines. 
Our detractors want to tear down public education by putting us in a stranglehold and 
negating local control of education. Many do so, wielding religious arguments â€” 
arguments our Constitution forbids as a litmus test for legislation. 
Test them. When they complain about Critical Race Theory, can they explain it? No. 
When they seek to ban social-emotional learning, can they describe it? Again, no. 
When they demand a book be taken from a library, did they read it? We know the 
answer. We simply cannot ignore educators in favor of legislating from complete 
ignorance and fear-mongering from a minority of right-wing talking heads. 
These people and groups like Moms for Liberty, are on a mission to throw as much 
right-biased legislation against the wall in hopes that something sticks. I would also 
point out that the language of LD 1589 also would exclude reciting the pledge or the 
playing of the national anthem as it indoctrinates children from a particular political 
viewpoint. 
If this were regarding medical care, I would like to think that the state would take the 
advice of the medical community. Do not make the mistake of polling the uneducated 
and willfully ignorant over those dedicated to learning.
