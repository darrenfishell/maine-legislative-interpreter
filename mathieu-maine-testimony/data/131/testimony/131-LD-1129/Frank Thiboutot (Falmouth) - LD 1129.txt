LD 1129
In years past, I felt comfortable sending my child to public schools here in Maine. 
However, that is no longer the case with the future education of my grandchild. 
I still believe many teachers have the students' best interest in mind, but others do not.
Some have no problem with subordinating the wishes of the taxpaying parents to that 
of the government and teacher unions. In many instances with agenda driven curricula
in the classrooms, they are indoctrinating rather than actually preparing students to 
think critically as future productive and solid citizens.  
Educators who claim that they know what's best for their students is a specious 
agrument at best which borders on an outright lie to put it mildly. There should be no 
roadblocks, hurdles or speed bumps to a parent who wants to know exactly what his 
or her child is being taught. That was and always should be their right as free 
Americans.
Therefore, I am urging you to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 1129. 
Thank you for your consideration.
