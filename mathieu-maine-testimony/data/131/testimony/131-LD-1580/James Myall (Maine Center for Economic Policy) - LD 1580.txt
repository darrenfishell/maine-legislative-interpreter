Testimony in opposition to LD 1580  “An Act to Help Maine Small Businesses with Increasing Costs by Removing the 
Annual Cost -of-living Adjustment for the Minimum Wage ” 
James Myall, Economic Policy Analyst  
April 20, 2023  
 
Dear Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing. My name is 
James Myall. I’m an Economic Policy Analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Policy . I’m writing to ex press ME CEP’s 
opposition to LD 1580  “An Act to Help Maine Small Businesses with Increasing Costs by Removing the Annual Cost -of-
living Adjustment for the Minimum Wage .” 
 
Since L D 1580 would have the same effect as an earlier bill hea rd by this committee , LD 998 , I will keep m y comments 
brief, and refer you to my test imony in opposition to that bill. 
 
Indexi ng Maine ’s minimum wage to inflation is essential to ensure that the minimum  wage keep pace with increases in 
the cost of livin g, and t o ensure that low -wage workers in M aine don ’t find themsel ves fall ing further  behind. The current 
indexing provision  was approved by voters in 2016 and has been repeatedly af firmed by th e legislature. As I wrote in my 
testimony oppos ing LD 998 , ending the indexing provision would  mean a loss of income of up to $48,000 over the next 
ten years for a minimum -wage worker in Maine.  
 
Thank you considering my testimony . As always , I am happy to answer any questions, and can be reached at
