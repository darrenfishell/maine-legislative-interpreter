LD 1580
Dear Labor and Housing Committee, 
My name is Megan, and I live in China, Maine. I am writing today to ask you to 
support/oppose LD 1580.
As a worker and a human being, I am tired of being taken advantage of. Work is 
work. And the inflation that is still happening is due to corporate greed, which 
employees should not have to be penalized for. This bill doesn't solve the problem. It 
makes it worse. There are more people in the world than businesses and we need to 
start taking care of ourselves again. We need livable wages to afford food, and water, 
and maintain our housing.  
This is why I ask you to oppose LD 1580
Thank you for your time.
