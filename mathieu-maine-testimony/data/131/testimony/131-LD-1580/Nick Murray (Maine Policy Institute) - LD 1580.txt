Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1580:
“An
Act
to
Help
Maine
Small
Businesses
with
Increasing
Costs
by
Removing
the
Annual
Cost-of-living
Adjustment
for
the
Minimum
Wage”
Senator
Tipping,
Representative
Roeder,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1580.
According
to
the
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics,
in
2021,
only
1.3%
of
Maine
workers
were
paid
at
hourly
rates
at
or
below
the
minimum
wage.
1
When
wages
rise
artificially
due
to
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage,
even
a
small
one
due
to
the
rise
in
CPI,
payroll
costs
on
businesses
increase
without
compensation
for
growth
in
productivity
or
sales.
With
a
majority
of
businesses
operating
on
razor-thin
profit
margins,
Maine’s
minimum
wage
increases
give
many
small
businesses
no
choice
but
to
reduce
their
operations,
raise
prices,
lay
off
workers,
transition
to
automation,
or
relocate
to
another
state.
Perhaps
counterintuitively,
repealing
the
minimum
wage,
or
at
least
halting
its
incessant
climb,
would
bring
greater
benefits
to
workers.
Data
bear
this
out.
A
study
published
in
American
Economic
Journal
studied
the
effects
after
Seattle
set
its
citywide
minimum
wage
to
$13/hour
in
2017.
It
found
that
those
earning
less
than
$19/hour
saw
their
wages
rise
by
3.4%,
but
their
working
hours
decreased
by
7%.
The
low-wage
workers
who
were
employed
in
Washington
before
the
policy
went
into
effect
saw
their
wages
rise
more
than
their
hours
fell,
but
made
only
about
$12
more
per
week
on
average.
Researchers
found
a
lower
rate
of
hiring
for
the
low-wage
workers
who
were
not
previously
employed
in
the
state
before
the
new
citywide
minimum
wage.
2
Ultimately,
workers
lost
from
this
experiment.
A
study
published
in
the
American
Journal
of
Health
Economics
in
May
2021
found
that
“minimum
wage
increases
lead
to
reductions
in
employer
sponsored
insurance
coverage
in
families
below
300%
of
the
federal
poverty
level.”
Researchers
found
that
for
every
nominal
$1
increase
in
the
minimum
wage,
the
probability
of
employer
sponsored
insurance
coverage
is
reduced
by
about
1
percentage
point.

Minimum
wage
Proponents’
oft-stated
goal,
a
national,
$15/hour
minimum
wage
(though
now
they
want
$20/hour,
given
record
inflation
4
),
would
be
disastrous
for
our
nation’s
economy.
An
analysis
published
by
the
nonprofit
Employment
Policies
Institute
(EPI),
based
on
a
2019
CBO
report,
found
that
a
$15/hour
minimum
wage
would
lead
to
2
million
jobs
lost
and
collectively
cost
businesses
over
$99
billion.
EPI
also
found
that
the
job
losses
would
hit
the
youngest
workers
(age
16-19)
the
hardest,
with
that
group
projected
to
lose
more
than
850,000
jobs.
In
Maine,
they
estimated
the
policy
would
cost
1,300
jobs
and
$90
million
in
increased
business
costs.
5
As
its
title
states,
a
fantastic
way
for
legislators
to
help
businesses
with
increasing
costs
would
be
to
remove
the
legal
restrictions
that
force
them
to
raise
their
costs.
These
include
onerous
bureaucratic
rules,
taxes,
and
the
minimum
wage.
Please
deem
LD
1580
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
provide
Maine’s
struggling
small
businesses
with
some
measure
of
relief
against
skyrocketing
costs
of
doing
business.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
