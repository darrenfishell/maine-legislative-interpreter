In Support Of 
 
LD 1580, An Act to Help  Maine  Small  Businesses  with Increasing  Costs  by Removing  the Annual  
Cost-of-living  Adjustment  for the Minimum  Wage  
 
 
April 20, 2023 
 
Senator  Tipping, Representative  Roeder, and Members  of the Joint  Standing  Committee  on Labor  and Housing:  
 
My name  is Alison  Sucy  and I am the Chief  Operating  Officer  and Director  of Government  Affairs  for the 
Maine  Tourism  Association.  The Maine  Tourism  Association  is the state’s  largest  tourism  organization  with 
1500  members  in every  type of tourism  business  such  as lodging,  restaurants,  campgrounds,  retail,  guides,  
outdoor  recreation,  amusements,  and historical  and cultural  attractions.  We’ve  been  promoting  Maine  and our 
members  for over 100 years.  I present  this testimony  in support  of LD 1580.  
 
The increases in the minimum wage that took place over the past several years and continue to grow with annual 
indexing pose a significant challenge to many of our members. Many of our smaller members are struggling under 
increased wages, benefits, supply costs, and other costs of doing business; and rather than expand or reinvest in 
their businesses, they may hire fewer workers or provide fewer work hours for employees just to be able to remain 
operational. 
 
Tourism has a broad mix of entry-level jobs through highly-skilled, management, and entrepreneurial career 
opportunities. In some areas of the state, even entry-level tourism jobs are paid well above the minimum wage. 
However, while the cost-of-living adjustment may not seem significant, the annual incremental raising of the 
starting wage increases all other wages. Combined with all other cost increases, this presents a real hardship for our 
small businesses, many of which operate on very thin margins. 
 
Tourism was one of the hardest hit industries during the pandemic. Maine’s tourism businesses are starting the slow 
process of recovery. Predictions are that it will be at least 2024 before the industry returns to pre-pandemic levels. 
Maine’s economy is dependent on a successful tourism industry. According to the Maine Office of Tourism, 2022 
numbers indicate that: 
 
•   Direct tourism expenditures totaled $8.6 billion 
•   Without tourism, Maine households would have had to pay an additional $2,172 in state and local taxes 
•   Tourism supported 151,000 Maine jobs 
 
Maine needs tourism to be successful, not just for the 151,000 people in its jobs and the direct economic impact but 
also for the indirect impact. Tourism businesses utilize contractors, landscapers, plumbers, and electricians; and 
they buy from our farms, fisheries, wineries, and breweries. If tourism businesses can’t succeed, these other 
businesses suffer as well. We want the tourism industry to continue to recover and grow and provide tens of 
thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to the Maine economy. Therefore, I respectfully request that you support 
LD 1580. Thank you for your consideration.
