Testimony in Opposition to LD  855, “An Act to Provide That the Minimum Wage Increases by the Rolling Average of 
the Cost of Living of the Previous 3 Years ” and LD 998 , “An Act to Remove the Cost -of-living Adjustment from the 
Minimum Wage Laws ” 
James Myall,  Economic Policy Analyst  
March 30, 2023  
 
Good Af ternoon Senator Tippin g, Represen tative Roeder, and members  of the Joint Standing Committee  on Labor and 
Housi ng. My name is James Myall. I ’m an E conomic Policy Analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Polic y. I’m her e to 
testify in opposition to LDs 855 and  998. Both bills would undermine the economic  security of Mainers by eroding the 
value of the state’s minimum wage law over time.  
When Maine voters appro ved the sta te’s minimum  wage law in 2016 , they  also approve d the provisions  indexing the 
minimum wage to inflation. This part of the law is important  because the minimum wage is intended to allow all 
Mainers to earn a wage that provides a basic level of d ignity and allows a basic standard of living . Weakeni ng or 
eliminating that piece of law means that the minimum wage will not keep pace with  the cost of living sufficiently,  and 
will reduce l iving standards for the lowest -paid Ma iners o ver time.  
We have seen the importan ce of indexing over the past two years , when we have seen costs of necessi ties like rent, 
groc eries, and heating oil ri se precip itously for Mainers. E ven with the increased m inimum wage, man y Mainers are 
strugg ling to absorb the se extra costs. At the same time, some bu sines ses are finding that they need to pay workers 
high er wages in o rder to attract and retain employees. This is not the time to be lowering the minimum wage.  
Of the two bills before you, LD 988 is the most harmful to workers. It would end indexing entirely and keep the 
minimum  wage at its current rate of $1 3.80 per hour.  As I’ve already mentione d, we have a very recent example of 
period of high inflation. If t he minimum wage had remained at $12 per ho ur in 2020 and not b een in dexed , as LD 988 
propose s, the lowest -paid full-time workers today would be earning $ 3,744 less per year. That ’s a signi ficant amount for 
any low -income family.  But even in a period of more normal inflat ion, LD 988 would harm workers. Using estimat es from 
the Congressional Budget Office, I estimate that under the current law, the state’s minimum wage will reach $17.80 pe r 
hour by 20 33. If LD 988 is passed, that  number will be reduce d by $4 pe r hour, or over $8,000 per year for a full -time 
worker. In fact , over the next decade, a f ull-time minimum w age worker would lose $48,000 dollars in lost wages  (see 
table  1). 
LD 855 is les s directly  harmful to worker s. By calculating  the minimum wage ’s cost-of-living in crease over a period of 
three years,  wages wo uld increase more slowly w hen inflation is rising , and more quickly in peri ods where inflation is 
falling . To some extent , those  trends would balance each other out.  However, it would disconnect  the minimum  wage 
from the rea lity faced by  workers. Telling someone their wage s will eventually catch up with inflation is no co mfort 
when the price s they are paying at the grocery store or the gas pump ar e increasing immediately.  In years where 
inflation is trending  upwards, LD 8 55 w ould create a pay cut for minimum  wage workers relat ive to the current law. For 
example, if LD 855  were currently the law, minimum -wage workers in M aine would have gotten a n increase of less than 
2.5 percent  in a year when  costs rose more than 8 percent , and the mini mum wage today would have been $ 13.10, 
rather than $1 3.80 an hour. That ’s a difference of $1,500 a year for a full -time worker  (see table 2).  
I will note t hat if inflation continues to trend downward s over the next few ye ars, LD 855 as written would actually 
create a larger minimum wage increase in 2026 than under current law. However, we still oppose the legislation  for the 
reasons outlined above. The minimum wage should reflect the current reali ty for Maine ’s low -wage workers.  
I urge you to vote “ought not to pass ” on LDs 8 55 and 988. I ’m happy to answer any questions .

Notes: Inflation estimates  for 202 4 onwards follow the Congressional Budget O ffice’s estimates for the Consumer Price Index for Urban C onsumers as published  
in their Feb 15, 2023 Budget and Economic O utlook. Note that Maine ’s minimum wage l aw use s a slightly dif ferent metric – the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and 
Clerical Workers (CPI -W) for the Northeast region.  However, no projects for this metric were available . Annual lost wages assumes that a minimum -wage  worker 
is working 2 ,080 hours per year.
