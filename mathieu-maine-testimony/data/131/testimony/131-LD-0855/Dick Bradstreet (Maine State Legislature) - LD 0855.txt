RE: LD 855 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and fellow members of the Joint Committee on 
Labor and Housing, l'm Representative Dick Bradstreet of House District 61, which is comprised 
of my home town of Vassalboro and most of Sidney. l’m here today to present LD 855, An Act 
to Provide that the Minimum Wage Increases by the Rolling Average of the Cost of Living of the 
Previous Three Years. 
Currently Maine's minimum wage adjusts each January 1 by the percentage increase, if 
any, as of August ofthe previous year over the level as of August of the year preceding that 
year in the Consumer Price lndex for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPl-W, for the 
Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the United States Department of 
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount of the minimum 
wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of $.05. This bill would provide that the 
minimum wage increases by the average increase, if any, in the cost of living over the three 
previous calendar years, commencing January 1, 2026. So nothing will change from the status 
quo until January 1, 2026, whereupon the new minimum wage will increase based on the 
average increase in the cost of living for 2023, 2024 and 2025, still using August of each year as 
the time for determining the cost of living increases. On January 1, 2027, the increase will be 
based on the numbers for 2024, 2025 and 2026, and so on. 
This is my reasoning behind this. In our current situation, the minimum wage increase 
may be very large in some years and quite minimal in other years, depending on the inflation 
rate. This can make it very difficult for smaller businesses to make quite extreme adjustments 
in what they will pay for many workers - not just those earning minimum wage, but for all 
workers especially when pay ranges are based on the minimum wage. This can also put 
workers in jeopardy, as it will often become difficult for businesses to retain workers when 
faced with large cost increases in one fell swoop, and as we know, workers are often worried

the security of their LD 855 simply seeks to "flatten the__curve" if you will, of wage 
acljiustments so that they are not as extreme in any one year. ln some years, wage increases 
not be as large as the preyious year's COLA would now require, while in other years they 
will act‘ »£i*a‘lly be more. This will add the-benefits of stabili"dy1an ‘d more ‘jssr‘eclictabi|ity for 'b'oth<"
