Re:  LD 1178 â€“ Resolve, to Reduce Barriers to Recovery from Addiction by Expanding Eligibility 
for Targeted Case Management Services  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on LD 1178, Resolve, to Reduce Barriers to 
Recovery from Addiction by Expanding Eligibility for Targeted Case Management Services . This 
resolve directs the Department of Health and Human Services to  amend its rule Chapter 101: 
MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter II, Section 13.03 -4 to remove from the eligibility 
requirements for targeted case management services for adults with substance use disorder the 
provision regarding pregnancy, living with mino r children and intravenous drug use.  
 
We do not believe this is necessary as P.L. 2021, Ch. 635, Part JJJ directed the Department to 
expand the opioid health home model to serve all MaineCare members with any Substance Use 
Disorder  (SUD) . As such, t he Depa rtment opposes building out a duplicative model of care that 
would create inefficiency and confusion  for MaineCare provider s and member s.  
 
The Department is focusing resources on expanding its SUD health homes model and team -based 
approach to care. The Department has engaged many stakeholders in the development of the 
forthcoming SUD health homes model and recommends continuing with the current plan in 
accordance with provisions set forth in P. L. 2021, Ch. 635, Part JJJ.  
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director  
MaineCare Services
