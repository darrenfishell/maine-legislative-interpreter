Judicial Branch testimony in favor of LD 264, An Act to Clarify the Process 
for Admission to the Bar on Motion: 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Cormnittee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
some brief testimony in support of this bill. 
LD 264 amends Title 4, section 805-A, “Qualifications for admission to practice ” law. 
The purpose of this bill is to align the statute with current practice and rules in this area. 
There are currently two ways to be admitted to practice law in Maine: (1) by passing the 
bar examination in Maine; and (2) by ﬁling a motion for admission after having been admitted to 
practice in another state. The current statute only provides for the ﬁrst method. 
LD 264, in section 2, adds a subsection 4 to the statute that clariﬁes that applicants for the 
bar by admission on motion also must be admitted to practice within one year. The one year 
begins to run after the board of bar examiners receives the application. 
I would be happy to answer any questions.
