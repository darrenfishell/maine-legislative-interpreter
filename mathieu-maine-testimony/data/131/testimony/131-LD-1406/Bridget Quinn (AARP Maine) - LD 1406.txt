Testimony in  Support of LD 1406 : An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding Estate 
Recovery and Planning for Long -Term Care  
 
 
Greetings , Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services . I am Bridget Quinn, Associate State Director of Advocacy and 
Outreach for AARP Maine.  
 
AARP is the nation’s largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedi cated to empowering 
Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our nearly 
200,000 members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony. Today, I am 
testifying for LD 1406.  
 
According to AARP ’s Valuing the Inval uable 2023 Update: Strengthening Supports for Family 
Caregivers  report, Maine is home to nearly 166,000 unpaid family caregivers. The unpaid 
care provided by these family  caregivers in Maine is valued at $2.9 billion . The report 
highlights the growing scop e and complexity of family caregiving and recommends  actions 
needed to address the many challenges of caring for parents, spouses, and other loved 
ones.1 Another study from AARP , Caregiving Out -of-Pocket Costs Study , reported that  the 
average annual amount family c aregivers spend on caregiving is $7,242.  The study 
demonstrates the importance of supporting family caregivers with not only resources and 
education but financial assistance as well.  
 
Caring for a loved one can be expensive, stressful, and isolating. Family caregivers often put 
their own health and well -being second, third or fourth. They do this while providing 
critical support to their loved ones , allowing them to remain at home and independent in 
their communities. LD 1406 recognizes the importance of Maine’s family caregivers and 
works to support them.  
 
Specifically, LD 1406 will help educate Mainers on their options for providing care to loved 
ones. The bill will direct the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to create 
materials that educate caregivers on their options to be reimbursed for supporting loved

ones who are eligible for home and community -based services  (HCBS) . At AARP Maine we 
have heard from some caregivers who don’t know where to turn to understan d services 
that they are eligible for. Having these resources will enable those caregivers to further 
support their loved ones in their communities.  
 
LD 1406 also directs DHHS to develop educational materials that  assist individuals with 
long -term care planning, estate planning , and asset transferring and sheltering.  It is critical 
caregivers better understand better understand how these areas could potentially affect 
them . Although the look -back is intended to prevent people from sheltering assets in order 
to qualify for Medicaid inappropriately, many transfers deemed inappropriate have been  
made  innocently  by families  before they realized the  need for long -term support  was 
apparent.  
 
LD 1406 will assist Maine’s  166,000 unpaid family caregiver s who are providing critical 
support throughout  our state. We urge this committee to vote in favor of LD 1406. If you 
have question s for me , I can be reached at bquinn@aarp.org  . Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today.
