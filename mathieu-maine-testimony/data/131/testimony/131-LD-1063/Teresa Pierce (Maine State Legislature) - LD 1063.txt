Testimony of Senator Teresa S. Pierce introducing 
LD 1063, An Act to Provide Equitable Tax Treatment to State-licensed 
Cannabis Businesses 
before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
March 30, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and Esteemed Members of the Taxation Committee, my 
name is Teresa Pierce, and I represent Senate District 25, encompassing Falmouth, Cumberland, 
North Yarmouth, Yarmouth (majority), Gray, and Long Island. Today I am pleased to introduce LD 
1063, An Act to Provide Equitable Tax Treatment to State-licensed Cannabis Businesses. 
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January l, 2023, adds manufacturing facilities, 
cannabis establishments and testing facilities to the list of cannabis businesses licensed by the State 
that are eligible to take deductions under the state income tax laws. 
Section 280E of the federal tax code prohibits trades or businesses trafficking in a controlled 
substance from deducting ordinary business expenses. Maine has a similar prohibition in its tax code. 
Cannabis is still considered a controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act, so 
businesses producing, manufacturing, or selling cannabis, even a business deemed legal at the state 
level, cannot deduct ordinary business expenses under the federal or state tax code expressly 
authorizes such a deduction. This legislation would create that express authorization. 
The contrast in the tax code is appalling. The effective tax rate for businesses able to write off 
business expenses is roughly 40% of their gross income. Comparatively, the effective tax rate for 
businesses that are unable to deduct ordinary businesses expenses is approximately 70% of gross 
income. This unfair tax code is signiﬁcant and means a 30% loss for business owners to reinvest in 
their business, hire and retain quality employees, and offer greater beneﬁts to current employees. The 
medical cannabis industry in Maine is able to utilize this tax advantage. It seems only fair and 
prudent that both our cannabis industries could have this opportunity. 
The adult cannabis industry brought nearly $160 million in revenue to the State in 2022.‘ If we cut 
red tape and remove barriers from business growing and expanding, there is potential for this number 
to grow exponentially, bringing more revenue to our state as we continue meeting the challenges 
facing Mainers. 
Thank you for the opportunity to present this bill, I am happy to answer any questions to the best of 
my ability.
