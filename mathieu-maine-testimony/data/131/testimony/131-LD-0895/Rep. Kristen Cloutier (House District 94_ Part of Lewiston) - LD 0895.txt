T estimony
of
Rep.
Kristen
Cloutier
Supporting 
LD
895,
An
Act
to
Establish
Culturally
Informed
Reentry
or 
Reintegration
Halfway
Houses
Before
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety
Good
morning,
Senator
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury
and
esteemed
members
of
the 
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety
Committee.
My
name
is
Kristen
Cloutier ,
and
I
proudly 
represent
House
District
94,
which
includes
part
of
Lewiston.
I
am
submitting
this
written 
testimony
as
a
supportive
cosponsor
of
LD
895,
An
Act
to
Establish
Culturally
Informed 
Reentry
or
Reintegration
Halfway
Houses.
Halfway
houses
provide
transitional
housing
and
treatment
for
individuals
who
are
living
with 
mental
illness
and
substance
use
disorder .
Through
a
structured,
peer -oriented
program,
the
staf f 
at
these
facilities
assist
clients
in
maintaining
recovery
while
moving
from
an
intensive 
rehabilitation
setting
to
increased
independence
and
integration
into
the
community .
These
programs
work
to
address
the
complex
needs
of
clients,
utilizing
an
integrated, 
individualized
and
client-centered
approach,
led
by
staf f
trained
in
trauma-informed
care,
crisis 
intervention
and
mental
health
and
substance
use
treatment.
T o
help
individuals
stabilize
and 
develop
goals
that
will
move
them
toward
the
most
independent,
supportive,
permanent
living 
situation
possible,
staf f
and
clients
work
together
to
develop
individual
care
plans.
However ,
there
is
still
work
to
be
done
to
make
halfway
houses
in
Maine
culturally
sensitive
to 
better
provide
immigrant
families
with
the
security
they
need
to
trust
them
as
a
safe
and
reliable 
place
for
their
children
to
live
and
receive
treatment
on
their
path
to
recovery .
LD
895
would
direct
the
Commissioner
of
Corrections
to
establish
and
operate 
culturally-informed
halfway
houses
for
persons
under
21
years
old
to
provide
housing
services, 
referrals
to
community-based
services
and
supports
and
education
and
employment
resources.
It 
allows
the
commissioner
to
subcontract
with
an
entity
for
the
establishment
and
operation
of
the 
halfway
houses.

Such
a
setting
would
provide
the
support
that
young
people
so
desperately
need
to
make
a 
successful
transition
back
into
society
and
to
reach
their
full
potential
as
active
members
of
our 
communities.
As
a
representative
of
the
second
lar gest
city
in
Maine
with
one
of
the
lar gest 
immigrant
populations
in
the
State,
I
wholeheartedly
support
this
legislation
and
I
hope
you
will, 
too.
Sincerely ,
Rep.
Kristen
