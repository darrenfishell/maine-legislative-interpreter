Re:
L.D.
895,
An
Act
to
Establish
Culturally
Informed
Reentry
or
Reintegration
Halfway 
Houses
Dear
Sen.
Pinny
Beebe-Center,
Rep.
Salisbury
and
members
of
the
Criminal
Justice
& 
Public
Safety
Committee:
I
would
like
to
voice
my
support
for
this
bill.
As
the
mayor
of
Lewiston,
with
one
of
the 
largest
immigrant
populations
in
Maine,
I
believe
this
bill
would
greatly
impact
the
way
we 
care
for
and
support
our
youth.
Halfway
houses
provide
a
much-needed
alternative
to
imprisonment,
connect
our
youth 
in
need
with
crucial
community
services,
and
provide
a
much
more
successful
transition 
back
into
society.
What
our
current
system
is
lacking
are
culturally-appropriate 
approaches
that
will
much
better
serve
our
immigrant
population
and
help
to
reduce 
community
stigma.
This
bill
will
create
spaces
for
our
youth
that
will
help
build
them
up,
not
tear
them
down.
I
appreciate
Senator
Margaret
Rotundo
for
sponsoring
this
bill
and
the
committeeâ€™s
time.
Sincerely,
Carl
L.
Sheline
