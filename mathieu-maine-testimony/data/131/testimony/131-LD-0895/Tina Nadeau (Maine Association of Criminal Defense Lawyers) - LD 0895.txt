Box 17642 Portland, ME 04112-8642 (207) 523-9869      mainemacdl@gmail.com  April 10, 2023   Senator Pinny Beebe-Center, Chair Representative Suzanne Salisbury, Chair Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety 100 State House Station, Room 436 Augusta, ME 04333   RE: LD 895: An Act to Establish Culturally Informed Reentry or Reintegration Halfway Houses   Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and Members of the Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety:  MACDL submits this testimony in support of LD 895: An Act to Establish Culturally Informed Reentry or Reintegration Halfway Houses.  Although we are concerned that these residences would continue to be under the purview of the Department of Corrections—which comes with its own host of issues—we also recognize that young people between the ages of 18 and 21 are vulnerable and lack supportive community-based housing options, options that could help ensure that they remain out of prison as adults.   Having ready access to employment and educational opportunities is also essential in helping young people develop into healthy and thriving adults. Connecting these young people with other community-based services, including providers who can help address any issues with substance use and mental health, is vital.   Imprisonment is not going to improve the lives of our young people: giving them the support they need to succeed outside prison walls will.  One of the most consistent refrains against the closure of Long Creek youth prison is that without the prison, Maine does not have any “good places” for the children we sentence there. Funding and supporting appropriate residences for reentry and reintegration into the community for young people in that terribly important time—ages 18 through 21—could make a world of difference for youth trying to come back into the world healthier and stronger.   We all owe it to them to give them a real fighting chance on the outside.  Thank you for your consideration and your attention to this matter.                    Sincerely,      /s/ Tina Heather Nadeau, Esq.                              MACDL Executive Director
