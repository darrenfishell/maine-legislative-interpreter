Incarcerated people should not be able to claim residency in the municipality they are incarcerated in. 
This puts a completely difficult amount of work on the Clerks in these municipalities. We also will not be 
able to track their timing of release and take them off our registered voter list. Also, there is currently a 
bill where their residency is their previous residency and that should remain the same. We as Clerks 
send out requested absentee ballots for our registered voters even if they are incarcerated in another 
municipality. This keeps our work load and tracking of registered voter’s current. We will be unable to 
keep a clean registered voters list if this bill is passed. I currently deal with a college in our municipality 
which gives me the same type of issues. Students become residence for a short time which is 
understandable if they want to vote and are registering vehicles here and living on campus. However, 
this also makes it very difficult when the student moves off campus and we are not always notified. 
Therefore I have multiple registered voters listed at the college address and no communications as to 
where to find the students in order to remove them from our voting list. This creates a long wait time of 
years before the Secretary of State takes them off my list due to inactivity. The preposed bill will do the 
very same thing. The current bill and system are working so please do not adjust this! I am hoping I am 
not the only Clerk testifying however this bill only effects 3 municipalities I believe but the effects would 
be very time consuming and costly to our municipalities. The people sponsoring this change do not even 
reside in municipalities with incarcerated people so I do not believe would know the effects it will make. 
We are currently set up with a system that works. It does not infringe on anyone’s right to vote or access 
to voting so if it isn’t broke don’t try to fix it.
