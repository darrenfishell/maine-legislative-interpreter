Senator
Ingwersen,
Representative
Pluecker ,
and
other
esteemed
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation,
and
Forestry ,
The
Somali
Bantu
Community
Association
(SBCA)
would
like
to
express
our
support
for
LD
1612
-
An
Act
to
Address
Food
Insecurity
and
Support
Local
Agriculture.
SBCA
believes
that
an
investment
in
the
Preble
Street
Food
Security
Hub
will
ensure
food
security
for
the
thousands
of
people
it
serves
and
support
Somali
Bantu
farmers
through
our
important
partnership.
SBCA ’ s
mission
is
to
provide
vital
transitional
services,
advocacy ,
and
food
production
that
empowers
members
of
the
refugee
community
to
uphold
cultural
identity
and
economic
well-being
to
thrive
in
their
new
life
here
in
Maine.
One
of
our
major
programs
is
Liberation
Farms,
a
community
farming
program
that
provides
new
American
farmers
access
to,
and
culturally-appropriate
resources
for ,
the
means
of
sustainable
food
production
for
themselves,
their
families,
and
their
communities.
This
investment
in
growing
nourishes
body
and
soul
as
farmers
meaningfully
utilize
their
agricultural
roots
as
they
build
new
homes
here
in
Maine.
Liberation
Farms
grows
fresh,
chemical-free
produce
with
a
goal
of
distributing
our
produce
to
low-income
communities.
In
the
summer
of
2022,
Preble
Street
and
Liberation
Farms
joined
forces
to
bring
fresh
produce
to
the
Preble
Street
Food
Security
Hub.
During
this
summer ,
Liberation
Farms
distributed
13,000
pounds
of
tomatoes
to
the
Preble
St
Food
Security
Hub.
Preble
St.
has
provided
a
significant
market
for
Liberation
Farms,
allowing
us
to
continue
producing
at
our
current
scale
and
ensure
financial
stability
for
our
farmers.
Additionally ,
Preble
St.’ s
new
Food
Security
Hub
allows
for
increased
processing
capacity .
Their
dedicated
team
can
develop
lar ge
scale
recipes
for
nearly
2,000
meals
each
day .
Therefore,
they
are
able
to
use
whatever
Liberation
Farms
has
in
abundance,
taking
advantage
of
surplus
items
so
that
our
farmers
can
balance
the
items
they
retain
to
sell
directly
to
consumers
at
farmers
markets
and
for
other
customers.
Liberation
Farms
looks
forward
to
continuing
our
relationship
with
Preble
St.
this
season
and
beyond.
LD
1612
would
support
and
expand
our
impactful
partnership
with
the
Preble
Street
Food
Security
Hub,
improving
the
viability
of
our
food
justice
in
action
model
and
providing
sustainable
livelihoods
for
our
farmers.
