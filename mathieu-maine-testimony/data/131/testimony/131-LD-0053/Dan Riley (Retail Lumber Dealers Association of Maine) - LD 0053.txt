Re: Testimony of the Retail Lumber Dealers Association of Maine in Opposition to LD 53, 
An Act to Ensure Accountability for Workplace Harassment and Assault by Removing 
Intentional Acts and Omissions from Workers’ Compensation Exemptions 
Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Members of the Labor and Housing Committee: 
On behalf of the Retail Lumber Dealers Association of Maine (RLDAM), which represents independent lumber 
and building material dealers, manufacturers, Wholesalers, distributors, and other associated businesses in the 
state of Maine and an industry that employs more than 20,000 Maine residents, We ask you to oppose LD 53. 
Our members agree no one should be harassed or assaulted in the workplace. However, the language this bill 
seeks to add to the Worker’s Compensation (WC) law is vague and the reference to “intentional acts or 
omissions ” could be interpreted to include just about anything. 
An unintentional consequence of this bill could be increased WC costs for all businesses in Maine, not just 
those who have claims brought against them. If the exemption was added to the WC law, it would reverse long 
settled case law, which would drive up rates for all businesses since insurance is a risk pooling tool to spread 
risk and cost across many. 
We have attached a copy of a 2020 federal District Court decision affirming that sex discrimination and sexual 
assault cases, if sufficiently Work-related, fall Within the exclusive remedy provided by the Worker 
Compensation Act.
