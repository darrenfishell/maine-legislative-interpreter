Re: LD 53, An Act to Ensure Accountability for Workplace Harassment and Assault by Removing 
Intentional Acts and Omissions from Workers' Compensation Exemptions
This statement is made on behalf of the thousands of small business owners throughout Maine who are 
members of NFIB.  They collectively provide jobs and paychecks to about 30,000 people and help form 
the economic backbone of their communities and the state.  
We would like to add NFIB to the groups that express concern for the adverse effect LD 53 could have 
on the workers’ compensation system in Maine, as well as the additional costs that may be incurred by 
employers to protect themselves from a new source of potential litigation expense even if the employer 
is not at fault.  Ever since the workers’ compensation system collapsed 30 years ago and was replaced by 
emergency legislation adopted in a special legislative session, Maine has sought to avoid standing out as 
a high cost, high litigation state that gained us an economically damaging national reputation.
Small business owners do not wish to go back to the past; instead, these job creators are focused on the 
future and on being stable or growing sources of economic vitality in their communities.
Thank you for being mindful of how LD 53 might adversely impact small businesses in Maine.
