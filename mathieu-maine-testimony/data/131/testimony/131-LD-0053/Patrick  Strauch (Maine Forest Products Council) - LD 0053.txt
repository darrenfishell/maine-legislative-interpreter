Testimony in Opposition to  LD 53 
 
“An Act to Ensure Accountability for Workplace Harassment and 
Assault by Removing Intentional Acts and Omissions from Workers’ 
Compensation Exemptions ”

Patrick Strauch , Executive  Director  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder  and members of the Committee on Labor and 
Housing, the following is  testimony submitted on behalf of the Maine forest Products 
Council in opposition to LD 53 , “An Act to Ensure Accountability for Workplace 
Harassment and Assault by Removing Intentional Acts and Omissions from Workers’ Compensation Exemptions .”  
 The workers’ c ompensation program works because it strikes a balance between the 
rights and interests of employers and employees. As drafted, LD 53 would upset that balance. Payment of workers ’ compensation benefits to an employee injured at work 
shield the employer from further liability. This bill removes the exemption from lawsuits against employers for injuries to employees  in the workplace that are caused b y 
an intentional act or omission , disrupting the whole purpose of the workers ’ 
compensation system – benefits paid without lawsuits in exchange for protection from further liability.   In addition, the employer may not be at fault for the intentional act or omission, so this bill would open them up to be sued for something that they did not do.  If passed, this bill would open Maine employers of all sizes up to significant , 
unavoidable litigation costs , making Maine a hostile place to do business. For that 
reason, the Council opposes LD 53. W e must keep an equitable, predictable balance 
between employers and workers, or the system simply won’t work. 
 Thank you for your consideration.
