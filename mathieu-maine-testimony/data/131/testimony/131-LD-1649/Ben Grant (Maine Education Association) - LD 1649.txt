April 26, 2023 
My name is Ben Grant (he/him) and l’am proud to serve as General Counsel for the Maine Education 
Association (MEA) The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, including teachers and 
other professionals in nearly every public school in the state, and faculty and other professional staff in 
the University of Maine and Community College Systems 
l wrlte to express the MEA's support for LD 1649 and, conversely, the MEA's opposition to LD 1699 
Our view is that this Committee is charged with finding the correct balance between the competing 
rights at stake here On the one han'd, there is an extreme position — largely now consigned to history- 
that believes the workings of the Government should be kept from the people It is that notion that 
even the Founding Fathers recognized as problematic, leading them to ensure publication of the 
Congressional Record lt is also this notion that led to the passage of FOIA and FOAA in the 20*“ 
Century, as, rightly so, the Government lost the full trust of the people 
V What we are seeing now is louder and louder advocacy by extremists on the other side ofthe issue- 
those who wish the law to grant them a forensic examination of every thought considered by anyone 
who works in public employment Their goal is not to shine light on the workings of government, but 
rather to use social media to weaponize scraps of information in order to threaten, embarrass, and 
intimidate public employees The purpose of FOAA is to allow the public access to the information it 
needs to participate meaningfully in the legitimate political process If you don't like a policy, try to get 
it changed through the electoral and legislative process
( 
However, that IS decidedly not what is confrontmg public employees at present Rather, the law is 
being exploited by those who have failed at the political process, and instead are engaged in a rear- 
guard action to make public employment so unpleasant as to become untenable from the standpoint 
of mental health and public reputation FOAA exists to ensure accountability — not to provide a vocal 
and unscrupulous minority the tools to harass good people out of public life

At a time when hiring people to work in schools is so difficult, and when morale among educators is 
teetering on the brink, it |s t|me for you — the policy makers — to bring some balance back to the law 
LD1649 is an excellent ﬁrst step in correcting the overreach in how FOAA is used today First, it raises 
the fee chargeable to a requestor to align with federal law This may seem like a small change, but 
public employers are literally devoting dozens of hours respond|ng to completely unregulated requests 
Second, |t requires that public employees who are the SUbj8Ct of FOAA requests are notified of the 
request This is vital for many public employees, so that they can be prepared for the onslaught of 
public criticism (or worse) that is likely to ensue Third, this bill establishes an important filter for FOAA 
requests, in the form of Ombudsperson rev|ew In this way, public employers can focus on fulfilling 
legitimate requests, while avoiding those deemed by a neutral party to be frivolous, overly broad, or 
designed to |ntimidate Finally, the bill directs the Ombudsperson to create a common form for use by 
requestors This is important in order to ensure that the public agency has clear direction as to the 
documents being sought These are all good changes that will help bring balance back to the system 
Conversely, LD 1699 will only make a bad situation worse, and encourage an escalation of the same 
actions that are so distasteful now First, it sweeps in thousands of additional organizations and 
employees who are subject to the law, even though these entities are in no other way "public" 
agencies Second, this bill imposes a harsh and lmpractical deadline for responding to FOAA requests 
Public agencies must be allowed to continue conducting their public business - and not have to shut 
down or slow down operations in order to respond to requests Finally, this bill imposes a cap on fees 
that fails to recognize the actual cost to public agencies in staff time, especially schools, required to 
respond to lncreasmgly broad requests 
For all of these reasons, the MEA urges the Committee to support LD 1649 and to oppose LD 1699 
Thank you, and I am happy to try to answer any questions you may have
