Re: Testnnony on LD 1649 
Dear Honorable Senators and Representat1ves, 
I am wntmg th1s testnnony IN FAVOR of An Act to Support Local Governments 1n Respondmg 
to Freedom of Access Act Requests 
I have been a proud publ1c school educator 111 Ma1ne for 27 years I began as an Educat1onal 
Techmclan, then teacher, and then bu1ldmg pr1nc1pal 1n the Mach1as area of Mame I have smce 
spent the past 16 years as a Supermtendent of Schools 1n Mame, ﬁrst servmg School Un1on 60 
and MSAD 12 (Greenv1lle and Jackman area), then RSU 3 (Un1ty/Thomd1ke Area) and most 
recently, servmg the past 8 years as Super1ntendent of Schools 1.11 Gorham, I\/IE 
I have also served 1n many other leadersh1p roles across the state, from presldent of the Mame 
Small Schools Coal1t1on to chalr of MSSA’s Fundmg Commlttee to current member of MSSA’s 
execut1ve commlttee as well as AASA’s (Nat1onal Supermtendent ’s Assoc1at1on)execut1ve L 
commlttee I have also volunteered my t1me as the cha1r of the board for Good W111 H1nckley, as 
a member of USM’s School of Educatlon and Human Development Advlsory Comm1ttee and 
have served on the JMG Board of D1rectors for 9 years 
I do not share these expenences to brag I share them to demonstrate my record of se1v1ce to the 
ch1ldren and fam1l1es of Mame I love Ma1ne’s people I love Mame’s publ1c school educators 
Most of all, I love Ma1ne’s mcred1ble school chlldren They deserve our very best It 1s because I 
bel1eve our ch1ldren deserve our very best that I am sharmg my testunony w1th you here todayI 
need to share w1th you a recent and troublmg trend that I belleve 1s caus1ng harm to pubhc 
schools across the state of Mame 
Before I share th1s concern, I bel1eve 1t 1s unportant for me to be up front and clear that I fully 
support and have cons1stently worked to uphold Mame’s FOAA laws throughout my career I 
belleve F OAA 1s a foundatlonal aspect of accountab1l1ty for our government mst1tut1ons 
(1nclud1ng pubhc schools) FOAA, when used appropr1ately, hes at the heart of a democrat1c 
govemment Transparency and open dec1s10n-makmg are essent1al to ensurlng contmued tmst 
and conﬁdence 1n our government and 1ts pubhc mst1tut1ons As 1s stated on Ma1ne’s FOAA 
webpage “Open govemment 1s good govemment ” and I couldn’t agree more
l
\ 
Unfortunately, I beheve that 1n some lnmted crrcumstances FOAA 1s bemg mlsused, not asa 
means of gathermg mformatlon, but as a means of promotmg a pohtrcal agenda and/or as a means 
of drvertrng valuable human and monetary resources away from our pubhc schools, away from 
ehrldren I beheve that LD 1649 goes a long way m helpmg to ensure that FOAA laws remam the 
strong bastrons of our democracy that they should be and I urge your support 
A Qulck Story... 
Brror to the sprmg of 2022, the Gorham Schools had recerved at most 2-3 FOAA requests per 
year In the sprmg of 2022 the Gorham Schools recelved 25 requests Thus far durmg the 2022- 
23 School Year we have recelved 57 add1t1onal requests for a total of approxrmately 82 requests 
1n _]L1SlZ one calendar year 
Rhonda Warren 1s a 3 8-year veteran pubhc school servant She has worked as the assrstant to the 
Supermtendent 1n Gorham for all 38 of those years (plus 7 more 1n MSAD 6 before that) She has 
seen 1t all 1n pubhc schools and 1s a valued member of the Gorham Schools staff For 37 of those 
years she has been able to do her _]0b extremely well She answers phones, she manages 
calendars, she rssues work agreements and contracts She mputs staff data mto NEO, she tracks 
all requlred certrﬁcatlons for 500+ staff, she tracks staff years of experlence, she prepares and 
asslsts 1n contract negotratlons, she completes student attendance reports and a myrlad of other 
state requlred reports, and she 1s our homeless lrason She clearly works hard and 1s not afrald of 
hard work 
Last year she became so mundated wrth FOAA requests that she couldn’t perform these dutres to 
the levels of servrce she had been used to For the ﬁrst trme m 37 years she fell behmd 1n reports, 
she had to rush to get data mput mto systems and she d1dn’t have tune to track down employee 
certrﬁcatrons For the ﬁrst tune 1n 37 years Rhonda felt lnadequate She felt llke she couldn’t do 
her _]Ob anymore She felt lrke what she was domg was no longer meanrngful 
What changed’? F OAA requests If you were to look at the 87 total requests made durmg that 
year — they lnvolved a total of 121 5 hours of t1me Rhonda’s trme Thls tlme lS_]US1Z the tlme 
lrsted -1tdoesn ’t mclude the trme Rhonda had to spend organrzmg requests and makmg sure each 
one was responded to m the approprlate mam1er, and w1th1n the approprlate tlme frame It 
doesn’t mclude the tune she had to spend w1th legal councrl makmg sure that she was followmg 
the law It d1dn’t count the tlme she “had to spend trackmg down mformatron bemg requested and 
makmg sure prmcrpals, teachers and others were respondmg to the data collect1on requests that 
were bemg made 
It got so bad that m December of th1s year, we had to hlre a part tlme person to ass1stw1th FOAA 
requests _]l.lS1I so that we d1dn’t bum Rhonda out of the _]0l) she loved and cared about so dearly 
The Data At A Glance... 
‘ 0 87 FOAA requests 1n one calendar year 
0 121 5 total hours of “b1llable ” trme Untold hours of other trme 
I Over $25,000 00 m legal fees expended on FOAA alone Currently we are $80,000 00 
plus over our legal fees hnes 
0 15 drfferent requesters total, 55 of whrch came from 1 person 
Legltlmate Questlons/Seeking Information or Malicious Intent"??.. . 
A quote from one FOAA request to the Gorham Schools dated 9/26/22
\2
“Thrs should be a very easy ask for your IT person to search for, well w1th1n the two free 
hours of the Marne F OAA laws If you decrde to try and respond W1th some asmme 
charge for publ1c mformatlon, I’ll srmply revlse my response and we can do th1s dance 
back and forth for a number of weeks, or months”
I 
Thrs one was eventually wrthdrawn by the requester, but later on, that same requester made 
another F OAA request regardmg another matter dated 11/ 1/22 and when they were notlﬁed 1t 
would be 8 hours (6 hours of charged tune) they broke the orrglnal request 1nto four separate ones 
all dated 11/10/22 
A quote from Soc1alMed1a (Mame Flrst PI‘O]6CL Tweet dated 5/ 1 8/22) 
“Start to FOAA your school d1str1ct and expose what’s happemng for local electrons to make 
change and November electrons to flrp th1s state red” 
A quote from Socral Med1a (Shawn McBrea1rt _x;, Tweet dated 3/9/23) 
“As we expose the rgnorant, lrke Hennon, ME Super1ntendentM1cah Grant and have ﬁled a c1v1l 
lawsult agamst h1m for callmg 911 on me for takmg a photo, I ask you to start usrng FOAA/FOIA 
as your greatest weapon to expose these pub11c schools” 
A quote from Soclal Med1a (WWW DavesPaper com tweet dated 3/7/24) 
“Schools know FOAA/FOIA w1ll crack open what’s happemng 1ns1de the brrck walls Use your 
most powerful tool and hold them accountable” 
Why You Should SUPPORT LD 1649 
l It places reasonable safeguards on the use (or rather mlsuse) of th1s rmportant law 
2 It charges a more reasonable fee for servtce $25/hr w1th employee related costs barely 
covers a m1n wage posrtron conduct1ngth1s work let alone professronal educators takmg 
the1r trme to complete thrs nnportant work Even Rhonda gets $31 00 per hour to 
perform the tasks of an assrstant to the supermtendent An exper1encedteacher ’s hourly 
rate 1s closer $5 5/hr T1me spent by admmrstrators would be more l1ke $65/hr 
3 It allows multrple requests to be treated as cumulatlve 1n nature, accountmg for actual 
costs assoclated wrth fulﬁllment of the requests 
4 It allows for an mdependent thlrd party to determme whether requests are “frrvolous ” or 
not 
5 It allows for the creatron of a common template for FOAA requests so that 1nd1v1duals 
charged wlth processmg requests can more readlly see and understand what 1s bemg 
requested and respond more lmmedrately W1lZl1OLllZ havmg to wade through what can be 2- 
3 pages of text to determlne What the actual request for mformat1on 1s 
Overall, I belleve these safeguards are very reasonable They allow us to mamtaln the mtegnty of 
thls very rmportant law wh1le balancmg the need to ensure 1t 1s not eroded through contmual 
mrsuse and abuse that ultlmately cost our taxpayers more money, and take away tlme and 
resources from publlc schools that could otherwlse be spent focusmg on chrldren 
I would encourage 1nd1v1duals to go to our webslte (www gorhamschools org) and to chck on the 
“Commumty Tab” and then chck on the “FOAA” hnk to vrew the full hrstory of FOAA requests 
made over the past calendar year to assrst you 1n garnmg the full scope of understandmg for my 
request to you to support LD 1649 1n 1ts entrrety

I thank you for your tlme and commltment to th1s rmportant pL1bllC law auned at protectmg our 
lncredlble democracy I am happy to provlde any add1t1onal clanfylng mformatlon to members 
of the Judlclary Comm1ttee at any tune Thank you for all you do m your thankless roles as 
publlc servants and thank you for llstenmg 
Srncerely,
