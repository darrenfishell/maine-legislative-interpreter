Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1649:
“An
Act
to
Support
Local
Governments
in
Responding
to
Freedom
of
Access
Act
Requests”
Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1649.
If
passed,
public
transparency
under
LD
1649
would
be
sorely
diminished.
Sadly,
it
would
increase
the
speed
at
which
Mainers
are
losing
access
to
their
government,
as
we
have
been
moving
in
the
wrong
direction
of
press
freedom
and
transparency.
Unfortunately,
Maine
Policy
Institute’s
experience
with
FOAA
over
the
last
several
years
with
the
Mills
administration
has
been
markedly
different
from
our
interactions
with
that
of
former
governors
John
Baldacci
and
Paul
LePage.
Some
of
our
requests
have
seemingly
been
ignored
by
the
current
administration.
Two
filed
in
October
2021
remain
unfilled
today.
They
concern
a
so-called
“advocacy
journalist”
policy
used
to
restrict
select
journalists
from
CDC
briefings
in
October
2021.
1
LD
1649
would
add
a
new
provision
at
§408-A,
sub-§13
requiring
that
a
school
employee
be
notified
if
they
have
been
subject
to
a
FOAA
request.
Why
should
public
school
employees
be
afforded
this
special
privilege
in
Maine
law?
The
only
other
instances
requiring
notification
in
Title
1
refer
to
the
state’s
duty
to
report
to
the
public.
The
bill
also
stipulates
that
requesters
lose
the
courtesy
of
not
being
charged
the
first
two
hours
of
staff
time
to
fulfill
their
request,
starting
at
just
their
second
request
in
that
calendar
year.
This
needless
provision
would
effectively
punish
Mainers
who
choose
to
be
active
in
their
government.
Because
the
state
serves
the
people,
or
at
least
it
should,
this
committee
should
quickly
dispense
with
this
bill.
It
would
put
the
public
farther
away
from
local
public
servants
and
the
truth.

Please
deem
LD
1649
“Ought
Not
To
Pass,”
and
instead
strengthen
the
public’s
right
to
hold
public
servants
accountable.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
