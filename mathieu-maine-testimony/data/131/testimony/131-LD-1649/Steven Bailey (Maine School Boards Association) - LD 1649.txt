TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L D 1649 
AN ACT TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RESPONDING TO 
FREEDOM OF ACCESS ACT REQUESTS 
Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen and members of the Jud1c1ary Commrttee I am Steven Barley, 
executlve dlrector of Marne School Management Assocratron, test1fy1ng on behalf of the leglslatrve 
commrttees of the Marne School Boards Assoc1at1on and Marne School Superrntendents Assoclatlon, 1n 
support of L D 1649 
Our assocratlons support th1s b1ll because 1t puts some reasonable parameters around Freedom of Access 
requests It 1s rmpoltant of course to follow through w1th these requests, yet what we are seerng 1s some have 
become more burdensome on school drstrrcts and are tyrng up valuable staff trme 
We beheve there are requests berng made that do _]I1St as the brll suggests Some are fnvolous but the more 
concemmg ones are desrgned to 1nt1m1date or harass An artrcle 1n the Portland Press Herald earlrer th1s year 
reported on such requests made to the Gorham School Drstnct referencrng close to 63 FOA requests lookrng 
for mater1al related to gender 1dent1ty, sexual or1entat1on, race and prrvrlege Farther north, Hermon recerved 
25 on the same toplc 
The fee structure proposed 1n the b1ll grves the publrc two free hours for a search, unless and rmportantly the 
requestor has made the same request 1n the calendar year It then provldes for an hourly charge of not more 
than $40 
The b1ll also allows school d1str1cts to ask the op1n1on of the Pubhc Access Ombudsman to welgh 1n on the 
apparent rntent of the request to determ1ne 1f the requests are attemptrng to 1nt1m1date or harass 
Publ1c bodles, 1nc1ud1ng the school boards we represent, have found themselves 1n uncharted waters when 1t 
comes to the Freedom of Access searches now berng requested Our ﬁrst respons1b1l1ty 1n respond1ng to these 
requests 1s to support and protect our students ’ conﬁdentlallty, prevent outs1de 1nt1m1dat10n and assure 
students and staff feel safe at school 
Thls leglslatron supports that respons1b1l1ty
