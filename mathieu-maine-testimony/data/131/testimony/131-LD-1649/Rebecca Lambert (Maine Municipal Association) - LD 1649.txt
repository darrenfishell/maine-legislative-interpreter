Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1 649 - An Act to Support Local Governments in Responding to Freedom of Access Act Requests  
April 26, 2023  
_________________________________________________________________________________ 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, 
and I am providing testimony neither for nor against  LD 1 649 on behalf of the Maine Municipal 
Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC 
provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Municipal offi cials appreciate that this bill intends to assist communities with over the top and 
borderline harassing Freedom of Access requests, by including the Public Access Ombudsman to weigh in 
when there are a series or pattern of requests that seem to have a goa l of intimidation or harassment 
rather than broadly distributing information.  
The LPC was a bit confused about the addition of the requirement that a school employee be 
allowed to review the records pertaining to them before they are released to the record s requestor. Local 
leaders feel that all public employees should be subject to the same requirements and would kindly request the committee to consider amending the bill so that all public employees have the ability to review 
records pertaining to them before release or remove it altogether.  
For these reasons the LPC is neither for nor against LD 1949. T hank  you for your time and for 
considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
