TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1501  
 
AN ACT TO PROTECT MAINE CITIZENS FROM DISCRIMINATION BY  
INCLUDING VACCINATION STATUS AS A PROTECTED CLASS  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Committee on Judiciary. I am Steven Bailey, 
executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative 
committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents Association , in 
opposition to L.D. 1501.  
 
This proposed bill would add vacci nation status to the list of protected classes/criteria within the Human 
Rights Commission Act. 
 
While we recognize the concerns that were expressed during  the C OVID -19 pandemic, and the uneven 
application of admittance allowed to certain public events and  establishments, even withi n the medical field, 
MSSA and MSBA are not in agreement that vaccination status is in the same category as the others noted as 
civil rights within the HRCA – Title 5 as freedom of discrimination because of sex, sexual orientation  or gender 
identity, a phys ical or mental disability, ancestry, national origin, race, color or religion.  
 
The concern and the incidence of exclusion have widely lessened, and as such the desire to have such a protection 
included within the HRCA should not  be necessary, even though  we don’t think it even a comparable consideration.  
 
MSSA and MSBA urge the Committee on Judiciary to vote L .D. 1501 ought not to pass.
