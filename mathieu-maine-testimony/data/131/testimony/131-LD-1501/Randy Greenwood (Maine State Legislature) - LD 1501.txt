Testimony in Support of LD 1501 
“An Act to Protect Maine Citizens from Discrimination by Including 
Vaccination Status as a Protected Class” 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary. I am Representative Randy Greenwood, proudly serving 
the residents of House District 56 in Litchﬁeld, Monmouth and my hometown of 
Wales, in both Androscoggin and Kennebec counties. I’m here today in support of 
LD 1501, “An Act to Protect Maine Citizens from Discrimination by Including 
Vaccination Status as a Protected Class.” 
According to the Maine Human Rights Commission, protected classes include 
race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, physical or mental 
disability, religion, age and other categories in certain contexts. This bill would 
simply add “vaccination status” to that list. 
I want to be clear, this is not a reference to or signaling out a COVID-19 
vaccination status. This is to protect an individual ’s privacy for those that seek 
employment, housing, education and all other areas where protected classes are 
recognized. 
When we speak of “Equal Employment Rights” as deﬁned by the Human Rights 
Commission, we speak of two parts: the RIGHT to freedom from discrimination in 
employment and the opportunity for an individual to secure employment without 
discrimination is declared to be a CIVIL RIGHT. 
Finally, I believe we have reached a point that a vaccination status, for whatever 
the preventative nature is, can and should be protected from any form of 
discrimination and to protect the privacy of Maine citizens. 
Thank you and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. 
District 56 Litchfield, Wales and Monmouth
