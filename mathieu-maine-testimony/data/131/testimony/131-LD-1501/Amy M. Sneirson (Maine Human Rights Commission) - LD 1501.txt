Re: An Act to Protect Maine Citizens from Discrimination by Including Vaccination Status as a Protected C/ass- 
LD 1501 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
The Maine Human Rights Commission ("Commission") is Maine's quasi-independent, neutral, apolitical State 
agency charged with enforcing our state anti-discrimination law, the Maine Human Rights Act, 5 M.R.S. §§ 4551, et seq. 
(”MHRA"). The Commission is statutorily charged with the duties of: investigating, conciliating, and at times litigating 
protected~class discrimination cases under the MHRA; promulgating rules and regulations to effectuate the Act; and 
making recommendations for further legislation or executive action concerning infringements on human rights in 
Maine. 5 M.R.S. § 4566(7), (11). With those duties in mind, the Commission is pleased to provide this testimony 
neither for nor against LD 1501. 
As the MHRA was intended to address adverse treatment based on a person's innate characteristics (things one 
does not choose about one's self), ”vaccination status" might be an outlier within the MHRA framework. The proposed 
definition of who would be a member of the protected class is exceedingly broad; "vaccination status” means an 
indication of whether or not a person has received a particular vaccine, which might change several times over the 
course of that person's life as immunity wanes and new vaccines become available. Given what would be LD 1501's 
wide scope of coverage, the Commission anticipates that it would receive significant numbers of complaints related to 
vaccination status; the Commission's ﬁscal note reflects this foreseeable impact on the agency's operations. 
Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony related to LD 1501. The Commission would be pleased to 
discuss these issues with you at your convenience, including at the work session on this matter. 
Sincerely, 
;Zlw-3, l/l/l .?>vu1l,r.sw\.
