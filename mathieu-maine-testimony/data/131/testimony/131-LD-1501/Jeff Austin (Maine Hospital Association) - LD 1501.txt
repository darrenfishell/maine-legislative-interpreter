Neither For Nor Against 
 
LD 1501 - An Act to Protect Maine Citizens from Discrimination by Including Vaccination 
Status as a Protected Class 
 
April 25, 2023 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is 
Jeffrey Austin and this testimony is offered ‘neither for nor against’ LD 1501 on behalf of the 
Maine Hospital Association.  The Maine Hospital Association (MHA) represents all 36 
community-governed hospitals including 33 non-profit general acute care hospitals, 2 private 
psychiatric hospitals, and 1 acute rehabilitation hospital.   
This bill would place hospitals in the impossible position of having to choose which state law to 
follow. 
This bill would not allow us to refuse to hire someone due to vaccinated status. 
Other state laws require hospitals to only hire vaccinated workers.  See Chapter 264 of the rules 
of the Department of Health and Human Services:  “ Immunization Requirements for Healthcare 
Workers .”   
If this bill were to move forward, we would ask that it contain an exemption for any employer that 
is otherwise required by state or federal law to only hire vaccinated workers. 
Thank you for accepting our testimony.
