LD 1296
LD 1296, “An Act to Authorize Municipalities to Allow Firefighters to Have 
Increased Lighting on Their Personal Vehicles.
 “ Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished members of the Joint
Standing Committee on Transportation, my name isCory Reynolds, I am submitting 
testimony on Supporting LD 1296, because we need to keep our firefighters safe. All 
Firefighter’s who are responding to a Scene should by LAW have to have an 
emergency fire light to respond to the scene. I used to be a firefighter so I know what 
it’s like for a firefighter to go directly to a Scene. So please I ask you to vote Yes to 
pass LD 1296. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
