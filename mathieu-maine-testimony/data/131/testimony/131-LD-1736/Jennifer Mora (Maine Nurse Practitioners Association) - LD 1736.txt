Re: LD 1736 An Act to Advance the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in Maine by Broadening HIV Testing 
 
May 5, 2023 
 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and 
Financial Services: 
 
I am writing on behalf of the Maine Nurse Practitioner Association (MNPA) Legislative Committee and 
as a primary care Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) supporting LD 1736, An Act to Advance the National 
HIV/AIDS Strategy in Maine by Broadening HIV Testing. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is 
preventable by limiting disease transmission through widespread testing and prophylactic medication. LD1736 
provides for both the provisions of testing and prevention. 
 
As an FNP, I have witnessed firsthand the devastation of advanced HIV/AIDS in a teenager who was 
undiagnosed due to the misperception that having only one prior partner means you won’t get HIV. I have also 
witnessed a woman in her 80s with HIV who survived many years after her diagnosis due to anti-viral 
medication. The stigma of HIV prevents discussions about HIV. If healthcare practitioners promoted and 
insurance companies covered testing and prophylactic medications, there would be life-altering discussions and 
actions. 
 
According to the Maine CDC, 1,766 people are living with HIV in Maine, and about 50 new cases are 
diagnosed each year. In addition, the “Maine CDC estimates that 500 persons in Maine may be infected but 
unaware of their HIV status.”  LD 1736 aligns with the Maine CDC goal of HIV prevention through increased 
medication and access to medication. We have the tools to do more to identify undiagnosed HIV and prevent 
the transmission of HIV through the passage of LD 1736.  
 
 
Respectfully Submitted,
