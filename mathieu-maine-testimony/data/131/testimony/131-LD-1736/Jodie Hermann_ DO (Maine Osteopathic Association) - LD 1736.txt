Testimony of the  Maine Osteopathic Association  
Before the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services  
 
In Reference to:  
LD 1736, An Act to Advance the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in Maine by Broadening HIV 
Testing  
Public Hearing: Monday, May 8, 2023 10:00 AM,Cross Building, Room 220  
 
Senator  Bailey, Representative  Perry and distinguished members of the Committee on Health Cover age, 
Insurance and Financial Services , 
 
My name is Jodie Hermann, DO, FACOI, FACP, MBA. I am board certified in Internal Medicine and  
Neuromuscular Manual Medicine and I practice internal medicine and Osteopathic Manipulative 
Medicine at area hospitals, su ch as Maine Medical Center. I am pleased to provide testimony on behalf 
of my physician colleagues in support of LD1736.  
 
The Maine Osteopathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization representing approximately 
400 osteopathic physicians as well a s more than 700 residents and students. Our mission is to “serve the 
Osteopathic profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated effort of professional education, 
advocacy and member services in order to ensure the availability of quality osteopathi c health care to the 
people of this State.”  
 
We are in support of this bill for multiple reasons : 
 
- HIV is an infectious disease, which has been shown and proven to kill people if not identified 
and treated, preferably at early stages.  
- HIV is transmitted typically thr ough sexual  interactions or sharing needle s. These are actions that 
do somet imes apply to minors.  
- When assessing patient populations as physicians, we are looking for symptoms, risk factors and 
diagnostic information to  assist with diagnosing a patient in order to provide the appropriate 
treatment.  
- In the case of HIV an early diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving.  
- Diagnosing HIV in our patients not only helps the patient, but also the people around the 
individual wh o may be at high risk due to possible high-risk behaviors  with the patient .  
- Due to the history of HIV,  it has been treated as a socially undesirable medical condition, one 
that no one wanted to know they had. But as stated , it is serious if left undetected and untreated 
and can be contracted  at any age.  
- Per the CDC: About 50,000 people are infected with HIV each year, and 1 in 4  is 13 to 24 years 
old. Youth make up 7% of the more than 1 million people in the US living with HIV. About 
12,000 youth were infected with HIV in 2010.  

 2 - Per CDC in M aine new diagnos es amounte d to 57 of individuals age 13 and older in 2014 . But 
of course,  we could be missing even more, causing a delay in treatment for those affected and an 
increased risk of spread ing th is disease unknowingly.  
- Providing the ability for physicians to diagnose and treat minors when necessary and appropriate  
who may be at risk for HIV will allow patients of any age to live longer healthier lives.  
 
It is for these reasons the MOA urges the committee to vote ought to pass .
