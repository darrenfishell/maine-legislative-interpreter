I am a primary care doctor at Mid Coast Family Practice at Parkview in Brunswick, a 
primary care practice within the Maine Health network.  I am writing in support of 
this bill as someone who cares deeply about providing high quality care to our states 
most vulnerable populations.  As you likely know, HIV/AIDS affects drug users and 
sexual/gender minorities disproportionately,  and Maine currently does a very poor 
job identifying HIV while in its earlier stages.  These populations are also much less 
likely to be engaged in regular primary care so it is especially important that HIV 
testing be routinely offered in the urgent and emergency care settings.  Lastly, it is 
critically important that HIV prevention medicines be covered all insurance projects.  
They are incredibly effective and one of our most important tools in limiting new 
cases of HIV within our communities.  Thank you for taking up this very important 
issue.
