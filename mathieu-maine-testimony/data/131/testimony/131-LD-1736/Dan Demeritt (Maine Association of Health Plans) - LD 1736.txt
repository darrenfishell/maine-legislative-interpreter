Testimony of Dan Deineritt 5/9/23 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
In Opposition to LD 1736 
An Act to Advance the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in Maine by Broadening HIV Testing 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Demeritt, the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, 
Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and United Health Care. Our private 
and non-profit insurance carriers provide or administer health insurance coverage to about 
600,000 Maine people. Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people 
by promoting affordable, safe, and coordinated healthcare. 
L.D. l736 seeks to require coverage of an annual HIV test at no cost share for health insurance 
enrollees aged l3 or older and when done as part of any tests performed on an enrollee witha 
possible sexually transmitted disease or infection. 
L.D. 1736 proposes a new mandated benefit that must be reviewed by the Bureau of Insurance. 
However, the members of the Maine Association of Health Plans would share with the 
committee that this mandate for coverage is unnecessary and need not be enacted. 
The Affordable Care Act requires that preventative care benefits be provided at no cost share in 
all health plans. Services outlined by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (U SPSTF) as 
preventative and available to enrollees without cost share include HIV testing at least once a year 
for anyone aged I5-65. Younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk of 
infection, should also be screened. ‘ 
l\/laine ’s health plans already provide no-cost coverage for screening for any member who is ata 
higher risk of infection, in accordance with the recommendations of the USPSTF. That 
assessment reads: 
“A/flzozlgh all (/do/e.s*cem ‘s and adults aged I 5 r0 65 years s/2011/d be screened, there area

The Affordable Care Act Will continue to set the standards Mainers and all Americans can count 
on when it comes to access to preventative care. But by trying to duplicate those provisions in 
state law, we nsk becoming out of step with the federal requirements for coverage of preventive 
care. 
We do not take a position on the testing requireinents LD 1736 would be add to Title 5 MRSA 
§l9203-G but urge the committee not to enact unnecessary language to Maine law around health 
insurance coverage and cost shares related to HIV testing.
