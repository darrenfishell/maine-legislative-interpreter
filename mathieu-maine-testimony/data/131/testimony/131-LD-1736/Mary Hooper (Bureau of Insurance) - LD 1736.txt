Re: L.D. 1736, An Act to Advance the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in Maine by Broadening 
HIV Testing 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 1736.  The purpose of this letter is to provide 
you with background information.  Our comments are limited to the insurance-related provisions 
contained in 24-A.  This bill would require carriers offering health plans in the State to provide 
coverage for annual HIV testing for all individuals 13 years of age or older and an HIV test done 
in conjunction with tests performed on an enrollee with a possible sexually transmitted disease or 
infection.  The requirements of this bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after 
January 1, 2024.   
Currently, coverage for HIV testing is already provided as required by the Affordable Care Act 
(ACA) by insurers since it is on the USPSTF’s recommended list with an “A” rating.   According 
to their website, the USPSTF recommends  that clinicians screen for HIV infection in adolescents 
and adults aged 15 to 65 years.  Younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk 
of infection should also be screened.  As such, this screening is already required to be covered as 
a preventive service. 
Beginning in 2014, states were required to defray the costs of all mandates that are included in 
Qualified Health Plans, unless those mandates are required as part of the essential benefit 
package.  The ACA directs states to make payments either to the individual enrollee or to the 
insurer.  Generally, any mandate adopted by a state after December 31, 2011 is subject to the 
requirement for the state to defray the additional premium cost of that mandate, unless it is an 
extension of an existing mandate. 
Title 24-A M.R.S. § 2752 requires a review and evaluation of a mandated benefit proposal by the 
Bureau of Insurance before the bill may be enacted.  These reviews include an evaluation of the 
financial impact, social impact and medical efficacy of the mandate. If a report is requested it 
could cost the Bureau up to $13,500 for outside contract consulting work plus staff time, 
estimated at a cost of $1,600 to collect information, review consultant work, and prepare the final 
report.  We anticipate that current resources will allow us to conduct up to two studies during the 
current session, and we will need eight weeks for each report to ensure a high-quality evaluation.  
If the Committee wants to have the Bureau study this mandate, it may want to consider changing

the effective date to January 1, 2025 to allow time for the study and for carriers to implement the 
changes. 
I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance. 
Sincerely, 
 
Timothy N. Schott 
Acting Superintendent
