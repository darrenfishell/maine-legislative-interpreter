TESTIMONY OF DAVID JACKSON 
Executive Director 
State Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers 
In support of LD 354, as amended 
" 
An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding the Use of Engineers on Public Works 
Projects over $100,000" 
Public Hearing: February 14, 2023 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on State and Local Government, thank you for the opportunity to 
speak to you today on LD 354. 
I serve as Executive Director of the State Board of Licensure for Professional 
Engineers, which was created by the Legislature in 1935. The PE board is affiliated 
with the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation our mission is to 
regulate the profession of engineering, ”ln order to safeguard life, health and 
property. . ." 32 M.R.S. §1351. 
The definition of professional engineering in statute is broad, and includes, ”any 
professional service, such as consultation, investigation, evaluation, planning, 
design or responsible supervision of construction in connection with any public or 
private utilities, structures, buildings, machines, equipment, processes, works or 
projects, wherein the public welfare or the safeguarding of life, health or property 
is concerned or involved, when such professional service requires the application 
of engineering principles and data." 32 M.R.S. § 1251(3). 
There are several exemptions to the requirement for professional engineering, 
such as for federal employees on federal projects, minor construction like one-

and two-family residences, small farm buildings, people licensed by DHHS for 
septic systems, ships under a certain length, and so forth. 
There is a separate exemption for public works, which LD 354 seeks to modify. A 
significant challenge when creating exemptions is balancing public safety with 
real-world concerns like cost. Public works projects are financed and constructed 
with public funds and include a wide variety of infrastructure projects we use 
safely every day without a second thought because professional engineers 
protected us. 
When a proposed public project requires professional engineering, if the project 
does not exceed $100,000 and does not risk public safety, the project may be 
done without a professional engineer. However, agencies or municipalities always 
have the option to require a professional engineer. Recognizing increased project 
costs, the proposed revision increases the dollar limit of the exemption. 
Our greatest responsibility is to protect the public. We are aware that a dollar 
amount is an imprecise tool for delineating the boundaries of risk; ultimately this 
exemption relies on the good faith of municipal or agency representatives to act 
in the best interest of public safety when determining if it is safe and appropriate 
to proceed without using a professional engineer. 
We have been able to work with the sponsor and other stakeholders to arrive at 
language that provides a realistic exemption for public works projects going 
forward that continues to fulfill the mandate to protect the life, health, and 
property of the public. We support the amended LD 354.
