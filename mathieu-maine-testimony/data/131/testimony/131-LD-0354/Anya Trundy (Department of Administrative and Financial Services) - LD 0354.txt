Testimony of Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations 
Department of Administrative and Financial Sen/ices 
testifying neither for nor against 
LD 354, An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding the Use of Engineers on Public Works 
Projects over $100,000 
Sponsored by Rep. Farrin 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
State and Local Government, I am Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations 
for the Department of Administrative and Financial Sen/ices. l am providing testimony Neither 
for Nor Against LD.354. 
DAFS has no objection to the Sponsor’s amendment replacing the concept draft as it would 
apply to counties, cities, towns, townships or plantations. However, DAFS would like to request 
that during the work session the Committee consider splitting 32 M.R.S.A §1254, sub-§1 into 
two paragraphs —one pertaining to the State and the other pertaining to counties and 
municipallties —because the Bureau of General Sen/ices believes that a lower threshold is more 
appropriate for the State’s portfolio of projects, but we recognize that a one size fits all approach 
doesn’t address the municipal concerns raised by the bill. 
The current $100,000 threshold was established in 2005, which adjusted for inflation would come 
in just over $150,000. The Bureau of General Sen/ices would propose that the threshold for 
State public works projects be adjusted up to $150,000, but not above $200,000 at this time. 
DAFS has ample access to the legislature and in the future when BGS determines that project 
costs have outgrown the threshold, BGS can easily come back with a department bill to seek an 
appropriate increase. ~ ~ -T 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify. l am happy to answer any questions.
