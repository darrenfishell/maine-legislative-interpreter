Testimony of Senator Donna Bailey introducing
LD 747, An Act to Require the Probate Court to Report Name Changes to the 
State Bureau of Identification
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary
March 8, 2023
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Esteemed Colleagues of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Donna Bailey, and I proudly represent Senate District 31, 
which includes Buxton, Old Orchard Beach, and Saco. Today I am pleased to introduce my bill 
LD 747, “An Act to Require the Probate Court to Report Name Changes to the State Bureau of 
Identification.”
This is a Department bill from the Department of Public Safety to address the issue of the lack of 
ability of the SBI to link former names to new names when running a criminal background 
check. This issue was highlighted recently in York County by an incident in which a volunteer 
driver for a local organization, who was required to pass a background check including an SBI 
criminal background check, had changed his name and convictions under his previous name 
were not disclosed in the system. This driver went on to sexually assault a client with intellectual 
disabilities. Had the person’s old name and new name been linked in the system, it is likely he 
would not have been allowed to be a volunteer driver.
The final language for this bill is still being discussed amongst stakeholders, and I would ask the 
committee to hold off scheduling the work session until those discussions have concluded so that 
we can present an agreed upon amendment that takes into account the safety and concerns of 
those who legitimately need to have their new identifies shielded, but also allow the criminal 
background system to correctly identify and link old and new names where appropriate.
Thank you for your time, I would be happy to answer any questions.
