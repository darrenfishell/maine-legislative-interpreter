Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 747, An Act to Require 
the Probate Court to Report Namc’Changes‘to the State Bureau of 
Identiﬁcation: 
Senator Camey, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
some brief testimony regarding this bill. 
LD 747 amends section 1-701 of the Probate Code and requires “the court” to report “by 
electronic means a name change under this section to the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of 
State Police, State Bureau of Identiﬁcation. . .” Subsection 1 of section 1-701 of the Probate Code 
is cross referenced in section 1653(2)(F) of Title 19-A and thus applies to name changes that 
occur in District Court when a parent requests a name change for a minor as part of a proceeding 
concerning parentage or other parental rights, including actions for divorce, parental rights and 
responsibilities and other Title“ 19-A proceedings involving minor children. We point this out to 
ask whether this bill was intended to apply to minor name changes that routinely occur as part of 
a divorce or other family case. 
Thank you for your time.
