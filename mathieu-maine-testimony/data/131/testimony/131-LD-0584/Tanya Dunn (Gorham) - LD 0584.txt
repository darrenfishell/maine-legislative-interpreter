LD 584
Greetings,
I am for the proposed legislation of LD 582, An Act to Permit the Conduct of Open 
Air Cremation at Designated Sites. 
More people are seeking alternative burial options and open air  cremations provide 
an opportunity for loved ones and community to be more engaged in the entire death 
process. This process allows for a deeper relationship with grief, love and 
transformation in partnership with the land and for those who value ritual and 
ceremony. 
This is a sacred offering for those seeking more meaningful and creative ways to 
honor death with a low environmental impact and I feel passionate about this being 
another option for Mainers.
Thank you.
