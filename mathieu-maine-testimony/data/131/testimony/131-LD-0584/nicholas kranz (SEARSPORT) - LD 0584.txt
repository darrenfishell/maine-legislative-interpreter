As protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in the pursuit of 
freedom of religion, I as a Buddhist would like to be able to practice the free exercise of my 
will to be cremated in the open air, in the state that I live in when it is time for me to die.
For this practice to be conducted in designated sites, for anyone who might wish to be 
cremated in this way would be an expression of freedom and respect for the values of many 
citizens.
To be in a natural setting connected to the elements from which we all come, and be 
cremated in the open air is something my Father wished for. His wishes were not honored, I 
aspire that legislation will change to reflect the great ideals of this land in the protection of 
people's rights in regard to religious practice at the time of life and death.
