LD 584
I support LD 584 - An Act to Permit the Conduct of Open Air Cremation at Designated Sites.
I have been a practicing Buddhist for over 20 years. I am a certified Practice Instructor and 
Teacher.
Open air cremation is a longstanding historical, spiritual, and meaningful custom in our 
tradition, engaged with the utmost mindfulness and respect. 
I have visited open air cremation sites at Karme Choling in Barnet, Vermont, and at Drala 
Mountain Center in Red Feather Lakes, Colorado.
I have personally witnessed an active open air cremation at the UNESCO World Heritage Site
of Pashupati in Kathmandu, Nepal, renown as being of Outstanding Universal Value in part 
for the historical, cultural, and spiritual tradition of open air cremation. It made a profoundly 
positive impact on me, and I am grateful for the experience.
I was born and raised in, and am a resident of, Maine. I believe that all Mainers deserve the 
right to choose how their remains are treated, and should have access to the choice of open 
air cremation. It is how I would personally like my own remains to be treated.
I offer my experiences that when conducted properly with respect, sanitary conditions, and 
care that the longstanding tradition of open air cremation can be of benefit for individuals, 
families, and communities.
I support LD 584 - An Act to Permit the Conduct of Open Air Cremation at Designated Sites.
