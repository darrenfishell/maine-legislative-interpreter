Neither For Nor Against  
LD 584, An Act to Permit the Conduct of Open -Air Cremation at Designated Sites   
 
March 30, 2023  
 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee.  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony “neither for nor against” 
LD 584 on behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest.   
It is safe to say that the municipal community at large is new to this issue and as a result 
questions have been raised.  While m unicipal l eaders appreciate  the local  decision -making 
authority, public safety provisions , and the limits placed on open -air cremations proposed in LD 
584, they remain concerned with the impacts these establishments could have on neighbors and 
how grievances would be conside red and resolve d.    
To the extent the Committee believes MMA could be of assistance in these discussions,  
we are more than happy to work with interested parties to develop solutions to the issues raised.   
Thank you for considering the municipal perspecti ve on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about the Association’s position on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at 
kdufour@memun.org  or 1-800-452-8786.
