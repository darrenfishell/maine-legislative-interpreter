I will confess my iggnorance in alot of things, one of these things is speaking in the 
"legalese" that is known to reign supreme in legislative meetings.  Im sure that it 
would be easy to dismiss this bill with fiscal projections or zoning codes or some 
other facet of state government that I have yet to wrap my head around.  But some 
things simply cannot be quantified.. Six months ago I was released from a nine year 
prison sentence, and what kept me going on the straight path, and walking through all 
the corruption, venality and back-woods nepotism that reigns supreme in a state like 
Maine where the state prison is a major source of employment for multiple family 
members were two things, getting out so that i could speak out about it, and so that i 
could see my father before his declining health finally got the better of him, 
thankfully he survived until i had completed my sentence, but my father wasn't very 
tech savvy and couldn't use a phone for the last few years of his life so i never got a 
chance to speak to him, i was about to see him for the first time in twelve years in ten 
days when on Nov 15th i got a call from my sister saying he was in the hospital, me 
and my father didn't have a good relationship growing up and there were a lot of 
things that i needed to say to him, the two most important being that 1 i forgave him, 
and 2 that i loved him.  Having also found my own spiritual path through a 
polytheistic religion i am one of the few lucky enough people to have faith that 
extends beyond what i can prove, even beyond logic, or beyond what i can perceive to
be possible, so i wanted to tell my father while he was still aware to not be scared, 
that there IS something else, and that he wasn't dying, he was just going to sleep, and 
that when he woke up hed be somewhere else, i wanted to tell him to send me a sign, 
if he needed help, to picture the ravens feather i keep on my desk, and to move the 
feather, i wanted to hold that image in his mind when he went so he wouldn't be 
scared, but i didn't get to do, or say any of those things because my father lived in 
NH. I called my parole officer wanting to do the right thing even though my heart 
would and mind was telling me to leave, leave right then and get to the hospital, 
because i knew it would be a weight on my soul for the rest of my life if i didn't get to
at least talk to him ONE time, after actually making it through such a long sentence, 
But my parole officer told me i needed a travel permit and that she needed a 30 day 
notice, i explained that he was in the hospital and had been in congestive heart failure 
for over two years and was 82 she said that the only way she can give me verbal 
permission to go is if his death was imminent, which meant that she would have to get
a call from the hospital he was at telling her that the situation was emergent.  I called 
back when fifteen minutes later i got a hysterical call from my sister telling me to get 
down there, i said ok ok I'm coming, but my PO had left her office and didn't like 
giving her clients her cell phone number and had made sure to scratch it off all her 
cards, so i had to call 911 and get emergency services to track her down, by the time 
she got what she needed to give me permission and i was at the amtrak station i got 
the call saying that my father had died.  I don't want to go on forever here but i will 
say this, the way that this country handles death needs to change, because we are 
applying earthly logic to a matter that literally no person on earth has any idea about.  
The hospital he was in wouldn't even let me see him that night because he had already
been moved out of his room, all the rights , and soverignty he had a few hours ago 
had completely vanished the moment his death certificate was signed, and my right, a 
right as old as time, as old as blood, and trees and fire, my right to see my father had 
also been taken away.  Trying to make the "arrangements" was so hard for someone 
who believes, truly believes in a faith that doesn't have churches all over the globe, if 
you are not a Christian, a catholic, a Muslim or jewish then everyone just dismisses 
your religion as a novelty, one funeral home told me they only allow chaplains in the 
creamation room, another didn't care at all as long as i could pay the 1700$ for a 
"private showing", one even made a joke about me "slaughtering a pig in a bathtub", 
fortunately there are some good people left in this world and they allowed me to see 
my fathers body and push him on into the oven, but even good people are bound by 
unjust laws, i wanted to stay, to be there with him and to watch over him, so i asked if
there was any way she could leave the door open after i pushed him in, and with a 
sincere apology she said no  Nothing would have given me more comfort than for me 
and my family to surround my father, with all the items that he loved, and been with 
him there every second of the way as he changed forms, then i could have had at least 
one good, happy memory of him, but all are hard memories of nine years in prison, 3 
and a half i was kept straight in solitary confinement is one more hard memory of 
seeing him in a cardboard box, waxen skin, face purpled with burst blood vessels, and
worst of all of me having to close him into that oven where he would be all alone..... 
its easy to be cynical, to rely only on the short, scant experience we gain on our short 
time on this planet, but i am lucky enough to have seen and felt a glimpse behind the 
veil.... its been proven through the scientific process that at the moment of death the 
body loses 21 grams, humans brave enough to volunteer for the experiment and who 
knew that would be alone, in an airtight box, on a super hypersensitive scale that 
filtered out any possible outside stimulus have given sciencetist one more thing they 
can't explain, 21 grams is the weight of a chocolate bar, a pack of cigarettes, and 
possibly our souls.  I know that you are all men and women of order, of pragmatism 
and of logic but ask yourself, if after death, for any amount of time if you were to 
have even one single modicrum of awareness in any shape or form, would you rather 
be outside surrounded by your family, or alone, cared for by strangers, and then left to
burn in a cold dark oven...... I never should have shut that door, i never should have 
HAD to, but unlike most faiths, mine teaches that the body, is a PART of the soul, 
because it carries our soul for our lives, and so some of it inevitably gets trapped and 
left behind, until finally reunites them, after hearing the harsh metallic sound of a 
heavy steel door locking me in my cell, i found it one of lives cruel ironies that sound 
to, is the only thing i heard from my father after the "Get out of my house, i never 
want to see you again" i heard when i was fourteen,   But there is also a saying when 
one door closes another one opens, well i closed a door, now its time for you to open 
one..
