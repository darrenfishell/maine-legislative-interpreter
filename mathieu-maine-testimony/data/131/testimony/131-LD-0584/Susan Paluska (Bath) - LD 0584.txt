My name is Susan Paluska. I live in Bath, ME. l'm wholeheartedly in favor of LDS84 passing and here's why: The author 
of LD 584 has clearly, precisely and thoughtfully laid out the provisions of this Bill which provides for the option of 
having an Open Air Cremation versus cremation in a crematorium. I feel the open air cremation is a more sacred, loving 
and humane way to honor the body of the deceased. It also provides an opportunity for loved ones to be there with the 
deceased at the end of their earthlyjourney. lt would be good to have such an option in Maine. 
l hope you see Ô¨Åt to pass LD584.
