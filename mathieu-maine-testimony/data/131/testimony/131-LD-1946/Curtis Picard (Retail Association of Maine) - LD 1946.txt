RE: Testimony  in OPPOSITION to LD 1946, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Law to Expand the Middle 
Tax Bracket, Increase the Lodging Tax and Increase the Short -term Automobile Rental Tax  
Dear Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry  and members of the Taxation  Committee : 
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO  of the Retail Association of Maine. I am a 
resident of Topsham.  We have more than 350  members statewide and represent retailers of all sizes.  
Maine’s retailers employ more than 80,000 Mainers.  I am here today in opposition to LD 1946.  
 
Maine tourism and hospitality sector was the  most deeply impacted during the COV ID global pand emic. 
The economic harm that has hurt that industry is well document ed. LD 1946 proposes a 22% increase in 
the lo dging tax making Maine more expens ive for Maine ’s visito rs. LD 1946 a lso proposes a 50% 
increa se on the renta l car tax . Now is not the time  to be increas ing taxes on this vulnerable sector.  
 
If policymak ers want to expand and lower income taxes for certain brackets, Maine has the revenu e 
stream to achieve that without raising other taxes. As we have stated before, this is simply a poli tical 
decision for our elected officials to choose to return some of the current tax rev enue to Maine pe ople . It 
can and should be done without raising taxes. Sales  tax, income tax, property tax – take your pick. 
Maine ’s tax burden can and should be lowered in the current economic e nvironment.  
 
I urge the committee to quickly vote LD 1 946 Ought Not to Pass.  
 
Thank you for the consideration of our comments . 
 
Curtis Picard, CAE  
President and CEO
