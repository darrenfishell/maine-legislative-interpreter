 TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Hearing Date: May 31, 2023, at 1:00pm  
  
LD 1946 – “An Act to Amend the Income Tax Law to Expand the Middle Tax 
Bracket, Increase the Lodging Tax and Increase the Short-term Automobile Rental 
Tax” 
 
 
 Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee – good afternoon, my name is Michael Allen, Associate Commissioner 
for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  I am 
providing testimony at the request of the Administration Against LD 1946, “An Act 
to Amend the Income Tax Law to Expand the Middle Tax Bracket, Increase the 
Lodging Tax and Increase the Short-term Automobile Rental Tax.” 
This bill would: (1) remove the sales tax exclusion for automobiles and parts 
or accessories related to automobiles purchased by a person engaged in the 
business of renting automobiles for rental of those automobiles for a period of less 
than one year; (2) increase the rate of the sales tax imposed on lodging from 9% to 
11%, effective October 1, 2023; (3) increase the rate of sales tax imposed on the 
short-term rental of automobiles from 10% to 15%, effective October 1, 2023; and 
(4) increase the taxable income amounts subject to the middle 6.75% individual 
income tax rate by $10,000 for single and married separate individuals, $15,000 for 
head of household individuals, and $20,000 for married joint and surviving spouse 
individuals.  The top tax rate of 7.15% would effectively apply to Maine taxable 
income amounts of $64,450 or more for single and married separate individuals; 
$96,700 or more for head of household individuals; and $128,900 or more for 
2 
 married joint and surviving spouse individuals.  The taxable income bracket 
amounts are subject to an annual inflation adjustment. 
First, the Administration recommends that the effective dates for Sections 2 
and 3 of the bill be changed from October 1, 2023, to January 1, 2024.  Doing so 
will allow MRS to avoid administrative complications related to changing filing 
frequencies for annual and semi-annual filers.  Additionally, the October 1, 2023 
deadline would conflict with the implementation of the new STARS tax 
administration software and the associated e-filing capabilities for several tax 
types. 
We also recommend that the effective date for Section 4 be changed to 
January 1, 2024.  In regard to the adjustment of the middle individual income tax 
bracket, the October 1, 2023 effective date creates similar issues to those 
mentioned above, and would have an adverse effect on existing 2023 withholding 
tables and estimated tax forms and instructions currently being used.  
Next, note that the repeal of 36 M.R.S. section 1752(11)(B)(3) would result 
in short term automobile rental transactions being taxed twice; first at 5.5% when 
purchased by the person engaged in the business of renting automobiles (the 
lessor), and again at 15% when rented by the lessee.  Further, while the sales tax 
rate on short term automobile rental transactions will increase, any revenue raised 
from such transactions will go to the multimodal transportation fund under 23 
M.R.S. section 4210-B and not the general fund.  
The Administration also notes the following technical concerns:  
• Sections 5, 7, and 9 of the bill would replace the tax rate brackets as 
adjusted for inflation that have already been determined and 
communicated to taxpayers for tax year 2023 filings. 
3 
 • The taxable income amount of $148,900 shown in the second bracket in 
Section 9 (page 3 of the bill, line 31) is incorrect.  
The estimated revenue impact of the bill is not currently available.  
The estimated administrative costs depend on the final effective date 
applicable to Sections 2 and 3.  If Sections 5, 7, and 9 of the bill are amended to 
apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and Section 10 of the bill 
were to apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, the estimated 
administrative costs for those sections would be nominal and could be absorbed by 
the Bureau.  However, the Bureau would incur significant administrative costs if 
the bill is not amended; those administrative costs have not yet been determined. 
The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.  I would 
be happy to respond to any questions you may have now.
