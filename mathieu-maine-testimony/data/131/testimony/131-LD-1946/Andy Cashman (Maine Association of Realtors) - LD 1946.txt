 Testimony in Opposition to LD 1946  (“An Act to Amend the Income Tax Law to Expand the Middle Tax Bracket, Increase the Lodging Tax and Increase the Short-term Automobile Rental Tax”)  J. Andrew Cashman on behalf of the Maine Association of REALTORS® May 31, 2023 Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation, my name is Andy Cashman. I am the Founder of Resolve Government Relations, and we represent the Maine Association of REALTORS®, a professional trade association established in 1936 with over 6,500 members statewide. REALTORS® grow Maine’s economy and build Maine communities. Our members represent buyers and sellers involved in both residential and commercial real estate transactions. Our membership also includes industry affiliates, such as lenders, closing agents, title agents, appraisers, building inspectors, surveyors, etc. The Maine Association is chartered by the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR), the largest trade association in the country.  The Maine Association of REALTORS® opposes LD 1946 because it would ultimately increase Maine’s tax burden. An increase in taxes on these services would deter vacationers from visiting Maine and would negatively impact Maine’s businesses and economy. Maine is already one of the highest tax burdened states in the country. The Maine Association of REALTORS® favors a tax system that fosters economic growth. A healthy economy has a direct positive impact on real estate values.  For these reasons, we urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 1946. Thank you for your time and consideration.
