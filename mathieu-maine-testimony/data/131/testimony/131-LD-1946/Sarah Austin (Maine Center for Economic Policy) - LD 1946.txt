TestImony in favor of LD 1946, “An Act to Amend the Income Tax Law to Expand the 
MIddle Tax Bracket, Increase the LodgIng Tax and Increase the Short-term Automobile 
Rental Tax.”I 
Sarah AustIn, Dlrector of Pollcy and Research 
May 31, 2023 
Good mornIng, chaIrpersons GrohoskI and Perry, and members of the Taxatlon commIttee My 
name Is Sarah AustIn, and I am the dIrector of research and po|Icy at the Mame Center for 
EconomIc Po|Icy I am testIfyIng In favor of LD 1946 because we support Increased taxes on the 
tourIsm sector, but we feel that the Income tax cuts that thIs bIIl dIrects those revenues toward 
are very modest and that a more targeted use of the funds could result In a more meanIngful 
beneﬁt for MaIne famIIIes 
We are supportlve of an Increase In the lodgIng tax The lnstltute on TaxatIon and EconomIc 
PolIcy provIded estImates to MECEP In 2018 showIng that only 15 percent of the lodgIng tax Is 
paId by MaIne resIdents and the rema|nder Is paId by out of state vIsItors MaIne revenue 
sen/Ices sales tax reports show that the 9 percent lodgmg tax brought In $162m In calendar year 
2022 1 
An Increase to 11 percent would brIng In around $36 mIllIon more each year, only $54 
mIllIon of whIch would be paId by MaIners 
ThIs bIll would requIre that car rental buslnesses pay sales tax on automobIles and parts as well 
as Increase the sales tax on short term auto rentals from 10 to 15% WhIle busInesses shouldn't 
be taxed on wholesale Inventory that gets sold to theIr customers, busInesses do, as a rule, pay 
sales tax on purchases that they use to operate theIr busIness VehIcles rented out to 
customers should be no exceptlon, and we support removIng the sales tax exemptlon for 
vehIcle and parts purchases for short term auto rentals 
We also support IncreasIng the short term auto rental tax SImIlar to the lodgIng tax, thIs 
revenue stream Is heavIly supported by tourIsm and could be well spent Invested In MaIne 
communItIes 
For the Income tax portIon of thIs bIll, we suggest that the commIttee conslder alternate ways to 
delIver tax reductlons For a sIngle fIler, the maxImum beneﬁt of the suggested change Is only 
$25 602 and kIcks In for Incomes at or above $83,000 For households wIth Incomes less than 
$76,600, there Is no tax change at all 3 ThIs tax change Is very modest and lIkely to go 
unnotIced for taxpayers In the affected Income range 
We support other approaches to Income tax changes that could deIIver more meanIngful 
change A bIll before thIs commIttee, LD 1544, would make the state’s chlld and dependent

For tax year 2023, the top rate kIcks In for a sIngle fI|er at $58,050 In taxable Income ThIs bull would 
change that to $64,450 The dIfference In tax Is ($64,450-$58,050)x(7 15%-6 75%), or $25 60 
5 When ad]ustIng brackets and rates, It Is Important to conslder MaIne’s standard deductIon and personal 
exemptlon whIch shIeld the ﬁrst $18,550 of Income from taxatlon for a slngle ﬁler (double that for marrled 
fI|ers) Brackets and rates only begIn to take effect on Income over thIs amount That’s why a change ofa 
bracket that kIcks In at $58,050 of taxable Income doesn't actually affect a person's tax b|Il unless they 
are makIng $76,600 or more1
