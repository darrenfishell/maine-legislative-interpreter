LD 1946
I oppose LD 1946 “An Act to Amend the Income Tax Law to Expand the Middle Tax
Bracket, Increase the Lodging Tax and Increase the Short-term Automobile Rental 
Tax”.
We as Mainers are already taxed to death! Stop it!
Once again, I oppose LD 1946 “An Act to Amend the Income Tax Law to Expand the
Middle Tax Bracket, Increase the Lodging Tax and Increase the Short-term 
Automobile Rental Tax”, and it ought not to pass.
