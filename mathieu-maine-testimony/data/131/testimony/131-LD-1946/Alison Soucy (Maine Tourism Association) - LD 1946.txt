Senator Grohoskl, Representatlve Perry, and Members of the Jolnt Standmg Commlttee on Taxatlon 
My name 1s Ahson Sucy, and I am the Ch1efOperat1ng Ofﬁcer and Dlrector of Government Affalrs for the 
Ma1ne TOLlI'lS1'Il Assoc1at1on The Mame Tourlsm Assoc1at1on 1s the state’s largest advocate for all tour1sm- 
related busmesses Incorporated 1n 1922, MTA’s 1500 members mclude lodgmg, restaurants, retall, outdoor 
recreatlon, guldes, amusements, and cultural and h1stor1cal attractlons 
My test1mony 1s 1n oppos1t1on to the mcrease 1n the lodgmg tax proposed 1n th1s b1ll We hear that no one 
cares how much lodgmg tax 1s 1n Mame and that v1s1tors Wlll st1ll come We don’t agree, and 1t 1s not that 
slmple Mame contmues to be a le1sure travel market and one that caters to fam1l1es and others who are 
travellng on a budget w1th l1m1ted dlsposable mcome These v1s1tors look for value and pay attentlon to the 
overall cost of vacat1on1ng here 
Group and buslness travel, whlch the tourlsm mdustry desperately needs to retum, looks at such costs 
Accordmg to the U S Travel Assoc1at1on, group travel for meetmgs and events 1n 2022 was only 66% of 
pre-pandem1c numbers nat1onally Buslness travel, wh1le only makmg up 20% of total tr1p volume, accounts 
for 40-60% of lodgmg and alrfare revenue natlonally Th1s 1s a segment of the 1ndustry we cannot afford to 
lgnore There 1s a tlppmg pomt at whlch 1t becomes so expenslve because of artlﬁclally mﬂated prlces due to 
taxes that p0tent1al v1s1t0rs, tour companles, and busmesses declde to travel elsewhere We belleve that pomt 
1s when our lodgmg tax goes 1nto double d1g1ts--11%--wh1ch 1s certa1nly not competltlve 1n the northeast 
Mame already has a s1gn1ﬁcant state lodg1ng tax at 9%, gomg to 11% W1th th1s proposal Only ﬁve states— 
Com1ect1cut, Hawan, M1ch1gan, Rhode Island, and New Jersey--have a state lodgmg tax of 10% or greater 
At 11%, Mame would be next and hlgher than NH, our nelghbor and tourlsm competltor that decreased 1ts 
lodgmg tax from 9% to 8 5% 1n October 2021 
Tounsm dlrectly supports 151,000 _]ObS 1n Mame, accounts for $8 6 b1ll1on 1n dlrect tourlsm expendltures, 
and generates $15 85 b1ll1on 1n total economlc lmpact Th1s economlc lmpact from v1s1tors to Mame saved 
every Mame household $2,172 1n state and local taxes (Mame Ofﬁce of Tourlsm, Apr1l 2023) 
W1th state surpluses at $223 m1ll1on for th1s ﬁscal year and another $294 predlcted for next budget cycle, 
ra1s1ng one tax to lower another 1s unnecessary If the leglslature wants to lower the mcome tax, we applaud 
that declslon We strongly oppose ra1s1ng other taxes to do so 
I respectfully ask that you do not ra1se Ma1ne’s lodgmg tax and _]COpaI‘(l1Z6 th1s cr1t1cal 1ndustry Thank you 
for your conslderatlon
