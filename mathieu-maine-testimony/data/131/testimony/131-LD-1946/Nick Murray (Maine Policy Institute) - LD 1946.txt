Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1946,
“An
Act
to
Amend
the
Income
Tax
Law
to
Expand
the
Middle
Tax
Bracket,
Increase
the
Lodging
Tax
and
Increase
the
Short-term

Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1946
.
The
sponsors
of
this
bill
should
answer
a
simple
question:
Why
should
the
state
government
reap
the
benefits
of
record
inflation
while
it
gets
harder
for
everyday
Mainers
to
make
ends
meet?
Maine
is
in
a
terrible
place
in
terms
of
economic
competitiveness,
not
only
nationally,
but
compared
to
our
New
England
neighbors
as
well.
A
big
part
of
this
is
our
inordinately
oppressive
tax
regime.
In
addition
to
offering
third-highest
tax
burden
in
the
nation,
1
Maine
taxes
single-filers’
earnings
up
to
$100,000
per
year
more
than
any
other
New
England
state.
2
Maine
has
been
in
the
bottom
10
in
Forbes’
rankings
of
state
business
climates
since
it
began,
currently
44th.
3
The
cost
of
doing
business
is
9%
higher
than
the
national
average,
and
the
cost
of
living
for
Mainers
is
15%
higher.
4
Assuming
the
passage
and
enactment
of
Gov.
Mills’
proposed
supplemental
budget,
in
the
next
biennium,
the
State
of
Maine
will
be
spending
20%
more
per
resident,
even
accounting
for
inflation.
Have
Mainers
received
a
better
economy
or
a
more
responsive
government
for
all
this
extra
spending,
from
which
the
rationale
for
higher
taxes
comes?
LD
1946
would
only
exacerbate
these
issues,
diverting
more
money
from
the
productive
sector
of
the
economy
to
the
government,
whether
through
higher
income
taxes,
or
higher
sales
taxes
for
various
industries
integral
to
the
economy.
The
last
thing
Mainers
need
are
higher
taxes.

Taxes
should
only
be
levied
on
the
same
dollar
once,
if
at
all.
It
is
not
right
for
the
government
to
tax
your
earnings
before
you
even
see
them,
then
also
tax
you
when
you
spend
those
earnings.
Of
course,
it
doesn’t
end
there.
The
state
also
taxes
your
property
after
you’ve
bought
it,
simply
for
owning
it
for
another
year,
and
finally,
it
takes
a
portion
of
whatever
you
have
left
when
you
die.
This
is
far
from
fair.
LD
1946
would
raise
the
lodging
tax
from
9%
to
11%,
and
raise
the
tax
on
rental
cars
10%
to
15%.
As
much
as
the
sponsors
might
think
these
would
be
“tourist
taxes,”
this
is
not
possible.
These
increased
costs
must
also
fall
on
Mainers,
as
well
as
tourists.
Residents
like
to
take
vacations
in
Maine
too,
supporting
the
great
local
restaurants,
hotels,
and
bed-and-breakfasts
that
our
beautiful
state
has
to
offer.
These
small
businesses
need
Mainers
to
patronize
them
in
the
off-season.
Higher
taxes
on
lodging
would
make
that
more
costly
too,
to
the
detriment
of
both
Maine
residents
and
business
owners.
This
bill
would
also
slightly
raise
the
income
thresholds
for
the
state
income
tax
brackets,
and
expand
the
scope
of
the
middle
bracket.
While
it
would
raise
the
income
amount
at
which
the
middle
bracket
kicks
in
by
9.2%
to
start
at
$23,000/year
for
a
single
filer,
it
would
also
raise
the
amount
at
which
the
top
bracket
kicks
in
by
28.9%,
to
start
at
income
earned
more
than
$64,450.
Unfortunately,
even
though
this
bill
mostly
plays
on
the
margins,
it
would
still
amount
to
a
tax
increase
for
Mainers
who
have
been
forced
to
fork
over
more
and
more
of
their
money
to
a
state
government
which
has
accumulated
record
tax
revenue
in
recent
years.
The
most
prudent
move
would
be
to
significantly
cut
income
tax
rates,
while
consolidating
into
a
single
bracket,
also
known
as
a
flat
tax.
The
last
thing
Mainers
need
is
higher
taxes.
Please
deem
LD
1946
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
continue
to
reject
these
sorts
of
out-of-touch
attempts
by
politicians
to
take
more
of
our
earnings
without
consent.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
