T estzmony of Rep Poppy Arfordpresentmg 
LD 1254, An Act to Provide Coverage and Prior Authorization of Medications 
and Services During a MaineCare Provider's Enrollment Period 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Servzces 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and respected colleagues of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, I am Poppy Arford, Representative of District 101 in Brunswick Thank 
you for the opportunity to present LD 1254, An Act to Provide Coverage and Prior 
Authorization of Medications and Services During a MaiiieCare Provider's Enrollment 
Period 
This measure would require the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to createa 
process to allow providers with pending MaineCare enrollment applications to apply for prior 
authorization of services and medication pending their enrollment MaineCare would only be 
required to pay for these services after both the prior authorization request and the provider ’s 
enrollment application is approved 
LD 1254 seeks a solution to a problem that a constituent, Dr Alexander Mayer, brought to my 
attention early last fall Dr Mayer is a reconstructive surgeon at Maine General Hospital in 
Augusta, the only physician practicing in his area of specialty within the Maine General system 
Dr Mayer’s services include medically necessary procedures such as skin cancer treatment, 
cancer reconstruction, and surgery after serious burns, among many others His caseload includes 
a I1’1£:1_]0I ‘11Iy of MaineCare patients, whom he is committed to providing w1th- high quality, timely 
care 
When Dr Mayer moved to Maine this past August to care for patients at Maine General 
Hospital, he applied for MameCare enrollment He was told to expect the process would take up 
to SIX months or more It took nearly ﬁve, during which time he decided to reach out to me due 
to being deeply concerned about the MaineCare treatment and medication delays that resulted

The delays were the result of the follow1ng Although Ma1neCare would pay retroactlvely for 
care provlded durmg the enrollment penod, wh1le awa1t1ng enrollment, Dr Mayer was not 
allowed by Ma1r1eCare to submlt requests for pr1or author1zat1on of serv1ces and medlcatlons As 
_a result, the del1very of these medrcally needed servlces was delayed for months 1n some cases 
Dr Mayer’s expenence was not umque, 1t was shared by h1s phys1c1an colleagues, who were 
requlred to wa1t unt1l after thelr enrollment was approved to dehver servlces and med1cat1ons to 
Ma1neCare patlents that requlred pr1or author1zat1on 
Smce last fall, Dr Mayer and myself have communlcated and sought to work w1th DHHS to 
1dent1fy a solut1on to th1s problem Our understandmg was that noth1ng could be done Then, 1n 
late March, after LD 1254 had been drafted, we leamed that there was a solutlon the department 
found acceptable The solut1on 1s for pr1or authonzatlon requests to be subm1tted by another 
provlder who 1s already enrolled 1n Ma1neCare Unfortunately, th1s 1s not feaslble for smaller 
health care systems, hke Mame General, who may only have one provrder 1n a spec1alty area 
Fmther, there are ethlcal concerns about ask1ng a provlder who has not actually treated a pat1ent 
to submlt the pr1or author1zat1on request as 1f they were the provlder treatmg the patrent and have 
ﬁrsthand knowledge of the pat1ent’s care needs It 1s also not clear 1f th1s SOll1lI1OIl 1ncludes a 
vlable work around for med1cat1on pnor author1zat1on 
Dr Mayer w1ll testlfy today on Zoom to d1scuss hrs profess1onal experrence and perspectlve on 
how th1s presents a very slgmﬁcant and serlous barner to accesslng needed care for Ma1neCare 
patlents I want to thank Dr Mayer for makmg hlmself avallable to speak w1th the commlttee I 
strongly agree w1th Dr Mayer that any barner that prevents Ma1neCare pat1ents from accessmg 
medlcally neeessary, quallty care must be addressed The development and lmplementatlon ofa 
pnor authonzatron process that works for all Ma1neCare provlder enrollment apphcants dunng 
the1r enrollmentpenod 1s the remedy LD 1254 seeks\ 
I apprec1ate your conslderatfon of my testlmony and the need 1t presents I am happy to answer 
any questlons you may have for me, yet encourage you to also d1rect questlons to Dr Mayer who 
may be able to respond more fully to them Thank you
