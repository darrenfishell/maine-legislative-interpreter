LD 154
I am writing in support of LD 154. I am an elementary school teacher in the Kittery 
School Department. 
As a minimal receiver town, the responsibility of the school budget costs is mainly on
the Kittery tax payers. This can be a large burden for many of our residents. 
The needs of our students are growing, both educationally and social-emotionally. 
Students, as well as the educators, need resources in order to be successful in school. 
This includes counselors, therapists, support staff and professional development for 
this staff. 
Please support this bill in order to help fund the Kittery School budget.
Thank you.
