Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing: My name is Tyler Backus and I am a resident of Oakland, Maine. I write to you 
today in support of LD 154, An Act Regarding Special Education Funding for So-called 
Minimum Receiver School Administrative Units. 
My support for this bill has two caveats. 
1) It cannot start in the fiscal year 2022-23, as that is the year that we are currently 
in and it would have other implications that would be hard to remedy prior to the 
end of the fiscal year.  
2) Instead of 55%, the committee should amend the bill to follow PL2005, Chapter 2, 
Sec. D-58. This would put the special education adjustment at 100%. 
The state could look at funding this as part of fiscal year 2023-24, though it would raise 
the state beyond 55%. Otherwise it should look to put the bill into effect for fiscal year 
2024-25, so that it could be included in the 55% calculation. 
This is one of a few areas that keeps the state from fully meeting their obligation of fully 
meeting the obligation to fully funding public education in Maine. 
Thank you for your time. 
Tyler Backus
