Senator Rafferty , Representative Brennan , and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 154, An Act Regarding Special Education Funding for So -called Minimum Receiver School 
Administration Units , proposes that beginning in fiscal year 2022 -23, the minimum state share of 
a school administrative unit's special education costs under the Essential Programs and Services 
(EPS) school funding formula must be 55%. The bill also requires the Department of Education 
to ex amine the methodologies used to determine when a school administrative unit is a so -called 
minimum receiver under the EPS school funding formula . 
The Maine Department of Education is engaged in on -going review of the metrics that contribute 
to the EPS funding formula. Title 20 -A, Chapter 606 -B, §15686-A outlines  the component 
review cycle.   For example , the minimum amount of special education funding has been 
adjusted often since the start of the EPS funding formula in FY 06; most recently it was changed 
to 50% in FY 21.  
A school administrative unit  (SAU)  is considered a minimum receiver if the total c ost of 
education per the EPS formula is less than the calculated ability to pay local required share.  As a 
result, the SAU is able to cover all o r most of the EPS calculated cost of education, and the 
limited State funds are then provided to SAUs with a lower tax base to ensure all students have 
an equitable opportunity to achieve Maine’s learning results.  When an SAU is considered a 
minimum receiver, they are then el igible to receive one of four diffe rent possible adjustment s. 
The adjustments  ensure that all SAUs receive some fu nding from the State.  One of these 
adjustments is based on 50% of the special education allocation.  The current formula for 
calculating special education funding is primarily  based on actual expenditures , which means it 
is an expenditure driven model . The more a n SAU spends, the more they will get in the 
allocation.  As a result, it is difficult to control spending, and this may be adding to inequity in 
services for SAUs with lower property tax base.  
It is also important to note the interconnectedness of EPS funding formula components. 
Individual component adjustments to the EPS formula always have positive and negative impacts 
on SAUs . Given the finite amount of funding, a calculation to increase one segment will

necessarily decrease another segment. It would be prudent to examine any one element in the 
context of a comprehensive study. In order to make equitable decisions that cause the  least har m 
to our SAUs, the Department will need to dedicate time and resources to analyze the implications 
of any change.   
The Special Education allocation calculation portion of the EPS funding formula is currently 
being reviewed by MEPRI and the School  finance team.  It would be helpful if the findings were 
available prior to making a change to the percentage at this time.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 154 and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
