Re:  Testimony in Opposition to LD1918 - Dirigo Business Incentives 
 
Senator Curry, Chair, Representative Roberts, Chair, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee.  
 
 
I urge you to oppose LD1918.and vote “ought not to pass” 
 
The tax incentives proposed in LD1918 are not carefully targeted, and there are serious 
problems, not only with its rather amorphous goals, but also with regard to 
implementation related to evaluation and accountability.   
 
If the over-arching goal of this bill is to enable Maine’s people and environment to thrive, 
a total revamping of the bill is needed . The tax incentives that can best lead the state 
forward are ones that are carefully crafted. The creation of well-paid jobs may be basic to 
a thriving economy, but several studies question the efficacy of tax incentives that fail to 
accurately assess the cost and benefits of incentives and/or fail to ensure evaluation and 
accountability of these tax breaks . (1)  
 
In 
addition, 
 alternatives 
 to 
tax 
breaks 
 can 
have 
 much 
 higher 
 returns 
 relative 
 to 
cost. 
 As 
the 
Brookings 
 Institute 
 notes, 
 for 
example, 
 providing 
 “business 
 services 
 such 
 as 
job 
training, 
 business 
 advice 
 to 
smaller 
 businesses, 
 and 
new 
 transportation 
 infrastructure 
 can 
have 
 job 
creation 
 effects 
 per 
dollar 
 that 
are 
five 
to 
10 
times 
 greater 
 than 
 tax 
or 
cash 
incentives.” 
 (2)  
Another 
 example: 
 investment 
 in 
paid 
 family 
 leave 
 is 
estimated 
 to 
return 
$10  
 for 
every 
 $1 
invested, 
 according 
 to 
a 
Columbia 
 University 
 study 
 (3).  
LD1918 
 links 
 the 
size 
of 
tax 
breaks 
 to 
capital 
 investment, 
 jobs 
 created 
 and 
training 
provided
 , 
but 
seems 
 to 
demand 
 little 
 of 
the 
recipients 
 in 
terms 
 of 
quality 
 of 
jobs, 
 the 
quality 
 of 
training 
 or 
of 
the 
technology 
 used 
 or 
markets 
 served
 . 
The 
incentives 
 seem 
unlikely 
 to 
pay 
for 
themselves 
 in 
the 
long-run.  
 From 
 what 
 is 
in 
the 
bill 
text, 
 it 
seems 
 the 
past 
record 
 of  
a 
firm 
 will 
not 
be 
examined 
 in 
any 
detail: 
 how 
 does 
 the 
firm 
 compare 
 to 
other 
 firms 
 in 
the 
same 
 industry 
 in 
terms 
 of 
competitiveness? 
 of 
compliance 
 with 
 
 
regulations? 
 what 
 is 
its 
record 
 in 
promoting/hiring 
 women 
 and 
minorities?  
 in 
hiring 
locals?  
 if 
the 
firm 
 is 
part 
of 
a 
chain, 
 why 
 would 
 a 
tax 
break 
 change 
 the 
firm
’
s 
investment 
behavior 
 (typically 
 it 
does 
 not)?  
The 
industries 
 eligible 
 for 
these 
 Dirigo 
 incentives 
 include 
 very 
 few 
industries 
 providing 
services, 
 even 
 services 
 whose 
 customer 
 base 
 consists 
 of 
customers 
 from 
 out-of-state 
(some 
 computer 
 related 
 industries 
 are 
included).  
 One 
 of 
the 
fastest 
 growing 
 service 
industries 
 is 
motion 
 picture 
 production, 
 which 
 is 
not 
included.  
 About 
 77% 
 of 
GDP 
comes 
 from 
 the 
service 
 sector 
 and 
many 
 services 
 have 
 a 
higher 
 multiplier 
 effect 
 on 
the 
economy 
 than 
 many 
 manufacturing 
 firms. 
 
What are alternative uses of the tax revenue that will be lost?  Maine has urgent 
unmet needs in several areas and addressing those needs would be of greater benefit to 
the state than hand-outs which have no assurance of a net positive return. Cost  benefit 
analysis of child care,  paid family leave, land trust housing, or expanded health care can 
be expected to show higher net benefits.  As already mentioned, the return on paid family 
leave is estimated to be $10 for each $1 invested.  
 
For these reasons, I ask you to oppose LD1918 and report “ought not to pass”. 
 
 
Thank you for your consideration,

Excerpt: The tax incentives proposed in LD1918 are not carefully targeted, and there 
are serious problems, not only with its rather amorphous goals, but also with regard to
implementation related to evaluation and accountability.  It is in need of major 
revamping.  I urge you to vote "ought not to pass".  See accompanying text.
