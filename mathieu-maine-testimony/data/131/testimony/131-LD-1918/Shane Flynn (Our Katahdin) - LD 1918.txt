Written Testimony in Support of Governor’s Bill SP 780/LD1918 
Act to Modernize Maine’s Business Incentives Program by creating the Dirigo Business 
Incentives Program 
 
Our Katahdin, a Millinocket based Not For Profit involved in community revitalization programs 
and redevelopment of One North (formerly GNP paper Mill Millinocket) strongly supports 
strengthening the suite of Maine’s Business Incentives. 
Our Katahdin believes that having a strong successor program to PTDZ is essential to give Maine 
a fighting chance to compete in attracting investment to Maine and in particular to less 
developed and rural locations in the State. We believe that the Dirigo Business Incentives 
Program is the best program currently being considered to aid in attracting external 
investment. 
Based on experience that we have had over several years, it is abundantly clear that incentive 
programs operated by other States are multi-faceted and generous. Given competition from 
other States it is essential that Maine have an attractive and generous suite of business 
incentives and to that end, we implore legislators to endorse the modernization of State 
incentives, within the past year and pass SP 780/LD1918. 
Thank you on behalf of the people of Katahdin region
