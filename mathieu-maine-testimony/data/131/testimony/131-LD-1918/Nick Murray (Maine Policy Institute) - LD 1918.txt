Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1918,
“An
Act
to
Modernize
Maine's
Business
Incentive
Programs
by
Creating
the
Dirigo
Business
Incentives
Program
and
Eliminating
Certain
Other
Tax
Incentive
Programs”
Senator
Curry,
Representative
Roberts,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
On
Innovation,
Development,
Economic
Advancement
and
Business,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1918
.
Economists
have
long
criticized
politicians’
penchant
for
creating
narrow
legal
carve
outs
and
targeted
tax
exemptions
to
lure
large
corporations
to
their
jurisdictions.
Both
economic
theory
and
empirical
evidence
indicate
that
these
incentives
are
ineffective
ways
of
spurring
economic
development.
Despite
this,
the
government
continues
to
pick
winners
and
losers
when
the
elimination
of
various
types
of
corporate
welfare
could
result
in
substantial
savings
for
all
Maine
taxpayers.
According
to
Good
Jobs
First’s
Subsidy
Tracker,
Maine
has
doled
out
nearly
$930
million
in
corporate
welfare
giveaways
across
more
than
13,600
awards
since
1995.
1
The
Tracker
notes
that
211
awards
were
given
out
in
2021
alone,
including
100
awards
to
corporations
in
Pine
Tree
Development
Zones.
These
are
giveaways
that
the
state
gave
to
companies
instead
of
Mainers
in
the
form
of
much-needed
tax
reform,
at
a
time
of
crippling
inflation.
A
2018
study from
the
Mercatus
Center
at
George
Mason
University
used
these
figures
to
quantify
the
opportunity
cost
of
corporate
welfare
for
every
state.

The
table
below
shows
the
extent
to
which
the
elimination
of
corporate
incentives
in
Maine
would
allow
policymakers
to
lower
corporate
income
taxes,
personal
income
taxes,
or
sales
taxes
and
still
support
general
fund
spending.

Slashing
Maine’s
corporate
income
tax
by
one-quarter
for
every
business
in
Maine
is
far
more
likely
to
create
jobs
and
promote
economic
growth
than
offering
a
small
handful
of
corporations
massive
taxpayer-financed
incentives
with
little
oversight
or
accountability.
If
the
goal
of
economic
policy
is
to
incentivize
growth,
why
is
the
state
taking
funds
from
private
sector
actors
merely
to
turn
around
and
distribute
those
funds
to
large
companies?
Gov.
Mills
has
called
this
plan
“a
down
payment,”
but
where
is
the
so-called
down
payment
for
hard-working
Mainers
who
are
desperately
urging
the
governor
to
lower
taxes
and
allow
them
to
keep
more
of
what
they
earn?
If
lawmakers
want
to
attract
jobs
and
economic
growth,
reform
the
tax
and
regulatory
environment
so
that
it
is
more
attractive
to
start
a
business
here.
It’s
that
simple.
Please
deem
LD
1918
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
reject
this
wasteful
corporate
welfare
scheme.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
