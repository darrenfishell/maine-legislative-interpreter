TESTIMONY OF HEATHER JOHNSON, COMMISSIONER OF THE MAINE DEPARTMENT OF 
ECONOMIC & COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, REGARDING LD 1918, AN ACT TO MODERNIZE 
MAlNE'S BUSINESS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BY CREATING THE DIRIGO BUSINESS INCENTIVE 
PROGRAM AND ELIMINATING CERTAIN OTHER TAX INCENTIVES PROGRAMS 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business (IDEA), my 
name is Heather Johnson, and I am the Commissioner of the Department of Economic and 
Community Development. I am here today to testify in support of LD 1918, An Act to 
Modernize Maine's Business Incentive Programs by Creating the Dirigo Business Incentives 
Program and Eliminating Certain other Tax Incentive Programs. 
The fundamental goal of the proposed Dirigo Business Incentives program is to grow and 
diversify Maine's economy to increase the prosperity of Maine people. Dirigo Business 
incentives is comprised of two key elements: a capital investment tax credit to increase the 
amount of investment in Maine communities and a worker training tax credit to increase 
business investment in worker training, thereby strengthening Maine's workforce. This 
strengthening will support the growth of Maine's economy and increase value and mobility for 
workers. 
The existing business incentive program, called the Pine Tree Development Zone, was created 
in 2003. At that time our economy looked different, including having high unemployment as 
one of the top concerns —unemployment was over five percent when the law first passed and 
nearing nine percent when it was further revised in 2009. Since that time, the workforce 
landscape has changed dramatically. We currently have the lowest unemployment rate in 
Maine's history at 2.6% and we have more people working in Maine's economy than we have 
ever had. in the past few years our economy has grown significantly, but that growth has begun 
to moderate, in part due to a constrained workforce. We need to make sure that we have the 
tools to continue sustainable growth and diversification for Maine businesses and new 
investments in Maine communities. The challenge of finding enough workers with the needed 
skills is slowing Maine's growth, and we need the ability to offer Maine workers the opportunity 
to gain credentials that will benefit both Maine's economy and Maine people. 
The language of this bill represents more than two and a half years of work by the Department 
and an advisory group to modernize Maine's business incentive offerings. It is the result of 
months of discussions with stakeholders across the state, including the business community, 
economic development organizations, and legislators, as well as national experts. I'd like to

As part of the stakeholder process, our department heard loud and clear that there were 
concerns about program evaluation parameters and transparency in the structure of existing 
incentive programs. With this in mind, there is evaluation language proposed as part of the 
legislation. lt is in all of our interest to ensure the success and accountability of important 
legislation such as this. 
Maine's economy has a lot of room to grow through private sector investments — from large 
businesses as well as small- and medium-sized businesses. Capital investment in Maine's 
communities and workforce skill development for Maine people are the pathway to that 
growth. lt is key to have an incentive package that will keep Maine competitive in retaining 
existing Maine businesses as they expand, attracting new business investment, and supporting 
Maine entrepreneurs as they start new businesses. We believe the Dirigo Business Incentives 
program will support capital investment to give Maine workers the tools they need, and worker 
training to give them the skills they need. 
Thank you for your time, and your consideration of the bill. I would be happy to answer any 
questions you may have.
