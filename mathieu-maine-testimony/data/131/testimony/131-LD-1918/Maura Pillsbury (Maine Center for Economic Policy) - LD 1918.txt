Testimony in Opposition to LD 1918, An Act to Modernize Maine's Business Incentive 
Programs by Creating the Dirigo Business Incentives Program and Eliminating 
Certain Other Tax Incentive Programs 
May 79, 2023 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and members of the Committee on innovation, 
Development, Economic Advancement, and Business, my name is l\/laura Pillsbuiy and I am an 
analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Policy. I am here today to testify in opposition to LD 
1918. Let me be clear: this program is nothing but a massive tax giveaway. This is not an 
economic development program. This is simply a business tax subsidy in disguise, and we do 
not believe the Dirigo Business Incentive is the right approach to position l\/laine for the future. 
LD 1918 would give businesses the following: 
- up to a 15 percent tax credit for capital investment exceeding $50,000, with a lower 7.5 
percent credit for York, Cumberland, and Sagadahoc counties Z 
0 a $2,000 tax credit tax per employee trained, for businesses that pay to train three or 
more workers in an approved employee training program for as few as 20 hours 
o discounted rates on new incremental electricity usage 
The eligible sectors for the tax breaks under this bill are those with business activity primarily 
(more than 50 percent of the time) in: 
o agriculture, forestry, and fishing 
o manufacturing 
o long~distance freight transportation 
o software publishing, data processing, and computer design service 
o engineering, architecture, and scientific research and development sen/ices 
Seeking to “support economic development ” by giving money to businesses for investing in 
capital improvements and worker training assumes that: 1) there are not other constraints on 
the supply of labor; 2) that training programs are substantial enough that they increase worker 
productivity; and 3) that businesses do not have capital already to invest in equipment to 
maximize productivity. None of these things are likely to hold true. 
First, l\/lainers cannot fully access the workforce and we have a labor shortage. This bill aims to 
support a stronger workforce, but ignores the most pressing issues workers are facing. The 
need for child care, housing, adequate wages, and paid family and medical leave are the 
biggest barriers keeping l\/lainers from entering or staying in the workforce. This program 
doesn't address the root causes of our workforce shortage, which is the main challenge facing 
businesses right now. Subsidies for training or capital investment will not help businesses who 
are struggling to find workers to help them keep their doors open due to staffing shortages. v 7 4*“.V

Second, the business training activities required to receive this tax credit may already exist and 
many are already publicly subsidized, including apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and higher 
education. The amount of employee training required for businesses to receive the credit is 
minimal—just two-and~a-half work days—which is an inadequate amount of training to meet 
the need for skilled labor or complete many of the qualifying training programs. The state 
should invest directly in funding training programs for workers instead of tying the benefit to 
an employer. 
And third, this program will subsidize larger employers who already have greater access to 
resources to make bigger investments over $50,000 in their businesses and who have more 
employees, and thus will receive larger tax credits. This program would provide refundable tax 
credits of up to $500,000 per year and allow credits to be carried over for up to four years. 
This is extremely concerning —it could greatly increase the cost of the program, and it means 
the state could be cutting large checks to big businesses and out-of-state corporations. This 
also may subsidize businesses for things they may already be doing or would have done 
anyway. There is no guarantee that businesses will make any additional investments in training 
or capital expenditures they otherwise wouldn't have. 
The bill would also give discounted electricity rates to businesses for increases in consumption, 
shifting costs to other rate payers. Larger businesses with greater electricity usage will receive 
the greatest subsidy from this provision. Why would we reward businesses for consuming 
more electricity, especially in a state that is so acutely impacted by climate change? 
Sweeping business tax giveaways are not the right approach for growing l\/laine's economy. 
Instead, we should examine how we can support l\/laine businesses with the real problems 
they face, including steep competition from multi-national corporations who avoid paying their 
fair share in taxes. Unfortunately, these large corporations will also be allowed to reap much 
greater beneﬁts from this program than l\/laine ’s small businesses that are the backbone of our 
communities. We shouldn't be giving big corporations an even greater advantage over the 
hard-working small business owners. 
This bill also picks winners and losers among industry sectors—leaving out health care, child 
care, and direct care which are all in dire need of workforce supports and primarily employ 
women. This bill focuses on male-dominated industries —data shows workers in these sectors 
in l\/laine are 75 percent male} which could widen inequities and the gender pay gap even 
further, especially since there are no goals to increase diversity in these fields or metrics to 
show progress toward a goal of diversity. Programs like this don't narrow wealth inequality, 
they widen it. 
We agree with targeting benefits toward areas of the state that need them most. However, this 
program does not target rural areas as it claims. Maine has few if any targeted programs that 
do, despite being one of the most rural states in the nation. Under this bill, businesses in 
Augusta, Bangor, and Lewiston would be eligible for the same tax breaks as rural areas.
2
This bill would also repeal the Pine Tree Development Zone, Employment Tax Increment 
Financing, and l\/laine Capital investment Credit programs; the first two are already winding 
down to various degrees. We support this. However, this proposed replacement program has 
a huge price tag, which in the longer term will cost almost three times the amount of these 
existing programs. it would be fiscally irresponsible to pass this bill with a cost of $4.6 million in 
this biennium and ignore the impact ofthe future costs, which are estimated at $54.5 million 
peryean 
With these funds, lviaine could instead lift thousands of children out of poverty by increasing 
the child tax credit, improving their long-term prospects of leading healthier, more successful 
lives and participating in the workforce. l\/laine could expand access to affordable child care, 
allowing workers with children to return to jobs without spending more than they earn on day 
care. l\/laine could support start-up costs for a paid family and medical leave program, 
supporting workers in staying in and returning to the workforce. The ongoing cost of the 
proposed program is too large to risk without evidence to support whether this use of funds 
will be successful or actually have the desired impacts, when there are other evidence-based 
programs we could spend the money on instead. 
l\/laine can improve the business productivity that drives our economy, but this program is the 
wrong way to invest in these goals. Research shows that capital investment and worker training 
are in fact components that drive productivity. Capital investment and an educated workforce 
are necessary for businesses to be successful. However, according to a Brookings institution 
report" , which examined lessons from productivity research from around the world, capital 
investment and training alone are not adequate to ensure economic growth and increased 
productivity. Findings included: 
o in most cases, the way factories, offices, or retail facilities were operated were more 
important than capital investment 
n high levels of investment in some cases contributed almost nothing to productivity, for 
example, when government development policies had, in some industries, encouraged 
overinvestment where machinery was underutilized. 
l\/IECEP recently released a policy brief, Are tax giveaways worth the monei/?' ” That identifies a 
number of ways that programs like this could be more equitable and support |\/iainers and 
small businesses who really need it, including: 
o target businesses that need them, and benefit small l\/laine businesses, not large 
corporations 
o target programs and tax breaks to meet the needs of undersen/ed communities and 
businesses, not those who already have wealth 
o invest in struggling communities 
o avoid subsidizing companies that are repeated violators of local, state and federal 
regulations (such as wage or environmental regulations)

This program has minimal guardrails, but does disallow benefits in case of layoffs of 20 percent 
or more of employees for businesses with 20 or more employees, and for businesses who are 
public utilities or participating in certain other tax credit programs, including PTDZ, ETlF, the tax 
credit for shipbuilding facility investment, and paper manufacturing facility investment. 
However, businesses receiving other big tax credits- —including the major headquarters 
expansion, research and development, major food processing, high technology investment, 
and manufacturing facility expansion credits—would also be eligible for the Dirigo tax credit. 
According to l\/laine Revenue Services, the sole recipient of the major headquarters expansion 
credit had zero income tax liability in 2021, and received an $800,000 check from the 
taxpayers of lvlaine. ” We only know this because this information was specifically required to 
be disclosed by law.“ There is no such provision in this bill. 
l\/laine taxpayers deserve transparency. Currently, we don't know what corporations in l\/laine 
are paying in taxes or what most are receiving in tax giveaways. We should know that before 
we talk about big new expensive tax giveaway programs. We support the reporting 
requirements in this bill, and if the committee does support this program, we strongly 
encourage you to keep them. However, they make no allowance for the public to know if the 
state is cutting big checks to businesses, and there are no clawback provisions for the state to 
recoup tax credits if, for example, a business sells equipment or takes it out of sen/ice. There is 
also no program sunset date, which would compel the legislature to reconsider whether this 
program is worthwhile in the future. We urge you to add these provisions. 
We urge the Committee to oppose this bill. Thank you for your time. l would be happy to 
answer any questions. Contact information: maura@mecep.org

l\/laine forgoes billions of dollars in revenue each year by giving out tax breaks. These tax giveaways are costly 
and sometimes poorly targeted to achieve intended outcomes. When l\/laine dedicates resources to 
unproven tax breaks, we lose funding that could be better spent to strengthen Maine's workforce and grow 
A broad body of 
research on effectiveness 
of tax giveaways has found 
that tax give away

business behavior often 
have high price tags and 
little proof showing they 
are money well spent.

l Maine Center for Economic Policy our economy. |\/laine must raise its standards for what we 
expect of these programs and how they are administered, what 
information is available about them, and whether there is any 
evidence that they work. Legislators should not continue to 
extend and expand these costly programs without this 
information. 
The legislature has sought to understand the impact of these 
tax giveaways for decades, most recently establishing a review 
process through the Office of Program Evaluation and 
Government Accountability (OPEGA). But data challenges have 
stymied many of OPEGA's reviews and limited its ability to draw 
conclusions about program impacts. 
Instead of funneling money into unproven tax giveaways, the 
state should invest funds in programs including housing, child 
care, and paid leave that will improve economic opportunities 
for all Mainers, advance equity, and allow people to fully 
participate in the workforce. 
We must also scrutinize and reform tax giveaway programs or 
Maine will continue to hemorrhage funds needed to address 
issues that threaten the economic health of our state. To 
reform tax giveaways, we must increase transparency, improve 
business accountability and data reliability, sunset unproven 
programs, and oppose expansion of new and existing unproven 
tax breaks.
Tax giveaways cost Maine billions of 
dollars each year 
l\/laine has hundreds of tax giveaway programs 
that cost the state money — but you won’t find 
them listed individually in the state budget 
although they reduce the amount of money 
available to the state to fund other important 
priorities like infrastructure, education, and health 
care. 
While these programs are often referred to as ”tax 
expenditures" l\/IECEP uses the term "tax 
giveaways ” because they give away state tax dollars 
that would otherwise be collected. Tax giveaways 
provide money to businesses, individuals, 
nonprofits, and other entities through tax 
exemptions, credits, and refunds, and other 
targeted programs intended to reduce taxes fora 
certain purpose. Often, business tax giveaways are 
created with an expectation that companies will 
create jobs or invest in equipment and facilities 
improvements that they otherwise wouldn't have 
been able without them. 
Maine gives away 
over $1 billion in business 
tax breaks each year- 
almost as much as the state 
spends on education. 
l\/laine Revenue Services (MRS) estimates the cost 
of tax giveaway programs in its biennial state tax 
expenditure report and in total these tax programs 
cost l\/laine at least $4.5 billion each year‘ , an 
amount exceeding the entire state budget? if the 
state eliminated all tax expenditure programs, it 
would have twice the resources it has now to 
invest back into communities. While some ofthese 
programs prevent double taxation and provide 
important beneﬁts to Mainers with low and middle 
income, over $1 billion of these dollars go to 
Page 2 l l\/laine (,enter for Ecoi'ion'iic Policy business tax breaks each year ~ almost as much as 
the state spends on education. 
The resources l\/laine has to fund all of its priorities 
- from repairing roads, to supporting student 
achievement, to providing prescription drugs for 
seniors and addressing the opioid crisis — is 
reduced by these programs. With such a vast sum 
of money at stake, what is Maine getting from 
these tax giveaways? And what could we be do/ng 
instead? 
Tax giveaways benefit people with 
wealth and big corporations in Maine 
Some of the most profitable companies in l\/laine 
receive millions of dollars from targeted tax breaks 
designed with narrow criteria that only they meet. 
Often when large corporations receive big tax 
breaks like these, they pass that money on to their
Examples 
Bath lron Works is a subsidiary of defense contractor General Dynamics, a publicly traded 
company with over $38 billion in annual revenues. ‘ ln1997, BlW got a $195 million tax break 
deals" When that deal expired in 2018, a new one was created that gave the company an 
additional $45 million in tax breaks? General Dynamics spent $2.6 billion on stock buybacks 
from 2018 through 2020, boosting returns for shareholders, after its tax break was renewed. 
Meanwhile, BIW employees picketed in response to over four years of wage freezes. ’ 
IDEXX has over $3.2 billion in annual revenues “ and will receive up to $16 million in state tax 
credits for building its new headquarters in Maine?’ lDEXX argued it needed these tax credits 
to make it worthwhile to stay in Maine.‘° in 2022 alone, IDEXX executives sold their shares of 
IDEXX stock for $13 million. “ The CEO of lDEXX receives over $9 million a year in 
com pensationiz 
One of thejrichest beneficiaries of the Pine Tree Development Zones program is paper 
manufacturing company Nine Dragons Paper Holdings, which has purchased and 
rehabbed paper mills in Maine, and is owned by one of the wealthiest families in the world. ln 
addition to receiving the PTDZ credit, Nine Dragons also received $12 million in taxscredits 
under the_l\lew Markets Capital investment program. ~i 
executives and shareholders rather than investing 
in employees or their business. 
Unlike many of Maine's small, local businesses, 
these large corporations are not cash constrained 
They have the resources to invest without large, 
costly tax breaks that reduce what's available to 
improve the working conditions and economic 
stability of everyday Mainers. 
While these global corporations maintain multi- 
billion-dollar bottom lines, struggling local 
businesses in lvlaine, small startups, and entire 
sectors like the care economy are at a real threat 
of failing to sun/ive. These corporations have 
powerful lobbies that inﬂuence government policy 
to maximize their profits at the expense of Maine 
people. They argue they need these beneﬁts to 
continue investing in l\/laine, but the profits they 
report to shareholders and their Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) ﬁlings show 
otherwise. 
Page 3 | lvlalne Center for Economic Policy Why are we helping to pad the profits of global 
corporations instead of using those resources to 
the benefit of Maine people and small businesses? 
While these corporations provide thousands of 
jobs and stimulate economic activity in Maine, they 
will continue to do so with or without tax giveaways 
provided at the expense of Maine people and 
small businesses. 
Businesses face other barriers to 
success that tax breaks do not address 
Giving away money to businesses doesn't address 
the root causes of real challenges they face, such 
as workforce shortages driven by low wages, skills 
mismatch, lack of paid leave, and unaffordable 
child care.” Supporting tax giveaway programs in 
hopes they will solve the challenges facing an 
industry or Maine's economy is putting a band-aid 
on a problem, rather than finding solutions ata 
deeper systemic level. Instead of giving money

investors, l\/laine could invest in supports that 
make the state a great place to do business, 
including infrastructure like good roads, fast 
internet, and reliable cell service. The biggest 
challenges impacting Mainers also impact the 
ability of businesses to succeed — health care, 
affordable housing, and child care. 
Outcomes and impacts of Maine tax 
giveaways, particularly for businesses, 
are often unclear 
Unlike the EITC, we cannot draw a clear link 
between the majority of tax giveaway programs in 
Maine and their intended purpose -- or what the 
state and taxpayers get for this money. ln 2015, 
the Legislature set up a review process to get to 
the bottom of this conundrum. The Legislature's 
Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability (OPEGA) is tasked with review of 
l\/laine's tax giveaway programs, reporting to the 
Taxation and Government Oversight committees. 
OPEGA's tax expenditure review process has been 
identiﬁed as one of the most robust in the 
nation.” 
OPEGA has repeatedly reached concerning 
conclusions across its evaluations of multiple 
business tax giveaway programs, including: 
- program data to measure outcomes is 
often either not collected, inaccessible, or 
unreliable 
Page /l 
l l\/lalne Center for Ecorioinic l?’<.>llt.y o program goals often do not align with 
program design or implementation, are 
vaguely defined, or are not defined at all 
o administrative oversight is challenging 
OPEGA's research findings mean lvlaine isn't 
getting the bang for its buck out of some business 
tax giveaway programs that some people thought 
it was. OPEGA's findings of some programs has 
called the efficacy of these programs into question 
OPEGA's findings have also led state agencies and
the legislature to clarify program goals, identify 
new data needed to evaluate the outcomes of 
programs, and shore up data collection 
procedures for some programs. “ But work 
remains to ensure accurate data is collected and 
accessible across Maines tax giveaway programs 
and outcomes are worth the cost. 
Data is inaccessible, unavailable, or 
unreliable 
The outcomes and impacts lawmakers and others 
hope tax giveaways will have can be difficult to 
measure or evaluate. Data is often hard to access 
because when programs are created many don't 
require transparency of how much money 
individual businesses receive in tax giveaways. 
Even when data is made accessible to evaluators, 
archaic state systems that use PDF files and paper 
applications rather than machine-readable data 
can make it difficult to easily query systems for 
information. For those programs that do require 
data collection, inconsistent data collection has 
sometimes been an issue. In the past, the state 
required businesses receiving tax giveaways to 
report information to the Department of Economic 
and Community Development, but this 
requirement was repealed in 2009, leading toa 
Good Jobs First findings patchwork of data that is collected across 
programs and state agencies today.” Some 
programs have reporting requirements embedded 
in their statutes, but this is not consistent across 
programs. As a result, data is often inaccessible, 
unavailable, or unreliable. 
Supporting tax 
giveaway programs in hopes 
they will solve the- 
challenges facing an 
industry or Maine’s 
economy is putting a hand- 
aid on a. problem, rather 
than finding solutions ata 
deeper systemic level. 
However, OPEGA found much more data was 
available for one tax program it reviewed — the 
Historic Preservation credit. Due to robust data 
collection requirements for the federal version of 
credit and diligent reporting, OPEGA discovered 
the credit was unique in its degree of transparency 
and accountability. ” As a result, OPEGA was able 
While Maine has a robust tax expenditure review process, a recent report from Good Jobs First” finds 
Maine's online transparency on business tax giveaways ranks among the worst in the nation due to the 
lack of data transparency. Based on areview of ﬁve Maine business tax breaks, which are estimated to 
cost Maine taxpayers over $96 million in FY23,” researchers found a lack of transparency in Maine 
around which companies are receiving them and what is being done with the money. Lack of 
transparency undermines accountability. If information about recipients of business tax giveaways is 
kept secret, how can we evaluate whether the programs are accomplishing their goal of creatingjobs, 
promoting innovation, or increasing wages? Or compare the public costs of providing tax giveaways 
with the benefits to our communities and workforce? We also can't see if companies are holding up 
their end of the bargain by making the investments promised. Other states have solved this 
transparency problem by making information easily accessible online and readily usable to any member 
of the public. in Maine, company speciﬁc data can be requested via freedom of access act requests. lf 
this data is available through FOAA, it should also be posted online for everyone to examine.

to do a full and thorough review of the credit and 
its impacts and provide information to the 
legislature on the outcomes the state is seeing 
from this program and whether it is sen/ing its 
purpose. 
The Texas comptroller provides data ona 
public dashboard, showing who receives 
payments from economic development 
funds.” Nevada's Office of Economic 
Development posts reports publicly for its 
programs, includingjob, wage, and capital 
investment data?“ Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, and New York also disclose 
which companies receive various tax breaks. 
As the legislature has attempted to look at the 
impacts of tax giveaway programs and whether 
they are worth the money, data challenges make it 
difficult to definitively draw conclusions about 
l\/laine ’s programs and their effectiveness. Without 
this information, we are in the dark about whether 
the money the state is giving away could be better 
spent elsewhere. But there is at least one example 
(the Historic Preservation credit) of a l\/laine 
program that is collecting the necessary evaluation 
data, showing it can be done. 
In 2019, the Legislature funded up to $46 million 
to modernize MRS systems to address data 
collection issues.” They are currently in the 
process of rolling out this system. The Taxation 
Committee is currently considering legislation

improve these systems and make information 
transparent to the public. 
Program design and goals are 
misaligned or unclear 
When the legislature sets out to create a new tax 
giveaway program or expand an existing one, 
there may not be a clear link between the tax cuts 
a program creates and the desired goals and 
hoped for outcomes of the program. OPEGA has 
found this repeatedly in its evaluation of business 
tax giveaway programs. 
Proponents of business tax giveaway programs 
often make assumptions they will have certain 
impacts that are not proven. This leads Maine to

waste taxpayer dollars on ineffective programs 
that don't have the hoped for impacts. 
Administrative oversight is 
challenging 
OPEGA has identified gaps in administrative 
oversight during its reviews, but because the 
programs are intensive to review (completed ata 
rate of about two per year) it takes time to identify 
and correct these gaps.” State agencies 
administer programs with minimal resources and 
sometimes have little control over data reporting 
or have other competing priorities. Program 
management is spread across several different 
agencies that have purview over the programs, 
with staff who perform similar data collection 
functions. OPEGA recommended centralizing this 
function rather than having the agencies 
administer it on their own. This could help address 
the gaps in oversight and challenges agencies face 
in ensuring accurate data is collected and 
available. Further, a centralized database and 
public reporting like dashboards used in other 
states could improve program transparency. 
Policymakers may want to consider the costs 
and benefits of the current model of 
decentralized data collection and 
management for tax incentives performed by 
individual program stajj‘ across administering 
agencies and consider alternatives. For 
example, the State might consider whether 
there is cause to centralize a data 
management function for tax expenditures in 
the State or whether to create an entity that 
could provide guidance and assistance to 
those tasked with data management in the 
absence of such a centralized entity. - OPEGA

Research shows business tax 
giveaways aren't worth it -— and there 
are better ways to support growth 
While data on specific lviaine tax giveaways can be 
challenging to obtain, a broader body of research 
on effectiveness of tax giveaways has found that 
tax giveaway programs targeting business behavior 
often have high price tags and little proof showing 
they are money well spent. Presumptions 
underlying the creation of business tax giveaway 
programs have been disproven but continue to 
shape state policy. Findings from research on tax 
giveaways include: 
~ at least 75 percent of the time, businesses 
would have made an investment anyway 
without a tax giveaway 
o on average, only 10-30 percent of newjobs 
go to state residents who are not already 
employed 
o new workers moving from out of town or 
out of state raise costs to public services, 
which offsets most of any increased tax 
revenue“ 
~ many of these programs are poorly 
targeted to benefit places and people in 
need” 
- even if subsidies create some economic 
gains, those gains are transferred to 
subsidized companies ” 
~ because subsidies beneﬁt corporate 
owners and shareholders, they exacerbate 
income and race inequalities “ 
~ subsidies do not appear to generate 
measurable improvements in the broader 
state or local economy“
Business tax giveaways shift costs onto Maine taxpayers 
Business tax giveaways shouldn't go to supporting massive corporations, but instead lifting up small 
businesses that are cornerstones of Maine communities. Like the rest of the country, Maine is 
struggling with the impacts of inflation resulting in part from corporate consolidation —— too few 
corporations controlling too much of the food and energy sectors. ” Supporting local businesses 
increases competition and takes power away from massive corporations to raise prices and pay low 
wages. 
By decreasing taxes for big businesses, these programs shift the costs of public services from big 
businesses to other Maine taxpayers, including small businesses. The large sums of money we are 
giving away to big, profitable corporations could be better spent supporting small Maine businesses 
and communities still recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
One of Maine's largest business tax giveaways primarily benefits large businesses: 
'7 he 70 businesses with the highest ETIF beneﬁts in FY78 received a total of $ 7. 7 million, which is 53% of the 
payments made to all businesses in that year. The average payment to these businesses was approximately 
$ 77 0,600. Payments to the remaining 725 businesses in that year averaged just $49,613 per business. The 70 
businesses with the smallest payments had an average payment of $5,1 72.” - OPEGA report on Employment 
Tax Increment Financing (E TIF) program” 
Good jobs first tracks Maine business tax giveaway data that is available for top corporations. ” in 20 7 9, 
recipients of the largest Business Equipment Tax Reimbursements tax breaks, the only Maine program that 
discloses recipients online, were these large corporations: Hannaford, Texas Instruments, Bath iron Works, 
Sappi North America, Nestle Waters North America. 39

The funding used for giveaways to businesses 
could be directed toward other important 
priorities in |\/laine — including schools, broadband 
access, and paid family leave — that would make 
our state and communities a more attractive place 
to live, work, and do business and level the playing 
field to provide economic support and 
opportunities for l\/lainers and small businesses to 
thrive. investing money in people over 
corporations — via policies like child care subsidies
and the child tax credit — will give businesses the 
supports they need to retain workers and be 
successful. 
Impacts of tax giveaways on racial 
equity and wealth inequality 
Business tax giveaways have broad systemic 
impacts on racial equity and wealth inequality. 
These programs often provide additional 
resources to businesses that already have access 
to other resources and advantages. They 
perpetuate inequality by further consolidating 
wealth among individuals who already hold it. They 
often give money to big businesses with wealth, 
further perpetuating the consolidation of 
corporate power. By giving more money to those 
who are already well-resourced, these policies 
reinforce structural racism and underinvestment in 
under-resourced areas. 
A Good Jobs First report examined uneven 
economic development occurring across five major 
US cities, finding some areas of the cities were 
growing and developing rapidly while others were 
declining. They found cities struggled to ensure 
residents benefited equally from development 
across their neighborhoods, and economic 
development programs were often investing in 
areas where others were already investing or 
supporting large companies and developers, and 
not neighborhoods with underinvestment, which 
are disproportionately communities of color.“ 
As in the rest of the country, data also show that 
the rate of business ownership among Black 
l\/lainers is lowerthan white, non-Hispanic 
residents, and Black lvlainers earn significantly less 
income than their white peers.“ On a national 
level, we know that white people are significantly 
more likely to own stock“ and to be corporate 
e><ecutives,47 meaning corporate wealth is 
concentrated among white people, and therefore 
business tax giveaways are more likely to benefit 
white people than people of color. White people in 
the US also hold much greater wealth than Black 
Page 9 | l\/laine Center for Economic Policy people due to generations of discriminatory public 
policies. “ Minority owned start-ups are also likely 
to have greater difficulty accessing capital“ and 
Black and minority-owned businesses were 
disproportionately likely to be in sectors adversely 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including 
leisure, hospitality, and retai|.5° 
Economic development 
programs were often investing 
in areas where others were 
already investing or 
supporting large companies 
and developers, and not 
neighborhoods with 
underinvestment, which are 
disproportionately 
communities of color. 
Underinvestment has also acutely impacted rural 
l\/laine. l\/laine doesn't track where in the state its 
tax giveaways are used, and few, if any of them 
specifically target rural areas of the state. l\/laine 
should channel resources into rural areas of the 
state instead of giving them to businesses in areas 
that are already thriving. Maine Center for 
Economic Policy detailed rural economic 
development strategies for Maine in a 2007 report, 
5‘ but these investments were not made under the 
LePage administration? While lviaine’s 10 Year 
Economic Development Strategy highlights the 
development of rural broadband and hubs near 
rural areas, it does not explore how the state could 
shift resources from tax giveaways to undersen/ed 
areas.” 
Making investments in underserved communities 
can help reverse historical inequities. lvlaine 
should pursue tax policies that help all 
communities thrive, including:
o Offer greater access to higher education to 
all Mainers by continuing l\/laine's free 
community college program 
0 Invest in growing skills and the abilities of 
Maine's increasing immigrant population to 
help address Maine's labor shortage 
~ Support underserved communities in 
accessing capital to start their own 
businesses 
0 Support community development financing, 
which makes loans available to those who 
otherwise would not be able to access 
them 
- Target programs and tax breaks to meet 
the needs of underserved communities 
and businesses, not those who already 
have wealth. 
Researchers at the Brookings institution examined 
how business tax giveaways could be improved to 
support inclusive and equitable growth. They 
found promising use of inclusive scorecards to 
target growth, mapping equity indicators, and 
structuring tax breaks to focus on government 
fiscal health?“ 
When I\/laine gives away public funds to businesses 
regardless of need, we perpetuate wealth 
inequality and further concentrate wealth in the 
hands of already wealthy individuals and 
businesses. l\/iaine should prioritize making 
investments in areas that target, rather than 
perpetuate, this inequality and invest in its people, 
communities, and small businesses — not tax 
giveaways to wealthy corporations. 
Some incentives are better than 
others 
When data is available, tax giveaway programs can 
be targeted and outcomes tracked in a way that 
helps us judge whether they are worthwhile 
investments. But what are the characteristics that 
can help us determine whether a tax giveaway is 
successful? Researcher Timothy Bartik of the 
Upjohn Institute developed an evidence-based 
Page it) l\/laiiie (feriter for Economic Policy checklist for well-designed tax giveaways. “ The 
Pew Center has also done extensive research on 
tax giveaways “ and provided technical assistance 
to states, including Maine, in designing tax 
giveaway review programs. 
Based on these and other resources, lawmakers 
should consider factors including whether 
business giveaways: 
- create investment in high-growth sectors 
~ add high-qualityjobs (in terms of pay, 
beneﬁts, and duration) 
- target businesses that need them, and 
beneﬁt small Maine businesses, not large 
corporations 
v advance equity by investing in historically 
marginalized and underserved 
communities that are blocked from 
accessing capital, or disproportionately face 
other challenges to success
v invest in struggling communities 
~ target export businesses rather than 
displacing existing local businesses 
o avoid subsidizing companies that are 
repeated violators of local, state and 
federal regulations (such as wage or link economic development to workforce 
development policies, such as training for 
unemployed through neighborhood 
employment hubs“ 
tie tax giveaways to budget constraints and 
pay for them with higher business taxes 
environmental regulations) 
Conclusion 
Business tax giveaways in l\/laine need greater scrutiny and reform because they take funds away from other 
important public priorities and shift costs onto other l\/laine taxpayers. Little data is publicly available on who 
receives these tax breaks and how much they avoid paying in taxes as a result. We must increase program 
transparency and accountability to ensure these tax dollars are not wasted. 
The legislature has created an evaluation process for business tax giveaway programs, but it is stymied by 
data limitations. Often these evaluations cannot confirm these programs are delivering the results they 
promise. 
We must also more closely question assumptions about the ability of business tax giveaways to add jobs and 
create economic activity that would not have othen/vise occurred. With so many other urgent needs to 
address -- including housing, paid leave, and child poverty — we could make better investments for l\/laine 
workers, families, and communities with most of the money we lose through fruitless business tax giveaways. 
Rather than expanding existing tax giveaways or implementing new ones, Maine should reform its approach 
to business tax giveaways. 
Business tax giveaway reforms to pursue 
- Program transparency: make data on business tax giveaways transparent and easily 
accessible to the public, including what individual businesses receive in taxbreaks and for what. 
~ Business accountability: ensure businesses receiving tax giveaways fulﬁll expected 
outcomes, and if they do not, ensure that strong clawback provisions are in place. 
~ Data reliability: centralize data reporting and improve data collection systems for tax breaks. 
~ Prog ram sunsetting: end unproven tax giveaways and dedicate resources to evidence-based 
policies and programs. 
o Oppose expansion of unproven tax breaks, new and existing: Maine should not 
continue to expand or extend programs without proven outcomes when there are better,l 
proven ways to achieve the outcomes tax giveaways often promise but do not deliver.
