Esteemed Members of the Committee:
Please consider making the agricultural, forestry, and fishery credit applicable 
statewide without the County limitation.  Good soil knows no political boundaries.  
Under the law as drafted three farmers in Hiram, Cornish, and Baldwin would all 
receive different treatment.  This bill will have perverse impacts encouraging farms in
southern counties to close up shop and turn into house lots and farmers relocate to 
different counties.  Limiting the credit for York and Cumberland and Sagadahoc 
makes sense for the other industries identified, but farming, forestry, and fishing is 
difficult enough as is and if we want to grow those areas we should not create 
artificial geographic barriers.
