"The NMISA, a non-profit entity responsible for the administration of the northern 
Maine transmission system and electric power markets in Aroostook and Washington 
counties, with a load of approximately 130 MW. The NMISA is responsible for 
providing an independent, objective and non-discriminatory administration of all 
transmission access, transmission information access, and related functions, and will 
monitor and operate the markets in Northern Maine for energy, ancillary, and other 
services. The NMISA administers the transmission systems of the investor-owned and
cooperatively-owned utilities in Northern Maine, and its members also include all 
municipally-owned utilities, generators, suppliers of energy, and large retail 
customers operating in the service area."    Northern Maine Independent System

I wonder how NMISA feels about losing its sovereignty to an agency that has no 
authority because the legislative beast of carbon zero has neutered their reasoning. 
What if the legislature doesn't like what the PUC study reveals? 
How can NMISA still claim to be independent with the legislature meddling where 
they should not be meddling,( energy rigging)
You are not doing the people of the NMISA any favors with this bill.
When will you recognize that everything you modify and manipulate regarding 
energy is a form of communism?
Chasing Carbon Zero is Futile.  Carbon is the Lifeblood of Civilisation.
