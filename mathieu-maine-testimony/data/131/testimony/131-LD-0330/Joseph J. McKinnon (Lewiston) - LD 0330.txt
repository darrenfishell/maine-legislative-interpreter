As a landlord and a citizen of Lewiston, Me I am concerned about the additional time and 
cost this bill would have on landlords that have been trying to keep their rent cost down. I am 
presently running my buildings below market rates for the Lewiston area, and it isn’t because I 
don’t want to make a larger profit, but I also don’t want to add additional cost to my good paying 
tenants. We all know that heating, electricity and maintenance costs have gone up considerably 
over the last two years.  Other costs have gone up as well, but not as much, those being Taxes, 
Insurance, Trash collection, Yard care, Plowing and Management. And in some cases, for 
landlords, we still have a mortgage to pay.
If this bill goes through and it cost a landlord a loss of an additional weeks rent, plus 
extra forms to fill out and to be served will add more to our losses at the end of the year and then 
we have no other alternatives but to pass our losses on to the good paying tenants that are having 
a hard time now paying their rent. I would support this only if the state would reimburse 
landlords for lost rent and damages done by non-paying bad tenants. There are plenty of them 
out there and we should not waste good taxpayer money on them.
Thank You,
Joseph McKinnon
