Capital Area Housing Association
LD 330
February 16, 2023
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee:
We are testifying opposition to LD 330.
My name is Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don. I am current President of Capital Area Housing 
Association, a landlord association in Augusta area. Currently we have 177 members 
and 44 (25%) of those members live in the same building, 35 of them (20%) own 1 
unit, 137 of them (77%) own 5 units or less. Most of our members like me have 
regular job or retired.  They mow the lawns, snow blow driveways, clean their 
properties, and do whatever property maintenance by themselves allowed by the law.
Most of evictions are due to none payment of rent. We are opposing this bill because 
it will extend the duration of the eviction process, more forms for landlords/attorneys 
to hand out, create more red tape in the eviction process possibly leading to hearings 
being denied on technicalities.
We urge you to oppose LD 330.
Thank you. 
Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don
President, Capital area Housing Association                                                                       28
