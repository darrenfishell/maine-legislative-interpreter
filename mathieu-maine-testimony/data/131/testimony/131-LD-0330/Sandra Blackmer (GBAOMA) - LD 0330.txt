LD 330
I would like to oppose LD 330 on the grounds that it would add more time to an 
eviction.  This would lengthen the time of an eviction and increase the cost to the 
landlord in loss of rent, utilities, damage, etc.  This would keep another tenant who is 
in need of housing from moving in sooner.  In my experience, once a tenant knows 
they are leaving, they no longer respect or take care of the property.  I feel the system 
of having Pine Tree Legal in the courts helping tenants understand their rights has 
worked well for years.  Why add further paperwork and time to the proceedings. 
Again, I oppose LD 330
