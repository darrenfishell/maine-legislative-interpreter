Testimony of Frank D’Alessandro, 
Maine Equal Justice 
In support of LD 330 “An Act to Ensure Legal 
Representation for Residents Facing Eviction ” 
February 16, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Judiciary. My name is Frank D’Alessandro, and I am the Legal Services 
Director of Maine Equal Justice. We area civil legal services organization, and we work 
with and for people with low income seeking solutions to poverty through policy, 
education, and legal representation. Thank you for the opportunity to offer written to you in 
support of LD 330. 
Maine Equal Justice supports LD 330 because evictions have enormous negative primary and 
secondary effects on those evicted and on the surrounding community. Furthermore, as numerous 
reports and sets of data unanimously endorse the right to counsel for those facing eviction, it is 
imperative that Mainers have a right to counsel for evictions. Mainers should not face the 
prospect of being thrown out from their homes without counsel to help them through the process, 
especially when landlords are represented by attorneys over 80% of the time} Our state is ina 
serious housing crisis, rents continue to increase, and the inﬁ'astructu1 ‘e and money that has been 
supporting many of our state’s most vulnerable is coming to an end. All of this indicates thata 
mass eviction crisis is at our doorstep? This bill would help mitigate that crisis and would ensure 
that all Mainer’s have a chance to meaningfully defend themselves against homelessness. 
“Eviction is a gender justice issue. It is a racial justice issue. It is an economic justice issue. It isa

children ’s rights issue. And it is a civil liberties issue.”3 
VVhat This Bill Does 
As amended this bill does three things that will assist tenants in to be able to access legal 
representation when facing eviction: 
l. It requires that a form notice be attached to a notice to quit to advise the tenant on how to 
access legal representation. 
2. It provides that a summons and complaint needs to be served at least 14 days before the court 
return date to allow tenants greater time to obtain legal representation. 
3. It requires judges to announce the availability of legal representation on the eviction return 
date. 
Why Maine Equal Justice Supports LD 
The current state of eviction proceedings. 
Nationally, only 3% of renters are represented in eviction proceedings while landlords are 
represented 81%, and when a renter does not have representation they are often unable to “make 
legal arguments, raise applicable defenses, respond to or raise objections, introduce evidence, 
preserve issues for appeal, or navigate the procedural obstacles of litigation?" When renter’s have 
no representation and so are unable to properly defend themselves, they become more likely to 
default. Landlords are aware of this “imbalance ” and for that reason they are more likely to “ﬁle 
meritless eviction cases” against tenants who do not have representation than. those that do have 
repr'esentation.5 VVhen a renter defaults in an eviction case, an eviction judgment is entered which 
then puts them on a tenant blacklist. This can cause problems ﬁom homelessness to death.6 As 
Supreme Court Justice William Douglass wrote, “Default judgments in eviction proceedings are 
obtained in machinegun rapidity, since the indigent cannot afford counsel to defend.”7 
In addition to the issues in court that arise ﬁ"om not having representation, not having 
representation also supports the “eviction machine” that suppresses and destroys tenant’s 
fundamental rights.8 A fundamental right in any court hearing is that anyone being brought to 
court must be properly notiﬁed that they must go to court. However, in 2018, a study in New 
York City found that every year thousands of tenants were not served or were improperly served

with notice of eviction hea1ings.9 Furthermore, courts are required to make appropriate 
accommodations so that individuals can be present for their hearings. Eviction proceedings in 
Maine are all done on speciﬁc days of the month, and so many times tenants without 
representation are “forced to choose between going to housing court and going to work-—a 
decision with negative ramiﬁcations no matter the choice.”1° Compare this to landlords who in 
the vast rnaj ority of cases do not have to be present at the court hearings because they are 
represented. The current “eviction machine” is fundamentally unjust. 
Evictions are on an unprecedented rise in Maine. 
When the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, in Maine, the number of evictions actions ﬁled 
decreased dramatically. But by the end of 2021 and 2022 the number of ﬁled evictions increased 
at an unprecedented rate and that trend has no end in sight. According to public data from the 
Maine Judicial Branch, from 2008 to 2019 the average number of evictions ﬁled across the state 
was around 5,552 per year. In that time the greatest increase or decrease from year to year was 
ﬁ'om 2018 to 2019—a 12.1% decrease —and ﬁom 2010 to 2011 a 8.4% increase. By the end of 
2022, Maine had nearly met its pre-pandemic levels of eviction ﬁlings with 4,965 eviction ﬁled. 
More wonying, the last two years have seen the greatest increases in ﬁled evictions ever seen in 
the state’s history. In 2021, ﬁled evictions rose 21% and in 2022 it rose another 27%. In other 
words, after 2020, when a moratorium on evictions was struck down by the Supreme Court, the 
number of yearly evictions ﬁled has increased by 1,762 or 55%.“

REDFlN NEWS (Jan 21, 2022), https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-rental —report—december~2021/.
April 2020 and July 2022,13 the eviction crisis we are in is only going to get worse. From 2001 to 
2018, “renter incomes grew by 0.5 percent” while “rents increased by 13 percent. ”14 The end of 
rental assistance and the unbridled rises in rental costs has led to at least 41% of tenants in Maine 
being “cost-burdened ” (spending more than one-third of their gross income on rent) and 20% 
being “severely ” cost-burdened (spending more than half of their income on rent).15 As of 2022, 
nationwide, at least 20% of renters are currently behind on payments. “ Add to this that Maine is 
somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 housing units short,” and that nationally there is “less 
housing available for rent and sale than at any time in 30 years,”18 and what we are left with 
is a recipe for disaster. The unprecedent rise in eviction ﬁlings are only likely to increase, and so 
it is the perfect time to ensure all Mainer’s receive representation in such a crisis. 
Evictions trap people in poverty 
Evictions are undisputedly a key contributor to trapping individuals and families in poverty. First, 
evictions make it remarkably difficult to maintain steady employment because evictions tend to 
be followed by a lack of stable housing. In Wisconsin, evictions led to a 20% increase injob loss, 
and in a 2-year period 42% of those laid off had been evicted. ” Second, because of tenant 
blacklists and because evictions can disqualify an individual from a variety of subsidized options, 
having just one eviction can lead an individual or family to remain unhoused. This is particularly 
of concern for renters with disabilities because of “a lack of accessible shelter options. ” 20A New 
York City study found that someone who is evicted is 16% more likely to apply for shelter the 
following two years, compared to just 3.4% for non-evicted individuals. Once unhoused, 
individuals experience signiﬁcantly higher rates of poor physical, poor mental health, and 
mortality, ” unhoused people are twice as likely to visit the ER,” and student attendance and 
learning are extremely hindered. ”

Evictions themselves have also been linked directly to a number of health and social effects. 
When a pregnant woman is evicted, there is an increase in adverse birth outcomes and a reduction 
in infant weight and gestational age at birth.” When mothers are evicted with children, they are 
more likely to stiffer material hardship, depression, and parenting stress.” Even years after 
eviction “mothers are more likely to be depressed, and report feeling less happy, energetic, and 
optimistic than their peers.”26 Evictions increase family violence. ” There is a signiﬁcant 
association between county level eviction rates and rates of sexually transmitted infections like 
Chlamydia and Gonorrhea. 23 Evictions have been linked to psychological trauma and have been 
identiﬁed “as a risk factor for suicide. ”29 Those evicted have 63% higher odds of losing Medicaid 
coverage, and getting prescriptions ﬁlled or storing prescriptions becomes extremely difﬁcult.3° 
Furthermore, for eviction filings that do not lead to evictions, it is estimated that it cost renters 
$180 in ﬁnes and fees.“ This effectively raises the cost of the rent by 20% in most places. 
Evictions effect Communities of Color and Women disproportionality 
Evictions are a racial justice and gender issue because evictions disproportionately effect people 
of color, women, and women of color. Black and Latino/a people “are more likely to be renters 
across income levels and are disproportionately represented in jobs with low wages, 
compounding the damage of these rental unaffordability trends.”32 For example, in 2019, while 
white households were renters 28% of the time, Black households were renters 58% and Latino/a 
were 54%.” Black and Latino/a families are twice as likely as their white counterparts to have 
little to no ability to make rent each month.“ Nationally, Black individuals constituted almost 
20% of all adult renters but were nearly 33% of all eviction ﬁlings,“ and four out of every ﬁve 
black renter lives in a county where landlords disproportionality ﬁle evictions against Blacks.“ 
Black renters face serial eviction ﬁlings (eviction ﬁled repeatedly against the renter at the same 
address) at a rate of 14.9% , Latino/a have a rate of 13.2%, and Asians have a rate of 11.8%. All 
the while whites only have a rate of 9.8% rate.” In general, women are nearly 16% more likely to 
be evicted than men.38 But, in particular, Black women are twice as likely then white women to 
have an eviction ﬁled against them,” they are more likely to have an eviction ﬁled against them

that is dismissed, and they are the group most harmed by the current tenant screening policies that 
blacklist an individual with even a single eviction. “ It is clear that that the “threshold for ﬁling 
against white renters is higher than the threshold for ﬁling against black and Latin[o/a] renters. ”41 
There can be no question that evictions are a racial and gender issue. 
Evictions effect children disproportionality 
Evictions are a children ’s rights issue. Renters with children are 17% more likely to be evicted 
than those witl1outchildren.42 Additionally, renters Without children who fall behind on rent have 
an eviction rate of 8%, but those in the same position With children have an eviction rate of 20%. 
This means that for eviction rates, having children is “equivalent to falling 4 months behind in 
rent.”43 Additionally, the increase in children correlates to an increase in evictions. A one percent 
increase in children in a neighborhood increases the neighborhood eviction rate by 6.5%.“ In 
neighborhoods where children made up 25% of the population 1 in 18 renters was evicted. In 
neighborhoods with 35% children, 1 in 14 renters were evicted, and Where children are 40% of 
the population, 1 in 12 renters is evicted. 45 Children as young as 4 months old have been 
evicted. “ 
Landlords oﬂen view children as problems. Young children can test positive for lead poisoning, 
which can cost the landlord thousands. ” In disadvantaged neighborhoods, parents often require 
their children to stay indoors, and this can lead to noise issues and property damage.48 Young 
Black and Latino boys attract the attention of police, which can lead to violations against the 
landlord.49 In larger cities, 15% of children have been evicted once by ﬁfteen years old. For Black 
children that number goes up to 19% and for Latinos that goes up to 17%, as compared to 11% 
for white children. ” For children living in “deep poverty” (living below 50% of the poverty line), 
29% have been evicted by age ﬁfteen.“ More and more children are being listed on rental leases, 
and when they are evicted that will stay on their record (blacklisted) for their lifetime.52 This puts 
them at huge disadvantage for future housing. 
Children that live with housing insecurity deal with enormous ramiﬁcations for their education 
and their future potential. Childhood evictions in urban areas is a powerful predictor of lead 
poisoning. ” 
A housing change during childhood can lead to half a year of loss in school.“ Children that are

forced to move three or more times generally have lower earnings, fewer work hours, and less 
educational attainment. “ Children with unstable housing “are more likely to be truant, and are 
more likely to drop out”56 and they “are at higher risk for developmental delay, decreased 
academic achievement, anxiety, depression, behavioral disturbances, and even death.”57 
Representation is need to protect these children. 
Legal Representation in Eviction Cases Provides Enormous Beneﬁt to Individuals and 
Communities and are Cost Effective 
Currently, there are ﬁfteen cities” and three states” that have started a right to counsel program 
for evictions, and the data from those programs show enormous beneﬁts to the tenants, the 
landlords, the courts, and the communities. In Cleveland, 93% of represented tenants avoid and 
eviction judgment or involuntary move, and the city saved nearly $5 million in 2021 as a result of 
the representation.6° In Columbus, landlords won 1% of cases with represented tenants 
(compared to 54% win rate against non-represented tenants), and even limited representation 
increased “agreed entries” to 40% ﬁ*om 15%.“ In Minnesota, 96% of fully represented tenants 
won or settled their cases and 80 % left the court without an eviction on their record. 
Comparatively, only 62% on unrepresented tenants won or settled their case, and only 6% left the 
court without an eviction record.62 Additionally, while umepresented tenants were four to ﬁve 
times more likely to face eviction by sheriffs, fully represented tenants were twice as likely to 
keep possession of their home and four times less likely to use homeless shelters.63 In San 
Francisco, represented tenants were three times less likely to default, they were half as likely to 
pay damages or attomey fees, 24% more likely to raise a defense then those without 
representation, and the number of eviction ﬁlings dropped 10%.“ For those that had to move, one 
year later, represented clients had found a new rental 74% of the time while umepresented tenants 
found new rentals only 43% of the time.“ In New York City, 84% of represented renters 
remained in their homes.“ In Massachusetts, the cost of evictions (including the costs that 
increase with healthcare, emergency shelters, education etc.) is estimated to be $63.03 million 
While the cost to represent tenants was $26.29 million. “ This meant that right to counsel in 
Massachusetts saved the state $36.73 million (this is conservative estimate) and every dollar spent

on eviction representation had a return of at least $2.40.“ In Maine, Pine Tree Legal Aid has 
represented many tenants at the Cumberland County Courthouse, and in 2020 eviction rates for 
those represented by Pine Tree were 51% versus 72% for those that were not represented.-69 
Generally, tenants are nineteen times more likely to avoid eviction orders and have success when 
represented, and “eviction orders have declined ﬁve times faster” where right to counsel 
programs exist.7° 
The effects of evictions, some of which are listed above, “can unravel the fabric ofa 
communjty ”71 and the “ﬁnancial burden on communities also goes up because the costs of 
providing shelter and related services, such as medical care, use of public beneﬁts, and police 
intervention for the homeless, increase. ”72 However, right to counsel for eviction cases can 
directly prevent much of the damage and costs associated with evictions. 
“Representation does more than just improve the chances of remaining 
stably housed. It improves outcomes for all tenants because landlords will 
be less likely to bring meritless cases, knowing that they will face an 
attorney in the courtroom. That saves communities money by avoiding 
the costs of shelters, homeless services, and job loss. The presence of 
lawyers also increases the legitimacy of the adversarial system for tenants, 
and helps identify and combat systemic inefficiencies and inj ustices. ”73 
Conclusion 
The simple changes to Maine law recommended in this bill will help insure that tenants 
have access to legal representation in eviction cases and the beneﬁts that ﬂow from that 
representation. Maine Equal Justice strongly urges the Committee vote ‘ought to pass’ as 
amended on LD 330. With an eviction crisis looming, or perhaps already here, and with the 
costs to individuals and society because of evictions, there is no reason Mainers should not 
have the dignity of representation in cases that may leave them without a roof over their head
