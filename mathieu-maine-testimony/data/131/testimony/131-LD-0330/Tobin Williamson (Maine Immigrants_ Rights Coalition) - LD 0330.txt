My name is Tobin Williamson and I live in Lewiston, Maine. I work for the Maine 
Immigrants' Rights Coalition (MIRC), a statewide coalition of almost 100 member 
organizations that work to enhance the lives of Maine's immigrant communities.
Upon first reading of this legislation and the amendment that has been published as of
February 15, it seems like legislation my organization would support. Members of 
Maine's immigrant communities often face difficulties navigating the housing systems
here for myriad reasons, be it language access, discrimination, or just not yet 
understanding the way the systems work. There are indeed organizations that try their 
best to help, but no doubt sometimes tenants slip through the cracks and face eviction.
By ensuring legal representation for residents facing eviction, as this proposal does, it 
is our hope the number of people who lose their housing might be reduced.
Thank you for your consideration.
