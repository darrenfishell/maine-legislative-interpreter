LD 330
I oppose LD330.  This is just another hurdle and delay making it more difficult to 
evict tenants.  Tenants already have lots of protections built into the system and Pine 
Tree Legal always manages find a way to involve themselves in the process.  Since 
the vast majority of evictions are completely legitimate, this will only serve to delay 
the inevitable.  Delay costs hard-working mostly small landlords precious resources.  
Since most landlords are not rich the financial impact of bad tenants and delayed 
evictions can be devastating.  No one is proposing a way to compensate Landlords for
these costs.
Additionally the interests of good tenants should be considered.  Bad tenants often 
make bad neighbors.  There is a shortage of housing for good tenants as well and 
delays in process keep apartments off the market.  The additional cost of further delay
will ultimately be reflected in higher rents.
The system offers plenty of protections and opportunities for representation already.  
Evictions are painful and expensive already this will make it more so.  Almost never 
are good tenants being evicted.  This is not in the interest of responsible hard-working
tenants either.
Ultimately I believe that the legislature is interested in helping with the homeless 
problem in Maine.  This will not help with that at all.  It will make it worse.
Thank you for your consideration.
