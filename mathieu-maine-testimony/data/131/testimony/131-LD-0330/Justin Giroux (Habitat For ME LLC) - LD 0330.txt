LD 330
I have concerns about LD 330, which does not seem to have been written yet. It 
seems to be picking sides in the eviction process, which is unfair. I'd argue both 
parties should be offered equal representation. This can be done by keeping the 
current system or offer representation to both parties. 
I'd remind you that evictions are usually done for good cause. I know we look to 
evictions as an absolute last resort. They are hard on both tenants AND property 
owners. Evictions usually cost property owners thousands of dollars due to legal fees, 
lost rent, damage to property.
