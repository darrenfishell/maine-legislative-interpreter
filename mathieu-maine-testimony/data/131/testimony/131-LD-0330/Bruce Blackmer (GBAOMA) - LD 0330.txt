LD 330
I am opposed to LD330. It would probably cause a delay in evicting a bad tenant. I have been
in the landlord business since 1972. I have never evicted a good tenant. Also sometimes a 
bad tenant causes good tenants to leave. I am sorry that I am not giving testimony in person. 
I am driving a school bus today. The regular driver is sick and there is a shortage of bus 
drivers. I feel the kids need me more than you do. 
         Thank You, Bruce Blackmer, Dedham, Maine
