LD 330
Iâ€™m writing in opposition to LD 330. I believe this bill will cause delays to the 
eviction process. That is a major  problem when there is a dangerous tenant or a 
tenant is causing damage to property.  There is nothing wrong with Pine Tree Legal 
offering aide to tenants, but we should not make the eviction process take even longer
that it already is.
