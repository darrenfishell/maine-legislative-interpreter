Public Comment Before the Committee on Taxation In Support of L.D. 1392 
Hannah E. King, Esq. 
April 26, 2023 
Senate Chair Grohoski, House Chair Perry, and members of Taxation Committee: 
My name is Hannah King. I am a partner in the Cannabis Practice Group of Dentons, a 
global law ﬁrm with offices in Portland, Maine. I have practiced cannabis law since 2015 and 
represent hundreds of clients in the cannabis space. I have been an active participant in 
legislative and regulatory changes to the medical and adult use cannabis laws and regulations 
since 2016. I was appointed to two terms on the Marijuana Advisory Commission asa 
representative of the adult use cannabis industry. I am here today on behalf of Mainly Holdings, 
LLC, which operates an adult use cultivation facility in Bethel, Maine to provide comment in 
support of L.D. 1392. 
The current tax structure for adult use cannabis is a 10% sales tax and a ﬂat rate excise 
tax of $335 per pound of ﬂower and $94 per pound of trim. Excise tax is paid by the cultivator 
on the 15"‘ of the month following the month the product leaves the cultivation facility. What 
this means is if a cultivator transfers ﬂower to a manufacturing facility on March 31, they pay 
excise tax on the ﬂower on April 15, whether they have been paid for the product or not. Excise 
tax is due any time that cannabis leaves a cultivation facility, so if it is transferred to multiple 
cultivation facilities, the excise tax paid multiple times. 
This structure has proven to have several unintended consequences that are harming 
small businesses. First, because the excise tax is a ﬂat fee on a commodity with a ﬂuctuating 
price, the effective tax is higher than what the legislature intended. Second, because excise tax is 
due monthly, payment often becomes due well before the cultivator is paid for the cannabis. 
Third, the tax structure, not the law is preventing the transfer of cannabis between cultivation 
facilities. This creates inefficiencies in the market, unnecessarily requiring all cultivators to have 
post processing capabilities rather than allowing companies with multiple cultivation facilities to 
consolidate post processing activities at one facility or small cultivators to transfer cannabis to 
larger facilities for post processing. 
The stated intent of the Marijuana Legalization Implementation Committee was fora 
10% excise tax. However, the mechanism for calculating the excise tax-—a ﬂat fee on a product 
with a ﬂuctuating price point—has result in a signiﬁcantly higher tax rate. As prices continue to 
drop, that rate is only likely to go up. In Colorado, for example, the price per pound of cannabis 
went from $1,721 in 2021, to $948 in 2022, and is now around $650. If Colorado had a ﬂat fee 
excise tax, that tax would, year after year, become a proportionately higher percentage of the 
wholesale price. At $900 a pound, a $335 a pound excise tax, with the other costs associated with 
cultivating a pound of cannabis in a legal market, means that cultivators are selling the product at 
a loss. Because the larger the cultivation the lower the cost of production, this will 
disproportionately harm small operators.

As of today, twenty-four states have legalized cannabis for adult use. Only ﬁve states 
have a weight-based excise tax, like Maine. However, Maine and Alaska are the only states to 
calculate that tax as a ﬂat fee on just two product types, with the weight-based tax being the sole 
tax on cannabis in Alaska. This is because this model fails to take into consideration price 
ﬂuctuations and price differentials between products. The best models come from Nevada and 
Colorado, which calculate weight-based excise tax as a percentage of the fair market value as 
determined by the regulators on a biannual or quarterly basis on a variety of different product 
types. LD 1392 is based on the Colorado and Nevada model. However, admittedly, these 
models are complicated and resources intensive. 
The majority of states charge a point of sales tax that is the percentage of the sales prices. 
Taxes in states that have implemented just a point of sales tax, range from 10% to 37%, with the 
average being 15.7%. It is common for states to recalculate their cannabis taxes several years 
into the market because the initial tax structures resulted in tax rates that were ill conceived and 
in practice were cost prohibitive and driving consumers to the illicit and less regulated markets. 
For states revisiting their tax structures, the trend is away from a model that includes excise tax 
on wholesale. For example, in June 2022, California eliminated its weight-based tax and shifted 
to a point of sales tax. 
While it is imperative that the current excise tax calculation be amended, the simplest and 
most efficient tax structure would be a point of sales tax on the percentage of the sale price that 
does not exceed 15%. This would keep Maine competitive with Massachusetts, New York, and 
Vermont and ensure that the state continues to bring in the tax revenues it needs to run the 
program. I would suggest, however, if you consider this model, that the higher sales tax be 
phased in over a number of years, while excise tax is incrementally phased out to avoid 
disruptions to the market from a one-time 5% increase insales tax.

Fair Market Value at Wholesale of Marijuana 
0 Pursuant to the Cannabis Compliance Board’s regulation, NCCR 1.095, Fair Market Value is 
defined as the value established by the Nevada Department of Taxation (Department) based 
on the price that a buyer would pay to a seller in an arm's length transaction for marijuana in 
the wholesale market. NRS 678B requires the Department to determine the Fair Market Value 
at Wholesale of marijuana. 
0 NAC 453D.236(6) ‘ sets forth that the Department will calculate the Fair Market Value at 
Wholesale using reported sales or transfers of each category of marijuana. 
0 The Fair Market Values at Wholesale are utilized by the Department in levying the wholesale 
excise tax imposed pursuant to NRS 372A.290 on the sale of marijuana by a marijuana 
cultivation facility. 
0 The Fair Market Value at Wholesale rates for each category will be posted to the Department ’s 
website and shall be used to calculate the tax on the Wholesale Marijuana Tax Return. 
Beqinninq January 1, 2021, The Department will set the Fair Market Value at Wholesale to the 
following:

$422, $1,515 $277 $51 $5.00' 
. $299 ' ' 
.'$300 $6.00 
The Fair Market Values at Wholesale were calculated based on marijuana cultivator transactions 
recorded by the Cannabis Compliance Board’s seed-to-sale tracking system from April 1 through 
September 30, 2020. Due to the limited number of arm’s length transactions, the Fair Market Value 
for the immature Plant category was calculated based on transactions over the period from April 1, 
2019 through September 30, 2020. The Fair Market Value for the Seeds category will be re- 
established at the previous historical price, while the sales prices will be monitored over the next 
reporting period. 
The next determination of the Fair Market Value at Wholesale rates will take effect July 1, 2021 and 
will cover transfers made between October 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. 
Methodology 
The Department determined that the excise tax upon wholesale transfers of marijuana can effectively 
be levied upon nine product categories: 
1 . Flower 
1 
Section 240 of AB 533 (2019) provides that the administrative regulations adopted by the Department of Taxation 
pursuant to chapters 453A and 453D remain in force and are transferred to the Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB) on 
July 1 and will be interpreted to apply until they are repealed. Consequently, NAC 453D.236 will remain in force until the 
CCB repeals that provision or the Department adopts a similar regulation. Sec. 122.5 of AB 533 (2019) codiﬁed as NRS 
678B.640 provides that the Department of Taxation shall adopt regulations to establish procedures to determine the fair 
market value at wholesale of cannabis. The Board shall furnish the Department with such information as the Department 
determines to be necessary to adopt the regulations required by this section. Currently, the Department is working on 
proposed regulation LCB File No. R108-20l which will replace NAC 453D.236 once adopted.

Trim 
The Seeds category was one of the original product categories from the initial Fair Market Value at 
Wholesale determination on July 1, 2017. However, by January 2019 the Marijuana Enforcement 
Division at the Department of Taxation recommended that the category be removed due to lack of 
transfers. The Cannabis Compliance Board has since requested that the Seeds category be re 
introduced. 
In order to comply with NRS 453D, the Department collected wholesale transaction records for the 
period April 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020 to establish the Fair Market Value at Wholesale for 
each category (with the exceptions for Immature Plants and Seeds outlined above). 
The recorded sales were standardized by adjusting actual sale prices to per-pound or per-unit 
amounts. Flower, trim, small bud, wet whole plants, flower approved for extraction, and trim 
approved for extraction are all valued by the pound. Immature plants, pre-rolls, and seeds are valued Small Bud

by individual unit. 
Sales that were labeled as internal transfers, samples, displays, promos, testers, or trials were 
removed as these are not considered to be typical arm's length transactions between buyers and 
sellers in a wholesale market. Standardized prices less than fifteen percent or more than five 
hundred percent of the previous Fair Market Value at Wholesale were removed as outliers 
Finally, the Fair Market Value at Wholesale for each category was determined to be the median of the 
standardized price per pound or per unit after internal transfers, samples/promos, and outliers were 
removed from the dataset.

Excerpt from the Urban Institution Blog, Cannabis Tax 
What are the different types of cannabis taxes? 
There are three main ways state and local governments tax recreational marijuana. 
Percentage-of-price. A percentage-of-price cannabis tax typically works like a general sales tax 
in that the tax is calculated as a percentage of the retail price, is paid by consumers in addition to 
their purchase at checkout and is remitted to the government by the retailer. However, like other 
excise taxes, a cannabis tax rate is typically higher than the goverrm1ent ’s general sales tax rate. 
State cannabis tax rates range from 6 percent in Missouri to 37 percent in Washington. Local 
cannabis taxes are typically capped by the state and set between 2 percent and 5 percent. The 
percentage-of-price tax is the most popular tax on cannabis. Ten states solely use this type of tax, 
and ﬁve states use it in addition to another tax. 
Weight-based. Alaska, Colorado, Maine, Nevada, and New Jersey use a weight-based cannabis 
tax. Tax calculations vary across these states, but in every state the cultivator (i.e., cannabis 
grower) is responsible for remitting the tax to the govemment, and in every state but New Jersey 
different parts of the plant are taxed at different rates (e.g., ﬂower is taxed at the highest rate 
because it is the most potent part). 
Potency-based. A potency-based tax is calculated based on the cannabis product’s level of 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in carmabis. This type of tax 
roughly mirrors state alcohol taxes where higher tax rates are applied to products containing a 
higher concentration of alcohol (i.e., a state’s per gallon alcohol tax rate is higher on liquor than 
wine and higher on wine than beer). Connecticut, Illinois, and New York use THC in their tax 
calculations. 
Additionally, state or local governments in 15 states levy their general sales tax on the purchase 
of marijuana in addition to their excise taxes. _
