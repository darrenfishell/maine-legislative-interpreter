To whom this may concern, 
Regarding LD 1392 and the change in how adult use cannabis excise tax is calculated, l Casey Raymond, 
representing Cannabis Cured, am in favor of this act. Having been involved in the adult use cannabis 
industry since its inception, we have seen a drop in wholesale price for all adult use products of about 
50%. The current market price of adult use unpackaged ﬂower, not for extraction, is between $1,500 
and $1,750 per pound. If the intent of legislature was to establish an excise tax around 10% of the 
wholesale price, they accomplished that goal initially. However, they failed to account for the 
ﬂuctuations in price that have occurred since adult-use cannabis was legalized. l believe this act helps to 
align the tax rate with the reality of these changing commodity prices. The adult use cannabis industry is 
difﬁcult to operate in, as there are many ”green taxes," costs speciﬁc to the cannabis industry, that can 
very easily result in death from a thousand cuts. From bank fees, increasing testing costs, sales taxes, 
security expenses, as well as 280e reducing deductible expenses, it's an uphill battle to operate ina 
sustainable, stabilized fashion. This change in excise tax would help adult use cannabis cultivators 
continue to survive and support those ancillary Maine companies into the future. Having been born, 
raised, and educated in the state of Maine, job creation and job growth is also an important side of this 
industry to me and Cannabis Cured. With that being said, we believe the passing of this act will allow the 
industry to continue to supply Maine with additional jobs at competitive wages. 
Thank you, 
Casey Raymond
