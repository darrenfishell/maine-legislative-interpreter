LD 1026
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
I am Beth Jordan, RDH , MS  from the town/city of North Berwick, ME and I am testifying in 
support of LD 1026. I support UMaine system commencing a program to educate Dental 
Therapists because in the State of Maine. We already allow a scope of Practice for this type 
of professional, but the closest program to earn this education is Minnesota.
The American Dental Association (ADA) has already developed accreditation standards 
(https://coda.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/coda/files/dental_therapy_standar
ds.pdf?rev=814980f6110140e7ba00659703cc3b3c&hash=81A3585FD5B1B478DA7D99065
A9B75DE) So in order to develop the program the university/program director simply has to 
follow the roadmap set forth by the ADA guidelines. Reimbursement models are already in 
place, there are no new procedure codes necessary. This should be a very straightforward 
program and the dental profession and the patients in need of services in Maine will all 
benefit from the development of this program and this provider as soon as there are new 
graduates. 
For the many reasons we have voted to allow this practitioner to practice in Maine, the 
patients/public of Maine, nor the dentists themselves, have not been able to benefit from 
utilizing these skills because there is no one teaching them and it is nearly unfathomable that 
a person from Maine would move to Minnesota or Alaska to learn these skills. Potentially 
there may even be students from greater New England and beyond that come to learn at our 
Maine program considering there are only two other CODA accredited programs in the US (5 
programs total).
