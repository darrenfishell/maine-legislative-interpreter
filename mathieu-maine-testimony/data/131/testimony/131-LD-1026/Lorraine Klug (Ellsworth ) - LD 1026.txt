 Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished 
members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I am 
Lorraine Klug from the city of Ellsworth and I am testifying in support 
of LD 1026.  I am the President of the Maine Dental Hygienists’ 
Association and I was also President in 2014 when the legislation for 
the dental therapist  passed here in Maine.  At that time, we were only 
the 2nd state to establish the dental therapist and now there are 14 
states across the country.  The biggest obstacle to becoming a dental 
therapist is obtaining the education and training because there are 
only 3 educational programs in the country which are in Alaska, 
Washington and Minnesota.  We have only had 2 dental therapists in 
Maine  in the past couple years and they both moved here from 
Minnesota. We are in desperate need of dental restorative services  
and with the passage of adult MaineCare benefits, they are sought 
after more than ever.  Our biggest issue…not enough providers.  The 
dental therapist is a way to provide more access to care and ease that 
shortage but we need the education and training and what better way 
than to establish a program right here in Maine.  
Thank you for your time and consideration.
