LD 1026
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, I am Tatyana O'Donnell, RDH, IPDH, 
MSDH from the City of Saco and I am testifying in support of LD 1026. I was a 
junior at the UNE back in 2014 when the dental hygiene therapist (DHT) was 
officially recognized by the state and was so thrilled that we would finally have a 
mid-level dental provider license available to provide access to individuals who are of
the underserved communities. Unfortunately, the way my life has gone I have not 
been able to uproot my life and complete the necessary training to become licensed as
a DHT, as this would involve moving out to Minnesota (closest schooling available). I
have been waiting so long for a school in New England to take on this project and get 
the curriculum passed for a DHT. I thought for a while that Vermont would be the one
to get it done first, however this did not come to fruition. I have since obtained a 
master's degree in dental hygiene with a Public Health focus, obtained my 
independent practice license, started my own independent practice dental hygiene 
practice, and try to serve those who are otherwise limited in their abilities to get 
quality preventive dental care, but I have been longing for years to complete the 
dental hygiene therapy program so I can do so much more! By establishing the Dental
Therapy degree program, you open up an opportunity for many current dental 
hygienists to expand their knowledge base and potentially reduce the overall cost of 
dental and health care to many patients across the state of Maine. By creating an 
educational opportunity to obtain the training necessary for DHT licensure more 
patients can be seen for minor restorative treatment, simple extractions, palliative pain
and referrals, and even more preventive educational opportunities that will keep many
patients out of the emergency rooms and quick-care clinics that cost the state 
thousands of dollars a year. With the University of New England declining the 
opportunity to educate the dental hygienists that are ready to take the next step (not 
only in ME, but also surrounding states!), we need the support of legislatorial 
representatives and the Educational and Cultural Affairs Commitee to make the 
mid-level dental provider a reality in our state and lead the way, as we always do, for 
surrounding states to make a healthier & happier community.
