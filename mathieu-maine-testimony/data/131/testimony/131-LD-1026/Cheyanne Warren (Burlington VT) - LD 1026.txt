Dental Therapists are improving oral health equity and access in areas where they are 
currently practicing. Creating a dental therapy program that can utilize some of the 
overlapping coursework required in other oral health programs such as dental hygiene will be 
essential to keep educational costs down. 
An educational program that builds upon the same accreditation standards that overlap with 
an CODA (Commission on Dental Accreditation) accredited dental hygiene program will also 
be important for establishing a career laddering curriculum. In addition, a program that can 
offer advanced standing for dental hygienists and or dental assistants will facilitate an 
expansion of services for patients who already receive oral health care at the dental hygiene 
school and allow some of the clinical education to be delivered at community-based sites 
such as federally qualified health centers. If appropriately structured, this type of career 
laddering curriculum will also cut down on the time it would take for a dental hygienist to 
complete a dental therapy training program. This will require a strong relationship between 
the sponsoring institution and the existing dental hygiene program collaborating with the 
dental therapy program. 
Establishing a dental therapy curriculum in Maine will address oral health access by supplying
oral health professionals who are educated and prepared to meet these disparities.
