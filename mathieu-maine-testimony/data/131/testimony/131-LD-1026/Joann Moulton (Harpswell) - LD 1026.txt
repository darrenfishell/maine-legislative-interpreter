LD 1026
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
I am Joann Moulton from the tow of  Harpswell and I am testifying in support of LD 1026. I 
have been a registered dental hygienist for 40 years in this state and sadly I have seen the 
gap widening between the oral health needs of our citizens and access to care. My belief that 
the best way to meet the oral health needs of the state is to have more midlevel providers of 
care. The best way to have more providers is to have a school in our state. Good oral health 
is essential for overall health and not just a luxury. There is a bidirectional correlation between
oral health diseases and many diseases of inflammation such as diabetes and cardiovascular
diseases to name two. Tooth decay is the number one preventable disease of children in the 
country and when untreated it progresses to debilitating disease and can be fatal.
If we did not have midlevel providers of medical care in this state such as nurse practitioners 
or physician's assistants, many of us would not have a medical home. The problem is the 
same for those in need of a dental home. There is an extreme need for access to oral health 
care that cannot be ignored any longer and this bill will help to increase the number of 
midlevel dental therapists in the state of Maine. 
Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.
