LD 177, An Act to Amend the Authority ofthe Public Utilities Commission Regarding Special Rate 
Contracts 
January 31, 2023 
Testifying: ln support 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology, my name is Kathleen Newman, submitting testimony in support of LD 
177, An Act to Amend the Authority of the Public Utilities Commission Regarding Special Rate 
Contracts. 
Central Maine Power Company currently has very few negotiated special rate contracts (aftera 
quick review l believe there are just two). We agree with the Public Advocate that giving the 
Maine Public Utilities Commission the choice to keep those negotiations confidential — not just 
protecting the final outcome with a protective order — is an option that could be valuable in 
ensuring the best possible deal for all other ratepayers who pick up the cost. 
Further enhancing the MPUC’s ability to withhold such information if there is a risk that it could 
be used against the utility in future contract negotiations, including special rate contracts, could 
save money for ratepayers and we encourage it's adoption. 
Thank you for your consideration.
