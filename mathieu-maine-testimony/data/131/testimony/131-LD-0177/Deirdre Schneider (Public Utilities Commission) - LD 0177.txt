Testimony of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 
In Support of 
LD 177, An Act to Amend the Authority of the Public Utilities Commission 
Regarding Special Rate Contracts 
January 31, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Energy, Utilities, and Technology (Committee), my name is Deirdre Schneider, testifying in support of 
LD 177, An Act to Amend the Authority of the Public Utilities Commission Regarding Special Rate 
Contracts on behalf of the Public Utilities Commission (Commission). 
The Commission welcomes having this explicit authority to deny or limit access to information, if the 
Commission ﬁnds that access will allow an attorney or party to use that information in future contract 
negotiation with a utility, including negotiations for special rates. However, we would like to offera 
small amendment to the language (see below). This amendment provides greater clarity that the 
Commission can bar access when the relevant information could be used in later negotiations and 
reduces the process on debating if there would or would not be an unfair advantage. 
Amend section 1 of the bill as follows: 
(3) The commission may deny or limit access to information if the commission ﬁnds that a party

I would be happy to answer any questions or provide additional information for the work session.
