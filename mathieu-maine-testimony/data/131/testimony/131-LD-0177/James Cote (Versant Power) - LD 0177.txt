VERSANT A POWER 
Testimony in Support of LD 177 
An Act to Amend the Authority of the Public Utilities Commission Regarding Special Rate Contracts 
Tuesday, January 31, 2023 
Chairman Lawrence, Chairman Zeigler, and members of the EUT Committee, my name is James Cote and I am 
here today on behalf of Versant Power to testify in support of LD 177, An Act to Amend the Authority of the 
Public Utilities Commission Regarding Special Rate Contracts. 
As the legislation clearly states, this bill allows the Public Utilities Commission to deny or limit access to 
information if a patty or attorney may be able to use the information in future contract negotiations with a utility 
to gain an unfair negotiating advantage. 
We believe that providing this additional authority to the commission is prudent and in the best interest of 
ratepayers. As you know, special rate contracts are designed to ensure that certain business customers may 
continue to operate and provide economic beneﬁts to their communities and the state. At the same time, any 
discount offered as part of a special rate contract is necessarily shifted onto other ratepayers and the utility is 
required to seek the minimum possible discount that will allow a business to continue operating, thereby 
minimizing any adverse impacts to other ratepayers.- 
The negotiations around special rate contracts are clearly sensitive and could have signiﬁcant impacts on 
ratepayers. Ensuring that no patty or attorney unreasonably gains access to conﬁdential information via special 
rate contract negotiations that can then be leveraged in any future contract negotiations is prudent and should 
protect the interests of all ratepayers. 
Should the committee have any questions, I would be happy to provide follow-up information or bring experts 
from Versant Power to the work session to provide further information. 
Thank you for your consideration.
