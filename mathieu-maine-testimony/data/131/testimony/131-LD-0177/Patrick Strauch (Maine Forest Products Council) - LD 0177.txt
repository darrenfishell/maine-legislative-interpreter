Testimony in Opposition to  LD 177 
“An Act To Amend The Authority Of The Public Utilities Commission 
Regarding Special Rate Contracts ”

Patrick Strauch, Executive Director  
 
Good afternoon , Senator Lawrence , Representative Zeigler  and members of 
the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology . I’m Patrick Strauch, 
the Executive Director of the Maine Forest Products Council. The Maine 
Forest Products Council is an organization representing more than 300 
members from all facets of the forest products industry. Members include 
paper mills, sawmills, loggers, truckers, foresters, panel manufacturers,  
biomass and pellet facilities and secondary manufacturers. We also have 
more than 8 million acres of dues payin g members.  
 I am submitting written testimony  today in opposition to LD 177, “An Act 
To Amend The Authority Of The Public Utilities Commission Regarding 
Special Rate Contracts .” 
 We understand that Maine PUC has the power to issue protective orders to 
prevent attorneys from disclosing confidential information that is received 
from parties during a proceeding. That being the case, we do not see how this legislation adds any further protection, and we are concerned that it may be used to disqualify  attorneys from representing future clients.  
 
As this bill could effectively limit our members from seeking the counsel of 
their choosing, the Maine Forest Products Council is opposed to LD 177.  
 
Thank you for  your consideration. I would be happy to provide answers to 
any questions the committee may have  for the work session.
