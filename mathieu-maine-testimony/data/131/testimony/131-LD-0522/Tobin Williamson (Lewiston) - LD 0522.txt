Tobin Williamson
Lewiston
LD 522
Dear Members of the Transportation Committee:
My name is Tobin Williamson and I live in the City of Lewiston. I am testifying 
today as an individual resident of Maine rather than on behalf of an organization.
I am writing in support of LD 522: An Act to Require That Motor Vehicles Be Clear 
of Snow When Operated on Public Ways.
New Hampshire ("Jessica's Law") and Pennsylvania ("Christine's Law") have passed 
legislation about this situation, with each law referring to someone who lost their life 
as a result. I would rather Maine not address this issue later by becoming the third 
state to have such a solemn reminder of the dangers that come with snow and ice 
flying off cars.
In a state that gets weather like we do here in Maine, this sort of legislation would go 
a long way in making our roads safer. It is illegal to speed, illegal to drive under the 
influence, illegal to drive distracted by a hand-held device. It should also be illegal to 
drive recklessly and put others at risk due to winter weather debris. Let's take action 
before we have a Jessica or Christine of our own to remember.
Thank you for your consideration.
