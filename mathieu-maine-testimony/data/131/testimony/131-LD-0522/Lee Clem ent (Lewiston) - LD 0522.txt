LD 522
I am in full support of LD 522. It is high time that the practice of allowing any vehicle
to accumulate snow and ice that can fly off and cause significant damage, injury or 
even death to other motorists be ended. As a retired LEO I have seen many instances 
of damage and injury caused by flying sheets coming from all types of vehicles, with 
some of the most egregious from tractor-trailer units. The idea that they should be 
allowed to prohibit passage of this common sense bill is truly unconscionable. 
NH passed a similar bill but not until a serious accident with significant injuries 
rallied public sentiment. We should be proactive in this instance.
