RE: LD 1423 – An Act to Increase the Limits on Awards for Compensatory and 
Punitive Damages Under the Maine Human Rights Act 
Dear Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, 
Please accept these comments in opposition to LD 1423 - An Act to Increase the Limits 
on Awards for Compensatory and Punitive Damages Under the Maine Human Rights Act, on 
behalf of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association (“APCIA”).  APCIA is a 
opposes the bill because of the impact it will have on premiums and on availability of coverage 
for some employers.  The bill proposes dramatic increases in caps.  An increase in caps means 
the potential for increased awards, attorneys fees and other elements of a claim under the Human 
Rights Act.  That will have a direct impact on rates.  It is difficult to quantify how much because 
the industry relies on experience as a basis for actuarial analysis and that experience will develop 
over the next several years.   
Accordingly, APCIA respectfully requests that the Committee vote LD 1423 unanimous 
Ought Not to Pass. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Bruce C. Gerrity
