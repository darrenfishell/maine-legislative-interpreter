TESTIMONY OF THE CIGAR ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA 
IN SUPPORT OF LD 1923 
“AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR LICENSING OF AND TAX COLLECTION FROM 
REMOTE RETAIL SELLERS OF PIPE TOBACCO AND PREMIUM CIGARS” 
May 17, 2023 
Senator Baldaccl, Representatrve Meyer, and honorable members of the Health and 
Human Servrces Commrttee, I am Chrrs Jackson from Mltchell Tardy Jackson 
Government Affalrs I am a res1dent of Bowdomham, and I am here today on 
behalf of the C1gar Assoc1at1on of Amerrca, Inc 1n support of LD1923 
Thrs b1ll has two portlons It amends T1tle 36 1n the Tax Code to provrde a path to 
compl1ance for onl1ne retallers of premlum crgars to collect and remrt exclse taxes 
on sales to Mame consumers, and, 1t amends T1tle 22 to be consrstent w1th those 
changes 
Thrs b1ll 1s necessary due to the fact that after the Wayfazr dec1s1on 1n 2018, and 
subsequent lmplementatlon, states started looklng to other taxes that could be 
rmposed on out of state reta1lers A few early states passed mandates for the 
collectlon of tobacco excrse taxes from onlme retarlers of premrum crgars and p1pe 
tobacco, but d1d not provlde thelr Departments of Revenue wrth the tools to 
lmplement the tax In add1t1on, there were statutory barrrers preventlng the 
compan1es from complymg 
Specrﬁcally, the mandates often sought to rmpose a tax, normally between a 
wholesaler and a retaller, on the transactlon between the onlrne retarler and 
consumer, wrthout changes to the tax statute Thrs proved unworkable for both the 
Departments of Revenue and the onlme retarlers CAA and the Premrum C1gar 
Coal1t1on undertook an effort to examlne all state tobacco excrse tax statutes and 
worked wrth the Federatlon of Tax Admrnlstrators Unrformlty Commrttee to crafta 
model leg1slat1on outlme to address these rssues
The model legislation, which has been adopted by the FTA Uniformity Committee, 
addresses four barriers that existed in nearly every state excise tax code in order to 
impose this obligation on online sellers of premium cigars and pipe tobacco 
The four barriers were (1) establishing the tax base, (ii) the constitutionality of 
imposing the tax (adding Wayfazr thresholds), (iii) ensuring the tax 1S only imposed 
once and on the retail transaction, and (iv) a path to licensure The model 
legislation has been enacted in six states so far. Maryland, Michigan, Indiana, 
Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado, and other states in addition to Maine are 
actively considering legislation The amendments to Title 36 remove these barriers 
so remote retail sellers of premium cigars (and pipe tobacco should Maine be 
willing to reconsider this prohibition to be in line with other states) can be licensed 
and collect and remit this tax 
Maine, however, has some provisions in Title 22 that need to be amended so as not 
to conﬂict with the newly added sections in Title 36 While there are some overall 
edits needed for consistency between the Titles, the main amendment is to remove 
section 22 MRSA 155 5-C relating to “delivery sales of premium cigars ” As 
currently written this provision with its accompanying regulations, does not 
provide the Department of Revenue with the proper tools to license and collect 
excise tax on remote retail sales of premium cigars 
Instead, this provision causes great confusion as “delivery seller” is a teim of art 
under the federal Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (PACT ACT) — but 
premium cigars and pipe tobacco (due to their very different usage patterns and 
almost umneasurable use by youth) are speciﬁcally excluded from the 
requirements and prohibitions present in the PACT ACT This bill would remove 
this provision so as to not have conﬂict between the titles and make other 
conforming changes so the two statutes would work together 
Importantly LD1808, sponsored by the Department of Revenue, seeks to make 
nearly identical changes to Title 36 as are present in this bill We have been in 
discussions with the Department and are working with them on that bill. It is for 
that reason we _]0lI1 in Sen Pouliot’s request to carry this bill over so we can work 
on the amendments to Title 22 once Title 36 has been implemented. 
Thank you for your consideration
