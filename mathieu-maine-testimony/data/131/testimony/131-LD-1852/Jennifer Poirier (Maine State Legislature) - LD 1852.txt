LD 1852 “An Act to Eliminate the Lodging Tax on Campground 
Sites and Revert to Using the Current Sales Tax 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation $9 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation, my name is Jennifer Poirier, and I proudly represent House District 70, which is 
comprised of Skowhegan. I am pleased to stand before you today to present LD 1852, An Act to 
Eliminate the Lodging Tax on Campground Sites and Revert to Using the Current Sales 
Tax. 
The greatest asset of Maine could arguably be its great outdoors. From its rocky, beautiful 
coastline, to the scenic, breathtaking views of Katahdin, Maine is host to beautiful landscapes 
where one can explore or seek the peace of nature. 
Camping is a long-standing recreation for not only those who travel from away, but for those 
who reside in Maine. Whether a weekend getaway, a vacation, or as a seasonal home, many 
people seek campgrounds to park and enjoy their recreational vehicles. 
As a child and young adult, my parents blessed me with the opportunity of spending my 
summers on Lake Wesserunsett. The campground was a place to form friendships, to exercise, 
and to participate in countless outdoor recreation activities. My husband and I carried on the 
positive experience and spent many seasons at the same campground with our seven sons. The 
experience gave our family a love of nature and the ability to recognize the value of Maine’s 
natural resources. 
In 2016, the Maine Legislature enacted a law to tax campers the same lodging tax as hotels and 
rooming houses, that raised the tax rate for camping to 9%. I believe it is time to revisit this 
decision.

Daily, weekly, and seasonal campsite rates vary greatly, depending on the location and available 
amenities. When the 2016 law passed, Campground owners were forced to assess the additional 
charge by raising their rates. A family who camps seasonally at an oceanside campground can 
easily spend over $5000.00 for the rather short season. The Lodging Tax at such a rate is 
approximately $450.00. This tax is in addition to the cost of the camper and its yearly 
registration fees. Some campgrounds also charge fees for septic pumps, water, and electricity. 
By lowering the tax rate attached to camping, we will lower the cost burdens and allow more 
people to enjoy the outdoor opportunities Maine offers. You may hear that lowering the tax rate 
will reduce tax revenues, but the beneﬁts far outweigh the costs. Every family should be able to 
experience the outdoors, for a weekend, a week, or for the season, like my family was able to. 
I respectfully ask you to support LD 1852. I hope the committee will give thought and 
consideration to this proposal and promote Maine’s motto, “Vacationland ” . Thank you for 
allowing me to present this bill. I would be glad to answer any questions you may have. 
Rep. Jem1ifer Poirier
