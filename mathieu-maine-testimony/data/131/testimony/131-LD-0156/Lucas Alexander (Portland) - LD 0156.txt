Testimony of Lucas, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Lucas. I am a 
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I know for a fact that most students including myself need this time to just not have a time to 
have fun. Also this will be helpful to let students just be free. When there is no free time 
students may act out and be disruptive. Having time to just talk and other things may save 
time by lowering the amount of time wasted by time taken from disruption due to inactivity.
As a student myself I use this time to learn about my peers within my class.
This way I can feel more open to talk to more people and freely communicate with them.
And that is why I think it is important to have a recess/ break time.
