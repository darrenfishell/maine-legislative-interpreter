Testimony of Maren Krovel, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Maren Krovel. I 
am a resident of Portland, Maine and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I understand that you and your partners in government are talking about the bill LD 156, and i 
strongly believe that this bill is so important. For one, studies show that if kids go outside at 
school, it gives them time to recharge, and have fun, in the middle of all the stress. It gives a 
chance to have a new perspective, or change your attitude toward your work.
Secondly, Fresh air is important for everyone, and a lot of kids don’t go outside a lot, which is 
really bad for you. Being cooped up inside for a whole day is not good and should be revised. 
You should make this bill a law, so that the future generations are healthy and 
familiar with the outdoors and how important it is. This opinion that I have, is shared 
by many other middle school students and teachers. 
In conclusion, this bill should most definitely be passed into a law, for the sake of the 
world and the  people in it. Please take time to consider this message, and I hope you 
have a splendidly wonderful day.
Fondest regards, Maren Krovel
Portland, Maine
