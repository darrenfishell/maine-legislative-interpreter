LD 156
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Millie Rich. I am
a resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I think that we should have time for break so we can have time to spend with your friends that
you don't have classes with. And if we are in school for 6 hours and 40 minutes  then we need
a little break in the middle of the day so we get a break from school. All kids need to have a 
little break in the middle of the day during school so they can have a little break to calm down 
if they are stressed from the work that they are having trouble with and they can stop thinking 
about it for a little while.
 I think why this should become a law is because every kid and teachers need a little break 
from doing their work so they can hangout with the friends that they don't have any classes 
with and they don't see them for the whole day so they should be able to have a longer brake
