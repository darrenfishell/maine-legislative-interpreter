As a 24-year PE teacher, I'd like to urge you to require outdoor recess time for grades 
6-8. I've worked with this age of students so I KNOW firsthand the importance of 
this! 6th-8th graders have lots of energy and hormones that are often best handled 
with FRESH AIR and EXERCISE! Recess also gives them a much needed "break" 
from the rigors of schoolwork, resetting their brains for optimum learning.  In the 
words of one of my students talking about physical activity, "it helps my body stay 
healthy and I need exercise because I'm usually on my phone a lot." THEY know that 
they need it, please give them what their mind, bodies, and spirits need!
