Testimony of Jake Braziel, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Jake. I am a 
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I am fine with school but we are inside for 6-7 hours and when you're at my age you 
have a lot of energy and we can’t release energy in a small classroom, so we need to 
go outside and have free space to do what we want.
This works for our schedule so I wouldn’t understand if it didn’t work with any other 
schools. We have good timed classes with recess included, we have a good carved out
time in our schedule right after lunch.
I want to thank you for your time and considering passing this law.
Sincerely, 
        Jake L. Braziel
Resident of Portland
