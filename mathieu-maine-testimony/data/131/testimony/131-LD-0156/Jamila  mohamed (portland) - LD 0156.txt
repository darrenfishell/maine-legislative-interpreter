Testimony of Jamila, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Jamila. I am a 
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I support this bill because my middle school has unstruchered school time and it works very 
well for both teachers and students.
Also , I think this bill is important to schools because kids can have a break from school work.
 Middle schoolers should have the time to do something that's not school related, and they 
can hang out with their friends and unwind for a period of time.
I hope you guys take this testimony into consideration to let middle schoolers have a break 
time for their mental health.
