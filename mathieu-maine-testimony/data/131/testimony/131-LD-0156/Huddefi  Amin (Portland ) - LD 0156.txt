Testimony of Huddefi Amin, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Huddefi Amin. I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
Having recess is good and having it gives you a break from work. When you go outside you 
can breathe in fresh air and you can play and have fun with your friends like when it is sunny 
and it is recess/midday break we go outside. This bill is good because it gives us something 
to do other than work like play, run around and talk with your friends. 
Also when it is snowing and raining and it is really cold we can just stay inside and go into 
rooms you can play inside when the weather is bad outside ever since we had midday 
break(recess) at king i had a lot of fun.  
At midday break (recess) works it gives us a break. It is also good for you to go outside in the 
middle . You usually use computers and do work on it. After a couple of classes you can go 
outside and have recess.
So I hope that when you read this that you agree with me and that we should have recess at 
middle school. It can be good for you and maly even be healthy. You can get vitamin D from 
the sun and also vitamin D can be good for your skin. Thank you for your time and for reading
this.
Many thanks
