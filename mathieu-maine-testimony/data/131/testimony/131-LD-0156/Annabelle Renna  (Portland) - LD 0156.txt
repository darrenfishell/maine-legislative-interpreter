Testimony of Annabelle Renna King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Annabelle Renna
. I am a resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I fully support this bill because of my personal experience of having unstructured time
in middle school.
 I believe that school should have unstructured school time because it helps students 
relax and prepare for the rest of the day by being able to focus. 
I hope that you will take my brief testimony into consideration by passing this law and I'm very
happy to answer any questions you may have.
