LD 156, An Act to Require Outdoor Recess Time for Students from Grade 6 to Grade 8 , would 
require that  every school administrative unit provide at least 20 minutes of recess to all students 
in grades 6 -8, at least 3 days per week. The bill defines recess as an unstructured physical 
activity, leisure, or recreational time.  
As indicated in Title 20 -A, §2(2), the control and management of the public schools shall be 
vested in the legislative and governing bodies of local school administrative u nits, as long as 
those units are in compliance with appropriate state statutes. This policy of “local control” 
provides communities with a stronger voice in critical decisions in how education is to be 
provided. It also means that the Maine Department of E ducation has limited or no authority to 
intervene in many situations.  
The school day in Maine’s public schools is already filled with what the State mandates  that they 
accomplish within the existing school day. Whenever a new mandate is enacted, there is always 
a trade -off, and school must choose to remove something else to make room for i t. Another 
option is for schools to extend the school day which is a complicated endeavor.   
We also know that recess provides many benefits to students . First, there are  the general benefits 
of physical activity such as a reduction in anxiety and stress. Additionally,  unstructured playtime 
allows students to solve problems , recover from disappointments, and make their own decisions 
about how they will entertain themselves.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 156 and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
