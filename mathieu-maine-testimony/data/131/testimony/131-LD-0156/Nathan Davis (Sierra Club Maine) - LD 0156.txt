Re:
Testimony in Support of LD 156: An Act to Require
Outdoor Recess Time for
Students from Grade 6 to Grade 8
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Committee On Education and
Cultural Affairs, my name is Nathan Davis, and I am testifying on behalf of Sierra Club Maine,
representing over 22,000 supporters and members statewide. Founded in 1892, Sierra Club is
one of our nation’s oldest and largest environmental organizations. We work diligently to amplify
the power of our 3.8 million members nation-wide as we work towards combating climate
change and promoting a just and sustainable economy. To that end, we urge you to vote “ought
to pass” on LD 156: An Act to Require Outdoor Recess Time for Students from Grade 6 to
Grade 8.
I’d like to make two sets of arguments in favor of this bill. The first set is straightforward:
Abundant research and expert opinion confirms the importance of recess in schools. The
American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement in 2013 (which it has since
reaffirmed) asserting that “recess is a necessary break in the day for optimizing a child’s social,
emotional, physical, and cognitive development”; “cognitive processing and academic
performance depend on regular breaks from concentrated classroom work”; and “peer
interactions during recess are a unique complement to the classroom.”

The federal CDC and the Society of Health and Physical Educators have observed that recess
“is an essential part of students’ school experience that contributes to their normal growth and
development. Recess helps students practice social skills (e.g., cooperation, following rules,
problem- solving, negotiation, sharing, communication), positively engage in classroom activities
(e.g., being on-task, not being disruptive), and enhance cognitive performance (e.g., attention,
memory).”

Springboard to Active Schools, a partnership among the federal CDC, the National Network of
Public Health Institutes, and Health Resources in Action, recommends that schools “provide all
students K-12 with 20 minutes or more of recess daily.”

The second set of arguments is less straightforward but more personal, and asks you to
consider what we actually want public education to accomplish. As I face down middle age, one

of the few significant regrets of my life is that I didn’t develop a deeper and fuller sense of my
physical capacities and limitations - that is, what my body can and can’t do - when I was
younger. It wasn’t until my twenties that I started taking physical fitness seriously, in part
because I was a bookish child and simply didn’t find myself in many environments where I was
encouraged to develop a deeper sense of my physical being. I have been blessed with relatively
good health, but still I frequently find myself wondering what other personal experiences I might
have collected or small victories I might have achieved had I understood at a younger age that
the development of one’s physical being is as important as that of one’s intellectual and
emotional beings. A complete education must develop all three. This bill is a step towards such
an education.
We urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 156. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
