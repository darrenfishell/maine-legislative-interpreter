Testimony of (Manuel), King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
INTRODUCTION
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is (Manuel). I am a resident of 
(portland) and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
SECTION 1
This bill is important because kids need to have fun. And staying inside all day is not fun and 
not energizing 
SECTION 2
Maine kids should have  time to go outside as a break because me as a kid I can not stay 
inside doing work all day with no break and I believe that kids should have some rest from all 
the thinking
CONCLUSION
I want the committee to support this bill because it will be really fun and energizing. Thanks 
for listening to what i have to say
