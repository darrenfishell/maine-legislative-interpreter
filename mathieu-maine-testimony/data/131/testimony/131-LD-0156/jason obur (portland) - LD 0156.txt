Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Jason . I am a 
resident of Jason and a grade 7 student at King Middle School.

Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”.

My teacher’s email address, if you have questions: masont@portlandschools.org
I think  we should  break  because you need fresh air and you should have time to spend time
with your friends and not have to just work for hours without having a break outside so that's 
why i think we should have a break and if it is too cold you should have a break indoors or if it
is raining.
