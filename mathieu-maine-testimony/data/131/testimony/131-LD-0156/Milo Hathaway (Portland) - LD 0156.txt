Testimony of Milo Hathaway, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Hello
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Milo Hathaway. I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I am glad to hear that recess is a priority on the state’s agenda, because it is a very 
important part of our school day. Leaving elementary school and starting middle 
school, one of my most prominent misgivings was the thought of abandoning recess 
time. Here at King however, I learned that we do have time outdoors during the day. 
This fact has had a very positive impact on my days here.
The CDC has found that recess time in the school day relieves stress and nervous 
energy, allowing for more calm, focused study time. Here at King, midday break fits 
easily into the schedule, and I believe that the school’s environment is made all the 
better for it.
I sincerely hope that this bill finds its way into law. I thank you for your time, effort, and 
commitment to Maine’s children, and I would be happy to answer any questions you may 
have.
