Testimony of khalid , King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Khalid ). I am a 
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
 I personally think recess is important because it gives students space and it's sort of a 
relaxing space for students to chill off and take a break from work. It's also a time 
where students can meet up with their friends since they may not have each other in 
classes. For example, I don't have some of my friends in my class. This is why recess 
is a time for me to spend time with my friends and have fun.
 Recess works just fine here in King and I think recess should be accessible for other 
students in different schools. I wouldn't want to be working the whole 7 hours of 
school with no break, so I feel very bad for students who don't have recess in their 
school.
In conclusion recess is very important and should be a thing in every school, it's a 
time where you can finally see your friends and have fun. It helps with anxiety and is 
very relaxing. The only time where I wouldn't want recess is when it's very very cold 
and raining. . Thank you and goodbye.
