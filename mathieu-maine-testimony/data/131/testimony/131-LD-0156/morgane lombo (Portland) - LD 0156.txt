LD 156
Middle schoolers should have breaks
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is (Morgane). I am a resident of 
(Portland) and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
SECTION 1
Personally, I think that school is very stressful so when we go to midday break I just feel calm 
and it gives me a chance to take a break from all the work and relax for like 20 to 30 minutes.
SECTION 2
Almost every kid can relate because school can be stressful and we wan to take a break from
working and just chill then get ready for more work cause school is hard.  I think it works at 
King's because we can all see that after 3 classes the students look like they are losing 
energy but after we come back from break we jump right at our work. 
CONCLUSION
I want the community to support this bill cause it might seem like something small but it can 
make a big impact on the kids. Closing.
