Before the Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
February 9,2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and other esteemed members of the Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs,< 
My name is Mallory Cook (pronouns she/her/hers), and I am the Director of Training and Early 
Educator Engagement at the Maine Education Association, and a certiﬁed English teacher and Building 
Administrator. I am here to provide testimony in support of LD I56: An Act to Require Outdoor Recess 
Time for Students from Grades 6 to 8. 
MEA represents approximately 24,00 educators across the state. In 2020, delegates to our Representative 
Assembly, our largest democratic body, resolved to support a 30-minute lunch and 30-minute recess for 
Pre-K-12 students. Our members know that active students, who are afforded a break from the rigors of 
the classroom, are better equipped to learn and problem solve. 
Students in grades 6-8 are between ll and I4 years old. According to the 2021 Maine Integrated Youth 
Health Survey (MIYHS), 43.4% of middle school students do not get the recommended 60 minutes of 
physical activity per day, while 35.1% reported being overweight or obese. 68.9% of students report 
three or more hours of screen time per day, while 71% spend at least two hours per day on social media. 
These statistics are startling. If We each think back to our own experiences at ll, 12, 13, or l4, we likely 
recall fond memories of playing foursquare, shooting hoops, or simply socializing with our friends, 
while phones were attached to walls, not our hands.I 
All of this is to say, our middle school students need unstructured, supervised time to be children. They 
need physical movement to improve their concentration, memory, and behavior; some may argue that 
students are given plenty of opportunities for movement in their physical education courses; however, 
only 64% of students reported having PE at least once per Week, while only 15% reported having PE 
daily. Furthermore, only 36.6% of middle school students reported involvement in an after-school extra- 
curricular opportunity, including sports. If the committee opts to move forward with this bill, students

would be granted an additional 60 minutes per week that could include opportunities for physical 
activity and movement.I 
Following the isolation and disruptions caused by the pandemic, our members have expressed concerns 
about students ’ executive functioning skills - namely their ability to regulate emotions, manage 
behaviors, and solve problems. A 2021 study of 7, ll, and 14 year oldsrevealed that physical activity 
was linked to emotional and behavioral regulation in middle childhood;2 while our approach to helping 
students attain or enhance these skills will be multi-pronged, building time for movement and 
unstructured play during the school day will certainly help. 
Even if students opt to use this time socially, they will continue to develop soft skills that have been 
hijacked by technology and the pandemic. They need the opportunity to build community outside of 
h. 
t eir coursework and outside of their cellphones. They deserve a break. They deserve the opportunity to 
be children. 
Should the committee move forward with this bill, there will certainly be logistics that have to be 
explored by middle schools to ensure time is built into the schedule and that space is available; we 
believe the beneﬁts on student physical health, executive functioning, and academics far outweigh those 
challenges, so we hope districts will make every effort to overcome them. 
Thank you for your time, and l’m happy to answer any questions you may have.
