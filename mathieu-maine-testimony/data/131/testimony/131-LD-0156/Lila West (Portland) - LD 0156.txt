Testimony of Lila West, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Lila West. I am a
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
At King Middle we have recess but I have some friends who don’t have recess and it is a 
challenge for them.
As a student, not having time to take a brain break and talk with friends is really difficult. This 
relates to the bill because recess is important and is a way to take a break from learning.
This bill is important to me because if I didn’t have unstructured time during the school day I 
would have a really difficult time trying to focus in class.
I understand that it must be challenging to make a schedule already so it must be even 
harder to add in recess or break time. But, this bill still needs to be passed so kids have 
unstructured time in the day.
My opinion matters because I am a student who has experienced recess and knows the 
benefits of getting a break in the day. Recess works really well at King Middle and we get our 
energy out during the day. This is important for other students, too.
I want you to support this bill because it is important for students to get breaks during 
the school day and have social-emotional learning, not just academic. Thank you for 
your time, I am happy to answer any questions that you may have.
