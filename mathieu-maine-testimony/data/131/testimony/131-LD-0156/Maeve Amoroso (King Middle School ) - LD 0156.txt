Testimony of Maeve Amoroso, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Maeve. I am a 
resident of Portland Maine and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
As a middle school student every day we have 7 hours of sitting in a classroom. When I sit in 
class for 7 hours a day it's very hard to focus when you can't have a break. This bill is 
important to me because students need time to take a break for work and chill just for 20 
minutes. 
I think this bill will work for Maine because all kids will be more focused at school 
and work better in class. My opinion matters because I am a student and I know how 
it feels to be in a class for 7 hours straight.  
That's why I think we should have outside time everyday.
