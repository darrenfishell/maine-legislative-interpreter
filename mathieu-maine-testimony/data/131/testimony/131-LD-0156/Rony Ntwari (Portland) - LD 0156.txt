               Testimony of Rony Ntwari, King Middle School
                                 In Support of LD 156
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Rony Ntwari. I 
am a resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
Every kid/teenager needs outdoor recess, because imagine spending 20 minutes at 
lunch and most of the time you're waiting for your food and then, go back to the 
classroom and sit for 2 hours. Every school needs outdoor recess to breathe, play and 
exercise.
This would work perfectly for both teachers and students as it is a win win for 
everybody. First of all, teachers would have time to prepare for their class after recess 
or have a breath of fresh air. Second of all, students would have time to play with 
each other.
To conclude, outdoor recess should become a law in our town so that every student 
can have a breath of fresh air and teachers can be fully prepared for the lesson or also 
have a breath of fresh air
