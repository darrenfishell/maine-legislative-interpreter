Testimony of Jaylena Desok, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is (Jaylena Desok). 
I am a resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
First reason :: my first reason on why I support this bill is because I don’t wanna just sit 
around all day for 7 hours. I wanna socialize with my friends and other people . I also wanna 
get all my energy out so when I get back from being outside I won’t be all moveable .
 
Second reason :: my second reason is that if i’m sitting all day doing work i’m gonna be very 
tired and my brain is gonna be tired. 
My conclusion :: is that all middle schools should have recess no matter what .
