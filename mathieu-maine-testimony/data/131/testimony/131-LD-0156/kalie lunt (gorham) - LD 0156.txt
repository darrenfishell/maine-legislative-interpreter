Testimony of Kalie Lunt, Gorham, Maine
In Support of LD 156
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on
Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Kalie Lunt. I am a resident of Gorham Maine and 
a parent at Narragansett Elementary School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156 “An Act to Require Outdoor Recess 
Time For
Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”.
My children are still in elementary school, but it won't be long before they're middle school 
age. The reason children need recess are endless, but here are a few of my favorites: 
VITAMIN D! Mainers are the most susceptible to a vitamin D deficiency as it is. 
Taking away outdoor recess would rob them of a chance to soak in the sun and all of 
the benefits vitamin D can offer us. 
ELECTRONICS! Today's world has children sucked into their devices more than 
ever before. A forced break/breather from these devices can only offer beneficial 
outcomes. 
EXERCISE! It is a well known fact that childhood obesity is a major issue. Any little 
bit of movement can help with this. 
TAKING RISKS! Children need to take risks. It boosts confidence, teaches lessons, 
and shows students and teachers the things they're capable of when they're given 30 
minutes of freedom and creativity. 
MENTAL HEALTH! The pandemic has effected mental health in human's as a whole
but this age group in particular has been hit hard. Fresh air, nature, running, climbing, 
etc. can offer 30 minutes of reprieve from the stresses these kids are faced with on a 
daily basis inside and outside of the classroom. 
These reasons are just the tip of the iceberg in why it is IMPERATIVE for these 
children to GET OUTSIDE and/or GET A BREAK from their regimented days. 
THEY ARE CHILDREN, please remember that in making your decision. 
Thank you to the co-chairs and committee members for your time and commitment to
Maine's children.
