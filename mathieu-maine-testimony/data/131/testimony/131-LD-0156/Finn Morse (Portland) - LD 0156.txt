Testimony of Finn, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Finn. I am a 
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I think that this bill is very important to children for many reasons, especially as a 
break time. I am a student at King Middle School and to me recess is a good break 
time in the middle of the day, a time for me to socialize with my friends and forget 
about classes, so I can refocus and prepare for the rest of the day.
Also this bill is very important because the students need this very badly, and I know 
that from my own experience. And at King this works very well so I know that all 
student would be positively effected from this, like we are here with at a school with a
recess.
I am supporting LD 156, and that is because it is a good break time for student, a 
good time to socialize with other students, and it is a very important bill in general. 
Me and all the student would like to thank you for your time.
