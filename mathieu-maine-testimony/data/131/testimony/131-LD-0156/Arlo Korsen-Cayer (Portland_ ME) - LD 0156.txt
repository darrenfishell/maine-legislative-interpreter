Testimony of Arlo Korsen-Cayer, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Arlo. I am a resident of Portland 
and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I think that all students, including myself, should have time in the middle of the day to
socialize, exercise and have fun in general. I know that if I don’t have a break in the 
middle of the day, I’ll be less efficient and would probably act out more. 
My school (King Middle school) already has a break in the middle of the day and I 
think many people at my school could not imagine life without it. Many schools in 
Maine don’t have a break in the middle of the day, making them less structured.
I truly believe that Maine schools would be better with recess, making the students 
happier to go to school, and happier to learn.
Sincerely Arlo Korsen-Cayer
