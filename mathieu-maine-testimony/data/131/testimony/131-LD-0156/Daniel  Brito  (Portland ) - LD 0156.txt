Testimony of Daniel Manuel Brito, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Daniel. I am a 
resident of Portland  and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I really want recess because it helps my physical skills. For example if I play soccer I would 
get better at soccer and if I run around I would get faster for track there so many different 
things that we can do that would help us.  
 
It would really help the kids that don't like to stay inside all school time or kids that are having 
a bad day and they just want to have some fresh air.
 
I just want other middle schools to have recess because it would be helpful kids that don’t like
to be in a class for the whole school time and other kids who just want some fresh air to get 
ready for other classes.thank you so much for your time and if you want so question you can 
email my schoolteacher@Portland,Have a nice day.
