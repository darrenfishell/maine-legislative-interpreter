Testimony of Brinelle, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
INTRODUCTION
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Brinelle Finunu Kubelo . I am a 
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor Recess 
Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”.
SECTION 1
 
I should have recess to play football with my friends and to talk with them.
SECTION 2
Because we need time to rest a little bit from work. 
YES. Yes but it depends on the school if the students are responsible yes.
CONCLUSION
I think we need to rest from work because when you study you rest and go back to 
work; it is just to take a little break from work.
Thanks for taking your time to read this and I really hope that this helps with this 
information.
