TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 156  
 
AN ACT TO REQUIRE OUTDOOR RECESS TIME FOR STUDENTS FROM GRADE 6 TO GRADE 8  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Eileen King, deputy executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine Schoo l Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association in opposition to L.D. 156.  
 
School Board members and superintendents sup port getting students outside for recess , but oppose this bill 
because  it should be a local decision based on local cir cumstances.  
 
This bill would require 20 minutes of outdoor recess, no fewer than 3 days a week  for students grade 6 to grade 8 . 
 
Due to the variety of grade configurations at different schools, the need to schedule students in an d out of classes, work 
around lunch schedules and consider the size of the facility and what school districts can accommodate, Superintendents 
recommend that this should be a goal , but should remain a local decision.
