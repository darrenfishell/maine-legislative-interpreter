Testimony of Tin Thai, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Tin Thai. I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I think that all middle schools should have recess. Because I personally would like to 
go outside and hangout with my friends. I can’t imagine not having the 20 minutes of 
each school day to go outside and play with my friends. If my school did not have 
recess I would have not been able to build a strong community of friends that would 
help me and support me when I’m in need.
The second reason why I think that all middle schools should have recess is because 
kids can get fresh air, they could build new friendships, would give kids a thing to 
look up to, would give kids a break to socialize. It would also make Maine a stronger 
community with trust and friendship.
That’s why I think middle schools should have recess for kids to make bonds, build 
stronger connections, run around, be free, relieve stress and most importantly have 
fun. This is why I think all middle schools in Maine should have recess.
