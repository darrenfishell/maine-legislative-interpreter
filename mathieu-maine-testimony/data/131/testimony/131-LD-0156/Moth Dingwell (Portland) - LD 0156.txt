Testimony of Moth Dingwell, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Moth Dingwell. I am a resident of 
Portland, Maine and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
Personally I think that this should become a law. I really enjoy going outside or having a break
in the middle of the day, because it gets my energy out and helps me focus better in class.
This bill is important to me and my class because we go out everyday and it definitely makes 
a difference. 
I understand that it's hard for teachers to create schedules, but it also helps teachers because
their kids aren't disruptive in class. 
My opinions matter because I've experienced this schedule for two years now and it's helped 
me alot, and these past two years it's always worked for the king. 
In conclusion, this bill should be passed because it helps kids and teachers. And thank you all
so much for your time.
