Testimony of Norah Neuner, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Norah Neuner. I am a resident of 
Portland  and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
This is an important bill to me because I need a break from school and sitting down 
all day. I also like to go outside because it's really good for your brain development 
because if you work your brain all day and you don't get a break then it will be harder 
to focus. 
When kids' brains are growing they need to move around and get their energy out so 
that they can focus. Also a part of brain development is socializing and if you are 
stuck inside in a classroom you can’t socialize with anyone and your brain will 
develop slower.
In conclusion you should let kids have a break and go outside because it’s good for 
their brain development and mental health and it’s easier for the kids to focus and 
teachers to teach.
