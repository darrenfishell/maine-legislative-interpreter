Testimony of Liam Kimball & Colin De Bree, students of Lincoln Middle School
In Support of LD 156
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs. Our names are Liam Kimball and Colin De Bree. We are residents of 
Portland and 6th grade students at Lincoln Middle School.
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156 “An Act to Require Outdoor Recess Time for students 
from Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
We are 6th graders just coming out of elementary school. We are used to having 30 minutes of recess every 
day and now since we haven’t had much outside time this school year, we have a lot of energy going into 
the afternoon. Teachers hate when we have lots of energy and they don’t realize that we need longer than 
10 minutes recess to get all our energy out.  We are used to having lots of energy and then getting it all out 
because of a 30-minute recess and 30-minute lunch, now we have 15-minute lunch and 10-minute recess. 
Some kid’s behavior at Lincoln is not very good. It may be because they have so much energy. If Lincoln 
wants them to act better, they might just have to add longer recess. In elementary school we had lunch, 
recess like normal, but we also had other outdoor activities such as, garden, outdoor art, gym, outdoor 
reading and more.  This is why we want to have more time for recess and outdoor activities. 
We feel that it will be important to all schools to have at least 30 minutes of outdoor time every day. 
Thank you for your consideration and we hope you support this bill for all Maine Middle School kids.
Thank you for your time and commitment to Maine’s children
