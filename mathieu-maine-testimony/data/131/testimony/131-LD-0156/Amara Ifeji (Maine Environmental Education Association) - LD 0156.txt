RE: Support of LD 156, An Act to Requir e Outdoor  Recess Time for  Students fr om Grade
6 to Grade 8
Dear Representative Brennan, Senator Raf ferty, and honorable members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 156, An Act to Require
Outdoor Recess Time for Students from Grade 6 to Grade 8, on behalf of the Maine
Environmental Education Association's 2000+ members and supporters. For 40 years, the Maine
Environmental Education Association has worked to enhance and amplify the ef forts of
individuals and or ganizations to build environmental awareness, appreciation, understanding,
and action in Maine.
Maine is a national leader in environmental education and outdoor learning, which has many
benefits for students and is a powerful tool for building environmental connections. A recent
analysis of environmental education research by Stanford University found that students who
participate in outdoor education score significantly higher on measures of critical thinking.
Perseverance, self-confidence, motivation, and leadership are only a few skills students report
gaining and are crucial in developing the next generation of problem solvers and civic leaders. In
addition to gaining these skills, regular time outdoors leads to better health and fitness, mental
health benefits, better sleep, and a longer life span.
While the benefits of outdoor learning are numerous, too few students today have the
opportunities to engage with the environment due to several barriers. The state has a chance to
ensure that more Maine students can reap the benefits of outdoor education by passing LD 156 –
An Act to Require Outdoor Recess Time for Students from Grade 6 to Grade 8. To promote the
engagement of Maine youth in the beautiful natural world the state has to of fer, and thus
contribute to building the next generation of Maine’ s environmental stewards, I encourage you to
support LD 156.
Sincerely ,

Amara Ifeji
Director of Policy
Maine Environmental Education Association
