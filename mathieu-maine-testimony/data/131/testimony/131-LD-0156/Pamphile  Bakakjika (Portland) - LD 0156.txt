Testimony of Pamphile  Bakajika ), King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
INTRODUCTION
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is (YOUR NAME). I am a resident of 
(Portland ) and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
SECTION 1
I think this should be a law because we go to school for 7 hours learning so the least we can 
get and a 30 min free time/ recess and some people need to talk to their friends that they 
don't see after school. 
SECTION 2
Recess works at king because kids need time to be kids with no one telling what to do . And 
not everyone wants to talk to each other at lunch. That's why we need recess .
