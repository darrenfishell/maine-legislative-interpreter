Testimony of Amelia MacDonald, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Amelia MacDonald. I am a resident
of Portland  and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
 I think that having outdoor recess for students is important because during the six hour 
school day it is important for students to get fresh air and be able to run around and talk with 
their friends .
 The second reason is that students need a break from school work even if it is just for
20 minutes, which can still make a big impact on students' learning and concentration.
There are several studies proving that recess is beneficial for a student's learning.
C. I think that schools grade 6 through 8 should have recess because it will benefit 
their learning and it will let them get fresh air. Thanks for considering the above. I am
happy to answer any questions you may have.
