Testimony of JohnR, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is JohnR. I am a resident of Portland 
and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
As a middle school student I believe that schools should allow recess for their 
students. Students have to work all day and then have homework after school. It 
would help to have breaks for the students.
I think that students should have recess but I understand that it could be challenging to
make a schedule around recess. I think there are challenges around recess and as such 
it could take some time but it's worth it.
I honestly think students should be allowed to have recess and that you make this bill into a 
law.
