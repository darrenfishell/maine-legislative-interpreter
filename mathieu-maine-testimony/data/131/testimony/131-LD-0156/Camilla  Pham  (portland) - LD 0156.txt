Testimony of Camilla King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Camilla Pham. I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I think all schools should have a midday break\recess because kids get to meet new 
people and make new friends.Mid day break has helped me make new friends and 
communicate with other kids. Midday break may not be long but it's enough to give 
me and other kids a break from learning and I just get to relax  and to get out there 
energy . 
School should have a midday break. It has helped the king so maybe it will help other schools
and kids. It has helped kings have calmer kids because they get to go  outside and they get to
release  energy  so when kids go to class they will become calmer instead of being full of 
energy. It has also helped the king build a stronger community because kids get to hang out 
with each other and get to know each other. It could also help kids look forward to going to 
school because they get to meet with friends and go outside. This could be very good for kids
who don't have class with their friends. It could help them connect with each other. School 
expects kids to be able to sit still and stay calm for 6 hours and 40 minutes a day. kids need 
to get energy out so if you just take 25 minutes out of a day it could help kids a lot. It could 
make your school a better place for kids. Kids might enjoy going to school more just because 
of that break. Coming from my own personal experience, that break has made me enjoy 
school more.
Thanks for reading this and hearing me out.
