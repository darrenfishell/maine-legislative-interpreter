Testimony in Support of LD 156
An Act to Require Outdoor Recess T ime for Students from Grade 6 to Grade  8
Good afternoon Sen. Raferty, Rep. Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural
Affairs Committee. My name is Angela King, and this testimony is on behalf of the Bicycle
Coalition of Maine.
The Bicycle Coalition of Maine is the statewide organization that advocates for bicyclists
and pedestrians. We work to make Maine better and safer for bicycling and walking to
encourage active transportation, which improves environmental and public health.
Through our education programs, the Bicycle Coalition works with schools to teach safety
skills and awareness when walking and riding a bicycle. These programs encourage
healthy, lifelong outdoor activity.
The Bicycle Coalition of Maine supports LD 156, as we are part of coalitions throughout
the state that work to improve public health. As a member of the Maine Obesity Advisory
Council, one of our council recommendations to the state is physical activity for youth.
Physical activity outside is a key component of healthy lifestyles for children. Students of
all ages need to have time outdoors everyday to strengthen both their physical and mental
health. All schools need to allow students to be outside for some time during a school day.
A life-long commitment to an active and healthy lifestyle often begins with a passion for
being outdoors, and we believe that the school recesses can play a vital role in fostering
that passion.
For these reasons, we urge the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee to support LD
156.
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine.
Sincerely,
Angela King
Advocacy Manager
Bicycle Coalition of Maine
