Testimony of John payer, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is John payer. I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
Most middle school students have to stay inside for 6 ½ hours without any physical 
activities and it is really unhealthy  for kids and teenagers so I think this bill will 
really help.
I think this bill will really help out because it is unhealthy for kids to be inside for 6 ½  hours 
and I really think this bill should be approved and I think my opinion and other people's 
opinion really matter. It really works here at king middle and works with our schedule. I think it
should workout for other schools in maine    
 
In conclusion I think this bill should be approved because students should have the time to let
out energy and could be a time where kids could be really social and kids should learn how to
have social skills to get through life.
