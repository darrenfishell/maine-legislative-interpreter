Testimony of Ellis J-H, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Ellis J-H. I am a 
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
One reason this is important is because we are in school for 6+ hours so there is a 
need to take time outside since it's tough being outside every day.
Also it should be mandatory since the children here will be much more engaged in 
learning if they can get their energy out. Also kids need free time or they will feel 
they are too controlled.
There are so many various reasons why this bill is important, and all are good so its 
very important that this gets passed.
