Testimony of Thomas King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Thomas. I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I fully support this bill cause people could not be fit and it would be very hard for 
them if they don't have outside time or time that they can relax and cool down before 
going to other classes and they should let kids and when the kids go outside they can 
be calm when they come back inside the school to go to their next class then the 
teacher can be calm and then it would be good for the teacher and students 
Kids should go outside because they need fresh air and if they don't get fresh air they 
can be lazy and then when they go outside they would be happy to run around and 
have fun because they could talk to their friends and play with their friends
This bill is very important because if the kids don't go outside their brains won't be 
ready to listen and they could no be able to do their work since they didn't get fresh 
air or get to hangout with their friends
This is why i support my bill because all kids should go outside and get to hangout 
with their friends
