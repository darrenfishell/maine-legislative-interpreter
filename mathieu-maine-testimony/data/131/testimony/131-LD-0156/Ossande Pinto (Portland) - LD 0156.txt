Testimony of Ossande Pinto, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Dear,
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Ossande. I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
As a student I really don't feel good staying indoors the whole time. It makes me feel 
uncomfortable and the bill would let me have a break. I was once in my class and I felt like I 
needed a little time to have some fresh air, and with this bill it will help me a lot.
This bill is important to me because then it would help me concentrate and be more 
comfortable in class.
Having no recess means no social activity, no social activity means not having time to
enjoy with your friends and that could really make you feel uncomfortable and cause 
some brain damage. This recess bill is really important because it would help the 
student learn better and feel better. Recess really works at king and I think it would 
help other middle schools too.
Again having recess can really help a student’s brain and it makes the student feel better
