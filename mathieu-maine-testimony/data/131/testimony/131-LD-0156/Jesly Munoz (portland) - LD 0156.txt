Testimony of Jesly munoz, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Jesly. I am a 
resident of Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
I think I need recess because that's where I talk to my friends and we talk about our 
day and about what classes we have next and sometimes me and my friends we walk 
around and it really takes some of your energy.
I think this bill will work  because I think most kids want recess if they don't have it 
because maybe they don't have friends in their class so they can see them for lunch or 
recess. Recess here at King Middle School works because we go outside and hangout 
with our friends and talk to them.i think it would work at other schools also because 
they also probably want to  interact with their friends so they could talk about their 
day and stuff.  
I really hope This law passes because it would be good for other schools and they 
wouldn't get to talk more with their friends if they don't have them in any classes and 
I feel like having no recess is really boring because you're in school for like 7 hours  
And if you don't speak English you might be able to talk to your friends in another 
language.
