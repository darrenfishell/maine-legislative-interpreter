Testimony of (Jordan or jo), King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
INTRODUCTION
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is (Jo or Jordan). I am a resident of 
(Portland M) and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
SECTION 1
Having a break is good because it provides a break for the students and  they also get 
tired because they are all human and they all need a break too.
SECTION 2
Break is important because sometimes students can be bored or upset with a teacher 
or a colleague so break is good because it also helps you to relax.
CONCLUSION
I think this should be supported because in other schools there are no Breaks, even 
here in this school where we are now, in the past we didn't have Breaks but currently 
we do if you support us, other schools that don't have Breaks will start to have them.
