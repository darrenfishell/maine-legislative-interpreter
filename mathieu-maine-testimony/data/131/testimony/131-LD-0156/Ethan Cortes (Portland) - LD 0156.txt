Testimony of Ethan Cortes, King Middle School
In Support of L.D 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Ethan Cortes. I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
When my brother and sister went to king they did not have an outdoor recess time and
it stressed them out. They had class after class. With me now at king and a time to 
cool down your brain it was easy to continue my day without it. I would have had a 
hard time with my work. It also can help with making friends and see your friends in 
a way that you normally wouldn't. The LD 156 is very important to me because I was 
able to meet with other students, talk with friends and a lot more.
This bill would work for Maine because in king most of the students are learning at a rapid 
rate. The students also get freedom. My opinion about this bill is great for the reasons being 
with the 20 or more minutes they get to be around each other, play sports, talk, and just 
hangout. If recess works at king I have a strong feeling that it can work at other schools.
I would like the committee to support this bill due to the reasons that I have written. Thank 
you for your time and commitment to Maine’s children and I am happy to answer any 
questions you have.
