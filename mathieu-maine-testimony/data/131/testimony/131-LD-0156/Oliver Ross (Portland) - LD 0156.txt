Testimony of Oliver Ross, King Middle School
In Support of LD 156 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Oliver Ross . I am a resident of 
Portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
When I go outside it is a time for me to take a breather and take a moment for me to 
get some energy out. I think if our school (King Middle) has recess then all of the 
other middle schools who don’t have it should.  
Kids like me have adrenaline running through our body. And if kids can get a chance 
to let all of it out they will feel a lot more relaxed for their next class and for the rest 
of the school day. And that is what I feel. So if you can pass this act to require 
outdoor recess it will let the teachers take a moment and kids.
What I want is for kids to be free for a little bit of time during the school day and let 
children release energy. And hopefully this will happen.
Many thanks,
Oliver Ross 
Portland/King Middle School.
