LD 156
INTRODUCTION
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is mohamed. I am a resident of 
portland and a grade 7 student at King Middle School. 
Today, I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 156, “An Act to Require Outdoor 
Recess Time For Students From Grade 6 To Grade 8”. 
SECTION 1
 
It should be come a law becasue some kids stress in classes like math you might stress   
about math when you think hard  in class you stress so when you get a break it makes you 
fell good and relaxed
SECTION 2
 I think it can work at lineman and other schools it works at king  its fine because the kids get 
to relive there stress from school at get to have fun and socialize with there friends
CONCLUSION
I support ld 156 thank you for all youre time
(mohamed)
