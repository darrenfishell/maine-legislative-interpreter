 1 Testimony on LD 329 at public hearing of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services

Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today, and for all of your work on health care. My name is Elizabeth Solet 
and I live in Blue Hill. 
 
I am here to speak in favor of LD 329, “An Act to Ensure Health Care for All Maine Residents.” 
I am involved with Maine AllCare, the nonprofit working toward universal health care for 
Maine, but present my own views here. 
I’ll keep it simple: I want us, as a state and as a nation, to express the care we have for each other 
by ensuring that everyone has health care, without the risk of accumulating debt to get it. And to 
get real value for the billions, or trillions, we spend on health care–for patients, for physicians, 
nurses, and other health care professionals, for businesses small and large, for our communities, 
and for our children and their children. This means a simplified system in which people come 
before profits, everyone is covered, and the investments we make in health care—financial and 
otherwise—go to improving our health and well-being, rather than to line the pockets of a few. 
 
I urge you to support LD 329 as a step in this direction. 
Thank you.
