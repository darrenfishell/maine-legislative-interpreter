LD 1589
To the Hon. Members of Education Committee,
I am writing to express my support for LD 1589, the Bill to adopt rules prohibiting 
teachers in public schools from engaging in political, ideological and religious 
advocacy in the classroom.
We are long past due to get back to basics of reading, writing, math, and science, and 
to stop the social experimentation and brainwashing of our children towards Marxism,
gender confusion, perverse sexual indoctrination,  and the lies that America is a 
terrible country founded  solely on slavery.  Point in fact - if America is so terrible 
why is our border overrun with millions from around the world pouring into it?
Why are we so far behind in academics in this country compared to others ?   For one,
they don't spend time on gender confusion, deviant sexual experimentation instruction
and endless victimhood propaganda.  They are too busy teaching subjects that will 
catapult them to world dominance in economics, math, science and computer skills.  
Let's get back to helping students achieve skills that will help them be competitive in 
the real world.  They're going to need it.   Please vote "Ought to pass" LD 1589.  
Sincerely, E.Gale
