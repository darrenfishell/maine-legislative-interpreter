Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and esteemed members of the Education 
and Cultural Affairs Committee,
My name is Kristen Day, and I'm a mother of three, born and raised in Maine. My 
youngest is a freshman in Windham HS this year. I am writing in support of LD1589.
I have seen through my kids' experience how public school has changed for the worse
in the last 10 years. While teachers have always been largely left-leaning, the 
environment now is openly, proudly, radically progressive, which fuels division, not 
production. 
Some teachers, who are predominantly left-leaning, seem empowered by this leftist 
political climate, and increasingly do not follow policy to check their politics at the 
school door. Students are not being educated how to think by weighing facts, but they 
are being told what to think according to the only one right ideology. Kids are being 
taught to censor, cancel and hate rather than to allow freedom of ideas through 
tolerance. That is a fascist mentality that legislators across the US are enabling to take
root in our kids in school.
Teachers staying unbiased in the classroom has been almost impossible since SEL has
been implemented. Teachers instruct through a lens of background and emotion, 
which leads to division by race and class and overall labeling between peers. This has 
increased bullying tenfold. While China's kids are disciplined, and laser focused on 
math and science 12 hours a day, our students are busy arguing about social labels, 
skin color, or genitals in school.  It's counterproductive to raising a generation that 
will carry Maine, and the United States forward. 
Please vote yes on LD 1589 to ensure that students have the unbiased instruction they 
need to become informed, critical-thinking adults.
