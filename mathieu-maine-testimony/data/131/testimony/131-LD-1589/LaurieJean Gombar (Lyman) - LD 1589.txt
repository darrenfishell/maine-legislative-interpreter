LD 1589
Senator Joseph Rafferty, Representative Michael Brennan and esteemed members of 
the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,I encourage you to vote ought to pass 
on LD1589. Forty years ago- plus or minus if I am dating myself, teachers refused to 
share any political leaning or thought.  I can remember having a few minutes at the 
end of class or the day and some of my peers tried to get our 6th grade teacher to 
divulge if he was voting for one candidate for president or the other.  He would not 
give any inkling one way or the other.  In our classrooms there was no notion of 
supremacy of one skin color over the other.  We were taught that in history 
discrimination was wrong and we should strive to treat others equally based on their 
character.   Time spent in the classroom should be cleared to teach basics of how to 
read and write, how to figure numbers in order to be a competent adult in society, and 
science and history without bias.  Too much precious time in the classroom is wasted 
on ideology and this is quite apparent in the youth today.
