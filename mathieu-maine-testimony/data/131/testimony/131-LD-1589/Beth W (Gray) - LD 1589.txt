Our public school students should not be exposed to their teachers’ ideologies. Many 
of the current ideologies have to do with family values and should be discussed within
the home, not by public school teachers. Let’s get back to educating our children 
through reading the Classics, teaching them how to communicate through writing 
with excellent vocabulary and punctuation, and of course, arithmetic.
