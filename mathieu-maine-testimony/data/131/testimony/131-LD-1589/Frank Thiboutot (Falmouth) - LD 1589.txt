What if I somehow got past the education gatekeepers and secured a teaching position
at Falmouth High School, for example?
If there were even a hint that I supported President Trump's America First agenda, 
disparaged the United Nations and the World Economic Forum's push toward 
globalism and reiterated that the U.S. is a soverign nation based on Judeo-Christian 
values, there would be an outcry heard from Maine to Brussels among the educational
"elite". 
So, why is it perfectly fine for many teachers to advocate for climate change, CRT, 
LGBTQ and transgender rights, open borders or that Islam is a "religion of peace"?
If there were serious, objective discussions based on facts and analysis (which we 
actually had when I went to school) rather than a one-sided "progressive" 
indoctrination taking place that would be another matter. But, we all know that it's no 
secret on which side of the political aisle most teachers lean.
Therefore, it would be best to prohibit teachers from advocating and attempting to 
train another generation of SJWs (Social Justice Warriors) and just stick to the subject
matter at hand for which they are PAID to teach.
I urge you to vote for LD 1589.
Thank you for your consideration.
