Dear Committee Members;
Schools are supposed to be teaching children how to read and write, do math, learn 
Civics, how science works, etc.  They are supposed to be given the skills for cognitive
learning, and how to make rational decisions.  School children are lacking in learning 
skills. Test scores are an abomination, because it seems the teachers have been too 
busy  indoctrinating  the children instead of Teaching them. This is unacceptable.   I 
am not paying my Tax Dollars for indoctrination.  This needs to stop.
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS, thank you.
