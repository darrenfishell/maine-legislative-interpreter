Dear Honorable Members of the Maine Legislature,
I am writing to you today as a teacher at Van Buren District Secondary School, a 
rurally isolated and economically disadvantaged school in Maine. I am the only 
full-time science teacher at our school, and I am writing to testify in support of the 
STEM bill.
I believe that this bill is essential for providing students in rural and economically 
disadvantaged communities with the opportunity to learn about science and 
technology. As a teacher, I have seen firsthand the challenges that students from these
communities face. They often lack access to quality educational resources, and they 
may not have role models who can show them the possibilities of a career in science 
or technology.
The STEM bill would help to address these challenges by providing funding for 
programs that support STEM education in rural and economically disadvantaged 
communities. This funding would be used to provide students with access to quality 
educational resources, to connect them with scientists and engineers, and to support 
STEM-related extracurricular activities.
One way that the STEM bill could help our school would be by providing funding for 
mentors. This would allow us to connect our students with scientists and engineers 
who could provide them with guidance and support as they work on their science fair 
projects. This would be invaluable for our students, as they would benefit from the 
expertise of experienced professionals.
Our school participated in the Maine State Science Fair (MSSF) for the first time this 
year. Our students had support from MSSF staff that was invaluable, but we did not 
have access to great mentors. The students who participated this year want to go back 
and have already discussed how to find good mentors. Funding would help us be 
more successful in the future.
I believe that this bill would have a transformative impact on the lives of students in 
rural and economically disadvantaged communities. It would give them the 
opportunity to learn about science and technology, and it would show them the 
possibilities of a career in these fields. I urge you to support this important bill.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
