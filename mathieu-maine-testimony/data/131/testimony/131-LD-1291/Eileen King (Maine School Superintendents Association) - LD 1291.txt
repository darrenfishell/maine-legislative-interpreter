TESTIMONY NEITHER FO R NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 1291  
 
AN ACT TO ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FOR 
STATEWIDE AND EQUITA BLE ACCESS TO EXPERIENTIAL SCIENCE, 
TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEER ING AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION  
 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and members of the Committee on Innova-
tion, Development, Economic Advancement and Business, I am Eileen King, execu-
tive director of the Maine School Superintendents Association testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committee of the Maine School Superintendents Association neither 
for nor against L.D. 1291.  
 
We appreciate the intent of this bill, but are neither for nor against because it requires 
districts to provide matching funds of $75,000.  
 
Under the proposed matching -fund model, some districts will be able to offer the pro-
gram and others will not.  
 
That creates an inequity among our districts that is not fair to all the children we 
serve as public educators.
