Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Energy,-Utilities and Technology, I am Tony Buxton of Preti 
Flaherty, I represent Industrial Energy Consumer Group (IECG) testifying ini 
strong support of LD 689._ 
Some will say today that Maine should do nothing to increase gas pipeline capacity 
i 
because gas is a fossil fuel. Based on three decades of successful industrial efforts 
to reduce climate gases, such a conclusion is Wrong, and it is deadly wrong. 
No NGO or trade association in New England is more aggressive on climate 
mitigation than is IECG, See IECG’s Climate Initiative website, _ 
getmaineclimateright.org. A- 
The reality of which IECG has become convinced, is that New England’s natural 
gas pipeline shortage materially increases global Warming, causes electricity costs 
to imperil beneﬁcial electriﬁcation and all Maine consumers.G 
20178370.]
Even further, the shortage of .pipeline capacity rips the fabric of our society by 
shuttering large and small employers alike. Most recently, gas pipeline shortages 
caused the closure of the Pixelle paper mill in Jay, Maine, once one of the world’s 
largest mills. This is tragic because it was umiecessary. Maine must keep trying to 
help create more gas pipeline capacity to avoid more tragedies.‘ 
Many blame the skyrocketing cost of Maine electricity on the cost of natural gas. 
That’s only half true. It’s the cost of delivering that gas into New England, not the 
cost of gas itself. The distinction matters. 
In Winter, heating is the priority use of natural gas in New England. This limits the 
gas available. to generate electricity. That remaining limited pipeline capacity 
goes to the highest bidder, and those huge costs drive up the price of natural gas 
ﬁred electricity. Most of the time, those high costs set the rate-for all electricity in 
the wholesale market, whether from gas, nuclear or renewables. Consumers pay 
vastly more. 
The difference between gas pipeline transportation when gas demand is normal 
and when it is high is called the basis differential. ln 2021, the basis differential 
New England electricity consumers paid in the months oflanuary and February 
alone would have paid the entire cost of a new pipeline from Boston to the 
Pennsylvania gas fields.~ 
Here's another startling example: the oil and coal emissions in New England 
during the December 24 grid crisis nearly equaled the emissions savings from all 
Massachusetts solar for a whole year.~ 
The attached charts show how pipeline capacity shortages have vastly 
disproportionate electricity cost impacts and can obliterate our climate mitigation 
policies. 
it doesn't have to be this way. Increased capacity of limited size has huge 
benefits, and they need to operate only until we have built enough renewables to 
201783701
replace most of thegas plants. There already is precedent for this with new gas 
power plants.'
.
, 
Regrettably, the building of new renewables and of needed transmission lines is 
going too slowly..Lool< at NECEC and offshore wind in Massachusetts. This means 
gas plants will be needed longerthan hoped. And that pipeline capacity is 
essentialto avoid burning coal and oil when gas is not available in winter. 
LD 698 is a prudent continuation of the 2013 Maine Legislative effort. 
l-would be pleased to answer questions. Thank you. ,‘

Q other 6% wind 3; solar % hydro petroleum products naturaliqas New England oil-fired power plants likely emitted 373 million pounds of C02» if the first February of 
, 2023‘ 
New England relied heavily on oil-fired power plants to generate electricity during the cold snap at the 
beginning of February 2023 — likely causing over 373 million pounds of CO2 to be emitted in less thana 
week. 
Focusing solely on the petroleum burned, using ISO data on CO2 emissions rates for petroleum-fueled 
generation in December 2022, and making the conservative simplifying assumption that EVs displace 
gasoline use with zero emissions, this amount of carbon is equivalent to hitting “undo” on nearly 37 000 
electric vehicles ’ displacement of fossil fuelemissions. At the end of 2021, New England had 56,780 
registered EVs, so this one week of oil use for electricity undid about 65% of the region’s EV.-related 
carbon savings for the entire year of 2023

Attachment 4 — LD 698 
Excerpt from letter which ISO-N E President and CEO Gordon van Welie wrote to the New 
England Congressional Delegation in response to their concerns about the Christmas Eve 
crisis, dated February 10, 2023 . 
”| strongly agree with you that action is needed beyond maintaining operating reserves, but that action 
is needed in the context of the region's more significant energy adequacy challenges and the transition 
to a clean energy future. The most significant of these challenges is that the region's natural gas 
infrastructure is not sufficiently robust to meet the growing demands from the electric sector, especially 
as winter electricity demand is forecast to increase dramatically in the coming decades due to 
electrification oftransportation and heating. While lSO New England's responsibilities extend only to the 
electric grid, the lack ofsufﬁcient gas supply and transportation infrastructure (over which we do not 
have jurisdiction) will pose continuing risks to the reliability of the bulk power system upon which both 
the retailelectric and gas distribution systems depend. Ultimately, a reliable bulk power system depends 
on adequate and resilient energy inputs. Over time, renewable energy will need to provide increasing 
amounts of that input energy to achieve the states’ goals to decarbonize the electric grid and electrify 
other sectors of the economy."'
