LD 1723
Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and ENR Committee Members,
As a resident and taxpayer of Porter, I am testifying in support of LD 1723 â€œAn Act to
Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and Contracts in a Sale of Assets of a 
Water Export Company Without Review and to Amend the Membership of the Water 
Resources Planning Committee and the Maine Public Drinking Water Commission".  
LD 1723 is an important bill that will add some of the needed protections for the State
of Maine regarding water extraction and exportation for financial gain.  
The citizens of Maine should not be forced to be taken advantage of by giant for 
profit water extraction corporations while enduring blatant (and embarrassing) 
conflicts of interest which assist in filling up their up their own bank accounts.  Maine
is not free from the possibility of a catastrophic water crisis and many citizens have 
already had to endure major financial hardships because of having to drill new wells 
during periods of drought while watching water from their aquifer being trucked past 
their home and out of their watershed.  
It's now 2023 and hard to believe that these harmful practices are still allowed by the 
State.  The passing of this bill is part of the path needed to close our self inflicted 
wounds by taking back our rights.  We have been waiting for the closing the 
loopholes addressed in LD 1723 for many years while "Poland Spring" laughs at 
everyone in the State of Maine all the way to the bank.  This bill will help protect the 
people as opposed to protecting the corporate giants at the expense of the people.
I urge you to support LD 1723 and appreciate your careful consideration on this 
concerning matter. 
Sincerely, 
Corey Lane
Resident and taxpayer of Porter, Maine
