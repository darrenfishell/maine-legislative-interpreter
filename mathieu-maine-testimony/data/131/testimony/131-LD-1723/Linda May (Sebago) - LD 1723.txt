LD 1723
Dear Senator Bennett, Representative Gramlich, and Members of the Environmental 
and Natural Resources Committee,
     I am testifying in strong support of L.D. 1723.  There are few things more 
important than WATER.  We are much more fortunate than most of the world and we 
must protect this valuable resource.  I would like to see the membership of the Water 
Resources Planning Committee changed and have a knowledge and control over the 
transfer of permits and contracts.  These things and other aspects of the bill, like 
sustainability, clean water, and support of agriculture are very important.
     Many thanks to those who produced this bill and may it pass with very strong 
support.            
                                                     Sincerely, Linda May
