LD 1723
I believe it is imperative to support LD 1723.
We must protect our precious resources instead of giving them away to corporations.  
We depend on our elected officials to protect citizens' rights. It is completely 
unethical for all 3 PUC Commissioners and Maine's Public Advocate have Tues to a 
corporation that wants to plunder our water. An incredibly blatant disgusting conflict 
of interest.
