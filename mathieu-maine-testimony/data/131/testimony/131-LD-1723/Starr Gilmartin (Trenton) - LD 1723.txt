In support of LD 1723
What could be more essential to life than water and air?  Without either, we perish.  
Having lived in areas where aquifers ran dry due a combination of overuse, corporate 
(over) extraction, and drought, I am ever more concerned about the impacts that the 
water bottling industry, namely Nestles has on their extraction efforts in Maine.  I 
have not consumed bottled water since I first recognized the threat.    I remember 
living in Western Maine during a drought and wells running dry.  I remember my own
well running dry in Trenton.   I was lucky and could afford to have them drill deeper 
intp the bedrock to find another vein.  Not all were as fortunate.  My brother lives in 
Arizona and the threats of water shortages are very real.  With climate change and 
extremes in temperatures happening on our doorstep, water shortages again may and 
likely will happen again in communities across Maine.  Do we want to suffer the 
same challenges that are experienced out west?  Additionally, we have other threats to
safe drinking water in Maine, namely PFAS contamination and other contaminants 
like perchlorate, nitrates, etc.  Water is an invaluable resource in Maine and as such 
needs to be protected.   We need visionaries who see the threats and act.  The 
recommendations by the Commission to Study the role of Water as a Resource in the 
State of Maine are such visionaries.  
LD 1723, An Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and Contracts in a 
Sale of Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to Amend the 
Membership of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine Public 
Drinking Water Commission is an important step toward protecting water resources 
for sustainability in the state of Maine.  
Thank you for your consideration and time in deliberation of this important 
legislation.
