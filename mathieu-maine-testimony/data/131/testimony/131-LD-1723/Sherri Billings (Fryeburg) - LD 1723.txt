As a resident of Fryeburg and an active community member, a member of our towns 
Conservation Committee, I have been following the water policy for over a decade. 
The reason I am so concerned and have taken the time to share is because water is 
life, just like air is life. We must protect it from privatization. I love that this bill 
supports the recommendations of the 2022 commission to study the role of water as a 
resource in the state of Maine.
This bill would create a more accountability to ensure the state of ME is protecting 
communities and the environment from privatized interests of Maines water for 
export and address the threat to communities as towns plan for and implement climate
resiliency programs and initiatives. 
Imploring you to support LD 1723
