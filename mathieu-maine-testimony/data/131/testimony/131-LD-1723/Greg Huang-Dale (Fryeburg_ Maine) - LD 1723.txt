As a resident of a Maine community where large commercial withdrawals have been 
a source of division and conflict, I fully support this bill that allows for stronger 
citizen and scientific representation on water regulatory committees and commissions,
while limiting the power of commercial interests to influence laws and legislators.  
Maine's water resources are unique and extremely valuable.  However, the value of 
this resource goes well beyond economics and financial gains.  Maine's water 
resources are fundamental to protect for wildlife, outdoor adventurers, educational 
institutions, and community health.  There is no aspect of our society and our 
environment that are not impacted by the way we treat the water that flows below us 
and around us in this state.  
For these reasons and many others, I thank you for supporting this bill that 
strengthens local and citizen efforts to preserve and protect a natural resource that is 
the foundation of all others - water.
