LD 1723
Dear Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
Despite being late in writing you, I still want to express my firm support for LD1723- 
the critical bill before you aimed at protecting our Maine groundwater resources. 
Eventhough we have recently experienced heavy rainfall our preceding years of 
drought in Maine warns us that this resource is very fragile and coveted so demands 
our most serious protection. LD 1723 provides for such protection through a clear 
process by which water is extracted via permits and contracts for bottling purposes. 
The water exports by the bottled water industry needs to be more transparent and be 
more accountable and transparent in the care of the Maine's groundwater sources 
(aquifers) we will continue to depend on. Please, please vote ought to pass on LD 
1723. Thank you
