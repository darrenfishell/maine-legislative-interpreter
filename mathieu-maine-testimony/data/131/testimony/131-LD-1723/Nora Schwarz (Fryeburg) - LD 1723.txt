LD 1723
Greetings Senator Brenner, Representive Gramlich, and ENR Committee Members,
My name is Nora Schwarz, I live in Fryeburg Maine and I am submitting this 
testimony in support of LD 1723. I believe that it is time to approve  "an Act to 
Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and Contracts in a Sale of Assets of Water 
Export Co. Without Review and to Amend the Membership of the Water Resources 
Planning Committee and the Maine Drinking Water Commission".
This Bill supports recommendations made by thee 2022 Commission to Study the 
Role of Water as a Resource in the State of Maine. In approving this Bill you will be 
creating an accountable process to ensure the State is protecting its communities from 
the privatized interests of Maine's water for export.  This Bill will also protect the 
environment of Maine's water from the greed of outside interests which could threaten
our community resiliency planning. 
This Bill will increase the transparency and accountability of large corporations in the
bottled water industry to ensure that they are accountable for the care of the aquifers 
our town's depend on.
This Bill will have a crucial impact on the overdue need to separate the PUC 
Commissioners, Maine's Public Advocate, the Board of Environmental Protection, 
and the Maine Drinking Water Program Commission from the exporter, particularly 
Poland Spring. 
As an increasing number of places in Maine deal with “evaporating” groundwater this
Bill will play a role of protector of abundant groundwater. 
This is a good step on the voyage to proactively protect the water of Maine for its 
environment, people, animals…
With appreciation,
Nora
