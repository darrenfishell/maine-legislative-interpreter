LD 1723
My name is Katherine Rhoda. I live in  Hiram, ME. I’m testifying in support of LD 
1723 “An Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and Contracts in a Sale of
Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to Amend the Membership 
of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine Public Drinking Water 
Commission”.
It’s high time that the State of Maine tighten up oversight and accountability in 
regards to our groundwater. Water is essential to life. It would be a mistake to take it 
for granted. Especially given the challenges of a changing climate, privileging its 
exploitation as a commodity threatens our well-being at a fundamental level. This is 
no time for business as usual, prone as it is to conflicts of interest. The sustainability 
and resiliency of our communities hang in the balance.
LD 1723 moves us in the right direction, building on the work of the 2022 
Commission To Study the Role of Water as a Resource in the State of Maine in 
addressing the big picture.
Please take a prudent step in safeguarding the groundwater of Maine for future 
generations and support LD 1723.
Thank you for your time, your attention, and your public service!
