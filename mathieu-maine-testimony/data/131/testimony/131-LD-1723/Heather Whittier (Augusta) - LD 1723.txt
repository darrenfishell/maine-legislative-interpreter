Augusta
LD 1723
Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and ENR Committee Members, 
My name is Heather Whittier, and I live in Augusta, near the Kennebec.
I am writing in support of LD 1723, An Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of 
Permits and Contracts in a Sale of Assets of a Water Export Company Without 
Review and to Amend the Membership of the Water Resources Planning Committee 
and the Maine Public Drinking Water Commission.
When evaluating basic need, it becomes obvious that nothing is more necessary to our
survival than water. The rapacious extraction of this most essential of Maineâ€™s natural
resources has been going on unchecked for far too long. I very much support these 
important steps towards more responsible stewardship of water resources. Also 
importantly, this bill goes a long way towards restoring public trust in regulatory 
processes. 
Water is Life, as we will continue to learn going forward - this legislation provides 
ways to help those lessons be learned more gently.
Thank you for your time.
