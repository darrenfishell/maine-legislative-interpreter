LD 1723
I’m writing in support of LD 1723. This bill is an important step in making water 
exports by the bottled water industry more transparent. LD 1723 in its entirety would 
create a more accountable process to ensure the State is protecting communities and 
the environment from the privatized interests of Maine’s water for export. For these 
reasons I ask the committee to please vote out to pass. Thank you.
