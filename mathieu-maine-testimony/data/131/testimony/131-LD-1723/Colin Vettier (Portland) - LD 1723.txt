LD 1723
Greetings Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and ENR Committee Members,
My name is Colin Vettier, I live in Portland, ME and I am testifying in support of LD 
1723  “An Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and Contracts in a Sale 
of Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to Amend the 
Membership of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine Public 
Drinking Water Commission”.
Water is life and we should act like it! The financialization of water is the final 
frontier in the commodification of all life on earth. To respect life we must protect 
water at its source and from privatization. 
 LD 1723 in its entirety would create a more accountable process to ensure the State is
protecting communities and the environment from the privatized interests of Maine’s 
water for export and addresses a potential threat in community resiliency planning.
This bill takes an important step in making water exports by the bottled water industry
more transparent and accountable to the care of the groundwater sources (aquifers) we
depend on.
Thank you for reading me. I hope you will make the right choice for our future and 
support LD 1723.
