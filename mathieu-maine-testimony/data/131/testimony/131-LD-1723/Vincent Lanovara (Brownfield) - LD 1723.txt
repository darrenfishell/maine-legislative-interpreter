LD 1723
Greetings and thank you Sen. Bennett, Rep. Gramlich and ENR Committee members 
for your work and proposal of LD 1723, SP0687.
 I, as a longtime resident and voter, feel strongly in agreement for the passage of this 
bill. It would firmly establish, as it should, the confirmation of the State of Maine, as 
the overseer of one of our most precious water resources for its citizens, businesses 
and tourists. Hopefully, it will encourage more involvement by all state and local 
officials to insist on accessibility of records and accountability from all commercial 
extractors that export our water and prevent it from re-charging our aquifers. Thank 
you for this opportunity to express my views.
