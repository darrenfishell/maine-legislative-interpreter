LD 1723
Greetings Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and ENR Committee Members,
My name is Amanda Gavin, I live in  South Portland, ME and I am testifying in 
support of LD 1723  “An Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and 
Contracts in a Sale of Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to 
Amend the Membership of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine 
Public Drinking Water Commission”. I am a PhD student at the University of Maine, 
where I study the impacts of climate change on Maine and Arctic lakes. I worked for 
three years as an environmental consultant in Maine, and prior to that, I received my 
Master's of Science from the UMaine and focused on recovery from acidification in 
Maine lakes. Although it is true that Maine has an abundance of water, the science is 
clear that the quality and seasonal availability of water will change. I have been to 
many conferences with Poland Springs, and there are gaps in their research. It is 
critical to ensure that the State of Maine is taking more steps to make sure the bottled 
water industry is more transparent and accountable to preserving both quantity and 
quality of aquifers in Maine, which LD 1723 will do. Furthermore, the State of Maine
needs to think long and hard about what it means to privatize and commodify water, 
as this will affect (and already is affecting) Maine citizens for generations to come. 
The people of Maine have been clear that they have concerns about water 
privatization and commodification, and the State has repeatedly sided with private 
interests. Passing LD 1723 shows that the State is willing to listen to the people of 
Maine and take steps to ensure our water is clean, plentiful, and accessible right now 
and for generations to come.
