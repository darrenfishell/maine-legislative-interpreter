LD 1723
My name is Audrey Rabinowitz and I live in Denmark, Maine. I am testifying in 
support of LD 1723  “An Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and 
Contracts in a Sale of Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to 
Amend the Membership of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine 
Public Drinking Water Commission”.
Thank you for putting forward this bill. It is such an important step towards protecting
our precious water resources for the benefit of Mainers first and foremost. I am so 
encouraged by:
•Requiring greater accountability from the bottled water industry, and thereby 
prioritizing safe and robust groundwater for Mainers rather than for those who would 
privatize our water for bottling and export.
•A serious review process for permits and contracts relating to water extraction and 
exports.
•The reining in of outside influences and conflicts of interest. 
We must step back and understand that the enticements that the bottled and privatized
water industries have waved in front of us are nothing compared with the long term 
need to protect – and equally importantly, retain control, over our water resources. 
Our future depends on it.
Thank you.
