LD 1723
Hello Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and ENR Committee Members,
My name is Carolyn Schmidtke, I live in Biddeford, ME and I am testifying in 
support of LD 1723  â€œAn Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and 
Contracts in a Sale of Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to 
Amend the Membership of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine 
Public Drinking Water Commission."  Please pass this bill to help promote integrity 
and lessen conflicts of interest in important water related decision making.  Maine 
deserves better than our current standard, and this bill is an key step in the right 
direction.  Thank you for your time.
