LD 1723
Greetings Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and ENR Committee Members,
My name is Lisa Savage, I live in Solon, and I am testifying in support of LD 1723  
“An Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and Contracts in a Sale of 
Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to Amend the Membership 
of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine Public Drinking Water 
Commission”.
The commodification of our potable water reserves in Maine is a terrible mistake that 
future generations will suffer from, and this bill addresses that problem. 
This bill is well-grounded in research and best practices as it supports 
recommendations of the 2022 Commission to Study the Role of Water as a Resource 
in the State of Maine.
This bill creates opportunities for a truly democratic process in which all permits and 
contracts held for the export of water can be examined.
Please vote "ought to pass" on LD 1723.
