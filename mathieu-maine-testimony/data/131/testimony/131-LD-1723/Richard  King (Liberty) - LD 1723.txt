To: Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich , and ENR Committee Members  
 
I am submitting this testimony  in support of LD 1723 , “An Act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of 
Permits and Contracts in a Sale of Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to Amend the 
Membership of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine Public Drinking Water 
Commission”  
 
The bott led water industry has taken advantage of the State of Maine through its more -than -favorable 
water extraction contracts. As a resource, water belongs to the people of Maine and unlike resources 
that are confined to a single property, a water aquifer suppli es large areas and many citizens.  
 
The realization of the value of water and the potential for supply problems have been recognized for 
decades. This bill provides much -needed oversight, accountability, and transparency  of this industry.  
 
I urge you to sen d this bill out of committee with a unanimous “ought to pass” recommendation.
