LD 1723
My name is Sally Chappell.  I live in Bridgton, Maine, and would like to testify in 
support of LD 1723, An act to Prevent the Automatic Transfer of Permits and 
Contracts in a Sale of Assets of a Water Export Company Without Review and to 
Amend the Membership of the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine 
Public Drinking Water Commission.
The privatization of water must be avoided.  All creatures including humans need 
access to water for survival.  It should not be commodified because it can potentially 
be used as a source of power to control others.
Several years ago I participated in an effort to tax Nestle Waters North America.  We 
were unsuccessful unfortunately.  
It looks like LD 1723 will create a more accountable process to ensure the State is 
protecting communities and the environment from the privatized interests of Maine's 
water for export.
Conserving water is a duty I take seriously as a citizen.  Making sure people use water
responsibly is a role to be played by a democratically elected government rather than 
a corporate entity.
