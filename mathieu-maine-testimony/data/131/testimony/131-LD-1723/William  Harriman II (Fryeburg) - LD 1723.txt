William  Harriman II

I'm William Harriman II and as I think about this what I see lacking is the need to 
change the Maine Drinking Water Programs rules and mandates for the installation of 
future gravel packed wells...
  Creating a new commission doesn't change what they are currently mandated to do...
  And as I wrote earlier there's a need to review new contracts when it concerns a 
publicly owned water utility.
  It's the privately run water utilities(such as Fryeburg Water Co.) that cause problems 
because they have just 2 mandates: 1.Increase profits 2.Lower liabilities.In other their 
mandate is to make as much profit as possible for the least amount of service 
provided...and to increase those profits in any way possible...I consider this very 
important to realize and consider before mandating how a publicly owned water 
utility should do its contracts with a bulk exporter...Language is critical in every bill..
