In support of LD 1723 
 
 Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Members of the ENR Committee: 
Despite Maine being considered a “wet” state our watersheds and aquifers are at risk.  Increasing 
demand will only get worse, pollution, extreme weather events are threatening the quality and quality 
of Maine potable water.  A lack of basic but essential data for planning, and an administrative system 
that frequently is chaotic and rife with conflict of interest do not bode well for our future quality of life 
or economic future.  
This bill will: 
1. Prohibit Conflict of interests on the Water Resources Planning Committee and the Maine Public 
Drinking Water Commission.  Such action will go a long way to ensure confidence that Maines 
vital water is being protected for the benefit of its citizens. 
2. Consolidate and coordinate vital data on Maine’s water resources within a single agency. 
3. Direct the Commission to Study the Role of Water as a Resource in the State of Maine study and 
recommend legislation on vital but overlooked issues.   Resiliency, drought preparedness, and 
large scale commercial water extraction that places the health and welfare of the citizens at risk, 
are areas that have been ignored but must be carefully examined in order to prevent a crisis. 
4. Allow for the collection and analysis of data on emerging contaminants of concern such as PFAS, 
and persistent bioacummulative toxic substances.  
LD 1723 will create an accountable and efficient process to ensure that communities and the 
environment are protected from commercialized water extraction, enhance resiliency planning, and 
help ensure water quality. 
Please support LD  1723. 
Thank you for your consideration.
