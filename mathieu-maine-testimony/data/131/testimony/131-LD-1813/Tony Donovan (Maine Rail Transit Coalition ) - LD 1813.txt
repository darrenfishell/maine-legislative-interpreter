LD 1813
I speak in support of ld 1813. To provide one month of no fare ridership on the 
Downeaster in the state of Maine.
I wish it was for all travel to or from Maine.
Too often I hear from people, legislators right in this building, that they would never 
ride the train.  It's too slow is most often the criticism.
Well besides asking Americans to slow down and enjoy the ride, the experience and 
comfort of Downeaster travel needs to be well known. The more people to board the 
better, for the economy and the climate.
Way way more comfortable than a stuffy  bus stuck in traffic, and so nice to sit back, 
close your eyes, use your computer, talk on the phone, have a beer.  And know the 
safety of train travel exceeds all other modes.
I had the pleasure of a 3 day weekend  to Boston last month round trip - yes business 
class,  but no matter.   On time. Fast. Pleasurable staff and cafe service. 
I know the Downeaster management and board can do this without a legislative act.  
But the discussions and debate as we go through the Chambers will be a healthy 
contribution to all the more people about the benefits to rail travel.
Soon, if this Chamber can agree to move off the coast and inland,  all of Maine from 
Lewiston-Auburn,  Bangor, Augusta and through Oxford County to Montreal will 
realize the convenience & importance of expanding passenger train travel in Maine.
Please vote LD 1813 OUGHT TO PASS.
