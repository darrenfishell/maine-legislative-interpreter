Neither for Nor Against  
  
LD 1813, Resolve, to Provide for One Month Free Passenger Rail Service in Maine  
Sponsored by Rep. Collings  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Transport ation   
  
  
Senator Chipman , Representative Williams , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation, I am Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations for the 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services. I am providing testimony Neither for Nor Against LD 18 13. 
 
DAFS â€™ recommends that if the Legislature wants to m ake this bill a funding priority that the 
administrative m echan ism requiring DAFS to reimburse individual passengers  for their fares i s 
unnecessar ily burdensome for both qualifying passengers and us. A  more straig ht-forward 
approach would be for DAFS to reimburse NNE PRA the total fares waived for Maine residents 
during the month of December 2023.  
 
Based upon current ridership and the assumption  that ridership would increase as a result of 
this bill,  the anticipated fiscal impact  ranges from $686,000 to $1,250,000.
