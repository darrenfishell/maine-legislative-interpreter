207-324-5762  Maine Community Action Partnership Opposes LD 784 An Act to 
Establish Welfare Work Requirements for Able -bodied Adults 
Without Dependents  
 
April 7, 2023  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services , I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership , and we oppose LD 784 An Act 
to Establish Welfare Work Requirements for Able- bodied Adults Without 
Dependents . 
 
The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program  (SNAP) already has 
work requirements, although they were relaxed during the pandemic , so 
this bill is entirely moot . The Federal  agency that oversees SNAP also 
allows flexibility when looking at requiring employment, because as we 
know  the right job is not always available where one lives or can easily 
travel to.  Access to adequate food is a necessity for all of us, and for 
familie s with children, even more important.  MaineCare and General 
Assistance may not require its  recipients be working, but having access to 
both makes it much easier and more likely t hat they are able to work.  
 
I realize the state is in a workforce crisis, we need more workers to keep 
our businesses going. The answer to that problem is to create and 
enhance our workforce development programs, our woefully underfunded 
and outdated transportation systems, our childcare availability and 
affordability, and to ease the so -called “welfare cliff,” which is what may 
actually disincentivize going to work. When a family makes just a little bit more money, they lose access to more ; they may lose childcare 
subsidies, income supports and SNAP. The family may earn another 
dollar an hour, but then loses far more and finds itself once again unable 
to buy food.  
 We already know the outcome of this bill –  we have seen it here and in 
other states . Creating barriers to supportive programs does not 
incentivize work.  Individuals and families living in poverty spend hours a 
week meeting with compliance for any and every program they apply for and receive. Programs work at cross purposes; one section of DHHS 
does not talk to another, requiring the same paperwork from cus tomers 
again and again; the causes and conditions of poverty are systemic, not a 
result of personal failings.  
 You, as the Legislature, run the systems . Please make them work better 
for people, not more difficult.  
 
Thank you for your time and attention.
