Testimony of Hilary Schneider, Regional Government Relations Director,  
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  
 
In Opposition to : LD 784 “An Act to Establish Welfare Work Requirements for Able -bodied Adults Without 
Dependents ” 
and  
LD 1194 “An Act to Implement Work Requirements Under the MaineCare Program ” 
April 7 , 2023  
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and members of the Health and Human  Services Committee . My name 
is Hilary Schneider, and I am the Regional Government Relations Director of the North Atlantic  Region for the 
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN).  In this role, I serve as the lead Government 
Relations Director for Maine. ACS CAN, the nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate of the American Cancer 
Society, supports evidence -based policy and legislative solutions designed to eliminate cancer as a major health 
problem. As the nation’s leading advocate for public policies that ar e helping to defeat cancer, ACS CAN ensures 
that cancer patients, survivors, and their families have a voice in public policy matters at all levels of 
government.  
I would like to thank you for this opportunity to submit the following testimony  in opposition to LD 784 and LD 
1194  because ACS CAN strongly opposes any attempt to condition Medicaid coverage on work or community 
engagement . The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  believe s that everyone should have a fair and 
just opportunit y to prevent, detect, treat, and survive cancer. Cancer impacts everyone and critical  to eliminating 
disparities and ensuring health equity is to guarantee that all individuals have access to affordable health 
coverage .  
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expan ded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. A portion of these 
coverage gains are attributable to Medicaid expansion. In Maine, as of February 1, 2023, 106,509 people are 
currently enrolled through MaineCare expansion, including 92,884 adults without children and 13,625 parents 
and caretaker relatives .i According to Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2021, 260,400 Mainers were covered by 
Medicaid, representing 19.5% of the population.ii As a result of coverage expansions, Maine’s uninsured rate is 
the 13th lowest in the nation.iii 
Having adequate and affordable health insurance coverage is a key determinant for surviving cancer. Research 
from the American Cancer Society shows that uninsured people  are less likely to get screened for cancer and 
thus a re more likely to have their cancer diagnosed at an advanced stage when survival is less likely and the cost 
of care more expensive.iv Access to  health care coverage  ensures that serious diseases like cancer can be 
detected and treated earlier but also often means better pa tient outcomes and less costs to the individual and 
the system.  According to the Office of MaineCare Services, as of December 31, 2022, coverage through 
MaineCare expansion alone has resulted in 12,693 breast cancer screenings,  and 10,882 colorectal cancer  
screenings.v

  fight cancer.org | 1.800 .227.2345  Most adults enrolled in Medicaid work : a 2020 population survey showed that 63% of adult Medicaid enrollees 
were working full -or part -time – and another 29% were not working due to caregiving responsibilities, illness or 
disability, or school attendance.vi 
While LD 784 includes language pertaining to “able -bodied adults without dependents” and LD 1194 includes  
exemptions including for a member who “is medically certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment,”  
qualifying for and maintaining an exemption can be confusing and onerous . Exemptions often do not cover all 
situations in which an enrollee is impacted by a serious health condition like cancer.   
Many individuals with a history of cancer rely on Medicaid for their health coverage in Maine and across the 
nation. Many of these individuals are physically unable to hold a job or engage in a job se arch . While these bills 
may intend to exempt them from work requirements , the administrative complexity of constantly reporting 
work or health status could still lead to them being locked out of coverage.  A 2018 analysis suggests that if all 
states were to implement Medicaid work requirements, between 1.4 and 4.0 million Medicaid adults could lose 
coverage, with the majority of disenrollment occurring among individuals who comply with the requirements 
(i.e., are working enough hours to satisfy requir ements) and remain eligible but lose coverage due to new 
administrative reporting burdens or red tape .vii 
Many individuals who fail to meet a work requirement and are locked out of coverage will become uninsured – 
and most of these individuals will likely n eed cancer screenings or preventive services. As stated above, 
individuals without health insurance are  more likely to be  diagnosed with cancer at later stages when the 
disease is more expensive to treat, and survival is less likely.  
Since most adults curr ently enrolled in Medicaid already work or have caregiving responsibilities, school, or 
serious illnesses/disabilities that prevent them from working, work requirements are not likely to increase 
employment and will only create bureaucratic barriers to coverage and care.  
Only one state – Arkansas – has fully implemented a Medicaid work requirement, from June 2018 to March 
2019. Evidence shows that about 25% of those subject to the  requirement lost coverage in 2018. Research 
indicates that enrollees in Arkansas were unaware of or confused by the new work and reporting requirements, 
and they did not provide an additional incentive to work.viii After legal challenges and high administra tive costs, 
the state opted to stop their work requirements. Several courts have ruled that Medicaid work requirements are 
unlawful because they decrease access to Medicaid coverage.  
Research consistently shows that expanding access to Medicaid increases i nsurance coverage rates among 
cancer patients and survivors, increases in early -stage cancer diagnoses, access to timely cancer treatment, and 
receipt of cancer screenings and preventive services.ix For example, a recent study showed that Medicaid 
expansio n was associated with an increase in survival from cancer at 2 years post diagnosis, and the increase 
was most prominent among non -Hispanic Blacks in rural areas, highlighting how expanding Medicaid can reduce 
health disparities.x As such, ACS CAN strongl y supports policies that make it easier for eligible individuals to 
become aware of Medicaid, apply for it, and maintain their coverage.  Instead, LDs 784 and 1194 would work to 
limit Medicaid coverage with work requirements , a policy that could harm people  with cancer and cancer 
survivors.  
For the above reasons, we urge you to vote “ought not to pass”  on LDs 784 and 1194 . We appreciate your time 
and consideration of our comments. I would be happy to answer any questions about this testimony.
