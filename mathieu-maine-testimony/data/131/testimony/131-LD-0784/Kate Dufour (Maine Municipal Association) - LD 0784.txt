In Opposition to  
LD 784, An Act to Establish Welfare Work Requirements for Able -bodied Adults Without 
Dependents  
 
April 7, 2023  
 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee , my name is Kate Dufour  and I am submitting testimony in opposition to LD 784 on 
behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest.   
Considering  that the laws regulating the administration  of the General Assistance  (GA)  
program already contain work search provisions and that GA administrators do not have the 
expertise  necessary to determine who qualifies  as an able-bodied  applicant, municipal officia ls 
elected to oppose the bill.  The state level demands placed on municipal government s are already 
numerous enough that instead of shifting additional tasks to local government partners, t he state 
should  explore  avenues to relieve that pressure .   
If members of the Committee believe a provision of this nature is warranted, municipal 
officials would urge that those discussions occur as part of a larger comprehensive  review of the 
state’s GA and other benef it programs.    
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have questions 
about this testimony, please do not hesitate to contact me at 1 -800-452-8786 or
