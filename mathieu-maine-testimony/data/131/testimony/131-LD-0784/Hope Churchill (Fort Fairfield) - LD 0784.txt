Testimony in Opposition of LD 778 An Act Regarding Work Requirements for 
Able-bodied Adults Without Dependents Under the Supplemental Nutritional 
Assistance Program 
 
Testimony in Opposition of LD 784 An Act to Establish Welfare Work 
Requirements for Able-bodied Adults without Dependents.   
Testimony in Opposition of LD 1194 An Act to Implement Work Requirements 
Under the MaineCare Program.   
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee,  
 
My name is Hope Churchill and I live in Fort Fairfield. I am a self-advocate, meaning I 
am a person who lives with a disability. I am also an member of Speaking Up For Us. 
 
I am in opposition of LD 778, LD 1194 and LD 784 because I have a friend that doesn’t 
have the ability now to work and if they asked him to go to work, he wouldn’t be able to 
get some of his food stamps.  
 
I would work if I had to. But right now, it's not easy, I mean I’d like to work at the library 
but it’s not a paying job and it’s difficult to earn enough money to buy food.  There are 
not a lot of jobs in Fort Fairfield that I can do. If I got a job in Presque Isle I wouldn’t be 
able to go because I wouldn’t have a way to get there and I don’t have a job coach. I 
tried vocational rehab, and they denied me. They told me I am unable to keep a job. I 
didn't know what I wanted to do or how to get a job coach for me, so they denied me. 
Right now, it's hard to get on my feet and I don't have a job coach, If I didn't have food 
stamps, I wouldn’t be able to live, I rely on those. 
 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Hope Churchill
