in
Support

“An

Regarding
Work
Requirements
for
Able-bodied
Adults
Without
Dependents
Under
the
Supplemental
Nutritional

Senator
Tipping,
Representative
Roeder,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
778
and
LD
784.
With
history
and
common
sense
as
a
guide,
Maine
lawmakers
can
craft
a
safety
net
system
that
truly
helps
those
who
cannot
help
themselves,
spurring
individual
independence
while
responsibly
stewarding
the
people’s
hard-earned
tax
dollars.
Too
often,
our
welfare
programs
lock
Mainers
into
a
cycle
of
dependence,
instead
of
empowerment.
Is
this
what
people
really
need
right
now?
A
literature
review
conducted
by
Maine
Policy
Institute
in
2020
found
several
strong
relationships
in
the
data
between
unemployment
and
various
health
problems,
both
physical
and
mental.
1
Middle-aged
individuals
have
poorer
mental
health
when
they
do
not
work.
2
T
hose
who
are
unemployed
are
more
likely
to
experience
elevated
levels
of
depression,
anxiety,
and
mental
deterioration.
3
In
addition
to
increasing
the
risk
of
suicide,
prolonged
unemployment
worsens
depression.
4
The
negative
mental
health
effects
that
arise
from
unemployment
in
young
adulthood
can
last
for
decades,
if
not
a
lifetime.

only
does
unemployment
lead
to
depression,
research
shows
that
employment
lowers
levels
of
depression.

Between
February
2022
and
February
2023,
New
Hampshire
added
more
than
9,000
workers
to
its
civilian
workforce
while
Maine
lost
more
than
6,000.

Restoring
proper
work
requirements
for
welfare
recipients
is
critical
to
rebuilding
our
state’s
workforce,
as
these
requirements
have
done
before.
Lawmakers
can
ensure
that
Mainers
are
contributing
to
society
and
working
to
pull
themselves
out
of
poverty
with
these
simple
reforms.
One
national
study
conducted
by
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(DHHS)
examined
20
“work
for
welfare”
programs
and
found
that
all
groups
who
participated
had
increased
earnings
three
years
after
joining
the
program.
8
In
our
own
state,
we
have
seen
that
those
who
exit
welfare
programs
and
find
a
job
experience
increases
in
income.
When
former
Governor
Paul
LePage
required
Mainers
receiving
certain
forms
of
benefits
to
meet
work
requirements,
participants
in
the
program
saw
a
114
percent
increase
in
wages
after
one
year.

Please
deem
LD
778
and
LD
784
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
look
to
economic
opportunity,
rather
than
government,
to
pull
people
out
of
poverty.
Only
one
of
these
methods
has
actually
worked
in
the
long
run.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
