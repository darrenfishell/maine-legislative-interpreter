3-7-2023To: Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Re: LD 706, An Act to Improve Access to Specialty Health Care Providers by Reducing CopaymentsDear Members of the Committee,Thank you Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the HCIFS committee.  My name is Dr. Zev Myerowitz.  I am a resident of Cape Elizabeth and a lifelong resident of the State of Maine.  I am a third generation Chiropractor and second generation acupuncturist in my thirteenth year of practice.  I am the current president of the Maine Chiropractic Association, and will be testifying in support of  LD 706.Thirteen years ago my wife and I started Cape Integrative Health (CIH).  CIH currently employs 12 clinical providers between our primary care, chiropractic, acupuncture and physical therapy services.  Of those providers, 10 fall under the “specialist” copay for most health insurance plans. We see over 30,000 ofﬁce visits annually, we understand insurance.Our ofﬁce currently chooses to work within the insurance market, but we are beginning to reevaluate that decision. Our ofﬁce, like most specialty ofﬁces, incurs signiﬁcant administrative overhead costs to work with insurances. We employ full time coders and auditors to make sure that our services rendered reﬂect the entirety of what is submitted to the patient’s insurance.  We take on further costs employing separate billing specialists to verify the status of payments from third party payers.  Due to the costs of employing these skilled positions with recent inﬂation, I estimate the administrative cost of working within the insurance system adds a 30-40% markup to a cash based patient for the same services. Our specialty copays are now beginning to exceed the entirety of the cost of the visit.

This creates an illusion of healthcare “coverage” where in reality the patient is footing the entire bill.  As I mentioned, CIH is encountering ever increasing costs to administer the insurance claim only for the balance due to be entirely on the patient.  A colleague of mine who mentors new physical therapists has conﬁrmed that over 90% of new graduates who go into private practice refuse to participate with insurance. With the current trends it won’t be long until $100, $150 or even $200 “copays" become commonplace.  We are all aware of multiple large provider specialties leaving the network of a major local insurer due to lack of timely reimbursement. When the copayment exceeds the cost of the service, there will no longer be a reason for providers to participate in insurance in any capacity.  It would make no sense for providers to incur the administrative costs of billing and processing insurance only to then have to directly bill the patient anyway.  Patients will soon ﬁnd that all of their preferred providers have left the insurance markets en masse.  The beginning of this shift is already happening with the recent increase in cash based !direct primary care” models throughout southern Maine.Sincerely,Zev Myerowitz Jr. D.C., Dipl. Ac.
