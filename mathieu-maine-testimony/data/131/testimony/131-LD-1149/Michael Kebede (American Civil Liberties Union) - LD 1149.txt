TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ. 
LD 1149 — Ought To Pass 
RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to 
Strengthen the Due Process Rights of Persons Accused by Requiring 
Notification of Those Rights 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
April 3, 2023A 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, greetings. My name is Michael Kebede, and I am 
Policy Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our members, I urge you to support 
this Resolution because it would strengthen the rights of people in state custody. 
The United States Supreme Court sometimes gets things wrong. Dred Scott v. 
Sanford in 1857. Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. Korematsu v. United States in 1944. 
When the Supreme Court issues decisions like these, it behooves states to' 
strengthen their own constitutional protections. The bill before you today would 
give Maine voters a chance to codify a basic right from which our federal 
jurisprudence seems to be retreating. 
Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement cannot be held liable 
under federal civil rights law for violating our Miranda rights.1 See Vega v. Tekoh, 
142 S.Ct. 2095, 2099 (U.S., 2022) (ruling that a Miranda violation does not 
constitute the deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution that is enforceable 
under § 1983). There is _no knowing what the Court will do next. That is precisely 
why this bipartisan resolution is necessary and timely. 
Maine has had a longstanding tradition of providing stronger constitutional 
protections than the federal government. See, e.g., State v. Sklar, 317 A.2d 160, 171 
(Me. 1974) (construing right-to-jury-trial guarantee in section 6 of the Maine 
1 In Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966), the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Ernesto 
Miranda because the police obtained his confession without informing him of his Fifth Amendment 
right to remain silent and Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
Constitution to apply to all criminal prosecutions, even though federal jury-trial 
right extended only to serious or non-petty crimes); State v. Fleming, 2020 ME 120, 
n. 9, 239 A.3d 648 (“To the extent that the federal counterparts to Maine's 
requirement of an impartial jury, found in art. I, § 6 of the Maine Constitution, are 
deemed not to impose the inquiry we mandate today, we conclude that the Maine 
Constitution demands more .”). 
The Law Court has never ruled that the state constitution requires law enforcement 
to Mirandize a person in custody. See State v. Bleyl, 435 A.2d 1349, 1357-58 (Me., 
1981) (“this Court has never decided that the Maine Constitution requires Miranda 
warnings to be administered to a person undergoing custodial interrogation ”); State 
v. Athayde, 277 A.3d 387, 398 n.7 (Me., 2022) (“In applying article I, section 6 of the 
Maine Constitution, we have not, to date, made the delivery of Miranda warnings a 
requisite for a statement made in a custodial interrogation to be admissible ”) But 
those warnings, or similar warnings, should be mandatory, since their benefits far 
outweigh their costs. 
This resolution, if enacted and passed by voters, would help ensure that police 
inform anyone in a custodial interrogation of their basic rights under the state 
constitution. These are the rights: 
- To counsel; _ 
- To know and receive a copy of the charges against them; 
- To confront their accusers; 
- To call favorable witnesses; 
- To a speedy, public and impartial trial; 
- To a jury; 
~ To remain silent (or against self-incrimination); 
- To life, liberty, property or privileges, but by judgement of that person's peers 
or the law of the land. 
It would take less than a minute to recite these rights. Constitutionalizing a 
recitation of these rights to people in custodial interrogations would ensure that our 
rights are better protected in a format that a unanimous Supreme Court has called 
“inherently coercive. ” JD.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. 261, 269 (2011). 
We urge you to vote ought to pass.
