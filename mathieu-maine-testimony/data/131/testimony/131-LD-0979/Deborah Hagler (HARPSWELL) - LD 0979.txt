Testimony of the Maine Chapter of Pediatrics in favor of LD 979- Resolve, to Fund 
Treatment Services and Certain Transportation Costs for Individuals with Substance 
Use Disorder 
 
Good morning, Senator Baldacci and Representative Meyer and members of the 
Committee on Health and Human Services Deborah Hagler MD, MPH, FAAP, 
resident of Harpswell, immediate past president of the Maine Chapter of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics testifying in favor of LD979 Resolve, to Fund 
Treatment Services and Certain Transportation Costs for Individuals with Substance 
Use Disorder. 
 
The Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports efforts 
to create more treatment options for youth with substance use disorders in Maine. 
Only 6-8 % of youth with a substance use disorder receive any type of treatment. 
There are several challenges to youth receiving care and a significant barrier is 
transportation and many levels of care are not available to youth around the state- 
including the options for inpatient stays or longer-term residential care. 
 
 The Maine Chapter of The American Academy of Pediatrics  along with Day One, 
the Office of Child and Family Services, The Maine Pediatric and Behavioral Health 
Partnership, and the Opioid Response Network are currently engaged in yearlong 
learning collaborative- TREAT ME Treatment/Recovery/Education/Advocacy/for 
Teens with substance use disorders in Maine to educate  those with primary access to 
adolescents and young adults on the different ways to identify and intervene for 
youth with substance misuse and substance use disorder. The clinicians participating 
in this collaborative are deeply committed to enhancing care for youth with  
substance use disorders and understand they will be part of a layered system of care  
that will provide treatment options in communities around the state but some youth 
will need more intensive support and these beds will be a critical part of creating the 
infrastructure needed to treat Maine’s youth. 
 
  We have seen an increase in overdose deaths in our adolescent population and we 
know that most adults with substance use disorders-initiated substance use in 
adolescence,  building  our treatment options for youth is critical. We strongly urge 
you to support this bill.
