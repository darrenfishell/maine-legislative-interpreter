Testimony of Jeffrey S Burroughs, Head of School, Lincoln Academy,
In Support of LD 703, An Act to Clarify the Requirements Regarding Fingerprinting Law 
Enforcement Officers in School
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs
March 21, 2023
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, my name is Jeff Burroughs and I represent Lincoln Academy and I testify in support of LD 
703.
As a Head of School firmly connected and committed to serving its community, I am in support of any 
legislation that makes it easier for professionals to take on parttime roles like coaching, substitute 
teaching and other ancillary roles that support students and families.  Across the state of Maine and 
around the region there is shortage of qualified people to work in schools in many capacities.  Coaching 
and substitute teaching are just a couple areas of school staffing that schools have a difficult time filling.  
Having been fortunate to have an excellent relationship with law enforcement agencies, both Lincoln 
County Sheriffâ€™s Office and the Damariscotta Police Department we are always interested when a law 
enforcement officer expresses interest in getting involved with our school in addition to their professional 
capacity.
I think that any changes that can be made to make it easier, while assuring the DOE and school officials 
that Law Enforcement Officers have been properly screened, should be considered.  While this bill may 
not be a finished product in terms of that assurance that could be provided from the Law Enforcement 
Agencies to the DOE. I do feel that the aims of the bill are worth pursuing and that we should honor the 
willingness of these important public servants and make it a bit easier for them to join our communities.
We are a better school and more responsive to our community by engendering closer relationships with 
Law Enforcement and I believe this bill could help to foster the same for other educational communities.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey S Burroughs
Head of School 
Lincoln Academy
