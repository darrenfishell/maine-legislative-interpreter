Senator

members

the
Joint
Standing

Labor
and

I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portlandâ€™ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
support
of
LD
1935,
An
Act
to
Promote
W orkforce
Development
by
Establishing
a
W orkforce
Development
Program.
If
established,
this
program
could
be
of
significant
assistance
in
addressing
many
of
the
challenges
facing
Portland
residents
and
businesses,
including
housing
af fordability
and
access,
labor
shortages,
and
a
lack
of
coordination
of
the
various
resources
typically
needed
by
unhoused
and/or
underemployed
individuals.
W e
believe
this
bill
has
the
potential
to
positively
impact
municipalities
across
the
state
who
struggle
with
many
of
the
same
issues
as
Portland,
and
are
eager
for
the
State
of
Maine
to
coordinate
and
lead
the
development
of
meaningful
solutions.
LD
1935
has
the
potential
to
be
an
important
step
toward
such
a
solution.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
