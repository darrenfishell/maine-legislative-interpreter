Re: L.D. 1105, An Act to Ensure Lower Costs and Consumer Protections for Patients by 
Prohibiting Certain Billing Practices 
 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 1105.  The purpose of this letter is to provide 
you with background information. This bill would amend the Maine Health Security Act1 to 
prohibit health care providers from denying health care services or treatments based on how a 
patient intends to pay. The bill also would require health care providers to disclose the cash 
charge for their services and allow a patient to pay cash instead of filing an insurance claim when 
the cash price is less than the patient’s cost-sharing amount.    
 
This bill also would amend the Health Plan Improvement Act2 to prohibit health insurance 
carriers from prohibiting a provider from giving an enrollee the option of paying the provider's 
cash charge and disclosing to an enrollee if the cash charge is less than the enrollee's cost-sharing 
amount for a claim going through their insurance.   
 
Under this bill, if the charge for a service is within an insured patient’s deductible, and the 
provider charges insured patients a higher fee than uninsured patients, the patient must be given 
the option to waive insurance coverage and pay the lower uninsured fee. Under this option, the 
patient would not get credit toward meeting their deductible. The Bureau recommends that 
providers be required to notify patients of this consequence in writing when they waive their 
insurance coverage.

This bill imposes obligations on providers, who do not normally fall under the jurisdiction of the 
Bureau. We recommend assigning enforcement authority to an agency with a closer regulatory 
connection to health care providers. 
 
I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance. 
Sincerely,
