LD 1105
Dear Health Coverage Insurances and Financial Services Committee,
My name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China Village. I am writing today to ask 
you to support LD 1105.
This affects me and my lifespan because it's a huge barrier to healthcare. I am 
incredibly frustrated that Canadian citizens live longer just because their healthcare 
systems are more accessible to the people they are intended to serve. But alas, I live in
Maine- where I will probably die early due to inaccessible costs or billing practices. 
So, I support anything that makes healthcare more accessible that also improves my 
longevity and quality of life. 
So support LD 1105 or be comfortable with people dying earlier than their supposed 
to - because the blame will ultimately fall to you.
