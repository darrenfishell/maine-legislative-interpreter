LD 454
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 454.
This bill will ensure that assistance goes to Maine people and that others will be less 
likely to come to Maine, incentivized by these benefits.  
Please deem LD 454 in “Ought To Pass” to ensure that these benefits which are costly
to taxpayers, are provided only to Maine residents, and are not incentivizing welfare 
migration into Maine.
