Testimony in Support of LD 1287 
An Act To Establish an Appeal Process for Child Care Providers 
Presented to the Ioint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
April 10, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services, my name is Troy Jackson. l serve as President of the Maine Senate 
and have the great honor of representing Aroostook County in the Legislature. I am here today 
to introduce LD 1287, "An Act to Establish an Appeal Process for Child Care Providers." 
Maine is in the middle of a childcare crisis. lt doesn't matter whether you live in Portland or 
Presque Isle, parents can't find a quality, affordable childcare provider with open slots in their 
communities. At the same time, childcare providers can barely afford to do this important 
work. Solving this crisis requires state lawmakers to work with parents and providers to expand 
programs and better support providers. 
The legislation before you seeks to improve one piece of the childcare puzzle. It would establish 
a fair and transparent appeal process for providers in response toa licensing decision made by 
the Department of Health and Human Services that limits their ability to provide care. 
The idea for this proposal came from conversations with providers throughout Aroostook 
County. Creating an appeal process will both ensure that providers feel they are being treated 
fairly and will provide the opportunity for more providers to enter the childcare market or 
expand their offerings. It will also allow for more transparency so that providers understand 
why a license was suspended or denied, and what steps can be taken to improve their 
application or resolve the issues pertaining to their license. This bill also leaves the details of the 
appeals process to the department to allow them to create a system that works within the 
department and builds on department employees ’ expertise. 
If you take a look at the numbers, the situation is pretty bleak when it comes to childcare in 
Maine. As of 2022, there were 1,516 licensed-child care facilities operating within the state 
Stare House (207) 287-I500 * Cell (207) 436-0763 * Fax (207) 287-5862 * Toll Free 1-800-423-6900 * TTY 711

compared to 1,662 only five years earlier.1 What's worse is that many of the licensed-facilities 
that remain open are not operating at full capacity due to the lack of childcare workers across 
the state? Establishing an appeals process that promotes fair and transparent licensing 
decisions will help more providers feel that they have a voice and hopefully remain open and 
provide top-notch early care and education to our kids. 
Thank you for your time today. I hope you will join me in supporting this proposal. Thank you 
for your consideration. I'd be happy to answer any questions the committee might have.
