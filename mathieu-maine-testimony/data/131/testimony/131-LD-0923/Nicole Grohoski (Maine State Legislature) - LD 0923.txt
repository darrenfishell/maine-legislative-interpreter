THE MAINE SENATE 
131st Legislature 
Testimony of Senator Nicole Grohoski 
In Support of LD 923, “An Act to Improve Disclosure of Present and 
Future Costs to Maine Electricity Consumers ” 
Before the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
21 March 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and fellow members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology. As you know, my name is Nicole 
Grohoski and I am honored to represent the coastal and island communities of Senate District 7. 
I am here to present LD 923, “An Act to Improve Disclosure of Present and Future Costs to 
Maine Electricity Consumers. ” 
Maine people deserve to have accurate and comparable information about the electricity rates 
they pay. If I have a question about my bill, I check the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) 
website to see if it accurately reﬂects my rates. For this reason, Section l, paragraph 2 of this bill 
requires the PUC to publish current residential T&D rates on its website. Additionally, I would 
like to amend this bill to include current standard offer supply rates as well. 
At present, the T&D rates posted on the PUC site for our investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are 
from December 31st, 2022. Depending on when rate increases are authorized to occur, this 
information may be accurate or it may not be. For our T&D consumer-owned utilities (COUs), 
the information is also out of date, since it is gathered from annual reports (at this time, the 2021 
annual reports). Since there are only two IOUs and nine COUs in Maine, it should be a simple 
matter to request the information and publish it. 
Regarding supply rates, the IOU standard offer service rates take effect January lst and therefore 
are not reﬂected in the PUC’s chart. These rates can change in a single day by as much as 80%, 
as they did from December 31 to January 1 of last year, or by 49%, as they did this year. With 
minimal effort, we could provide 800,000 IOU customers accurate information. 
Providing obsolete infonnation is misleading. Paragraph 2 of this bill seeks to provide clear 
information to our constituents, and with a few minor tweaks, I believe it can do so effectively. 
An additional amendment I propose in this paragraph is to require that the PUC update 
their website with any rate changes that they approve to occur mid-year.

Maine people also deserve to know how regulatory decisions made today will impact their future 
r_.2i_t<% _s. For this reason, Section 1, part 1 of the bill requires that the commission also publish an 
estimate of all deferred costs for which ratepayers of a public utility may be responsible. Section 
2 also requires the commission, when issuing an order approving a rate change, to include an 
estimate of the total deferred costs, the estimated or actual term of the deferral and the total 
estimated interest and return on equity included in the utility's approved rates. 
Cost deferral is an important tool in the regulatory toolbox. At times, utilities experience extreme 
or sudden costs. This may be due to the loss of a large customer or the expenses of an extreme 
weather response, for example. Deferral, typically meaning the creation of “regulatory assets,” 
helps to “smooth” rates and avoid sudden increases. Such assets are also attractive to utility 
investors, because they let shareholders recover costs, plus proﬁts, over a longer period of time. 
This ﬂexibility is important. Regulators often have very legitimate reasons to allow the creation 
of regulatory assets. On the other hand, there is also a real danger that too much cost deferral 
may amount to kicking a very big can down the road. 
Deferrals can work well for regulators and those who appointed them in the short run, and work 
well for utility investors who are able to anticipate healthy future earnings on the equity portion 
of the deferred cost. However, due to the nature of compounded interest, these deferrals can also 
mean that in the end, ratepayers pay far more than they should have. For this reason, it is 
important that such decisions be fully visible, at all times, to the public and to those they trust to 
represent them. 
Some minor amendments to this section may be necessary to accomplish its purpose and I look 
forward to considering feedback from stakeholders, including the PUC. 
Thank you for your attention and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

Understanding Regulatory Assets 
Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 62 governs the 
recording of regulatory assets. According to the statement, regulatory assets are created 
when certain expenses are recognized as deferrals instead of period expenses. 
These expenses may include environmental and decommissioning costs, deferred power 
costs, losses on asset retirements, extraordinary repair and maintenance costs, unrealized 
derivative losses, advance refunding costs, storm damage costs, and debt issuance costs.

The regulator has discretion over which expenses (and their amounts) can be included in 
rates for recovery for a public utility. If it deems an expense item as not eligible to 
recover from ratepayers, it will require the utility to expense it instead of recording it asa 
regulatory asset. Amounts allowed as regulatory assets must be amortized over an 
expected period through rates. GASB rules entail detailed tracking of expenses and their 
associated estimated recovery periods. Each regulatory asset must also be disclosed in 
detail in a utility's ﬁnancial statements. 
Example of a Regulatory Asset: 
Electric utility Edison International is the parent company of Southern California Edison 
(SCE). SCE carried $1,314 million in short-term regulatory assets and $7,120 million in 
long-term regulatory assets on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The breakdown 
of the regulatory assets is disclosed and discussed in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements, 
under the term "SCE Regulatory Assets." 
From CMP Annual Report, 2021: note that “regulatory assets” represents nearly half the value of 
the distribution rate base, and nearly a ﬁfth the value of the total T&D rate base. 
Regulatory Assets (182.3) at year end (pp. 3&4): $443,688,849 
Distribution Rate Base (p. 19): $1,0l2,976,000 
Transmission Rate Base (p.20): $l,497,688,036
