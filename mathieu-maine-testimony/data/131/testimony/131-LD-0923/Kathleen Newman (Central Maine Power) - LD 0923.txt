Kathleen Newman, Director of Government Affairs 
LD 923 An Act to improve Disclosure of Present and Future Costs to i\/laine Electricity Consumers 
March 21, 2023 
Testifying: Neither for Nor Against 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology ("EUT"), my name is Kathleen Newman, presenting testimony neither 
for nor against LD 923, An Act to improve Disclosure of Present and Future Costs to Maine 
Electricity Consumers.S 
This bill which appears to aimed at providing additional transparency around a component of 
electric costs — deferral amounts - by requiring the PUC to print an estimate of all deferred costs 
for which ratepayers of a public utility may be responsible on their website. Such information is 
already available publicly on the PUC's website - contained in rate proceeding materials, Annual 
Compliance Filing materials and final Orders. it also requires the PUC, when issuing an order 
approving a rate change, to include an estimate of the total deferred costs, the estimated or 
actual term of the deferral and the total estimated interest and return on equity included in the 
utility's approved rates. Again, this information is already contained within the pleadings and 
other regulatory materials relating to the Order. The legislation would require this already public 
information to be culled and set out clearly along with issuance of the Order. 
Ci\/lP strongly supports transparency for electric customers. For some deferrals, we defer the 
variance from actuals to projection. This is done to minimize the deferral. For others, we record 
them as they occur until we receive regulatory approval to recover the costs or return them to 
customers. Deferrals are detailed in our FERC Form 1 filing. As of the end of 2021, we had 55 
different Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on our books (see attached). 
Pragmatically speaking, the deferred cost estimate requirement may be difficult to provide 
because the dollar amount reported is largely dependent on the nature of the deferral. We 
provide our best estimate for projections and do not assume variances so it is likely that the total 
deferral expense may deviate from that which gets published. To address this, the Commission 
could simply indicate the components of the deferral expense rather than providing a set 
number that will be subject to change. 
Thank you for your consideration.
