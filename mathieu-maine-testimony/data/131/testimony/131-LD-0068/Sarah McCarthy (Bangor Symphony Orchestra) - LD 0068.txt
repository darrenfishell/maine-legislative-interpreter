LD 68
On behalf of the Bangor Symphony Orchestra (BSO), a 501(c)3, I would like to offer 
our support of bill LD 68 - An Act to Exempt Certain Nonprofit Organizations from 
the Sales and Use Tax and the Service Provider Tax. If provided sales tax exemption, 
the BSO would potentially save as much as $5,000 to $10,000 annually, making it the
equivalent of our largest sponsorships for a season.
I appreciate your support of this bill.
