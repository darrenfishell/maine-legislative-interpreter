Testimony of Meg Helming before 
the Committee On Taxation 
in support of
LD 68: An Act to Exempt Certain Nonprofit Organizations from the Sales and Use Tax 
and the Service Provider Tax
February 14, 2023
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and distinguished members of the Committee On 
Taxation, my name is Meg Helming and I’m the COO for the YMCA Alliance of Northern New 
England, which represents the 15 YMCAs in Maine. The YMCA strongly supports LD 68: An Act to 
Exempt Certain Nonprofit Organizations from the Sales and Use Tax and the Service Provider 
Tax. 
As one of the largest nonprofit community-serving organizations in the country, and in Maine, 
the YMCA supports policies that strengthen the nonprofit sector by streamlining administrative 
processes so organizations can spend more of their resources meeting their missions. A strong 
and vibrant nonprofit sector is essential for building strong communities.
We urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 68.
Respectfully submitted,
YMCA Alliance of Northern New England
