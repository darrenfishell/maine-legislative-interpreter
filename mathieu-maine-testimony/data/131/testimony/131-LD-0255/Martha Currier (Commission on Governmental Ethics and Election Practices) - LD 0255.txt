LD 255 — An Act to Require Campaign Finance Reports for State and County Candidates 
Other than Governor to be Filed on the 42”“ Day Before Any Election 
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
February 6, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the committee - my name is Martha 
Currier, and I am the Assistant Director of the Maine Ethics Commission. The Commission is 
neither for nor against LD 255. 
The Legislature has made clear that timely disclosure of campaign activity is critically important 
to Maine’s elections. This bill would create one additional report for all Maine Clean Election 
Act (MCEA) and traditionally financed legislative, and county candidates 42 days beforea 
primary or special election. Below are two reporting tables — one for MCEA candidates and one 
for all other candidates (excluding the governor). This testimony is intended to explain how the 
additional report would affect roughly 450 candidates and our administration of their financial 
reporting by demonstrating how LD 255 would have impacted the 2022 election cycle. 
Traditionally Financed Legislative and County Candidates. LD 255 shortens the length of time 
between the current January Semiarmual and the 11-Day Pre-Primary Reports for these 
candidates by adding a report to the statute in May. Currently, traditionally ﬁnanced candidates 
ﬁle their initial report in January of an election year if they’ve had ﬁnancial activity over $500, 
or 11 days before the primary, which covers the ﬁrst ﬁve months of their campaign. 
Commission staff note that most candidates may ﬁle little or no ﬁnancial activity on the 
proposed 42-day pre-primary report because most campaigns, in our experience, do not have 
much activity until immediately before the primary. Also, some of these candidates do not have 
an opponent in the primary election.

MCEA Candidates. Candidates intending to qualify for MCEA funds ﬁle a Seed Money Report 
outlining their initial contributions and expenditures since their registration. Seed money isa 
provision in the law that allows candidates to collect a small number of private contributions to 
start their campaigns. Typically, the report is ﬁled around April 20 or within the next week if the 
candidate requests additional time to spend down their seed money. 
As shown in the chart below, the introduction of a campaign ﬁnance report 42 days beforea 
primary election for MCEA candidates would result in an additional report that has a very short 
time period (in many cases, less than ten days). If the committee is generally in favor of 
requiring a 42-day pre-primary report, please consider exempting MCEA candidates or adjusting 
their reporting schedule in other ways.
