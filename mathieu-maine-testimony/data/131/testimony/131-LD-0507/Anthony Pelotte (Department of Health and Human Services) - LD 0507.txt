Re: LD 507 —An Act to Improve Outcomes for Youth Transitioning ﬁom State Care by 
Reducing Barriers to Maintaining Health Coverage 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services: 
This letter is to provide you with information that might be helpful to you in your deliberations 
regarding LD 507. This Act requires the Department of Health and Human Services to enroll 
children who are in foster care in the MaineCare program and to maintain their enrollment until 
they reach 26 years of age without requirements to complete annual eligibility redeterminations. 
Coverage for former foster youth is a mandatory Medicaid coverage group established under the 
Social Security Act‘ . As required, Maine provides former foster youth MaineCare coverage if 
they are under the age of 26, not enrolled in other Medicaid coverage, and were on Medicaid and 
in foster care when they turned age 18. 
Annual redeterminations are Federally required for all Medicaid beneﬁciaries2 , including former 
foster youth. Unfortunately, as the former foster youth program is a federally required Medicaid 
program and states are unable to waive the redetermination requirements, this bill cannot be 
implemented as proposed. 
States are able to renew eligibility for beneﬁciaries through an ex parte process? ’ An ex parte 
renewal is a redetennination of eligibility that states can make based on reliable information 
available in the beneﬁciary’s case record, including information accessed through electronic data 
sources, without requiring additional information or veriﬁcation from the individual. This can 
ease the burden of the mandatory renewal process for most MaineCare beneﬁciaries, including 
former foster youth. Maine is currently work to implement the ex parte process and is projected

We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.
