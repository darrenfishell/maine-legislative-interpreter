Judicial Branch testimony in favor of LD 339, An Act to Provide Electronic 
Access to Confidential Juror Information:
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony in support of this Judicial Branch bill.
A bill very similar to LD 339 was proposed during the 130th Legislature, as many of you 
will recall. Former LD 233 received a positive report in committee, passed the full Legislature, 
but died on the special appropriations table. There was broad support for this bill.
Since then, the Judicial Branch has purchased the software necessary to implement 
electronic access to the juror information outlined in the pending bill, LD 339. In order to begin 
to permit electronic access to juror questionnaires, it is necessary to amend the statute, which 
currently only permits review of juror information “at the courthouse.” The Judicial Branch thus 
seeks a small change in the statute, Title 14 section 1254-A, that will allow for electronic access 
to the information.
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer your questions.
