Testimony of Representative Erin Sheehan introducing  LD 339 - An Act to Provide Electronic Access to Confidential Juror Information before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary  March 8, 2023  Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Esteemed Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Erin Sheehan and I represent part of Biddeford. Today I am pleased to introduce to you a Judicial Department bill, LD 339 - An Act to Provide Electronic Access to Confidential Juror Information.  Current law permits counsel and pro se litigants to review juror questionnaires “at the courthouse” only. The Judicial Branch has purchased the technology required to implement electronic access in order to facilitate the jury selection process. LD 339 proposes the statutory change that would be required to begin providing electronic access. I thank you for your time and your consideration. I would urge you to reserve your questions for those who will follow me — though I’m happy to give any questions a try. And I would ask permission to rejoin the committee around the horseshoe for the duration of the hearing.HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 2 STATE HOUSE STATION AUGUSTA, MAINE  04333-0002 (207) 287-1400 TTY: MAINE RELAY 711  Erin Sheehan (she/her) P.O.
