                             In Support of  
LD 450 An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Upgrade and Replace 
                  Emergency Alert System Infrastructure of Maine Public 
Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
April 25, 2023 
  
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and members of the Committee on Appropriations and 
Financial Affairs, 
 
My name is Grace Leavitt. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am serving as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51. I have over 43 years of 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certified teacher. The MEA represents 
nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools, in our institutions 
of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine Community College System, 
many of the employees of Maine Public Broadcasting, as well as students in teacher prep programs and 
many retired educators. 
 
MEA supports LD 450 An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Upgrade and Replace 
Emergency Alert System Infrastructure of Maine Public. 
 
Maine Public Broadcasting provides the statewide system to alert all other stations around the state in 
the event of any number of kinds of emergencies that threaten the safety of the people of Maine. This 
system is an essential component of public safety in our state, yet the infrastructure is aging. This needs 
to be addressed. MPBN relies heavily on membership and donor support for its funding (more than half 
of the operating budget). The bonds that would be issued through the passing of LD 450 will provide 
much needed dollars to ensure the infrastructure of the alert system can be upgraded so that it continues 
to provide this vital service for the people of Maine. 
 
 
We urge your support of LD 450.
