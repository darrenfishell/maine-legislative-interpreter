Testimony of Senator Donna Bailey introducing
LD 751, An Act to Clarify the Powers of a Conservator to Transfer Property
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary
March 8, 2023
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Esteemed Colleagues of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Donna Bailey, and I proudly represent Senate District 31, 
which includes Buxton, Old Orchard Beach, and Saco. Today I am pleased to introduce my bill 
LD 751, “An Act to Clarify the Powers of a Conservator to Transfer Property.”
This bill is to clarify that anytime a conservator wishes to convey or release an interest in the 
primary dwelling of an individual subject to conservatorship, including by a transfer on death 
deed, the conservator must first obtain court approval. Currently, the probate code is silent on the 
power of a conservator to sign a transfer on death deed or other transfer that is not a sale or 
surrendering a lease. This bill would clarify that any type of conveyance or release of an interest, 
in whatever form, would necessitate prior court approval. 
Thank you for your time, I would be happy to answer any questions.
