LD 1869
I'm writing in support of LD 1869, "An Act to Prohibit the Private Funding of 
Elections." 
Twenty-four states prohibit, limit or regulate the use of private or philanthropic 
funding to run elections. All legislation on this topic has been enacted since the 2020 
election when the COVID-19 pandemic led to unexpected expenses related to mailing
and processing an increased number of absentee/mail ballots, providing larger 
in-person voting facilities to accommodate social distancing and sudden demands for 
more cleaning and hygiene supplies.
In general, elections are funded by state and local budgets, with occasional federal 
infusions. To meet the additional needs during the pandemic, philanthropic funding 
for local election offices was made available by the Center for Tech and Civic Life, 
with donations from Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan. Grants ranged from $5,000 
to $19 million.
Private funding of elections could, and did in 2020, result in the donor or 
grant-making organization having undue influence over elections and perhaps 
favoring some jurisdictions over others. In 2020 the private funding money skewed 
very disproportionately to Democratic jurisdictions, so they weren't helping 
everybody vote., they were especially helping Democratic jurisdictions vote. It is 
illegal for a donor or grant-making organization to try to get involved in that kind of 
skewing of election results. This bill would put an end to such illegal election 
influence.
I urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 1869.
