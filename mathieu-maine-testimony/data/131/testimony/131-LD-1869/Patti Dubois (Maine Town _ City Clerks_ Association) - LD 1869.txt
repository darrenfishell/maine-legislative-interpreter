Re: LD 1869 – An Act to Prohibit  the Private  Funding  of Elections  
 
Position: Neither For Nor Against 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is neither for nor against LD 1869 and we thank 
you for the opportunity to outline our points for your committee. 
 
Our members understand and appreciate the desire to avoid any influence of election 
officials, or even the perception of influence through receipt of private funding for election 
administration.   
 
In 2020, several Maine municipalities were awarded grant funds from the Center for Tech 
and Civic Life (CTCL) to be used for any election-related purchases for items intended to 
facilitate administration of a large election during an unprecedented pandemic.  The grant 
awards were at least $5,000 and over $336,000 for Maine’s largest city.   
 
The grant funds were used for various purposes on items such as the purchase of tables, 
voting booths, PPE, laptops, printers, photocopiers, laminating equipment, additional 
postage costs, additional pay and hiring of election workers, storage trailers, stanchions, 
signage, mobile message boards, and advertising. These purchases made a significant 
difference in managing a dramatic increase in absentee voting by allowing for additional 
staffing and equipment, communicating relevant and timely information to voters, along 
with covering the huge spike in postage costs.  In addition, social distancing and sanitation 
efforts were handled with adequate equipment, staffing and supplies due, in large part, to 
the funding received by these grants.   
 
To be clear, the award of these funds in no way influenced election officials in the conduct 
of the fair administration of this election.  To purport otherwise would be an attempt to 
discredit hardworking election officials across the state.  Grant funds must be accepted and 
appropriated by the municipal officials and accounted for through the municipality’s 
financials.  Simply put, the additional funding made the nearly insurmountable task of 
administering an election during the height of a pandemic possible.  Election officials should 
be lauded for their efforts, not discredited for accepting financial resources.

Members wondered how this bill may impact the use of private venues for polling location 
for no charge, or the donation of food to election staff, or the free use of a college bus to 
transport voters, or the use of volunteers as election workers since all of these would be 
equivalent to over $100 in value.   
 
With that said, the perception of influence is a serious issue and should be avoided.  Our 
members suggested the consideration of a reporting mechanism for municipalities to 
disclose private funding and donations used in the administration of elections.
