Dear Sen ator Carney and Representative  Moonen ,  
 
 My name  is Kathleen A yers , I live in West Gardiner and am   the Regi ster of 
Probate from Kennebec  and Chair of the Maine Association of Reg isters of Probate 
Legislative Committee.  
 
 The Registrars are in s upport o f changes especially if a termination  of parental 
rights has taken place in  District Court.  
 
 In those cases the facts and history of the case is in District Court usually DHHS 
case ,  Years later when the say adoptive (relative ) pare nt is ill or d ies, or if a teenager runs 
away to the pare nt that has had right s terminated  it become s a  guardianship case in 
Probate.   We think those cases should return to the court of origin for continuity.   
 
 I can provide further information if need.   
 
 
  
       You rs Very Truly ,  
 
       Kathleen G. Ayers  
       Register Kennebec County  
       Director & Legislative Chair  MAR P
