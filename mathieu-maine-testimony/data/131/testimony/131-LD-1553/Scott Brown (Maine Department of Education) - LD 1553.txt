Senator Nangle,  Representative Stover,  and Distinguished Members  of the State  and Local 
Government Committee:  
LD 1553, An Act to Mitigate So -called Forever Chemicals in Decommissioned Schools by  
Establishin g a Fund for Mitigation Projects , proposes to create the Decommissioned Schools 
Contamination Mitigation Fund under the custody of the Maine Municipal Bond Bank for the 
purpose of providing financing  to school administrative  units  for mitigating  the contamination  of 
decommissioned school properties by PFAS and other “forever chemicals.” 
The Department would like to note that the term “mitigation” is not defined in the bill. Depending on the types of processes LD 1553 intends, costs could range from installing water filters  to the full-scale removal of topsoil from athletic  fields.  The bill also does not specify  what 
entity would be responsible for the mitigation. 
This bill represents a drastic change from existing policy. Historically, the Department of 
Education (DOE)  maintains a focus on buildings and property that are actively  providing shelter 
or grounds for students. To that end, the DOE leverages resources to support new school 
construction and current school renovation projects.  The Department’s  current programs provide 
hazardous abatement funding for schools that have enrolled students. The Department has 
historically addressed cleanup of hazardous materials in state -funded school construction 
projects where abatement during renovation or demolition is required.  This does not include 
decommissioned buildings which are not part of the new building project. The Department has 
never managed funds or projects related to decommissioned school buildings, which are owned by local municipalities rather than school administrative units.  
Additionally,  LD 1553 would give the DOE  authority  to develop joint rules  and a priority  listing 
for locally owned decommissioned buildings. This authority would inappropriately supersede 
local decision making.  
Finally, should the Committee decide to pass LD 1553, a position would need to be created to 
establish  and administer  the program. The fund would need  to maintain  a healthy fund balance in
