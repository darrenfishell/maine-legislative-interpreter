A LD 804 
To Chairpersons Anne Carney, Matt Moonen, and the members of the Judiciary Committee 
0 My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham Maine. 
I I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and 
Managers Association, GBAOMA. 
0 I am also a member of the Legislative Council representing landlords and property 
owners in, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, Portland, South Portland, Lewiston, 
Auburn, and the Bangor areas. 
v I have been a landlord since 1972. I have owned a 50-unit trailer park , multi-units, and 
single-family homes. At one time, I managed 65 units. l have mostly provided 
affordable housing to low-income tenants. 
I I would like to bring to your attention the fact that this Bill will probably hurt more 
tenants than it will help. 
0 lf a tenant rents a unit and pays the ﬁrst months rent, plus two times the rent asa 
security deposit, and then for whatever reason, has to move out after the ﬁrst week, the 
tenant does not get any of his security deposit back because he did not give a ninety day 
_ notice. The landlord has no reason to look for another tenant because the rent has been 
paid for the next two months. How does this help the tenant? 
0 lf a tenant decides to leave, he will need to give his current landlord a 90-day notice. lt 
is doubtful that the new landlord will hold an available unit for 90 days while the tenants 
fulﬁlls his notice requirements. He will have to pay at least one months rent in both 
places in order to make the move. How does this help the tenant? 
~ My experience is that 30 days to terminate has worked for a long time and it may be 
better to leave it alone." 
0 l am here to ask you to consider my points, neither for nor against on LD 804. 
v Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. l would be happy to answer any 
questions.
