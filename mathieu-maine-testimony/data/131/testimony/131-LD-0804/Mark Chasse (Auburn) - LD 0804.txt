LD 804
LD 804 ought-NOT-to pass as the current time frame in this statute allows the current 
owner to expedite vacancy especially in cases where the residence has been 
compromised by damage and assists the owner in preventing more damage and 
allowing them to make repairs and get property back on the market. 
Finally, this may prevent other tenants affected by an unruly tenant from vacating as 
well because they feel threatened by another tenant.
Thank you.
