Testimony of Leo J. Delicata, Esq., Legal Services for the Elderly, in 
support of L.D. 804 An Act to Increase the Time Period for Notice to 
Terminate a Tenancy at Will before the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary,
Legal Services for the Elderly is a non-profit legal services organization that 
was established in Maine following the passage of the Older American’s Act 
pain 1974. Since then, we have provided free legal assistance to our 
disadvantaged older adults when their basic human needs are at stake.
Maine law currently requires a landlord to give tenants a written 30-day 
notice before terminating a tenancy at will without cause. This bill changes 
the time to 90 days. It does not change the 7-day eviction notice that a 
landlord can give a tenant in the event any of the conditions allowing an 
eviction “for cause”. 
This proposed change recognizes the housing crisis that is undeniably 
present in our State. And it attempts to provide a more realistic opportunity 
to find a new place to live for tenants experiencing the intense pressures 
created by circumstances over which they have little control. There is plenty 
of data that describes the challenges of living in Maine if your income is low 
or moderate and you rent your home. We have presented Statistics from 
Maine Housing in prior testimony on a similar bill but they come from a 
familiar and reliable source and are worth repeating. 
Here's an excerpt from Maine Housing’s Director Dan Brennan’s 
contribution to the Report of the Commission to Increase Housing 
Opportunities in Maine by Studying Land Use Regulations and Short-term 
Rentals (Appendix E) .

“HUD’s Fair Market Rent for a 2-bedroom is unaffordable for the average 
renter household in all areas of Maine.
41.5% of renters are cost-burdened, paying more than 30% of their 
income on housing. Low- income renters are of course hit hardest by 
cost burden.
Approximately 39,716 renter households are extremely low-income 
(at or below 30% Area Median Income).
Extremely low-income renters paying over 50% of their income on 
housing comprise 16% of all renters.
45% of all renter households are below 50% Area Median Income.
Small family renter households comprise the largest share of 
extremely low-income households.
54% of extremely low-income renters have substandard housing 
(defined as lacking complete plumbing or kitchen facilities).”
Small single parent and older adult renters face the greatest housing 
challenges and greatest need. Nearly 15% of households with at least 
one person over 75 have extremely low incomes. 36% of households 
with one or more children aged 6 or under have extremely low 
incomes or low incomes.
Maine Housing’s Federal Emergency Rental Assistance Program Data 
Dashboard Report dated December 7, 2022 is also instructive. During the  
time that it operated (March of 2021 through November 2022), the program 
disbursed $137,098,735 for rent, $87,493,956 for rent arrearages, and over 
$58,000,000 for other housing related costs. Those funds supported over 
34,000 households and provided 248,357 months of rental assistance. 
Unfortunately, that Federal rental assistance program has ended. Although it 
is still much needed, other pandemic related Federal assistance will end 
soon. The increased Federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program 
(SNAP) benefits will return to much lower pre-pandemic levels. MaineCare 
members whose eligibility was frozen by pandemic rules will begin to have 
their eligibility redetermined in April. Over the next twelve months, over 
sixty thousand to ninety thousand are estimated to lose their medical 
benefits. 
3In our work, we expect that we will see even more evictions of our retired 
adults this year. Each case carries a worrying risk of homelessness. We also 
expect to see more older adults in the workforce doing a part-time post-
retirement job just to meet rising costs.
While we are not unmindful that there are economic cost drivers that are 
problematic for higher income households, even those who own rental 
housing, we are confident that they will have more options than the more 
needy population that I have described. 
It does not seem, on balance, that extending the notice period for increasing 
a tenant’s rent is unreasonable. Finding another apartment, if your rent 
increases but your income does not, is a challenge that realistically cannot be 
met in 30 days. Given the perfect storm of high housing costs, the low stock 
of rental housing and the impending disappearance of programs keeping the 
most disadvantaged among us fed, housed and healthy, we believe that a 
policy change giving a tenant more time to avoid homelessness is a good 
idea. 
Thank you for letting me share our thoughts with you today and we hope 
that you will vote ought to pass.
