Capital Area Housing Association
LD 804
March 24, 2023
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee:
We are testifying in opposition to LD 804.
My name is Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don. I am current President of Capital Area Housing 
Association, a landlord association in Augusta area. Currently we have 197 members 
and 45 (23%) of those members live in the same building, 39 of them (20%) own 1 
unit, 150 of them (76%) own 5 units or less. We are small landlords. Most of our 
members like me have regular job or retired.  They mow the lawns, snow blow 
driveways, clean their properties, and do whatever property maintenance by 
themselves allowed by the law.
We donâ€™t like to have an empty unit that is not producing any income.
We give 30 day notice to terminate a tenancy to only the bad tenants. The most common 
reasons are;
Disturbing other tenants
Violence against other tenants
Sexual harassment of other tenants
Harassing other tenants over their race or sexual preferences
Excessive noise and just being loud at odd hours
If this bill passes, it will take 4 to 5 months to evict a bad tenant.  
We urge you to oppose LD 804.
Thank you. 
Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don
President, Capital area Housing Association                                                                       28
