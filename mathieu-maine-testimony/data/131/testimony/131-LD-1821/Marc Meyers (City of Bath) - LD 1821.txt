Testimony in support of LD 1821, An Act to Validate Certain Proceedings Authorizing the Issuance 
of Bonds and Notes by the City of Bath (.May12, 2023) 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the State & Local Government Committee, my 
name is Marc Meyers and I am City Manager for the City of Bath, located in Sagadahoc County. Thank 
you for the opportunity to provide testimony for your consideration. 
Today l amjoined by the City’s Finance Director/Assistant City Manager Juli Millett and Fire Chief 
Lawrence Renaud, humbly before this committee to ask for assistance in remedying an issue with the 
advertising of a recent bond ordinance referendum that leaves the City unable to advance its fire station 
project. 
The City’s Fire and Rescue Department responds to more than 2,000 emergency medical service calls and 
400 fire calls annually. In addition to serving Bath, the department provides full-time EMS services to the 
Towns of Arrowsic and West Bath and backup services to the Town of Woolwic-h. The City’s current fire 
station is 65 years old. The facility is too small to support the department ’s operations safely and 
professionally. The building and its infrastructure have outlived their useful life and are in need of 
replacement. 
On November 8, 2022, voters of the City of Bath voted to adopt a bond ordinance that authorized the City 
to issue up to $13,050,000 of its general obligation bonds and notes to finance the construction and 
equipping of a new ﬁre station. The community recognized the need for a new facility and the measure 
passed with 68% of the votes in support (2,731 in favor, 1,264 against with 285 blank ballots). Note." the 
bond amount is different ﬁvm what is listed on the bill. The bill includes a typo and needs to be amended to 
include the correct funding authorization. 
To ensure appropriate public notice and engagement, Section 1009 of Bath’s City Charter requires that the 
complete text of the bond ordinance be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City not less 
than 10 days nor more than l5 days prior to the election. This did not occur. As a result, the City’s bond 
counsel was unable to validate that the referendum process was in compliance with the Charter, and that 
this legal technicality could affect the marketability of the bonds. Thus, the City could not borrow funds to 
move forward with the project. 
I acknowledge our procedural misstep but Want to note that the City undertook considerable efforts to make 
voters aware of the referendum, and, judging by the turnout, were successful in notifying the public and 
effectively soliciting public participation. These efforts included:

0 Article in the Portland Press Herald and The Times Record newspapers (October 9, 2022) 
Through these efforts, the complete text of the bond ordinance was available on the City’s website more 
than three months prior to the referendum. 
This is the ﬁrst time I am before the State & Local Government Committee representing Bath, but, 
unfortunately, this is not the ﬁrst time that the City has sought the Legislature ’s assistance in remedying 
public notice issues. In 2017, City voters approved a $2.8 million local bond for street and sidewalk 
improvements, but publication occurred only four days prior to the election, not the aforementioned 10-15 
days. The Legislature supported a 2018 bill to validate the referendum result and allow the project to be 
funded and advance. 
As a result of these two issues over ﬁve years, the Bath City Council will be reviewing the City Charter 
posting and notice requirements within Chapter VI ll, Permanent Financing, and Chapter X, Initiative and 
Referendum, this year and presenting amendments for the voters’ consideration on November 7, 2023. 
Repeated missteps are inexcusable. However" , the City’s current charter language involves varied steps of 
notiﬁcation for different actions, including bond ordinances, which leads to confusion. We want to 
continue to provide public awareness and engagement opportunities, but we can also address 
inconsistencies and clarify process to the beneﬁt of our employees and the public. 
Delay is costly. To correct our current situation, the City could also have returned this matter to the voters 
again in a June referendum, but another vote takes the additional time and expense to conduct an election 
and discounts more than 4,000 votes of the original referendum in November of last year. Additionally, the 
ﬁre station project has not yet been put out to bid due to this legal issue and the rising costs of construction 
and equipment may further pause the development of this critical public safety infrastructure. 
The Legislature ’s action on this matter does not infringe upon the rights of the voters of Bath but validates 
their actions in conﬁrming this referendum vote. This bill provides the best solution to conﬁrm the results 
of the referendum and allow the City to borrow funds for construction and equipping of a new ﬁre station. 
Thanks again for a moment of your valuable time during this legislative session and the opportunity to 
provide this testimony in support of LD 1821, An Act to Validate Certain Proceedings Authorizing the 
Issuance of Bonds and Notes by the C ily of Bath.

RESOLUTION 
SUPPORTING LD 1821 
WHEREAS, Sponsor Senator VITELLI of Sagadahoc and Cosponsors; Representative PAULHUS 
of Bath, Senator NANGLE of Cumberland, and Representative I-IEPLER of Woolwich have 
proposed LD 1821 “An Act to Validate Certain Proceedings Authorizing the Issuance of Bonds 
and Notes by the City of Bath;” and 
WHEREAS, the purpose of the Legislation is to validate the results of the referendum conducted 
in the City of Bath on November 8, 2022, with regard to approval of a bond ordinance authorizing 
the issuance of up to $13,050,000 of its general obligation bonds and notes to ﬁnance the 
construction and equipping of a new ﬁre station; and 
WHEREAS, the rationale for requesting Legislative relief is as a result of a legal technicality 
concerning the bond approval procedures that prevents the bond from being marketed; and 
WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed the Legislation and the representations in the 
Legislation regarding the nature of the procedural defect and the necessity for the requested 
Legislative relief; and 
WHEREAS, the approval of this Legislation will render the bond issue marketable. 
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the City Council of the City of Bath that its approval 
of this Resolution indicates its full support for the adoption of l.82l_.H

Bath officials are trying to build support for a $13 million bond referendum to build a new fire 
station, saying that the current station is unsafe, even lacking a sprinkler system. 
They outlined the $16.5 million plans during a meeting Thursday night. 
lf the bond question passes at the polls in November, the city would borrow $13 million to 
pay for the design, construction and station equipment. The remaining $3.5 million would be 
paid for using existing tax increment financing funds. 
City councilors voted to send the bond to a referendum last August following a 2021 “reuse 
report" that named the former Morse High School as a desirable site for a new fire station. 
The current fire station, built in 1957, was deemed to be in “poor condition ” in 2009 and 
recommended for replacement in 2020 by Harriman, an architectural firm hired by the town, 
according to Bath City Manager Marc Meyers. 
“The current fire station does not meet the needs of the department, our employees or the 
services we provide to the community," Meyers said. “The proposed fire station will provide 
additional safety, security and space as well as improvements to efficiency and flow for the 
operations. ” 
Poor air quality, no sprinkler system, spaces contaminated by diesel exhaust, inadequate 
garage bays and doorways, and stacking of emergency vehicles are among the safety 
concerns at the current station.
The new station would be built on the north 
end of the former Morse High School property 
on High Street, replacing the current station at 
864 High St.

“If voters support this project, the bond will be paid back in annual payments over 25 years. 
The estimated property tax increase for a $250,000 home is $125,” Meyers said. “Due to 
recent amendments to the city’s TlF districts, we avoid borrowing an additional $3.5 million, 
which helps reduce the impact on property taxpayers. ” 
Fire Chief Lawrence Renaud said he is more than happy to answer any questions voters 
may have at a series of public open houses this month. 
“l would encourage any citizen of Bath to get involved and come visit the fire station and let 
us help you understand the need of their department to provide highly skilled, proficient, 
time-sensitive emergency medical response services, tire suppression, public education and
numerous other public safety services, ” Renaud said. 
Voters can learn more about the project at Bath Fire Department open houses at 6 p.m. Oct. 
13 and 27. 
“Over the past 65 years, the services we provide have changed, and our department 
adapted to make the current fire station work, but the time has come to make a commitment 
to a new facility, ” Meyers said. “l am hopeful voters will take the opportunity to learn more 
about the project and why we feel the new fire station is a necessary step fon/vard for Bath.” 
Bath residents will cast their vote on Election Day, Nov. 8.
