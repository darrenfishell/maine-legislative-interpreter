Testimony in support of LD 860 
April 12, 2023 
My name is Peter Cole, and I am a Topsham resident. I am testifying in support of LD 860. 
Maine needs more public transit that benefits its economy and all its citizens. 
LD 406 tells us to examine the benefits of keeping rail corridors, for rail. LD 860 looks at 
extending the passenger rail corridor to the center of the State. 
Two nights a week I volunteer with Train Riders Northeast as a station host in 
Brunswick, the third busiest station on the Downeaster Line. I meet college students going to 
Portland to see friends or going home for the weekend or end-of-term. I meet working adults 
going to their jobs or going home. I meet senior citizens traveling to Boston for medical 
appointments. I meet families traveling to the Science Museum in Boston or going to a Red Sox 
game. I meet tourists coming up to Brunswick for the day or to see old friends. I meet Maine 
residents going short distances between cities and towns in Maine, and residents going longer 
distances to catch a plane in Boston to international destinations. I see people needing and 
using rail. 
Rail is dependable year-round transportation that minimizes pollution and has a small 
footprint compared to the need to continuously widen our roads. The beauty of trains, light rail 
and all forms of public transportation extends well beyond getting from one place to another. 
The beauty extends beyond road expansion and lowering greenhouse emissions. The real 
beauty is that trains connect communities and the people within. 
Keeping Maine connected in all weather, all day, and all night long is why we need to 
support train service. That is why I support LD 406 and LD 860.
