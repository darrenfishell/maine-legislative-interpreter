I am Nancy Nicholson, a senior citizen,  and have owned a home in Bangor for 10 
years.  I wholeheartedly support the creation of a passenger rail system from Portland 
to Bangor, connecting to Boston and the Eastern Corridor.  I echo every point that 
Joseph Leonard has made on his facebook page.  I have heard that this is simply too 
expensive.  While a direct cost-analysis may look foreboding,  the actual ancillary 
benefits in terms of tourism, the creation of good jobs in the Bangor area and 
facilitating transport of anyone without a car, or who does not like to drive at night, 
would eventually put us into the black.
