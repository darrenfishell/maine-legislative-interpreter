Hello there, 
My name is Martin Skacel, and I'm a high-school student from Bangor, Maine. I am 
speaking to express my strong support for passenger rail and its potential to improve 
transportation options for working people--including the youth population of Maine. 
Transportation across Maine almost entirely comprises of automobiles or bussing 
alone. Besides these, there is no other reliable way to connect our growing rural 
communities and their populations within the state or beyond. Particularly, easier 
transportation through rail will strongly encourage young people to stay, work, and 
live in Maine. Right now, Maine is exactly what we call it: Vacationland. It brings 
people from across the country to visit for a few days or retire. However, we all know 
that Maine can be so much more than that. With the oldest population in the country, 
Maine desperately needs more young people to stay and support an economically 
prosperous future. This is the greatest economic concern Maine currently faces. If 
Maine wants to attract more young people, it must provide them with what makes 
them stay. And it starts with better transportation options. My optimistic and 
environmentally conscious generation needs tools such as easier transportation to stay
and work in Maine. Each week, my dad travels from Bangor to Portland. He drives. 
My sister currently lives and works in Portland. She drives to Bangor and back. She's 
23. Just like me, she's part of Maine's young population. A rail system to connect the 
communities of Maine would provide ease of transport and draw young people to the 
state--confirming Maine as a pioneer in the future of transportation, which is public. If
Maine wants to be more than just "Vacationland," it needs to cater to a transportation 
system that supports more than just vacationing. This starts with the youth population,
and it starts with rail transportation. Thank you.
