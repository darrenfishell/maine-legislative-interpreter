LD 860
Greetings!
The testimony being submitted is regarding LD 860 - An Act to Identify the Railroad 
Lines from Portland to Bangor as a Major Corridor and to Fund a Feasibility Study. 
As residents of Bangor, my partner and I are in full support of bringing passenger rail 
service to our Historic Queen City for the following reasons:
Ease of Traveling; Creating Social Equity; Retaining and Attracting Younger 
Residents and Families who, by choice or not, do not own a vehicle; Fighting Climate
Change; Physical and Mental Wellness; Reducing Traffic Congestion; Creating Better
Active Transportation in our Towns; as well as Creating Economic Growth for the 
cities of Bangor, Augusta, Waterville and their surrounding regions. 
The car should only be an optional instrument of freedom that should not be a 
required prosthetic device. 
I (Dominick) grew up in New York City where I fortunately got to enjoy the benefits 
of the ease of traveling by having access to every form of transportation. It is a very 
fair, equitable system that works. If there was an issue with one form of 
transportation, you could always rely on having other options to help get you to your 
destination. 
My partner and I would definitely use the service and drive less, not just to get around
Maine but also to take it beyond to visit family/friends in New York and elsewhere. In
addition, as more Bangor region residents are referred to medical facilities in Portland
and Boston, having a pretty reliable transportation system year-round including 
during the sometimes-harsh winter months takes a big chunk of stress out of an 
extremely stressful time in oneâ€™s life. If any of you have traveled I-95 in the winter 
when roads have suddenly iced over, you know what I mean.
Please support LD860!
We thank you for this opportunity! 
Sincerely,
Dominick A. Rizzo and Steven J. Bouchard
