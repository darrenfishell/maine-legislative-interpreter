Re:  In Support of LD 860

Dear Senator Ben Chipman and Representative Lynn Williams and other Members 
of the Committee. 
  
My name is Richard Rudolph.  I am a Portland resident who has served as the chair 
of Amtrak’s National Customer Advisory Committee, and currently serve on the 
Maine Rail Group's Board of Directors and chair the Rail Users Network which 
represents long distance, commuter and transit rail riders all across America.  
  
I am here today to ask you to support LD 860. This bill will provide funding for a 
feasibility study to restore passenger rail service to Bangor and the other cities in 
central Maine.  During the preceding legislature session, Senator 
Baldacci sponsored a similar bill, LD 227, which called for a feasibility study of 
the two passenger rails routes that emanate from Portland to Bangor.  During the 
work session, the Maine Department of Transportation instead offered to help pay 
for a propensity study after concluding a feasibility study would cost too 
much.  The $200,000 propensity study, which was funded by MeDOT and the 
three principal cities, Bangor, Waterville and Augusta, was a good first 
step.  However, it, failed to provide sufficient information regarding potential 
ridership on either rail line.  The propensity study used street light data to 
determine current ridership via car or bus to and from Portland.   It did not consider 
the potential new ridership or the economic benefits to central Maine.  It also failed 
to address the issues of social and economic equity for seniors and others in 
Central Maine who do not have the ability or access to travel by car.  This limits 
their access to medical care as well as cultural events in other cities. The current 
commercial bus system leaves passengers off several miles out of the downtowns 
of most cities.    
  
Restoration of passenger service from Brunswick to Waterville and Bangor will 
contribute to an array of economic benefits.  New jobs will be created from the 
construction, restoration and on-going operation of the service.  Enhanced 
transportation options will also encourage young people to stay and grow the 
economy and attract families who cannot afford housing in Southern 
Maine.  Passenger rail service with last mile connections will enable state 
legislators and others who are seeking to testify on bills to attend 
legislative sessions without using their cars.   Thousands of students would have 
easy access to the nine colleges and universities in central Maine.  Restoration of 
train service will also help reduce carbon emissions, alleviate congestion and 
reduce accidents on Rt. 95 / 295.  The new service will also bring more ridership to 
the Downeaster and Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor service.  
  
Maine hosted 15.3 million visitors last years who spent $8.6 billion dollars.  With 
last mile connections to museums and Acadia National Park, even more will come. 
The transportation links would also provide options for tour companies other than 
mega buses and cruise ships. 
  
We have reached the point of no return. The current MeDOT work plan includes 
funds to convert the State-owned rail lines including, the “Lower Road”, in 2023 
into recreational bicycle / walking paths.  Large sums have been 
allocated: $8,000,000 in 2023 and $11,000,000 in 2024, yet there is minimal 
money allocated to expand passenger train services.  Maine has an opportunity that 
other New England States have recognized and acted upon. Two prime examples 
are the new service from Rutland to Burlington, Vermont and the extension of 
service to Greenfield and Northampton, Massachusetts. 
  
The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Railroad Administration has 
established a new Corridor Identification program which is creating a pipeline of 
projects ready for funding over the next five years.  With our support, passage of 
LD 860 will enable the state to analyze the viability of restoring passenger rail 
service to Bangor and the other major cities in central Maine and to apply for 
federal funds to restore passenger service to that area of the state.  Imagine!  This 
would put 90% of the state’s population within one hour distance of a railroad 
station! 
  
Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. 
  
Sincerely, 
 Richard Rudolph
