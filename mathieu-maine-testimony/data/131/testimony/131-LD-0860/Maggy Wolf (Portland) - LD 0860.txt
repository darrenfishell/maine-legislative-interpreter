Maggy Wolf
Portland
LD 860
My name is Maggy Wolf and I strongly support LD 860 to identify corridors from 
Portland to Bangor, including connecting inland communities by rail service. I 
already enjoy taking the Downeaster from Portland to Boston but would love to take 
it to other Maine cities. We need to open up more parts of the state to rail service, and 
to study where rail service would remove cars from roads, and where it would open 
access to more Maine cities.
