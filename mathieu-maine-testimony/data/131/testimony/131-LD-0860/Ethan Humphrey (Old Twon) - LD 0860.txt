Senator Chipman, representative Williams and members of the transportation 
committee Hello, my name is Ethan Humphrey and I am an Old Town resident and I 
am here to express my support for passenger rail and its potential benefits to the state 
of maine. The expansion and development of passenger rail lines in the state gives us 
the opportunity to improve maines accessibility to the rest of the U.S, provide an 
affordable form of transportation that reduces carbon emissions and promotes the 
tourism industry, and create jobs. 
The expansion of the rail line to bangor would give Maine greater access to the 
interstate rail systems and vice versa. As a newly admitted student of the University 
of Vermont, this extension would greatly ease my ability to travel to and from school 
and home, and encourage me to return to Maine once my education is finished. 
Travelling by rail is significantly less expensive than flying, so extending and 
creating more routes would give the tourism industry greater access to maine 
busnineses, which in turn would boost our economy. It would also make living in the 
state of Maine more attractive long term, and possibly lead to the creation of new 
businesses, and higher enrollment rates in many of our state's esteemed colleges. 
   It is also worth noting that higher usages of the rail system means less vehicles on 
our roads, which would lessen carbon emissions.  Thank you for your time, Do you 
have any questions?
