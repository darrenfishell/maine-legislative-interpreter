I am a disabled woman 69 years old and own a home in Bangor, Maine for 36 years. 
Due to Healthcare issues I can only drive locally. I take Concord busses, and transfer 
to the Amtrak to visit my family and also to attend to business relating to my 
business, Maine Jewelry & Art. 
I am writing to express my strong support for public rail service up to Bangor. 
Passenger rail can help senior citizens travel more safely and comfortably, 
particularly for those like myself who may have health issues. It's difficult also for me
to sit 8+ hours on the bus to NYC.
I believe that investing in passenger rail is both economically beneficial and an 
important way to meet the needs of seniors like myself. I've lived in several cities in 
Europe and Scandinavia, where railservice is the predominant form of transportation. 
Trains run on time to this day and are very affordable. We can learn from these 
countries.
And passenger rail can help the environment. As an organizer and lobbyist I spent a 
few years commuting daily by car from Bangor to the State Capitol in Augusta. Many
times I would pass Legislators and fellow colleagues on the highway going and 
coming home. Many times. All those cars driving with one person! All that gas & 
waste! To me it's totally nonsensical that we cannot take a train to Augusta. I 
remember trying to car pool to save on gas; which became another part-time job as 
people wanted their own cars in those days.
Thank you for your consideration and for the good work you do.
Sincerely,
Roxanne Munksgaard
