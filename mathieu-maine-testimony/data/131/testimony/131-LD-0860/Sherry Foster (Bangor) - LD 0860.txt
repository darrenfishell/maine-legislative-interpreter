Sherry Foster Ld 860 bill 
Senator Chipman, representative Williams, and members of the transportation committee 
My name is Sherry Foster and I am a Bangor resident 
Hi everyone, I appreciate your time and thank you for listening to what my peers and l have to 
say about the railroad bill. Today l’m here to express my strong support for this railroad bill, 
which will build railway systems from Bangor to portland. This railroad system has many 
benefits such as that it requires less fuel and puts out less emissions than the many cars that go 
daily from Bangor to portland. This more eco-friendly method of travel can also promote social 
equity since having andlor affording your own car and being able to transport yourself to where 
you need to go is oftentimes a privilege that many don’t have, therefore this railway system will 
be able to reach and benefit those who don’t have that privilege. This would ensure that 
everyone has an opportunity to get from Bangor to Portland and vice versa safely and timely. 
This railway will also create job opportunities and economic growth for many Maine residents 
not only during the construction process but also after, in which there will need to be people 
employed to run, manage, and maintain the railway. The railway will also open up so many more 
opportunities other than job opportunities, they will provide access and create a strong sense of 
community connecting people and families from all over the state stretching from Bangor to 
Portland. Which is something I think the world and specifically Maine could use especially right 
now. Thank you for listening and for your time and consideration. 
Are there any questions
