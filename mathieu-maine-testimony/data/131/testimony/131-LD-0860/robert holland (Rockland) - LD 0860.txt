LD 860
There are few true economic development opportunities that the state can pursue.   
Development of intra and inter state rail service beyond Brunswick to the north will - 
as in many other situations - spur economic development.  Saco/Bidderford is the 
most recent example here in state.
Service should be a natural extension of service beyond Brunswick and make better 
use of the Brunswick service facility.  Numerous colleges are along the route.  Just 
look at the University of New Hampshire at Durham.  Out of state, the Amtrack 
station at Kingston, RI is very active with the URI students as I have witnessed first 
hand.  
Their autos move from the campus over to the railroad station on 
weekends!  I have contacted bus lines along the route.  Their is keen interest in having
the rails to Bangor.  Especially to Acadia.  It is beyond time to get serious about rail 
passenger extensions northward.
Support for LD860 is a no brainer.  It will prove to be a prudent and precious use of 
state funds over the long haul. I have 50 years of direct involvement with the rail 
industry.  Respectfully, Robert E Holland
