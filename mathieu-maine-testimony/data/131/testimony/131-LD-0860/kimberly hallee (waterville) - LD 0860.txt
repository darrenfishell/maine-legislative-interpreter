LD 860
Bill L D 860 will provide funding for a feasibility study to restore passenger rail 
service to Bangor and other cities in Central Maine. Efforts to ensure our 
communities sustainability in areas that encompass some of "the other Maine" must 
be taken. Passenger rail from Brunswick to Bangor is a great beginning to ensure 
quality of life is continued! A reduction in carbon emissions, reduction in traffic 
congestion and accidents, job creation, housing opportunity, an increase in a more 
youthful population, and ease of destination to arts, higher education facility and our 
healing and heathy natural  environment will be benefits of passenger rail. My 70 y/o 
temperament seeks public transportation for a host of reasons. Passenger rail is an old 
form of transportation  that must be restored to serve all ages whether we hope to "age
in place", retain or secure more youth, grow our families or grow our economy. Let's 
not forget "the little engine that could" because we should pass L D 860 and expand  
passenger rail. Thank You. Kimberly Hallee
