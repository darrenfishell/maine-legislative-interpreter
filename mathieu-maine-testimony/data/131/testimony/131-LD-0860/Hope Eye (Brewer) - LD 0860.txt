Hello honorable legislators. I am a resident of Bangor. I’ve lived here my entire life. 
Saying that, I need you all to know how much of a nightmare it has been to not have 
reliable public transport from here to Portland. There are so many opportunities down 
there for young people like me (I’m 30). But here’s the issue, not many people can 
stay here if they work down in Portland. In addition, there is a housing crisis in 
Portland especially. I’ve seen people my age leave in droves. Always stating that they
would stay here and only work in Portland. I want to stay in Bangor. But I can’t do 
well with my skill set unless I work further south. If we had a commuter rail, I could 
easily commute to Portland, and bring that money back to us here in Bangor. So many
people my age would do the same. That’s the issue with a lot of folks in my 
generation, and a big reason for the mass exodus out of Bangor, and Maine as well. A 
rail system to Portland from Bangor would expand access for those not only coming 
from Bangor, but coming to as well! People living outside our state borders would 
more easily and comfortably get here. We could see a greater economic boom to our 
tourism industry, as well as further economic development spurred by easier access to
human capital. More people would stay here, not feeling as isolated as we younger 
folks in Bangor have been throughout our lives. Please. Expand the railway. Let’s 
further Maines development together.
