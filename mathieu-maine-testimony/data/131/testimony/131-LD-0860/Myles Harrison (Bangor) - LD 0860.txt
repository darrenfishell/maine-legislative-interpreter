Passenger Service Rail Testimony - Myles Harrison
Hello Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and members of the Transportation
Committee, 
My name is Myles Harrison, and I'm a high-school student from Bangor, Maine. I am 
speaking here today to express my strong support for LD 860 and passenger rail and 
its potential to stimulate economic growth as well as its popularity among young 
people.
As a young person myself who is looking at college in the future I, along with many 
others, would love a train system that runs from Portland to Bangor that is both 
convenient and accessible.
As the next generation of workers, students, and community members, young people 
are keenly aware of the importance of sustainable transportation options and the need 
for reliable, affordable, and convenient transportation choices.
Passenger rail has become increasingly popular among young people, who appreciate 
its many benefits, including its environmental sustainability, affordability, and 
convenience. Students out of state who don’t have a car or students who can’t pay for 
a car would love the idea of a passenger rail service. Passenger rail can help young 
people travel to school, work, and social events, reducing car needs and promoting 
more sustainable transportation choices. Furthermore, passenger rail offers a reliable 
and efficient mode of transportation, reducing traffic congestion, air pollution, and 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
With the popularity among the young people also comes an increase in economic 
growth.
Passenger rail infrastructure investment can create jobs, improve transportation 
connectivity, and support local businesses, leading to economic growth and 
prosperity.
Expanding passenger rail services can create jobs in a range of industries, from 
construction and engineering to manufacturing and operations. These jobs can provide
stable employment opportunities and help to support local economies.
Passenger rail can improve transportation connectivity, making it easier for people to 
travel to work, school, and other destinations. This can help to attract new businesses 
and investment to areas served by passenger rail, promoting economic development 
and growth.
In conclusion, investing in passenger rail infrastructure is not only a smart economic 
choice but also a vital step toward meeting the transportation needs of young people. 
By expanding passenger rail services, we can help to promote more sustainable 
transportation choices and build stronger, more connected communities for future 
generations. 
Thank you for your time. Do you have any questions?
