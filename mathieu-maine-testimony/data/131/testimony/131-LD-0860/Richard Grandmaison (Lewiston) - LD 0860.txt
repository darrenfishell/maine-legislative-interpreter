My name is Richard Grandmaison and I live in Lewiston. I have been actively 
working as a volunteer in support of developing passenger rail service for about 13 
years. I was encouraged by the former US Representative Mike Michaud.

the time has come for the Department of Transportation to determine the best use of 
the hundreds of miles of railroad corridors that the State of Maine owns. 
All forms of transportation help create economic development, not just highways. 
Besides, the entire State of Maine needs to be considered when plans to expand and 
develop systems of transportation such as passenger rail to benefit all Maine residents.
It's also important to know the real value of all state-owned rail lines.

LD 860 is clearly a major step in the right direction. We need to pass LD 860 for the 
future and benefit for all Maine citizens.
In the 13 years that I have been involved, I have spoken to hundreds of citizens at 
several Liberty Fetivals held in Lewiston. Most were from Androscoggin County, 
some from Axford and Somerset County. the vast majority said they wanted a 
passenger rail service to Lewiston, and the certainly would use it to got Portland, Old 
Orchard Beach, and Boston.
the plan to provide services all the way to Bangor will have an important impact on 
all the communities within a short distance to the train stations. Individuals, in those 
areas will take advantage to travel to various locations for entertainment and many 
other activities.
Maine is a beautiful state, and the time has come to make it accessible not only for 
our residents, but also visitors from other states and even from foreign countries.
Using the CSX line works, and it leaves an opportunity to use the St. Lawrence and 
Atlantic corridor from Danvill Junction to Yarmouth Junction for possible rail service
from Montreal. that section could also be used for rail services and a walking trail.
