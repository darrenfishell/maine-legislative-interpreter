LD 2
Hi, 
My name is Colin Vettier and I live in Portland, Maine. As a resident of the city, my 
encounter with homelessness, its stigmas and its intersectional issues (drug abuse, 
mental illness, etc.) daily. I believe that we can do a lot better than this for our 
community (and by community, I include our members who have to live without a 
home). 
In my opinion, we need to provide funding for the 24-hour-a-day supportive services 
that make Site-based Housing First a successful solution for people with complex 
needs experiencing chronic homelessness. 
I am in favor of LD 2 and hope that it will come into action ASAP so we can start 
addressing the housing crisis.
