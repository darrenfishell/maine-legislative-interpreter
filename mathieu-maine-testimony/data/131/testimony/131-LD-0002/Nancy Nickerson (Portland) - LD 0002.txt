LD 2
I am a resident of Portland, Maine, and write today in support of LD 2, an Act to 
Address Maine's Housing Crisis, and specifically, to address the need for "Site-based 
Housing First." 
This bill, sponsored by Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, will provide funding for the 
24-hour-a-day supportive services that make Site-based Housing First an effective 
and successful solution for highly vulnerable populations, including the chronically 
homeless.  Many of these people also experience untreated mental and behavioral 
health issues and/or substance use disorders. Once people are safe and supported by 
24-hour onsite social work staff in permanent housing, they can stabilize and work 
toward a more fulfilling and independent future,  including addressing substance use 
disorder, focusing on health, education, or employment, and rebuilding relationships 
with friends and family.  
This bill is a step toward ending long-term, chronic homelessness in our state, and 
deserves our support.
Thank you.
