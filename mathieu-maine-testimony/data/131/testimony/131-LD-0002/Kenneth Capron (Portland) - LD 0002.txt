Executive Summary
The United States, and especially its coastal cities, is facing an affordable hous-
ing crisis. Nearly 7 million United States citizens face unreliable access to affordable
housing. In certain metropolitan regions, rent expenses exceed 40% of the median res-
ident’s gross income. Thus, alternative methods are required in order to narrow this
disconcerting supply-demand gap.
As a result of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the cruise industry was forced to
significantly curtail operations. This development, coupled with the increasingly strin-
gent emissions standards levied by various environmental organizations, has placed a
large supply of cruise ships on the market to be sold, or simply discarded outright. This
conversion project assessed the utility and feasibility of converting a decommissioning
cruise ship into an affordable housing community, with the stated requirements of pro-
viding affordable, dignified, and desirable housing on a vessel that could potentially be
relocated.
A baseline cruise ship variant was selected based on criteria derived from the
sponsor requirements. A corresponding 3D model was used to reflect weight change
estimates and evaluate the vessel’s performance against hydrostatics and stability cri-
teria. 2D deck plan layouts were used as the basis for arrangement modifications.
In total, the design proposed 246 affordable housing units following a mixed-income
model that were able to accommodate approximately 350 people. The remaining decks
were modified to provide all the additional amenities, facilities, and furnishings deemed
necessary in order to provide an overall desirable living space. To provide the major
utilities required for onboard living ( i.e. electricity, water, sewage), significant but
essential investments in pierside and shipboard infrastructure and equipment upgrades
were analyzed and proposed to allow the cruise ship to connect to the city’s power,
water, and waste distribution systems on a permanent basis.
Cost estimates for all aspects of the conversion process were determined using
comparable historical data and subject matter expert (SME) input. Capital costs
including acquisition and refurbishment were assumed to be covered through various
governmental funding mechanisms which already exist for affordable housing ventures.
The expected annual rent revenue was predicted to fall just short of the total annual
operational costs. This deficit could be accounted for with a marginal increase in
additional public funding or slightly more favorable utility discount rates.
This project determined that the conversion of a cruise ship into an affordable
housing community is feasible, and offers crucial advantages over comparable land-
based approaches. The elimination of new construction, the existing habitable ar-
rangements, and the availability of large-volume spaces for amenities suggest a com-
pelling candidate to creatively address the affordable housing shortage besetting scores
of cities and millions of citizens across the country. Future research and analysis are
recommended to address the following key areas: comprehensive reviews of relevant
regulations, zoning laws, and safety codes; detailed space and engine room analyses re-
quiring high-fidelity models and drawings; corrosion control and periodic maintenance
strategy; alternative energy supplementation to reduce utility cost.

1. Project Overview
1.1 Introduction
Many large metropolitan areas have a greater demand for affordable housing than
supply. In the U.S. alone there are 7 million renters whose income necessitates access
to affordable housing, but this housing does not exist for them[14]. Without adequate
affordable housing, the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) slows and the econ-
omy suffers. According to research, the lack of sufficient affordable housing “costs
the American economy about $2 trillion a year in lower wages and productivity[15]” .
Thus, alternative methods for addressing this problem are required in order to narrow
this disconcerting supply-demand gap. Since the onset of the 2020 coronavirus pan-
demic, many cruise ship companies have been forced to significantly curtail operations.
Consequently, this placed a large supply of cruise ships on the market to be sold, or
simply discarded outright. In 2020 alone the amount of scrapped steel from cruise ships
totalled 963,577 tons[2].
Unsurprisingly, many highly populated areas in need of more affordable living
options reside next to bodies of water. In fact, the three cities with the largest affordable
housing deficits in the United States are New York, NY, Los Angeles, CA, & Miami,
FL[16]. Therefore, the idea has been proposed to turn a cruise ship from temporary,
resort-style living quarters into temporary or even full-time residences.
Initial investigation into the idea of cruise ship conversion to affordable housing
revealed previous explorations into the concept but no full-fledged efforts to actually
reify the concept. The architecture firm CallisonRTKL (CRTKL) proposed the idea
to address the affordable housing crisis in Miami in a report released in 2022[17]. In
that rendering, a portion of the ship would be retrofitted with a parking garage and
interior courtyard to permit natural lighting and plants.
In 2019, Oakland City Council President Rebecca Kaplan proposed the cruise ship
to affordable housing conversion idea in order to provide housing for up to 1,000 people
in her city where homelessness rates had spiked 47% in the preceding two years[18].
Although the Port of Oakland ultimately proved to be an untenable docking option
due to federal regulations, the idea nonetheless gained traction with many residents of
the city who wished to address the mounting social and public health issue.
Four years ago, Portland, Maine resident Kenneth A. Capron applied for a
$250,000 grant through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in order to study the
feasibility of docking a cruise ship to address his city’s homelessness crisis[19]. At
the time of his grant proposal, the city had a waiting list of 1,123 families in need of
low-income housing. His study aimed to analyze the purchase point ranges, the cost of
refurbishing the ship to make it ready for housing, and what sort of population base the
ship would best serve ( i.e.mixed income residents, low-income workers, the unhoused,
or some combination thereof).
Furthermore, although the idea of dedicated afloat housing is relatively new, the
practice of temporary housing in times of need ( e.g. natural disasters), is not. In
fact, the U.S. Navy has lent such aid in the past. In October 1989 the USS PELELIU

(LHA 5) was sent to San Francisco to provide temporary housing for much of the
city’s homeless population following the Loma Prieta earthquake[20]. Cruise ships
specifically have also been used for this purpose. Three Carnival cruise ships provided
relief for those recovering from Hurricane Katrina, and the Holland America Line MS
Volendam provided temporary residences for Ukrainian refugees following the Russian
invasion of Ukraine in May 2022[21][22].
1.2 Study Objectives
The objective of this conversion project is to analyze and determine the feasibility
of converting a cruise ship into a viable affordable living space. Key areas of study were
identified which directed the research and design process. These insights are provided
below.
Key Insights
•Arrangements . Determine what major spaces and equipment need to be removed
or modified, and what needs to be retained, in order to support conversion to an
affordable housing community.
•Habitability . Determine the major design decisions and considerations necessary
to convert the existing hotel-style cabins into apartments suitable for longer-term
living.
•Support Systems . What pierside and shipboard infrastructure and equipment
needs to be put in place or upgraded (with respect to shore power, water, sewage
etc.) to support long-term docking of this type of vessel? How will these addi-
tional costs be accounted for?
•Cost. Determine the affordability of purchasing a cruise ship from the parent
company. Determine the affordability of the overall conversion and refurbishment
process. Will it be feasible to establish a rent revenue stream that remains
affordable while covering all annual operational and support costs? When all
costs are considered, how does this proposal perform against a comparable land-
based apartment complex?

1.3 Customer Requirements
The project sponsor did not provide specific customer requirements with respect
to baseline cruise ship specifications, expected housing accommodations, per-unit cost,
or overall conversion cost. Instead, a more holistic approach was adopted by the sponsor
wherein the driving motivation was to provide “affordable, dignified, and desirable
living” to address the affordable housing crisis besetting many American cities today.
Beyond that, there were a few strict requirements placed on the final design:
The converted design shall retain the ability to be “relocatable” to a certain
extent. This requirement was issued not only to address the scenario of an extreme
weather event requiring undocking and sortie, but also to address permanent site re-
location due to potential untenable increases in docking lease prices at the origin site.
The project sponsor described this requirement through four levels of increasing com-
plexity and capability as follows, the full details of which are provided below.
Level I. Ability to transit the vessel across the harbor. Short transit time and
distance permits accurate weather and tide predictions prior to the movement evolu-
tion, so intact stability requirements are less stringent. Self-propulsion not required.
Level II. Ability to transit the vessel to some other location along the same ref-
erence seaboard. For example, if the original host location were somewhere in Boston,
the vessel would be able to be transported to some other port along the United States
eastern seaboard. Although the transit would be longer than the Level I scenario, it
would still be short enough to permit accurate weather and tide predictions prior to
the movement evolution. Self-propulsion not required.
Level III. Ability to transit the vessel across the open ocean, possibly to an
international location. Given the longer timescale and distances assumed in this sce-
nario, accurate weather cannot be assumed a priori and therefore stricter stability
requirements must be invoked. Self-propulsion not required.
Level IV. Ability to transit the vessel anywhere in the world organically. Self-
propulsion required.
Level I relocatability was deemed mandatory by the project sponsor, and thus
was treated as the requirement threshold. Level II was deemed highly desirable, and
thus was treated as the requirement objective. Levels III and IV were recognized as
generally desirable goals, but were not considered further throughout this conversion
study.
Analysis of these baseline requirements yielded derived requirements, or the re-
quirements that need to be met so that the customer requirements are achieved. The
itemized list of given requirements with their derived requirements is as follows:
1. The per-month base unit price must be affordable based on the widely accepted
“affordable housing” definition, wherein the occupant is paying no more than
30% of gross income for housing costs, including utilities[23].
1.1 Cost comparison and determination is dependent on geographic region;
therefore, a specific city and port will need to be used so the values for
per-unit pricing have a reference.
3
1.2 The final proposal must be comparable to housing complexes built on land
for the same target population.
2. The design shall have a primary and backup source of power, and shall maintain
at least some portion of the onboard electrical power and distribution capability
in order to provide power while being relocated (disconnected from shore power).
1.4 Major Assumptions
The following assumptions served as the entering arguments for the actual design
decision, conception exploration, and concept development phases of the project. They
were informed by the initial research conducted at the beginning of the conversion
study, and were influenced primarily by common feedback received from subject matter
experts (SME), the project sponsor, and the course instructors.
Capital Cost Funding. The venture has the full backing and approval of
city and state governments such that relevant housing grants and subsidies would be
provided to finance all of the upfront, capital fixed costs. This includes cost of vessel
purchase, initial refurbishment and modification costs, and cost of any initial pier
infrastructure upgrades to support the converted cruise ship.
Regulatory Approval. Any and all requirements and regulations that would
need to be waived, modified, or approved by city housing authorities, the United States
Coast Guard, relevant ship class societies, and any other relevant entities have been
addressed as necessary.
Service Life. The average service life of a well-built and well-maintained cruise
ship is approximately 30 years. However, this vessel will be docked in-port at all times
except for the rare circumstances requiring sortie or permanent relocation, for which
self-propulsion will still not be required. Because of the drastic narrowing in operational
profile, the assumed projected service life of the chosen vessel, after conversion, will be
an additional 30 years. This is driven almost entirely by the structural integrity of the
hull and ship internals.

2. Design Decisions and Framework
2.1 Design Philosophy
The design philosophy for this project was to create affordable and desirable
housing by efficiently using available space and minimizing cost as much as possible.
This philosophy manifested itself in the following list of priorities:
1.Anchor to affordability. Develop a reliable and sound approach to defining
affordability and stick to that definition moving forward. Ensure that the base
unit pricing remains tethered to that definition even if that requires revising
design decisions.
2.Do not sacrifice desirability. The housing environment created in this project
needs to be comparable to similar housing in the local area and be somewhere
that people want to live. If desirability is not prioritized the project will do
nothing to help solve the housing crisis.
3.Minimize conversion complexity. A cruise ship is in many ways already
well-suited to accommodate people’s basic living needs, which is frankly why this
conversion idea has even been proposed. Therefore, it is a point of emphasis
to retain as much existing infrastructure, usable spaces, and support systems as
possible, which, in turn, will simultaneously drive down overall conversion costs
and increase desirability.
2.2 Design Parameters
The full list of design parameters and associated threshold and objective values
we determined for the final conversion design have been listed in Table 9 in Appendix
C. The affordability criterion was derived from the definition of affordable housing as
discussed previously. The desirability parameters were determined from the Miami
survey and similar articles in Boston of the most desired amenities in an apartment
complex[2][24][25]. Relocatability was a sponsor-defined requirement as described in
Section 1.3.
2.3 Evaluation and Decision Framework
Region and Site Location
One of the early design decisions was determining which city and docking location
would serve as the host site for the converted cruise ship. The project sponsor was
largely lenient in which city was chosen, a reflection of the fact that the affordable
housing problem is a common one throughout the entire United States, especially
for waterfront cities. Given the proximity to the research team, the relatively high
cost of living and housing, the existing cruise port infrastructure and facilities, and
the infrequency of extreme weather events which would require undocking and sortie,
Boston, Massachusetts was chosen as the host city.
Next, a more specific site location had to be determined. The first natural candi-

date was the Flynn Cruiseport, located on the southern tip of Boston’s Seaport district.
The port is owned and operated by the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), and
handled 402,346 passengers across 138 port calls, 34 different ships, and 21 different
cruise lines in 2019 alone[26]. There are currently three berths specifically allotted for
cruise ship docking as shown in Figures 2 & 3.
Figure 2: Flynn Cruiseport frequently operates at maximum capacity, with all three
cruise berths reserved for arriving or departing vessels.
In order to better assess the feasibility of docking the converted cruise ship on
a permanent or semi-permanent basis at one of these berths, there was extensive con-
sultation done with Massport subject matter experts regarding the port’s capital pro-
grams, infrastructure, utilities, and operations. From a scheduling perspective, port
officials indicated the infeasibility of being able to dock a vessel there on a permanent or
even semi-permanent basis. During the port’s peak season, which runs primarily from
September to November, the berths are generally at full capacity on a daily basis[27].
This high-volume schedule is planned out months ahead, and the revenue generated
from docking these cruise ships provides a major profit stream for the Massport or-
ganization. For these reasons Flynn Cruiseport was eliminated as a possible location
for the converted cruise ship to be docked; therefore, an alternate location had to be
determined.
To this end, our Massport contacts also provided detailed information regarding
the use of North Jetty Pier (located just north of Flynn Cruiseport) and the cruise ship
Grand Celebration for emergent temporary housing in 2018 to accommodate hundreds
of out-of-state workers brought in to repair a ruptured gas line. A full description of
theGrand Celebration’s repurposing to emergency housing is provided in Appendix F.

This real-world example demonstrated proof-of-concept viability of using North Jetty
Pier to dock a cruise ship on a semi-permanent basis, and focused our research efforts
by assuming that this would be the host location for the converted cruise ship design.

Utilities
Another key design decision was determining how to best provide major utilities
(power, water, sewage, etc.) for the ship’s future residents. The team conducted
extensive research and comparative analysis of the main options available, such as using
the installed systems onboard to the greatest extent possible, or taking advantage of
land-based water and power distribution systems to which the ship could connect, as is
often the case when vessels are docked. We conducted a thorough investigation into the
feasibility of investing in shore-to-ship power (SSP, “shore power”) technology as the
long-term power solution for this proposal. These findings are provided in Appendix
A.

Defining Affordability
Addressing the affordable housing shortage requires going beyond just taking
homeless people off the street; instead, it demands a more comprehensive approach
to understanding the socioeconomic conditions of a given region and tailoring the
potential solutions accordingly. At the same time, certain simplifying assumptions had
to be made in order to arrive at a target cost per unit which would heavily influence a
variety of other design factors.
In order to determine a common definition and value for “affordable housing”,
the description provided by the United States Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment (HUD) was used as a starting point. Under this definition, the occupant
pays no more than 30% of gross income for housing costs, including utilities[23].
It is assumed that this occupant earns the mean per-capita income in Boston of
$50,344, which is based on U.S. Census Bureau Data aggregated from 2017 to 2021[28].
Applying the above definition and dividing by a per-monthly basis yields a housing unit
target monthly cost of $1,259. For reference, the actual median gross rent during that
same period was $1,783[28]. This is $524 in excess of the desired 30% threshold and
represents 42.4% of the mean income earner’s gross income.
Defining Desirability
Defining what constituted “desirable” living emerged as one of the central chal-
lenges in determining suitable cabin and deck modifications. Absolute minimum re-
quirements were derived from the Massachusetts Sanitary Code, which provides a list
of rules and regulations for housing in the state. Code of Massachusetts Regulation
105 (105 CMR) states that each unit must have at least 150 square feet of total space
for one tenant[29]. For each additional tenant, the unit needs another 100 square feet.
Moreover, the room must get natural light from a window that is equal to at least 8 %
of the floor space.
To actually provide a “desirable” alternative housing solution, the team assessed
that the allotted square footage had to be at least in a comparable range to the av-
erage housing options currently available to city residents. To this end, research was
conducted to determine what the average size and rent price were for studio and one-
bedroom apartments in various Boston neighborhoods, as well as the city writ large, in
order to gain a better understanding of the expectations that a median income renter
may have when considering the prospect of living onboard a converted cruise ship. A
summary of these findings is provided in Table 1.
The underlying socioeconomic reality is that certain neighborhoods are simply
more expensive than others, and that the assumed average income earner previously
described may not correspond to the average renter in any one of these given neigh-
borhoods. Nonetheless, these data provide useful insights to guide further assumptions
and design decisions. For example, Beacon Hill and North End studio renters’ monthly
housing costs are proximal to the city’s median gross rent, and thus those correspond-
ing apartment sizes represent a first-pass approximation of desirable unit sizes for the
converted cruise ship. Moreover, by anchoring the base unit monthly rent to meet
the “affordable housing” definition, the converted cruise ship base units will be more

desirable from a strictly economic perspective.
It was initially believed that the primary target demographic for this proposed
housing would be individual renters with assumed earnings mirroring that of the median
income earner described above. However, the project sponsor indicated the desire for
there to be a range of housing options made available in order to meet renter demand
across a range of income levels. Specifically, there needed to be affordable options for
the majority of individuals and families who fall at or below the median income earning
level. This would likely manifest itself in having to consider a range of housing unit
layouts whose rent values roughly corresponded to the unit size.
Although a principal concern, unit square footage is just one of many factors
driving the desirability of a housing complex project. To better understand what
sort of amenities and housing accommodations would be most valued in this type
of arrangement, data from the 362-person Miami case study survey was used and
analyzed[2]. The most important features in ranked order of importance were:
•Parking
•On-site laundry
•Outdoor green space
•Security
•Pool
Although the needs of Miami residents are not identical to the needs of Boston
residents, these results nonetheless provided a valuable framework to inform subsequent
design decisions with respect to which spaces and amenities to either retain or include,
and which could be repurposed to better suit the needs of prospective residents.

3. Concept Exploration and Selec-
tion
3.1 Baseline Ship Variant Selection and Description
The initial exploration of baseline candidates for conversion began through con-
sultation with the Miami-based architecture firm CallisonRTKL which had previously
explored this topic. Their lead researcher has periodically collected data on cruise ships
that are for sale, and this data was provided to our project team[30]. A down-selection
process was then conducted to narrow the list to actual viable candidates, based on
the following criteria:
Draft and Displacement . Although the chosen port could theoretically be
dredged to accommodate larger vessels, the associated costs incurred could quickly
add to the overall project cost. The average underwater dredging costs start at $70
per cubic yard and can balloon to several hundred dollars per cubic yard based on sea
floor type, such as sensitive soil[2]. Therefore, any additional dredging was deemed
infeasible. Ships were first eliminated if their maximum drafts exceeded the 35 foot
water depth of the chosen site location at the North Jetty Pier, to include an additional
10% clearance as recommended by port engineers[2]. Although it was predicted that
the selected cruise ship would not be docked at its current reported maximum draft
given eventual weight removals, there were too many uncertainties this early in the
design process to justify a different draft approximation and so the more conservative
approach was taken.
The selected variant had to retain the ability to potentially dock at other ports
along the United States eastern seaboard in order to meet the objective “relocatable”
requirement. A broad assessment of additional Eastern seaboard cruise port locations
and their draft limits was conducted because it was initially assumed that cruise ports
would be the most fitting sites to dock the converted cruise ship. Examples include:
1.Cape Liberty Cruise Port (Bayonne, New Jersey). NOAA chart data did not
provide sufficiently detailed information regarding the water depth specifically at
the location where cruise ships dock at Cape Liberty. However, Royal Caribbean
Group (RCG) is the port’s main tenant, and in 2015 the 168,000 GT Quantum of
the Seas cruise ship was homeported there[31][32]. That vessel has a maximum
draft of 29’, and so this was treated as the upper bound for this port.
2.Baltimore Cruise Port (Baltimore, Maryland). Reported cruise ship berth water
depth of 35 feet[33].
3.Port Charleston (Charleston, South Carolina). Reported cruise ship berth water
depth of 47 feet[34].
Ultimately, the vast majority of similarly-sized cruise ports did not have limiting
water depths, and did not appreciably narrow the baseline variant tradespace. In
reality, canvassing potential site locations should not be limited to just cruise ports,
especially since many cruise ports likely face the same volume-heavy schedule at Flynn
Cruiseport and thus may not be able to support this type of long-term docking. Further
13
research could uncover additional site candidates which do not face the same traffic
volume concerns of a cruise port but may also have more restrictive draft requirements
since they are not necessarily accommodating large cruise ships and container vessels.
Housing Capacity . Although there were no strict requirements to provide a
certain number of housing units, in order to make such a conversion worth the cost,
the chosen cruise ship needed to be a relatively large ship. Based on achieving just the
bare minimum square footage requirements, and in assessing the general layout and
sizing of cruise ship cabins, it was clear that some extent of cabin merging would be
necessary to meet the design goals. Therefore, it was critical to choose a variant with
a relatively high number of cabins. Ultimately, it was determined that the candidate
cruise ship had to have at least 500 existing cabins.
Cost of Purchase . From this resulting smaller tradespace, the key determining
factors were overall cost, and cost per tonnage. Although the fixed capital costs,
including cost of purchase, are assumed to be fully government funded, it was still a
priority to minimize upfront costs where possible in order to more strongly argue for
the ultimate feasibility of this proposal.
Amongst the remaining options, the RCG Monarch of the Seas Sovereign-class
cruise ship was the most affordable choice. The listed purchase price was $35 million,
which corresponded to approximately $473/ton[30]. Further research indicated that the
Monarch had, in fact, already been sold to the Spanish cruise line Pullmantur, who
subsequently declared bankruptcy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ship was then
sold for scrap metal to the main shipbreaking facility in Aliaga, Turkey[35]. A review of
the RCG fleet was conducted to identify a comparable vessel and was cross-referenced
to commercially-available 3D cruise ship models which would be used throughout the
project for modeling, redesign, and engineering analysis. Ultimately, the Vision-class
Rhapsody of the Seas cruise ship was selected.
3.2 Concept Exploration Approach
3.2.1 Housing Unit Layout and Arrangement
Considerable time was dedicated to exploring possible housing unit layouts and
arrangement strategies, since this represents the central goal of the conversion project.
One of the principal considerations was balancing the desire to efficiently reorganize and
utilize the pre-existing living spaces while maintaining a requisite level of desirability
within each proposed unit. For example, one extreme end of this design spectrum
was the purely spartan approach, wherein all the cabins were simply designated as
apartments as-is or nearly as-is, with as little modification as possible in order to
minimize cost and maximize occupancy. However, this strategy was quickly dismissed
as non-viable given its inability to not only meet the minimum housing requirements
set forth by 105 CMR, but also to offer almost nothing in terms of in-unit desirability.
Two Exterior Cabin Merge
The first seriously considered housing schema was to combine two exterior units
to the largest extent possible, and account for some small number of more bespoke
14
units where it would not be numerically or architecturally feasible to combine two
units. Figure 8 shows a rough sketch of this schema on Deck 2. Using Deck 2 as an
example, the majority of cabins are of the“Oceanview” type, most of which are 126
ft2[36]. Therefore, the most common base housing unit would be approximately 252
ft2. In this approach, approximately 60% of the interior units would also be combined
on a two-for-one basis, with the remaining cabins designated for communal space usage.
In order to provide sufficient natural light to the interior housing units, it was proposed
to remove large portions of the ship’s central volume in order to construct a centerline
open atrium which would allow light to enter and reach the interior units, similar to
that shown in Figure 7 from the aforementioned Miami-based study[2].
Figure 6: Layout of a typical Oceanview cabin pre-conversion[1].
The technical risk and engineering complexity involved in this level of structural
redesign were enough to eliminate this approach from serious further consideration.
Moreover, the base unit square footage was deemed too small to be considered suf-
ficiently desirable based on the estimated monthly cost and in comparison to similar
land-based options.
Four Cabin Merge with Walk-Through
The next proposal was to instead merge four cabins into one. The baseline
approach was that where feasible, two exterior cabins would be merged with two interior
cabins. This would simultaneously address the major concerns engendered in the first
design iteration: (1) alleviation of the insufficient unit square footage issue by roughly
doubling the base unit size to approximately 500 ft2, and (2), elimination of the need
for significant structural renovation vis-a-vis construction of a central natural light
atrium. In the forward and aft portions of the main cabin decks, four exterior units
would instead be merged owing to the irregular arrangement of the corresponding
interior units. These interior units would instead be repurposed for communal and
general storage space.
15
Figure 7: Example of centerline atrium in Miami study[2].
Figure 8: Deck 2 layout with two cabin merge.
16
The primary concern with this layout strategy was the oddity of a single base
unit being separated by a hallway, which forces certain residents to transit through
a common space in order to access different parts of their apartment. This feature
minimized the alterations necessary to the existing units while still providing adequate
square footage, which is one of the key traits to achieving desirability. However upon
further discussion, we ultimately determined the walk-through to be an unacceptable
design decision. Despite a likely increase in refurbishment cost we continued to explore
further arrangement options.
Figure 9: Deck 2 layout with four cabin merge and walk-through.
Providing Unit Variety
In the previous design iteration, the base unit provided the desirability we aimed
to achieve, was replicated to the largest extent possible throughout the decks, and
was slated to be priced exactly at the assumed affordable median rent value of $1,269.
However, we determined that this approach ultimately lacked legitimate practicality.
In order to provide affordable housing to a wider range of people–the primary stated
goal of this proposal–we had to offer a broader range of housing options at a wider range
of price points. If we remained strictly tethered to the median affordable rent value,
we would effectively be cutting out the lower income-earning population for whom
affordable housing is even that much more of a financial strain. This also aligned with
the feedback we received from our project sponsor that we should provide more variety
in our unit offerings, such that even those earning around $20,000 a year would have
at least some options available at this housing complex.
This mixed-income approach allowed us to design smaller units, which in turn
afforded greater flexibility in the cabins we could merge and in what manner we could
merge them. On the other end of the spectrum, some rooms were already larger in
size than the “standard” 500 ft2combined units, particularly the suites (see Figure
10). Many of these rooms were turned into larger units, closer to 700 ft2to allow
for possible family accommodations or 2-bedroom equivalent units. Ultimately, this
enabled the most efficient use of the existing cabin infrastructure and resulted in our
design being able to provide a greater number of housing units with greater variety,
but all of which remained affordable.
17

Including In-Unit Kitchens
Although 88% of the Miami case study respondents indicated at least some in-
terest in the general idea of living on a converted cruise ship, only 56% of respondents
said they were willing to lose an in-unit kitchen[2]. The prospect of modifying cabins
to include in-unit kitchens was initially perceived to be non-viable given the various
marine vessel safety codes prohibiting such accommodations and discussions with mul-
tiple SMEs [30][37][38]. However, the United States Coast Guard no longer provides
Certificates of Inspection (COI) to vessels that are classified as Permanently Moored
Vehicles (PMV)[39]. The fire safety and inspection requirements also shift from mar-
itime standards to local municipal jurisdiction. Although additional research is required
to determine the process by which to classify the converted cruise ship as a PMV, the
existence of this legal framework strengthens the plausibility that in-unit kitchens can
be provided.
Moreover, at this point in the design process, the project sponsor indicated that
the complete prohibition of in-unit kitchens would be considered a “fatal flaw” . There-
fore, the majority of units would be outfitted to satisfy 105 CMR Section 410.100
minimum requirements for kitchen facilities, namely to include a sufficiently sized sink,
a stove and oven in good repair, and the space and proper facilities for the installation
of a refrigerator[29].
It is important to note that adding in-unit kitchens will add additional refurbish-
ment costs and complexity, to include[30]:
•Cost for HVAC installation
•Waste removal operational costs
•New appliance installation
•Adding clearances for cooking space
•Adding soffits to hide exhaust ducts above the stove and oven
•Adding plumbing in the interior walls of the units; current units only have plumb-
18
ing along the corridor, which is the reason why the unit bathrooms are always
along the corridor.
•Increased usage and need for fire-resistant and fire-tested materials for any unit
with a kitchen include.
3.2.2 Major Utilities
Given the present lack of SSP infrastructure at Flynn Cruiseport and the North
Jetty Pier (and the majority of the Eastern seaboard cruise ports for that matter), an
easier and cheaper alternative would be to assume the ship’s currently installed diesel
engines would remain in place and provide the primary source of power for the converted
design. However, the deleterious environmental and public health implications of this
decision are potentially severe and may prove impossible to navigate politically. We
surmise that there would be very little public appetite for the docked cruise ship to be
running its diesel engines at all times along the pier, and that it could possibly render
the entire proposal non-viable.
To better assess this environmental impact, as well as the positive impact that
conversion to shore power could bring, the EPA’s Shore Power Emissions Calculator
(SPEC) was utilized. This online tool assists port stakeholders in evaluating whether
shore power would be an appropriate means to reduce pollution, and to estimate emis-
sions reductions from installed systems[40].
SPEC accounts for power grid subregion location, vessel type, fuel type, number of
annual vessel calls, average hotel hours per vessel call, and the nominal auxiliary engine
hotelling load while in-port in order to calculate the ship’s annual energy consumption,
annual vessel power emissions, annual corresponding shore power emissions, and the
difference between the two power-providing methods.
The keel of the Rhapsody of the Seas was laid on December 11, 1995, there-
fore its four installed W¨ artsil¨ a 12V46C diesel engines are classified as “pre-2000 en-
gines” and are subject to IMO Tier 1 emission standards under the 2008 Annex VI
amendments[41][42]. Moreover, because Boston was chosen as the site location for this
study, the ship’s emissions limits also fall under the jurisdiction of the North American
ECA, which as of 2020 implemented a 0.10% SOx emission limit. Therefore, it was
assumed that if the installed engines remained in place for use, they would have to
burn Marine Gas Oil (MGO) 0.10% Sulphur Tier I fuel.
Given the year-round docking of the proposed design, the number of annual vessel
calls was maximized at 365. The average “hotel hours” allotted for the base load was
set at 16 hours for each 24-hour period, in order to cover the majority of the day
and account for variances in individuals’ schedules, while also assuming that certain
common spaces and amenities would not be available for around-the-clock service.
The nominal auxiliary engine hotelling load for a 60,000-ton cruise ship was given
as 3500 kW[40]. Considerable attention was taken to reassess an appropriate baseline
hotelling value. The primary factors driving a reduction in the base demand included:
•Significant reduction in personnel. The maximum actual occupancy of the
Rhapsody is 3,181 persons (including crew), whereas the projected onboard living
19
population for the converted design is approximately 350. This represents an
order of magnitude difference that will significantly reduce general power demand
and energy consumption.
To further specify this energy consumption contribution, relevant residential elec-
tricity data for Boston was used to predict expected usage rates for the future
converted cruise ship residents. The average electricity customer energy con-
sumption for a one or two-bedroom apartment in the city is 900 kWh per month
and 10,800 kWh per year[43]. Given the proposed 246-unit converted layout,
this results in a base annual resident energy consumption of 2,656,800 kWh , and
corresponds to an instantaneous hotelling load demand of 304 kW.
•Elimination of large refrigerated storage spaces. Food storage will shift
from the currently installed massive reefers to the in-unit refrigerator options.
•Significant reduction of industrial kitchen appliance usage. Given the
mandate to include in-unit kitchen accommodations, the large current cooking
spaces and attendant industrial-size kitchen appliances will be repurposed and
thus require significantly less power.
•Reduced cooling requirements within engineering spaces. A large portion
of the equipment and machinery will either be retired in place or operated at a
significantly lower capacity, including the main diesel engines. This removal of
large heat loads within these spaces will drastically reduce the corresponding
cooling requirements.
•Elimination of below deck berthing. The proposal to convert the majority
of the berthing and general storage spaces on Decks 0 and 1 to parking eliminates
even more spaces that would otherwise require full HVAC services.
Thus, the overall power demand is expected to be much lower than the nominal
value originally proposed by the SPEC tool. For the purposes of all follow-on calcu-
lations, the auxiliary engine hotelling load was assumed to be 2000 kW . This power
demand projects a total annual energy consumption of 11,680,000 kWh .
This annual energy consumption was correlated both with vessel fuel emission
factors and grid subregion emission factors in order to calculate the expected annual
vessel power emissions and shore power emissions. The results are described in Table
2, which illustrates the massive potential for emissions reductions by investing and
shifting to SSP technology.

Cost Estimate: Vessel Power vs. Shore Power
To estimate the cost of providing this energy with the installed diesel engines,
their specific fuel consumption (SFC) data was correlated with the previously deter-
mined expected annual energy consumption. Each of the 12V46C engines has a ca-
pacity of 12,600 kW, so it is assumed that only one diesel engine would be running
to supply the required hotelling load of 2000 kW[44]. This loading condition on the
diesel engine approximately corresponds to a SFC of 189.3 g/kwH[45]. Per unit fuel
cost was then found using up-to-date marine shipping data. New York City port fuel
prices were utilized given the proximity and cost-of-shipping similarities between the
two cities, as New York’s price data was readily available online while Boston’s was
not. The average cost of MGO Tier I fuel was $987/MT[46]. The projected annual
electricity costs using the installed vessel power were $2.2 million .
To estimate the annual consumption costs by switching to SSP, the same annual
energy consumption total was used and then multiplied by the average electric rate in
Boston as of 2022, which was 27 ¢/kWh[43]. The projected annual electricity costs by
switching to shore power were $3.2 million .
While these cost projections are not immediately favorable to the SSP proposal,
there is more flexibility and potential for cost reduction in the SSP approach. The Mass-
port Shore Power feasibility study noted that negotiation of an amenable electric rate
would likely be critical to the success of SSP implementation[9]. Moreover, Eversource
Energy, the main utility provider in Massachusetts, offers its discount rate incentive
to a wide range of individuals associated with certain social welfare benefit programs,
including those in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP/Fuel
Assistance), and those living in public or subsidized housing[47]. Therefore, it is en-
tirely plausible that a discounted rate could be agreed upon for this affordable housing
venture, especially if it has the support and backing of the local and state government,
as is the current assumption. Eversource’s discount rates can save residents anywhere
from 9-77% off their electric rate. If it is modestly assumed that the electric rate were
discounted at 25% to 20 ¢/kWh, then the projected annual electricity costs by switch-
ing to shore power fall to $2.3 million , well within a competitive range to the vessel
power costs, especially when the accrued environmental benefits are considered.
Addressing Installed Electrical Capacity
Given the many compelling reasons for shore power conversion, we assess it as
the most viable option to provide electricity for the converted cruise ship and should
be considered an essential investment to the overall conversion. As such, the vessel’s
installed electrical power must be reconsidered for repurposing, removal, or some com-
bination therein. Each main diesel engine is rated at 12,600 kW, weighs 235 tons, and
has the following principal dimensions: 15.4 mx 4.1 mx 6m[44]. Additionally, the
ship is equipped with two GMC 16V-92TA Emergency Diesel Generators, each rated
at approximately 700 kW[48][49]. The customer requirement to retain some form of
onboard electrical capacity–to mitigate primary power loss and achieve relocatibility–
meant that we could not simply remove all of the installed electrical capacity on board.
Beyond that, removing that much weight that low on the ship could have unfavorable
implications for the ship’s resulting center of gravity and overall stability. Therefore,
21
there had to be a truly compelling reason to substantiate the need for engine removal.
We had originally believed that removing most of the diesel engine footprint
would open up additional volume to include more parking in the design. However,
detailed deck plan drawings for the engineering spaces were not publicly available, so
we had to rely on very basic diagrams from a previous 2.704 conversion project, created
based on input from an RCG technical POC[50]. To supplement this relatively sparse
information, we also reviewed online videos of Rhapsody engine space walkthroughs,
which helped to illustrate the challenge of repurposing the engine room spaces without
a nearly complete gutting and overhaul[51]. The amount of equipment and piping
distributed through the spaces would result in unavoidable interference issues, such
that simply removing the diesel engines would not result in parking-suitable spaces.
Given the expectation to retain most of the auxiliary engineering systems ( i.e. air
conditioning, heating, plumbing), and the necessity to retain the diesel engine support
systems ( i.e.hydraulics, lube oil, cooling water), it was ultimately deemed infeasible
to repurpose the engineering spaces for parking.
In turn, we were unable to find a compelling enough reason to remove the non-
operational diesel engines and incur the overhaul cost and complexity associated with
that decision. At the same time, we recognized that keeping all the diesel engines in an
available status would incur unnecessary operational and maintenance costs over the
lifetime of the ship, and thus some of the engines should be ‘retired in place. Only one
installed W¨ artsil¨ a diesel engine would need to be online to provide the ship’s electrical
loading if required to divorce from shore power, or in the event of its loss. To provide an
additional level of redundancy, and also to support relocation evolutions where shore
power may be unavailable for an extended period, we decided to maintain two W¨ artsil¨ a
diesel engines in an operational status and retire in place the remaining two W¨ artsil¨ a
engines and the two GMC emergency diesel generators.
Water
TheRhapsody is capable of producing 1200 tons of freshwater per day with its in-
stalled freshwater generation systems[52]. RCG’s cruise ship fleet on average produces
90% of its freshwater onboard through two main processes: desalination/evaporation
and reverse osmosis[4]. The desalination system boils and evaporates seawater, which
is then condensed into freshwater. This process is enabled by repurposing the diesel en-
gines’ jacket water waste heat to facilitate the evaporation process. Given the proposed
shift to shore power technology and lack of propulsion demand, this source of waste
heat will be unavailable, and thus retaining the desalination units for water production
will not be possible.
The reverse osmosis (RO) units produce freshwater by pumping seawater through
coarse strainers at low pressure, and then through a series of semi-permeable mem-
branes and filters at high pressure[53]. This process yields clean permeate which is
then transferred to the ship’s water treatment systems until it meets all standards for
human consumption and can be stored in the potable water tanks. Although the RO
units are not reliant on engine waste heat, they are normally only operated outside four
nautical miles from shore, and in water at least 50 meters deep, to avoid shore-based
contamination, strainer blockage, and filter exhaustion[54][55]. Our research was un-
22
able to determine specific restrictions that RCG implements on its RO usage in port,
but it was clear that nearly all water production occurs while the ship is transiting
in open waters. Water capacity shortfalls while in-port are abetted by bunkering, the
process of taking on freshwater supply from a land-based provider.
As such, the team determined that it would be infeasible to attempt to maintain
the installed onboard freshwater production systems for the converted cruise ship. In-
stead, the ship will rely on connecting to the city’s water distribution system, managed
by Boston Water and Sewage Company (BWSC).
Wastewater
Similarly, we determined that the operational upkeep of the main wastewater
treatment systems installed onboard would have no real benefit. Once pierside, there is
no material distinction between graywater ( i.e.water from sinks, showers, laundry, air
conditioning condensate) and blackwater ( i.e.water from toilets and medical facility),
since neither of these water types can be discharged overboard when docked. Thus,
the main wastewater collected onboard will still have to be landed with some relatively
frequent periodicity, and ultimately conveyed like the “normal” city wastewater–to the
deep waters of Massachusetts Bay via the 9.5-mile long Effluent Outfall Tunnel[56]. The
“normal” city wastewater is not segregated in any meaningful way prior to its arrival
at the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant, where it then undergoes preliminary
primary and secondary treatment before discharge. Therefore, the team assessed that
the most logical and long-term cost-effective approach was to invest in the necessary
pierside and shipboard infrastructure and upgrades to permit ship wastewater discharge
directly to the city’s sewer system.
Over 88% of RCG cruise ships feature a wastewater system architecture that in-
corporates a merging of the graywater and blackwater collection trains to the Advanced
Wastewater Purification (AWP) system[4]. Under normal operations, the AWP treats
both water types to sufficiently stringent standards such that the resulting combined
effluent can be discharged beyond three nautical miles from shore. MARPOL/IMO pol-
icy allows normally treated blackwater to be discharged beyond three nautical miles,
but RCG policy extends that limit to 12 nautical miles, so the increased stringency to
which AWP adheres has clear operational benefit.
It was initially believed that the existence of the AWP presented a valuable op-
portunity to maintain this infrastructure largely in place, and retrofit just the AWP
holding tank with the necessary piping and fittings to connect to the off-hull sewer
system. This would minimize the number of structural upgrades which would be re-
quired for off-hull connections, and reduce associated refurbishment costs. However,
additional research determined that Rhapsody is one of the few RCG cruise ships out-
fitted with the Navalis Poseidon AWP system (see Figure 12) which maintains separate
graywater and blackwater trains throughout the entire treatment process until the final
ultraviolet (UV) polishing process prior to discharge[5]. Without maintaining the AWP
system fully operational, it did not seem likely that this approach could be feasibly
pursued. Instead, we propose to disassociate the graywater and blackwater trains from
the AWP system, retain each of their holding tanks (see Figure 11), and provision them
with the necessary connections to allow off-hull discharge to the pier sewage system.

4. Concept Definition and Feasibili-
ty/Performance Analyses
4.1 Design Definition
Our converted cruise ship design focuses on achieving the primary goals of afford-
ability and desirability in order to create a promising and dignified alternative housing
solution. We gained valuable insight from experts and researchers who had previously
explored this topic in order to determine what sort of housing we could feasibly provide,
what sort of amenities were necessary to include, and what major changes or upgrades
would be required to effectively create a successful housing community afloat.
Our baseline variant selection process identified the Vision-class Rhapsody of the
Seas cruise ship as a strong and viable candidate for conversion, based on its adequate
size, potential capacity for housing, estimated cost, and expectation that it would soon
be retired and decommissioned.
However, given the proprietary nature of information, there was no fully rendered
3D model of the Rhapsody publicly available for our study. Instead, the model we used
and redesigned in Rhino3D and ORCA was a merged product of a 3D “shell” of the
original Rhapsody , and a model imported from ASSET which approximated the prin-
cipal dimensions and the first six decks of a Vision-class cruise ship which was used
in a previous 2.704 conversion project[50]. This 3D model is shown in Figure 13. The
remaining decks were added to the model by assuming a constant vertical distance
between them. Curves of form and sectional areas were calculated in order to establish
a representative baseline volume and displacement. These values corresponded closely
to publicly available information regarding the Rhapsody’s actual characteristics, indi-
cating a valid pre-conversion model in which to implement our conversion changes.
The team used publicly available deck plans to develop 2D layouts with our
arrangement modifications. On the resident decks, multiple housing unit strategies
were proposed before deciding on the final design which offers a variety of unit types,
scaled by size and price, in order to provide increased housing options for a wider
range of potential residents. Simultaneously, our intention was to make best use of
the large volume of available spaces onboard to provide not only the requisite housing
we envisioned but also an impressive array of additional amenities. We emphasized
retaining existing spaces and facilities as much as possible in order to minimize overhaul
complexity and in recognition that many of the features already provided on a cruise
ship would be equally well-suited for a long-term housing community. Where this
approach was not possible, such as converting portions of the lower decks into parking
garages, a more detailed analysis was performed to determine the requirements, costs,
and safety implications of implementing such a significant change.
During this modification process, we accounted for weight additions and removals
resulting from the proposed conversions, specified by deck and weight group type, in
order to apply these changes back into our 3D model for post-conversion stability
analysis.
26
The other major concurrent effort in this design was to account for how utilities
would be addressed in order to ensure safe, sanitary, and successful day-to-day opera-
tions on a long-term basis, which represents a significant departure from a cruise ship’s
normal operations in-port. Detailed research was conducted in order to effectively ar-
gue that significant but essential investments in pierside and shipboard infrastructure
and equipment upgrades should be coupled to this conversion proposal in order to en-
able shore power operations and permanent interoperability with the host city’s water
and sewage distribution systems.
Figure 13: Rendering of 3D Model.
4.1.1 Ship Geometry
In accordance with the design philosophy, we tried to maintain as much of the
original ship structure as possible. No changes were made to the external geometry
of the ship other than minor modifications in the aft superstructure to allow for more
natural light.
4.1.2 Arrangement Modifications
The crux of this project was modifying the arrangements of the cruise ship to
create a desirable housing environment. We used the publicly available deck plans of the
Rhapsody for Decks 2-12[36]. Decks 0 and 1 are proprietary information and therefore
were inaccessible, but we used renderings created by a previous 2.704 project (obtained
through discussion with a RCG point of contact) as a best estimate of these deck
plans[50]. The engine room, located below the “Tween” deck, was also not available
and is not shown. We did not make any changes to the layout of the engine room.
Deck 0 and “Tween” Deck
Figures 14-17 show the reference and modified layouts of Decks 0 and the “Tween”
Deck. The “Tween” Deck is a shortened deck above the engine room and below Deck 0.

28
As mentioned previously these deck layouts were not publicly available, and we could
not find any information on the layout inside the engineering spaces. For these reasons
we chose to leave these engineering areas unchanged and converted the crew berthing
areas into a parking lot.
Deck 1
Figure 18: Deck 1 Layout Before Modification
Figure 19: Deck 1 Layout After Modification
Figures 18 and 19 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 1. This deck
layout was not publicly available, so the spaces and locations are approximate. We did
not alter the steering gear and anchor or the crane, but we converted the refrigerated
storage and the forward most crew berthing into general storage. We also maintained
all of the pier access points and converted the areas between the two most forward pier
access points into parking.
Deck 2
Figure 20: Deck 2 Layout Before Modification
29
Figure 21: Deck 2 Layout After Modification
Figures 20 and 21 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 2. This is the
first deck with passenger staterooms which were the largest focus of our arrangement
modifications. All of the exterior staterooms and some of the interior staterooms were
used to create larger ”apartments,” separated into small, medium, and large rooms.
The remaining interior cabins were converted into either a shared laundry space or
storage units.
Deck 3
Figure 22: Deck 3 Layout Before Modification
Figure 23: Deck 3 Layout After Modification
Figures 22 and 23 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 3. As on Deck
2, all of the exterior staterooms and some of the interior staterooms were used to create
30
apartments. The forward interior cabins were converted into a communal kitchen space
to be used by the residents of the small units on Decks 2-4. The remaining interior
cabins were converted into either a shared laundry space or storage units.
Deck 4
Figure 24: Deck 4 Layout Before Modification
Figure 25: Deck 4 Layout After Modification
Figures 24 and 25 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 4. Again
all of the exterior staterooms and some of the interior staterooms were used to create
apartments while the remaining interior cabins were converted into either a shared
laundry space or storage units. This is the first deck with areas we were able to
convert to more desirable amenities. The largest of these was the Edelweiss Dining
Room which we converted into a gym complete with locker rooms and a yoga studio
(previously the Chef’s Table restaurant). The gym will be open to the public. We
maintained the main entrance for use as the public entrance, added a mail room and
leasing office, and repurposed the bar as the front desk.
Deck 5
Figures 26 and 27 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 5. This deck
contains only amenities and no living spaces. As on Deck 4, the second level of the
Edelweiss Dining Room was converted became the second level of the gym. The casino,
guest services, and shore excursions areas were combined into a communal gathering
space complete with tables, chairs, and televisions. The Broadway Melodies Theatre
31
Figure 26: Deck 5 Layout Before Modification

was maintained and can be utilized as a movie theater or meeting space with a capacity
large enough to fit all residents.
Deck 6
Figure 28: Deck 6 Layout Before Modification
Figures 28 and 29 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 6. As on
Deck 5, this deck contains only amenities and no living spaces. The second level of the
Broadway Melodies Theatre was maintained as described on Deck 5. All of the shops
and areas just forward of the Centrum Balcony were cleared out and replaced with
one coffee shop and a business center containing computers and printers for resident
use. The three restaurants and bars were converted into a grocery store. The Shall We
Dance Lounge and Diamond Club will be repurposed into a daycare facility that will
be open to the public.

Figures 32 and 33 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 8. All of
the exterior staterooms were used to create apartments. The forward interior cabins
were converted into a communal kitchen space to be used by the residents of the small
units. The remaining interior cabins were converted into either a shared laundry space
or storage units.
Housing Unit Summary
In total, there are 246 housing units that have been created from the original
cabin arrangement, which we predict will be able to accommodate approximately 350
people. The units break down into the following notional major categories:
“Small/Studio” (42) – Unit sizes range from 252-438 ft2. Rent prices range from
$475-1000 per month. No in-unit kitchens; cooking/food storage needs are accommo-
dated by communal kitchen spaces.
“Medium/One Bedroom” (160) – Unit sizes range from 482-590 ft2. Rent prices
range from $1269-1500 per month. In-unit kitchens provided.
34
“Large/One+ Bedroom” (44) – Unit sizes range from 629-1326 ft2. Rent prices
range from $1550-3000 per month. In-unit kitchens provided.
A complete breakdown of the rooms is shown in Figure 61 in Appendix H.
Deck 9
Figure 34: Deck 9 Layout Before Modification
Figure 35: Deck 9 Layout After Modification
Figures 34 and 35 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 9. The Wind-
jammer Cafe was converted into a library. The main pool and surrounding area were
removed and replaced with a large park. The indoor pool was maintained as is, other
than removing the Park Cafe. The Vitality At Sea Spa and Fitness Center and as much
of the surrounding area as possible were converted into a green space for the residents.
Deck 10
Figures 36 and 37 show the reference and modified layouts of Deck 10. The kid
friendly amenities towards the front were converted into another green space. The
running track and Crystal Canopy were maintained. The upper level of the Vitality
At Sea Spa and Fitness Center was also converted into a green space, while the rock
climbing wall was removed.
Decks 11 and 12
Figures 38-41 show the reference and modified layouts of Decks 11 and 12. These
decks consist of relatively small usable areas in the superstructure. On both decks we
converted the existing amenities into additional green space.

4.1.3 Hull Subdivision
The Rhapsody’s registry page reports that the ship has 20 transverse bulkheads
[48]. The actual longitudinal positions of the watertight bulkheads were not publicly
available, so we assumed they were evenly spaced along the length of the ship. We also
assumed that the collision bulkheads were located at 5% of the total ship length aft of
the forward perpendicular (FP) and forward of the aft perpendicular (AP). Floodable
length analysis was first conducted with the pre-conversion bulkhead locations, with the
resulting floodable length curve provided in Appendix B. This analysis demonstrated
that the Rhapsody hull satisfies the SOLAS 90 two-compartment floodable length stan-
dard. Because this ship is not a U.S. Naval vessel, no additional requirements were
assessed.
The addition of parking spaces in the lower decks would require the removal of
certain transverse bulkheads. The allotted parking spaces span from approximately
75 meters to 140 meters aft of the FP. We conservatively estimated that this corre-
lated to five transverse bulkheads (bulkheads 7 through 11). These bulkheads were
removed and the floodable length analysis was re-performed. Despite this substantial
widening of hull subdivisions, the floodable length criteria are still met, as seen in the
post-conversion floodable length curve provided in Appendix B. The two-compartment
standard remains satisfied.
Beyond these damaged stability considerations, more rigorous structural analysis
is required to determine the bulkheads’ removal on the ship’s overall strength charac-
teristics and performance.
4.1.4 Structural Arrangement/Design
Decks 0, 1, and the “Tween” deck were significantly altered to accommodate space
for parking. As such, a minimum of three factors must be evaluated to determine the
feasibility of such a conversion: the effect on the vessel’s floodable length, the effect on
structural integrity, and the amount of parking spaces that can be afforded. Because
the decks that were converted to parking reside below the margin line, they must be
evaluated to ensure that floodable length requirements are met since the intention is
for the vessel to reside in the water. This evaluation can be found in Section 4.1.3
and in Appendix B. The deck stresses must be analyzed to ensure that the spaces can
indeed function as a garage. Finally, the number of spaces created must be sufficient
for the number of residents for the effort to be worth the cost.
The lack of fidelity in our 3D model–with respect to the material type and the
bulkhead/beam/strake layout in these spaces–did not lend itself to a meaningful fi-
nite element analysis (FEA) performance. Therefore, to determine if the structure of
the cruise ship is capable of performing as a partial garage, it is better to compare
the requirements of a structure designed for parking versus one designed for people.
The International Building Code (IBC) requires land-based parking structures to be
designed for a live load of 40lbs
in2(1.69kg
m2) [57]. Comparatively, the IBC requires areas
designed for public assembly to withstand a live load of 100lbs
in2(4.24kg
m2). Since the
ship was designed to accommodate thousands of passengers, it is assumed that the
decks were built with similar pressure requirements. Therefore, using the aforemen-
38
Table 3: Parking Spaces by Deck.
Deck Area ( m2)Spaces Available
1 2400 72
0 2400 72
Tween 1700 50
Total 194
tioned live load numbers required by the IBC as a guide, it is assumed that the decks,
which included berthing spaces for crew members, are sufficient to withstand the loads
of vehicles. More detailed structural analysis, along with the requisite construction
information, is necessary if this concept goes to further feasibility level design.
Given the beam of the vessel is 32 meters it was determined that the ship is wide
enough to incorporate ninety-degree parking. Since this is the most efficient layout it
would allow for the maximum number of spaces[57]. Using the square footage from the
3D model at each of the applicable decks, between the above-mentioned frames, gave
a baseline area to reserve for parking. Taking this area and dividing by an efficiency
rating of 32.5 m2[57], to account for lane widths for vehicular travel and parking space
width, gives the total number of viable parking spaces per deck. Table 3 shows the
number of spaces per deck and the total number of spaces.
Considering that there are 246 units, 194 parking spaces means that 78% of
units could have a designated parking space. However only 66% of Boston residents
have a car, so it is reasonable that these 194 spaces would cover all the residents with
vehicles[58]. Given that more space is available to dedicate to parking, it is possible to
expand the parking capacity to accommodate additional guest parking, staff parking,
and even potentially public parking. Sufficient structural analysis and any required
waivers or alternatives to ensure continued satisfaction of floodable length requirements
would be necessary. Therefore, it was determined that converting portions of the three
lower decks into a parking facility is feasible and provides a highly desirable amenity
in a densely populated area.
4.1.5 Power and Propulsion Plant
The converted Rhapsody uses shore power as the primary source of electrical
power. Two W¨ artsil¨ a 12V46C marine diesel engines are maintained in an operational
status as a backup source of power in the event of a loss of shore power or when
the vessel cannot connect to shore power ( i.e.being towed, inclement weather, etc.).
Although consideration was given to removing the propulsion shafts, no clear benefit
could be identified to warrant the engineering complexity, technical risk, and added
costs to the conversion project. For these reasons the shafts will remain in place but
all support systems will be retired in place to alleviate the maintenance burden and
lifecycle costs. As such the converted ship maintains no propulsion capability.

4.1.6 Weight Estimation
In order to assess the converted cruise ship’s approximate weight, our major steps
were as follows: estimate the weight of the pre-converted cruise ship; categorize the
weights and allocate them to each deck; evaluate the expected change in weight due to
additions and removals on each deck in the converted design.
Once an estimate of the ship’s displacement was determined, ORCA software was
used to get a cross-curve stability analysis. The results yielded a block coefficient of
0.64, which falls within the range of expected values for a ship of this size (see Table
4). Additionally, a positive value was obtained for metacentric height (GM), proving
that the modeled hull was stable. The value of GM found during this initial stability
analysis was high, but this was to be expected since the model was analyzed in an light
load state while the displacement given was for a ship at full load condition. To get the
full load displacement baseline from which to conduct conversion, we had to allocate
appropriate weight estimations throughout the ship.
In order to get an estimation of weights, Ship Work Breakdown Structure (SWBS)
groups were taken from a similar-sized Landing Platform Dock (LPD) class naval vessel.
Factors of applicability were applied to each weight group. The new weights were
summed and normalized to provide a representative ratio weight group to total weight.
These normalized ratios were applied to the calculated displacement of the ship to
obtain estimated weight groups for the cruise ship as seen in Table 5. Using open
source layouts of the ship, and leveraging previous knowledge of ship arrangements,
area data for each deck was then extracted from the Rhino model and the weights of
each SWBS group were divided and spread across each applicable deck of the ship.
With the weight of each group spread longitudinally and vertically across the ship,
another stability and hydrostatics analysis was performed. As seen in Figure 55 of
Appendix E, a more realistic GM of 0.878 was found with a loaded ship with all other
data remaining close to its initial value. This proved that the baseline model, much
like the actual ship, was stable. Therefore, conversion could now be reflected and
accurately analyzed using the model.
40
Post-Conversion Weight Assignments
Given our pre-conversion estimates for SWBS group weight allocations for each
deck, we employed a process for post-conversion weight estimation using this same
framework. We reassigned SWBS weight group allocations based on the scope and
nature of the modifications proposed on each deck.
For example, the main structural weight ( i.e.SWBS Group 100) changes on the
residents decks are due to the rearrangement of the living spaces to provide larger and
more desirable housing, which required the knockdown of steel walls dividing adjacent
cabins. To better evaluate this portion of the redesign, we generated 3D representations
of the original cabin layout on Deck 2 and its converted housing layout based on their
corresponding 2D deck plans provided in Section 4.1.2. These 3D renderings for Deck
2 pre-conversion and post-conversion are shown in Figures 42 & 43, respectively. The
same steel material was assumed for both models. The resulting difference was 27.7
metric tons , and this was taken as the structural weight removal value for Deck 2.
Owing to the relative similarity between Deck 2 and the other resident deck layouts (for
both pre and post-conversion), this same value was assumed for the structural weight
removal of all the resident decks. The only slight exception was Deck 4, where the
cabins and housing account for approximately half of the deck space, so appropriate
factors were applied to reflect this specific arrangement.
Other proposed structural modifications were not as detailed, and therefore were
not modeled and reanalyzed. Instead, the team assessed the 2D post-conversion ren-
derings to estimate an appropriate factor for the amount of structural weight being
added to or removed from each deck.
We followed a similar process across all decks and SWBS groups. For example,
on Deck 0, we proposed converting the crew berthing area into a parking garage, and
therefore would have to remove significant amounts of SWBS Group 600-associated
weight ( i.e.bedding, lockers, common area furniture, etc.). Therefore, we estimated
a 70% SWBS Group 600 weight reduction for Deck 0. A similar methodology was
employed on the other decks where parking was proposed.
To address the resident decks, we envisioned that much of the furniture in each
existing cabin would be removed in order to create more open space in the housing
units. For example, while every cabin currently includes at least two twin beds, the
resulting base unit which merges four current cabins will not need eight twin beds.
The same logic can be applied to the other furnishings within each cabin, such that we
predict a considerable non-structural weight reduction from this perspective. However,
this will be counter-acted by the installation of kitchen appliances in the majority
of the new units. More detailed analysis is warranted to better ascertain the net
effect of these competing changes, but the team determined that it will likely result
in relatively minimal Group 600 weight changes across the resident decks. In order
to apply conservatism to the design, we assumed that there would be a 10% Group
600 weight reduction in all resident decks below the initial vertical center of gravity
(KG), and a 10% weight increase in all resident decks above KG. Deck 4 again proved
to be a slight exception to this heuristic, as we also had to account for the inclusion of
the main gym space in the aft portion of this deck, which drove up the SWBS Group
600 weight estimate. Overall, by effectively removing weight low and adding weight

high, we aimed to demonstrate that the converted design would still satisfy all intact
stability requirements.
All remaining decks were handled on a more specific case-by-case basis by eval-
uating the major amenity changes and determining an appropriate weight addition or
reduction factor for each SWBS group. One major driver of weight reduction higher in
the ship was the anticipated removal of SWBS Group 400-related command and con-
trol surveillance equipment. Nearly the entire navigational radar and communications
suite can be removed since the converted ship will only be operated as a towed vessel.
The pre-conversion and post-conversion total weight estimates are provided in
Table 5. We estimate an overall net weight reduction of 4300 MT , which represents
a10% reduction from the pre-conversion total weight estimate.
After determining the post-conversion weights, the Rhino model was adjusted to
reflect these changes, and stability and hydrostatics analysis was conducted in ORCA
once again. The results of this analysis can be seen in Figures 57 & 58 in Appendix E.
The calculated post-conversion GM was found to be 1.34 m, higher than that of the
pre-conversion model, meaning the ship became more stable through the conversion
process.
4.1.7 Synthesis and Convergence
Because we did not have an accurate ASSET model for this project, we had to
determine if our modified cruise ship met the MIT 2N Convergence Criteria through
different methods. We used a breakdown of “essential” and “desired” convergence
criteria requirements as shown in Tables 6 & 7, respectively.

due to the large amount of enclosed volume the Rhapsody

area of 69,107 ft2from ORCA, was calculated to be 164.5
LT/in. This estimate was based on Equation (3-15) of
Introduction to Naval Architecture [13]. The Rhapsody
features approximately 44 ft of freeboard, indicating that
the ship has approximately 88,600 LT of reserve
buoyancy[50]. The Rhapsody has a deadweight tonnage of
8000 LT according to the DNV GL vessel register.

spaced between the collision bulkheads. To accommodate
the parking garage on the lower decks, five bulkheads were
removed as detailed in Section 4.1.3. This evaluation
proved the post-conversion design met the SOLAS 90

appropriate design lanes[13][59].
Is there
appropriate
freeboard?ConfirmedCurrently the Rhapsody has 44 ft of freeboard which
was deemed more than sufficient. Furthermore, the
conversion resulted in a net reduction in displacement
which caused an increase in freeboard.
Is there
appropriate
trim/heel?AssumedAssumed satisfactory as the Rhapsody likely has no
static trim or heel; however, the weight changes due to
the conversion process would likely cause changes to
static trim/heel. Therefore, post-conversion analysis
would need to be conducted.
Is damaged
stability
satisfactory?AssumedAssumed satisfactory based on the initial construction,
further analysis will be required to account for
structural changes on Decks Tween, 0, and 1.
Is damaged
strength
satisfactory?AssumedAssumed satisfactory, based on the initial construction
and its compliance with SOLAS 90. Further analysis of
damage strength is warranted for future work.

matter experts[30]. Our purchase cost estimate was based on the $35 million listed
sale price of the Monarch of the Seas , which was the vessel initially targeted for selection
but ultimately not chosen since it had already been sold. The Monarch shares many of
the same general features as the Rhapsody but is approximately 20,000 tons smaller[60].
Therefore, a scaling factor was applied to arrive at a purchase cost estimate of $45
million .
In order to estimate the refurbishment costs, we retrieved historical cost data
spanning from 2005 to 2021 of cruise ship refurbishments, refits, and overhauls[61].
Refurbishment cost was analyzed as a function of tonnage to get a better sense of how
cost scaled with ship size, as shown in Figure 44. Additionally, details of these previous
refurbishments were surveyed for similarities between the work accomplished on those
ships, and the conversions proposed in this design. For example, the Rhapsody itself un-
derwent a $54 million refit in 2012 which involved adding new cabins, an outdoor movie
screen, new restaurants, and a nursery[5]. In addition to these general refurbishment
costs, we also had to specifically account for costs associated with retrofitting the ship
to support shore power operations. All previous shore power retrofit projects reported
an approximate $1 million cost to upgrade, and so this was the value assumed for our
conversion[9]. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics Inflation Calculator was
used to reflect end-of-2022 inflation-adjusted prices. As such, the refurbishment costs
were estimated at $50 million .
A second method to determine an estimate for the refurbishment cost was done
by calculating the individual costs of major portions of the refurbishment. In order
to achieve the desired room layouts as shown in Figures 21, 23, 25, 31, & 33, major
renovations to the staterooms were needed. These renovations can be split into two
major categories: adding kitchens to each of the medium and large units, and combining
the pre-existing cabins into the designated apartments. To estimate the cost of adding
a kitchen, we used an average cost of $24,000 for a minor remodel which includes “the
addition of entry-level cabinets, appliances updated to new, energy-efficient models,
new countertops, kitchen sink and faucet, new flooring, and freshly painted walls[62]. ”
Applying this cost estimate to each of the 204 medium and large units designed with
kitchens results in a $4.9 million overall cost estimate for adding kitchens.
To remodel the rooms, we used an estimate of $10 per square foot for paint and
flooring resulting in a cost of $1.3 million[63]. The biggest difference between these
estimates and the actual work on the ship is the labor cost. The 1-3-8 thumbrule
represents “the relative costs of work performed in shops, assembly areas, and aboard
ship after launch, respectively[64]. ” Assuming the labor cost is 40% of the cost of these
estimates, we applied this rule and multiplied the labor cost portion of the estimates
by 8 to get a final estimate of $25 million[65].
We used a similar method to determine the cost of constructing the parking lot
on the lower decks. Starting with an estimate of $6 per square foot followed by the
application of the 1-3-8 rule to the entire cost instead of just labor gave an estimate
of$5.2 million[66]. For the other large amenity renovations we assumed $1 million for
the gym, $250,000 for the grocery store, and $100,000 for the daycare[67][68][69]. Once
again applying the 1-3-8 rule to the assumed 40% labor cost resulted in an estimated
$5.4 million cost for these three conversion projects.
46
Because we are not maintaining propulsion capability onboard the ship, we con-
sidered removing the propeller and the shaft as they are no longer necessary. Following
a discussion with the Engineering Manager of Submarine Propulsion Shafting Systems
at Naval Surface Warfare Center Philadelphia Division (NSWCPD), we came to the
conclusion that the cost of removal would be substantial and far outweigh any potential
benefits of doing so.
Finally, as a conservative estimate of the cost of construction to demolish and
rebuild walls, minor amenity renovations, and in general higher construction costs
aboard a ship in dry dock compared to shore construction, we added a factor of 50%
on top of all the estimates. This gave us a final total refurbishment cost of $53.3
million , a data point that supports the estimate determined from historic cruise ship
repair data.
Figure 44: Tonnage vs. Refurbishment Cost (2005-2021)
Pierside Infrastructure Upgrades
In addition to the shipside refurbishments and upgrades, this conversion will
also require considerable pierside upgrades to infrastructure and utility systems to
support essential services onboard. The most significant of these upgrades will be the
installation of shore power technology at the North Jetty Pier. In consideration of the
previous East Coast shore power projects recently completed, about which information
can be found in Appendix A, and adjusting properly for inflation, we estimate the
pierside shore power costs to be $18.5 million . This includes the installation of plug-
in ports directly at the pier, acquisition costs of all necessary power cabling, and the
establishment of ancillary facilities and equipment to support successful shore power
operations.
47
Based on the expected average and peak electrical loading previously estimated
for the converted cruise ship, it was assessed that the actual city electric grid would
have sufficient capacity to take on this new power demand without requiring additional
infrastructure upgrades. This eliminated the need for the construction of a new 40 MW
substation which would have added an additional $15-$20 million in upgrade costs.
The other major systems requiring pier upgrades are potable water, sewage, and
waste management. The currently installed water distribution systems at Flynn Cruise-
port and the North Jetty Pier are only used for washing and cleaning and do not provide
water suitable for human consumption. Therefore, the ship will rely on connecting to
the city’s water distribution system, managed BWSC, as described and justified in
Chapter 3. To provide a long-term solution for sewage and wastewater disposal, per-
manent underground piping installation and integration with the city’s sewage system
would be required. The Miami case study determined that these upgrades at Port
Miami would cost between $2-$4 million[2]. Conservatively assuming this estimate’s
upper bound and properly accounting for inflation, the cost of these infrastructure
improvements are estimated to cost $4.8 million .
4.2.2 Operations and Support Cost
Utilities
Based on the previous power demand estimates detailed in Chapter 3, the use of
shore power technology, and assuming the discounted electric rate of 20 ¢/kWh, the
annual total electricity cost is estimated to be $2.3 million .
In order to estimate the total annual costs associated with water and sewage
services, we first analyzed the resident-specific usage rate and costs. We referenced the
most current Boston resident water usage data city’s water and sewer revenue rates,
current as of January 1, 2023. The average Boston consumer uses 41 gallons of water
per day (GPD), so this was assumed for the resident usage rate[70]. This per-day
usage falls within the lowest-tier revenue rates of $8.222/1000 gallons for water and
$10.996/1000 gallons for sewage[71]. In total, this results in an annual per capita cost
of$287.58. Our current proposal assumes a 350-resident capacity, therefore the total
annual resident water and sewer costs are estimated to be $100,659 .
Next, we considered the fitness center as the other principal driver of water and
sewer usage to better estimate the overall utility cost. We referenced a case study
that discussed the water-saving efforts of the Longfellow Clubs, a consortium of seven
Boston-based fitness clubs, implemented from 2006-2013[72]. The report cited that
they were able to reduce their average water consumption to 165,600 gallons per month.
In recognition that not all of their measures could be replicated on the converted cruise
ship, we conservatively estimated that the onboard fitness center’s water consumption
rate would be 200,000 gallons per month. Using the same revenue rate figures, this
corresponds to an annual water and sewer cost of $64,259 .
Finally, we estimated that the remaining amenities and facilities that were yet
unaccounted for would contribute roughly 20% to the overall water usage. As such,
the total annual water and sewage costs were estimated to be $205,000 .
48
Staffing/Payroll
To determine our full-time staffing requirements, and associated annual salary
costs, we first considered the typical staffing needs of a land-based apartment complex
to determine an appropriate benchmark. We recognized that our staffing needs would
be greater than this base estimate due to the number and size of the amenities offered
onboard, and the retention of larger engineering equipment and distribution systems.
Per the National Apartment Association’s Best Practices briefing from June 2020, we
found that the general rule has been to employ one full-time office staff and one full-
time maintenance staff for every 100 units[73]. In recent years, that rule has evolved
such that for properties with 200 to 299 units, there are on average 44.6 units per full-
time employee. Applying this metric to our 246-unit arrangement yields a minimum
requirement of six full-time employees. For a more typical apartment complex, this
would likely result in hiring two full-time employees each for service staff (front desk-
type workers), unit maintenance technicians, and cleaning personnel. However, in
consideration of the number of general-use amenities and spaces requiring upkeep, we
propose staffing five full-time cleaning employees. Thus, we account for nine full-time
employees strictly to handle the apartment-specific workload comparable to a land-
based residential complex.
We believed it was important to specifically address the staffing needs of two of
our larger amenities: the fitness center and daycare center. We found that for centers
of comparable size, each of these facilities would require five full-time employees, thus
adding 10 employees total to our payroll.
Finally, we assessed what sort of engineering department would need to be stood
up to maintain and operate the larger equipment and systems which would remain
onboard to enable day-to-day operations. Exact data on normal engineering crew sizes
for RCG ships was unavailable, but the Anthem of the Seas , which is a Quantum -class
vessel, reportedly has an engineering department of approximately 100 personnel[74].
TheAnthem has a gross tonnage (GT) of approximately 168,000 GT, which is over twice
the size of the Rhapsody , and has twice the installed electrical capacity[75]. Therefore,
we applied a scaling factor of 0.5 to estimate that the nominal engineering crew size
for the pre-converted Rhapsody to be 50 personnel.
We then conducted a broad assessment to determine what additional manning
reductions we could claim given the equipment and systems which will no longer be
operated, the equipment and systems which will be operated far less frequently com-
pared to the ship’s original operational profile, and the equipment and systems which
will operate with relatively similar frequency as before. For example, the entire propul-
sion suite will be retired in place, half of the main electrical generation suite will be
retired in place, and the remaining half will only be used in an emergency scenario
or in rare cases when the ship is being relocated. All of these operational condition
changes enable significant manning reductions. Conversely, the electrical distribution
system will remain fully operational, requiring the maintenance, monitoring, and safe
operation of its 6,600 kV main bus bar, and 440V/220V smaller buses. Similarly, al-
though potable water will be provided from BWSC via the pierside connection, its
distribution throughout the ship will still require the reliable operation of portions of
the as-installed water distribution system. Taking all these factors into account, we
49
justified the establishment of a 10-person engineering full-time staff.
We determined average salaries for these employee types in Boston to calculate
an approximate total annual payroll of $1.1 million [76][77][78][79][80].
Pier Lease
The North Jetty Pier in Boston is the proposed docking location for the modified
cruise ship. This pier and over 10 acres of the surrounding land (Parcels 7 & 8 shown in
Figure 45) are currently being leased to a company called Eastern Salt[81]. Under this
lease Eastern Salt will upgrade the site for several million dollars and will pay $202,000
a year in rent[6]. We used the same assumptions for rent costs because as mentioned
previously if the ship were to be docked there, millions would also be invested into
infrastructure upgrades. Therefore the assumed annual cost of leasing the North Jetty
Pier is $202,000 .
Figure 45: Map of the Eastern Salt leased facilities[6].
4.2.3 Cost Summary
Given the novelty of the proposed design, it was unclear how to ascertain which
total life cycle costs (TLC) would reasonably apply to the converted cruise ship, and
to what extent. Many of the capital and variable costs associated with TLC no longer
apply to the converted cruise ship given it will largely function more as an affordable
housing complex than an actual seagoing vessel moving forward. It has no meaningful
operational profile. Some sort of maintenance period cadence will need to be established
but should be significantly less burdensome than an actual cruise ship’s upkeep schedule
50
Table 8: Cost Summary
Fixed Costs ( $M) Operational Costs ( $M)
Purchase: 45.0 Utilities: 2.6
Refurbishment: 53.3 Staffing: 1.1
Infrastructure: 23.3 Lease: 0.2
Total: 121.6 3.9
given its near-permanent pierside status. One estimate was calculated using the MIT
2N Cost Model and is shown in Appendix G.
All of the above mentioned costs are summarized in Table 8 with a total fixed
cost of $121.6 million and an annual operational cost of $3.9 million. Given the unit
allocation and cost breakdown shown in Figure 61 in Appendix H, and assuming 100%
occupancy, we estimate that the annual rent revenue is $3.8 million . While there may
be additional revenue from opening up some of the amenities to the public, specifically
the gym and daycare facilities, we did not account for this as a guaranteed source in
our cost estimates.
4.3 Feasibility and Performance Analysis
Converting a cruise ship into affordable housing can certainly be done, but the
driving question is how much it will cost. The feasibility of this project relies heavily on
this cost discussion. As stated in Section 1.4, we assumed that the fixed costs will be
covered through various state or federal grants and subsidies, as is often the case with
affordable housing as it currently exists[82]. Therefore the remaining costs that are not
assumed to be covered are the operational and support costs. Based on the estimates
in the previous section, we calculated the operational costs to be $3.9 million and the
annual revenue from rent to be $3.8 million. This results in a deficit of approximately
$100,000, a relatively small difference when considering the overall cost estimates of
the conversion. It is reasonable to assume that this deficit could be covered by one
or more of several different methods ( i.e.additional government funding, discounted
utility or lease rates, etc.). Based on the cost estimates we determined, converting a
cruise ship into affordable housing is feasible.
It is difficult to define a metric for the performance of this converted cruise ship.
The only “mission” it has is to serve as affordable and desirable housing. Having
met the requirements listed in Section 1.3, the only other distinct performance criteria
to evaluate was post-conversion stability. Certainly, if the converted cruise ship were
unstable, it would not perform well as a housing complex. The post-conversion stability
of the ship was discussed in detail in Section 4.1.6, and with a positive GM of 1.34 m,
the ship is stable.
4.3.1 Comparative Cost Analysis
Affordable housing already exists in apartments and housing complexes ashore.
The driving factor for this project was to determine if it could be done feasibly on a
cruise ship. For this to be a reasonable alternative we must compare the cost of the
51
conversion to the cost to build an equivalent apartment complex. Cruise ships are
uniquely suited for conversion into housing because of the number of accommodations
already in place. It is clear that no other type of ship would prove as effective a housing
platform for the cost, so we did not consider any other ship-based platforms.
One way we estimated the cost to build an apartment complex was by using
a construction cost per square foot of area. Using the national average cost of $398
per square foot and the combined square footage of only the living units (none of the
amenities or common spaces), the cost to build an equivalent-sized apartment complex
from scratch on land would be approximately $52 million[83]. The living units make
up less than 50 percent of the usable floor space on the cruise ship, so to build an
apartment complex with the same amenities, common spaces, and parking would easily
exceed $100 million. However in Boston, the construction cost for a mid-rise apartment
building ranges from $392 to $510 per square foot, so realistically the cost to build this
complex in Boston could be significantly higher[84].
One of the biggest drivers in construction cost estimates comes from the cost
of land at the locations where these apartments would be built. To build a complex
with 246 units near Seaport or Downtown Boston, the building would almost certainly
need to be a high-rise which increases the cost of construction. One source estimates
anywhere from $23.8 to $240.8 million to build a 100 unit apartment building, but
notes that“if the high-rise building is located in an urban area, expect costs to be much
higher[85]. ” Assuming $100 million would be enough to build a 100 unit building, but
needing another 146 rooms and the amenities to go with it, it would be safe to assume
such a building could cost in excess of $200 million, significantly more than the cost
estimate we found for the cruise ship conversion.
Another comparison can be made by looking at two similar construction projects
in the Seaport neighborhood of Boston. Gables Seaport is a 307 unit luxury apartment
building completed in 2020 and located less than a mile from the dock. The apartments
vary from 469 square foot studio units to 1289 square foot two bedroom units[86]. The
estimated construction of this project was $157 million, again much higher than the
fixed costs we found for our conversion[87]. While not a residential building, another
large scale construction project in Seaport was the office building 121 Seaport, also lo-
cated less than a mile from the dock. This 458,000 square foot building was completed
in 2018 at a cost of $170 million[88][89]. However the executive vice president and gen-
eral manager at Skanska USA Building in Boston predicts that if this building were
to be constructed today it would cost $276 million, driven by increased material costs,
shortages in labor, and a potential zoning policy change requiring stricter environmen-
tal standards[89]. It is clear that construction costs for apartments can far exceed
our conservative cost estimates including purchase, refurbishment, and infrastructure
upgrade costs to convert a cruise ship into affordable housing.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations
5.1 Summary of Final Concept Design
This study evaluated the feasibility of converting a cruise ship into an affordable
housing community. This idea is motivated by a confluence of factors: the affordable
housing crisis besetting many cities and regions across the United States, the windfall
of cruise ships available for purchase at reasonable prices in a post-pandemic world,
and the apparent suitability of cruise ships to be repurposed for housing. In many
ways, this project aimed to address whether that last assumption was actually valid,
and whether this sort of proposal could prove feasible and cost-competitive against a
traditional, land-based housing approach.
Despite the relative novelty of this concept, it is not without precedence, and
thus our team was able to reach out to various SMEs who had explored this idea to
some extent in order to better develop and refine our design parameters and associated
requirements. Throughout the entire design process, the two main design parameters
were affordability and desirability, as we strove to maintain the proper balance between
these two central, and at times competing, qualities. They drove the design process as
we attempted to not just convert cabins into housing units, but to actually create a
space where people would want to live, and could afford to do so.
In order to assess this idea’s feasibility, we selected a baseline cruise ship variant
based on vessel size, potential housing capacity, price, and availability of a represen-
tative model to perform additional analysis. Our 3D model was used primarily for
weight estimations, intact stability analysis, and baseline remodeling to render a fi-
nal proposed ship design. In order to properly account for conversion-related weight
changes, a pre-conversion weight estimate was calculated using the SWBS group weight
allocations for a similar-sized LPD warship, and modified with applicability factors to
better reflect the cruise ship weight breakdown. Publicly available 2D deck plans were
used as the basis for arrangement modifications. Each deck was evaluated individually
and redesigned to provide some aspect of the envisioned affordable housing community.
The five current cabin decks were repurposed for the actual housing units. The
most common unit merges four current small-sized cabins in order to provide a de-
sirable unit size and permit the installation of an in-unit kitchen. This “base unit”
is priced such that the median Boston income earner could reasonably afford it, i.e.
spend no more than 30% of their gross income on rent, including utilities. The base
unit served as a reference point from which smaller and larger units were then designed,
with corresponding scaling rents, such that a spectrum of affordable housing units was
established to cover a wider range of income earners, not just the median representa-
tive. In total, our design proposes 246 housing units that are able to accommodate
approximately 350 people.
The remaining decks were modified to varying levels of complexity in order to
provide all the additional amenities, facilities, and furnishings we deemed necessary in
order to provide a desirable living space. These included:
•Fitness Center
53
•Indoor pool
•Parking garage
•Business center
•Grocery store
•Movie theater
•Multiple green spaces/outdoor park
•Daycare center
Weight removal and addition estimates were calculated on a per-deck basis in
order to determine a post-conversion weight estimate and facilitate post-conversion
stability analysis, which demonstrated improved stability performance compared to
the pre-conversion model.
To provide the major utilities required for onboard living–electricity, water, sewage,
waste management–we propose concurrent investments in pierside and shipboard in-
frastructure and equipment upgrades to allow the cruise ship to connect to the city’s
power, water, and waste distribution systems on a permanent basis. The continued
use of installed onboard systems to account for these needs proved either infeasible
or unwise, whereas investments in ship-to-shore power technology and interoperability
with the existing BWSC infrastructure were shown to have long-term environmental,
operational, and economical benefits. Despite this approach rendering much of the in-
stalled onboard equipment no longer necessary, we were unable to identify compelling
reasons to pursue large-scale engine room equipment removal. To this end, the final
design maintains the engine room largely in the as-is configuration but with systems
and equipment no longer necessary being retired in place in order to avoid undue
maintenance and upkeep costs. Moreover, to ensure the vessel’s relocatability, our de-
sign maintains two of the four main diesel engines in an operational status to provide
redundant sources of organic power generation.
Cost estimates for all aspects of the conversion process–acquisition, refurbish-
ment, retrofit, operations, maintenance, staffing–were estimated using comparable his-
torical data and SME input to determine the overall feasibility of the proposal. One
of the major assumptions maintained throughout the entire study was that all capital
and upfront fixed costs would be paid for through an assortment of government grants,
subsidies, and public funding. As such, the key cost consideration was whether the
annual net revenue from rent could cover the annual operational, staffing, and utilities
cost. We determined that the expected revenue would not fully cover all of these ex-
penses, but that this shortfall could be accounted for with a small amount of additional
public funding or more favorable utility discount rates.
Additional areas of study and recommendations are provided below. This project
determined that the conversion of a cruise ship into affordable housing is both techni-
cally and financially feasible, and offers crucial advantages over comparable land-based
approaches. To be sure, much of this argument hinges on the assumption of robust gov-
ernment support and financial backing, but that has proven itself an immutable truth
regarding affordable housing for decades, a truth that has come into even sharper relief
54
in recent years and is not unique to the converted cruise ship design.
This conversion study demonstrated that a project of this undertaking would not
fail due to infeasible challenges, but rather a failure to imagine a more dignified society
where housing is considered a fundamental right.
5.2 Areas for Study
Addressing Regulations. One of the major assumptions in this study was that
all relevant housing regulations, zoning laws, housing and marine fire and safety codes,
security protocols, and other legal ramifications were resolved in one form or another to
green light this conversion. In reality, these issues would all have to be systematically
resolved to determine which rules would apply to the converted cruise ship, which rules
could be waived or exempted since it is no longer operating as an actual seagoing ves-
sel, and which rules may have to be modified or specified to address the ship’s unique
status as a permanently moored vessel functioning as an affordable housing complex.
This is a major effort that will likely require government and housing agency mem-
bers, United States Coast Guard (USCG) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
officials, marine safety legal experts, ABS certification representatives, and others to
comprehensively ensure that all legal matters have been appropriately addressed and
approved.
Detailed Space and Engine Room Analysis. Throughout this conversion
study, our team had to make many assumptions concerning space arrangements, struc-
tural architecture, and existing onboard systems, due to the relative lack of detailed
information which is publicly available. For example, the 2D deck plans used as the
basis for arrangement modifications provided a starting point for an initial feasibility
and redesign assessment, but lacked the granularity to propose truly detailed changes.
Moreover, the unavailability of any sort of engine room drawing layout severely limited
our team’s ability to recommend meaningful changes within this space.
Having access to more official detailed ship information, perhaps through some
sort of partnership or agreement with RCG, will enable more specific redesign and
subsequent analysis concerning areas such as: overall weight estimates and locations,
the scope of retrofitting to enable the use of land-based utilities, intact and damaged
stability, and the structural integrity implications of merging and converting cabins.
Roll-Off, Roll-On Requirements. The inclusion of parking in our design was
considered a major boost to the design’s overall living desirability but is one of the more
challenging aspects of the conversion. A more rigorous structural engineering analysis
would need to be performed to determine if, and to what extent, deck strengthening is
required to ensure the structural safety of those decks with margin. Additionally, more
research and analysis are required to address how the parking garage entry would be
designed with respect to watertight integrity and SOLAS 90 compliance (or whatever
equivalent standard would be applied to the converted cruise ship).
Corrosion Control. Given that the converted cruise ship will be docked for the
vast majority of the time, our team felt confident in assessing that its service life could
be significantly extended past its nominal 30-year limit. The ship will not be subject
to any of the stresses normally associated with a seagoing vessel. The one exception
55
is corrosion. Since the hull will remain waterborne, it will still be subject to galvanic
corrosion, the most common and dangerous form of corrosion that ships experience.
Therefore, corrosion control will remain a pertinent concern that must be addressed in
the converted design.
Our team was unable to determine the specific corrosion control protocols cur-
rently implemented on the Rhapsody . The standard industry solution for decades has
been the use of sacrificial zinc anodes. These anodes, attached to the ship’s hull, are
more electrically reactive than the hull material, and therefore corrode and dissolve
instead of the hull itself. These anodes generally have to be replaced every three to
five years, dependent on the given ship’s drydocking schedule[90]. Newer RCG ships
are outfitted with Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) technology, which
provides longer-lasting active protection for up to 25 years.
Further research can determine what corrosion control technologies are already
in place, and how that would affect the converted ship’s long-term maintenance sched-
ule. If sacrificial anode swap-outs were to necessitate drydocking the ship every few
years, that would severely upend residents’ living arrangements and thus degrade the
concept’s overall feasibility. Initial research indicated that anode replacement can be
conducted while the ship is still in the water through the use of divers and special equip-
ment, but more detailed information on this method must be pursued to determine its
cost and impact on shipboard operations.
Alternative Energy Sources. As discussed in the feasibility analysis in Section
4.3, the calculated deficit between the annual operational cost estimate and revenue
from rent is only $100,000. Electrical power, at a cost of $2.3 million, was the largest
single contributor to the annual operational cost of the converted cruise ship design, as
discussed in Section 4.2.2. Even a small reduction in the cost for electricity could turn
this operational deficit into an income, increasing the feasibility of this conversion idea.
Supplementing shore power with alternative energy generation sources in the converted
design could reduce this electrical power cost and the demand on the electrical grid.
There are several examples of ships that use solar power as either the primary source
of power (MS Tˆ uranor PlanetSolar ) or as an auxiliary source ( Auriga Leader ,Emerald
Ace–shown in Figure 46), and a similar implementation could be done on the converted
cruise ship[91]. Further research into the use of solar power and other alternative energy
sources in this design is warranted.
Military Application. Beyond the affordable housing crisis afflicting millions
of citizens throughout the United States, military members are dealing with a similar
shortage of on-base housing. Living in on-base housing has become increasingly de-
sirable as the cost of living off-base has drastically increased over the past two years.
At Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina–one of the two
largest Marine Corps bases in the country–the wait time for some on-base housing
is 14-16 months, and this is an issue facing multiple military installations across the
country[92]. The U.S. Department of Defense is not equipped to rapidly address this
shortage of housing. In a recent interview with Newsweek, Pentagon Spokesperson
Major Charlie Dietz discussed the unique challenges in increasing on-base family hous-
ing, which can take five or more years to implement, citing the slow federal budget
cycle and requirements for congressional authorization and appropriations[93]. A con-
56

verted cruise ship could be a feasible approach to address this issue as well, particularly
because of the reduced construction required.
5.3 Recommendations
Upon completion of this project we determined that the conversion of a cruise ship
into affordable housing is a feasible and creative approach to address the housing crisis.
While there is certainly much more research and analysis to be done in the subject,
we hope our analysis has shown enough merit to warrant further pursuit of this idea.
The driving factors for our recommended continued research into this conversion idea
are summarized below:
•Purchasing a cruise ship instead of building an apartment complex from scratch
eliminates the ever-rising cost of construction. Some refurbishment and modifi-
cation will need to be done on the ship, but there is supporting data that these
costs are still significantly less expensive than constructing a new building.
•A cruise ship offers an incredibly large usable volume for both living spaces and
amenities. Even with our limited arrangement modifications, we were able to
retrofit the ship to provide 246 competitively-sized units and a wide range of
amenities that rival the most expensive luxury apartments in Boston.
•Over 80% of the nation’s population lives in coastal states along the oceans or the
Great Lakes[94]. Waterfront areas in major cities will always be some of the most
desirable locations to live and work. A cruise ship offers a unique opportunity to
add a large amount of housing to these locations, allowing people to live closer
to where they work.

A. Shore Power Investigation
In 2016, Boston city officials commissioned a shore power feasibility study as
part of a comprehensive modernization of operations plan within the Port of Boston
by Massport and its maritime partners[9]. Unlike military naval bases, the vast major-
ity of cruise ship ports are not equipped with shore-to-ship power (SSP) technology.
As of 2022, only 22 cruise ports had an SSP capability, which represents just 2% of
cruise ports worldwide[95]. However, there have been major efforts in recent years
to accelerate SSP technology implementation and availability in order to significantly
reduce vessel emissions while in-port. As the U.S. Navy has demonstrated for many
decades, shore power infrastructure has the potential to significantly reduce emissions
as it provides the ship’s auxiliary power needs through connections to the local electri-
cal grid, allowing vessels to turn off their engines while at berth[40]. Indeed, the Port
of Seattle estimated that connecting a ship to shore power for the average cruise ship
docking duration “eliminates the equivalent emissions to driving an average car from
Seattle to New York 30 times[95]. ”
These efforts have been further spurred on by the adoption of stricter emissions
and fuel standards by various regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the California
Air Resources Board (CARB). The IMO established its ship pollution rules in the “In-
ternational Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships” (MARPOL 73/78)
and has increasingly set forth increasingly stringent Tier I-Tier III standards through-
out the intervening years. These specifically govern the allowable emissions levels of
nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM) dependent
primarily on diesel engine size and speed. Additionally, there are designated Emission
Control Areas (ECA) around the world which implement yet stricter emissions control,
including a North American ECA which includes most of the United States coast[42].
More recently, CARB has instituted some of the most ambitious emission reduc-
tion targets and demanding standards. In 2007 they adopted the At-Berth Regulation
requiring the use of SSP or equivalent emissions reduction technology for container
ships, refrigerated cargo ships, & passenger ships in order to reduce PM and NOx
emissions starting in 2014[96]. A review of this regulation in 2020 reported an 80%
emission reduction, and the announcement of a more expansive updated regulation to
begin in 2023 for additional vessel types[97]. However, there are currently no corre-
sponding zero emissions standards or SSP technology mandates instituted for vessels
berthed at any United States East Coast ports.
The Massport case study documented many potential challenges to successfully
installing and operating SSP technology[9]. It was crucial to identify which of these
challenges would be common between the general use case ( i.e.cruise ships arriving and
departing on a roughly daily basis) and our goal of a permanently or semi-permanently
sited singular cruise ship converted to affordable housing.
New off and on-site electrical infrastructure would be required to dock a cruise
ship at the North Jetty Pier for an extended period of time. Previous studies indi-
cated that a new 40 MW substation would be required to support corresponding SSP

59
upgrades, at an estimated cost of $15 million[9]. However, this assumption was predi-
cated on the fact that a cruise ship represents a significant peak power demand on the
electrical grid. The study specifically used the roughly 3000-passenger vessel Queen
Mary 2 as the use case example and found that its peak power demand (13 MW )
exceeded the power demand of all the terminals combined at Logan International Air-
port (11 MW ). As such, the larger South Boston electrical infrastructure is currently
insufficient to handle this type of SSP electrical demand, thus begetting the need for
electrical grid upgrades within South Boston itself and not just at the port.
Figure 49: Basic schematic of SSP operations[9].
The converted cruise ship proposal crucially departs from some of these major
assumptions. First, given the expected cabin reduction schema to accommodate larger
and more desirable housing units, there will be significantly fewer personnel onboard
(by a projected order of magnitude) which will drastically drive down overall demand
compared to the typical large cruise ship. Moreover, the permanent siting of the ship at
the pier effectively eliminates the threat of unpredictable and excessive power-peaking
demands. There would be a generally known steady base demand with predictable
and reasonable peaks as exists in the typical residential housing complex. As such, it
is assumed that the city substation installation and upgrades, and the corresponding
$15 million cost, would not be necessary for the converted cruise ship.
Large capital costs are still incurred for shore power infrastructure upgrades. The
following cost data was obtained from the Massport provided shore power study[9]. It
was estimated based on previous SSP implementation projects in Halifax, Canada and
Brooklyn, New York that the shoreside capital investments would cost between $10-20
million per berth. Additionally, it was estimated that it would cost approximately $1
million to retrofit the ship with the necessary SSP upgrades. These costs would also be
incurred for the converted cruise ship proposal and would be significant contributors
to the project’s overall cost estimate.
60
Figure 50: Major equipment necessary to enable SSP technology [9].
However, it is essential to recognize that in nearly all of these previous infras-
tructure improvement ventures, there has been significant investment and funding by
government sources. The California government provided over $1 billion for air emis-
sions reduction-related projects and specifically allocated $80.4 million in state grants
to four of its major ports (Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego) to
support SSP infrastructure projects. The Port of Halifax received $5 million in fed-
eral grants and $2.5 million in state grants to support its single-berth SSP installation.
Brooklyn Cruise Terminal received $3 million in federal grants and $4.3 million in state
grants to help fund its single-berth SSP project.
Based on these numbers, and in properly adjusting for inflation, it is assumed
that the cost of installing the necessary pierside SSP infrastructure would be $17.3
million , and the cost to retrofit the ship itself would be $1.2 million , resulting in a
total cost estimate of $18.5 million .

F.Grand Celebration Case Study
On September 13, 2018, pressure build-up in natural gas lines owned by Columbia
Gas of Massachusetts caused a significant gas explosion in the Merrimack Valley, caus-
ing property damage to nearly 100 homes and resulting in one fatality[98]. In order
to repair the 48 miles of affected piping and restore services to the 8,600 affected cus-
tomers, Columbia Gas marshaled hundreds of additional gas workers from outside the
state, but there was insufficient conventional housing to support this sudden influx of
personnel for the three-month repair period.
Columbia Gas chartered the active cruise ship Grand Celebration from Bahamas
Paradise Cruise Line to provide housing in Boston for the construction crews, canceling
all previously scheduled sailings from October to December that year[99]. Massport was
tasked to support the vessel’s semi-permanent docking on an emergency basis invoked
by the state. Since Flynn Cruiseport itself was deemed a non-viable option given the
high-volume port schedule, Massport worked with regulatory agencies to instead site
the ship along the North Jetty Pier, located just north of the actual cruise terminal,
shown in Figures 4 & 59.
Within a very quick period, all essential services such as potable water, sewage,
gas, and electricity were established to varying levels of robustness. To provide sewage
transfer, an above-ground piping connection was made connecting the vessel’s onboard
holding tank to an existing sewage manhole which was part of the Boston sewage
distribution system. Small generators were brought pierside to provide the relatively
low electrical demand from the vessel, since the workers were off the ship for the
majority of the day. According to our subject matter expert at Massport, parking,
utility, and docking fees amounted to approximately $2 million for the three-month
period[27].
Despite the various challenges, Massport successfully supported the semi-permanent
docking of the Grand Celebration for over three months, and in doing so, provided
proof-of-concept viability to the idea of docking a cruise ship at the North Jetty Pier
on a more permanent basis. One major technical hurdle is the upgrade of pierside
infrastructure, support equipment, and utilities required to adequately support the
converted cruise ship around the clock. The cruise port itself has non-potable water
connections for washing and cleaning, but no permanent sewage connections since the
cruise ships are normally only there for a short duration. The temporary sewage con-
nections put in place for the Grand Celebration were adequate for short-term use, but
long-term usage would necessitate shifting from above-ground connections to perma-
nent underground connections more fully integrated with the overall sewage system.
Moreover, the generators brought pierside to provide the modest electricity needs of
Grand Celebration would not be viable to address the long-term needs of the converted
cruise ship. Indeed, addressing electricity production and distribution represents one
of the central and consequential tasks of this conversion project.

G. MIT 2N Cost Model
To get at least one estimate for TLC we used the MIT 2N Cost Model in full
recognition that this would be a very coarse approximation, particularly because it is
intended for new construction combatant vessels, not cheaply purchased cruise ship
conversions. This cost model incorporates estimates for research and development, ba-
sic construction, investments, operations and support, and residual value at the vessel’s
end of life. Although the current design only proposes one cruise ship conversion, for
the purposes of calculations, we assumed there would be one follow-on ship. We also
assumed there would be no propulsion requirements (to avoid fuel cost additions), ap-
proximated our staffing needs to fit the model inputs for Navy personnel manning, and
anticipated a 30-year service life. The adjusted TLC estimates from the MIT model
are shown in Figure 60.
