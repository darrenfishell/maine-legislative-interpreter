207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 2 An Act to End 
Chronic Homelessness by Creating the Housing First Fund 
' 
April 4, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, members of the Special Committee 
on Housing, l am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the Maine 
Community Action Partnership and we support LD 2 An Act to End 
Chronic Homelessness by Creating the Housing First Fund. 
LD 2 targets a minority of the homeless population in the state._ 
Although it is a minority, it is a population that gets a lot of attention, but 
not the kind it needs. For many years, in this building and in city council 
meetings we have talked about addressing the real problems people 
have, be it substance use, mental illness or trauma, with services that 
are there when people need them. We need to help people stay safe, 
as healthy as can be and to avoid emergency room visits unless 
necessary." 
Rather than people cycling between jail, the emergency room and 
shelters, providing a permanent place to call home will save lives and 
dollars. The funds proposed here, $8 — 9 million, sounds like a lot, but it 
pales in comparison to what we are now spending in MaineCare, jails 
and in what should be short term shelters. 
We are firm believers in the Housing First model, we know it works and 
we fully support the type of Housing First laid out in LD 2. 
We also know that large buildings for people who are chronically or 
even episodically homeless will not work in much of the state. In most 
cases, setting aside one unit in a four unit building or two in a ten unit 
building is more practical and just as effective. l hope that later this year 
or even next we can continue to work on this problem and its solutions 
together. 
Thank you for bringing this bill forward, l am happy to try to answer any 
questions you have. 1'
