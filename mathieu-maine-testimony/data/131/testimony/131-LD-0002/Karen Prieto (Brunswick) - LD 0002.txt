LD 2
Greetings, honorable members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing.
My name is Karen Staples Prieto. I grew up in Topsham, and now live in Brunswick 
after many years out of state. I am writing to testify in favor of LD 2, and urge you to 
please support this important step toward providing state-wide Site-based Housing 
First. 
I understand that people who are unsheltered experience dire health consequences in 
comparison to those who have the benefit of shelter, and consequently have a much 
higher consumption of public resources. In addition, people without shelter are more 
likely to experience houselessness for a longer duration.
By providing safe long-term shelter, the Portland Housing First program has helped 
people experiencing chronic houselessness address underlying issues more effectively
than if they had struggled to overcome them without a safe place to call home. 
LD 2 will allow us to extend Housing First programs throughout the state, providing 
supportive services and crisis intervention to maximize housing stability in both rural 
and urban communities.  
Mainers today still face high housing costs and health concerns that can interfere with
human individuals' fundamental right to have a safe place to sleep and conduct 
essential routine activities.
Please support this bill so that we can provide help to people who need it. Thank you 
for your time and attention.
Sincerely, Karen Prieto
