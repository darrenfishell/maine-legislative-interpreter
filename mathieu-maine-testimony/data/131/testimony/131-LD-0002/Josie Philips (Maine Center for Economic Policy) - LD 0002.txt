Maine Center for 
Economic Policy 2°Z..iii§ii; 
Good afternoon, chairpersons Gere and Pierce, and all members of the Housing Committee. My 
name is Josie Phillips, and I am representing the Maine Center for Economic Policy. I am 
testifying in favor of LD 2, An Act to Address Maine’s Housing Crisis. Housing First is a proven 
model to reduce or even eliminate chronic homelessness. This in turn helps alleviate the strain 
that chronic homelessness places on people experiencing homelessness and the financial 
burden homelessness places on our health care and criminal justice systems. 
First and foremost, Housing First is the most promising model we have to reduce 
homelessness. To maintain the kind of employment that allows people to pay for housing - 
something that has become increasingly difficult in Maine’s expensive housing market — people 
need to be healthy and have stability. Housing First provides both things, in the form of 
immediate housing and “wraparound sen/ices ” that connect clients with health care and sen/ices 
that support job searches. 
Without these supports, it is extremely difficult for people experiencing chronic homelessness to 
provide for themselves. lt is difficult to find or maintain a job when you do not have a permanent 
address or regular place to shower, or when you are dealing with untreated mental health 
challenges, which are commonly both a cause and result of homelessness. ‘ In short, once the 
floor has fallen out beneath you, it is nearly impossible to stand up again. Housing First is 
successful because it provides people with this floor, helping them to find their footing and climb 
back to a stable living arrangement where their needs can be met. This model of homelessness 
prevention is so successful that a literature review of Housing First programs across the country 
found that they reduce homelessness by 88 percent." Housing First is a repeatedly proven way 
by which we can provide Mainers experiencing chronic homelessness across the state with 
stability and support so they can work toward fully supporting themselves and their families and 
contribute to the broader economy. 
In addition to its many benefits to people experiencing chronic homelessness, Housing First is 
also a critical investment in the financial wellbeing of state and local budgets. Homelessness is 
a very expensive problem to state and local governments, and the costs of failing to address it 
are high?" Because of how we effectively criminalize homelessness “ and the many threats a 
lack of shelter poses to personal health, people experiencing homelessness frequently wind up 
either incarcerated or in hospital emergency departments. “ Both outcomes are costly to the 
person experiencing homelessness as well as state and local governments. In 2011, Maine’s 
Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability found that incarceration costs 
$42,538 per adult per year.“ Updated for inflation, this amount would equal $57,824 in present 
dollars."" Furthermore, each visit to hospital emergency departments can cost up to $1,714, 
depending on the severity of the case, not including costs of services like diagnostic labs or 
imaging." ‘" Because of the high costs of chronic homelessness, every dollar invested in Housing 
First saves an estimated $1.44.“ 
Taxpayers are already on the hook for homelessness through these costs to our criminal justice 
and health care systems. The choice before the legislature now is whether to put that money 
towards sustainable solutions rooted in care and prevention or towards a patchwork of costly 
band-aids rooted in punishment and ostracization. If the legislature wishes to end chronic 
homelessness in Maine, then it must pursue policies that increase the stock of housing

affordable to Mainers with low income. These solutions will take time to come to fruition, though, 
and homelessness is already threatening the safety and wellbeing of too many Mainers. 
Housing First is a necessary and demonstrably successful first step towards meeting the 
immediate needs of the more than 3,400 Mainers experiencing homelessness, and it would help 
address the racial inequity present in our housing system, as Black and Latino renters are 
disproportionately likely to have evictions filed against them, and more than one third of 
homeless Mainers are Black.’°" Because of this, I urge this committee to vote yes on LD 2.
