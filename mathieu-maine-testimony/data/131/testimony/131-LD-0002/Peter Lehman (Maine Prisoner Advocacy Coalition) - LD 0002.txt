Testimony in support of LD 2  
to the Joint Committee on H ousing  
April 4, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and Members of the Joint 
Committee on H ousing : 
My name is Peter Lehman and I live in Thomaston. I am a formerly 
incarcerated citizen and a person in long -term recovery. * I am 
testifying in favor of LD 2 on behalf of the Maine Prisoner 
Advocacy Coalition  whose goal is to promote restorative practices 
in order to increase public safety and the health of our community.   
Housing is a key element at both ends of our criminal legal 
system: housing issues  are often a serious factor in leading 
women and men to jail and prison .  
At the other end, t hose being released from our jails and face an 
enormous housing hurdle. Without adequate, safe housing we set 
them up for failure. And failure means additional criminality and 
additional victims.  
As a regular volunteer at the Augusta  Recovery Reentry Center, I 
see this every day. For me, these housing issues have names and 
faces as they struggle to get off this vicious merry -go-round â€”to 
get out of the cycle of homelessness, criminality, jail and prison.  
It costs us $78,000 per year to house someone at the Maine State 
Prison  and almost as much to keep them in jail. Housing First is a 
MUCH cheaper alternative.   
This legislation will help.  
Please unanimously vote Ought to Pass on LD 2.
