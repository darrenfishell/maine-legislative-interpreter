Senator
Pierce
and
Representative
Gere,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Select
Committee
on
Housing:
My
name
is
Hannah
Lindstrom
and
I
am
a
social
work
student
at
The
University
of
Maine,
Orono.
Ever
since
coming
to
college
in
Maine
I
have
always
wanted
to
move
to
Portland,
Maine
after
graduation.
However ,
my
plans
have
not
been
able
to
align
with
my
hopes/wishes.
The
cost
of
renting
an
apartment
is
outrageously
expensive
for
someone
with
a
Bachelor ’ s
degree
in
social
work.
Luckily ,
I
am
able
to
move
back
in
with
my
mother
in
Massachusetts.
However ,
this
does
mean
that
unfortunately
I
will
have
to
leave
the
state
of
Maine
and
Maine
will
also
lose
a
brand
new
social
worker
which
is
a
much
needed
position
here.
This
makes
me
so
afraid
for
people
from
mar ginalized/
vulnerable
communities.
People
who
do
not
have
family/friends
to
fall
back
on.
This
bill
has
the
ability
to
change
lives.
LD2
could
save
lives.
When
you
drive
through
cities
in
the
state
of
Maine
you
will
most
likely
run
into
multiple
unhoused
people
just
on
that
one
drive.
This
is
really
sad
and
very
scary
considering
the
harsh
weather
that
the
residents
of
Maine
have
to
endure.
I
strongly
ur ge
you
to
vote
“Y es”
on
LD
2.
Thank
you.
Respectfully
submitted,
