LD2 
To Chairpersons Teresa Pierce, Traci Gere, and the members of the Housing Committee: 
0 My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham, Maine. 
0 I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and Managers 
Association, GBAOMA. 
0 I am also a member of the Legislative Council working closely with, Attorney and Lobbyist, Dan 
Bernier representing landlords and property owners in, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, 
Portland, South Portland, Lewiston, Auburn, and Bangor areas. 
0 I have been a landlord since 1972. I have owned a 50-unit trailer park , multi-units, and single- 
family homes. At one time, I managed 65 units. I have mostly provided affordable housing to 
low-income tenants. 
0 I am speaking in SUPPORT of this Bill. 
0 There are many reasons why a person is homeless. The one that affects a landlord the most is 
that some people have never learned, or they have disregarded, how to be a good tenant. They 
need to realize that they are using someone else’s property, it is not theirs. They need to 
understand and honor the terms of the lease, be respectful of the landlord, and the other tenants 
who are also paying rent to live in that building. 
0 Just because they are paying rent, does not give them the right to act any way they want. Any 
problems or misunderstandings should be resolved with mutual respect. LD 2 is an opportunity 
for them to learn how to be a good tenant. 
0 In over 50 years of being a landlord, I have never evicted a good tenant! 
0 I am here to ask you to SUPPORT LD 2.' 
0 Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. I would be happy to answer any questions.
