LD 2
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and members of the Housing Committee,
I represent no entity or agency and cannot take a position on LD2 as it includes no 
body of legislative work to review. It sounds nice, but is only statement of intent with 
no presented path or ideas on how to get there.
I do support SP0010 to eliminate concept drafts such as this, as these 'markers' or 
'slots' undermine democracy, paralyze participation, reduce FOAA transparency, and 
strain credibility and public trust.
Let's do the work first, present it, openly participate, deliberate, then decide.
Thanks.
Dan
