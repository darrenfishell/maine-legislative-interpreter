The General Election is okay the way is has been run for years. The Democrats and 
bumbling idiots are trying to ruin this country and I am not going to sit back and take 
it. I will voice my concerns for this USA and the State of Maine. The Distribution 
Amounts need to stay the way they have been distributed. I am opposed to this
