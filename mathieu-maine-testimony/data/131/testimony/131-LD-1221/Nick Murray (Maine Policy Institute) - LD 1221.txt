Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1221,
“An
Act
to
Make
Changes
to
the
Distribution
Amounts
to
Certain
Maine
Clean
Election
Act
Candidates
in
Contested
General
Elections”
Senator
Hickman,
Representative
Supica,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Veterans
and
Legal
Affairs,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1221.
Even
though
the
Maine
Clean
Elections
Act
(MCEA)
has
failed
to
deliver
on
proponents'
claims
of
greater
electoral
competitiveness
and
legislative
diversity,
Maine
taxpayers,
despite
their
individual
political
views,
are
still
forced
to
subsidize
political
campaigns.
Maine
has
spent
more
than
$44
million
on
taxpayer-funded
political
campaigns
to
date.
In
2018,
the
state
spent
more
than
$6
million,
a
90%
increase
from
2016,
largely
due
to
the
disbursements
to
three
gubernatorial
primary
campaigns.

This
legislature
should
completely
repeal
the
MCEA,
but
passing
LD
1221
will
help
to
reduce
potential
runaway
costs
of
the
program
by
limiting
the
amount
of
public
funds
politicians
may
receive
to
run
their
campaigns.

Legislators
should
be
especially
wary
of
unknown
spending
lines,
given
the
current
majority
budget
spends
98%
of
all
projected
revenue
over
the
next
two
years.
Despite
the
MCEA’s
stated
goals,
negativity
in
campaigns
and
special
interest
money
have
never
been
more
widespread
in
Maine
politics.
This
is
in
line
with
national
trends
over
recent
decades.
Politics
is
a
rough
game,
and
while
we
encourage
all
Mainers
to
get
involved
in
the
public
policy
process,
no
one
should
be
forced
to
participate
in
it,
directly
or
indirectly,
if
they
so
choose.
As
a
501(c)3
nonprofit,
Maine
Policy
Institute
is
prohibited
from
engaging
in
election
or
campaign
activity,
yet
the
state
may
disburse
public
money
to
political
candidates
and
implicate
Maine
taxpayers
in
the
messages
and
advertisements
of
politicians
with
whom
they
may
disagree.
Tax
dollars
should
not
be
used
to
pay
for
political
consultants
or
mail
pieces.
A
viable
candidate
should
be
able
to
attract
voluntary
contributions.
Shouldn’t
those
who
finance
political
campaigns
have
some
interest
in
doing
so?
What
better
method
then
are
voluntary,
individual
contributions
for
providing
transparency,
and
securing
the
right
to
choose
one’s
level
of
engagement
in
the
political
system?
Not
only
does
the
MCEA
force
taxpayers
to
financially
support
candidates
with
whom
they
may
disagree,
but
the
program
has
cost
Mainers
millions
of
dollars
over
the
last
decade.
Though
the
MCEA
has
often
been
touted
as
a
way
to
level
the
playing
field
between
candidates,
a
University
of
Maine
review
of
20
elections
revealed
that
“electoral
competitiveness
in
Maine
has
not
been
appreciably
affected
by
MCEA.”
2
This
is
likely
due
to
the
emergence
of
PACs
and
outside
special
interest
groups
which
have
allowed
“clean”
candidates
to
receive
taxpayer
funding
while
enjoying
the
support
of
deep-pocketed
donors.
Any
rationale
for
taxpayer-funded
candidates
fails
to
take
into
account
this
basic
law
of
politics:
money
finds
a
way.
Please
rein
in
MCEA
spending
that
could
cause
unneeded
stress
to
the
state
budget;
deem
LD
1221
“Ought
to
Pass.”
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
