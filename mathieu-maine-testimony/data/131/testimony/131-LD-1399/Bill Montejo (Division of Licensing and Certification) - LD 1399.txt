Re: LD 1399  - An Act to Improve State Oversight of Proposed Health Care Entity Transactions  
   
Senator Bailey , Representative Perry , honorable members of the Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance, and Financial  Services :  
 
Thank you for the opportunity  to provide information on LD 1399 , An Act to Improve State 
Oversight of Proposed Health Care Entity  Transactions . 
 
The Division of Licensing and Certification (DLC) and Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) shares concerns about market consolidation  in healthcare. While this can provide a safety 
net for facilities and services that are less lucrative, it can also create  access issues and limit 
consumer options  with respect to cost and quality .  
 
This bill def ines a material change transaction involving a health care entity, creates a process for 
review of a material change transaction and requires the Attorney General to review and approve 
or deny any material change transaction.  
 
However, DLC believe s this proposed bill overlap s, and in some ways duplicates , our current 
Certificate of Need (CON) statute  and the subsequent responsibilities and functions of DHHS  (See 
Title 22 §329). DHHS  currently has  oversight over the finances ( including audit, rate-setting, 
CON,  and data analytics) and quality ( licensing) of many of the providers cited in the proposed 
bill. This bill creates similar functions  and responsibilities  in the Attorney General’s Office (OAG).  
 
I want to thank you for your consideration of  this issu e. I would be happy to answer any questions 
you may have and can be available for your work session if needed.  
 
Sincerely,   
  
 
Bill Montejo, Director   
Division of Licensing and Certification
