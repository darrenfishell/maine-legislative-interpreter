"Resolve,
Directing

Department

to
Update
Course

of

and

Major
Substantive

Dear
Senator
Rafferty,
Representative
Brennan
and
the
Distinguished
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Affairs:
To
All
It
May
Concern
and
Who
are
Concerned:
I
am
somewhat
reluctantly
writing
to
you
in
support
of
LD1020.
The
problem
of
finding
qualified
teachers
to
fill
vacant
positions
in
remaining
Industrial
Arts/Technology
Education
programs
is
deeply
rooted
in
a
far
bigger
problem.
A
major
part
of
that
problem
is
a
philosophical
one;
going
back
decades,
where
administrators
and
policy
makers
have
failed
to
recognize
the
potential
and
the
objectives
as
to
the
role
of
Industrial
Arts
(Technology
Education)
in
the
education
of
all
children
grades
k-12.
Unfortunately
Industrial
Arts
was
relegated
to
a
role
to
serve;
for
the
most
part,
male
students
identified
as
under
achievers
and
those
most
likely
not
going
to
college,
but
directly
to
the
workforce.
If
we
took
100
students
who
entered
high
school
as
freshman;
83
would
graduate
from
high
school
four
years
later.
Of
that
83;
46
would
enroll
in
post
secondary
education.
Of
the
46
who
went
on
to
some
form
of
post
secondary
education
13
will
graduate
with
some
type
of
college
degree.
Interestingly
enough
only
4
will
work
in
jobs
related
to
their
field
of
study.
Perhaps
2
of
those
will
earn
over
$60K
annually.
So
I
have
to
ask;
where
have
we
gone
wrong?
Industrial
Arts/Technology
Education’s
primary
objective
is
not
about
building
skills
for
the
workforce
as
its
major
objective/s.
First
and
foremost
Industrial
Arts/Technology
Education
is
designed
as
a
K-12
curriculum
to
provide
students
from
a
very
early
age
to
actively
engage
in
a
developmentally
appropriate
“hands-on,
minds-on”
education.
One
which
provides
young
minds
opportunities
to
problem
solve,
to
create,
to
design,
to
build,
to
engineer,
to
test,
perhaps
succeed/perhaps
fail,
but
to
learn
from
either,
and
to
evaluate
what
worked,
or
what
did
not,
and
why?
After
all,
the
Wright
Brothers
did
not
fly
on
their
first
try.
Utilizing
this
methodology
(Dewey-project
method)
allows
students
to
use
math,
science,
and
reading,
designed
to
make
education
a
more
interesting
place
to
learn
things
as
an
active
learner.
Students
are
introduced
to
tools,
machines,
equipment,
materials,
processes,
spatial
reasoning,
measurement,
experimentation,
problem
solving,
developing
solutions
to
developmentally
appropriate
problems,
exciting
young
minds,
exploring
multiple
areas,
building
confidence,
learning
about
teamwork,
learning
about
how
“things”
work
and
how
things
are
made.
Industrial
Arts/Technology
Education
(
a
name
change
that
is
part
of
the
problem)
needs
to
be
a
part
of
every
child’s
education;
male
and
female
K-12.
It
needs
to
be
taught
by
educators
who
understand
the
methodology
and
process
and
the
goals
of
such
programming.
Ultimately
students
will
have
had
the
opportunity
to
explore,
experiences
to
broaden
minds
and
to
open
minds
as
to
the
possibilities
and
the
strong
connections
of
subject
matter.
This
type
of
programming
is
highly
multidisciplinary
and
very
interdisciplinary
when
designed
with
cross
curricular
goals
in
mind.
Math
occurs
“outside”
the
classroom,
science
occurs
“outside”
the
classroom…most
educational
courses/classes
can
and
should
be
taught
in
a
cross-curricular
way
for
the
benefit
of
our
kids.
At
Wiscasset
High
School
our
program
provided
students
in
an
Industrial
Arts/Technology
facility
that
exposed
students
to
numerous
exploratory
areas:
Architecture,
Building
Construction,
Design
&
Engineering,
Product
Design,
Technical/Mechanical
Drawing/CAD,
Technological
Development
1
&
2,
Woodworking,
Metalworking,
Furniture
Making,
Musical
Instrument
Making,
Auto
Maintenance,
Boatbuilding,
Electricity,
Power
Mechanics,
and
Video
&
TV
Production.
We
introduced
students
to
work
independently
in
work
stations/modules
such
as
Computer
Animation
3D
Studio,
CAD
Architecture,
Robotics,
Lasers
and
Fiber
Optics,
Rocketry/Living
in
Space,
Electricity,
Electronics,
Precision
Measurement,
Aviation/Flight,
Navigation/Mapping
&
GPS,
Pneumatics,
Hydraulics,
Small
Engines,
Radio
Broadcasting/POD
casts,
Video
Editing
&
Video
Production-producing
their
own
“how
to”
video,
and
CNC
machines.
I
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
many
students,both
male
and
female,
remain
in
contact
with
me
over
the
years
,
and
they
have
repeatedly
expressed
and
provided
the
feedback
relating
to
the
importance
of
their
experiences
in
“shop”
class,
ie-IA/TE,
has
played
in
their
lives.
Experiences
which
they
have
identified
in
retrospect.
Ultimately
moving
forward
Industrial
Arts/Technology
Education
becomes
the
IA/TE
Resource
Center,
the
Makers
Labs-
these
facilities
should
be
designed
and
built
in
as
a
key
components
in
all
the
schools
in
Maine-
Elementary,
Middle
School
and
High
Schools.
We
can
do
this.
In
the
70’s
all
new
schools
had
these
facilities
and
many
required
at
the
6,7
&
8
grade
levels
that
all
students
as
part
of
their
core
experience
take
these
courses.
Unfortunately,
shifts
towards
“all
students”
will
attend
college
impacted
these
types
of
classes,
well;
here
we
are
in
the
21st
century
now
questioning,
was
that
emphasis
on
college
at
the
expense
of
IA/TE
the
right
way
to
go?
I
think
we
know
the
answer
to
that.
I
would
encourage
the
committee
to
pass
LD1020,
but
not
to
stop
at
this
point,
thinking
the
problem
has
been
solved.
This
is
merely
a
band-aid
solution
that
will
perhaps
save
existing
programs.
The
legislature
needs
to
take
further
action
to
Bring
back
the
degree
program
for
teaching
and
training
Industrial
Arts/Technology
Teachers
at
the
University
of
Maine-Gorham,
provide
opportunities
for
all
educators
to
experience
the
potential
of
this
programing,
refocus
on
the
needs
of
all
students
and
the
ways
we
learn,
and
finally,
provide
funding
to
rebuild
IA/TE
programs
in
Maine
schools.
Lastly,
do
not
confuse
the
goals
and
objectives
of
IA/TE
with
those
of
Career
and
Technical
Centers,
both
play
important
roles;
however
the
CTC’s
are
ideally
designed
for
those
students
who
have
elected
to
pursue
a
career
in
a
CTC
offering,
while
IA/TE
allows
students
to
explore
and
experience
potentially
multiple
careers
but
career
training
not
the
primary
focus.
I
would
urge
the
committee
to
review
