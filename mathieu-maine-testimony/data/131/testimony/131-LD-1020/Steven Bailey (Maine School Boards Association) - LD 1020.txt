TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 1020 
RESOLVE, DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO UPDATE 
COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION OF INDUSTRIAL ARTS TEACHERS 
AND TO FINALLY ADOPT MAJOR SUBSTANTIVE RULES 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 1020. 
Our associations support any alternative pathway that would allow for engineers or other employees in the 
trades ﬁeld to gain certiﬁcation based on their credentials and not just seat time. 
We know the ce _rtiﬁcation rules were recently reviewed and believe this was discussed by those involved. It 
makes sense to allow actual hands-on work experience to count toward certiﬁcation in what is most certainly 
a hands-on ﬁeld.
