Re: Written testimony in support of LD 1020 "Resolve, Directing the
Department of Education to Update Course Requirements for Certification of
Industrial Arts Teachers and to Finally Adopt Major Substantive Rules"
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and the Distinguished
Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs:
Maine needs a technologically literate citizenry and workforce, and it is the goal of 
Technology and Engineering (T & E) Education to develop this literacy. Maine has not 
produced a technology (and engineering) teacher since the early 2000’s due to the 
elimination of the teacher preparation program at the University of Southern Maine, and 
the majority of the current T & E teachers are approaching retirement age. LD 1020 
“Resolve, Directing the Department of Education to Update Course Requirements for 
Certification of Industrial Arts Teachers and to Finally Adopt Major Substantive Rules" 
has the potential to addresses these needs by allowing engineering coursework to fulfill 
the technical course requirements for obtaining a 700 Certification. As one who is 
concerned about the future of the state and of engineering and technology education in 
Maine, I strongly support this legislation and encourage the Distinguished Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs to do the same.
Sincerely,
Ethan J. Whited
