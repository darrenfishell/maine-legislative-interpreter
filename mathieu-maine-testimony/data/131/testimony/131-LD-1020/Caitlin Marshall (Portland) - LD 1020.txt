Testimony in SUPPORT of LD 730
An Act to Provide Traffic Safety Education in Maine Schools 
 
Good Afternoon Chairs Rafferty and Brennan, and Members of the Committee. My name is 
Caitlin Marshall and I am a parent and bike-rider (and pedestrian, of course) from the North 
Deering neighborhood of Portland.  I am writing today to urge you to vote in SUPPORT of LD 
730.
 
I support this bill because I want all our kids to feel safe on the streets!  My kids are 8 and 5, 
and they love to ride their bikes.  They are eager to go farther, and my older kid would even 
like to bike to school on his own.  However, the route to school would take him on 
Washington Avenue - a big road, with many commuters.  I don’t trust that drivers on this road 
are aware enough of how to share the road safely.  It can be done! But it needs to be taught.
Biking and walking to get around is healthy, and this curriculum fits PE / Health Education 
mandates.  Biking to school and work is huge step in the right direction of using less fossil 
fuels - a goal specifically stated by Maine’s climate plan, and absolutely necessary if we’re 
going to leave anything like a livable future for these kids.  And of course it is fun!  Both my 
parents grew up biking all over town, and loved the freedom and independence.  As our roads
are full of more and more cars now, it is imperative that we get better at sharing the road, so 
we can get back to kids (and adults!) happily zooming around on bikes.
 
For these reasons I urge the committee to support LD 730 and vote for “ought to pass” 
Committee Report.
 
Thank you for your time.
 
Sincerely
