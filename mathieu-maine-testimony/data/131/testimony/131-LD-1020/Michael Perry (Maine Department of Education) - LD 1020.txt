Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committees:  
LD 1020 , Resolve, Directing the Department of Educati on to Update Course Requirements for 
Certification of Industrial Arts Te achers and to Finally Adopt Major Substantive Rules  proposes 
that the DOE update the certification requirements for k -12 industrial arts ( IA) teachers to align 
with the course offerings of U niversity of Maine System  and to allow licensed engineers to be 
eligible for certification as K -12 IA teachers without taking the courses.  
Industrial Arts is considered a Pk -12 teaching area and as such, req uires additional training  in 
comparison to career and technical education ( CTE ) endorsements , e.g. coursework in 
educational methods.   It is not the practice of the Department of Education to align certification 
expectations with any educational institutionâ€™s programmatic  preferences. Rather, the  
certification expectation s are established through the comprehensive rulemaking process.  
Chapter  115: The Credentialing of Education Personnel recently underwent a revision process 
and was updated effective Ju ne 10 , 2022.  This bill would require the reopening of rule Chapter 
115: T he Credentialing of Education Personnel , which is a major substantive rule of the State Board 
of Education . 
All aspiring teachers are expected to complete education -specific coursework that demonstrates 
pedagogical knowledge in key areas of instruction, curriculum, and student experience.   For instance, 
student t eaching is a crit ical part of training that provides an immersive experience for pre -service 
teachers.  The Department remains  open to additional flexibility for certification pathways. 
Workforce experience can be a viable alternative pathway, and we look forward to discussions 
around the particulars of how to make a workforce experience pathway work for teacher certification.   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1020  and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
Michael Perry
