LD 1902
 In 2019,  Maine passed one of the strongest laws in the nation on internet privacy. 
That law prohibited internet service providers from using, disclosing, selling, or 
permitting access to your personal information without your permission. It also 
required companies to take reasonable steps to protect your privacy, and prohibited 
providers from refusing to serve customers who don't opt-in. The bill passed 85-45 in 
the Maine house and passed the Maine senate unanimously.
LD 1973 removes many protections that the 2019 legislation provides.  I urge the 
Maine legislators to protect Maine residents internet privacy and personal information
by rejecting LD 1973.  
I also urge Maine legislators to support LD 1902, which sets a high standard for 
Mainers' health data, including with a right to take private action against violators. 
This is the model we should build upon in Maine. 
Protecting our privacy is paramount!
