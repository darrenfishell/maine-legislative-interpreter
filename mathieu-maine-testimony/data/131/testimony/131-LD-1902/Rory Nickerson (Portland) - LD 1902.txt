LD 1902
Dear Judiciary Committee Members, 
I write to ask for your support of LD 1902.
Apps, web searches, and smartwatches that collect our health lack basic data privacy 
protections. As Mainers we expect better, especially for sensitive personal health data.
Most people don't know the risks involved with using unprotected health apps. We 
deserve better protections and better information about what will happen to our data. 
These protections are especially important now that states across the country are 
restricting access to abortion and gender-affirming care. The only people that don't 
want these protections are the big companies that exploit our sensitive data.
Please support LD 1902.
Thank you for your consideration.
