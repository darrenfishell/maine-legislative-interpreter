Re:

L.D.
1902,
Maine
Health
Privacy
Legislation
—
SUPPORT
Dear
Chair
Carney
and
Chair
Moonen,
Consumer
Reports
sincerely
thanks
you
for
your
work
to
advance
consumer
privacy
in
Maine.
L.D.
1902
would
extend
to
Maine
consumers
important
new
protections
relating
to
their
personal
health
data,
including
prohibitions
against
collecting
or
sharing
consumer
health
data
without
af firmative
opt-in
consent,
a
ban
on
data
sales,
the
right
to
know
the
personal
health
data
companies
have
collected
about
them
and
well
as
the
right
to
delete
that
information.
Many
companies
that
collect
especially
sensitive
personal
information,
including
personal
health
data,
are
failing
to
safeguard
it.
For
example,
a
2021
Consumer
Reports
investigation
into
seven
of
the
leading
mental
health
apps
showed
that
they
had
significant
privacy
issues:
many
shared
user
and
device
information
with
social
media
companies
and
all
had
confusing
privacy
policies
that
few
consumers
would
understand.

Similarly ,
the
Federal
T rade
Commission
has
recently
enforced
against
several
companies
that
improperly
shared
personal
health
information
with

third-parties
or
broke
their
privacy
promises
to
consumers,
including
fertility
tracker
apps
Flo

and
Premom

,
online
counseling
service
BetterHelp
4
,
and
online
prescription
company
GoodRx.
5
Even
when
companies
do
not
outright
lie
about
their
privacy
protections,
the
hazy
bounds
of
existing
privacy
law
further
complicate
consumers’
ability
to
understand
company
data
practices.
In
a
2023
study
headed
by
University
of
Pennsylvania
researchers,
82%
of
consumers
didn’ t
realize
that
HIP AA
does
not
apply
to
many
health-related
data
in
mobile
apps.
6
As
a
result,
many
consumers
share
sensitive
health
information
with
businesses
under
the
illusion
that
it
has
preexisting
legal
protections,
when,
in
many
cases,
none
exist.
Lawmakers
need
to
remedy
this
imbalance.
At
a
minimum,
businesses
should
be
required
to
transparently
communicate
to
consumers
when
they
are
collecting
and
sharing
health
data,
and
this
data
should
only
be
disclosed
if
consumers
give
an
af firmative
opt-in
consent.
While
Consumer
Reports
would
prefer
a
framework
that
prevents
the
collection
and
secondary
use
of
personal
health
data
for
any
purposes
other
than
providing
the
service
requested
by
the
consumer ,
we
are
glad
to
see
that
L.D.
1902
includes
strong
protections
that
would
improve
consumer
privacy .
In
particular ,
we
appreciate
that
L.D.
1902
includes:
●
A
str ong
definition
of
consumer
health
data.
The
definition
of
consumer
health
data
included
in
this
legislation
covers
key
categories
of
personal
information
consumers
may
share
with
businesses
that
deserve
additional
protection,
including
among
others,
health
conditions
and
interventions,
biometric
or
genetic
data,
use
or
purchase
of
medication,
and
gender -af firming
care.

Restrictions
on
collecting
and
sharing
without
consent
and
pr ohibition
on
sales.
L.D.
1902
requires
that
regulated
entities
obtain
separate,
specific
consents
to
respectively
collect
and
share
consumer
health
data.
It
also
bans
the
sale
of
consumer
health
data
outright.
Importantly ,
the
bill
requires
that
any
consent
to
shar e
consumer
health
data
must
be
obtained
separately
from
consent
to
collect
consumer
health
data,
which
itself
cannot
be
bundled
into
a
general
terms
of
service.
However ,
we
note
that
the
distinction
between
sharing
and
selling
is
often
blurry ,
and
may
be
confusing
to
consumers.
Instead
of
bifurcating
sharing
and
sales
into
separate
frameworks,
we
suggest
prohibiting
all
data
disclosures
to
third-parties
unless
reasonably
necessary
to
provide
the
service.
●
Str ong
enfor cement.
Given
the
AG’ s
limited
resources,
a
private
right
of
action
is
key
to
incentivizing
companies
to
comply
and
we
appreciate
that
one
is
included
in
the
bill.
W e
strongly
encourage
legislators
to
retain
this
provision
going
forward.
Under
an
AG-only
enforcement
framework,
businesses
that
recognize
that
the
AG
is
only
capable
of
bringing
a
handful
of
enforcement
actions
each
year
might
simply
ignore
the
law
and
take
their
chances
in
evading
detection.
Further ,
it’ s
appropriate
that
consumers
are
able
to
hold
companies
accountable
in
some
way
for
violating
their
rights.
●
Pr ohibitions
on
geofencing.
Individuals
should
be
able
to
receive
in-person
health
care
services
without
fearing
that
companies
are
tracking
their
visits
and/or
disclosing
that
information
to
additional
third-parties.
Potential
uses
or
disclosure
of
such
information
could
result
in
consequences
that
range
from
embarrassing
to
outright
adversarial.
For
example,
businesses
could
share
healthcare
visit
information
with
insurance
companies
who
could
then
use
it
as
a
basis
to
increase
monthly
premiums.
Some
third-parties
may
even
disclose
or
be
forced
to
disclose
geofenced
data
with
law
enforcement.
L.D.
1902
appropriately
bans
such
activity .
W e
note
one
loophole
that
should
be
closed
in
order
to
provide
Maine
consumers
with
the
protections
they
deserve:
●
Clarify
that
the
non-discrimination
pr ovision
means
price
or
service
discrimination.
While
we
appreciate
that
the
bill
prohibits
regulated
entities
from
discriminating
against
consumers
that
exercise
their
rights
under
this
act,
the
term
“discriminate”
is
not
defined
or
otherwise
explained,
which
could
lead
regulated
entities
from
construing
the
term
narrowly .
For
that
reason,
we
ur ge
the
drafters
to
specifically
include
prohibitions
against
price
and
service
discrimination.
Additionally ,
the
legislation
should
ensure
that
the
non-discrimination
provisions
apply
to
all
consumer
rights
under
the
bill,
including
those
in
Section
1350-R.
W e
suggest
the
following
language:
(a)
A
business
shall
not
discriminate
against
a
consumer
because
the
consumer
exer cised
any
of
the
consumer ’ s
rights
under
Section
1350-Q
or
Section
1350-R,
or
did
not
agr ee
to
information
pr ocessing
for
a
separate
pr oduct
or
service,
including,
but
not
limited
to,
by:
(1)
Denying
goods
or
services
to
the
consumer .
(2)
Char ging
differ ent
prices
or
rates
for
goods
or
services,
including
thr ough
the
use
of
discounts
or
other
benefits
or
imposing
penalties.
(3)
Pr oviding
a
differ ent
level
or
quality
of
goods
or
services
to
the
consumer .
(4)
Suggesting
that
the
consumer
will
r eceive
a
differ ent
price
or
rate
for
goods
or
services
or
a
differ ent
level
or
quality
of
goods
or
services.
W e
look
forward
to
working
with
you
to
ensure
that
Maine
consumers
have
the
strongest
possible
privacy
protections.
Sincerely ,
Matt
Schwartz
Policy
Analyst
