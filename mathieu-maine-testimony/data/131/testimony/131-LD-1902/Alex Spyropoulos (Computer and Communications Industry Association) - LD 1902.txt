Dear
Co-Chair
Carney,
Co-Chair
Moonen,
and
Members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary:
On
behalf
of
the
Computer
&
Communications
Industry
Association
(CCIA),
I
write
to
respectfully
oppose
LD
1902,
An
Act
to
Protect
Personal
Health
Data.
CCIA
is
an
international,
not-for-proﬁt
trade
association
representing
a
broad
cross-section
of
communications
and
technology
ﬁrms.
1
CCIA
supports
the
enactment
of
comprehensive
federal
privacy
legislation
to
promote
a
trustworthy
information
ecosystem
characterized
by
clear
and
consistent
consumer
privacy
rights
and
responsibilities
for
organizations
that
collect
and
process
data.
A
uniform
federal
approach
to
the
protection
of
consumer
privacy
throughout
the
economy
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
businesses
have
regulatory
certainty
in
meeting
their
compliance
obligations
and
that
consumers
are
able
to
exercise
their
rights.
CCIA
appreciates,
however,
that
in
the
absence
of
baseline
federal
privacy
protections,
state
lawmakers
are
attempting
to
ﬁll
in
the
gaps.
To
inform
these
efforts,
CCIA
produced
a
set
of
principles
to
promote
fair
and
accountable
data
practices.
2
CCIA
strongly
supports
the
protection
of
consumer
data
and
understands
that
Maine
residents
are
rightfully
concerned
about
the
proper
safeguarding
of
their
data,
particularly
when
it
comes
to
their
health
information.
However,
as
currently
written,
LD
1902
includes
several
provisions
that
raise
concerns.
We
appreciate
the
committee’s
consideration
of
our
comments
regarding
several
areas
for
potential
improvement.

@ C C I A n e t
While
CCIA
understands
and
supports
the
intent
of
the
legislation,
LD
1902
deﬁnes
“consumer
health
data”
so
broadly
that
it
would
include
data
about
daily
consumer
activities
and
purchases,
by
including
“efforts
to
research
or
obtain
health
services
or
supplies”
and
any
data
that
relates
to
“products
that…afﬁrm
an
individual’s
gender
identity,”
or
are
related
to
“bodily
functions”.
This
broad
deﬁnition
could
apply
to
regular
purchase
items
such
as
feminine
care
products,
sexual
health
products,
undergarments,
or
items
as
simple
as
toilet
paper.
By
including
routine
purchases
such
as
hygienic
products
within
the
scope
of
this
legislation,
consumers
would
constantly
be
required
to
provide
consent
in
the
course
of
normal
transactions.
This
would
inevitably
lead
to
consent
fatigue
while
not
actively
contributing
to
accomplishing
the
legislation’s
intent.
The
deﬁnition
of
location
data
should
also
be
more
narrowly
tailored.
CCIA
suggests
adjusting
the
language
to
“precise
location
data
that
could
reasonably
indicate
a
consumer’s
primary
purpose
to
acquire
or
receive
reproductive
or
sexual
health
services”
or
targeting
the
deﬁnition
to
data
that
regulated
entities
may
use
to
determine
whether
individuals
have
accessed
reproductive
or
gender-afﬁrming
care
services,
as
this
would
better
accomplish
the
legislation’s
goals
while
preserving
the
utility
of
other
consumer
services.
As
currently
written,
a
device
would
not
be
able
to
collect
a
consumer’s
current
location
data
to
provide
them
with
directions
to
where
they
are
seeking
to
go,
whether
that
be
home,
the
nearest
grocery
store,
or
otherwise.

LD
1902
permits
consumers
to
bring
legal
action
against
companies
that
have
been
accused
of
violating
new
regulations.
By
creating
a
new
private
right
of
action,
the
measure
would
open
the
doors
of
Maine’s
courthouses
to
plaintiffs
advancing
frivolous
claims
with
little
evidence
of
actual
injury.
Lawsuits
also
prove
extremely
costly
and
time-intensive
–
it
is
foreseeable
that
these
costs
would
be
passed
on
to
individual
consumers
in
Maine,
disproportionately
impacting
smaller
businesses
and
startups
across
the
state.
Further,
every
state
that
has
established
a
comprehensive
consumer
data
privacy
law
–
California,
Colorado,
Connecticut,
Indiana,
Iowa,
Utah
and
Virginia
–
has
opted
to
invest
enforcement
authority
with
their
respective
state
attorney
general.
This
allows
for
the
leveraging
of
technical
expertise
concerning
enforcement
authority,
placing
public
interest
at
the
forefront.
CCIA
recommends
that
the
legislation
be
amended
to
include
a
cure
period
of
at
least
30
days.
This
would
allow
for
actors
operating
in
good
faith
to
correct
an
unknowing
or
technical
violation,
reserving
formal
lawsuits
and
violation
penalties
for
the
bad
actors
that
the
bill
intends
to
address.
This
would
also
focus
the
government’s
limited
resources
on
enforcing
the
law’s
provisions
for
those
that
persist
in
violations
despite
being
made
aware
of
such
alleged
violations.
Such
notice
allows
consumers

receive
injunctive
relief,
but
without
the
time
and
expense
of
bringing
a
formal
suit.
Businesses
would
also
be
better
equipped
with
the
time
and
resources
to
address
potential
privacy
changes
rather
than
shifting
focus
to
defending
against
litigation.

proposals
related
to
technology
policy.
