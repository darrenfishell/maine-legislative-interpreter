Re: Testimony in Support of LD 1902, An Act to Protect Personal Health Data 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and fellow members of the Judiciary Committee, my 
name is Emily Gorrivan and I live in Portland, Maine. I am writing today as a concerned citizen 
to testify in support of LD 1902, An Act to Protect Personal Health Data. 
 
LD 1902 provides basic privacy protections for data that is not covered under Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As stated by the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Washington  “[p]eriod tracking apps, people’s location history, and even their shopping patterns 
can expose a lot about a person’s health – all data not protected by HIPAA.” 
 
This data abuse may result in barriers to abortion and gender-affirming care. However, Maine 
has the opportunity to create protections – protections that are urgently needed in the wake 
of regressive policies passed by neighboring states and a major reversal of the Roe decision by 
the U.S. Supreme Court. With this bill, businesses and non-governmental organizations will be 
restricted from collecting, using, retaining, or disclosing reproductive health information that 
isn't essential to providing the service someone asks them for. 
 
Our health data is sensitive, and the stakes for misuse are high. I urge the committee to vote 
“Ought to Pass” on LD 1902, An Act to Protect Personal Health Data. Thank you for your 
consideration.
