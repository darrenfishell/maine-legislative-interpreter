 TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 741  
 
AN ACT TO PROHIBIT T RAINING REPAYMENT  
AGREEMENTS BY EMPLOY ERS 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine School Boards 
Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine School 
Boards Association in opposition to L.D. 741.  
 
Our association is opposed to this bill because collective bargaining agreements 
often include language related to course work and training approval with payment 
for or reimbursement for the training. This language is understood and agreed to 
by both employer and employee within these bargaining units.   
 
Additionally, school districts, with public dollars being expended, create an expec-
tation that there will be a return on their investment of supporting the training re-
ceived by the employees. An example might be of an administrator receiving reim-
bursement for course work for an advanced degree with the expectation that the 
person work in the district for a specified amount of time. Another example might 
be a bus driver candidate, having their training provided by a district, only to jump 
ship after getting the bus driver license because a neighboring district pays a sign-
ing bonus and higher hourly wage.   
 
Removing the repayment agreement could be seen as creating open season on re-
cruiting and hiring, without any loyalty to the district that provides the training. 
Any agreement would still be determined at the local level.   
 
MSBA urges the Committee on Labor and Housing to not pass L.D. 741.
