LD 319 
Senator Brenner 
Representative Gramlich 
Members of the Energy & Natural Resources Committee 
My name is Jonathan Mapes and I am here to support LD 319. I have been before 
this committee for an appointment to the BEP where I served for 4 years. The 
Sanford School committee was also one of my favorite volunteer activities for9 
years. 
Our family business which started in 1936 in Springvale, Maine owns 12 
convenience stores all with UST's of varying ages. We also supply 60 independent 
store owners with gasoline and diesel in many Maine towns. 
LD 319 offers a sound business approach to l\/laine business owners. 
Both our industry and the l\/laine Dep have made significant technological and 
professional advances since the inception of Chapter 691. l'd like to thank the 
DEP for our mutually cordial understanding. That was not the case in the early 
years. 
Sufficient data exists that UST's last longer than the 30 years currently set as the 
mandatory replacement timefra me. 
If a tank did fail, the manufacturers 30 year warranty offers little to no support to 
the tank owner. To prove the failure is that of the MFG, the owner needs to pay 
for the removal so as to set the UST on the surface for the MFG to inspect. 
Independent store owners are most at risk; which has the potential to leave some 
Maine communities with few if any fueling sites. If that occurs Maine will havea 
high percentage of out of state store/fueling owner-operators. 
UST owners are required to do an annual site inspection of all tank components 
as well as a 3 year inspection by a licensed 3'â€œ party per EPA rules.
