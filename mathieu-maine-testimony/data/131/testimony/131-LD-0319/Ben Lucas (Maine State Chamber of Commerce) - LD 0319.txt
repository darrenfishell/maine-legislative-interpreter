RE: MSCC Testimony in Support of L.D. 319: An Act to Amend Maine's Undergrozmd Oil Storage Tank Laws 
Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee: 
My name is Ben Lucas, I live in Portland, and I represent the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, a statewide business 
organization consisting of a network of more than 5,000 small and large employers across Maine. The Maine State 
Chamber of Commerce is submitting this testimony in support of L.D. 319. 
We believe L.D. 319 would be a great improvement to Chapter 691 and would be meaningful to the industry as well as 
consumers. We also believe that this is a sensible improvement which keeps the safety of these tanks front in center, but 
also helps our small businesses in Maine. 
Under current Maine law, upon the expiration date of a manufacturer's warranty on underground oil storage tanks, the 
tank and its associated piping must be removed from service and properly abandoned, except that a double—walled 
underground oil storage tank may continue in service up to 10 years beyond the expiration of the warranty if certain 
testing is conducted to verify the integrity of the tank. This bill removes the 10-year limitation, thereby allowing such 
double-walled tanks to continue in service indefinitely if the same testing requirements are satisfied. This would be 
beneficial to many Maine businesses and a huge cost savings. Replacing these tanks so often is a large expense to Maine 
businesses and in some cases outweigh the profit margins, thus resulting in business closure when it comes time to replace 
the tank. Currently, Maine is one of the only states in New England that has a law like this, and we believe this would bea 
positive change to help us stay competitive with the rest of the New England states. 
We encourage the committee vote ought to pass on LD 319. Thank you and I will be available for the work session. 
Sincerely, 
Benjamin R. Lucas 
Senior Government Relations Specialist 
Maine State Chamber of Commerce
