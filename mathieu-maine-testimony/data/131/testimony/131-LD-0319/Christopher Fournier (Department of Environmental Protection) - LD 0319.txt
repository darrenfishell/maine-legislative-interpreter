SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF L.D. 319 
AN ACT TO AMEND MAINE’S UNDERGROUND OIL STORAGE TANK LAWS 
SPONSORED BY SENATOR JEFFERY TIMBERLAKE 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
DATE OF HEARING: 
FEBRUARY 15, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Chris 
Fournier, Director of the Division of Petroleum Management at the Department of 
Environmental Protection. I am speaking in support of L.D. 319. 
Maine’s underground oil storage tank program is responsible for protecting public health 
and the environment, by preventing oil discharges from underground oil storage tank 
facilities. The program is administered by the Department and has been reviewed and 
approved by USEPA to meet all federal requirements. Maine currently has over 2000 
active underground oil storage tanks used to store motor fuels or used in the marketing 
and distribution of oil at approximately 1200 facilities. 
Under current law, upon the expiration date of a manufacturer's warranty the tank and 
its associated piping must be removed from service and properly abandoned. The

manufacturer ’s warranty is typically 30 years for these types of underground oil storage 
tanks. The law provides an exception whereby a double-walled underground oil storage 
tank may qualify for a one-time extension and continue in service forup to 10 years 
beyond the expiration of the warranty. This bill removes the 10-year limitation, thereby 
allowing such double-walled tanks to continue in sen/ice indefinitely as long certain 
requirements are satisﬁed. 
The speciﬁc requirements that currently need to be met in order for a tank to be eligible 
for an extension can be found in Maine's Rule For Underground Oi! Storage Facilities 
06-096 C.M.R. ch 691 § 5(F) (last amended September~26, 2018). These requirements 
typically include upgrading the facility piping, leak detection, spill prevention and overﬁll 
protection components to comply with current standards. They also include meeting the 
annual inspection and certain integrity testing schedules. Meeting these upgrade 
requirements.can cost a facility owner, around $30,000 to $40,000 for the average small 
facility. Current law would allow this investment to provide -the facility owner witha 
maximum of an additional 10 years of operational life for their tank. L.D. 319 would 
allow facility owners undertaking these upgrades to get a better return on their 
investment. 
All current underground oil storage tanks used to store motor fuels or used in the 
marketing and distribution of oil in Maine are double-walled with continuous monitoring 
of the interstitial space. This requirement went into place in September of 1991. This 
means that for a properly operated and maintained system, a failure of either the 
primary or secondary tank wall should be identiﬁed and able to be addressed well 
before there is an opportunity for any product to be released to the environment. A 
review of Department records for the past 5 years supports this. There were 24 
reported failures of double-walled tanks during that time representing approximately 1% 
of the over 2000 active tanks in Maine. None of those failures resulted in a breach of 
both tank walls or a release of product to the environment. The structural issues were 
caught before there was a release from the tank because of a combination of the

interstitial monitoring, the annual inspections and lor integrity testing requirements of 
06-096 C.M.R. ch 691 conducted by a licensed underground tank installer or inspector. 
Currently, the most common cause of an oil discharge to the environment froma 
double-walled underground oil storage tank facility is not a problem with the tank itself 
but typically the result of delivery errors or problems found with the older piping or at the 
dispensers. These are the areas that 06-096 C.M.R. ch 691 requires to be addressed 
before the facility can qualify for an extension. 
ln the next ﬁve years, over 1/3 of Maine’s underground oil storage facilities will have 
tanks impacted by the warranty expiration removal deadline. If those facilities follow 
recent trends, only approximately 20% are likely to conduct the removal and choose to 
install replacement underground tanks. The expense associated with removing and 
replacing an underground oil storage facility can cost well over $200,000. As such 
almost half will choose to apply for the 10-year extension and the remaining 30% will 
likely choose not to install replacement underground tanks at all. 
In closing, enactment of L.D. 319 would provide those owners interested in pursuing an 
extension of their underground oil storage tank’s lifespan with an opportunity to geta 
better return on their investment. Removing the 10-year limitation currently placed on 
these extensions would provide an incentive for more of these facilities to conduct the 
required upgrades and stay in operation where they may not have othen/vise been able 
to afford the cost of a full tank system replacement. With the requirements already put in 
place by 06-096 C.M.R. ch. 691, the changes proposed by L.D. 319 would not 
negatively impact the underground oil storage tank program’s ability to prevent oil 
discharges from underground oil storage tank facilities or protect public health and the 
environment. I ask your support of L.D. 319 and I would be happy to answer any 
questions you have, now, or at the work session. 
Thank you.
