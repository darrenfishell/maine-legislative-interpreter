TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
CONSERVATION AND FORESTRY 
IN OPPOSITION TO LD 562 
An Act to Ensure Maine Residents Have Priority Access to State Park Campsites 
February 27, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Andy Cutko, and I am the Director of the 
Bureau of Parks and Lands in the Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry. I’m 
speaking on behalf of the Department in opposition to LD 562, An Act to Ensure Maine 
Residents Have Priority Access to State Park Campsites. 
LD 5 62 aims to allow Maine residents, and only Maine residents, the ability to reserve a State 
Park campsite on the opening day of reservations. The intent of this bill is understandable, and 
we receive this suggestion almost every year. However, the suggested policy change would bea 
clear violation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act. The LWCF is a federal 
funding source that has assisted in the acquisition and/or maintenance of each of our l2 State 
Park campgrounds. The Prohibition of Discrimination section of the LWCF Act states that 
“discrimination based on residence, including preferential reservation, memberships, or amiual 
permit systems, is prohibited except to the extent that reasonable differences in admission and 
other fees may be maintained based on residence. ” 
The Bureau receives approximately $2.5 million from LWCF each year, and the majority of 
those ftmds are granted to municipalities for recreational purposes, including ball ﬁelds and town 
parks. Passage of this legislation would put this important ﬁmding in jeopardy as it is tied 
directly to the funding the Department receives from LWCF for State Parks. 
Thank you for your time. I would happily answer any questions now or at the work session.
