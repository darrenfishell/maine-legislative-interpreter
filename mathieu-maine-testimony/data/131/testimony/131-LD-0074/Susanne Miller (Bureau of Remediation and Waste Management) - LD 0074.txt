AN ACT TO UPDATE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CLEAN-UP AND

SPONSORED BY SENATOR ANNE CARNEY 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
DATE OF HEARING: 
JANUARY 30, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am 
Susanne Miller, Director of the Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management at the 
Department of Environmental Protection. I am speaking in support of L.D. 74. 
The Department administers the Maine Ground and Surface Waters Clean-up and 
Response Fund as an important resource to provide for the prompt and effective 
cleanup of petroleum releases and compensation for third-party damages resulting from 
those releases. The Fund is approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as 
an acceptable mechanism for Maine’s underground storage tank owners to meet the 
federal financial responsibility requirements, and it is used by a majority of Maine's tank 
owners for that purpose.

L.D. 74 - An Act to Update the Responsibilities of the Clean-up and Response Review Board 
Testimony of: Susanne Miller - DEP 
Public Hearing: 1/30/2023 
Page 2 of3 
The Clean-up and Response Fund Review Board was created to monitor income and 
disbursements from the Fund and to adjust oil import fees as required to avoida 
shortfall in the Fund. The Review Board reviews Department priorities for 
disbursements from the Fund and makes recommendations to the Commissioner on 
how the Fund should be allocated. The Review Board is also tasked with hearing 
appeals of any Fund insurance claims-related decisions made by the Department 
Commissioner or the State Fire Marshal in accordance with Maine Revised Statutes, 
Title 38, Section 568-A. 
Due to the number vacancies in critical board seats, the Clean-up and Response Fund 
Review Board has not been able to meet since 2018. The Department has hada 
difficult time finding and keeping qualified volunteers to fill the seats that have been 
vacated as members have retired or resigned from the Board. This has made it difficult 
to keep the Board functioning efficiently and has negatively impacted the ability to 
process appeals of Insurance claims-related decisions in a timely manner. There are 
three Fund coverage appeals that have been waiting for a hearing with the Review 
Board since 2020. All necessary spill clean-up has occurred at these sites, but the 
Department has been unable to collect the assigned Fund deductibles or proceed with 
cost recovery while an appeal is pending. 
L.D. 74 makes several changes to the statute that will ensure that there is a process for 
appeals to be heard in a timely manner. The bill does this by removing the 
responsibility for hearing and deciding appeals of Fund insurance claims-related 
decisions under section 568-A from the Clean-up and Response Fund Review Board 
and placing that responsibility with the Board of Environmental Protection. The Board of 
Environmental Protection typically meets twice a month to conduct business and has 
not had the same issues regarding the filling of vacant seats. The Board of 
Environmental Protection already has the responsibility for hearing appeals of final 
license or permit decisions made by the Department Commissioner, and this bill would
L.D. 74 - An Act to Update the Responsibilities of the Clean-up and Response Review Board Testimony of: Susanne Miller - DEP

add appeals of Fund insurance claims-related decisions under section 568-A to that 
responsibility. 
L.D. 74 makes other changes to improve the ability of the Review Board to function 
more effectively in its advisory role. Section 8 of the bill would help reduce the length of 
Review Board seat vacancies by allowing appointed members to continue to serve in 
their current capacity for up to a year after the member’s term expires. The member 
can continue to sen/e in their originally appointed role while waiting to be reappointed or 
for a successor to be appointed. 
In closing, enactment of L.D. 74 will provide a more effective means of processing 
appeals of Fund insurance claims-related decisions under section 568-A made by the 
Department Commissioner or the State Fire Marshal. It will ensure that any appeals that 
are filed are heard in a timely manner. it also makes updates that improve the ability of 
the Review Board to continue to function more effectively by reducing the length of time 
a seat is vacant. I ask your support of L.D. 74 and l would be happy to answer any 
questions you have, now, or at the work session. 
Thank you.
