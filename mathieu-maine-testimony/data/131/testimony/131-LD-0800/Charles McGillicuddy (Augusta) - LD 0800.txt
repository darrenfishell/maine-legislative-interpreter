Testimony on LD 800' 
before the Transportation Committee of the Maine Legislature, 
presented .on March 23, 2023 
by Charles McGillicuddy of Augusta, Maine 
I am here to speak in support of LD 800 introduced by Raegan LaRochelle. This bill would remove hitchhiking at night from the list of violations. 
Currently Title 29A - Motor Vehicles and Trafﬁc, Chapter 19: Operation, 
Subchapter 2: Violations, has in Paragraph 2110 -- Hitchhiking forbidden, which states that it is a violation to hitchhike on any portion of a public Way during the nighttime. Included -please ﬁnd the full text of Paragraph 2110. 
As part of an effort to limit the consumption of gas and oil, ridesharing ought to be encouraged to lessen the impact on climate change and to improve the economy of the state. Maine does not have a robustpublic transportation systemand for-those in rural areas travel for work or shopping or medical care is thereby limited. For those with limited means, including some of our veterans, that places an -additional 
burden on their access to resources. In the winter in Maine nighttime is longer than 14 hours. 
Here in Augusta Post 887 ,-of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United_States has approved a motion to support this bill. 
In Cuba drivers of government vehicles are encouraged topick up passengers if it 
will not impede ofﬁcial government business. In the Netherlands there are 
hitchhiking pick up spots with appropriate signage. Cities with HOV lanes are 
ﬁnding that drivers are eager to pick up passengers to have access to the HOV lane. A research study in California showed that hitchhiking is far less dangerous than the -pu~blic ‘perception. https ://travelhowto. com/is-hitchi1g_ng-dangerous-=us/ ’ 
I urge the Committee to sup-port this bill as a means of accomplishing the thither 
provision of resources to those in need and granting fairness to the citizens of the state of Maine.
