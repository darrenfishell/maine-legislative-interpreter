To the Agriculture Committee:
Please accept this letter in support of LD 1670 - An Act to Strengthen Maine's 
Agriculture, Food and Forest Economy by Funding the Maine Agriculture, Food and 
Forest Products Investment Fund and Amending Related Provisions of Law.
My name is Laura Flannery.  I own an operate Blue Ox Blueberries, a 140 acre 
certified-organic wild blueberry farm located in Charlotte (eastern Washington 
County).  Iâ€™m a first generation farmer who got my start in 2012.  Building a farm 
business from scratch has been quite a challenge.  
Despite successful harvests and lucrative direct marketing, we have struggled to make
infrastructure and equipment investments to help us meet the growing demand for 
organic Maine wild blueberries.  Last year, we were awarded funding through the 
AIIP grant and it has been completely life changing.  We were able to invest in new 
harvesters and processing equipment that will allow us to more than double our 
current capacity and help meet the ever-growing demand for organic Maine wild 
blueberries.  
Out of the hundreds of Maine farms that applied for the AIIP Grant, only 84 were 
awarded funding.  There is still huge need amongst Maine farmers.  We must make an
AIIP-style grant permanent to support the hardworking small farms of Maine.  The 
grant should be simple, straightforward, and geared specifically for farms, not larger 
processing companies.  
Thank you,
Laura Flannery
