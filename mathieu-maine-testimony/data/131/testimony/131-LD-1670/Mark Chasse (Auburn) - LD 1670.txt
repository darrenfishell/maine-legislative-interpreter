LD 1670 ought-NOT-to pass as as on many public private partnerships, the 
government tends to add "strings" to it's side of the partnership thereby imparting 
their political views and subsequent coercive mandates and essentially taking over the
business. Maine should not embark in this venture.
Thank you.
