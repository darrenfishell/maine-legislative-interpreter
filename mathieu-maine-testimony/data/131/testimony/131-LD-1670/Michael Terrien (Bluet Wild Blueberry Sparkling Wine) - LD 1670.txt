AIIP funds awarded to BLUET Maine Wild Blueberry Sparkling Wine are designated
for hauling berries, fermenting juice and improving quality in our mission to develop 
a new value-added product for Maine's wild blueberry farmers.  Collaboration 
between growers and wineries is key to our mission and the application process in 
2022 focused our mutual interests.
Continuing the funding of AIIP specifically for growers and producers will support 
the challenging and necessary development of alternative value-added products. For 
our emerging wine sector, each of the awardees in our ad-hoc coalition are 
meaningfully impacted by the infusion of grant-capital which provides security for 
engaging in this creative work. Ongoing funding opportunities through this very 
straightforward application process will help to stabilize the future of Maine's small 
wild blueberry family farms.
I cannot overstate the direct impact on our business of AIIP. I know the same is true 
for the others with whom we collaborate. Directing funds to the folks who work the 
fields is most important for sustaining agriculture and bolstering rural economies 
while supporting value-added product creators is an investment in expansion.
