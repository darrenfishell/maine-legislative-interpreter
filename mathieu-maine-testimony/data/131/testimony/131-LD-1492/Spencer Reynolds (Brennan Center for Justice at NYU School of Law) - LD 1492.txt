1 Brennan Center for Justice at New Y ork University School of LawFor almost two decades, the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) has supported the  
development of a national network of 80 fusion 
centers. Operated by states and localities, fusion centers 
incorporate federal, state, and local law enforcement 
personnel, first responders, and select private-sector 
representatives to collect, analyze, and distribute intelli-
gence. While the federal government initially promoted 
them as hubs for sharing counterterrorism information, 
fusion centers quickly expanded their missions to include 
any crimes or hazards. 
DHS provides these centers with funding, personnel, 
and access to federal intelligence, but it has failed to 
ensure that they have used these resources appropriately. 
As a result, fusion centers have long produced flawed 
analysis, abused their authorities to monitor people 
engaged in First Amendment–protected activities, and 
leaked sensitive law enforcement information. This 
domestic intelligence model has undermined Americans’ 
privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. 
Fusion centers have repeatedly targeted minority 
communities and protest movements under the guise of 
counterterrorism or public safety. In their early years, they often singled out American Muslims for unwarranted 
scrutiny. Their bulletins have regularly painted racial and 
environmental justice activists as menacing threats. 
Fusion center reports are widely disseminated to local 
police and federal law enforcement, likely contributing to 
their heavy-handed responses to these protests in recent 
years. The participation of private companies, including 
some that have been the subjects of protests, in fusion 
centers raises the possibility that these operations some-
times serve private interests rather than public safety.
Fusion centers continue to be susceptible to abuse as 
protest movements react to events, creating new targets 
for unwarranted scrutiny. For example, fusion centers 
have amplified FBI and DHS threat warnings that falsely 
lump pro-choice activists together with abortion foes as 
potential “abortion-related violent extremists,” even 
though only anti-abortion militants have a history of 
engaging in deadly violence.1 As states criminalize abor -
tion, investigations of those seeking, providing, or even 
just supporting access to reproductive services will fit 
within fusion centers’ “all crimes” remit,2 making it likely 
that fusion centers will heed law enforcement requests 
for assistance.DHS AT 20: AN AGENDA FOR REFORM
Ending Fusion 
Center Abuses
A Roadmap for Robust Federal Oversight

2 Brennan Center for Justice Ending Fusion Center Abusescollection mechanism feeding the federal intelligence 
community with information gathered from every Amer -
ican neighborhood. The network operates in secret, with -
out a clear charter, and under ambiguous lines of 
authority. It includes not only federal, state, and local law 
enforcement, but also other public and private entities 
that have no authority to collect or disseminate intelli -
gence about Americans. The public has little access to 
information regarding what their local fusion centers do 
in their communities or even who works there. No federal 
entity accepts responsibility for overseeing them, leaving 
the network essentially ungoverned.
Expanding Missions
The federal government supported the development of the 
national network as a means for sharing counterterrorism 
information between federal law enforcement, military, 
and intelligence agencies; state and local law enforcement 
and emergency response services; and select private-sector 
entities. Most fusion centers were established in the decade 
following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the theory that gath-
ering information from a multitude of sources and sharing 
it broadly would help law enforcement and intelligence 
agencies predict and prevent terrorist attacks.4
Operated mainly by state and local governments, fusion 
centers receive substantial support from the federal govern -
ment in the form of DHS and Department of Justice (DOJ) 
grant funding, access to federal counterterrorism and mili-
tary intelligence data systems, and personnel deployed from 
DHS and the FBI.5 They are staffed primarily by state and 
local law enforcement, but also include representatives from 
emergency management and public health agencies, the 
National Guard, and locally chosen private-sector partici -
pants and contractors.6 DHS began serving as the primary 
federal liaison to fusion centers in 2007.7 
To encourage greater participation by entities that did 
not feel their local terrorism threat justified their involve-
ment, fusion centers quickly expanded the purposes of 
their intelligence collection activities, first to “all crimes” 
and then, as they recruited more non–law enforcement 
agencies and private-sector participants, to “all hazards.”8 
This shift is reflected in their mission statements, which 
often make no mention of terrorism but instead are expan -
sive enough to encompass nearly any activity the fusion 
center chooses to undertake.9 Such a broad remit makes it 
difficult for fusion centers to develop reliable metrics to 
measure their effectiveness and all but impossible for over -
seers to determine whether a fusion center’s actions are 
necessary or appropriate.
The funding model has changed as well. Initially devel-
oped with federal dollars, fusion centers are now mainly 
supported through state and local budgets. According to 
the most recent data published by DHS, in 2017, fusion 
centers received about a third of their funding from federal 
grants.10 Federal auditors have complained, however, that At the same time, there is little to suggest that fusion 
centers have provided meaningful assistance to federal 
counterterrorism efforts. And even as they have broad -
ened their missions beyond counterterrorism, there is no 
evidence that they have contributed substantially to 
reducing or solving serious crime. They do, however, facil -
itate broad, unregulated information sharing among a 
variety of public and private entities with little oversight 
or public accountability, which poses a serious security 
liability that was realized when hackers breached a fusion 
center contractor in 2020, exposing hundreds of thou -
sands of sensitive records from the FBI, DHS, and other 
law enforcement agencies. 
As the 20th anniversary of the creation of DHS 
approaches, the Brennan Center has undertaken a compre -
hensive review of the department’s efforts to carry out its 
primary mission of keeping the country safe from terror -
ism. Our April 2022 report, A Course Correction for Home-
land Security: Curbing Counterterrorism Abuses, identified 
structural and operational problems endemic to DHS-  
sponsored fusion centers.3 This report expands on these 
critiques and proposes solutions through the lens of federal 
funding, support, and oversight. While fusion centers are 
run by state or local agencies, they continue to receive 
significant federal investments. The federal government 
has an obligation to guard against the misuse of the 
resources, systems, and personnel it provides, and to 
ensure that Americans’ constitutional rights are not 
infringed upon by the improper collection, retention, and 
dissemination of personally identifiable information of 
persons not reasonably suspected of criminal activity. 
Accordingly, the secretary of homeland security should 
take immediate action to ensure that DHS grants to fusion 
centers are transparent and used for their intended counter  - 
terrorism purpose. The secretary should also require regu-
lar audits of fusion centers to ensure that data is protected 
against unauthorized disclosure, and that DHS resources 
are not used in violation of constitutional rights. Congress 
should establish a special inspector general to audit the 
national network of fusion centers to detect waste, fraud, 
abuse, and illegality, and should use the results of this audit 
to establish a permanent, independent federal oversight 
body to ensure that future violations of any laws, regula-
tions, or policies are discovered and remedied in a timely 
manner. These reforms will help to ensure that fusion 
centers’ capabilities and resources are not abused, and that 
Americans’ rights to freedom of speech and association 
are preserved.
Mission Versus Reality 
No single piece of legislation established the national  
network of fusion centers, defined its mission, or autho-
rized it to operate as a decentralized domestic intelligence 
3 Brennan Center for Justice Ending Fusion Center AbusesThe bulletins, which were sent to some 14,000 police 
officers, did not include any specific threat information, 
but nevertheless painted the rallies as dangerous,  
stating that “[s]ome of these events involve criminal 
activities such as planned looting, vandalism and 
threats of violence.”17
	The Austin, Texas, fusion center combed social media 
for announcements of events hosted by Black Lives 
Matter organizers, creating intelligence reports about 
events as innocuous as a Juneteenth celebration, a medi -
tation circle, and candlelight vigils for victims of police 
violence. It shared these reports with local, state, and 
federal law enforcement agencies, as well as with the 
Central Intelligence Agency and Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement.18
	The Maine fusion center tracked racial justice protests 
and disseminated online conspiracy theories and disin -
formation exaggerating the potential for violence at 
demonstrations.19 For example, the center sent out alerts 
from DHS and the FBI in June 2020 warning police 
departments that piles of bricks were being placed 
around the country, which the source for the report 
claimed was a “tactic . . . used by Antifa to fuel violent 
opportunists.”20 The source was a far-right social media 
account that disseminated pro-Trump conspiracy theo -
ries.21 In another alert, the fusion center warned that a 
TikTok video posted by a teenager, consisting entirely 
of other people’s tweets, provided “tactics, techniques 
and procedures on how to interfere with the US National 
Guard during riots.”22 
	The national fusion center network distributed false threat 
warnings regarding “antifa arsonists” starting wildfires 
in the western United States and “anarchist extremists” 
planning an “International Sabotage Day.”23 These warn -
ings proliferated through the network despite some inter -
nal efforts to debunk them, misdirecting scarce law 
enforcement and emergency response resources during 
natural disasters.24
Environmental advocacy groups, such as those seeking 
to block the construction of pipelines over Native Amer -
ican lands, are often the targets of fusion center scrutiny 
as well. According to a lawsuit filed by activists and orga -
nizers in Oregon, the state’s fusion center has, “for years, 
engaged in and facilitated the surveillance of environmen -
tal advocacy groups, community organizations, and 
Native American tribes opposing the proposed $10 billion 
fossil fuel pipeline and export terminal known as Jordan 
Cove LNG.”25 In emails obtained by the Guardian  in 2019, 
the local sheriff’s office reported tracking attendance at 
a rally for the fusion center “as promised,” despite a “lack 
of criminal nexus.”26 Fusion center analysts also submitted the way DHS and DOJ grants are distributed to law enforce -
ment makes it difficult to determine how much federal 
funding fusion centers actually receive and how they use it.11
There is also no publicly available information detailing 
how fusion centers allocate their spending between coun -
terterrorism, general crimes, and hazards. In a 2017 DHS 
survey, 94 percent of fusion centers said that counterter -
rorism was among their top five priorities, with general 
crime, narcotics, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure 
rounding out the list.12 According to that same report, 
however, only 16 percent of fusion center analysts are 
counterterrorism specialists, which suggests that coun-
terterrorism is a relatively smaller part of their work.13 
Cracking Down on Dissent
The blurry boundaries and shifting contours of their 
missions have given fusion centers ample room to abuse 
their authorities. Over the last two decades, leaked materi-
als have shown fusion centers tracking protestors and cast -
ing peaceful activities as potential threats. Their targets have 
included racial justice and environmental advocates, right-
wing activists, and third-party political candidates.14
In 2020, fusion centers regularly tracked the overwhelm -
ingly nonviolent racial justice protests organized across the 
country in response to the police killings of George Floyd 
and Breonna Taylor. Though violence and property damage 
did occur amid some protests, fusion centers issued bulle -
tins that were poorly sourced, sensationalized, and unable 
to point to specific threat information. These bulletins — 
often citing rumors or disinformation spread by anony -
mous social media posters or right-wing media sites — rarely 
identified individuals suspected of specific criminal activ -
ities. Rather, they routinely insinuated that the protestors 
were collectively responsible for any crimes committed 
during demonstrations and broadly labeled them as anar -
chists or “antifa” (shorthand for anti-fascists), echoing 
language that President Donald Trump used to demonize 
protesters.15 Press reports and leaked documents reveal 
how fusion centers around the country hyped the threat 
posed by protesters:
	The Minnesota fusion center “fed a constant stream of 
unverified and ultimately bogus threats to officers” 
during the unrest in Minneapolis, according to the 
Minnesota Reformer, “while failing to identify more cred -
ible risks.” For example, the center modified information 
from an FBI report documenting a source’s warning of 
a possible “Antifa” car bomb attack against the National 
Guard, removing language reflecting the analyst’s skep -
ticism regarding its credibility and painting the threat 
as definitive rather than speculative.16  No such attack 
took place.
	The Northern California fusion center issued multiple 
warnings about Black Lives Matter rallies in the region.

owners who interrupted a 2018 chamber of commerce 
meeting to censure the chamber for accepting donations 
from an oil company.27
The North Dakota fusion center played a similar role in 
collecting and disseminating intelligence about protestors 
challenging the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline 
in 2016. The center issued threat assessments based on 
information compiled from state and local police and 
social media, flagging citizen journalism organizations and 
advocates for Native American communities as “groups of 
interest.”28 The overwhelming majority of information 
described nonviolent demonstrations with no link to crim -
inal activity. Private Priorities
>> Fusion center monitoring of environmental protests 
demonstrates the risks of private-sector participation in 
these ventures. In theory, private partners could provide 
useful counterterrorism information to the government 
or use information provided by the government to 
mitigate threats. In practice, their participation can 
distort fusion centers’ public safety mission in service of 
corporate interests. According to the Oregon environ-
mental activists’ lawsuit, the state fusion center 
“facilitated the creation of, and worked closely alongside, 
a taskforce that included a dedicated unit” within the 
sheriff’s office that was “funded entirely by Pembina, the 
private fossil fuel company” that was seeking to build the 
pipeline.29 The Oregon fusion center also “cooperated 
and coordinated” with “a private public relations firm 
retained by Pembina to monitor opposition to the project 
and turn public sentiment against the organizations and 
individuals opposing [the pipeline]. ”30 
Similarly, the law enforcement response to the 2016 
Dakota Access Pipeline protests — which was marked by 
excessive, indiscriminate police violence and mass 
arrests — was coordinated through a task force that 
included not only the North Dakota fusion center and 
federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies but 
also TigerSwan, an unlicensed private security contrac-
tor with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan that was 
working for the pipeline company.31 TigerSwan opera-
tives infiltrated protest groups and developed detailed 
dossiers on individual protestors.32 It shared sensational-
ized threat reports with law enforcement, labeling the 
pipeline protests an “insurgency” that needed to be 
defeated, and often highlighted the presence of Palestin-
ian Americans and other “Islamic individuals” in the 
protestors’ camp to suggest that Middle Eastern terrorist 
groups may have been working with the protesters.33
These are not isolated events. Fusion centers in 
Oklahoma, T exas, and Nebraska have had similar 
intelligence-sharing arrangements with fossil fuel 
companies focused on monitoring and subverting 
environmental activists’ protest activities.34Early signs suggest that fusion centers and law enforce-
ment may similarly overreact to pro-choice protestors as 
they mobilize on the streets and on social media in the wake 
of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization.35 A Virginia fusion center 
report, for instance, observed that “groups from both sides 
of the issue” were organizing protests following the May 
2022 leak of the draft Dobbs opinion and warned that 
“some may become violent,” without clarifying that 
anti-abortion extremists have committed the vast majority 
of abortion-related violence.36 Fusion center publications 
touting a speculative threat from pro-choice activists run 
the risk of magnifying a law enforcement response by 
agents already poised to provoke violence against protesters. 
After the Dobbs decision leaked, for example, DHS Federal 
Protective Service officers in Los Angeles instigated a hostile 
confrontation with protesters at an orderly reproductive 
rights demonstration blocks away from the federal court-
house where they have jurisdiction.37
Moreover, police in states that criminalize abortion are 
likely to leverage their fusion centers’ access to a broad array 
of data, including federal counterterrorism systems, to 
gather evidence and intelligence necessary to enforce these 
anti-abortion laws. Since fusion centers operate in a national 
network, personnel in states where abortion remains legal 
may be tasked with assisting out-of-state criminal investi-
gations seeking to develop evidence for abortion-related 
prosecutions.38 
Fusion centers are not alone in targeting protestors and 
minority communities. The FBI, DHS, and police depart -
ments have done the same. But fusion centers facilitate and 
amplify this abuse because, as detailed in the next section, 
they are designed to enable the unfettered collection and 
broad dissemination of information about the activities of 
Americans who are not suspected of any criminal activity. 
5 Brennan Center for Justice Ending Fusion Center Abuses	Law Enforcement Online (LEO) is managed by the FBI 
to provide a secure means to communicate and share 
unclassified (though potentially sensitive) information.44 
Users can upload all types of personally identifiable 
information, including financial data and medical histo -
ries, as well as individuals’ “photos, all types of physical 
characteristics, and activities.”45 As of 2012, the service 
had almost 60,000 active users from criminal justice 
agencies, the intelligence community, the military, 
agencies charged with protecting critical infrastructure, 
and select private-sector representatives.46 
	The National Data Exchange (N-DEx), also managed by 
the FBI, is an online investigative information-sharing 
system with more than 90,000 registered users from 
criminal justice agencies at all levels of government as 
well some private security agencies, such as railroad and 
campus police.47 As of 2015, N-DEx reportedly held over 
180 million records relating to 1 billion people, places, 
and events.48 In addition to information about people 
convicted or suspected of crimes, the database contains 
information about witnesses and “anyone else who may 
be identified in criminal justice information.”49 
	The Regional Intelligence Sharing Systems (RISS) 
program is a DOJ-funded “family” of six regional intelli-
gence systems that are meant to support law enforcement 
efforts against all types of crimes.50 Its 157,000 authorized 
users are from law enforcement and criminal justice 
agencies. The system provides intelligence analysis, digi -
tal forensics, and audio/video enhancement and allows 
access to specialized investigative databases.51 
	The Law Enforcement Information Exchange (LInX), 
created by the U.S. Navy’s civilian law enforcement 
component, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, 
is used by some 2,000 law enforcement agencies.52 In 
addition to criminal incident data such as arrests and 
outstanding warrants, LInX includes noncriminal infor -
mation, such as data from field interviews, traffic stops, 
parking tickets, and automated license plate readers.53 
As of 2015, this data warehouse reportedly contained 
over 570 million event records.54 
RISS, N-DEx, and LInX operate under a federal regulation 
— discussed in further detail below — that prohibits 
criminal intelligence systems from collecting, maintain-
ing, or disseminating intelligence about individuals 
unless there is “reasonable suspicion that the individual 
is involved in criminal conduct or activity and the infor -
mation is relevant to that criminal conduct or activity.”55 
The regulation restricts access to information for official 
law enforcement purposes and requires users to seek 
permission from the providing agency before using any 
data in an affidavit or criminal proceeding. Data Systems Ripe  
for Exploitation
Fusion center personnel have access to vast government 
and private-sector data systems and information-sharing 
platforms. How they use these systems is shielded from 
public view. Fusion center proponents at DHS and DOJ 
diluted or subverted long-standing restraints on law 
enforcement intelligence collection as part of their efforts 
to establish fusion centers as local intelligence hubs and 
combine them into a national network. The effect was to 
create an enormous and unaccountable domestic intelli -
gence enterprise that now operates in every U.S. commu -
nity, threatening Americans’ privacy and fundamental 
freedoms without justification, proper legal process, or 
independent oversight.
Access to Expansive Information Sources
Fusion center personnel have access to massive amounts 
of data about the activities of ordinary Americans not 
suspected of criminal activities. In addition to the infor -
mation systems and databases owned and controlled by 
their home agencies, fusion center participants can also 
access information from a range of other government and 
private data systems, whether directly through subscrip -
tions with data brokers or as a function of sitting next to 
a colleague with access. While some of this information 
might be useful for criminal investigations, it can all too 
easily be abused.39
Neither DHS nor the fusion center network publicly 
discloses all the data systems that fusion center person-
nel have access to, but a review of some of the most 
prominent ones gives a sense of the scope of information 
available to fusion centers:
	The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) 
was established by DHS to facilitate information  
sharing among a multitude of government agencies 
and private partners involved in “identifying and 
preventing terrorism” and “incident management  
activities,” from terrorist attacks to natural disasters.40 
According to its 2020 annual report, nearly 150,000 
people are registered to use HSIN.41 There are virtually 
no limits on the types of information that can be 
disseminated through HSIN, which may include 
personally identifiable information.42 Law enforce -
ment, emergency management agencies, and the 
National Guard used HSIN to monitor the summer 
2020 protests against police violence in the Wash -
ington, DC, area, for instance, while the Oklahoma 
fusion center leveraged the system “for real-time  
situational awareness and information sharing”  
in response to “civil unrest and protests” that     
same year.43
6 Brennan Center for Justice Ending Fusion Center Abusesson meetings rather than through these automated 
systems.62 These offline information-sharing methods 
make it even more difficult to regulate how fusion center 
personnel use information extracted from federal intelli-
gence systems. 
Many fusion centers also purchase access to data sets 
collected by private-sector data brokers like LexisNexis 
and credit reporting agencies like TransUnion,63 and have 
contracted with data analytics firms like Palantir and 
facial recognition companies such as Tygart Technology 
and Clearview AI.64 There is hardly any federal regulation 
regarding how fusion centers contract to obtain these 
types of information and use these technologies, which 
can reveal intimate details of Americans’ lives. Indeed, the 
information gathered by these brokers and firms is far 
more likely to pertain to innocent persons than to crimi-
nals.65 The federal government does not vet these contrac -
tors, who may gain access to law enforcement sources, 
methods, data requirements, and often sensitive data 
itself, adding to the fusion center network’s security 
vulnerabilities.
Without strong rules restricting improper use, indepen -
dent oversight capable of uncovering abuse, and public 
accountability, the “need to share” culture promoted by 
fusion center proponents creates unacceptable risks to 
Americans’ civil rights and civil liberties. Moreover, protect -
ing individual privacy is not just a hallmark of a free society, 
it is essential to genuine security.66 The vast rivers of infor -
mation about Americans that flow through fusion centers 
do not resolve vulnerabilities; they create new ones.Select fusion center personnel with federal security 
clearances also have access to classified systems, such as 
the Defense Department’s Secure Internet Protocol Router 
Network (SIPRNet).56 This system, which operates as the 
military’s classified internet, was the source of the 725,000 
documents that were leaked by former U.S. Army intelli -
gence analyst Chelsea Manning.57 DHS has also developed 
its own classified system, the Homeland Security Data 
Network (HSDN). Documentation suggests that as of 2014, 
access to HSDN was extended to fusion centers.58
The multiplicity of data-sharing platforms inevitably 
leads to redundancy, contributing to information overload 
that overwhelms intelligence analysis and impairs effective 
threat response.59 For instance, information from an FBI 
bulletin shared through LEO could also be shared through 
RISS, and later disseminated over HSIN in a fusion center 
report or included in an investigative report documented 
in N-DEx. 
With so many interrelated platforms, erroneous, irrele-
vant, or misleading information shared by one user can be 
accessed by thousands of others, with no opportunity or 
ability to prevent the flawed intelligence from spreading 
through these overlapping systems. Some fusion center 
leaders have disavowed any responsibility for evaluating 
the veracity of information they disseminate, with one stat -
ing, “[i]f we set as a threshold that we are going to inde-
pendently verify every piece of information that goes out, 
then we would be sharing almost no information.”60
The restrictions on access or use of data in some of these 
systems (e.g., law enforcement–restricted data in RISS, 
LInX, and N-DEx, or classified information in SIPRNet) can 
too easily be circumvented, and the fusion center architec -
ture makes the spillage of restricted or classified data to 
unauthorized persons for improper purposes more likely.61 
By placing law enforcement officials alongside non–law 
enforcement personnel and security clearance holders 
alongside uncleared partners, and tasking them with a 
common mission, fusion centers break down the tradi -
tional arm’s-length relationships between these entities 
and undermine the legal processes designed to protect 
Americans’ privacy rights. Without independent oversight 
of how fusion centers use the data they retrieve from these 
systems, abuses are likely to go undiscovered. Internal 
audits of any one platform are unlikely to detect all the ways 
that fusion centers use the information they access, since 
the various personnel have access to multiple systems. 
Furthermore, not all information shared by fusion 
centers is disseminated through these platforms. In a 2016 
survey, fusion center personnel indicated that they often 
share information through emails, phone calls, or in-per -Creating New Security Risks
>> Fusion centers have proved themselves to be  
inadequate guardians of the security of the sensitive  
information in their systems. In 2020, hacktivists exploit -
ed a security vulnerability at a fusion center contractor 
to obtain 269 gigabytes of sensitive information from 251 
different law enforcement agencies, as well as the FBI, 
DHS, and the National Guard, spanning a 24-year period 
from 1996 to 2020.67 The leaked data, dubbed “Blue-
Leaks” in the media, included personal information about 
700,000 law enforcement officers, as well as witnesses, 
victims, and suspects. It also exposed a trove of biased, 
inappropriate, and erroneous intelligence products and 
law enforcement training materials coursing through the 
fusion center network. Some of these documents reveal 
the abuses discussed in this report.
7 Brennan Center for Justice Ending Fusion Center Abuseshoped to populate with suspicious activity reports (SARs) 
received from members of the public or local law enforce -
ment and processed through fusion centers for dissemi-
nation to the federal government.74 The ISE defined SARs 
as “official documentation of observed behavior that may 
be indicative of intelligence gathering or preoperational 
planning related to terrorism, criminal [sic], or other illicit 
intention.”75 This was a broad definition in light of the 
wide variety of activities that could be perceived as 
“preoperational planning” or related to an “illicit inten -
tion.” The FBI soon established a parallel system for 
collecting these reports called eGuardian.76 Meanwhile, 
DHS publicly promoted the “If You See Something, Say 
Something” campaign and provided training to fusion 
center personnel and the public.77 
Working together, the ISE program manager, the FBI, 
and DHS implemented the Nationwide Suspicious Activ -
ity Reporting Initiative (NSI), which enlisted fusion 
centers as the primary conduit to receive SARs from the 
local level and vet them for dissemination to the ISE and 
eGuardian.78 Training materials distributed by DHS iden-
tified innocuous, commonplace activities like taking 
photographs, asking questions, and using binoculars as 
reportable behaviors.79 Several law enforcement agencies 
and fusion center leaders balked at participating in these 
initiatives, however, because the SAR standards that ISE 
and eGuardian employed did not meet the “reasonable 
suspicion” standard required by 28 C.F.R. Part 23 or, in 
many cases, their own policies.80
In an effort to coax these agencies to participate in the 
NSI, the ISE program manager amended the ISE-SAR 
functional standard to require that documents fed into 
the system be “reasonably indicative of criminal activity 
associated with terrorism.”81 This language appeared to 
be roughly equivalent to the “reasonable suspicion” 
requirement of 28 C.F.R. Part 23, particularly as the 
amended standard specifically referenced Terry.82 But in 
practice, the ISE standard was quickly undermined, as the 
FBI promoted eGuardian’s lower submission require -
ments to encourage faster growth.83 Then, Justice Depart -
ment officials quietly instructed state and local law 
enforcement to interpret the ISE’s “reasonably indicative” 
language as more permissive than the “reasonable  
suspicion” standard of 28 C.F.R. Part 23, so that ISE and 
eGuardian would harmonize in applying a weaker  
SAR standard.84
Had SARs been required to comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 
23, they also would have been subject to its prohibitions 
on the targeting of First Amendment–protected activity 
and its limits on information sharing for non–law enforce -
ment purposes. In 2013, DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and 
Civil Liberties (CRCL) recommended that fusion centers 
adopt policies “comparable in scope and effectiveness to 
28 C.F.R. Part 23” in recognition of fusion centers’ poten -
tial “infringement of First Amendment protections.”85Untethered Data Collection Standards
State and local law enforcement intelligence units have 
long abused their power to suppress labor organizing, 
hound protest movements, and intimidate political oppo-
nents.68 To curb this pattern of abuse, in 1980, the Justice 
Department established a regulation limiting the kinds of 
information that state and local law enforcement agencies 
could collect and distribute via shared criminal intelligence 
systems receiving federal funding through the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Criminal 
Intelligence Systems Operating Policies, codified at 28 
C.F.R. Part 23, prohibits participating agencies from 
collecting and maintaining information concerning indi-
viduals in the absence of reasonable suspicion that they 
are involved in criminal conduct and that the information 
is relevant to that activity. The regulation further prohibits 
participating agencies from collecting information about 
“the political, religious or social views, associations, or 
activities of any individual or any group, association, corpo -
ration, business, partnership, or other organization unless 
such information directly relates to criminal conduct or 
activity.” It also restricts access to this information to indi -
viduals who have a “need to know and a right to know the 
information in the performance of a law enforcement 
activity.” And it limits retention of information within crim -
inal intelligence systems, requiring them to purge informa -
tion after five years.69
The reasonable suspicion standard established in 28 
C.F.R. Part 23 is not particularly arduous: it is defined 
simply as facts sufficient to give a trained investigator “a 
basis to believe there is a reasonable possibility that an 
individual or organization is involved in a definable crim -
inal activity.”70 Law enforcement officers were already 
familiar with this “reasonable suspicion” standard, which 
the Supreme Court imposed in Terry v. Ohio (1968) for 
stop-and-frisks.71 State and local law enforcement 
embraced the same standard for intelligence collection 
as a means to protect against constitutional violations as 
well as to prevent the accumulation of useless, irrelevant 
information polluting their systems, and many agencies 
adopted identical requirements in their own regulations 
and policies.72 
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, however, federal officials 
sought to undermine the regulation so that fusion centers 
could collect and disseminate counterterrorism leads they 
received through the “If You See Something, Say Some-
thing” campaign. In 2008, the Justice Department 
attempted to amend 28 C.F.R. Part 23 to allow for this 
broader type of intelligence sharing. Its effort failed, 
however, in the face of opposition by civil rights groups 
and even associations representing law enforcement 
intelligence officials.73 
At the same time, the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence was developing a new federal system called 
the Information Sharing Environment (ISE), which it 
8 Brennan Center for Justice Ending Fusion Center Abusestrack its grant spending to fusion centers to determine how 
much federal money they receive and spend on 
counterterrorism.99
In sum, fusion centers have virtually unchecked access 
to vast rivers of data, which they have exploited to target 
protest movements and other disfavored groups. More -
over, as discussed below, there is little evidence that they 
have been effective in protecting the communities they 
serve from terrorism or other serious crime.
Unimpressive Results
Fusion centers’ contributions to combating terrorism 
have  been scant. The 2012 Senate study criticized fusion 
centers for wasting counterterrorism resources and 
infringing on civil liberties. The committee staff reviewed 
more than 80,000 pages of intelligence reports, emails, 
and audits; undertook a nationwide survey of fusion 
centers; and interviewed dozens of DHS staff and local and 
state officials.100 The final report concluded that the intel-
ligence produced by DHS officers deployed to fusion 
centers was “oftentimes shoddy, rarely timely, sometimes 
endangering citizens’ civil liberties and Privacy Act protec -
tions, occasionally taken from already-published public 
sources, and more often than not unrelated to terrorism.”101 
It found that DHS support for fusion centers “yielded little, 
if any, benefit to Federal counterterrorism intelligence 
efforts.”102 Furthermore, DHS failed to illustrate a single 
“clear example in which a fusion center provided intelli -
gence which helped disrupt a terrorist plot.”103
In the decade since, DHS has made few efforts to 
address the criticisms in the report or to implement its 
recommendations. Public knowledge of fusion center 
abuses relies almost entirely on leaks, investigative report -
ing, and researchers using open records laws to pry infor -
mation free rather than evaluations produced by official  
oversight bodies.
Even when the fusion center network has gotten the 
intelligence right and warned of an attack, it has failed to 
galvanize an effective law enforcement response. Fusion 
centers reportedly alerted federal law enforcement to social 
media posts indicating that far-right militants were prepar -
ing to engage in violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 
2021.104 FBI and DHS leadership ignored these warnings, 
however, along with other prior alarms raised by lawmak -
ers, former law enforcement and national security officials, 
social media companies, terrorism researchers, and the 
Washington Post.105 It is not clear whether the FBI and DHS 
failed to heed the fusion centers’ reporting because these 
agencies had become accustomed to discounting the faulty 
intelligence that the centers often produce or because bias 
blinded them to the threat.
There is also little evidence that fusion centers have aided 
law enforcement in addressing general crime problems, The failure to apply such restrictions predictably resulted 
in fusion centers’ submission of SARs based on ideological 
and racial biases.86 These reports often covered protest 
movements and minority communities, particularly Amer -
ican Muslims. A recent review of reports from the Chica-
go-area fusion center found a number of SARs describing 
men as suspicious based in part on their ethnic origin.87 
Among the issues that the Chicago Police Department 
ordered its officers to report to the fusion center was “infor -
mation concerning strikes, labor-management incidents 
or union controversies.”88 And an analysis of SARs submit -
ted by Mall of America security officers and local police in 
Minnesota over five years found that 65 percent of the 
reports involved people of color.89 
DHS claimed that approximately a third of the 100,000 
SARs submitted to the NSI between 2010 and 2017 had a 
“nexus to terrorism” and were uploaded to the ISE or 
eGuardian.90 But “nexus to terrorism” is a flexible term, 
particularly given DHS’s track record of treating protestors, 
journalists, and attorneys as potential terrorists.91 One 
fusion center director told researchers that he would cate -
gorize any SAR that has “anything” to do with “foreign 
nationals” as a potentially serious indicator of terrorism. 
An analyst observed that information about fraud or mari -
juana would be considered terrorism-related if “the 
money’s going to freaking somewhere in the Middle East 
with two guys from Saudi Arabia, that type of thing.”92 It is 
therefore no surprise that only 2.3 percent of those 
100,000 reports furthered an FBI investigation or involved 
someone on the terrorist watch list (both of which them-
selves have low standards).93 
DHS has done little to mitigate these issues, leaving 
fusion centers to operate largely unchecked.94 The agency’s 
Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) does conduct 
annual audits, but those audits rely on fusion centers’ 
self-reports and focus on policy implementation rather 
than substantively examining fusion centers’ operations 
and intelligence products to ensure compliance with laws, 
regulations, and policies.95 DHS lists as the first goal of its 
annual fusion center assessment to “[c]ommunicate the 
fusion centers’ value in contributing to national informa-
tion sharing and homeland security outcomes,” making 
clear that the purpose is to promote fusion centers rather 
than to critically evaluate them.96 
Nor have states picked up the slack.97 The first compre-
hensive congressional study of fusion centers, conducted 
by a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs in 2012, found signifi-
cant inconsistencies in states’ compliance with the federal 
requirement that they audit expenditures of grant funds 
and determined that states frequently failed to track fusion 
center spending separate from that of other programs.98 A 
2017 DHS inspector general report indicated that the prob -
lem has persisted: due to the way states administer federal 
law enforcement grants, DHS still could not accurately 
9 Brennan Center for Justice Ending Fusion Center AbusesState and local governments have the authority to 
determine whether the benefits of maintaining their 
fusion centers are worth the costs, particularly as they 
take on a larger share of the financial burden. And where 
particular fusion centers have a documented record of 
abuses, elected officials should be responsive to their 
constituents’ concerns and demand greater accountabil -
ity. Local advocates from Massachusetts to Texas to Cali -
fornia have called for closing fusion centers.114 In Maine, 
a bill to eliminate fusion center funding passed through 
the state house of representatives in 2021 but failed in the 
state senate.115
For its part, the federal government must ensure that 
the significant resources it devotes to fusion centers and 
the access it provides to powerful intelligence systems 
achieve their stated purpose, and that fusion center 
personnel using these resources comply with all applica-
ble laws, regulations, and policies designed to protect 
Americans’ constitutional rights and individual privacy.
This report’s recommendations fall into two categories: 
steps that the secretary of homeland security can take 
immediately and those that require congressional action. 
Taken together, these measures will reduce redundancy 
and error, strengthen civil rights and civil liberties protec-
tions, and increase transparency so that abuses can be 
quickly discovered and remediated. These new oversight 
mechanisms should reinforce the requirements of 28 
C.F.R. Part 23 to ensure that fusion centers comply with 
both the purpose and intent of the regulation for all law 
enforcement information-sharing systems.116 
Recommendations for the  
Secretary of Homeland Security
The secretary of homeland security should take the 
following actions to strengthen oversight of fusion 
centers’ use of DHS grant funds, personnel, and information-   
sharing systems.
>> Increase the transparency and accountability 
of DHS grant funding.
The secretary should mandate that DHS grant programs 
clearly articulate their federal homeland security purpose 
and ensure that all spending is traceable to its end use. 
Further, DHS should reconfigure its audits and assess -
ments of fusion centers, including the Fusion Center 
Performance Program and the annual fusion center assess -
ment. DHS audits and assessments should
	track DHS funds to ensure that they are used for their 
stated purpose, in a manner that accomplishes the 
stated goals of the grant, and in compliance with all 
applicable laws, regulations, and policies;
	focus on uncovering evidence of waste, fraud, or abuse;despite shifting their missions to cover “all crimes” and “all 
hazards.” While the number of fusion centers has expanded 
and their capabilities have increased over the last two 
decades, their intelligence collection, information-sharing, 
data analysis, and case support efforts have not demonstra -
bly helped law enforcement become more efficient or effec -
tive at solving the most serious types of crimes. Most 
violent crime in the United States still goes unsolved. The 
clearance rate for murders was just over 50 percent in 2020, 
down from rates as high as 70 percent in the 1980s, before 
any of these information-sharing systems existed.106 Just as 
the 2012 Senate investigation determined that fusion 
centers’ declared counterterrorism successes were 
disproven upon examination, law enforcement officials 
have disputed their claimed successes in solving crimes.107 
A San Jose Police Department spokesperson, for example, 
recently publicly contradicted a local fusion center’s claim 
of having assisted in the arrest of a man threatening to 
shoot up a shopping mall. The fusion center’s director later 
acknowledged that it is difficult to determine a fusion 
center’s efficacy, noting, “It’s really hard to connect a specific 
report to an arrest or specific conviction.”108
Nor have fusion centers had much apparent effect on 
crime rates. Parsing what causes crime to rise or fall is a 
difficult matter, but that did not stop the Chicago fusion 
center’s director from claiming that the center’s revolution -
ary methods were responsible for a drop in homicides in 
the city from 2007 (when the center was established) to 
2010.109 Yet the murder rate in Chicago rose significantly 
over the following years, even as the fusion center contin-
ued to operate, reaching a 25-year high of 797 homicides 
in 2021.110 Chicago police made arrests in just 26 percent 
of these cases.111
Finally, the widespread collection of SARs can swamp 
fusion centers with irrelevant reports. One fusion center 
official reported that an “overwhelming majority” of 
incoming SARs were unfounded.112 Fusion center analysts 
responding to a George Washington University survey 
described SARs as “white noise” that impedes effective 
intelligence analysis.113 
The lax standards for fusion centers’ collection and 
dissemination of information about Americans not reason -
ably suspected of criminal activity are at best an ineffective 
counterterrorism tool. At worst, they perpetuate biased 
policing practices and exhaust law enforcement resources 
that could more effectively be deployed to address serious 
criminal activity.
Recommendations 
In less than two decades, fusion centers have strayed 
far from their initial anti-terrorism mission and activities, 
continuing to receive millions in federal support even as 
oversight mechanisms have failed to curb abuses.

>> Evaluate database use. 
The secretary should require the DHS Privacy Office to 
evaluate fusion center data practices and information-   
sharing systems to ensure that all laws, regulations, and 
policies designed to protect individuals’ data from un - 
authorized disclosure are properly followed, and that the 
data is properly secured from hackers or hostile foreign

reporting; and
	identify all private data brokers and technology compa -
nies whose data and services are either contracted by 
fusion centers or accessible to federal employees 
assigned to fusion centers, and describe the nature of 
the data or services.
The secretary should regularly release detailed public 
reports documenting the results of these audits and 
assessments.
>> Evaluate civil rights and civil liberties 
implications. 
The secretary should require the DHS Office for Civil 
Rights and Civil Liberties to regularly evaluate individual 
fusion centers receiving DHS resources to identify harms 
to civil rights and civil liberties. The office should receive 
appropriate staffing and other resources to enable this 
review, and compliance on the part of the fusion centers 
should be a condition for continued federal grant funding. 
These evaluations should be scheduled so that each 
fusion center receiving DHS resources is evaluated at least 
once every three years. These evaluations should be 
designed to examine whether
	fusion center products, including bulletins, threat warn -
ings, situational reports, SARs, and other substantively

tional requirements, laws, regulations, and policies and

the targeting of critics of any private entity by law enforce -
ment, intelligence agencies, or private security.
The SIG should issue a report to Congress after one year, 
highlighting any violations of law, waste, or misuse of 
federal resources that the investigation identifies, as well 
as any violations of regulations and policies. A second 
report at the end of the SIG’s term should evaluate 
whether fusion centers implemented the requested 
reforms or otherwise resolved the issues raised during 
the SIG’s investigation. These reports may be augmented 
by interim reports as Congress or the SIG deems neces-
sary. The reports should also provide recommendations 
regarding how the federal government should regulate 
fusion centers to prevent waste, fraud, abuse, and infringe -
ments on constitutional rights, including recommenda-
tions regarding the establishment of a permanent 
oversight mechanism to ensure that future waste, fraud, 
and abuse occurring within the fusion center network is 
discovered and properly addressed in a timely manner.
>> Establish an independent federal oversight office.
Congress should establish a permanent independent 
federal oversight office charged with implementing the 
reforms recommended by the DHS audits, the Privacy 
Office and CRCL evaluations, and the SIG reports 
described above. If Congress is slow to act, the president 
could establish an oversight office by executive order.117 
The oversight office’s effectiveness will depend on its 
independence and the expertise of its staff. Congress 
should require that the attorney general, secretary  
of homeland security, and secretary of defense coordi -
nate and cooperate with the oversight office. The office 
should make direct reports to Congress, and interim 
reports should be available to members of Congress to 
view upon request. The office should be led by individuals 
selected based on experience and ability rather than Recommendations for Congress
Congress should take the following actions to investigate 
waste, fraud, and abuse within the national network of 
fusion centers.
>> Appoint a special inspector general.
Congress should establish a special inspector general 
(SIG) for the national network of fusion centers, with a 
two-year term, to investigate fusion center operations. 
The SIG should be empowered to identify any waste, 
fraud, or abuse involving resources originating from any 
federal department or agency, and should assess whether 
fusion center personnel are engaged in illegality or in 
violations of constitutional rights or federal regulations 
in the performance of their duties. The attorney general, 
director of national intelligence, secretary of homeland 
security, secretary of defense, and inspectors general from 
DHS, DOJ, the Department of Defense, and the intelli -
gence community should be directed to support the SIG 
as necessary by providing access to documents or person -
nel at their respective agencies. 
The investigation should be designed to determine 
whether
	federal funds intended to support fusion centers are 
properly disbursed, cabined to their intended federal 
purposes, and properly accounted for;

Conclusion
DHS has played a major role in developing fusion 
centers as hubs for domestic intelligence collection, but 
it has failed to conduct the oversight necessary to protect 
privacy and civil rights and to ensure that security 
resources are used responsibly and effectively. Errors, 
abuses, and security lapses over the last two decades are 
well-documented, but reform remains elusive, leaving 
the public less secure. Americans should not have to 
worry that exercising their First Amendment rights, 
whether speaking out online or protesting on the street, 
will result in an anonymous fusion center analyst labeling 
them a potential terrorist in federal intelligence networks. 
Congress and the secretary of homeland security must 
ensure that DHS fulfills its responsibilities to defend 
constitutional rights and to prevent federal law enforce-
ment and security resources from being misused to 
collect, maintain, or disseminate information that is false, 
misleading, or related to individuals or groups who are 
not reasonably suspected of criminal activity.political affiliation. Expertise in legal requirements 
regarding the protection of privacy and civil rights and 
liberties is essential.
The oversight office should be given the authority to 
access information and interview personnel from each 
fusion center. This access must include relevant databases, 
archives, personnel, and partner agencies and companies, 
including private-sector participants and contractors, 
regardless of individuals’ affiliation with other federal, 
state, or local government entities. Fusion centers should 
be required to provide this access via a designated point 
person as a condition of receiving federal grants. Oversight 
office staff must be able to attain the appropriate security 
clearances to obtain information without delay and 
conduct uninhibited conversations. Fusion centers’ 
noncompliance with requests to access their staff or infor -
mation should be grounds for penalties such as limiting 
federal funding or access to federal information-sharing 
systems.
Congress should ensure that the oversight office is 
adequately resourced to conduct robust oversight. The 
oversight office must also have support from the states 
that have legislative control over individual fusion centers. 
Congress can accomplish this requirement by making 
acceptance of the oversight office’s access and authority a 
condition of continued receipt of federal grant funding and 
access to federal information-sharing systems.
The oversight office must have the authority to require 
that fusion centers take corrective action if it identifies civil 
rights violations, discrimination, unreliable intelligence

94  Patel, Levinson-Waldman, and Panduranga, Course Correction, 
5–7 . I&A does conduct an annual audit of fusion centers. This audit 
relies on self-reported information from fusion centers, however, and 
tends toward celebrating operational metrics rather than seriously 
considering the efficacy of fusion centers or their impact on civil rights, 
civil liberties, and privacy. Thus, while we recommended in our Course 
Correction report that I&A be charged with ensuring that fusion centers 
have appropriate rules and procedures in place to protect against bias, 
we conclude that a combination of internal oversight (from the Privacy 
and CRCL offices) and external oversight (from the special inspector 
general and the federal oversight office) will be more effective.

LIBERTY AND NATIONAL SECURITY  
PROGRAM
The Brennan Center’s Liberty and 
National Security Program works  
to advance effective national 
security policies that respect 
constitutional values and the rule  
of law, using research, innovative 
policy recommendations, litigation, 
and public advocacy. The program 
focuses on reining in excessive 
government secrecy, ensuring that 
counterterrorism authorities are 
narrowly targeted to the terrorist 
threat, and securing adequate 
oversight and accountability 
mechanisms.
