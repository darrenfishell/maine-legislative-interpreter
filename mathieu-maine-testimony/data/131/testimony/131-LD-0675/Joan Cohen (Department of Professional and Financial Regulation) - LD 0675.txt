TESTIMONY OF JOAN COHEN 
DEPUTY, DEPARTMENT OF PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL REGULATION 
IN SUPPORT OF LD 675 AS AMENDED 
“An Act to Improve the Convenience of Public Restrooms ” 
Sponsored by Representative Samuel Zager 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
INNOVATION, DEVELOPMENT, ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT, AND BUSINESS 
Public Hearing: Tuesday April 18, 2023, 1:15 PM 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and honorable members of Innovation, Development, 
Economic Advancement, and Business Committee my name is Joan Cohen. and I am the Deputy at 
the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation. The Maine Plumbers ’ Examining Board 
is within the Ofﬁce of Professional and Occupational Regulation (OPOR) one of the ﬁve regulatory 
agencies within the Department. I am here to speak in support of LD 675, as amended on behalf of 
OPOR. 
The Maine plumbing code is based on the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) developed by the 
International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Ofﬁcials (IAPMO). The IAPMO updates 
the UPC every three (3) years, and the Board traditionally adopts a new edition of the UPC every 
six (6) years through the APA rulemaking process. The Board recently adopted the 2021 UPC 
so it is not slated to adopt a new version until the 2027 UPC. 
This bill, as amended, directs the Board to initiate rulemaking to make changes to its currently 
adopted plumbing code to incorporate one speciﬁc section of the 2024 UPC , Chapter 4 section 
422, into its rules. Chapter 422 updates the requirements around plumbing ﬁxtures to allow, but 
not require, all-gender bathrooms to count toward the minimum number of gender speciﬁc 
(male/female) ﬁxtures. The 2024 revisions to chapter 422 were developed by national experts 
and their considerations included wait times, parity and privacy. 
The UPC currently sets the minimum number of ﬁxtures to be calculated at 50 percent male and 
50 percent female based on the total occupancy load. Once the occupancy load and occupancy 
are determined, the UPC uses a table, broken down by type of venue, to set forth the minimum 
number of plumbing fixtures required. By adopting section 422 of the 2024 UPC, all gender

bathrooms will be eligible to count towards the total number of required ﬁxtures in accordance 
with the code. 
The Board adopts UPC updates through the APA rulemaking process. The bill requires the 
Board to commence the rulemaking process no later than December 1, 2023 which will provide 
sufﬁcient time to commence the rulemaking process. Prior to December l, OPOR staff will need 
to research and draft a rule to present to the Board. The Board will then need to vote to advertise 
the proposed mle for public notice and comment. Only after the Board considers and responds 
to the public comments, can it vote to adopt a ﬁnal rule. 
I am happy to answer questions now or at the work session.
