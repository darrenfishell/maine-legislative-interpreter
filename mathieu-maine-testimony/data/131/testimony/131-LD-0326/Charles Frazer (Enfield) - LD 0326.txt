RE: LD 326 
An Act to Improve Recruitment and Retention of First Responders  
Sen.  Michael  Tipping  of Penobscot  
 
 
Dear  Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee:   
 
The Howland Maine Fire/EMS Dep artmen t is a municipal first responder service within 
central Penobscot County and is the contracted provider for essential lifesaving  protections  to the 
Town of Enfield , Maine .  Howland is  championing  a new endeavor designed to ultimately  
provide a more effective, affordable  and sustainable Fire/EMS model for not only its current 
partner and client base, but also for a larger area of rural Maine.   This visionary initiative  to 
collaborate on a regional level  is driven by many factors, not the least of which is limited access 
to well -trained first responders.  Many of the municipalities involved in the Howland model have 
previously sponsored independent Fire/EMS Departments, but each of these efforts have fail ed 
due to limited employee and/or volunteer resources.  
 
The Town of Enfieldâ€™s  elected official s hereby express their anticipated  support of 
legislature that will improve the recruitment and retention of first responders, specifically in rural 
areas.  We lo ok forward to receiving additional details concerning LD 326. We must work 
together to  solve the current fire/EMS crisis in Maine to create acceptable levels of service and 
reliable responses, particularly in rural Maine .   
 
 
 
Sincerely , 
 
Charles Frazier  
 
Charles Frazier  
Town Manager  
Enfield , Maine
