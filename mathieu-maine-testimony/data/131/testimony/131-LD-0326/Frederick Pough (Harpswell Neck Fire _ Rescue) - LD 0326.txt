Harpswell Neck Fire & Rescue
LD 326
I am the Rescue Chief of Harpswell Neck Fire & Rescue, a small, rural, volunteer 
department. We, and other departments like ours, are struggling to maintain service. 
Our license requires us to respond 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and we currently 
have three EMTs who range in age from 70 to 81.
Our major challenge is recruiting new responders as our current generation or responders 
ages out. This is particularly difficult in Harpswell because our population base is elderly and 
housing costs are prohibitively high for young families hoping to move into the town. 
Incentives to offset these obstacles, such as tax rebates and housing assistance, would be 
valuable tools for us.
