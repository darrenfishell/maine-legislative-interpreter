Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and Distinguished Members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public safety Committee, 
I am Chief Bill Gillespie from Liberty, Maine and the Legislative Liaison for the Maine Fire Chiefs 
Association representing more than 400 Fire Chiefs throughout the state. 
l ask you to please accept this letter of Support for LD 326: An Act to Improve Recruitment and 
Retention of First Responders on behalf of the Maine Fire Chiefs Association. Fire based 
Emergency Medical Services make up 65% of the providers in the state and over the past 20 
years Maine has shown a steady decline in volunteerism, especially in the field of Emergency 
Medical Providers. 
Senate President Troy Jackson established a Blue-Ribbon Commission at the end of the 130"‘ 
Legislature that is made up of members from all the Stakeholder groups and Senator Chip Curry 
(Waldo) was the Chair. This group was established to make recommendations to the 131“ 
Legislature in regard to the condition of the Maine EMS industry. LD 326 isjust one of the many 
recommendations to come out of their hard work over the past 8 months. 
This Bill will keep the cost of becoming an Emergency Medical Provider in the state down for 
both the students, and the towns that struggle to provide funding for the members. It will also 
encourage continued education, career advancement, better opportunities, and strengthening 
our community-based services for both Career and Volunteers. 
Thank you for your consideration, 
Chief Bill Gillespie - Legislative Liaison & LOSAP Chair
