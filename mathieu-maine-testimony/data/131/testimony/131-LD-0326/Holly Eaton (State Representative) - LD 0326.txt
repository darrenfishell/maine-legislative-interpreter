Testimony of Representative Holly Eaton in support of  
LD 326, An Act to Improve Recruitment and Retention of First Responders  
Before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety  Committee  
 
Good morning, Senator Beebe -Center , Representative Salisbury  and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety  Committee . My name is Holly Eaton , and I represent House District 
15, which includes the communities of Brooklin, Deer Isle, Frenchboro, Marshall Island, 
Southwest  Harbor, Stonington, Swan’s Island, Tremont, Eagle Island Township, Isle au Haut 
and Vinalhaven. I write to you today in support of LD 326, An Act to Improve Recruitment 
and Retention of First Responders . 
 
It is increasingly difficult for rural communities like ours in Hancock County to attract and retain 
EMT’s. At a time when our state is experiencing workforce shortages, any legislative efforts we 
make to support our first responders and the rural communit ies they serve  should be a priority.  
 
Thank you for your attention. Please let me know if you have any questions that I can answer at 
the work session.
