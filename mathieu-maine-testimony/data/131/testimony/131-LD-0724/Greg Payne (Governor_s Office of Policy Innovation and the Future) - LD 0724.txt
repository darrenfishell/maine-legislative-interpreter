Testimony Neither For, Nor Against  
L.D. 724 , An Act to Expand Workforce Housing in Rural Maine by Funding the 
Maine State Housing Authority’s Rural Affordable Rental Housing Program  
 
April 14, 2023  
 
Senator Pierce , Representative Gere , and distinguished members of the Joint Select 
Committee on Housing , my name is Greg Payne and I am the Senior Advisor on 
Housing  in the Governo r’s Office o f Policy Innovation and the Future. I am here today to 
offer testimony neither for, nor against L.D. 724 – An Act to Expand Workforce 
Housing in Rural Maine by Funding the Maine State Housing Authority’s 
Rural Affordable Rental Housing Program.  
 
This bill p roposes an allocation of $10 million in FY23 -24 and another $10 million in 
FY24 -25 for the Rural Affordable Rental Housing Program administered by the Maine 
State Housing Authority. The program was created in the Maine Jobs & Recovery Plan  
(MJRP) . It funds  smaller scale developments  generally  between 5 to 18 units to fill a 
much -needed gap in Maine’s housing portfolio, particularly in smaller communities.  
 
To date, this program has seen great uptake from partners in the private sector with 
projects underway in towns like Presque Isle and Norway.  The initial allocation through 
the MJRP has been committed.  As a result, the  Mills Administration proposed an 
additional allocation of $15 million to the Rural Rental program over the course of the 
biennial . The Administration  believes this program is a key tool for addressing the 
state’s housing shortage and the funds will be deployed to help put more housing units 
online as quickly as possible.  
 
Thank you for consideration and I’d be happy to answer any questions.
