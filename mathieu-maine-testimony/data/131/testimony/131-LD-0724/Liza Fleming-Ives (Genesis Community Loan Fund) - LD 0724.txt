As you know, Genesis is working through a contract with MaineHousing to assist municipalities, 
community groups, small scale developers, and nonprofit organizations in addressing Maine's 
housing crisis. 
Since early February a Genesis team has presented eight workshops in different regions of the 
state. We offered sessions in person and online, and over 120 people participated. 
Our first purpose was to show communities how to put together development plans and 
financing for affordable housing projects. Our second was to identify projects that are ready to 
go, so long as they are funded. 
In just ten weeks, we've identified over a dozen tangible projects that will be well-suited to, and 
will need funding from, the Rural Affordable Rental Housing Program. These projects are in 
communities like Springvale, Sanford, Kittery, Bowdoinham, Thomaston, Rockport, Winslow, 
Ellsworth, Machias, Carrabassett Valley and Houlton. 
And they're not the only projects out there. We continue to hear from new communities and 
project developers every week. 
All kinds of people in rural Maine communities are ready to move forward to build critically 
needed housing with a vision of their towns’ futures. They want their communities to thrive—- 
and housing is a first step. 
You will hear today from some of the communities and developers who have projects ready to 
go. And you will have the chance to help them succeed by prioritizing funding in this session for 
the Rural Affordable Rental Housing Program. Thank you for this opportunity to testify today.
