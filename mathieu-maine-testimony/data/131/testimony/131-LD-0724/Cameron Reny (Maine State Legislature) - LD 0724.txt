All Mainers deserve the opportunity to live in safe, affordable homes, and our communities deserve the 
chance to grow and prosper. I am not here to reinvent the wheel. The Rural Affordable Rental Housing 
Program is a good program. It gives districts like mine a real chance to increase our housing stock for 
our community members. Funding this program can help to tackle our housing crisis throughout the 
state, and as we all know, this housing crisis is everywhere — not just in our larger city centers. 
I understand this committee has already advocated for funding the Rural Affordable Rental Housing 
Program. First of all, thank you. Whatever vehicle you choose to fund this program, Whether my bill or 
someone else’s, I wholeheartedly support its passage and am eager to contribute in any Way possible. I 
am here to achieve the best outcomes for my constituents. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. Following my testimony, you will have the opportunity to 
hear from experts who can provide more in-depth information on the history and speciﬁcs of the 
program. That said, I’m happy to answer any questions you may have. 
Sincerely, 
Cameron Reny
