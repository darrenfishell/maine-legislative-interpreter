LD 724 
To Chairpersons Teresa Pierce, Traci Gere, and the members of the Housing Committee: 
0 My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham, Maine. 
I I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and Managers 
Association, GBAOIVIA. 
v I am also a member of the Legislative Council working closely with, Attorney and Lobbyist, Dan 
Bernier representing landlords and property owners In, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, 
Portland, South Portland, Lewiston, Auburn, and Bangor areas. 
0 I have been a landlord since 1972. I have owned a 50-unit trailer park , multi-unit, and single- 
family homes. At one time, I managed 65 units. I have mostly provided affordable housing to 
low-income tenants. 
0 I am speaking in SUPPORT of this Bill. 
0 I feel there is a shortage of rental units in most small towns. The young people go to the cities to 
work and live. They are away from their family support system and sometimes get involved in 
destructive behavior including drug use. There are bills introduced this year to pay for support 
people to help those with addiction problems. 
0 More housing in rural areas may help keep people closer to those that care about them. 
0 I would suggest that some of these funds go to existing small landlords to assist them in providing 
more housing units in rural areas. 
0 I am here to ask you to SUPPORT LD 724 
0 Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. I would be happy to answer any questions.
