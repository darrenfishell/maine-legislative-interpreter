Testimony of Abby Farnham, Assistant Director, Policy and Research, Maine Farmland Trust, 
to the 131st Legislature’s  Joint Select Committee on Housing  
April 14, 2023  
 
Good morning Senator Pierce , Representative Gere , and members of the Joint S elect  
Committee on Housing . My name is Abby Farnham  and I am testifying today on behalf of Maine 
Farmland Trust (MFT) in support of LD 724, An Act to Expand Workforce Housing in Rural Maine 
by Funding the Maine State Housing Authority's Rural Affordable Rental H ousing Program . 
 
MFT is a member -powered statewide organization that works to protect farmland, support 
farmers, and advance the future of farming. Since our founding in 1999, MFT has helped to 
permanently protect more than 330 farms and keep nearly 60,000  acres of farmland in farming. 
In 2022 alone, MFT supported 48 farm businesses with workshops, technical assistance, and 
grants – delivering over 680 hours of technical assistance and $309,000 in business and seed 
grants to help businesses grow their profi tability.  Our main program areas are Farmland 
Protection, Farmland Access, Stewardship, Farm Business Planning, PFAS Support, Climate 
Resilience, and Policy and Research.  
 
MFT believes that to support Maine’s rural economic development, farms must be 
econ omically viable. We often hear from farmers about the recurring challenge they have with 
labor supply and retention as well as the rising costs of labor. Farmers increasingly face 
challenges finding labor they need, when they need it. The lack of available , affordable and 
adequate housing, particularly in rural parts of the state, is contributing to the agricultural labor 
shortages that Maine farmers are experiencing.  
 
MFT supports LD 724 because it would help to address the need for workforce housing in 
Maine’s rural communities by providing funding to the Rural Affordable Rental Housing 
Program within the Maine State Housing Authority for the development of smaller affordable 
rental housing projects. This legislation won’t solve farm labor challenges, but  it is an important 
piece of the puzzle. Solutions to farm labor challenges will help to support the economic 
viability of Maine’s agricultural sector, and agriculture is  a key component of Maine’s economy 
overall, contributing over $3.6 billion in economi c impact and supporting over 27,000 jobs 
statewide.1 
 
While not necessarily within the scope of this bill, we also want to put forward the importance 
of directing development away from working agricultural lands. The 2017 Census of Agriculture

 showed that between 2012 and 2017, Maine lost more than 10 percent of its farmland, over 
146,000 acres2—making Maine one of the top five states in the country with the highest 
percentage of farmland lost.3 Maine’s farmland is at risk from all types of development, 
including low -density residential development, which fragments the agricultural land base and 
threatens the viability of an area’s remaining working farms.4 The application of smart growth 
principles that reduce sprawl and balance the need for additional hous ing, particularly 
affordable housing, with the need to protect our state’s working farms and critical agricultural 
resources is essential for addressing the affordable housing crisis in ways that also ensure we 
have the land base needed to grow our agricul tural economy and create greater food security 
for our state.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 724.
