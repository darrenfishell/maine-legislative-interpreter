Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
200,
“An
Act
to
Require
Medicaid
Coverage
for
Certain
Children
Under
7
Years
of
Age”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
200.
This
bill
would
require
the
state
to
cover
health
care
for
a
child
under
seven
through
MaineCare
(Medicaid),
regardless
of
that
child’s
family’s
ability
to
pay,
if
that
child
is
not
covered
through
a
parent
or
guardian’s
employer-sponsored
plan
or
another
private
plan.
Making
sure
that
children
have
access
to
appropriate
medical
care
should
be
a
basic
tenet
of
society,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
it
should
be
a
legal
mandate.
Ultimately,
mandating
that
one’s
health
care
be
covered
means
that
the
state
will
involuntarily
conscript
the
labor
of
a
doctor
or
other
medical
practitioner
without
sufficiently
compensating
that
professional
for
their
services.
They
must
provide
this
care
by
law,
and
will
be
reimbursed
at
a
rate
much
below
the
operating
cost
to
provide
such
care.
By
eschewing
family
income
limits,
this
bill
simply
creates
a
moral
hazard.
It
incentivizes
middle-
and
upper-income
parents
to
rely
on
MaineCare
to
cover
their
young
children
instead
of
working
to
provide
necessary
care
for
them
on
their
own.
MaineCare
should
be
a
last
resort
program
for
those
who
truly
cannot
take
care
of
their
own
needs
and
need
financial
support.
That
is
precisely
why
MaineCare
expansion
is
an
inappropriate
expansion
of
the
program’s
scope.
Instead
of
covering
nearly
93,000
able-bodied
Mainers
under
the
age
of
65
without
dependents
(as
of
February
1,
2023),
the
state
should
ensure
that
limited
MaineCare
resources
are
targeted
toward
the
state’s
most
vulnerable
and
truly
needy.

Please
deem
LD
200
“Ought
Not
To
Pass,”
forgo
this
unnecessary
moral
hazard
and
instead
work
to
remove
onerous
and
anti-competitive
administrative
barriers
in
Maine’s
healthcare
regulations
in
order
to
sustainably
expand
care
to
all
who
desire
it.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
