My name is Dan Fortune, and I am writing this to express my OPPOSITION to LD 714 (An act to 
repeal protections provided by Good Samaritan. 
As someone who loves people who suffer from SUD, I know firsthand the devastating impact 
that addiction can have on individuals and their loved ones. It is heartbreaking to watch 
someone you care about struggle with this disease, and it reinforces my belief that we need to 
do everything we can to support those who are suffering. Addiction is a disease and a mental 
health problem, not a moral failing, and those struggling with it need access to medical 
treatment and support. 
 
In my experience as a recovery ally and certified recovery coach, addressing trauma is one of 
the best ways to help those who suffer from SUD. Many individuals with addiction have 
experienced significant trauma in their lives and addressing these underlying issues can be a 
key component of their recovery. This includes providing access to trauma-informed care and 
support, as well as addressing systemic issues such as poverty, racism, and discrimination.  By 
doing so, we can prevent individuals from falling into the trap of addiction in the first place and 
help those who are struggling to recover. 
 
By taking a holistic approach to addiction treatment that addresses both the physical and 
emotional needs of individuals with SUD, we can help them achieve long-term recovery and 
improve their overall quality of life. It is not enough to simply treat the symptoms of addiction; 
we need to address the root causes and provide ongoing support to those in recovery. Truly 
helping requires a community effort, including healthcare providers, mental health 
professionals, family members, and peers in recovery. 
As a society, we need to recognize that addiction is a complex issue that requires a 
compassionate and evidence-based response. We need to work together to reduce the stigma 
surrounding addiction and provide individuals with SUD with the resources and support they 
need to achieve a healthy and fulfilling life. 
Removing Good Samaritan protections would only add to the stigma and shame that individuals 
with SUD already face. It sends a message that their lives are not valued and that they are not 
deserving of help. This is simply not true. People with SUD are human beings who deserve 
dignity, respect, and access to life-saving medical care. Good Samaritan protections are crucial 
for those who may be hesitant to seek medical assistance in an emergency. They provide a level 
of protection from criminal charges for individuals who may be in possession of drugs or 
paraphernalia when calling for help, removing the fear of legal repercussions and allowing for 
timely access to medical attention. 
 
However, it is important to note that Good Samaritan protections are not a license to break the 
law. It is important to maintain these protections as they are an essential tool in addressing the 
opioid epidemic and other drug-related emergencies. In situations where seconds count, 
individuals should not have to choose between seeking medical help and protecting themselves 
from legal consequences.  
Moreover, maintaining Good Samaritan protections promotes a culture of safety and 
encourages individuals to take action when they witness an overdose or other medical 
emergency. This can ultimately save lives and prevent further harm. 
 
In summary, Good Samaritan protections are a crucial component of our response to drug-
related emergencies. They provide essential protection to individuals who may be hesitant to 
seek medical attention, without condoning or promoting illegal drug use. By maintaining these 
protections, we can promote a culture of safety and encourage individuals to take action when 
faced with an emergency situation. 
 
Thank you for your time and attention in this very important matter.
