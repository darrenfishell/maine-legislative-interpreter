LD 714
I am writing to oppose LD714, a bill to roll  back protections for those in need. I think
it is imperative to always work to save people's lives and not all helping people cause 
the helper to be put in jeopardy. These protections were put in place and they are 
helping. Why remove those protections now? The Good Samaritan law works. Leave 
it in place.
Thank you for your time.
