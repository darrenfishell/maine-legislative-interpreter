Ought not to pass
Stop arresting people for  poverty, homelessness, mental illness
 & substance use.  
All of these issues are increasing incarceration in ME & nationally.
We aren't correcting anything if we keep increasing the number of jail beds we will 
fill.  In fact, its and acknowledgement of systemic failure.
I support diversity, equity, inclusion.
I support help for struggling families and decriminalization of diseases of 
hopelessness
I support practices for restorative justice & dignity for all.
I reject increasing arrests, jails and the US punitive culture which is a proven failure.
