Chelsea Stephens
Portland 
LD 714
 Hello Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee. My Name is Chelsea Stephens, I’m a 
constituent in Portland and I’m here to speak in opposition to LD 714. As a social 
worker I used to work with folks in active substance use as well as folks in the early 
stages of recovery. I do not believe that expanding the crimes that do not qualify for 
immunity to include drug-related crimes will help improve the safety of the 
community or even lead to more effective law enforcement. It would simply ensure 
that people who fear being arrested for those crimes will not call in the first place, or 
if they do call, that they will leave the person in medical crisis alone before help 
arrives.This will lead to even more overdose deaths than we’re already seeing. People 
can’t recover if they don’t first survive. Thank you for your time.
