LD 714
Hi, 
My name is Colin Vettier, I'm a Portland resident and I'd like to share my opposition 
to LD 714.
As overdoses continue to rise in Maine, we cannot roll back the protections people 
have when they call 9-1-1 from the sense of an overdose. To the contrary, we must 
ensure that everyone knows this law exist. We must continue to save lives.
Itâ€™s critical that the legislature opposes LD 714: An Act to Expand the List of Crimes 
That Do Not Qualify for Immunity Under Maine's Good Samaritan Laws Concerning 
Drug Related Medical Assistance.
