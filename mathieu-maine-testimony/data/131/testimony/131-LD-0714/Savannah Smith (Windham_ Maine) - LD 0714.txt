LD 714
To the Representative Salisbury and Honorable members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee. My name is Savannah Smith and I live in Windham, 
Maine. I'm writing this opposing Bill LD 714. In my personal experience, The Good 
Samaritan Act saves lives. The protection that it gives to all individuals that are put 
into a crisis situation involving saving one's life. Taking away this protection creates a
huge dilemma in that if someone chooses to save someone's life then they may 
possibly be charged criminally. Addiction is a disease and no one should have to 
worry about someone from their community thinking twice in calling for help to save 
their life because of the underlying fear of the new consequences of helping others. 
Drugs are killing individuals instantly, so why are going to make people think of the 
pros and cons of helping a person get medical attention? What if by the time they 
made a decision, it was too late for the person who needed their help? This is not 
making the public safe, it's creating fear for every community that makes up Maine. 
Keeping Maine safe is keeping The Good Samaritan Act. Most everyone has 
utilitarianism within them. They can tell between right and wrong by focusing on the 
outcome. Now what is right about leaving someone who needs medical attention? 
Nothing. The right thing to do is to NOT make it harder for people to make the right 
decision. I know I would want someone to call 911 if I needed medical attention as 
would the next person. This doesn't just affect ONE person, it affects the whole state 
of Maine. It's important to keep this act and the protection it gives to the people. 
Without it, it creates fear among the communities. I trust you all will make the right 
decision in keeping Maine Safe. Thank you.
