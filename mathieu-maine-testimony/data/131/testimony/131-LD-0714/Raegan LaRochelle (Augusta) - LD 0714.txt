District 59: Augusta (part) 
  
 
Testimony of Representative Raegan F. LaRochelle in opposition to 
LD 714 An Act to Expand the List of Crimes That Do Not Qualify for Immunity Under 
Maine’s Good Samaritan Laws Concerning Drug-related Medical Assistance 
before the Joint Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
 
April 24, 2023 
  
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and esteemed members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety, my name is Raegan LaRochelle and I represent House District 59, which is 
part of Augusta. I’m here today to speak in strong opposition to LD 714, An Act to Expand the List of Crimes 
that Do Not Qualify for Immunity Under Maine’s Good Samaritan Law Concerning Drug-related Medical 
Assistance. 
 
In the 130th Legislative Session, I was a proud co-sponsor of LD 1862, known as the Good Samaritan Bill. This 
bill became law after countless people with lived experience testified and contacted their legislators to let them 
know that the Good Samaritan Bill, as it was written, would help to save lives.  
 
Nothing has changed in the past year that would necessitate adding barriers for people at the scene of an 
overdose to call 911.  This bill, if enacted, would be endangering the lives of people experiencing overdoses.  
 
Efforts to educate the community and dispel myths about the Good Samaritan Law are currently underway. 
Even despite this critical new law, overdose deaths have risen in the past year. This is not the time to make 
changes and add confusion to a law that isn’t broken.  
 
I know people who have received lifesaving Naloxone doses from first responders after people on the scene 
have called 911. They are my loved ones, friends and employees. On behalf of all of these people, I urge the 
Committee not to increase barriers to calling 911.  Please vote Ought Not to Pass on this bill, because dead 
people cannot recover.
