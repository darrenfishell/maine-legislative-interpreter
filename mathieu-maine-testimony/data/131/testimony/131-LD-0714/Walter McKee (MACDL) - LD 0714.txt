RE: LD 714 --  An Act to Ex pand the List of Crimes That Do Not Qualif y for 
Immunity Under Maineâ€™ s Good Samaritan Laws  
 
Dear Senator Beebe -Center , Represe ntative  Salisbury, and Mem bers of the Crimin al 
Justice  and Pu blic Safety Committe e: 
 
MACDL oppose s LD 714. 
 
Here we go aga in. The ink is barely dry on the  law that correctly expa nded the list of 
crimes under the Good Samaritan law , and this bill comes forward . Instead of waiting 
to see how the new  law works out in saving people from overdo ses, this bill seeks to 
undo the law.  Do not do it. 
 
As it stands  now, and after vigorous  and product ive debate the last legislative  session, 
there  is a care fully cra fted list of crimes that a pers on who reports an  overdo se while  
providing assistance  cannot be prosecuted for based o n the information  derived  from 
the emergenc y response . The debate on that bill was extensive and compromise  was 
reached  and t he bill was passe d.  
 
And yet here we are n ow looking at changes already , all for no goo d reason .  If th e 
Legislature  and this Committee are serious about enactin g laws to make change, then 
it stands to reason that one might want to see what changes are made before deciding  
that the re should not have  been a law in the first place.  
 
Subtracting out drug crimes from the immunity  provision  flies in the fac e of the fact 
that this bill protects  someone  from reporting an overdo se on drugs. It is hard to 
understand a more direct crime tha n drug  crimes that should  be part of t he immunity  
provisions . These are the very crimes that cause someone  not to report an overdose , 
and can cause that person  to potentially  make the wrong decision and risk the death of 
another.  
 
Do n ot change what no one can say is not wor king, especially  given the work that was 
done in the last session  to enac t this important  bill. 
 
As always , thank you for the opportunity to address this issue.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Walter F. McKee  
Chair, Legi slative Committee
