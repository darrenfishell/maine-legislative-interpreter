IN OPPOSITION TO LD714: An Act to Expand the List of Crimes That Do Not 
Qualify for Immunity Under Maine's Good Samaritan Law Concerning Drug Related 
Medical Assistance
April 24, 2023
Representative Campbell and Committee Chairperson BeeBe-Center and 
Representative Salizbury, and the honorable Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee. Hello, my name is Randy Beard. I am an organizer for ME-Rap & The 
Founder of Recover2gether. I am here to oppose the change to the Good Sam for 
Maine bill.
I am able to be an advocate, recovery coach, residential administrator in a long term 
rehabilitation program, a dad, grandfather and to be ALIVE – because somebody was 
willing to call 911. Despite knowing they would be arrested, they made the morally 
correct decision to stay with me until the EMT’s arrived.
But I can tell you, I have had three friends who were not so lucky and are no longer 
alive to tell their story because the people who were with them feared prosecution. 
One was left in a motel bathroom, one was dragged into a hallway of a trap house, 
and one was disgustingly dragged out of his own apartment and thrown into his trash 
pile.
These are only a few examples of something that happens tragically everyday on the 
front line of the war on drugs!
Drugs are not going anywhere and with fentanyl and other substances now, things are 
only getting worse and much deadlier! The bottom line is every life matters. By 
changing the Strongest Good Sam Law you are only adding gas to the fire. Instead, 
we should be setting a trend for the entire nation and make a stand to lead the way.
I am pleading with all of you to not change our Good Sam Law. Instead be trend 
setters, stand behind it, and endorse it nationally. If it wasn’t for the Good Sam Law, 
people like myself wouldn’t be here to show that recovery can and will happen! I urge
your committee to Protect our Good Sam Law and vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS on 
LD714.
Randy Beard
