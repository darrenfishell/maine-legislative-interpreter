LD 714
Dear Honorable Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee:
My name is Chloe Maxmin. I am submitting testimony against LD 714.
I am the former State Senator from District 13 and the original sponsor last Session of
the Expanded Good Samaritan Law, a law that is designed to encourage people to call
9-1-1 from the scene of an overdose to get the help they need. Last legislative session,
hand in hand with Maine's recovery community, we passed and Governor Mills' 
signed into law the strongest Good Samaritan Law in the Nation. We did this because 
we know that saving lives is the most important thing that can happen at the scene of 
an overdose. 
However, this Session, LD 714 threatens to undermine these historic changes by 
rolling back key provisions of the law. If passed, LD 714 would render the Expanded 
Good Samaritan Law ineffective. 
I am writing today with a strong call to action to my former colleagues in the 
legislature: please oppose LD 714. The core message of the Good Sam campaign 
remains the same: we must save lives. We cannot abandon this principle as overdose 
rates continue to skyrocket. If we care about our loved ones experiencing substance 
use, we must oppose LD 714.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Chloe Maxmin
