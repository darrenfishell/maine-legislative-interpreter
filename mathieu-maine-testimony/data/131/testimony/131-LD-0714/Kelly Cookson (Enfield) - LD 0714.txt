Testimony by Kelly Cookson in Opposition of LD714  
 
Dear esteemed members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,  
My name is Kelly Cookson. I am a constituent from Enfield. In 2003 before the enactment of the Good 
Samaritan Bill, my daughter’s father Ricky tragically lost his life at the age of 28. He was presumed to 
have overdosed by the people he was with the night of February 14th and dumped in a parking lot in 
sub-zero temperatures. His cause of death was later found to be hypothermia from being left in the 
snow. If this law had been in effect at that time and EMS had been dispatched, he would still be with us. 
Fast forward to 2016 when our daughter Ava was struggling with managing her own substance use 
disorder. She overdosed and the person she was with did seek medical assistance knowing he would be 
protected from prosecution for having narcotics in his home. She is now 6 ½ years free from a heroin 
and crack addiction and living a full, beautiful life. I cannot begin to describe the impact losing her would 
have had on our family and especially myself as her mother.  
Though her substance use disorder is now in remission, Ava and many others suffer the loss of her 
father every day. By adding drug crimes to list not covered by immunity, the overdose deaths that are 
already continuing to rise at an alarming rate will skyrocket in Maine. Many more people will die like 
Ricky and never have a chance of finding recovery like Ava has.  
This bill will be nearly ineffective if people have to worry about their own legal implications by saving a 
life. I have experienced firsthand the positive impacts of the Good Samaritan Bill, and also what happens 
when people are afraid to call 911.  
Please consider the implications on your constituents if this rollback is passed and vote “no”. Thank you 
for your attention to this important matter.
