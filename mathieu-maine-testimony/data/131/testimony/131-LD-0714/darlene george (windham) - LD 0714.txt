LD 714
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and honorable members of the 
Criminal Justice and public safety Committee.
My name is Darlene George I’m writing to oppose LD 714, May 3, 2022, Governor 
Janet Mills signed LD 1862, An Act To Strengthen Maine's Good Samaritan Laws 
Concerning Drug-related Medical Assistance (known as the Good Samaritan Bill), 
into law. 
There was a reason that it was submitted in law,  too many people were dying 
unnecessarily, everyone’s life is just as precious as the next. We as a country have to 
stop and think about what if it was me??  Your child??, your parents?Would you want
someone to leave you on the side of the road?, or just decide not to help you because 
they could get into trouble.
Currently 50 states have the Good Samaritan law. What does that say to you!!!!, it 
says to me that it’s needed in the worst way. 
10,110 overdoses were reported in Maine in 2022, including 716 suspected or 
confirmed deaths, for a survival rate over the year of nearly 93 percent. For December
2022, 928 people in Maine experienced a drug overdose, with 75 suspected or 
confirmed deaths.
I’m currently housed at Maine Correctional Center and we experience our friends' 
Od'ing quite often. I have to think how many more are going to die when the 
proposed changes go into law, one life is too many.
Someone should not have to decide to do the right thing or walk away because of the 
consequences. 
I think that money should be invested into the community for medical, mental, and 
dual diagnosis help for people who are suffering from this disease.
Again I ask that no you reconsider making any changes to LD 714.
Darlene George
