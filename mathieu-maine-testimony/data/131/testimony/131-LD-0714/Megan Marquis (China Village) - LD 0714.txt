LD 714
Dear "Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,"
My name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China Village, Maine. I am writing today to
ask you to oppose LD 714 because I believe making it easier to safe lives at the scene 
is more important than finding slim technicalities to punish people that are trying to 
save lives. When did the police stop trying to protect and serve? At the end of the day,
more people that are alive is a good thing, so why are we so quick to punish people 
that are trying to seek care for their loved ones. This affects me because people I 
know would sooner die alone than seek necessary lifesaving care- if the SAM law 
reverted backwards. That's not right. So start caring more about protecting human 
lives, instead of padding your quotas - like your mothers should have taught you 
already. 
Oppose LD 714 and save human lives already.
