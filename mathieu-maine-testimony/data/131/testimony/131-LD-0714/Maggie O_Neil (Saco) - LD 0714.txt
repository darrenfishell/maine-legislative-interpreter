Testimony of Rep. Maggie O’Neil presenting  
LD 1225 , An Act to Protect Housing by Increasing the Property Tax 
Fairness Credit  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation  
 
Senator Beebe -Center, Representative Sal isbury and members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee, I am Rep. Maggie O’Neil. I represent House District 129, part of Saco. Thank 
you for the opportunity to speak in opposition to LD 714, An Act to Expand the List of Crimes 
That Do Not Q ualify for Immunity Under Maine's Good Samaritan Laws Concerning 
Drug -related Medical Assistance .  
 
Last session, I was proud to support LD 1862, which we passed and Gov. Mills signed, making 
Maine’s Good Samaritan Law the strongest in the country. That i s thanks to a broad coalition of 
harm reduction advocates, health care providers, lawmakers from both parties, and others who 
worked incredibly hard on LD 1862, because they know that Good Sam saves lives.  
 
In an emergency, we need to feel safe to be able  to call for help. We have emergency services so 
that we can respond to emergencies and save lives. We cannot create barriers to seeking help.  
 
The U.S. Government Accountability Office found that states with Good Sam laws have lower 
rates of opioid -related overdose deaths.1 It found that individuals are more likely to call 911 in 
case of an emergency if they are aware of Good Sam legal protections. Its report also stated that 
understanding and awareness of Good Sam laws are key to their effectiveness.   
 
At a time when, on average, more than one Mainer dies every day from overdose, the importance 
of an effective Good Sam law cannot be overstated. In 2022, 716 people died as a result of drug

District 129: Saco (part)  
 overdoses - 75 in December alone.2 Our response to this public healt h crisis must provide 
treatment and support to address problematic drug use, but before we can access treatment and 
support, we need to keep community members alive. Proven harm reduction measures like Good 
Sam save lives.  
 
LD 714 would dismantle the prog ress we have made. It chips away at the clarity and simplicity 
that makes our Good Sam law effective. When someone is overdosing, the decision to call for 
help needs to be as straightforward as possible.  
 
Our current Good Sam law does not extend protections to those who are committing crimes 
against children, sex crimes, or other violent crimes. These safeguards are already in place.   
 
LD 714 hinders public safety more than it helps. It will cost the lives  of our community 
members. Please join me in opposing the bill. Thank you for your consideration.
