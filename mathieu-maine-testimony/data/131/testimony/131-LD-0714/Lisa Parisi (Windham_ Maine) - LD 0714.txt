Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee of Criminal Justice and public 
hearing. An Act to Expand the List of Crimes That Do Not Qualify for Immunity 
Under Maine's Good Samaritan Laws Concerning Drug-related Medical Assistance 
on April 24, 2023
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and Members of the 
Committee: I am testifying as an individual member of The community who presides 
in Windham, Maine. I am testifying in opposition to bill 714. 
 As an addict in recovery.  There is a distinct contrast between the way the community
handled an overdose pre-Good Samaritan law to how they are handled post-Good 
Samaritan law. This law has saved many lives and made it safe for citizens to call for 
help in a crisis. We have to remember the act of utilitarianism. The greatest good for 
the greatest amount of people. The lives of others should not be jeopardized to bring 
the arrest rate up, and fight addiction and crime, this is an ethical dilemma that affects
our brothers, sisters, children, mothers, fathers our children, and the community. 
People should not be put in a situation in which they have to pick their freedom over a
fellow human's life. Especially where their thinking is skewed due to substances.  In a
situation where drug-related crime is taking place, the substance user is at times 
hyper-paranoid and put in a crisis they are likely to flee the scene in fear of 
reciprocation by authorities. Is an arrest worth a human life?  
Whether they suffer from substance abuse disorder should not reflect the way a 
community responds to life. Please take this into consideration when making your 
decision.
