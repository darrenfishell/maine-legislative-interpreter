Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and 
distinguished members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety: 
l am State Representative Richard H. Campbell, and l proudly represent District 
l9, Eddington, Holden, and Orrington. It is an honor to appear before you 
today for the purpose of speaking on the merits of L.D. 7i 4, “An Act to Expand 
the List of Crimes That Do Not Qualify for Immunity Under Maine's Good 
Samaritan Laws Concerning Drug-related Medical Assistance “. 
The intent of this proposed legislation is simple and straight forward, it is to 
provide a mechanism for law enforcement to hold to account persons involved 
in drug trafficking and unlawful possession of firearms. 
Under the existing statute, law enforcement could respond to a scene and 
encounter trafficking amounts of dangerous drugs, like fentanyl; and firearms 
and would be prohibited from taking any enforcement action. 
The preservation of life should always be a priority. We must also prioritize 
holding people accountable for selling dangerous drugs and for the unlawful 
possession of firearms, as both of those behaviors puts lives at risk. 
Thank you for your time.
