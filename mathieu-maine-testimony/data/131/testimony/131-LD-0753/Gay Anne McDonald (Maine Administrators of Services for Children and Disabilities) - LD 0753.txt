Support of LD 753 
An Act to Allow Retired Teachers and Educational Technicians to be Recertiﬁed 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Gay Anne McDonald and I am the 
Executive Director for the Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities 
(MADSEC). 
On behalf of MADSEC, I am providing testimony in support of LD 7531 An Act to Allow 
Retired Teachers and Educational Technicians to be Recertiﬁed. 
MADSEC believes that the passing of this bill would assist school administrative districts 
with the signiﬁcant workforce shortage they are currently experiencing, especially in 
special education. 
MADSEC would like to highlight the importance of ensuring that all retired applicants 
seeking recertiﬁcation undergo the required criminal background check as for anyone 
working with students, and perhaps suggest that they re—certify every 5 years, consistent 
with other teachers and educational technicians to ensure they are up—to—date with best 
practices. 
Thank you for your time, consideration, and service to our state.
