TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 753 
AN ACT TO ALLOW RETIRED TEACHERS AND EDUCATIONAL 
TECHNICIANS TO BE RECERTIFIED 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Eileen King, deputy executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 753. 
Our organizations enthusiastically support this bill as it allows dedicated teachers and ed techs to return to the 
classroom after retirement even if their certiﬁcation has lapsed. By removing the steps needed to regain 
certiﬁcation through the traditional process, retired educators can easily return to the classroom. This is 
critical to those districts who have vacancies in the classroom that must be ﬁlled to meet the needs of our 
students. 
We support that the certiﬁcate must be issued with the same grades and subject areas as the educator ’s last 
professional certiﬁcate. Title 5, Chapter 423 section 17859 for those educators who retire and return to work 
should be the guide for the employment of these individuals. We continue to support these requirements.
