Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources  
LD 217  
An Act to Support Manufacturers Whose Products Contain  
Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances  
TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION  
Public Hearing  
April 26, 2023  
 
 
Honorable Senator Brenner, Chair; Honorable Representative 
Gramlich, Chair; and Honorable Committee Members:  
  
 Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony IN 
OPPOSITION TO LD 217 . Representative Cam pbell is seeking an 
amendment that would extend th e January 1, 2023 deadline for 
reporting the use of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
in products for sale in the State of Maine to January 1, 2025 making 
it retroactive to January 1, 2023 . PFAS pollution poses a significant 
public health and e nvironmental threat to Maine and its citizens. 
Legislators, regulators, and other officials are scrambling to address 
the currently revealed ubiquitous contamination with  this class of 
forever toxic chemicals of our waters. lands, wildlife, and people. 
Presently, there are no cost -effective, or to -scale methods for 
removal and remediation of PFAS contamination. We must 
approach this issue from a “turn off the tap”  perspective.  
 LD 1537 provides a reasonable approach to begin the 
process of protecting the public health and environment  from the 
2 
 
unabated deluge of PFAS toxics.  There is no justification to delay 
implementing judicious policy.  
 Thank you for considering my comments. I ask the 
COMMITTEE VOTE OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
