Can anyone say potential land grab???
I'm neither for or against on the following bills:
LD 217, LD 304, LD 1214, LD 1273, LD 1537
What is really needed are remediation measures for this issue. Here is one potential 
measure:

Yes. You will need to copy and paste this into your favorite browser. I think you will 
be pleasantly surpised. Affordable remediation technologies do exist.
Thank you
