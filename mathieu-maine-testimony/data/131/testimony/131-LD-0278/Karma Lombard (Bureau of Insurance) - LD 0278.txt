Re: L.D. 0278, An Act to Require Health Plans to Cover an Annual Mental Health Wellness 
Examination  
Dear Senator Bailey , Representative Perry , and Members of the Committee:  
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 0278.  The purpose of this letter is to provide you with background information.  This bill would require carriers offering health plans in the State to provide coverage for an annual mental health wellness exam.  The requirements of the bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2024.  
It is unclear whether this  mandated coverage would be in addition to or instead of the current 
requirements of 4320 -A.  This section requires the first  behavioral health office visit at no 
charge.  A fter the first behavioral health office visit, the copayment amount for a behavioral 
health office visit may not  be greater than the copayment for a primary care office visit.  As 
currently worded, the bill is not clear  what is to be included in such an ex am and what 
qualifications providers should have who could give such an exam.  
Beginning in 2014, states were required to defray the costs of all mandates that are included in Qualified  Health Plans, unless those mandates are required as part of the essenti al benefit 
package.  The  Affordable Care Act (ACA) directs states to make payments either to the 
individual enrollee or to the  insurer.
1  Generally, any mandate adopted by a state after December 
31, 2011 is subject to the requirement for the state to defray the additional premium cost  of that 
mandate.  However, if this bill is determined to be the expansion of an existing mandate rather 
than a new mandate, it is our understanding that the state would not have to defray the cost.  
Title 24 -A M.R.S. ยง 2752 requires  a review and evaluation of a mandated benefit proposal by the 
Bureau of Insurance before the bill may be enacted.  These reviews include an evaluation of the financial impact, social impact and medical efficacy of the mandate. If a report is request ed it 
could cost the Bureau up to $13,500 for outside contract consulting work plus staff time, estimated at a cost of $1,600 to collect in formation, review consultant work, and prepare the final 
report.  We anticipate that current resources will allow us to conduct up to two studies during the current session, and we will need eight weeks for each report to ensure a high- quality evaluation.

I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance.
