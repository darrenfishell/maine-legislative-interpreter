Re:  LD 278 An Act to Require Health Plans to Cover an Annual Mental Health Wellness Examination 
Dear Senator Bailey and Representative Perry:
The Maine Psychological Association (MePA) is a membership organization representing psychologists in 
Maine who work in private practice, at Maine’s colleges and universities, and in the public sector. Our 
mission is to advance psychology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promoting health and 
human welfare. 
MePA supports LD 278: An Act to Require Health Plans to Cover an Annual Mental Health Wellness 
Examination, requiring a health plan to provide for this important coverage annually to meet the federal 
and state mental health parity laws. 
According to CMS.gov, “The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA) provided that large group health 
plans cannot impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health benefits that are less favorable 
than any such limits imposed on medical/surgical benefits.”
Sincerely,
Jamie Pratt, PsyD
President
