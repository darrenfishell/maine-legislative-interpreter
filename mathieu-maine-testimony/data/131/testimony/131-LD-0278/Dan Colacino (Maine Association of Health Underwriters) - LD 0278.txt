RE:  LD #   278 
_____________________________________________________________________________________  
On behalf of the Maine Association of Health Underwriters  (Maine AHU) , I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to submit  comments on the proposed bill. 
 MaineAHU is a state chapter of the National Association of Health Underwriters and represents licensed 
agents, brokers , and employee benefit consultants  who sell and service individual and group health, disability, 
Medicare,  and long -term care insurance.  
We are writing  neith er to support nor oppose LD 278 but to point out concern s we have with the language.  
The bill revises 24-A MRSA §4320 -A, sub -§1 which outlines preventive services to be covered with no imposition of 
a deductible.  The ACA defines preventive care in Notic e 2013 -57 as “… the preventive health services required under 
section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act)  ) to be provided by a group health plan or a health insurance 
issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage. ”  The concern  we have is with the impact of this bill 
on Health Saving Accounts (HSA) which many Maine residents have and contribute to.  If the definition of LD  #278 
is not part of the designated Preventive Health benefits outlined in the Affordable Care Act, then thi s bill will 
invalidate the hundreds of HSA plans currently in force and prevent members from contributing to their Savings 

Account.  We would strongly recommend a waiver of this benefit for those members enrolled in an HSA plan much 
as was done in the last  session for LD 1822 , now MRSA 4320 -A sub 3.    The exception was worded as such:  
“This subsection does not apply to a plan offered for use with a health savings account unless the federal 
Internal Revenue Service determines that the benefits required by t his section are permissible benefits in a 
high deductible health plan as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, Section 223(c)(2). ” 
This change would be the best approach to keeping the intent of LD #278 in place without the unintended 
consequences of invalidating any HSA plans.   
Finally, we would like to poin t out that, although the rate impact is small, it adds to the  already  high price 
of health insurance.  Small impacts tend to add up over time and being an unfunded mandate, it increases premium 
costs for policy holders .  Also,  it takes choice away from the individual policy holder and the employer who sponsors 
an insured group health plan  who, we believe , should be the ones who decide wh ich benefits they want to includ e 
in their plan.   
We would like to thank the Committee for considering our comments and the opportunity to express our 
views. If you have questions, please fe el free to contact me . 
Respectfully , 
 
Dan Colacino
