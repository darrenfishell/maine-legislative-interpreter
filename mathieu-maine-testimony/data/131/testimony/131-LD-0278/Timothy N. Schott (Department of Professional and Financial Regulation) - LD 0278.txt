Re: L.D. 0278, An Act to Require Health Plans to Cover an Annual Mental Health Wellness 
Examination 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee:" 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 0278. The purpose of this letter is to provide 
you with background information. This bill would require carriers offering health plans in the 
State to provide coverage for an annual mental health wellness exam. The requirements of the 
bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2024._ 
It is unclear whether this mandated coverage would be in addition to or instead of the current_ 
requirements of 4320-A. This section requires the ﬁrst behavioral health ofﬁce visit at no 
charge. After the ﬁrst behavioral health ofﬁce visit, the copayment amount for a behavioral 
health ofﬁce visit may not be greater than the copayment for a primary care ofﬁce visit. As 
currently worded, the bill is not clear what is to be included in such an exam and what 
qualiﬁcations providers should have who could give such an exam. 
Beginning in 2014, states were required to defray thecosts of all mandates that are included in 
Qualiﬁed Health Plans, unless those mandates are required as part of the essential beneﬁt 
package. The Affordable Care Act'(ACA) directs states to make payments either to the. 
individual enrollee or to the insurer.1 Generally, any mandate adopted by a state after December 
31, 2011 is subject to the requirement for the state to defray the additional premium cost of that 
mandate. However, if this bill is determined to be the expansion of an existing mandate rather 
than a new mandate, it is our understanding that the state would not have to defray the cost. . 
Title 24-A M.R.S. § 2752 requires a review and evaluation of a mandated beneﬁt proposal by the 
Bureau of Insurance before the bill may be enacted. These reviews include an evaluation of the 
ﬁnancial impact, social impact and medical efficacy of the mandate. If a report is requested it 
could cost the Bureau up to $13,500 for outside contract consulting work plus staff time, 
estimated at a cost of $1,600 to collect information, review consultant work, and prepare the ﬁnal 
report. We anticipate that current resources will allow us to conduct up to two studies during the 
current session, and-we will need eight weeks for each report to ensure a high-quality evaluation.
