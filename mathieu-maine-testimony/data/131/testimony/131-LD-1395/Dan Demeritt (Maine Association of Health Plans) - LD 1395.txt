Testimony of Dan Demeritt — 4/26/23 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
In Support of LD 1395 
An Act to Increase Transparency Regarding Certain Drug Pricing Programs 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Demeritt, the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, 
Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and United Health Care. Our private 
and non-profit insurance carriers provide or administer health insurance coverage to about 
600,000 Maine people. Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people 
by promoting affordable, safe, and coordinated healthcare. 
In a recent New York Times series, “Patients Over Proﬁts,” reporters looked at different practices 
employed by not-for-profit hospitals that stray from their charitable mission to increase revenue 
at the expense of patients. One of those stories highlighted how a major non-profit hospital 
system used the poverty of patients served by the Richmond Community Hospital in Virginia to 
tap into the 340B program. 
I share a portion of the reporting with my testimony. The full article from September 2022 can be 
found by following the link in the footnotes. ‘ 
This share is not to suggest malfeasance by Maine”s 32 non-proﬁt hospitals or diminish how 
important reasonable margins are to sustaining healthcare services? Nevertheless, this reporting 
demonstrates why transparency matters in a federal program established “to stretch scarce 
Federal Resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more 
comprehensive services. ”3

The Health Resource and Service Administration (HRSA) requires that covered entities adhere to 
its program integrity guiding principles including maintaining accurate records and participating 
in audits by manufacturers or the federal government.4 
Many providers also adhere to the American Hospital Association ’s (AHA) 340B Hospital 
Commitment to Good Stewardship Principles. The principles include communicating the 
program’s value, disclosing the savings, and committing to internal controls. ’ 
My testimony includes a Central Maine Medical Center posting based on the AHA’s Good 
Stewardship Principles. Even so, CMMC’s 2019 estimate 0f$l3.5 million in savings tells us 
little about how these savings were generated and how the dollars were invested. “ 
LD 1395 builds on the work hospitals must do to comply with HRSA guidance and AHA’s Good 
Stewardship Principles. It creates transparency and provides Maine consumers, purchasers, 
policymakers, and payors with new insights into the costs of prescription drugs and the ﬁnances 
ofMaine’s non-proﬁt hospitals. 
We urge a vote ofought to pass.

RICHMOND, Va. — In late july, Norman Otey Was rushed by ambulance to 
Richmond Community Hospital. The 63-year-old was doubled over in pain 
and babbling incoherently. Blood tests suggested septic shock, a grave 
emergency that required the resources and expertise of an intensive care unit. 
But Richmond Community, a struggling hospital in a predominantly Black 
neighborhood, had closed its I.C.U. in 2017. 
It took several hours for Mr. Otey to be transported to another hospit?

At the chain’ s St. Francis Medical Center, an Italianate-style compound ina 
suburb 18 miles from Community, golf carts shuttle patients from the lobby 
entrance, past a marble fountain, to their cars. 
In December, Bon Secours kicked off a $108 million construction project at St. 
Francis to expand its I.C.U. and maternity ward. Not long before that, Bon 
Secours broke ground on a free-standing emergency room that would be an 
extension of St. Francis in suburban Chesterfield County. The news release 
boasted that it would offer CT, M.R.I. and ultrasound imaging. 
Dr. Samuel Hunter, 81, who worked for more than four decades as a pathologist 
at Richmond Community until he left in May, said the disparity reminded him 
of his childhood in segregated Florida, where Black children like him learned 
from textbooks that White students had already used. 
“I know what it feels like to have secondhand things,” he said. 
A Lucraﬁve Drug 
Im age 
Cr¢’d1'!...S;zra/1/101/1/1/Izznqq//U70 Ncw lor/c Tfrrzc: 
When Bon Secours bought Richmond Community, the hospital served 
predominantly poor patients who were either uninsured or covered through 
Medicaid, which reimburses hospitals at lower rates than private insurance does. 
But Bon Secours turned the hospital ’s poverty into an asset. 
The organization seized on a federal program created in the 19905 to givea 
ﬁnancial boost to nonproﬁt hospitals and clinics that serve low-income 
communities. The program, called 3403 after the section of the federal law that 
authorized it, allows hospitals to buy drugs from manufacturers at a discount—
9
roughly half the average sales price. The hospitals are then allowed to charge 
patients ’ insurers a much higher price for the same drugs. 
The theory behind the law was that nonproﬁt hospitals would invest the savings 
in their communities. But the 340B program came with few rules. Hospitals did 
not have to disclose how much money they made from sales of the discounted 
drugs. And they were not required to use the revenues to help the underserved 
patients who qualiﬁed them for the program in the ﬁrst place. 
In 2019, more than 2,500 nonproﬁt and government-owned hospitals 
participated in the program, or more than half of all hospitals in the country, 
according to the independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. 
Starting in the mid-2000s, big hospital chains ﬁgured out how to supercharge 
the program. The basic idea: Build clinics in wealthier neighborhoods, where 
patients with generous private insurance could receive expensive drugs, but on 
paper make the clinics extensions of poor hospitals to take advantage 01:3/iOB. 
Since 2013, Bon Secours has opened nine such satellite clinics in wealthier parts 
of the Richmond area, according to federal records. Even though the outposts 
are miles from Richmond Community, they are legally structured as 
subsidiaries of the hospital, which entitles them to buy drugs at the discounted 
rate. 
The Bon Secours Cancer Institute at St. Mary’ s, for example, administers cancer 
drugs to patients in an oﬁice suite on the tree-lined campus of St. Mary’s 
Hospital. 
Thanks to 340B, Richmond Community Hospital canbuy a vial ofKeytruda, a 
cancer drug, at the discounted price 0f$3,444, according to an estimate by Sara 
Tabatabai, a former researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. 
But the hospital charges the privateinsurer Blue Cross Blue Shield more than
seven times that price -- $25,425, according to a price list that hospitals are 
required to publish. That is nearly $22,000 proﬁt on a single vial. Adults need 
two vials per treatment course.

The Way hospitals use the 340B program is “nakedly capitalizing on programs 
that are intended to help poor people,” said Dr. Peter B. Bach, a biotechnology 
executive and researcher whose Work has shown that hospitals participating in 
the 340B program have increasingly opened clinics in wealthier areas since the 
mid—200()s. 
Bon Secours did not disclose how much money it earned through the program, 
but said the funds “help us address health disparities while providing 
community support and outreach. ” It said it had provided nearly $18 million in 
Free care to poor patients at Richmond Community Hospital since 2018. In 
2020, the hospital provided $3.8 million in free care to low-income patients, or 
about 2.6 percent of its total expenses, slightly above the national average. 
The federal agency that oversees the 340B program, the Health Resources and 
Services Administration, said that hospitals and clinics were regularly audited, 
and that the Biden administration had proposed requiring them to report how 
they spent proﬁts generated through the program. Such a change would require 
congressional approval. 
In 2020, the most recent year for which data is available, Richmond 
Community Hospital — including its satellite ofﬁces — had a proﬁt margin of 
nearly 44 percent, the highest in the state, according to an analysis by Virginia 
Health Information, a nonproﬁt group that collects ﬁnancial data from 
hospitals. 
That year, the hospital brought in more than $110 million in revenue, after 
It?
expenses and losses were deducted, according to Virginia Health Information. 
According to two former Bon Secours executives Familiar with the hospital ’s 
ﬁnancial operations, the vast majority of Richmond Communitfs proﬁt since 
2013 has come from the 340B program. 
Bon Secours’ s other hospitals have not done as well. St. Mary’ s, considered the 
most prestigious Bon Secours facility in Richmond, brought in $83 million in 
2020.

On a sunny October day in Richmond in 2012, two cheerleaders for 
Washington ’s National Football League team smiled for cameras as they gripped 
a large sign between them. 
“Bon Secours Training Center,” read the sign, which combined the Bon Secours 
ﬂeur-de-lis logo with a bust of a Native American, the football team’ s logo at the 
time. 
The team, Bon Secours and the State of Virginia were unveiling a major 
economic deal that would bring $40 million to Richmond, add 200 jobs and 
keep the Washington team — now known as the Commanders — in the state 
for summer training. 
The deal had three main parts. Bon Secours would get naming rights and help 
the team build a training camp and medical offices on a lot next to Richmond ’s 
science museum. 
The city would lease Bon Secours a prime piece of real estate that the chain had

Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program 
the 3408 IS a program overseen by the Health Resources and Services Agency 
{HRSA), a civision otthe US Department oi‘ Health & Human Service. Under 3408, 
drug rnarritacturers vvho vvish to participate %n the Medicaid and Medicare PartB 
prewription coverage programs must offer a select list ofdrugs to qualified 
heaithcare providers at a reduced price. The program, which is not subsidized by 
the federai government, is intended to allow providers to stretch scarce resources 
as tar as pas;sible to provide more care to patients. 
Central Maine Healthcare (CMH) provides comprehensive, integrated healthcare 
services to a geographically dispersed population and qualifies for the 3408 
program enabiing us to provide additional services to our community. 
What 340B Means to CMH and Our 
Community 
FY19 Estimated Savings: $13,540,116 
iviany healihcare services are only partially covered by insurance or not covered at 
all. Medicare and i\/laine Care reimburse at rates that are often far below the actual 
costto provide care. Savings generated by the 3408 drug program help CMH ﬁll the 
reirnbursement gaps from insurance and also supports Ci\/lH's $5.2 Million offree 
care to needy community members annually. 
Examples of Programs Made Possible by 
340B 
- Reduced prescription costs: Our eiiilliated outpatient practice areas provide 
iovver costs for eligible medications at Cl\/ll\/lC ’s retail pharmacy and via mail
- Rural Areas: Bridgton and Rumford Hospitals provide full service 
chemotherapy and specialty infusion enabling patients to receive the care 
they need closer to home. 
- Central Maine Comprehensive Cancer Center: Located at the Levi/iston 
campus, our integrated, multidisciplinary cancer program combines a full 
spectrum oiiservices and medical specialists to diagnose and treat cancer 
holistically. 3408 savings enable us to provide access to the most up to date 
drug regimens for every patient vve see. 
- Diabetes & Endocrinology: Working collaboratively with patients, our team 
oi‘ board-certified endocrinoiogists, certified diabetes educators, registered 
dietitians along vvith other specialists create a personalized care plan for 
each individuai. 
Maintaining the 340B Program 
Ci\/li\/lC adheres to the American Hospital Associations 340B Good Stewardship 
Principles. We have an internal 3408 Oversight Committee comprised of key 
leadership members from across the healthcare system. The committee meets at 
least quarterly to conduct internal revievvs to ensure our program meets the US 
Department oi‘ Health & Human Services HRSA program rules and provide 
guidance for our program's future direction. 
Do I Need to Do Anything to Benefit? 
The 3408 program is not a direct to consumer program. The beneﬁts oithe 3405 
program for our community, such as those listed above, automatically apply to 
Ci\/lH patients who receive their care across our system. You do not need to do 
anything to take advantage ofthese beneﬁts. 
ityou value the types ofservices that this program makes available to our 
community by requiring drug manufactures to provide drugs to Cl\/iH at a discount, 
be sure to encourage your congressional representatives and senators to continue 
to support the federal 3408 program as an essential part of maintaining the 
availability ofexceptional care for Central, West, and i\/lid-Coast l\/laine.
