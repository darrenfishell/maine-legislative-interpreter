'\/like Tipping THE M/“NE SENATE 3 Stale House Station 
Senator. District 8 131st Legislature Augusta. l\/laine()-1333 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and esteemed members ofthe Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services: 
My name is Mike Tipping. I represent Senate District 8 in Penobscot County. I'm proud to present 
LD 1395, An Act to Increase Transparency Regarding Certain Drug Pricing Programs. 
The 340B Drug Pricing Program, established by the U.S. federal government in 1992, mandates that 
drug manufacturers supply outpatient drugs to eligible healthcare organizations, often referred to 
as “covered entities," at significantly reduced prices. The goal ofthe program is to help these 
organizations extend scarce federal resources, enabling them to serve more eligible patients and 
offer more comprehensive services. Entities beneﬁting from this program include health care 
providers that receive certain federal grants, such as federally qualified health centers [FQHCs), 
family planning clinics, and Ryan White HIV/AIDS program grantees, as well as certain types of 
hospitals that provide care to low-income, medically underserved individuals. 
There is no doubt that the 340B program is an important program. It provides critical support to 
many health care providers and entities serving low-income and medically underserved 
populations. However, legitimate concerns have been raised about whether the program is 
operating as intended. Earlier this year, the Maine Prescription Drug Affordability Board released a 
report ofrecommendations to reduce prescription drug spending in Maine, which included a 
recommendation "that the Maine Legislature require greater transparency and accountability for 
the 340B program in Maine," which is exactly what this bill aims to do.1 
Outpatient drugs purchased by covered entities through the 340B program are usually discounted 
by 20-50%, with an average discount of 34% off the Average Manufacturer Price [AMP]. Z However, 
discounts can be much higher, and in many instances, providers can purchase drugs for as little as 
one penny through the 340B program. The 340B statute states that the intention ofthe program is 
to "stretch federal resources as far as possible reaching more eligible patients and providing more 
comprehensive services." 
Some covered entities pass on 340B savings directly to their patients, while others may charge 
patients and third-party payers, such as private health plans, full price for 340B drugs. Covered 
entities can use proﬁts generated through the program “to expand the number of patients served, 
increase the scope of services offered to low-income and other patients, invest in capital, cover

administrative costs, or for any other purpose," since the federal 340B statute doesn't dictate or 
limit how covered entities use 340B revenue? 
Some covered entities that are federal grantees have restrictions on how 340B revenue may be 
used, such as FQHCs, which must use funds for purposes consistent with their federal grant 
requirements. However, hospitals don't have these requirements. 
Since the 340B program was first implemented, it has expanded to include more types ofproviders 
and to allow providers to contract with a greater number ofpharmacies to administer 340B drugs 
to patients. The Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA), which administers the 340B 
program, estimates 340B sales make up more 7% ofthe overall U.S. drug market/’= In 2021, covered 
entities spent nearly $44 billion on outpatient drugs under the 340B Program, ofwhich more than 
80% was spent by hospitals.5 As this program has expanded, concerns have been raised about how 
revenue is being used and whether it is working as intended 
A 2019 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office highlighted issues ofinsufﬁcient 
oversight of aspects of the 340B program, as well as the lack of information in hospital contracts 
about how hospitals meet obligations to provide health care services to low-income individuals ﬁA 
2018 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found there was no clear evidence 
that the 340B program had been associated with expanded care in hospitals or lower mortality 
among low-income patients? 
Without clear data, it is impossible to know how the 340B program is operating in Maine. Maine's 
hospitals are a vital part of our communities and provide needed medical care and services to 
thousands of Maine people every day. However, requiring transparency is prudent and necessary to 
better understand how this program is operating in Maine. The information being requested is 
already required to be compiled in the case ofa federal government audit and would not require a 
signiﬁcant administrative burden. 
This bill does not reduce hospitals ’ access to 340B discounts or limit in any way how hospitals use 
340B revenue. It only requires there be transparency so that we can better ensure this important 
program is operating as intended to benefit Maine people. 
Thank you for your consideration and l'm happy to answer any questions.
