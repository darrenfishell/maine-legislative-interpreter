Re: LD 1395 â€“ An Act to Increase Transparency Regarding Certain Drug Pricing Programs  
 
Senator Bailey , Representative Perry , and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance & Financial Services : 
 
This letter is to provide information in support of  LD 1395, An Act to Increase Transparency Regarding 
Certain Drug Pricing Programs .  
 
This bill requires ea ch hospital to provide an annual report to the Maine Health Data Organization with 
hospital data, drug data and contracting and vendor data related to its participation in the federal 340B drug 
pricing program. The Maine Health Data Organization must post the report on a publicly accessible website.   
 
Manufacturers participating in the Medicaid program provide a rebate to MaineCare and other Medicaid 
programs for covered drugs. The federal drug program under section 340B of the federal Public Health 
Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 256b requires drug manufacturers participating in the Medicaid program to also 
provide outpatient drugs to eligible organizations at significantly reduced prices. Drug manufacturers are not 
required to provide both a discounted 340B price and a Medicaid drug rebate for the same drug.  
 
As outlined in  the MaineCare Benefits Manual Chapter II, Section 90, Physician Services, 90.04 -7, Drugs 
Administered in the Office Setting,  MaineCare providers administering drugs must bill for acquisition c ost 
only. This allows the state to benefit from any discounts the provider received when purchasing a medication 
for our member. Requiring the provider to bill for acquisition cost only offsets the loss of drug rebates 
because , if a MaineCare provider buys  drugs at the 340B price, MaineCare cannot seek a rebate on that drug.  
 
The data reporting requirements in LD 1395 would improve drug pricing transparency and provide another 
mechanism for MaineCare to verify that we are not seeking drug rebates on drugs t hat were purchased under 
340B pricing . 
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If you have any 
further questions, please feel free to contact us. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert
