LD 1111
I am a newcomer to Maine. After many trips driving up past the “Welcome Home” 
signs posted at the border, we finally bought our own in Denmark in 2021. We hope 
and expect that it will be in our family for generations to come. 
The beauty and majesty of Maine is due in large part to its most precious resource – 
clean, pure, groundwater that feeds our residents, animals, plants, lakes, ponds, and 
streams. But it is currently being pumped and sold to the highest bidder by large-scale
extractors with a minimum of oversight. 
It is my hope that the amendments to LD 1111 will better protect our water by 
limiting water extraction contracts to a 3-year term and by creating a watershed 
approach to the process which acknowledges that water and aquifers do not know the 
boundaries of local towns and municipalities. In this way, when large-scale contracts 
are being considered, watershed area residents who may be affected can participate in 
the review process. 
On a personal note, we live on a beautiful, small pond in close proximity to an 
extraction point. We have been so saddened to see the decreasing water levels on the 
pond even in our short time in our community, and to learn of neighbors whose wells 
have recently begun to run dry. With climate changes causing both foreseeable and 
unknown havoc, it is more important than ever that we create mechanisms and laws 
that protect and prioritize our water resources for future generations.
