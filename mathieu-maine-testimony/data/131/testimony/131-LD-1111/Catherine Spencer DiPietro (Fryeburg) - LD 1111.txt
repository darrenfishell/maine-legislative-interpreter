Good Afternoon, 
I am Catherine Spencer DiPietro, P.E., an engineer of 40 years experience with 
water systems in Maine as well as other states and other countries. I am here to 
testify in Support of LD 1111 - An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreement for 
Large-scale Water Extraction. We in Maine are gifted with water - both surface 
waters and groundwaters. Nearly 550,000 Mainers use groundwater from private 
wells for drinking and daily use. Another 250,000 of our citizens obtain 
groundwater from non-community supplies such as schools, manufacturing 
facilities or campgrounds. A majority of the 1900 public water supplies in this state 
use groundwater sources. 
We talk about surface water and groundwater as separate entities, but they are 
inextricably bound together in the hydrologic cycle and they deserve equal 
protections. However, under current laws, surface waters are better protected from 
both pollution and overuse (over extraction) than groundwaters are. A potential 
beneÔ¨Åt of lD 1111 would allow local governments to proceed with caution 
regarding groundwater extraction within their jurisdictions. Conversely, without 
the protection of this legislation, a village or town could be bound to allow water 
extraction even if it is no longer in the best interest of the residents of that town. 
The gift of adequate water is not assured and should not be taken for granted - the 
drought of last summer revealed the vulnerability of individuals and communities 
to lack of water. LD 1111 is a step toward better stewardship of the gift of 
groundwater that all Maine citizens share and I urge you to support passage of this 
law in the House and the Senate.
