Hello
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Ziegler
and
EUT
Committee
Members,
My
name
is
W ill
Cunningham,
I
have
lived
in
Portland
Maine
my
whole
life
and
attend
college
at
UMaine
in
Orono.
I
am
writing
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1 1 1 1
“An
Act
Concerning
Contracts
and
Agreement
for
Lar ge-Scale
W ater
Extraction”.
Fresh
water
is
a
resource
that
is
absolutely ,
inar guably
necessary
for
life.
In
this
world
where
the
rapidly
changing
climate
is
bringing
instability
to
our
access
to
fresh
water ,
the
responsibility
we
have
as
Maine
residents
to
practice
good
stewardship
of
this
increasingly
rare
resource
is
steadily
growing.
A
mechanism
such
as
LD
1 1 1 1
would
help
ensure
that
responsible
stewardship
of
our
available
water
is
practiced
properly .
Contracts
that
last
for
long
periods
of
time
with
no
change
are
inflexible
and
limit
Maine's
ability
to
practice
community
resiliency .
The
permit
length
proposed
by
this
bill
would
allow
for
contracts
to
be
reevaluated
based
on
the
ever
changing
factors
of
our
climate,
encouraging
a
more
responsible
relationship
between
the
contracting
parties.
The
parties
most
af fected
by
the
bottled
water
industry
are
those
who
depend
on
the
water
source
being
siphoned
and
shipped
away .
It
is
only
common
sense
to
give
those
af fected
more
control
over
the
resources
they
depend
on
to
survive.
By
engaging
municipalities
that
are
accountable
to
locals,
this
bill
would
increase
our
representation
and
reduce
the
power
of
outside
influences
on
our
livelihoods.
Thank
you,
W ill
Cunningham
