Good Morning–  I have a camp and property on and near Long Pond in Denmark, 
Maine. 
I fully support LD 1111 “An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreements for 
Large-scale Water Extraction”
Long Pond in Denmark, Maine is a spring fed pond.  As there is minor surface water 
input, Long Pond depends on groundwater inflow to maintain its natural dimensions.  
These coldwater inflows were a primary reason for the State of Maine to invest 
several decades ago in restoration of the pond to create a self-sustaining wild trout 
population.  Any lowering of the water table near the pond could remove coldwater 
from deep in the pond where trout find refuge during the warmer months.
Lowering the water table around the pond is also detrimental to recreational uses of 
the pond and likely to depress property values because the water will become shallow 
and warmer; the sun would penetrate to a larger expanse of the bottom of the pond 
which in turn could very likely promote nuisance plant growth and possibly harmful 
algal growths.
A bulk water exporter is extracting groundwater from extraction wells located near 
the southern edge of Long Pond in Denmark.  The impacts of this water extraction are
uncertain at present and such uncertainty will no doubt persist with changing 
conditions in the future relating to climate, pumping rates, etc.
Renewing permits every three years is completely appropriate for groundwater 
extraction activities.  Extraction well permittees and their associated permitting 
agencies hold in their hands an enormous responsibility to protect Maine’s special 
ecosystems as well as protecting human health and welfare.  Three year permits will 
allow all stakeholders to make real time decisions under what we all know will be 
changing conditions of the future.
Thank you.
