LD 1111
Greetings Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and EUT Committee Members,  
My name is Peter Nilsen.  My wife Linda and I live at 33 Long Pond Drive, in 
Denmark, ME.  We are testifying in support of LD 1111 “An act concerning 
Contracts and Agreement for Large-Scale Water Extraction”. 
When large scale water companies come into small Maine towns, they come with 
their hydrogeologist and lawyers that are working for the water extraction company’s 
best interest.  Small towns cannot afford to hire their own hydrogeologist and lawyers 
that would put the town’s best interest ahead of the large company’s interest. This bill
LD 1111 could go a long way to equal the playing field. 
It is clear to see that Maine’s pristine water could be the next big resource grab!  
Therefore, we encourage you to vote YES on this bill to protect this resource for our 
future generations. 
 
Respectfully, 
Peter & Linda Nilsen
