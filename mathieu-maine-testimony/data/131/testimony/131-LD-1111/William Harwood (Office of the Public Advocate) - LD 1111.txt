 Testimony In Opposition to  
LD 1111, “An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreement for Large -scale Water 
Extraction ” 
March 30 , 2023 
 
Senator  Lawrence , Representative  Zeigler  and distinguished m embers of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities , and Technology,  
 My name is William Harwood  and I am the Public Advocate , submitting testi mony  in 
opposition to  LD 1111 , “An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreement for Large -scale 
Water Extraction .” 
 The OPA appreciates that large -scale water extraction is an issue that needs to be 
regulated. However, w e want to encourage water utilities to enter into arrangements  to sell 
water whenever it is cost effective to do so.  By selling water to a large user of wat er, a water 
utility has the opportunity to spread its fixed costs over a larger sales volume and thereby 
lower the  price of water paid by all other ratepayers. The additional regulations proposed in 
this bill may unreasonably limit the utility’s ability to  achieve this desirable result.  
Thank you for your time, attention , and consideration of this testimony. The Office 
of the Public Advocate looks forward to work ing with the Committee on LD 1111  and will 
be available for  the work session to assist the Committee in its consideration of this bill.  
 
Respectfully  submitted , 
    
William S. Harwood  
Public Advocate
