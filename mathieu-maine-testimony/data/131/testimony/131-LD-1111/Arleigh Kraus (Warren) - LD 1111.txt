LD 1111
In support of LD 1111 An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreements for Large Scale
Water Extraction
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee My name is Arleigh Kraus I am a registered cannabis caregiver with a 
B.S. in biochemistry, an organic farmer, and business owner in Warren. I am a board 
member of Maine based Citizens against Residential Mining Activities (CARMA).
I am here today to testify in support of LD 1111.  
The water deep in the aquifers under the soil and rocks of our state is not renewable.  
The water is finite.  Once it is gone it's gone.  Is selling off the water in our ground 
worth a CEOâ€™s bonus? Is it worth our future?  Is anyone paying attention or taking 
this seriously? There is no rationale by which selling water resources to a corporation 
makes any sense for the population of a state. Water is not a renewable resource.  It is 
not for the good of the people to let extractive corporations control the water and thus 
the very future.  It is for the profit of the very few.  
Our children deserve a future not a dustbowl.  
Please vote ought to pass LD 1111
Respectfully,
Arleigh A. Kraus
