Good morning, distinguished members of the State Legislature. My name is James Metivier and 
I am here to provide testimony on LD-1111 ,HP 707, An Act Concerning Contracts and 
Agreements for Large-scale Water Extraction. 
I am here today to urge you to take action on this issue. We have had family-owned property on 
the north end of Long Pond in Denmark since 1990.  We built a small cabin with my father, 
grandfather, and other family and friends.   I have seen firsthand the impact water extraction has 
had on our community. Originally, we had 2 sections of dock to access the pond.  In 2015 I had 
to add an additional 6 sections in order to access the water.  In 2021 and 2022, I was not able to 
access the water at all after June. 
This is not just a problem for a few individuals or communities, it is a statewide issue that affects 
all of us. It affects our economy, our environment, and our quality of life. It is time for us to 
come together and address this issue head-on. 
This legislation is a great first step that we can take to address this issue. With shorter contracts, 
this gives towns an opportunity to act quicker before a spring can affect ground water or to 
simply dry up entirely as has happened in the past. 
I understand that implementing these policies will require resources and cooperation from all 
levels of government, as well as the private sector. However, the cost of inaction is too high. We 
cannot afford to wait any longer to address this. 
In conclusion, I urge you to take action and support HP 707. We have an opportunity to make a 
positive impact on the lives of millions of people across our state, and it is our responsibility to 
take action. 
Thank you for your time and consideration
