Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1111, An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreements for Large -scale Water Extraction  
 
March 30, 2022  
 
 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and members of the Energy, Utilities and 
Technology Committee.  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony “neither for 
nor against” LD 1111 on behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to  serve on the 
Association’s Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of 
municipal interest.   
Municipal officials are torn on this issue.   
While local leaders recognize that water is a natural resource that is held in comm on, they 
remain concern ed that the provision in the bill requiring local legislative bodies (e.g., town 
meeting or council) in each municipality within the watershed to decide whether to award a 
contract will foster an environment that pits the interest s of one community against others .  As 
witnessed by the municipalities that have developed  and implemented large -scale water 
extraction ordinances, the process is very complicated, and the resulting contracts must be 
carefully negotiated .   
Although the provis ion in LD 1111 to limit the terms of water extraction contracts to 
three -years is viewed by some municipalities as requiring the companies who benefit from the 
sale of Maine water to give back to the community and region, municipal officials believe that 
the profession als hired to run water utility districts should continue to be entrusted with the 
authority to do what is best for the region’s watershed .  
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about the Association’s position on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at
