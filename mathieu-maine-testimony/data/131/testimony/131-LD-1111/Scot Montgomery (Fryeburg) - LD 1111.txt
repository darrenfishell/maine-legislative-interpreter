Greetings Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and EUT Committee Members,
My name is Scot Montgomery, I live in Fryeburg, ME and I am testifying in support of LD 1111 
“An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreement for Large-Scale Water Extraction”.
As a resident of Fryeburg and a past Trustee of the Fryeburg Water District I have seen up 
close the impacts of a lack of local control of the towns public water source.
Despite the overwhelming desire of the town to oppose the 45 year contract that was proposed 
by Nestle Waters and the Fryeburg Water Company and because of a lack of laws and rules the 
contract was approved. This was after the whole board of the PUC had to recuse themselves 
because of appearances of conflict of interest. This problem permeates the whole regulatory 
structure of the state and local governance. The amount of money spent to keep this situation 
unchanged is extraordinary. It is very difficult for small towns to go up against a huge 
Corporation with all the resources they employ.
Currently PFAS has been found in our water supply. How long it’s been there is unknown.
Large scale withdrawal is ongoing with no understanding the impact of this withdrawal on the 
aquifer.
The town has no say in the matter.
It’s time for change. 
I urge you to get serious about this issue.
Water is life
Thank you respectfully,
Scot Montgomery
