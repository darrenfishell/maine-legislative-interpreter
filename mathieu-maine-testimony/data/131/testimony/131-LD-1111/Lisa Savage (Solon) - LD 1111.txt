LD 1111
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and EUT Committee Members,
My name is Lisa Savage, I live in Solon, ME and I am testifying in support of LD 
1111 “An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreement for Large-Scale Water 
Extraction”.
Because ground water is not constrained by municipal or other political boundaries, 
science would suggest the wisdom of considering the watershed when rendering 
decisions about for-profit water extraction. This bill does that.
It also wisely limits extraction agreements to three years, with reconsideration of 
permits at that interval.
Failing to protect the vital resource of Maine's fresh water from exploitation could be a political
decision that future generations deeply regret.
