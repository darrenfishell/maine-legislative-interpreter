LD 1111
While I worry about the future of Maine's groundwater, especially in the face of 
climate change, I imagine that you will hear from people with more compelling 
backgrounds in science.  But what I find equally worrisome is LD 1111's core tenet: it
defines Maine as a legitimate target for extractive exploitation of a natural resource by
remote monied interests (eg, Nestle).  In short, it accepts a vision of Maine as a vassal
state.  Just as we should push back against those who would truck their toxic waste to 
Maine, we should resist industrial level extraction of what may be finite valuable 
commodities.  We deserve better.
