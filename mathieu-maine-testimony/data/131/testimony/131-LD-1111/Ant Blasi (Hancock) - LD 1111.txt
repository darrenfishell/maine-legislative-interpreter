 7   a. Natural flow from springs, Other Surface Sources, or Artesian Wells. If the proposed       extraction does not involve pumping water out of the ground or a surface water body,          but relies instead in whole or part on collection of water from a spring or surface source,        demonstrate that the flow remaining after removal of the water for transport will be        sufficient to maintain existing and designated uses of downstream surface waters,       particularly during periods of low-flow, including existing natural migration and        spawning of aquatic species, and that the classification of downstream surface waters       will not be affected.    b. Pumping from surface waters. If the proposed extraction includes pumping water out of           a surface water body, demonstrate that the flow and water levels remaining after removal      of the water for transport will be sufficient to maintain existing and designated uses of        upstream and downstream surface waters, particularly during periods of low-flow,        including existing natural migration and spawning of aquatic species, and that the        classification of upstream and downstream surface waters will not be affected.       Demonstrate that any changes in base flow resulting from reduction in pre-pumping         upstream or downstream flows will not adversely impact existing uses of groundwater or      groundwater classification.            c. Pumping of groundwater. If the proposed extraction includes pumping of groundwater,         submit a determination of the long-term safe yield of each well, including a prediction of      operating levels and determination of the zone of influence and zone of contribution for       each well. Provide a specific assessment, developed from monitoring of water levels and      flows during the pump tests, of the impacts on any existing wells and existing             groundwater flow paths within the zone of influence and zone of contribution for each       well, and on the impacts on baseflow volumes, potential for induced recharge,            maintenance of flow and surface water quality, duration of saturation in wetlands and        vernal pools, and other potential impacts on surface-water or groundwater quantity,        quality, and classification within the zone of influence and zone of contribution for each        well. Pump tests should include, at a minimum, the following:     i. Establishment of near-field and far-field monitoring wells, including nested wells       near springs, wetlands, and other surface waters in order to evaluate changes in       vertical flow due to the pumping, and background wells to document background       water levels in an area of the aquifer (or adjacent aquifer) that will not be        influenced by the test.           ii. Location and elevation of the monitoring wells relative to the existing well(s), to       the nearest 1 ft horizontal and 0.01 ft vertical.          iii. Measurement of elevation and distance from the pumping well(s) of springs,       streams, ponds, and wetlands shown on the site plan.          iv. Establishment of staff gages or pressure transducers in streams, ponds, open-water               wetlands, and other surface waters reasonably likely to be affected by pumping.          v.  Establishment of one or more precipitation monitoring stations.         vi.Two or more weeks of daily background monitoring at all stations.         vii. A stepped-rate pumping test to assess the hydraulic characteristics of the well or       wells to be pumped during the long-duration test.        viii. A long-duration pumping test at a reasonably fixed rate, to continue until        stabilization has been reached or for 5 days, whichever is less. Stabilization is        considered to be reached when the drawdown reading at either an observation well       no more than ten feet from the pumping well or the pumping well itself has not                  varied by more than 1/2 inch (0.04 feet) during the preceding 24-hour period. An        alternative definition of stabilization may be proposed by the applicant and must  
  
 8        be reviewed by the Planning Board or it’s designee and approved by the Planning        Board prior to the pumping test. The Planning Board may require longer-duration        tests if determined to be necessary to assess impacts to surface waters or other                wells.           ix. Monitoring of water levels at monitoring wells, surface waters, springs, and other        areas, at a frequency determined by the Planning Board or it’s designee and        approved by the Planning Board, during the pump tests and a recovery period no                    shorter than the duration of the test.    x. Records of precipitation during the pump test and recovery period, at a frequency        determined by the Planning Board or it’s designee and approved by the Planning                Board.           xi. Flows from the pumping well in gallons per minute.          xii. Uses and flows of nearby wells or other operations, such as construction         dewatering, in the vicinity of the pumping well or monitoring wells that could                affect groundwater levels during the test and recovery period.         8. GEOLOGIC CHARACTERIZATION. A report describing a conceptual hydrogeologic  model of the aquifer being considered and its recharge areas, including but not limited to:         a. Geologic Description. Description of the geology and geologic history of the area.           b. Cross-Sections.

This may include, but is not limited to, regular measurement and assessment of water level, water quality, streamflow, biomonitoring, wetland vegetation, amount and type of precipitation, and other sources of information as determined to be applicable to particular sites, depending on the presence and sensitivity of the resources, the proposed volume and method of extraction, and other relevant factors. This plan must include a provision for monthly submission of data to the Planning Board and Code Enforcement Officer, comparison of measured data to predicted values, and a plan to be implemented in the event that monitoring indicates the potential for adverse impact on surface-water or groundwater quantity, quality, and classification. If the data indicates adverse impact, upon notification by the Code Enforcement Officer to the applicant, the water extraction activities shall be discontinued. Before resumption of water extraction activity a hydrogeologic report prepared by a hydrogeologist certified to perform this type of work in the State of Maine and paid for by the applicant and approved by the Planning Board, shall 
 9 be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer and the Planning Board. Such report shall determine if the degradation was caused by the water extraction activity and shall also identify any remedial action necessary to restore the water quality or quantity to the conditions recorded in these wells during the test period. Such remedial action must be completed prior to resumption of the water extraction activity.        10. TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS.

The quantity of groundwater proposed to be extracted    will not adversely affect the long-term sustainability of the aquifer, groundwater resource    recharge areas, or other groundwater resources, during periods of drought or due to     reasonably anticipated changes in the recharge capacity of the affected groundwater    resources;          17. Sustainability of surface water characteristics. The quantity of groundwater to be extracted  will not adversely impact, significantly diminish, or alter the characteristics of any surface  waters, including during periods of drought;          18. Land subsidence. The quantity of water to be extracted will not cause any ground  subsidence on the parcel on which groundwater extraction is taking place or in the vicinity  of the parcel on which groundwater extraction activities are proposed;          19. Sustainability of water quality. The proposed extraction will not create a health risk or  create adverse impacts, such as drinking water turbidity, reduced clarity, or new odors  within existing groundwater resources from the disturbance of existing geologic materials  within the aquifer, or from any other cause related to the proposed groundwater extraction  activity;        20. Monitoring Plan. Adequate provision has been made to ensure that a monitoring plan  meets the requirements as described in Section 4.C.9; 
  
 14     21. Sustainability of preexisting domestic use of groundwater.

Agriculture does not include forest management and timber harvesting activities.   AQUIFER: An underground body of water and earth, sand, gravel, or rock that contains sufficient saturated permeable geologic material to hold, conduct and yield significant quantities of groundwater to wells and springs. The term "aquifer" as used in this article includes all areas specifically mapped or identified on the current maps issued by the Maine Geological Survey.  COMMERCIAL USE: The use of lands, buildings, or structures, the intent and result of which activity is the production of income from the buying and selling of goods and/or services.   DROUGHT: A period of abnormally dry weather that is sufficiently prolonged to cause serious hydrologic imbalance in the affected area. It is possible to index the severity of a drought by an impact grading system.   DWELLING: A building or portion thereof, used exclusively for residential occupancy, including single-family, two-family and multiple-family dwellings.  EXPANSION: An increase in the water extraction operation with regard to quantity of water to be extracted, change in number, location or configuration of wells, increase in traffic or increase in size of facility.  EXTRACTION POINT and EXTRACTION FACILITY: The physical location where groundwater is extracted from the ground by the use or development of springs, wells, pumps, piping apparatus, catchments, weirs or other extractive devices, methods or technologies.   GROUNDWATER: Underground water resources located at or below the water table and within the pore space of unconsolidated sediments or in fractures in bedrock. 
 19 HISTORIC OR ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCE: Any site, building, structure or object, significant in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering or culture, that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places (see 16 U.S.C.470w(5); 36CFR 60 and 800).   INDUSTRIAL USE: Use of a premises for assembling, fabricating, finishing, manufacturing, packaging, or processing.  These include but are not limited to assembly plants, laboratories, power plants, pumping stations and repair shops.  LARGE-SCALE WATER EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES: Extraction of 5,000 or more gallons of water from a single or multiple extraction points located within the Town of Hancock within any twenty-four-hour period by any individual, business association or entity, consortium or association of related individuals or related business entities for transport out of the Town of Hancock.    LEVEL OF SERVICE: A qualitative measure that incorporates the collective factors of speed, travel time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, safety, driving comfort and convenience, and operating costs provided by a highway facility under a particular volume condition, as established by the Institute of Transportation Engineer’s Transportation and Traffic Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition (or updates).  PUBLIC FACILITIES: Any facility, including, but not limited to, buildings, property, recreation areas, and roads, which are owned, leased, or otherwise operated, or funded by a governmental body or public entity  PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM: A public water system is defined at 40 CFR 141.2, in the Code of Federal Regulations and in the Maine Rules Relating to Drinking Water at 10-144E Chapter 231 Section 2. By this definition a public water system delivers water through a set of pipes for human consumption and has at least 15 service connections, or regularly serves at least 25 residents for 60 or more days per year.   TOWN: The Town of Hancock, Maine.  TRANSPORT or TRANSPORTING: To convey or carry from one place to another.   WATER BODIES or SURFACE WATERS: Lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands, and similar surficial water bodies.   WATER EXTRACTION: The taking, withdrawal, or removal of water from groundwater or surface water sources, including aquifers, springs, wells, lakes, ponds and streams, or the like, by the same individual or entity, or consortium or association of individuals or entities, regardless of the number of extraction facilities utilized.   WATERSHED or DRAINAGE BASIN: The area of land in which all precipitation (rainfall, snow melt, etc.) drains towards a single location or area and water body or watercourse. Ridges of higher ground generally form the boundaries between watersheds. At the linear boundaries of a drainage basin, precipitation falling on one side flows towards the low point of one drainage basin while precipitation falling on the other side of the boundary flows towards the single location or area and water body or watercourse of the adjacent drainage basin.    
  
 20  WATER TABLE: The level of the surface of groundwater or the water saturated zone within the underground substrate. The location of a water table is revealed by the level at which water stands in a well open along its length and which penetrates into adjacent groundwater resources.   ZONE OF CONTRIBUTION: The area of an aquifer that is capable of contributing groundwater to a well or other extraction point under the most severe pumping and limited recharge conditions that can be realistically anticipated, (i.e., 180 days of pumping at the maximum approved yield rate with no recharge of the groundwater resources from precipitation). A zone of contribution is bounded by groundwater divides which are evidenced by the pumping of the well and/or by the contact zones of supplying aquifers with adjacent low-permeable geologic materials such as glacial till or bedrock. Depending on local geologic and hydrologic conditions, surface water bodies, such as rivers, streams, wetlands, ponds or lakes, may act as recharge boundaries and define a zone of contribution. In all cases, a zone of contribution will extend upgradient within the related aquifer areas to the point of intersection of the aquifer with prevailing site-specific hydrogeologic boundaries such as a groundwater divide, a contact zone with low-permeable geologic materials, such as glacial till or bedrock, or a recharge boundary which may be demarcated by a surface water body.   ZONE OF INFLUENCE: The area surrounding a pumping well within which there are or will be physical changes in the water table due to groundwater relocation, extraction or withdrawal or the interruption of groundwater recharge conditions.

LD 1111
Dear Utilities Committee Members,
I am a Hancock County Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor, and 21-year
planning board member testifying as a private citizen.  LD1111 Ought to Pass.  If you
believe in Home Rule, a.k.a. Community's Right to Self-Governance, which begins 
with protecting its Ecosystems and Potable Water Supply, you should have no 
concerns about supporting LD 1111.  This means not just where the well is, but also 
in feeder municipalities of the watershed that yields the commercial well. LD1111 
rightfully places the decision to allow extraction and transportation of common water 
in the hands of these voters.  This vote should be by secret ballot in each municipality.
Perhaps a protocol for notifying these municipalities of the intent to draw their water 
on a commercial scale, as well as a definition of commercial extraction for export 
should be amended to the bill.  Additionally, a reminder of their rights to enact 
moratoria should be amended to the bill, to give their affected citizens ample time to 
prepare for their town votes and for the public meeting in 3.2.
Here is an excerpt from the Town of Hancock's Water Extraction Ordinance, which I 
participated in writing and enacting in 2011 and which I have attached:        
LARGE-SCALE WATER EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES: Extraction of 5,000 or 
more gallons of water from a single or multiple extraction points located within the 
Town of Hancock within any twenty-four-hour period by any individual, business 
association or entity, consortium or association of related individuals or related 
business entities for transport out of the Town of 
Hancock.  If each affected watershed municipality adopted this language, the net 
average daily commercial extraction might be justly regulated at the development site.
Who appoints water commissioners?  Why won't they recommend legislation to do 
what LD1111 does?  Please pass this bill to correct this. Thank you.
