LD 1111
     Bill 1111 is a step in the right direction if we have any interest in preserving the 
water resource we enjoy now.  We have to start a process of reclaiming what has been
given up. Millions of tons of water to be consumed from bottles that require twice the 
amount of water to make than the amount they hold, consumed in far away places as 
wells go dry.
Long term contracts are given to extraction companies whose shareholders don't live 
in the state and have no concern for the environmental effects, such as potential drops 
in surface water bodies and collapse of land above aquifers and undesirable changes 
to the natural filtering systems of these aquifers. 
Contracts are made regardless of the warnings of concerned citizens and these 
residents and their children are being ignored.  This bill calls for a review of 
extraction practices and their effects every three years.
