LD 1111
I urge you to pass LD 1111. 
At its core, this is a  public trust issue, which  encompasses the reserved and 
inalienable rights of citizens to a healthy environment. The principle imposes a 
sovereign duty on government to protect crucial natural resources for the benefit of 
present and future generations of citizens.
The 3 year limit is especially pertinent in light of climate crisis. Water is Life. please 
pass this bill.
