Water Extraction”.

Greetings Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and EUT Committee 
Members, 
 
My name is Marianne Hill, I live in  South Portland, ME and I am 
testifying in support of LD 1111 “An Act Concerning Contracts and 
Agreement for Large-Scale Water Extraction”. 
 
This is an extremely important piece of legislation, marking a critical step 
towards protecting a natural resource in Maine that is more valuable 
than oil - water. Water, a shared resource, is under threat from 
contamination, global warming and excessive extraction. Only the 
thoughtful stewardship of this resource by the state and by municipalities 
can ensure its adequate conservation for the future. 
 
Large-scale extraction of water can pose a significant threat to water 
aquifers. Contracts for the large-scale extraction of water, then, should 
be periodically re-examined in light of scientific findings.  A contract that 
lasts 45 years would be (and is) irresponsible.  A reassessment of 
contracts every three years as called for by LD 1111, in light of the state 
of local water tables and of the underlying aquifers, is more than 
reasonable. 
 
 
 All localities whose future is affected by the large scale extraction of 
water in their region should have a say about such extraction. LD 1111 
calls for public hearings, which would give concerned residents the 
knowledge they need to be able to act in protection of their water futures. 
 
In this era of global warming and climate change, the idea of ‘absolute 
sovereignty’ is obsolete. Consider water in light of global warming. Water 
vapor is the largest single greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and has 
been increasing by about 1 to 2% per decade due to rising global 
temperatures, according to the UN report on climate change. This added 
water vapor traps more heat, which “further warms the atmosphere, 
resulting in even more water vapor in the atmosphere. Scientists 
estimate this effect more than doubles the warming that would 
happen due to increasing carbon dioxide alone.”  Increasing 
desertification of agricultural land has been one result. The demand for 
water, then, will continue to rise, driving up its price. There will be more 
profit-seekers in the future wanting to capitalize on such rising demand - 
even at the expense of the long-term health of the economy affected.  
 
I strongly support LD 1111 and urge that you vote “ought to pass” in your 
report.  
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Marianne Hill, Ph.D., Economist
