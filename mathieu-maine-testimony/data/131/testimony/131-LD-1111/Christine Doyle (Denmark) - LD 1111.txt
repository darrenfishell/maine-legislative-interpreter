Greetings Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and EUT Committee Members,  
 
My name is Christine Doyle, I live at 895 Rocky Knoll Road in Denmark, Maine.  I am testifying in support 
of LD 1111 “An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreement for Large -Scale Water Extraction”.  
I currently have a well that is being affected by a large -scale extraction company. This company has 
stated that my well should not be affected by their extraction operation because they say that my well is 
out of the zone of  influence.  However, when they lost power for two and a half days and could not 
pump, the water level in my well increased by twenty -three inches, in a snowstorm with frozen ground.  
As I am a disabled person on a fixed low income with limited resources, I  find myself up against a very 
large water extraction company with near unlimited resources.  With the Absolute Dominion Law in 
Maine this company can take the water right from my well and in fact is taking the water from my well 
leaving me dry in the summ er. 
So please vote YES on this bill for people like me in Maine!  
Respectfully,  
Chirstine Doyle
