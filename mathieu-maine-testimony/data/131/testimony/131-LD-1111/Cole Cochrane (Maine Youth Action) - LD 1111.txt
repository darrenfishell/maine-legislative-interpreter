Senator
Lawrence,
Rep
Ziegler ,
and
the
honorable
members
of
the
Ener gy ,
Utilities
and
T echnology
Committee,
My
name
is
Cole
Cochrane,
I
am
a
senior
at
Thornton
Academy
in
Saco
and
I
am
here
on
behalf
of
Maine
Y outh
Action,
a
statewide
youth
advocacy
group
that
represents
hundreds
of
young
Mainers
from
varying
backgrounds.
W e
are
providing
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1 1 1 1,
an
Act
Concerning
Contracts
and
Agreement
for
Lar ge-scale
W ater
Extraction.
As
you
all
are
aware,
my
generation
will
be
facing
the
brunt
of
the
climate
crisis.
When
I
am
an
adult,
ef fects
from
climate
change,
such
as
food
and
water
shortages,
environmental
degradation,
increased
natural
disasters,
will
be
greatly
exacerbated
given
our
current
direction.
Therefore,
I
find
it
imperative
that
we
take
the
necessary
action
now
to
better
our
future…
my
future.
I
am
proud
of
the
work
Maine
has
done
in
many
respects;
for
example,
the
Maine
W on’ t
W ait
climate
action
plan.
Plus,
it
is
clear
that
one
of
the
utmost
priorities
for
our
state
is
environmental
and
natural
resource
protection.
As
a
clear
priority
for
the
public
and
the
future
health
of
our
state,
it
then
becomes
a
responsibility
of
our
decision
makers,
such
as
yourselves,
to
ensure
it
is
upheld.
This
is
what
makes
LD
1 1 1 1
essential.
The
current
process
of
water
extraction
agreement
in
Maine
is
reckless.
W e
allow
decades
long
contracts
to
be
secured,
which
strips
power
away
from
municipalities
and
those
in
impacted
communities.
This
results
in
limited
recourse
and/or
change
once
an
agreement
is
made.
Furthermore,
such
contracts
disempower
our
youth.
After
all,
securing
agreements
such
as
these
for
20,
30,
40
years
means
that
young
Mainers
now
won’ t
have
a
say
as
adults
over
water
extraction
in
their
communities.
This
creates
the
current
state
of
such
agreements
as
not
only

reckless
and
irresponsible,
but
also
undemocratic.
As
I
mentioned
earlier ,
young
Mainers
and
the
greater
part
of
our
state
emphasizes
the
need
for
climate
action
and
prioritizes
natural
resource
protection.
These
positions
that
we
hold
only
have
power
in
a
democratic
process,
which
is
what
ought
to
be
in
place
for
lar ge-scale
water
extraction.
I
believe
strongly
that
LD
1 1 1 1
achieves
that
purpose
with
a
sensible
approach.
By
restricting
the
terms
of
the
agreement
to
three
years,
as
well
as
requiring
local
approval,
LD
1 1 1 1
democratizes
the
process
and
empowers
individuals
to
advocate
for
responsible
and
sustainable
practices.
The
youth
of
our
state
will
be
impacted
the
most
by
the
decisions
you
make.
The
members
of
this
committee
will
be
deciding
whether
or
not
my
generation
has
the
protection
in
place
for
our
natural
resources.
I
encourage
all
of
you
to
vote
on
behalf
of
young
Mainers
today
by
voting
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1 1 1 1.
I
thank
you
for
your
time
and
service.
