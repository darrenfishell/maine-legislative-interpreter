LD 1111
LD 1111 is being submitted by concerned persons with no emphasis on whether they 
are one political party or another.  This is because the preservation and protection of 
the water for the humans, animals, agriculture, and economic benefits resulting from 
the Tourists who come to spend time on our rivers, lakes, and ponds is crucial and 
politics should not play a role!
- As we face changes in our climate, a mechanism such as LD 1111 would help to 
ensure responsible stewardship of water sources. Contracts that would last for 
prolonged periods are inconsistent with community resiliency goals and a 3 year 
maximum would encourage a more responsible relationship between contracting 
parties for accountable stewardship. 
- This bill addresses a gap in community resiliency planning by strengthening 
democratic self-governance as a guiding principle in community decision making. It 
also ensures accountability in the care of the groundwater sources (aquifers) we 
depend on. 
As Maine begins to grapple with PFAS and other residue of industry stemming from 
the storage and "disposal" of them more and more communities find themselves with 
poison in their soil and water.  
We must stop selling ourselves short, assuming that there will be ample healthy water,
and letting bulk water extractors take our most precious resource. LD1111, when 
juxtaposed with the USGS study of our state's practices with 4 others in the country 
will effectively prevent the current practice from continuing...hopefully before spring 
fed ponds (like Round Pond in Fryeburg and Long Pond in Denmark) are sucked dry.
Please support LD1111, Water is our most precious resource, we do not have an 
endless supply and we must help our communities retain the responsibility for theirs, 
each and every one of them.
