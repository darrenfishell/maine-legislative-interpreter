LD 1111
Good Afternoon Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and EUT Committee 
Members,
My name is Gwendolyn Forrest, and I live in Portland. I am testifying in support of 
LD 1111 “An Act Concerning Contracts and Agreement for Large-Scale Water 
Extraction”.
We are fortunate here in Maine to have abundant groundwater, which will be essential
in the decades ahead as the climate crisis worsens. We must be wise stewards of this 
vital resource. LD 1111 will help us do that by using a watershed approach, by 
strengthening democratic self-governance, and by minimizing the length of time of 
water contracts to 3 years (a contract duration that had long been Maine law until the 
last decade).
I aim to live in Maine for the rest of my life. I want us to manage the life-sustaining 
resource of water responsibility and with an understanding of our long-term health 
and wellbeing. LD 1111 will help get us on the path to do so.
Thank you for your attention to this issues.
