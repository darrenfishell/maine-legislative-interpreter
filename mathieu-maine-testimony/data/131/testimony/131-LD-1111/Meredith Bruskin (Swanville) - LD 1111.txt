LD 1111
Dear Senator Lawrence and Rep. Ziegler, and EUT Committee members.
I am Meredith Bruskin, FNP from Swanville Maine and I am writing in support of LD
1111 An Act Concerning Contracts  and Agreement for Large-Scale Water 
Extraction. I was very glad to hear of this bill. As you know, in this world of climate 
crisis we are so fortunate in Maine to have our water, and we need protective 
legislation to ensure accountability to local people who are affected by large-scale 
withdrawals from our aquifers for private profit. Given the current very outdated ( in 
my opinion) " Absolute Dominion" groundwater law, I have been looking for an 
update to a "beneficial use" or " reasonable use" law that will allow communities to 
have more control of water useage and protection. As you know, currently  there is 
exclusively 1 large corporate entity who does most of the large-scale extraction--the 3
year contract limitation would go a long way to protect Maine people from deals that 
risk our aquifers in the future. Thank you for your attention. Meredith Bruskin, 
Swanville, Me.
