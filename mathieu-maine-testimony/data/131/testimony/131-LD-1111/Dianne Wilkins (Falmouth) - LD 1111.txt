LD 1111
My family supports the proposed amendments to LD 1111 for the following reasons:
•Drinking water is a shared common basic necessity for all life on earth and should 
be viewed through the same common lens as the shared air we breathe, and not as a 
product to be sold for profits.  What laws exist to stop a for-profit takeover of more of
our aquifers in Maine?
•Allowing for-profit companies to extract water without defined limitations on the 
amounts extracted and for extended permit durations without periodic review and 
renewal of the contract substantially increase the risk of disastrous outcomes (dry 
wells, decreased property values, loss of wildlife etc) for thousands of people and 
livestock living in that watershed area.  I would argue that the proposed 3-yr permit 
period is still too long of a duration and would ask that it be amended to a yearly 
review and renewal vote.
•Requiring a vote and approval by all municipalities located in the affected 
watershed is important as these legislative bodies were elected and are responsible to 
act to protect and on behalf of their residents which includes not allowing residential 
sustenance drinking water resources from being sucked out from under individual 
properties.
•A public hearing is also necessary in order for the residence to participate in a 
decision that affects them and to inform their elected bodies of their needs.  
Please support this amendment  to LD111.
