Joint
Standing
Committee

T ransportation
Senator
Chipman,
Representative
Williams,
and
esteemed
colleagues
on
the
Committee
on
Transportation.
My
name
is
Grayson
Lookner ,
and
I
represent
part
of
Portland.
I’m
here
today
to
present
LD
1351
“Resolve,
to
Direct
the
Department
of
Transportation
to
Create
a
Program
to
Promote
Transit
and
Transportation
Research
and
Funding.”
This
is
a
bill
I
am
presenting
on
the
behalf
of
a
constituent
who
has
some
innovative
ideas
for
how
we
can
create
better
transportation
systems
for
the
future.
We
need
to
be
looking
for
new
and
innovative
solutions
for
how
to
get
around
our
great
state.
For
too
long,
our
Transportation
system
has
been
focused
almost
entirely
around
the
automobile,
and
sometimes
with
unintended
consequences.
Cars
are
great,
and
oftentimes
convenient,
but
they
are
also
dangerous,
polluting,
and
expensive.
We
spend
hundreds
of
millions
every
year
to
try
to
keep
up
with
crumbling
infrastructure
for
cars
only.
Driving
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
activities
we
engage
in
every
day,
and
hundreds
of
Mainers
die
or
are
seriously
injured
annually
in
automobile
accidents.
If
we
as
a
state
are
serious
about
addressing
the
climate
crisis,
and
creating
solutions
to
the
housing
crisis,
and
keeping
our
streets
safe,
we
need
to
find
new
solutions
for
how
to
get
around.
Research
funding
is
necessary
to
provide
solutions
that
are
tailored
to
the
unique
challenges
and
opportunities
that
our
state
presents,
and
this
bill
would
direct
the
Maine
Department
of
Transportation
to
help
administer
federal
and
state
grants
and
funding
to
individuals
and
entities
that
conduct
transportation
research
that
could
revolutionize
how
we
travel
in
Maine.
Sometimes,
to
look
for
inspiration
for
the
future,
it’s
best
to
look
to
the
past.
For
decades,
it
was
possible
to
get
around
the
state
of
Maine
using
our
extensive
train
network,
including
the
District
131:
Part
of
Portland

“Portland-Lewiston
Interurban”
that
was
a
fully
electric
train
that
operated
between
Portland
and
Lewiston
between
the
years
of
1914
and
1933.
[1]
If
it
was
possible
then,
it
is
possible
today .
This
bill
is
not
specifically
about
electric
trains,
but
that
is
one
example
we
can
look
to
demonstrate
how
far
we
can
go.
I’d
hate
to
think
that
Maine’ s
most
advanced
transportation
systems
existed
a
century
ago.
We
need
a
vision
for
how
we
can
move
our
state
(literally
and
figuratively)
forward.
I
understand
that
my
constituent
has
some
proposed
amendments
for
this
bill,
some
of
which
are
admittedly
over
my
head,
as
I
am
not
an
engineer .
I’d
like
for
the
committee
to
listen
to
his
ideas,
and
incorporate
those
that
the
committee
deems
fit
into
the
bill
I
am
presenting
to
you
currently .
That
concludes
my
testimony ,
and
I
hope
the
committee
votes
to
pass
this
bill.
Thank
you,
and
I’m
happy
to
answer
any
questions.
