Resolve, Directing the Department of Health and Human Services to Apply for a Waiver from 
the Federal Government for the Medicaid Limitation on Payment to a Facility with More Than 
16 Inpatient Beds for Psychiatric Treatment LD 445
     Members of the Health and Human Services Committee; thank you for you time in 
listening to my testimony IN OPPOSITION TO LD 445
My name is Joe.  I am a resident of Hiram and a person with lived experience. 
I disagree with this bill as stated above because another hospital will just sit unstaffed, and 
waiting lists, and extended Emergency Department visits will not change. Putting bandaids on
rashes will not cure a rash and heal it so it heals and goes away. 
The answer is found in bills and policies that promote community resources within 
communities as healing occurs. 
I speak to this from lived experiences of having  sought "traditional" services, which ended up 
being not equipped to provide the help I needed to get beyond crisis and trauma effectively.   
Going to the Emergency Department to get on a waiting list for an inpatient psychiatric bed at 
a psychiatric hospital is not a solution. Building more institutions is not a solution because 
sometimes people don’t need the Emergency Departments, or psychiatric institutions, or 
Crisis Stabilization Units but alternatives to “traditional” mental health services. 
Until alternatives, like LD 540,  exist, this "crisis” of  the mental health system will not subside 
to a manageable proportion whatsoever. Getting help doesn't need to be this hard or 
traumatizing. 
Thank you for your time. This is why I oppose this bill and urge you to vote OUGHT NOT TO 
PASS.
