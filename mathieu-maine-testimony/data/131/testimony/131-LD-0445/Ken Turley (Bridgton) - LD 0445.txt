LD 445
I write this in support of LD 445. As a family member of a loved one with a serious 
brain illness, I have personally witnessed the effects of the IMD Exclusion when 
desperately trying to get care for our loved one. The waiver to provide services in 
IMDs is available to us in Maine.  Maine has accepted it for only substance abuse, but
not for brain disorders. This is a failing and neglect of a portion of our population that
is in need. It is time to support those who are in need of services that have been 
unavailable to them because of the IMD Exclusion Waiver. Brain Illness is the ONLY
illness that is excluded from care like this, which is a blatant discrimination against 
those in need. Please pass LD 445.
