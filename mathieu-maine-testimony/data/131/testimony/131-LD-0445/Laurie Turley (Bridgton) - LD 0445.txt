LD 445
I'm writing in support of LD 445. Maine has accepted the IMD Exclusion Waiver but 
only for substance abuse disorders, not for those who suffer from brain illnesses 
which may require hospitalization, and/or progressive treatment plans, which this 
waiver can also be used for. This is a blatant neglect and discrimination against those 
who are in serious need. The waiver is available for both populations. Please support 
accepting this waiver and stop the needless wait times and lack of care of those in dire
need. Pass LD 445. Thank you for your time.
