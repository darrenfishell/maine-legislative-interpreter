TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF LD 445 
CHAIRPERSONS BALDACCI AND MYER AND OTHER DISTINQUSHED MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. MY NAME IS JOE H. PICKERING JR. 
IN THE MAINE SUNDAY TELEGRAM MY LETTER APPEARED WITH THE BYLINE: THERE IS A CURE FOR 
CROWDED HOSPITALS. LD 445 IS THAT CURE. IT CAN BRING MUCH MORE THAN PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT 
SERVICES SUCH AS COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE PROGRESSIVE TREATMENT SERVICES. MAINE WILL 
RECIEVE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THESE VARIOUS SERVICES. 
PLEASE READ AND HEED THE MESSAGE OF MY LETTER. MAINERS SHOULD NOT DIE NEEDLESSLY THROUGH 
THE INACTION OF OUR STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NO MORE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES OR 
WATCHING TV DRAMAABOUT THE DEATH OF SOMEONE'S CHILD'S OUT OF THEIR MIND'S DEATH. PLEASE 
SUPPORT LD 445 
IN THE SPRING OF 1993 MY WIFE AND I WERE WATCHING OUR LATE SON CHRISTOPHERAND HIS BANGOR 
HIGH TEAM PLAY THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST SOUTH PORTLAND WHICH BEAT BANGOR IN 1992 
IN ATERRIFIC 5 TIME OVERTIME GAME. THE BANGOR TEAM WANTED "BASKETBALL REVENGE." THEY GOT IT. 
THE ANNOUNCER REPORTED CHRIS PUT ON A ONE-MAN SHOW INCLUDING BEING THE HIGHEST SCORER. 
OUR HEARTS WERE SOARING. LITTLE DID MY WIFE THERESAAND I KNOW THAT IN A FEW YEARS THE EVIL 
FLOWER OF SCHIZOPHRENIA WOULD BLOSSOM IN HIS HEAD FROM THE BODY CHANGES THAT THIS HOROR 
BRINGS IN YOUNG ADULTS. TRAGICALLY, OUR SOCIETY AND FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT CRUELY 
WORSENS BY UNDERFUNDING, FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS "REAL" ILLNESSES LIKE A BROKEN ARM 
AND LARGELY MAKING JOKES ABOUT THEM. 
THIS IS HOW FUNNY SEVERE SCHIZONPHRENIA IS: FOR 16 YEARS CHRIS AND OUR FAMILY 
LIVED WITH THIS 24/7 HORROR. HE GREW PROGRESSIVELY 
WORSE. SHORTLY, BEFORE HE DIED IN A HOUSE FIRE, CHRIS TOLD ME PUTIN 
HAD DIED AND HAD FLOWN TO PLUTO AND OTHER PLANETS AND THAT HE 
CHRIS HAD DONE THE SAME. DOES THAT SOUND LIKE HE OR ANYONE COULD 
MAKE SOUND LIFE DECISIONS? A NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION CALLED 
ANOSOGNOSIA HAD SET IN WHICH MADE HIM UNAWARE OF HIS OWN 
ILLNESS.THIS CONDITION IS COMMON IN SCHIZOPHRENA (51 %) AND OTHER 
SERIOUS BRAIN DISORDERS INCLUDING ALZHEIMIERS AND DEMENTIA WHERE 
SOMEHOW SOCIETY ACCEPTS THOSE TWO.) PLEASE SUPPORT LD 445! 
POINTS: 
1. SOME MIGHT SAY THIS BILL MIGHT VIOLATE THE AMHI CONSENT DECREE 
HOW? BY BRINGING MORE INPATIENT AND COMMUNITY SERVICES TO MAINE 
PAID BY THE FEDS???....
FACT: THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CREATED IN 2019 THIS WAIVER PROGRAM. 
OTHER STATES THROUGHOUT THE U.S AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT 
HAVE WAIVER PROGRAMS IN BOTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND "MENTAL 
ILLNESS" 
2. GOV MILLS THROUGH DHHS WAS WISE TO APPROVE AWAIVER PROGRAM 
FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE A FEW YEARS AGO BUT NOT A WAIVER FOR "MENTAL 
ILLNESS." BOTH ARE CO-OCCURING DISORDERS BOTH ARE CONSIDERED 
"MENTAL ILLNESS." THIS TERRIBLE DISCRIMINATORY INCONSISTENT POLICY 
HARMS THOSE WITH BRAIN DISORDERS AND ROBS THE MAINE TAXPAYER OF 
MILLIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDS. PLEASE PASS LD 445! 
3. I HAVE WORKED AND ADVOCATED IN MAINE SINCE 1979 FOR THOSE WITH 
SERIOUS BRAIN DISORDERS: FACT THE AMHI CONSENT DECREE OFTEN 
FAILED BECAUSE COMMUNITY SERVICES WERE UNDERFUNDED. FACT: LD 445 
BRINGS FEDERAL FUNDS FOR NEEDED COMMUNITY SERVICES! 
4. STATE LEGISLATURE MAKE THE MAINE STATE TAXPAYER HAPPY. BRING 
MILLIONS TO MAINE AND END THIS CONGRESSIONAL DISCRIMINATION. LET'S 
GET OUR FEDERAL SHARE OF FUNDS. REMEMBER SINCE 1965 NOTA NICKEL 
OF FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE COME TO MAINEII 
5. STATE LEGISLATURE MAKE THE MAINE STATE TAXPAYER HAPPY. BRING 
MILLIONS TO MAINE AND END THIS FEDERAL DISCRIMINATION IMPOSED 
BY THIS INSTITUTE OF MENTAL DISEASES EXCLUSION LAW SINCE 1965!! PASS 
LD 445! 
PLEASE READ MY MAINE SUNDAY TELEGRAM LETTER BELOW: 
IÂ»: I21.-; _ Posted Yesterday at4:00 AM INCREASE FONT SIZE P5: 
Letter to the editor: There isa 
cure for crowded Maine 
hospitals 
A law denying appropriate care to people with psychiatric disorders 
fills hospital beds and ERs. Passing L.D. 445 would change that.
