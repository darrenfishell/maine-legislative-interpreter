I am a mother of an adult son diagnosed with schizophrenia who has lived with this 
monster of an illness for 29 years now.  He struggles every day with a physiological, 
brain based illness.  He no more chose to have this illness than another would choose 
cancer.  It affects every aspect of his life.  People with serious brain disorders have 
been marginalized and discriminated against for years, by health care, by being 
judged as unworthy of medical care provided to everyone else with a diagnosis other 
than a brain disorder, and by society in general.  One example of completely 
unjustified discrimination is the federal IMD exclusion.  Blatant discrimination since 
this exclusion became part of the federal Medicaid program in 1965, mandating that 
states rather than the federal government have primary responsibility for funding 
inpatient psychiatric services.  This is so unfair, and so often prevents those who 
desperately need psychiatric hospitalization from receiving adequate and appropriate 
care, both in patient and in the community.  Please, please join other states who have 
already approved waiver of this unjust and inhumane discrimination of those with 
serious brain disorders.  We all need to be the voice and the conscience of those who 
have lost their voice because of their devastating diagnosis.  Please support L.D. 445, 
PLEASE!  Passing this bill will literally save lives, my family member and most 
possibly yours.  Thank you for your support and compassion.
