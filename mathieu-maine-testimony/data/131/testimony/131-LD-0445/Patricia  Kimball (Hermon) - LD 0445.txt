Good Afternoon Co-Chairs Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and 
Human Services Committee.  I am here today to testify in favor of LD 445 the Resolve, Directing the 
Department of Health, and Human Services to Apply for a Waiver from the Federal Government for 
the Medicaid Limitation on Payment to a Facility with more than 16 Inpatient Beds for Psychiatric 
Treatment.  
My name is Pat Kimball and I am retired from working in the field of substance use disorders and 
mental health for over 30 years.  This bill is requesting that the State of Maine apply for a waiver 
from Medicaid regarding the regulation referred to as the Institute for Mental Disorder or IMD.  This 
regulation and the impact of this is very familiar to me as for the last 10 years of my work I was the 
executive director of two facilities that were regulated and limited by the IMD. I can share with you 
today that if I could have just expanded my program by 3 or 4 beds lives would have been saved, 
and we would have been able to decreased our wait lists.  This Medicaid regulation is outdated, is 
not based on current best practice or research, and needs to be eliminated. There are many working 
nationally to change and eliminate this rule but in the best interest of Maine citizens who have a 
mental health disorder or brain disorder this waiver is the quickest way to improvement access to 
treatment. 
I am very grateful that the State of Maine in 2020 took a courage step in applying for a waiver for the 
IMD but did so only for substance use disorder treatment programs. Although it was an excellent 
decision, I think it need to include mental health. This waiver request  would expand to include 
mental health.   I do not fully understand why mental health was left out of the first waiver but at this 
point it does not matter, what does matter is that we apply for another waiver which would include 
mental health treatment. 
For the past two years I have been working with a group who is trying to breakdown the wall of 
discrimination and increase access to treatment for those who have a brain disorder.  In my research 
I came across this  paper that I think describes well the reasons that the IMD exclusion is no longer 
helpful to those in need of treatment.  I have included some of the findings of this report and would 
encourage you to review it.

Illness Discrimination by The Office of Research & Public Affairs in August of 2016.  These 
are exact exerts from this report. 
SUMMARY
The Medicaid Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion is an outdated, discriminatory federal 
rule that creates significant barriers to treatment for adults with severe mental illness. Under this 
rule, Medicaid payments to states are prohibited for non-geriatric adults receiving psychiatric care in 
a treatment facility with more than 16 beds.
Even with recent advances in mental health care afforded by the Affordable Care Act and federal 
parity legislation, the IMD exclusion remains the only section of federal Medicaid law that prohibits 
federal payment for medically necessary care simply because of the type of illness being treated. 
This categorically discriminatory rule is a leading cause of our national psychiatric hospital bed 
shortage and directly contributes to a host of negative consequences for those with the most severe 
mental illnesses.
BACKGROUND
The IMD exclusion was included in the law when Medicaid was enacted in 1965. At the time, there 
was hope that large inpatient facilities would be quickly rendered obsolete by advancements in new 
antipsychotic medications that allowed some people with serious mental illness to live safely in the 
community for the first time. The reasoning behind the IMD exclusion prohibiting reimbursement was 
thus twofold: disincentivize the treatment of the mentally ill in large institutions and shift the costs for 
psychiatric treatment from the federal government onto the states.
IMPACT
The economic impacts of the IMD exclusion have also been tremendous. While it does cost money 
to provide inpatient treatment to individuals with mental illness, cost savings from restricting inpatient 
care is largely an illusion. Studies show that short-length hospitalizations of individuals in psychiatric 
crises are associated with higher rehospitalization rates. In fact, a study by the federal Agency for 
Health Research and Quality within HHS found that, for Medicaid patients, mental illness conditions 
were two of the top three causes of 30-day inpatient readmissions. Along with diabetes, these three 
conditions resulted in approximately $839 million in hospital costs in 2011 alone. Also costly are the 
forensic beds, jail and prison cells and homelessness services that become the default care sites for 
individuals in need when a bed is not available
CONCLUSION:
The IMD exclusion is a discriminatory federal rule that prohibits federal Medicaid reimbursement to 
states for adult patients receiving mental health or substance abuse care in a psychiatric or 
substance abuse treatment facility with more than 16 beds. The IMD exclusion is the only section of 
federal Medicaid law that prohibits federal payment to help states cover the cost of providing 
medically necessary care to Medicaid beneficiaries.
The IMD exclusion has greatly contributed to the nationâ€™s psychiatric hospital bed shortage, which 
results in non-treatment of acute and chronic serious mental illness and the innumerable bad 
outcomes resulting from non-treatment. While significant steps are being made at the federal level to 
reform the IMD exclusion, a full repeal that extends to all Medicaid beneficiaries and without arbitrary 
inpatient-day limitations, will ultimately be necessary to address these issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------I In my community I hear daily the concerns about mental health and the impact it has on our 
lives and our safety.  We have a current system with more road blocks to treatment than we do open 
doors.  This bill gives Maine the opportunity to open doors, to increase access to much needed beds 
and to ensure our citizens are receiving care that will improve their lives not end them.    I leave you 
with one question, if the expansion was a good idea for substance use disorders why is it not a good 
plan for those who have a mental illness? Thank you very much for your time and I would be happy 
to speak with you or answer any questions you may have.  Please consider voting for this bill to 
move forward.
