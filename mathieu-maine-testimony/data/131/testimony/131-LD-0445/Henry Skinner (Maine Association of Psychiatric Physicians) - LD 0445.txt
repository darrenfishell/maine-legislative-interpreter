he purpose of this letter is to announce opportunities to design innovative service delivery systems, 
including systems for providing community- based services, for adults with a serious mental illness 
(SMI) or children with a serious emotional disturbance (SED) who are receiving medical assistance, 
as mandated by section 12003 of the 21st Century Cures Act  (Cures Act).i  Section 12003 of the 
Cures Act also mandated that this State Medicaid Director (SMD) letter include opportunities for 
demonstration projects under section 1115(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) to improve care for adults with SMI or children with SED (referred to throughout this SMD letter as this “SMI/SED demonstration opportunity”).  Improving care for beneficiaries with SMI or SED is a top priority for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  With this SMD letter, CMS hopes to enhance our work with states to i mprove care for Medicaid beneficiaries with serious mental health 
conditions.  Th is SMD letter is comprised of the following two parts:

he Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has defined “adults 
with a serious mental illness” as persons, age 18 and over, who currently, or at any time during the past year, have had a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria, that has resulted in functional impairment which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities.
ii  Major life activities include activities of daily living  (e.g., 
eating, bathing, dressing), instrumental activities of daily living  (e.g., maintaining a household, 
managing money, getting around the community, taking prescribed medication), and functioning in social, family, and vocational/educational contexts.
iii  An estimated 10.4 million adults in the United 
States had an SMI  during the past year in 2016, but only 65 percent received mental health services in 
that year (and this rate of treatment remained about the same between 2008 and 2015).iv

SAMHSA has defined “children with a serious emotional disturbance” as persons from birth up to 
age 18, who currently, or at any time during the past year, have had a diagnosable mental, behavioral, 
or emotional di sorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria that resulted in functional 
impairment which substantially interferes with or limits the child’s role or functioning in family, 
school, or community activities.v  “Functional impairment” is defined as difficulties that substantially 
interfere with or limit a child or adolescent from achieving or maintaining one or more 
developmentally -appropriate social, behavioral, cognitive, communicative, or adaptive skills.vi 
 
Mental health disorders usually first  arise in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood with 50% of 
people with mental health conditions  having experienced those conditions  by age 14 and 75% by age 
24.vii  Approxima tely 13% –20% of children and adolescents  living in the United States experienc e a 
mental disorder in a given yearviii and nearly half of children under age 21 who qualify for Medicaid 
based on a disability have a behavioral health condition.ix  Rates of unmet need for treatment are high 
among  children and adolescents; only about  half of  all children with emotional or behavioral 
difficulties receive mental health services ,x and only 41 percent of the 3.1 million adolescents who 
experienced depression  over the past year in 2016 received treatment.xi      
 
Serious mental health conditions ca n have detrimental impacts on the lives of individuals with SMI or 
SED and their families  and caregivers .  Since these conditions often arise in adolescence or early 
adulthood, individuals with SMI or SED are less likely to finish high school and attain hi gher 
education, disrupting education and employment goals.
xviiixii  Prior research has found a gap of ten years 
or more between the first onset of symptoms and initiation of treatment .xiii  Adults with SMI 
comprise about half of the individuals under 65 who are dual ly eligible for both Medicare and 
Medicaid , and those with SMI are the costliest subgroup among the se younger dual eligibles .xiv  
Furthermore, a dults who are incarcerated and homeless have high rates of SMI .xv  Individuals with 
SMI often have co -morbid physic al health conditions and substance use disorders (SUDs) ,xvi and t hey 
die on average 8 years younger than the general population.xvii  Suicide, which can be associated with 
mental health disorders , has been increasing in nearly every state, with increases of ov er 30% in 
over half of the states since 1999.xix   
 
I.  Strategies under Existing Authorities to Support Innovative Service Delivery Systems for 
Adults with SMI and Children with SED  
 
Earlier Identification and Engagement in Treatment 
 
Critical strategies fo r improving care for individuals with SMI or SED include earlier identification 
of serious mental health conditions and focused efforts to engage individuals with these conditions in 
treatment sooner , as highlighted in another  recent CMS SMD letter .xx  Some  approaches discussed 
below for encouraging earlier identification of and engagement in treatment for serious mental health 
conditions include support for development of referral networks to mental health providers including 
through improved connections and data -sharing capabilities linking  non- specialized health care 
settings and community organizations with mental health providers.  Another approach to support 
earlier identification and engagement in treatment is support for increased screening for mental health 
conditions and improved access to mental health services through  schools. 
 
Page 3 –State Medicaid Director  
 
One reason that earlier identification and engagement in treatment is cr itically important is that recent 
research studies have found that  adolescents and young adults with psychosis can have significantly 
elevated risks of mortality in the first year after diagnosis .xxi  One study pointed to a significantly  
elevated risk of suicide in particular during the first year after a diagnosis of psychosis as well as  
following a first recorded diagnosis of major depression.xxii  Both studies concluded that these 
findings point to the importance of assertive outreach and engagement as soon as possible after a n 
adolescent or young adult is first diagnosed with a serious mental health condition.   
 
As highlighted in an informational bulletin jointly issued by CMS, SAMHSA, and the National 
Institute of Mental Health, the Coordinated Specialty Care Model is a n evidence -based model of care 
designed to help identify and engage adolescents and adul ts with SMI , specifically psychosis, as soon 
as possible  in treatment with specialized mental health providers, e.g., community mental health 
clinics .xxiii  This model takes a multidisciplinary, team- based approach to providing comprehensive 
services as soon as possible after a person first experiences psychosis.  The package of services in 
this model includes outreach by providers to cultivate referral networks and engage with patients , 
families , and caregivers  as early as possible, coordinati on of services am ong treatment team 
members, clinical supervision, medication and medication management, psychotherapy, case 
management, coordination with primary care, family /caregiver  support and education, and supported 
employment and supported education.  The  Joint Inf ormational Bulletin referenced above describes  
the component services that make up this model and how these components can be reimbursed.xxiv  
There are also similar care models for children  at clinically high risk f or SED  and adolescents and 
young adults  at high risk of SMI that incorporate comprehensive mental health care, family 
education, medical care, and strong supports to keep children, adolescents, and adults  engaged in 
school and/or employment.xxv   
 
Lack of coverage of the costs of outreach to engage beneficiaries in treatment and develop referral 
networks has been identified by providers and advocates as an impediment to broader implementation 
of these care models .  However, s tates may be able to factor costs  of some outreach activities , 
including pati ent engagement  related to delivering a Medicaid covered service, into provider payment 
rates even though those activities are generally not separately reimbursable unless specified under a 
service definition.  Activities by providers to engage beneficiarie s in treatment including by 
developing relationships with hospitals to improve coordination and transitions out of inpatient care 
may be more specifically coverable under the optional Health Home state plan benefit under s ection 
1945 of the Act .  This opti onal state plan benefit includes  care coordination, transition care, or 
individual and family support services  and is discussed in more detail in Appendix A . 
 
Individuals with SMI or SED are often first identified as needing treatment for SMI or SED  in 
settings other than specialized mental health care settings including schools, hospitals, primary care, 
and criminal justice systems.  Connecting these other settings with local mental health providers can 
help improve access to treatment and rehabilitative s ervices as soon as possible after a serious mental 
health condition has been identified.  Medicaid agency costs associated with developing or 
maintaining a referral network between other systems and settings like those listed above with  mental 
health provi ders may be reimbursable  as administrative costs.  State Medicaid agencies should 
contact CMS for additional information.  
 
Page 4 –State Medicaid Director  
 
Improving data -sharing capabilities between schools, hospitals, primary care, criminal justice, and 
specialized mental health provide rs is an effective way to improve communications between these 
types of entities  and the healthcare system.  States may be able to access enhanced federal Medicaid 
matching funds for costs  to state Medicaid agencies  of implementing and operating technology  to 
improve data -sharing capabilities as part of the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture 
(MITA).
xxviixxvi  Many of the business processes described in MITA 3.0 regarding Care Management 
focus specifically on systems supporting the collection of information about an individual’s health 
status and needs.  States could use this authority and enhanced match to develop connections between 
mental health care providers and schools, hospitals, primary care, criminal justice, and  faith 
communities , consistent with the discussion of “Interoperability” contained in the final rule on this 
topic.   For example, enhanced federal financial participation (FFP) could be available to states for 
the development  by the state of  data -sharing capabilities between hospitals and c ommunity -based 
mental health providers such that when a beneficiar y with SMI or SED is being discharged from a 
hospital, that beneficiary’s  records regarding treatment could more easily be transferred to a 
community -based treatment provider  or, if the beneficiary was  being admitted to a hospital  for acute 
care, the community -based mental health provider could be notified more easily.   
 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has 
published comprehensive guidance for professionalsxxviii and health care consumersxxix explaining the 
circumstances in which health care providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) can share information related to mental health.  The HHS OCR 
guidance, requ ired by section 11003 of the 21st Century Cures Act, clarifies how the HIPAA Privacy 
Rule permits covered health care providers and other mental health treatment professionals to 
disclose information to a patient’s family members, caregivers, and others to facilitate treatment and 
protect the health and safety of patients with  SMI and SED  and others .  
 
Furthermore, i mproving the availability of behavioral health screenings and mental health and SUD 
services in schools is a key strategy for identifying and e ngaging children with SED in care sooner.  
Providing behavioral health services in school settings has been shown to improve access to care,
xxxiixxx 
increase early problem identification,xxxi and overcome reticence to access care by providing services 
in a more main stream and accessible setting.   States interested in making school- based mental 
health screening and behavioral health counseling more widely available could do so under the Early 
and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit.    
 
The EPSDT benefit provides a comprehensive array of prevention, diagnostic, and treatment services 
for Medicaid -enrolled children under age 21 as specified in section 1905(r) of the Act.  The EPSDT 
benefit requires states to have a schedule for screening servi ces both at established times and on an 
as-needed basis.  Covered screenings for children include medical, mental health, vision, hearing , and 
dental.  Incorporating an age appropriate, evidence -based screening tool designed to identify 
behavioral health c onditions into well -child examinations is an important step to identify mental 
health and SUD conditions early.  In addition, the EPSDT benefit requires that states provide all 
medically necessary services covered under the benefits in section 1905(a) of t he Act to correct or 
ameliorate physical and mental illnesses or conditions.  Behavioral health counseling could be 
covered under the rehabilitative services benefit at section 1905(a)(13) of the Act , but s tates would 
not need to amend their state plans to add EPSDT coverage for screening and behavioral health 
Page 5 –State Medicaid Director  
 
services .  However, some states choose to do so in order to clarify the services covered in the school 
setting.   
 
All providers of Medicaid services in schools must be qualified and enrolled as Medicaid providers.  
The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education jointly issued a 
toolkit outlining action steps and practices that states and local communities can take to improve 
availability of school -based health services and  supports that are critical for children with or at risk of 
SED.xxxiii
xxxiv  Other approach es to improving access to mental health services in schools include 
developing  partnerships with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and rural health 
clinics.   In addi tion, s tates could also ensure that their managed care plans allow for 
reimbursement of school -based providers.   
 
Integration of Mental Health Care and Primary Care  
 
Integration of mental health care into primary care settings can also help ensure that in dividuals with 
SMI or SED  are identified earlier and connected with appropriate treatment sooner.  In addition, 
integration is critical for improving access to treatment for comorbid physical health conditions and 
SUDs  that are common among  individuals wit h SMI or SED .  Some strategies for increasing  
integration of mental health care into primary care that are discussed below include  encouraging 
screening for mental health disorders and  supporting primary care providers  (PCPs)  and pediatricians 
to provide t reatment and/or referrals for mental health services with the support of consultations with 
specialists and care coordinators . 
 
Outpatient  provider visits offer critical opportunities to screen for mental health issues and suicidal 
ideation .  Research has found that 64 percent of individuals had visited a health care provider within 
a month prior to attempting suicide and 95 percent visited one within a year prior to attempting 
suicide.
xxxvixxxv  The Patient Health Questionnaire  (PHQ) -9 is a clinically validated as sessment tool 
focused on screening for depression and measuring depression severity which includes screen ing for 
the presence of suicidal ideation.  States  may wish to encourage providers  participating in their 
Medicaid programs  to screen for depression an d suicidal ideation using the PHQ -9 during outpatient 
office visits .  
 
One evidence- based approach to incorporating specialty mental health care into primary care settings, 
the Collaborative Care M odel, has been proven effective in over 80 randomized cont rolled trials.xxxvii  
Although originally designed to treat depression, there is increasing evidence of its effectiveness for 
treating other behavioral health conditions including anxiety, post -traumatic stress disorder, and 
SUDs.  This care model uses a team -based approach in which PCPs treat mental health and SUD 
issues of  their patients supported by a behavioral health care manager and a psychiatric 
consultant.  The behavioral health care manager is a social worker or psychologist who works with 
the PCP and i s trained to deliver care coordination and brief behavioral interventions.  The 
psychiatric consultant is a psychiatrist or physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse 
specialist with psychiatric training who makes treatment recommendations to the PCP, including 
medication and evidence -based therapy recommendations and medical management of any 
complications associated with treatment.   Key components of the Collaborative Care M odel include 
care coordination and care management by the care man ager, regular patient monitoring using 
Page 6 –State Medicaid Director  
 
clinical rating scales, the use of evidence- based approaches and stepped care that intensifies  and/or 
modifies  the approach for complex or treatment resistant cases , and regular psychiatric caseload 
reviews in person or through use of telemedicine with a psychiatric consultant.    
 
A less intensive model for children with mental health conditions is the Child Psychiatry Access 
Model supported by the National Network of Child Psychiatry Access Programs.xxxviii
xxxix  These 
programs generally offer telephonic consultation with a psychiatrist or other licensed behavioral 
health clinician , face- to-face psychiatric or behavioral health consultations for patients when needed, 
with a written summary provided to the PCP , and assistance with  referral to community -based 
behavioral health services.  For example, t he Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project Model, 
established in 2004, offers statewide access to over 95 percent of pediatric primary care providers in 
the state through six reg ional behavioral health consultation hubs.  Each hub includes a full -time 
child psychiatrist, licensed therapist, and a care coordinator.  Each hub operates a dedicated hotline 
and offers immediate clinical consultation over the telephone, expedited face -to-face psychiatric 
consultation, care coordination for assistance with referrals to community behavioral health services, 
and continuing professional education for primary care providers.  Participating pediatricians have 
reported a  significant improvement  in their ability to meet the mental health care needs of their 
patients  (although a considerable gap remains) : the percent of participating pediatricians who 
responded to an annual survey and said they could meet the needs of children with behavioral heal th 
problems increased from eight percent in 2008 to 64 percent in 2012.   
 
One issue that has been identified by a number of stakeholders as impeding broader implementation 
of these models is a lack of reimbursement for consultation and care coordination outside the 
presence of the patient .   Although the presence of the patient is required for the service to be 
covered, Medicaid may be able to reimburse for consultations between professionals regarding 
treatment for a patient and for care coordination if t hese costs are incorporated into the rate a state 
pays a provider for a covered service for a beneficiary.  Under such circumstances, the resources that 
go into that encounter (such as a consultation with a specialist regarding treatment options for that 
beneficiary) can be accounted for in the rate for that service.  The provider receiving the 
reimbursement would then have to reimburse the specialty provider.  Furthermore, Medicare covers  
payments to practitioners for behavioral health integration services , including the Collaborative Care 
Model, and has identified Current Procedural Technology (CPT) codes for these payments , which 
may be useful for states interested in supporting this model of care.xl  States are also encouraged to 
eliminate restrictions on  same- day billing for primary care and mental health services in order to 
facilitate implementation of these types of models.  
 
Use of telehealth technologies to support provision of the Collaborative Care model is another 
important strategy for facilitatin g broader availability of integrated mental health care and primary 
care. 
xliiixli   States may be able to access enhanced match  under MITA 3.0xlii for state development of 
telehealth -enabling technology to be used by Medicaid providers to coordinate care for benefi ciaries .  
Some examples include development of virtual treatment centers or remote counseling options 
integrated into care coordination technology consistent with the “Managing Care Information” 
business process under MITA 3.0 which includes activities con necting providers to patients and 
facilitating access to services.   For supporting state costs associated with implementing the 
Collaborative Care model or other team -based approaches, states could  also consider using the 
Page 7 –State Medicaid Director  
 
existing authority for Care Plan Exchange under MITA 3.0.xliv  The treatment services  themselves 
that are provided via tele -health technology could be covered using state plan or other Medicaid 
authorities.  
 
Similarly, the Health Home benefit under section 1945 of the Act could also be used to support this 
model of care.  The Health Home benefit offers 90 percent FFP for eight quarters for specific services 
including comprehensive care management, care coordination, comprehensive transition care, 
individual and family support, and the use of health information technology to link services.   
 
Improved Access to  Services Across the Continuum of Care Including Crisis Stabilization Services  
 
Adults  with SMI and children with SED need access to a continuum of care since these conditions are 
often e pisodic and the severity of symptoms can vary over time.
xlvii
xlviiixlv  However, the only treatment 
options in many regions are inpatient care for acute treatment needs and  outpatient care for less 
serious conditions and on- going maintenance therapy, with  little availa bility of intermediate levels of 
care. xlvi  As a result, individuals with serious mental health conditions often go into inpatient 
facilities or emergency departments when they could be better served in community -based settings.  
Furthermore, without the supports needed to help transition from acute care back into their 
communities, adults  with SMI are at heightened risk for relapse and readmission.   Mental health 
disorders are often the primary cause of hospital readmissions among adult Medicaid 
beneficiaries,  indicating a need for more evidence -based community -based supports and services.   
 
Strategies for ensuring individuals with SMI or SED  are provided appropriate levels of care to meet 
their needs include encouraging  use of evidence -based assessment too ls, e.g. the LOCUS and CASII 
(or CALOCUS), that link  clinical assessment s with standardized "levels of care" using methods for 
matching the two.xlix   It is also important that the care provided to individuals with SMI or SED is 
trauma -informed.l   
 
Another s trategy is to increas e availability of intensive outpatient and crisis stabilization programs 
designed to divert Medicaid beneficiaries from unnecessary stays in emergency departments (EDs) 
and inpatient facilities as well as  criminal justice involvement.li  Core elements of crisis stabilization 
programs  include  regional or statewide crisis call centers coordinating access to care in real time, 
centrally deployed mobile crisis units available 24 hours a day and seven days a week, and short -
term, sub- acute residential crisis stabilization programs.lii   
 
Depending on the circumstances, s ervices provided to beneficiaries in residential settings  may be 
subject to the payment exclusion for institutions for mental diseases (IMDs).liii  Section 1905(i) of the 
Act defines an IMD as any “hospital, nursing facility, or other institution of more than 16 beds, that is 
primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, 
including medical attention, nursing care, and related services.”liv  There is some authority for states 
to receive FFP for monthly capitation payments paid to Medicaid managed care plans for coverage of 
Medicaid beneficiaries residing in IMDs; Medicaid managed care rules  permit FFP  for monthly 
capitation payments to manag ed care plans for enrollees that are inpatients in a hospital providing 
psychiatric or SUD inpatient care or in a sub -acute psychiatric or S UD crisis residential setting that 
Page 8 –State Medicaid Director  
 
may qualify as IMDs when the stay is for no more  than 15 days during the period of the monthly 
capitation payment and certain other conditions are met.lv  
 
Furthermore, s tates may be able to access administrative match for crisis call centers as some states 
have  done  for tobacco quit lines.lvi  However, in order to access administrative match for crisis call 
centers , a state would have to justify in a reasonable manner how many callers are Medicaid 
beneficiaries in order to properly allocate costs to Medicaid.   States can refer to guidance on tobacco 
quit lines.lvii  Enhanced administrative match may be available under MITA 3.0 to help states 
establish crisis call centers to connect beneficiaries with mental health treatment as well as to develop 
technologies to link mobile crisis units to beneficiaries coping with serious mental health condi tions.  
 
States may also coordinate access to outreach, referral, and assessment services for behavioral health 
care through an established No Wrong Door System.lviii The No Wrong Door  System is a 
collaboration between CMS, t he U.S. Administrat ion for Communit y Living, and the Vete rans Health 
Administration to support states’ efforts to develop coordinated systems of access to make it easier 
for consumers to learn about and access Long -Term Service and Supports .  
 
The Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) demonstration lix offers a model for 
providing comprehensive community -based behavioral health care.  Certification criteria for 
CCBHCs under the demonstration include the availability of 24 -hour crisis care, utilization of 
evidence -based practices , care coordination, and integration of mental health, SUD, and physical 
health care.lx  To promote improved quality of care, CCBHCs are required to report on a range of 
quality measures.  States may be able to adapt the CCBHC model of care using different authorities, 
depending on the services provided, beneficiaries served, and payment methodologies.  For example, 
some CCBHC services may be authorized under the state plan and covered as clinic services with 
payment made using an encounter rate that pays fo r a bundle of behavioral health and primary care 
services .  States may also elect to  use incentive payment s (as is being done in the CCBHC 
demonstration) to encourage providers to implement the comprehensive model of care delineated for 
the CCBHC demonstra tion.lxi    
 
Another strategy for helping  adults with SMI or children with SED access  appropriate levels of care 
is development of the capability to track which mental health providers are accepting Medicaid 
beneficiaries at different levels of care througho ut the state, including outpatient, intensive outpatient, 
inpatient, and community -based crisis services.  Development by the state of this capability to track 
available mental health providers, such as through a type of registry reflecting qualified provi ders that 
is frequently updated, could be reimbursed under MITA 3.0 at 90% of the development costs and 
75% of the operational costs .lxii  Furthermore, Medicaid managed care plans ( managed care 
organizations , prepaid inpatient health plans, prepaid ambulatory  health plans , and, where applicable , 
primary care case management plans ) must identify as part of provider directories whether a network 
provider is accepting new patients under 42 C.F.R. § 438.10(h)(1)(vi) . 
 
Additional opportunities to engage Medicaid be neficiaries in community -based treatment include 
increasing availability of assertive community treatment (ACT) programs .lxiii  ACT programs  include 
a multidisciplinary team of mental health professionals with low client to staff ratios allowing for 
multiple c ontacts for clients needing intensive support and the capacity to respond 24 hours a day 
Page 9 –State Medicaid Director  
 
seven days a week.  ACT programs include frequent team meetings and offer integration of services 
instead of referring clients to other programs for other services.  C MS has previously issued a State 
Medicaid Director letter that included information about covering ACT programs in Medicaid.lxiv  
Coverable s ervices in  ACT programs  could include assessment, medication, medication management, 
therapy/counseling , and case mana gement.   
 
Many Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI or SED need skilled , person- centered planning , services , and 
supports  that address their cultural needs and values  and help them access services across a 
continuum of care as needed.  This type of planning identifies and addresses the person’s preferences 
and interests  and those paid and unpaid supports needed to achieve them .  The planning and services 
can be directed with the support of others whom the beneficiary selects. Those responsible for  
person- center ed practices should be engage d in a continuous learning and improvement process .   
 
HHS policy on person- centered thinking, planning, and practice is articulated in statute, regulations, 
guidance documents, prior grant and contract actions, and numerous HH S-sponsored presentations 
(see e.g., CMS ’ January  2014 HCBS final rulelxv and HHS Guidance for Implementing Standards for 
Person Centered Planning and Self -Direction issued in June 2014lxvi).  The se expectations apply to 
1915(c) waivers, and the 1915(i) and 1915(k) state plan options.  In addition, t he 2014 Guidance 
applies to all HHS programs serving people with disabilities and older adults  including several 
programs that serve people with SMI and SED, e.g., the Administration for Community Living  No 
Wrong Door program, the SAMHSA CCBHC program , and the SAMHSA Men tal Health Block 
Grant Program.  The Medicaid Health Home state plan option also requires person- centered planning 
and the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) eLTSS data elements  provide an electr onic 
mechanism to track key components of the person- centered service plan as part of a comprehensive 
health IT strategy .  Furthermore, psychiatric advance directives and individual participation in 
treatment and recovery services planning are important co mponents of person- centered planning for 
people with SMI and SED.   
 
There is a strong role for peers as natural allies in the facilitation of person -centered planning 
processes, and s elf-direction for mental health is an emerging practice that is being de veloped in 
several states and shows promising outcomes .lxvii
lxviii  Innovative models of community recovery support, 
such as “clubhouse” programs and wrap- around recovery support services provided by community 
health workers, emphasize the use of peer support specia lists and others to provide skills training, and 
assistance with educational and vocational needs.  CMS has previously issued a State Medicaid 
Director letter on covering peer support services in Medicaid,  as well as additional clarification 
that peer sup ports in some circumstances can include peer supports for the parents/legal guardians of 
Medicaid eligible children.lxix 
 
Better Care Coordination and Transitions to Community -based Care  
 
Improving coordination of care between levels of care and particularly  as individuals with SMI or 
SED leave inpatient or residential treatment is a critical issue that states should address in order to 
improve outcomes for beneficiaries with these conditions.  T he risk of suicide following discharge 
from psychiatric hospital s or wards  is greatest immediately following an inpatient stay , with the rate 
of suicide during the first three months after discharge approximately 100 times higher t han the 
Page 10 –State Medicaid Director  
 
global suicide rate according to a 2017 systematic review and meta- analysis .lxx  This study highlights 
how important  it is for individuals with SMI or SED to receive timely follow -up care  after leaving 
residential or inpatient treatment.   
 
Unfortunately, many  Medicaid beneficiaries do not receive timely  follow -up care within the 
timefra mes of 7 or 30 days that are used to measure timely follow -up care in the widely used measure 
“Follow -up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness” (NQF #0576).  Th is measure is included in both 
the core s et of health care quality measures for adults enroll ed in  Medicaid  (Adult Core Set) and the 
core set of children’s health care quality measures for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program (CHIP) (Child  Core Set) .  According to Medicaid data submitted by the thir ty-six states that 
reported the f ollow -up after hospitalization  measure in  fiscal year  (FY) 2016 (the latest data 
available) , a median of only 38 percent of adult beneficiaries  (ages 21 and older)  who were 
hospitalized for mental illness had a follow -up visit within 7 days of discharge and only 60 percent 
had a follow -up visit within 30 days of discharge.
lxxiilxxi  A median of 45 percent of children (ages 6 to 
20) who were hospitalized for mental illness had a follow -up visit within 7 days of discharge and 
only 68 percent had a follow -up visit within 30 days of di scharge for FY 2016 for the forty -one states 
who reported.    
 
One approach to improve care coordination following hospitalization is to implement accountability 
measures and payment incentives for plans and providers.  A model for this approach is the Medicare 
Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, which financially penalizes hospitals with relatively high 
rates of Medicare readmissions for specific conditions.lxxiii
lxxiv  Medicaid managed care plans can also be 
held accountable for performance on the widely used measures assessing follow -up after 
hospitalization (discussed above) and follow -up after emergency room care for mental illness (both of 
which are included in both the Adult  and Child Core Setslxxv).  States can add  these requirements 
to the ir contract s with  managed care plan s either through inclusion in a plan’s quality assessment and 
performance improvement (QAPI) program or through a plan or provider incentive arrangement.  
 
Ensuring that hospitals and residential treatment settings contac t discharged individuals with SMI or 
SED within a few days of leaving inpatient or residential care can help  improve  outcomes as can 
connecting those individuals with community -based care.  One recent study found that follow -up via 
mailed postcards , follow -up via telephone outreach, and suicide -focused cognitive behavioral therapy  
could each be highly effective, relative to usual care alone,  at reducing suicides  and attempted 
suicides for which there is a heightened risk following inpatient care .lxxvi
lxxvii  These in terventions were 
also expected to be relatively cost -effective as compared to the usual cost of care.   There is not a 
Medicaid benefit category that specifically authorizes coverage of  contacts by hospital/residential 
treatment program staff via mail or p hone calls following inpatient care or emergency room  visits; 
however, the cost of providing these kinds of follow -up contacts to Medicaid beneficiaries could be 
included in the rates that states set for inpatient and emergency room services.  Cognitive be havioral 
therapy can be covered using the rehabilitative services benefit.   
 
Peer support providers can help make connections between inpatient facilities and emergency 
departments and outpatient treatment providers.lxxviii   In addition, peer navigators, one -to-one support 
in group homes, and providing staff to accompany an adult with SMI when they attend medical and 
social services can also help prevent hospitalization of adults with SMI.  
Page 11 –State Medicaid Director  
 
 
The o ptional Health Home benefit can also support improve d care coordin ation following an 
inpatient stay.  As discussed above, Health H ome services include comprehensive transitional care 
from inpatient to other settings including appropriate follow -up care.  Currently, 18 out of 22 states 
with approved Health Home programs have identified beneficiaries with a mental health condition as 
a target population for the Health Home benefits  
 
Increased Access to Evidence- based Services that Address Social Risk Factors  
 
Supportive services designed to help individuals with SMI or SED  maintain a job or stay in school 
are often identified as crucial for  keeping these individuals  healthy and on the path to recovery.  
These types of services can offer key incentives for individuals with serious mental health conditions, 
particularly adole scents and young adults , to enter and remain engaged in treatment programs.lxxix
lxxxi  In 
addition, helping adults  with SMI maintain stable housing has been identified as a critical foundation 
for improving health outcomes.lxxx  However,  only 2 percent  of adults and t ransition -age youth with 
SMI received supported employment in 2016 (according to data from 43 states) and only three 
percent received supportive housing  in 2016 (according to data from 35 states) .   
 
Improving access to these supportive services , including supported education, which is a variation on 
supported employment, is a critical strategy for improving outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries with 
SMI or SED.  States can use existing Medicaid authorities, including 1915(c) Home and Community -
Based Waivers  and 1915(i) State Plan Amendments , to provide many of these supports.  Where 
Medicaid does not cover the supportive service itself, it generally covers services to connect 
beneficiaries to the necessary supports.   
 
States could also adopt, or expand elig ibility for, Medicaid “buy in” programs to allow working 
individuals with disabilities whose income and/or assets exceed limits for other eligibility pathways 
to “buy -in” to Medicaid coverage.lxxxii
lxxxiii  Medicaid “buy -in” programs could help eligible individuals 
with SMI or SED obtain and maintain employment by helping them avoid having to choose between 
healthcare coverage and work .    
 
A summary of the key components of the models of care and activities highlighted above along with 
Medicaid authorities that state s may be able to use to implement these strategies  and additional 
information  on the specific Medicaid authorities are provided in Appendix A.  However, which 
services are coverable by Medicaid would depend on the Medicaid authority the states seek to use, 
and s tates should work with CMS on specific proposals to ensure they are feasible within Medicaid 
authority.   
 
II. SMI/SED Demonstration Opportunity  
 
As required by section 12003 of the Cures Act, CMS is announcing opportunities for demonstration 
project s under section 1115(a) of the Act to improve care for adults with SMI and children with SED 
(referred to as this “SMI/SED demonstration opportunity”).  Under section 1115(a) of the Act, the 
Secretary of HHS (“Secretary”) or CMS, operating under the Secret ary’s delegated authority, may 
authorize a state to conduct experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects that, in the judgment of the 
Page 12 –State Medicaid Director  
 
Secretary, are likely to assist in promoting the objectives of title XIX of the Act.   This SMI/SED 
demonstration opportunity will allow states, upon CMS approval of their demonstrations, to receive 
FFP for services furnished to Medicaid beneficiaries during short term stays for acute care in 
psychiatric hospitals or residential treatment settings that qualify as IMDs if tho se states are also 
taking action, through these demonstrations, to ensure  good quality of care in IMDs and to improve 
access to community -based services  as described below .  This SMI/SED demonstration opportunity 
is comparable to the recent section 1115(a)  demonstration opportunity to improve treatment for 
SUDs, including opioid use disorder (OUD) . lxxxiv  However, through these demonstrations , states will 
focus on demonstrating  improved care for individuals with serious mental health conditions in 
inpatient or residential settings that qualify as IMDs as well as through improvements to community -
based mental health care.  
 
The payment exclusion for services provided to most Medicaid beneficiaries while residing in IMDs 
is often cited as a significant impediment to ensuring adequate access to acute care for beneficiaries 
with SMI or SED .  Some stakeholders assert that as a result of this payment exclusion, Medicaid 
beneficiaries with these conditions often present in emergency rooms where they are unlikely to 
recei ve adequate care and  where they often must wait for hours and even days before space in an 
inpatient psychiatric facility becomes available.  Alternatively, beneficiaries  may be admitted to a 
general hospital, but usually only for a very short period of ti me before being discharged, sometimes 
before being stabilized, and often without being connected to outpatient care.  In addition, some 
stakeholders assert that the lack of intensive community -based services and discharge planning 
linking people with community -based supports results in individuals not transitioning out of acute 
care facilities in a timely fashion , which further limits inpatient capacity to address the acute care 
needs of individuals with SMI  or SED .  CMS is proposing to test these assertions. Furthermore, CMS 
believes that increasing access to mental health care, including acute treatment  as well as community -
based services , could help address increasing suicide rateslxxxv
lxxxvi since mental health disorders are often 
implicated in suicidal behavior .   
 
Through this demonstration opportunity, FFP would be available for services for beneficiaries who 
are short -term residents in IMDs primarily to receive mental health treatment.  While residing in 
those facilities primarily to receive mental health treat ment, Medicaid beneficiaries should also be 
screened for co -occurring SUDs as well as physical health conditions.  States with approved 
demonstrations could also receive FFP for Medicaid coverable services provided to otherwise eligible 
beneficiaries to tr eat any co -occurring SUD and physical health conditions while those beneficiaries 
are residing short term in IMD s primarily to receive mental health treatment.   
 
States may participate in the SUD demonstration opportunity and this SMI/SED demonstration 
opportunity at the same time.  In the event that a state already has an approved SUD demonstration —
or is seeking concurrent approval of an SUD and SMI/SED demonstration —CMS will provide 
technical assistance regarding how the two demonstration types may be op erationalized.   Consistent 
with the SUD demonstration opportunity, s tates will be expected to achieve a statewide average 
length of stay of 30 days  for beneficiaries receiving care in IMDs pursuant to this SMI/SED 
demonstration opportunity.   
 
Page 13 –State Medicaid Director  
 
Through this SMI/SED demonstration opportunity , states may receive federal matching funds for 
Medicaid -coverable services provided to individuals residing in psychiatric hospitals and residential 
treatment settings  that are not ordinarily matchable because these facili ties qualify as IMDs; however, 
this SMI/SED  demonstration opportunity does not allow for room and board payments in residential 
treatment  settings  unless they qualify as inpatient facilities  under section 1905(a) of the Act.  This 
limitation on covering ro om and board is a long -standing Medicaid policy  based on statute and 
regulations .lxxxvii
lxxxviii
lxxxix  Furthermore, FFP will not be available through these demonstrations for services 
provided in nursing homes  that qualify as IMDs  as CMS understands that nursing homes do not  
specialize in providing mental health treatment and may not have staff with appropriate credentials 
and training to provide good quality treatment  to individuals with SMI or SED.  FFP also will not be 
available through these SMI/SED demonstrations for ser vices provided in treatment settings for 
individuals 21 years of age or younger if those settings do not meet CMS requirements to qualify for 
the Inpatient  Psychiatric Services for Individuals under Age 21 benefit.   In addition, FFP will 
not be available through these demonstrations  for services in a psychiatric hospital or residential 
treatment facility for inmates who are involuntarily residing in the facility by operation of criminal 
law.   States should contact CMS with any questions regarding these li mitations.   
 
CMS will not approve a demonstration project under section 1115(a) of the Act unless the project is  
expected to be budget neutral to the federal government.xc  A budget neutral  demonstration project 
does not result in Medicaid costs to the federal government that are greater than  what the federal 
government’s Medicaid costs would likely have been absent the demonstration.  What the federal 
government’s Medicaid costs would likely have been absent the demonstration may include coverage 
of populat ions or services that the state could have otherwise provided through its Medicaid state plan 
or other title XIX authority, such as a waiver under section 1915 of the Act.  CMS considers these 
expenditures to be “hypothetical;” that is, the expenditures would have been eligible to receive FFP 
elsewhere in the Medicaid program .  For these hypothetical expenditures, CMS currently adjusts the 
budget neutrality test to effectively treat these expenditures as if they were approved Medicaid state 
plan services.  Hypothetical expenditures, therefore, do not necessitate savings to offset the otherwise 
allowable costs.  Nonetheless, with the approval of an SMI/SED  demonstration, states will agree  to 
report  all title XIX expenditures , except spending under certain managed care arrangements,  during 
SMI/SED -related IMD stays consistent with the Special Terms and Conditions ( STCs ) for the 
demonstration. 
 
States participating in the SMI/SED demonstration opportunity will also be expected to commit to 
taking a number of act ions to improve community -based mental health care, as section 12003 of the 
Cures Act also directed CMS to address systems for providing community -based services for 
beneficiaries with SMI or SED.  These commitments to improving community -based care are to  be 
linked to a set of goals for the SMI/SED demonstration opportunity described  below and should 
include actions to ensure good quality of care in IMDs, to improve connections to community -based 
care following stays in acute care settings, to ensure a con tinuum of care is available to address more 
chronic, on- going mental health care needs of beneficiaries with SMI or SED, to provide a full array 
of crisis stabilization services, and to engage beneficiaries with SMI or SED in treatment as soon as 
possible .  These state actions should build on the opportunities for innovative service delivery 
reforms discussed in Part I of this letter  to achieve  the goals and milestones described below .   
Page 14 –State Medicaid Director  
 
CMS will consider a state’s commitment to on -going maintenance of effo rt on funding outpatient 
community -based mental health services  as demonstrated in their application  when determining 
whether to approve a state’s proposed demonstration project  in order to ensure that resources are not 
disproportionately  drawn into increasing access to treatment in inpatient and residential settings  at the 
expense of community -based services.  Furthermore, CMS strongly encourages states to include in 
their application a thorough assessment of current availability of mental health services throughout 
the state, particularly crisis stabilization services.xci 
 
Similar to  the SUD demonstration opportunity , this SMI/SED demonstration opportunity  offers states 
the flexibility to design section 1115(a) demonstrations aimed at making significant impr ovements on 
a number of goals and milestones  that are described below .   
 
Goals:  
 
• Reduced utilization and lengths of stay in EDs among Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI or 
SED while awaiting mental health treatment in specialized settings;  
 
• Reduced preventab le readmissions to acute care hospitals  and residential settings ;  
 
• Improved availability of crisis stabilization services including services made available 
through call centers and mobile crisis units, intensive outpatient services, as well as services 
provided during acute short -term stays in residential crisis stabilization programs, psychiatric 
hospitals , and residential treatment setting s throughout the state;  
 
• Improved access to community -based services to address the chronic mental health care needs 
of beneficiaries with SMI or SED including through increased integration of primary and 
behavioral health care; and  
 
• Improved care coordination, especially continuity of care in the community following 
episodes of acute care in hospitals and residential tr eatment facilities.  
 
Milestones : 
 
Ensuring Quality of Care in Psychiatric Hospitals and Residential Settings  
 
• Participating hospitals and residential settings are licensed or otherwise authorized by the 
state to primarily provide treatment for mental illn esses and are accredited by a nationally 
recognized accreditation entity including the Joint Commission or the Commission on 
Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) prior to receiving FFP for services provided 
to beneficiaries;  
 
• Establishment of an o versight and auditing process  that include s unannounced visits for 
ensuring participating psychiatric hospitals and residential treatment settings  meet state 
licensure or certification  requirements as well as a national accrediting entity’s accreditation 
requirements;  
Page 15 –State Medicaid Director  
 
 
• Use of a utilization review entity  (e.g., a managed care organization  or administrative service 
organization) to ensure beneficiaries have access to the appropriate levels and types of care 
and to provide oversight to ensure lengths of st ay are limited to what is medically necessary 
and only those who have a clinical need to receive treatment in psychiatric hospitals and 
residential treatment settings are receiving treatment in those facilities ; 
 
• Participating psychiatric hospitals and res idential treatment settings meet federal program 
integrity requirements, and  the state has  a process for conducting risk- based screening of all 
newly enrolling providers, as well as revalidating existing providers  (specifically, under 
existing regulations , states must screen all newly enrolling providers and reevaluate existing 
providers pursuant to the rules in 42 CFR Part 455 Subparts B and E, ensure treatment 
providers have entered into Medicaid provider agreements pursuant to 42 CFR 431.107, and 
establ ish rigorous program integrity protocols to safeguard against fraudulent billing and other 
compliance issues ); 
 
• Implementation of a state requirement that  participating  psychiatric hospitals and residential 
treatment settings screen enrollees for co -morbid physical health conditions  and SUDs  and 
demonstrate the capacity to address co -morbid physical health conditions during short -term 
stays in these treatment settings (e.g., with on -site staff, telemedicine, and/or partnerships with 
local physical health pr oviders);  
 
Improving Care Coordination and Transitions to Community -Based Care  
 
• Implementation of a process to ensure that psychiatric hospitals and residential treatment 
settings provide intensive pre -discharge, care coordination services to help transiti on 
beneficiaries out of these settings and into appropriate community -based outpatient services -  
as well as requirements that community -based providers participate in these transition efforts 
(e.g., by allowing  initial services with a community -based provider while a beneficiary is still 
residing in these settings  and/or by hiring peer support specialists to help beneficiaries make 
connections with available community -based providers , including, where applicable, plans for 
employment);  
 
• Implementation of a  process to assess the housing situation of  individuals transitioning to the 
community from psychiatric hospitals and residential treatment settings  and connect  those 
who are homeless or have unsuitable or unstable housing  with community providers that 
coordinate housing services  where available;   
 
• Implementation of a requirement that psychiatric hospitals and residential treatment settings 
have protocols in place to ensure contact is made by the treatment setting with each 
discharged beneficiary within 72 hours of discharge and to ensure follow -up care is accessed 
by individuals after leaving those facilities by contacting the individuals directly and by 
contacting the community -based provider the  person was  referred to;  
 
Page 16 –State Medicaid Director  
 
• Implementation of strategies to pre vent or decrease the lengths of stay in EDs among 
beneficiaries  with SMI or SED (e.g., through the use of peersxcii and psychiatric consultants in 
EDs to help with discharge and referral to treatment providers);  
 
• Implementation of strategies to develop and en hance interoperability  and data sharing 
between physical, SUD, and mental health providers with the goal of enhancing care 
coordination so that disparate providers may better share clinical information to improve 
health outcomes for beneficiaries with SMI or SED ; 
 
Increasing Access to Continuum of Care Including Crisis Stabilization Services  
 
• Annual assessments of the availability of mental health services throughout the state, 
particularly crisis stabilization services and updates on steps taken to increas e availability;  
 
• Commitment to a financing plan approved by CMS to be implemented by the end of the 
demonstration to increase availability of non- hospital, non- residential crisis stabilization 
services, including services made available through crisis call  centers, mobile crisis units,  
coordinated community crisis response that involves law enforcement and other first 
responders, and observation/assessment  centers as well as on -going community -based 
services, e.g.,  intensive outpatient services, assertive community treatment, xciii and services in 
integrated care settings such as the C ertified C ommunity Behavioral H ealth C linic model 
described in Part I of this letter  as well as consideration of a self -direction option for 
beneficiaries ; 
 
• Implementation of strategies to improve the state’s capacity to track the availability of 
inpatient and crisis stabilization beds to help connect individuals in need with that level of 
care as soon as possible;  
 
• Implementation of a requirement that providers, plans, and utiliza tion review entities use an 
evidence -based, publicly available  patient assessment tool, preferably endorsed by a mental 
health provider association, e.g., LOCUS or CASII,xciv to help determine appropriate level of 
care and length of stay;  
 
Earlier Identificat ion and Engagement in Treatment Including Through Increased Integration 
 
• Implementation of strategies for identifying and engaging individuals, particularly adolescents 
and young adults , with serious mental health conditions, in treatment sooner  including 
through supported employment and supported education programs ; xcv 
 
• Increasing integration of behavioral health care in non- specialty care settings, including 
schools and primary care practices, to improve identification of serious mental health 
conditions s ooner and improve awareness of and linkages to specialty treatment providers; 
and 
 
Page 17 –State Medicaid Director  
 
• Establishment of specialized settings and services, including crisis stabilization services, 
focused on the needs of young people experiencing SMI or SED.xcvi 
 
Demonstration Ap plication    
 
States wishing to participate in this initiative can submit a demonstration application to CMS 
outlining the state’s strategy for achieving the goals of this demonstration opportunity, including a 
commitment to meeting the milestones  described above  that are critical steps for achieving these 
goals over the course of the demonstration.  CMS strongly encourages states to articulate in their 
demonstration applications  how their proposal s will apply evidence- based programs to meet the 
needs of pe ople with SMI or SED  in their state s.  States’ applications should also describe the state’s 
capacity for regular reporting on progress toward meeting these milestones as well as for collecting 
and reporting data on performance measures.  In addition, stat es’ applications should confirm their 
commitment to assuring the necessary resources will be available to effectively support 
implementation of a robust monitoring protocol and evaluation.  
 
Implementation Plan  
 
Participating states will also develop implementation plans describing the various timelines and 
activities the states will undertake to achieve the milestones listed above.  States will have the option 
of submitting their implementation plans as part of their applications or as post approval protocols.  
Authorization of FFP for services in inpatient hospitals or residential treatment settings that qualify as 
IMDs will be contingent upon assurance by the state that all participating IMDs are licensed and 
accredited , community -based alternatives are or  will be available throughout the state under the 
state’s financing plan described above,  and CMS has approved the SMI/SED demonstration’s 
implementation plan .  The expectation is that states will meet the milestones by the end of the first 
two years of th e demonstration.  However, r egardless of whether the implementation plan is 
submitted as part of a state’s application or as a post -approval protocol , FFP for services provided 
during Medicaid beneficiary stays in IMDs will be prospective only and continge nt upon CMS 
approval of the state’s implementation plan. 
 
As a state’s SMI/SED demonstration progresses, the state will be expected to include, in its section 
1115(a) demonstration monitoring reports, information detailing the state’s progress toward meeti ng 
the milestones and timeframes specified in the state’s implementation plan , as well as information 
and data so that CMS can monitor budget neutrality.  
 
States seeking approval of an SMI/SED demonstration also will be expected to submit a Health IT 
Plan (“HIT Plan”) that describe s the state’s  ability to leverage health IT, advance health information 
exchange(s) , and e nsure health IT interoperability in support of the demonstration’s goals.  The HIT 
Plan should address electronic care plan sharing, care coordination, and behavioral health -physical 
health integration.  CMS will provide additional guidance on these expectations . 
 
Monitoring Protocol for Performance Measures Aligned with Initiative Goals  
 
Page 18 –State Medicaid Director  
 
As outlined above, states will include in their sectio n 1115(a) demonstration reports, information 
detailing milestones and performance measures representing key indicators of progress toward 
meeting the goals for this initiative .  Participating states will report on a common set of measures and 
the state s and CMS will agree to  additional measures and measure concepts specific to a particular 
state’s demonstration parameters.  A list of potential measures is included in Appendix B.  Reporting 
templates are subject to OMB review and approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.   
 
CMS will provide guidance to participating states on development of  monitoring protocols that will 
identify expectations for quarterly and annual monitoring reports, including  agreed upon performance 
measures , measure concepts, and quali tative narrative summaries.  For performance measures, CMS’ 
guidance will include recommendations for baselines and targets.  Both quantitative and qualitative 
information will align with the milestones outlined above.  Any deviations from CMS’ guidance the 
state wishes to make will be documented in the monitoring protocol.  Th e monitoring protocol will be 
developed after CMS approval of the demonstration in consultation with CMS, and a timeframe for 
finalizing the monitoring protocol will be included in the STCs  of each demonstration.   
 
The data reported by the state will inform a mid -point assessment between years two and three of the 
demonstration during which CMS will identify whether states are making sufficient progress toward 
meeting the milestones a nd performance measure targets.  The mid -point assessment will also include 
an assessment of whether a state is  on track to meet the budget neutrality requirements.  States at risk 
of not meeting these targets will submit modifications to their implementation plans, which will be 
subject to CMS approval.  CMS may require a s tate to provide a corrective action plan if it fails to 
meet the required annual triggers indicating that waiver spending is diver ging from the expected 
trajectory under the budget neutr ality requirements.  Furthermore , FFP for services to individuals 
residing in IMDs may be withheld if states are not making adequate progress on meeting the 
milestones and goals as evidenced by reporting on the milestones and the required performance 
measu res in the monitoring protocol agreed upon by the state and CMS.  Additionally , achievement 
of the milestones and performance measure targets will be taken into consideration by CMS if a state 
were to request an extension of its demonstration. 
 
States will also be required to conduct independent and robust interim and final evaluations that will 
draw on the data collected for the milestones and performance measures, as well as other data and 
information needed to support the evaluation that will describe the effectiveness and impact of the 
demonstration using quantitative and qualitative outcomes and a cost analysis.  An evaluation design 
will be developed by the state, with technical assistance from CMS, to be finalized within 180 days of 
the demonstration approval.  The evaluation design will include detailed analytic plans, data 
development, collection, and reporting details and will be subject to CMS approval. States that fail to 
submit an acceptable and timely evaluation design as well as any required mo nitoring, expenditure or 
other evaluation reporting, are subject to a $5 million deferral per deliverable.  The interim evaluation 
will be required one year before expiration of the demonstration or when the state submits a proposal 
to renew the demonstrat ion.  The final evaluations will be due eighteen months after the 
demonstration period ends. 
 
Public Availability of Data on State Progress toward Meeting Milestones and Performance 
Measure Targets as well as Evaluation Reports  
Page 19 –State Medicaid Director  
 
 
CMS will regularly post in formation on the Medicaid.gov website regarding the states’ progress in 
meeting the agreed upon milestones and performance measure targets.  In addition, states’ regular 
1115 reports, as well as their evaluation reports, will be posted, as required by sect ion 1115 
transparency rules.  
 
Submission Process for Section 1115(a) Demonstration  
 
States should follow the usual process for submitting section 1115(a) demonstration proposals as 
outlined in the federal section 1115(a) demonstration project transparency regulations at 42 CFR 
431.412 and 42 CFR 431.408.  As explained in these regulations, states should submit an application 
that includes the following information:  
 
• A comprehensive description of the demonstration, including the state’s strategies for 
addressing the goals and milestones discussed above for this demonstration initiative;  
 
• A comprehensive plan to address the needs of beneficiaries with SMI or SED, including an 
assessment of how this demonstration will complement and not supplant state act ivities called 
for or supported by other federal authorities and funding streams;  
 
• A description of the proposed health care delivery system, eligibility requirements, benefit 
coverage and cost sharing (premiums, copayments, and deductibles) required of  individuals 
who will be impacted by the demonstration, to the extent such provisions would vary from the 
State’s current program features and the requirements of the Social Security Act;  
 
• A list of the waivers and expenditure authorities that the state  believes to be necessary to 
authorize the demonstration;  
 
• An estimate of annual aggregate expenditures by population group impacted by the 
demonstration, including development of baseline cost data for these populations. 
Specifically, CMS requests that  states ’ fiscal analysis demonstrate how the proposed changes 
will be budget neutral, i.e., will not increase federal Medicaid spending. CMS will work 
closely with states to determine the feasibility of their budget neutrality models and suggest 
changes as  necessary;  
 
• Enrollment data including historical mental health care coverage and projected coverage 
over the life of the demonstration, of each category of beneficiary whose health care coverage 
is impacted by the demonstration;  
 
• Written documentati on of the state’s compliance with the public notice requirements at 42 
CFR 431.408, with a report of the issues raised by the public during the comment period and 
how the state considered those comments when developing the final demonstration 
application s ubmitted to CMS;  
 
Page 20 –State Medicaid Director  
 
• The research hypotheses that are related to the demonstration’s proposed changes, goals, and 
objectives, and a general plan for testing the hypotheses including, if feasible, the 
identification of appropriate evaluation indicators ; and  
 
• An i mplementation Plan (if being submitted at the time of application).  
 
CMS requests that these Section 1115(a) demonstration proposals describe, in as much detail as 
possible , the state’s strategy for improving access to and quality of mental health care through the 
proposed demonstration and how the state’s proposed demonstration will further the goals of the 
initiative described above.  The application should include a description of the activities the state 
plans to undertake to address the miles tones listed  above and to report on progress toward meeting 
the milestone and performance measures.  If it is not feasible to include in the application a detailed 
implementation plan specifying how and when the state proposes to meet the milestones, the s tate 
should propose a date by which an implementation plan will be submitted by the state (generally 
within at least 90 days of approval of the application), and this dat e will be included in the STCs.  As 
a reminder, FFP for services in IMDs will not be a vailable through the demonstration until the 
implementation plan/protocol is approved by CMS, at which time FFP will b e available only 
prospectively.  In addition, the state should indicate what data sources and resources it proposes to 
use for reporting on performance measures. CMS will work with states to develop a detailed 
monitoring protocol for these data points and performance measures after the application is received 
from the state.  
 
After states develop 1115 demonstration proposals that include the information listed above, states 
must follow the minimum 30 -day public notice and comment procedures outlined in 42 CFR 
431.408, to allow opportunity for public input on the application prior to submission to CMS. These 
procedures include  consultation wi th Indian tribes and Indian health providers (to the extent there are 
Indian tribes and Indian health providers located within geographic boundaries of the state) to solicit 
advice from the Indian health providers on ensuring access for American Indian and Alaska Native 
(AI/AN) individuals to the services that are part of the demonstration and that these services meet the 
unique and cultural needs of AI/AN individuals.  
 
CMS is available to provide technical assistance to states on how to meet federal trans parency 
requirements as well as to preview states ’ draft 1115(a)  proposals and public notice documentation to 
help ensure states successfully meet federal requirements.

Additional Information on Medicaid Authorities  
 
Many of the services that are essential to the implementat ion of services for adults with a SMI and 
children with a SED may be covered based on section 1905(a) of the Act.  A number of Medicaid 
service categories that are particularly relevant to covering the innovative service delivery strategies 
and community -based services for adults with a SMI or children with a SED described above are 
discussed below.   
 
Section 1905(a) – State Plan Benefits : 
 
Section 1905(a)(13) -  Rehabilitative Services  
 
Rehabilitative services, as set forth in 42 C .F.R § 440.130(d), are “a ny medical or remedial services 
recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts, within the scope of his 
practice under state law, for maximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of a 
beneficiary to his best possible functional level.”  Services such as individual and group therapy, 
crisis stabilization, peer support, behavioral interventions, and care coordination of other behavioral 
health services may be authorized under this benefit.   
 
Page 26 –State Medicaid Director  
 
Section 1905(a )(6) -  Other Licensed Practitioner Services  
 
Other licensed practitioner services, as set forth in 42 C .F.R § 440.60(a), are “medical or remedial 
care or services, other than physicians’ services, provided by licensed practitioners within the scope 
of pra ctice as defined under State law.”  For example, this benefit could be used to cover counseling 
services of a licensed clinical social worker.    
 
Section 1905(a)(19) -  Case Management Services  
 
Case management services include services that assist eligib le individuals to gain access to needed 
medical, social, educational, and other services.  42 C .F.R § 440.169(a) .  Case management services 
include all of the following components: comprehensive assessment and periodic assessment of an 
eligible individual’ s needs; development and periodic revision of a specific care plan; referrals to 
services and related activities to help the eligible individual obtain needed services; and monitoring 
and follow -up activities.  42 C .F.R. § 440.169(d) .  States may target ca se management services to a 
specific group of beneficiaries, such as adults  with SMI or children with SED, or to individuals who 
reside in specified areas of the state (or both).  42 C .F.R § 440.169(b).   
 
Section 1905(a)(9) -  Clinic Services   
 
Clinic serv ices refer to “preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services that 
are furnished by a facility that is not part of a hospital but is organized and operated to provide 
medical care to outpatients.” 42 C .F.R § 440.90.  Clinic ser vices include  “services furnished at the 
clinic by or under the direction of a physician or dentist” and “services furnished outside the clinic, 
by clinic personnel under the direction of a physician, to an eligible individual who does not reside in 
a per manent dwelling or does not have a fixed home or mailing address.”  42 C.F.R. § 440.90(a) -(b). 
 
Section 1905(a)(5) -  Physicians’ Services  
 
Physicians’ s ervices refer to services “whether furnished in the office, the beneficiary’s home, a 
hospital, a skill ed nursing facility, or elsewhere, means services furnished by a physician (1) within 
the scope of practice of medicine or osteopathy as defined by State law; and (2) by or under the 
personal supervision of an individual licensed under State law to practic e medicine or ost eopathy.” 42 
C.F.R. § 440.50(a) .  
 
Section 1905(r) -  Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment  (EPSDT)  Benefit  
 
Under the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit set forth in 
section 1905(r) of  the Act, states must make available any service listed in section 1905(a) of the Act 
that is needed to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental conditions discovered by 
EPSDT screening services, whether or not the service is covered under the state plan.   
 
Section 1905(a)(1) and (2) -  Hospital Services  
 
Page 27 –State Medicaid Director  
 
Hospital Services,  defined at 1905(a)(1) and 1905(a)(2) and implemented at 42 C .F.R. § 440.10 and 
42 C .F.R. § 440.20, includes  both inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services.  For i npatient 
hospital services, the term means services (1) that are ordinarily furnished in a hospital for the care 
and treatment of inpatients, (2) are furnished under the direction of a physician or dentist; and (3) are 
furnished in an institution that is m aintained primarily for the care and treatment of patients with 
disorders other than mental diseases and is licensed or approved as a hospital by an officially 
designated authority for state standard setting.  There must be in effect a utilization review p lan, 
applicable to all Medicaid patients that meets the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 482.30, absent a waiver 
from  the S ecretary. For outpatient hospital services, the term means preventive, diagnostic, 
therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services tha t (1) are furnished to outpatients and (2) are 
furnished by or under the direction of a physician or dentist.  The criteria listed for inpatient hospital 
services regarding standard setting mean that meeting the requirements for Medicare participation 
also apply. Outpatient hospital services may be limited by a Medicaid agency by excluding from the 
definition those items and services that are not generally furnished by most hospitals in the state. 
 
Section 1905(a)(16) -  Inpatient Psychiatric Services for In dividuals under Age 21  
 
Under section 1905(a) of the Act, there is a general prohibition on Medicaid payment for any services 
provided to any individual who is under age 65 and who is residing in an Institution for Mental 
Diseases (IMD) unless the payment  is for inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under 
age 21 pursuant to section 1905(a)(16) of the Act, as defined in section 1905(h) of the Act.  
Implementing regulations at 42 C .F.R. § 440.160 and 441 Subpart D define these inpatient 
psychiatric hospital services as services furnished by a psychiatric hospital, a general hospital with a 
psychiatric program that meets the applicable conditions of participation, or an accredited psychiatric 
facility that meets certain requirements.  Section  12005 of the 21st Century Cures Act amends section 
1905(a)(16)  of the Act  to require  Medicaid reimbursement for EPSDT services to individuals under 
age 21 receiving inpatient psychiatric services  pursuant to section  1905(a)(16)  of the Act .  The 
effective date of this amendment is January 1, 2019.   
 
Section 1905(a)(14) -  Inpatient Hospital Services and Nursing Facility Services for Individuals Age 
65 or Older in Institutions for Mental Diseases  
 
Services to individuals age 65 or older in these types of fac ilities may be reimbursed when the 
individuals meet the requirements for admission to these facilities and the facilities meet applicable 
federal requirements as set forth in 42 C .F.R § 440.140. 
 
School -based Services  
 
While there is no state plan benefit entitled “school -based services,” CMS allows reimbursement of 
Medicaid -covered services to Medicaid -eligible children when delivered by Medicaid providers, 
including in a school setting.  Many states have already developed reimbursement mechanisms where 
Medicaid pays for medical services, including mental health treatment services in school 
settings.   States can consider developing school -based health centers to enhance their capacity to 
deliver mental health services, require managed care plans responsible  for delivering mental health 
Page 28 –State Medicaid Director  
 
services to contract with school providers, or develop other arrangements between health facilities 
and schools.   
 
Sections 1903(m) and 1932 – Managed Care  
 
Consistent with sections 1903(m) and 1932 of the Act, states may del iver Medicaid -covered services 
through managed care plans  by way of an amendment to the Medicaid state plan . States must 
continue to assure adequate access to and the availability of the full set of covered state plan services, 
including EPSDT and generall y must provide beneficiaries with a choice of at least two managed 
care plans.  Managed care contracts are subject to CMS review and approval; managed care 
capitation rates must be projected to provide for all reasonable, appropriate, and attainable costs that 
are required under the terms of the contract and for the operation of the managed care plan for the 
time period and the population covered under the terms of the contract and be reviewed and approved 
by CMS as actuarially sound.  
 
Section 1915(b) Auth ority – Freedom of Choice 
 
Under section 1915(b) of the Act (1915(b) waiver), CMS may grant a waiver to permit states to 
restrict beneficiary free choice of provider, to create defined provider networks, which could be part 
of a managed care service delivery system. When using this authority, states may use the savings 
accrued through the use of a managed care delivery system to provide additional services.  Unless an 
expenditure authority is provided as part of a section 1115 demonstration, managed care se rvice 
delivery systems that rely on contracts with managed care plans must also comply with section 
1903(m ).  Under section 1915(a) of the Social Security Act, states can implement a voluntary 
managed care program by executing a contract with organizations  that the state has procured using a 
competitive procurement process.  
 
Section 1915(c) -  Home and Community -based Services Waiver Authority  
 
States may request a waiver to provide beneficiaries who would otherwise need to receive care in an 
institution, ce rtain long -term care services and supports in community settings.  States can use this 
authority to develop comprehensive benefit designs that include additional supportive services.  
States may not restrict freedom of choice under this waiver but may requ est waivers of comparability 
and state- wideness, enabling them to limit the services to subgroups of Medicaid beneficiaries and to 
an area within the state. States  may also limit participation to a specific number of beneficiaries.  
 
 
Section 1915(i) – Hom e and Community -based Services State Plan Amendment  
 
Section 1915(i) provides an opportunity for states to amend their state Medicaid plans to offer home 
and community -based services (HCBS) including case management, respite, and other HCBS for 
elderly an d disabled individuals who meet needs -based eligibility criteria set by the state. Section 
1915(i) State plan HCBS is a benefit that is very similar to Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers except 
that unlike 1915(c), authority under 1915(i) delinks the provision of HCBS from the requirement that 
participants must meet an institutional level of care.  In order to target the initiative and limit costs, 
Page 29 –State Medicaid Director  
 
states may identify a specific population and can also establish additional needs -based criteria by 
service.  States  may target the 1915(i) benefit to particular population groups such as adults or 
adolescents  with mental health disorders, but cannot waive the requirement to provide the HCBS 
statewide, nor limit the number of participants in the state who may receive th e HCBS if they meet 
the population definition.   
 
Section 1945 -  Health Home Optional Benefit  
 
Section 1945 of the Act provides an optional Medicaid state plan benefit available to states to design 
Health Homes to coordinate care for individuals with Medi caid who have chronic conditions, 
including a mental health condition or SUD.  Health Homes must provide comprehensive care 
management, care coordination, health promotion, comprehensive transitional care/follow -up, 
beneficiary and family/caregiver support , and referral to community and social support services.
