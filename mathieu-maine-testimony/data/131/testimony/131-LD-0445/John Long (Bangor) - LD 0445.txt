LD 445
"I want to support LD 445. Our hospitals are in a crisis now, their emergency rooms 
filled with poor souls suffering from various uncompensated mental illnesses. These 
hospitals are losing significant resources and are having increasing financial deficits. 
This outdated policy delays the care of patients requiring other systemic medical 
services. There is simply no logical reason for continuing the Federal government 
policy of limiting Medicaid payments to hospitals with more than 16 beds providing 
mental health services. These hospitals are the primary resource for acute mental 
health issues. These poor patients need proper care,  and the hospitals must be 
adequately reimbursed."
