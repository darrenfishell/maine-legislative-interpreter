Re:  LD 599 – An Act to Provide Support Services for a Transitional Housing Program for 
Homeless Persons   
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide information regarding LD 599, An Act to Provide Support Services for a 
Transitional Housing Program for Homeless Persons . This bill would provide  $1,200,000 in 
ongoing funding for support services for a transitional housing progra m in Portland. In addition 
to low -barrier housing, the program intends to provide case management and support services to 
individuals who have medical, mental health , or substance use related needs and who are 
experiencing homelessness.  
 
DHHS recently est ablished the HOME Program, which is a new, Health Home service model 
under Section 91 that provides whole -person comprehensive case management, team -based care 
coordination, supports, and health promotion, and person -centered plans of care with 
comprehensi ve transitional care and follow up. This program provides support for programming 
like that outlined in this bill.  
 
While this pr ogramming is important, g iven the general fund impact, the Department does not 
support  the bill.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide information. We would be happy to answer questions 
from the Committee for the work session.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Anthony Pelotte, Director  
Office for Family Independence
