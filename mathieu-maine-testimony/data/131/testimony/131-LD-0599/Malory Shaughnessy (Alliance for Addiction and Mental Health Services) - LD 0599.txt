Testimony in Support of LD 599 
" An Act to Provide Support Services for a Transitional Housing 
Program for Homeless Persons " 
Sponsored by Representative Brennan  
April 14, 2023  
 
Good afternoon  Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and esteemed  
members of the Health and Human Services  Committees.   My name is  Malory 
Shaughnessy  and I am the Executive Director of the Alliance for Addiction and 
Mental Health Services. The Alliance is the statewide association representing 
the majority of Maineâ€™s community based mental health and substance use 
treatment providers , providing service s to over 80,000 Maine men, women, 
and children . The Alliance advocates for the implementation of sound policies 
and evidence -based practices that serve to enhance the quality and 
effectiveness of our behavioral health care system.  
I am here on behalf of t he Alliance in support of LD 599, An Act to Provide 
Support Services for a Transitional Housing Program for Homeless Persons.  
As you are hearing, LD 599 proposes additional state funding to contract for 
services delivered at temporary shelter facilities.  Provides ongoing funding for 
the department to contract for support services for a transitional housing 
program in Portland that provides low -barrier, 24 -hour, 7 -day-a week shelter, 
comprehensive case management and daily living support services to indivi duals 
experiencing homelessness who also have medical, mental health or substance 
use-related needs.  
Poverty, unemployment, and lack of affordable housing are commonly recognized 
causes of homelessness. These risk factors can be exacerbated by personal 
vulnerabilities such as  mental and substanc e use disorders1, trauma and 
violence2, domestic violence3, justice -system involvement, sudden serious illness, 
divorce, death of a partner, and disabilities.  
 
Supportive housing programs can help address the root causes of 
homelessness  through a range of essential  recovery support  services, including 
mental and substance use disorder treatment,  and employment  assistance .  
 
For all these reasons, the Alliance members urge you to vote ought to pass on     
LD 599.
