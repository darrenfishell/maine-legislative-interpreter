Testimony in support of LD 781, “An Act to Protect Nursing Home Residents by 
Implementing Silent Bed Alarms for Patients with Dementia ” Before the Joint Standing 
Committee of Health and Human Services 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services, my name is Ben Chipman, and I represent Senate 
District 28, which includes part of Portland in Cumberland County. I am before you today to 
introduce LD 781, “An Act to Protect Nursing Home Residents by Implementing Silent Bed 
Alarms for Patients with Dementia. ” 
This legislation would ensure that residents with dementia are protected from preventable deaths 
by installing silent bed and chair alarms to aleit on-duty medical staff when they get out of bed. 
Many residents of dementia are at risk of falling and other accidents that could lead to their 
deaths when they get up in the middle of the night. Requiring nursing homes to install silent bed 
and chair alarms would help medical staff ensure their safety, especially at night. Such systems 
also allow one of the nurses or CNA‘s to signal to the others that they can deal with the situation. 
Thank you for your consideration and I will bring more information to the work session.
