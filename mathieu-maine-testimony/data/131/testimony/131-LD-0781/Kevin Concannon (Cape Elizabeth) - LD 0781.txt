LD 781
Dear members of the Health and Human Services Committee 
I write to support LD 781 in the belief that it’s support can be a needed element in 
providing safety and support to both staff and impaired residents and patients of 
Maine facilities serving residents and patients who are suffering from Alzheimer’s 
disease or similar impairments.
We are much aware of the stresses and work challenges facing staff in long term care 
facilities across Maine.
Support for and commensurate reimbursement  for such devices in facilities can add 
an additional element to provide timely assistance to residents experiencing a fall 
while alerting staff to such incidents immediately.
I urge the Committee to support this LD 781 as a constructive step forward in 
strengthening Maine’s long term care facilities thereby enabling additional, timely 
care.
Yours truly,
Kevin W Concannon
