To: Marine Resources Committee From: MinotWeld Date: 04/21/2023 Re: Testimony in Support of LD 1058, An Act to Advance Greenhouse Gas Removal as an Economic Development Strategy in Maine__________________________________________________________Senator Bennett, Representative Gramlich and distinguished members of  Environment and Natural Resources committee.  My name is Minot Weld.  I am a resident of Mt. Desert Township in Hancock County.  I am writing to urge your support of  LD 1058. This is a timely and necessary bill.  It complements the Governor’s stated climate goals. Large scale deployment of greenhouse gas removal technologies is a crucial component in our effort to address climate change. I particularly applaud the bill’s provision for interagency consultation and coordination.  We need to work for full mission alignment across agencies.   This should be true of all state sponsored business development.  The carbon emissions of a single mammoth land based fish farm, for instance, can wipe out hard-won efficiencies incrementally gained elsewhere. It is counterproductive to pursue carbon reduction while at the same time enabling polluters. Regards, FM Weld
