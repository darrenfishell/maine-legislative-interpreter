The Department is opposed to this bill, for although it is well -intentioned, it is redundant 
given the ongoing activities of the Maine Climate Council and its workgroups.  I would 
first like to like to provide the Committee a brief refresher on the Adminis tration’s efforts 
to address Climate Change in Maine.   
 
On June 26, 2019, Governor Mills signed into law LD 1679, “An Act to Establish the 
Maine Climate Change Council to Assist Maine to Mitigate, Prepare and Adapt to 
Climate Change.”1  The Climate Counc il — an assembly of scientists, industry leaders, 
bipartisan local and state officials, and engaged citizens — was charged with 
developing a four-year Climate Action Plan to put Maine on a trajectory to decrease 
greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and 80% by 2050, and achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2045. Starting in September of 2019, the Climate Council along with 
working groups and a subcom mittee  began this work.  Maine’s Climate Action Plan, 
Maine Won’t Wait,  was released in December of 2020, and is the consensus result of 
months of study, dialogue, discussion, and public deliberation to determine the steps 
Maine must take to combat climate  change.2 
 
The Maine Won’t Wait  Climate Action Plan presents a number of principal strategies for 
addressing climate change in Maine:  
• Embrace the Future of Transportation in Maine  
• Modernize Maine’s Buildings: Energy Efficient, Smart and Cost -effective Hom es 
and Businesses  
• Reduce Carbon Emissions in Maine’s Energy and Industrial Sectors through Clean 
Energy and Innovation  
• Grow Maine’s Clean Energy Economy and Protect our Natural Resources 
Industries  
 
1 P.L. 2019, ch. 476.  
2 Maine’s Climate Action Plan has four overarching goals: 1) reducing gas emissions; 2) avoiding the 
impacts and costs of inaction; 3) fostering economic opportunity and prosperity; and 4) advancing equity 
through Maine’s climate response.

• Protect Maine’s Environment and Working Lands and Waters: Promote Natural 
Climate Solutions and Increase Carbon Sequestration  
• Build Healthy and Resilient Communities  
• Invest in Climate -Ready infrastructure  
• Engage with Maine people and Communities  
 
I’ve italicized several of these strategies to emphasize that the types of activities 
recommended by L.D. 1058  are already part of the Maine Won’t Wait Climate Action 
Plan, and work is already well underway on these initiatives.  
 
For example, scientists fr om the University of Maine, Bates College, Maine Forest 
Service, and the Maine Blue Carbon Network are actively working to improve carbon 
sequestration assessments throughout the state in an effort to update the Maine Carbon 
Budget.3  These data both assess our progress toward achieving carbon neutrality by 
2045 and inform strategies to increase carbon sequestration.  
   
In October 2021, the Governor’s Task Force on the Creation of a Forest Carbon 
Program produced a report outlining w ays carbon storage may be voluntarily increased 
on privately owned small -to-medium sized woodlots.4  These ambitious 
recommendations continue to be explored by the Natural and Working Lands Working 
Group and other stakeholders.  For example, last month (M arch 6, 2023) a new study 
was released by the Forest Carbon for Commercial Landowners Initiative demonstrating 
that shifts in forest management in Maine’s commercial timberlands could increase 
forest sequestration and storage while maintaining current harv est levels.5   
In 2022 , the Department was awarded funding to support a Land Cover Data Project 
that is currently underway.  Through this project, the Maine GeoLibrary and the Maine

DEP are partnering with several other organizations to collect land cover  data over the 
entire state of Maine.  This project will provide a high-resolution land cover and forestry 
data set for the entire state.   In addition, the University of Maine is using this land cover 
data to complete a state -wide high -resolution Forest Bi omass and Carbon Mapping 
Project specifically for the Maine DEP.  This carbon mapping project will assist in 
improving the Maine Carbon budget and our understanding of carbon sequestration 
across the state.  
In addition to these examples, numerous groups of  stakeholders are working on 
strategies for forest adaptation and resilience related to climate change.  Some of these 
stakeholder groups are focused on wood products, wildlife, and the landscape we leave 
for the next generation; however, all forest manage ment decisions are linked to carbon 
sequestration.   
As you can see, work on carbon sequestration is already well underway, and the 
Department and others are striving to leverage all available resources.  Thank you for 
your consideration in allowing this t estimony. I’m joined here today by  the Bureau of Air 
Quality’s Stacy Knapp, and together we would be happy to answer any questions that 
you might have.
