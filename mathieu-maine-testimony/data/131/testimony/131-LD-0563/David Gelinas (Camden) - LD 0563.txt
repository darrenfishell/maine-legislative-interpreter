Maine State Legislature 
Re: LD 563 
 
Members of the Marine Resources Committee, I am Captain David Gelinas of the Penobscot Bay and River Pilots 
Association.  I am a resident of Camden, in Knox County. Our association of state-licensed marine pilots is responsible for 
directing the navigation of large ocean-going commercial vessels in and out of Maine ports from Boothbay to Bar Harbor, 
and as far north as Bangor.  I speak to you today in opposition to LD 563. 
The rules regulating commercial shipping along America’s shores are well established under the authority of the Federal 
Government.  In order to participate in the free flow of international commerce, it is imperative that the nation speak 
with one voice with respect to our Territorial Sea.  LD 563 would directly conflict with this objective, and would introduce 
an entirely new regulatory landscape which could have dramatic, adverse impacts on Maine’s commercial maritime 
industry. 
This is not the first time that Maine has attempted to exercise jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit.  In 1975, the 
United State Supreme Court ruled decisively against the State of Maine, and multiple other coastal states, in seeking to 
extend State Waters out to the 12-mile Territorial Limit.  With the passage of time and the numerous international 
treaties and regulations that the United State has been a party to since then, we think it is highly unlikely that the highest 
court in the land would be willing to vacate their earlier opinion.  Maine does not need another costly legal battle, which 
passage of this bill would surely initiate.  Please vote “ought not to pass” on this proposed legislation.  Thank you for your 
consideration. 
 
Respectfully, 
 
David Gelinas
