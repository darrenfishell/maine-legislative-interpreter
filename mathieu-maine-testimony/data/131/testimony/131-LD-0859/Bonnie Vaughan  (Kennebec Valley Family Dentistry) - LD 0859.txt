Committee on Health and Human Services 
Testimony in Support 
May 8, 2023 10:00 am Public Hearing 
LD 859  An Act to Assess, Develop, Implement and Fund the Reuse of Existing 
Facilities at Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center to Provide Mental Health, Substance 
Use Disorder and Homelessness Services 
My name is Bonnie Vaughan IPDH, MEd, MBA.  My experience includes more than 
30 years in dental hygiene education, private practice and many years in dental 
public health ALL in Maine. I live in Cumberland and travel to Augusta everyday to 
be the Executive Director of a nonprofit center called Kennebec Valley Family 
Dentistry.  
I am speaking in support of LD 859 and needed services at Dorothea Dix. 
I’m also speaking to address another critical issue that could be provided at the 
Dorothea Dix Center. As Executive Director of the Kennebec Valley Family 
Dentistry Center.  We provide basic restorative and emergency dental care 
services for adults and children who are on MaineCare or who are uninsured. 
We TRY TO SEE MANY OF YOUR PATIENTS FROM THE DOROTHEA DIX CENTER.  
BUT MOST of YOUR PATIENTS ARE IN NEED OF GENERAL ENESTHESIA  IN ORDER 
TO RESTORE THEIR TEETH.  WE DO NOT DO GENERAL ANESTHESIA AND CANNOT 
FIND ANOTHER DENTAL CLINIC IN THE STATE THAT WILL TAKE THEM. 
IN THE 1990’S THERE WAS A CLINIC AT 63 PREBLE ST IN PORTLAND, THAT 
PROVIDED GENERAL ANESTESIA AND THERE WAS A DENTIST THERE TO PROVIDE 
RESTORATIVE CARE.  COULD THE COMMITTEE PLEASE LOOK AT RESTABLISHING 
THIS CRITICAL DENTAL CARE SERVICES.    
I would be very interested in supporting LD 859 but hope that you could also look 
at creating general anesthesia services for dental care for your clients.
