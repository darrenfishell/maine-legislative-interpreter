RE: LD 717  
 
Dear Senator Bailey and Representative  Perry : 
 
On behalf of the American Speech -Language -Hearing Association, I write to support  LD 717 , 
which adopt s the Audiology and Speech -Language Pathology Interstate Compact  (ASLP -IC). 
 
The American Speech -Language -Hearing Association (ASHA) is the national profes sional, 
scientific, and credentialing association for 228,000 members and affiliates who are 
audiologists; speech -language pathologists; speech, language, and hearing scientists; 
audiology and speech -language pathology support personnel; and students. Over 1,000  ASHA  
members reside in Maine .1 
 
ASHA members often ha ve difficult y obtaining multiple state licenses to practice due to 
administrative burdens. These burdens  hinder their ability to provide quality services and restrict 
consumer access in underserved and rural communities. I am pleased to support LD717 , which 
will address these issues by:  
• increasing access to care for patients, clients, and students; and 
• facilitating continuity of care when patients, clients, and students relocate or travel to 
another state, specifically members of the military and their spouses.  
 
Passage of this bill would allow Maine  to enjoy the same benefits of the 23 other ASLP -IC 
member s tates , including neighboring New Hampshire.  We hope the Commit tee will pass this 
important legislation  to ensure Maine  can join the ASLP -IC. 
 
If you or your staff have any questions, please contact Susan Adams , ASHA’s director of state 
legislative and regulatory affairs , at sadams@asha.org .  
 
Sincerely,
