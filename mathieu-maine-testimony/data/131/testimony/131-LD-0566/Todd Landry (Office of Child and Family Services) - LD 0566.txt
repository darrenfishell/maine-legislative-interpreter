Re:  LD 566 – An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault Services  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services : 
 
This letter is to provide information regarding LD 566, An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual 
Assault Services . This bill would provide additional funding for sexual assault services totaling 
$3.06 million over the biennium.  
 
OCFS does not take a position on the question of  increasing the funding for sexual assault 
services but would note that the bill does not include  specificity regarding how the money would 
be spent , what impact it is intended to  have for clients, and how the positive impact of the 
funding would be measured. OCFS’ Violence Prevention Unit oversees Maine’s contracts for 
both sexual assau lt services and domestic violence services, as such the increased funding 
proposed by LD 566 would flow through OCFS and OCFS would benefit from additional 
guidance regarding how this funding is to be used and what performance metrics should be 
utilized in  the contract to measure the benefit of this increased funding.  
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
Sincerely,  
       
      Dr. Todd A . Landry  
      Director  
      Office of Child and Family Services
