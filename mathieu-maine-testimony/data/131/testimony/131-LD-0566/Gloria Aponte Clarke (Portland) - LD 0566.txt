LD 566
Dear Members of Health and Human Services Committee:
 
My name is Gloria Aponte Clarke and I am a resident of Portland. 
 
I am submitting testimony in support of LD 566, An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault 
Services.
Sexual assault impacts too many people in Maine and more services and better funded staff 
are needed. Sexual assault prevention and emergency services take a great amount of care 
and knowledge of many different systems of care and justice. The people who work in this 
field are helping all Mainers by creating a Maine where sexual assault is a rarity and survivors
are provided the best care possible. This is very hard and heartfelt work and the base salary 
is $45,000 per year. In today's economy this is not a wage that is competitive or compensates
for the skill and expertise needed to do this work. Please consider increasing funding for 
sexual assault services in Maine. We all will benefit.
Thank you for your consideration,
Gloria
