Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of Health and Human Services 
Committee:
 
My name is Catherine Besteman and I am a resident of Portland and a member of the 
Parole-4-Maine citizenâ€™s collective
 
I am submitting testimony in support of LD 566, An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault 
Services.
We need to change our approach to sexual assault in Maine in all kinds of ways, including 
providing support to those working on the front line in support of people who have been 
harmed.  We have an opportunity to enact culture change in Maine around healing, repair, 
and transformative justice, but the only way to do that is to invest our resources into programs
of support, healing, and repair. We are failing to do that in Maine right now. Please support 
LD 566.
Sincerely,
Catherine Besteman
