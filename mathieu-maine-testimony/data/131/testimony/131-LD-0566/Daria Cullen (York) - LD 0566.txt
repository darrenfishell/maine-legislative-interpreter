LD 566
My name is Daria Cullen. I reside in York Maine. I'm writing to you today in full 
support of LD 566 â€“ An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault Services. This bill
will ensure Maine has the best quality services and resources available to survivors of 
sexual violence. It will help to keep advocates sustained in this complex, extremely 
difficult, and critical work by offering increased wages for advocates and funding for 
allied organizations. Advocates are on the frontlines showing up for survivors every 
day - we need to do the same. I ask that you please vote in favor of LD 566 and I'm 
hopeful for a unanimous out to pass. Thank you.
