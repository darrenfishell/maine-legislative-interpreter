LD 566
I would like to voice my support for LD 566: An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault 
Services. I have been working as an Recovery Coach for the past 8 years  and 90% of my 
recoveree's has had some type of sexual assault committed against them that they are trying 
to deal with it doesn't work alone. These women our women in our community need help from
trained professionals. These women turn to drugs to numb the feeling of being violated 
because there is little to no help available if they are offered any help at all. They will do 
anything to make the thought or feeling of being violated go away or for them to forget.
The State should  invest just as much money on the emotional and mental health of the 
people that are victims of a crime, as they do on the prison system.
