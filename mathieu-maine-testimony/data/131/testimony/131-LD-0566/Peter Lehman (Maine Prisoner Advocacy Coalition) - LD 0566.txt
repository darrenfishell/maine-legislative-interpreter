March 27, 2023  
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services:  
 
My name is Peter Lehman and I live in Thomaston. I am a formerly 
incarcerated citizen and a person in long -term recovery. * I am 
testifying in favor of LD 566 on beha lf of the Maine Prisoner 
Advocacy Coalition  whose goal is to promote restorative practices 
in order to increase public safety and the health of our community.   
 
Almost all of the people we work with, men and women,  have 
been the victims of abuse and especiall y sexu al abuse. This is 
generally related to or connected to their own offending  and 
abuse.  
 MECASAâ€™ s sexual assault prevention and response service workers 
are heroes on the front lines in trying to address and break this 
tragic intergenerational cycle . 
 
We applaud thei r work and s trongly urge you to su pport them . 
 
Please unanimously vote Ought to  Pass on LD 566.
