Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of Health and Human Services 
Committee:
 
My name is Jon Courtney and I am a resident of Cape Elizabeth.
I am submitting testimony in support of LD 566, An Act to Provide Funding for 
Sexual Assault Services.
As a former nonprofit worker, I am intimately aware of the toil and constant depletion
that those sector workers experience in trying to maintain their dedication to their 
work. Sexual assault service workers play a critical role in helping to prevent or 
address harm within the community fabric - a service that is dependent on both skilled
experience and the ability to maintain a sensitivity to the labor.  Additionally SA 
support organizations provide much needed structure but require adequate funding to 
continue this taxing work. Increased wages will help to both recruit and maintain 
compassionate workers while guarding against burnout and fatigue. 
Thank you for your work.  I hope you will support LD 566.
Jon Courtney
