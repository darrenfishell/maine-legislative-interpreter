Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee: 
LD 974, An Act to Establish Minimum Pav for Educational Technicians and Other School 
Support Staff. proposes that beginning October 1, 2023 and every January 1st thereafter, a school 
administrative unit (SAU) must establish a minimum wage for educational technicians that is 
equal to 133% of the minimum wage established in the Maine Revised Statutes, and a minimum 
wage for other school support staff that is equal to 125% of the minimum wage. 
The Department of Education, and the Mills Administration, agree that minimum salary is still 
too low for Maine educators. The Maine education community continues to struggle with an 
educator workforce shortage. Our ed techs and other school support staff are a valuable 
resource to our education field, and increasing the minimum salary for these positions is an 
important aspect of growing and strengthening the Maine educator Workforce. 
Title 20-A, §l5671 outlines several deﬁnitions for various levels of school staff as related to the 
Essential Programs and Services (EPS) funding fonnula. The Department of Education does not 
collect the needed detail of salary data for these positions. As such, We are not able to account for 
the Ways LD 974 may impact State education funding and SAU budgets. 
The Department will be available to provide additional information on LD 974 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work session. 
Sincerely,
