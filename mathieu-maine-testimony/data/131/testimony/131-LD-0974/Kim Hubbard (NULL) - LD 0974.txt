Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee, 
My name is Kim Hubbard and I’ve been an Educational Technician for almost 20 
years now. I don’t know anyone who is doing this job because the money is great, 
l’m certainly not. Every year our district loses very good people because they just 
can’t afford to stay. How many people do you know, with a four-year degree, 
make a career out of a job paying $16.34 or less an hour? Most ESPs are either 
married to someone with a good income or have to take on a second or third job 
(yes three jobs!) to make ends meet. 
We aren’t talking about a cashier’s job here. We are the people you entrust your 
children with. We are expected to not only teach lesson plans, sometimes created 
by us, but to also understand the needs of the whole child. You expect us to assist 
in their education as well as to keep your children safe from attacks, report 
suspected abuse, be kicked, bitten, and spit on, cover a classroom when the teacher 
is absent, and continue our own education to keep our certifications, all while 
presenting a positive outlook. Yet your school districts pay us less than a Walmart 
shelf-stocker. 
One of my students, who also happens to be a Special Olympian, just started a job 
stocking shelves at Walmart for $19.00 an hour. After dedicating twenty years in 
the same district, with a 4-year degree, I make $19.16 an hour. 
You want us to be professionals, pay us like professionals! 
Respectfully, 
Kim Hubbard
