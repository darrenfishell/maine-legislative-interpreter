LD 1526 
An Act to Provide Grants to Support Reading Proficiency Programming in Schools 
May 2, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan, and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Rita Furlow. I am the Senior Policy An- 
alyst at the Maine Children's Alliance. lam here today in support of LD 1526, An Act to Provide Grants to 
Support Reading Proficiency Programming in Schools. The Maine Children's Alliance is a statewide non- 
partisan, non-profit research and advocacy organization whose mission is to promote sound public poli- 
cies to improve the lives of children, youth, and families in Maine. 
At the Maine Children's Alliance, we believe that Maine's future success depends upon how our children 
are doing today. We know from research that reading proficiently by the end of third grade is particularly 
important because it is closely correlated with success throughout school and life. Through third grade, 
children are learning to how read. After third grade, they are reading to learn. Mastery of reading be- 
comes a critical component in children's ability to keep up academically by third grade. 
in 2010, the Annie E. Casey Foundation released a seminal report on the importance of young children 
learning to read — Early Warning! Why Reading by the End of Third Grade Matters. The report found that 
children who read proficiently by the end of third grade are more likely to graduate from high school and 
are more likely to ﬁnd a job that can adequately support their families. The report brought much atten- 
tion to the importance of early reading and literacy. 
Unfortunately, too few children are mastering the early reading skills they will need to succeed in a world 
economy that requires a highly educated workforce. Maine's reading scores over the past decade have 
been stagnant. Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) highlights the income 
disparities that exist on Maine's 4"‘ grade reading. The 2022 NAEP report for Maine found a 26 point dif- 
ferent between those who are eligible vs not eligible for school lunch.

Teaching children how to read is a fundamental responsibility of our schools. We should ensure that all 
teachers in Maine have the tools they need to teach reading. We support efforts to provide funding to 
improve reading proﬁciency in Maine —- particularly for early elementary (Pre-K through Grade 3) school 
teachers. We urge the committee to amend the language in the bill to limit any funding to programs and 
practices that are based on cognitive and scientific research. We should be providing funding to programs 
that we know are effective and evidence based. The committee should also consider whether the Depart- 
ment of Education could provide this training across the state - see pages 11-12 of the Department re- 
port. 
Improving children's early reading skills is an essential step toward increasing the number of children who 
will succeed academically and do well in life. We urge the committee to view this bill as the beginning of 
an effort to ensure that all Maine children become proficient readers. The report and appendix document 
from the Department provide the Committee with a start on ways to improve how children learn to read 
in our state. Changing decades of practice will not happen overnight and ultimately must include changes 
at teacher preparation programs. We urge you to make a start by supporting this legislation. 
Thank you for your consideration and attention to this important issue.
