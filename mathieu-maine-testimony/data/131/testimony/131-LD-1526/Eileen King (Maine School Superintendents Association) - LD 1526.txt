TESTIMONY NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 1526  
 
AN ACT TO PROVIDE GR ANTS TO SUPPORT READING  
PROFICIENCY PROGRAMM ING IN SCHOOLS  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee. I am Eileen King, executive director of the Maine School Super-
intendents Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine 
School Superintendents Association, neither for nor against L.D. 1526.  
 
Reading has many benefits for students, from inspiring the imagination to improving 
academic abilities. When students embrace the importance of reading, they can reach 
their full potential. Reading is also a vital part of the brain ’s development. It requires 
more focus and uses more areas of the brain than passive activities like watching vid-
eos.  
 
This bill asks that the department give special consideration to SAUs serving popula-
tions of students with identified reading proficiency gaps for economically disad-
vantages student and racial and ethnic populations.  
 
MSSA supports the improvement of reading proficiency for all Maine students and 
would like to see a broader dissemination of these funds across Maine schools.
