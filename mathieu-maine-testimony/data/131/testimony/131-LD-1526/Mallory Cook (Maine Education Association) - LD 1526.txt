May 2, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and other esteemed members of the Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs, 
My name is Mallory Cook (pronouns she/her/hers), and I am the Director of Training and Early 
Educator Engagement at the Maine Education Association, and a certiﬁed English teacher and Building 
Administrator. I am here to provide testimony in support of LD 1526: An Act to Provide Grants to 
Support Reading Proﬁciency Programming in Schools. 
According to 21-22 data reported on Maine DOE’s ESSA Dashboard ‘ , 16.2% (13,382) of students are 
below or well below state expectations in English Language Arts. A breakdown of those numbers shows 
demographic inequities; the grant funding proposed in this bill would allocate funds to districts, 
hopefully with support from the Department ’s experts to enhance their literacy programming. MEA is 
hopeful that when establishing criteria, the Department prioritizes districts that have the highest 
percentage of students below/well below state expectations, especially demographic groups that are 
disproportionally impacted.

Today you have been presented with data from the Department and literacy leaders in our state that 
show the growing need for this investment — that literacy is a human right and essential to an 
individual ’s health, success, income, relationships, and involvement in their community. Because the

stakes are so high, we are hopeful these grant funds are built around parameters that do not endorse a 
single canned curriculum or program. As is evident from today’s hearing, literacy is not and will never 
be simple and settled. Our best tools in delivering effective instruction already exist in our schools — the 
educators who work with students every day; therefore, these funds should be used to call on the experts 
in our state to provide cross-curricular training around the most important tenets of literacy: phonetic 
awareness, phonics, vocabulary, ﬂuency, comprehension, and writing. 
The DOE’s report for LD 138, Resolve, Regarding Reading Proﬁciency Data Analysis, references a 
Dyslexia Survey (Flanagan and Will, 2022) that demonstrates that only 33.5% of surveyed teachers felt 
conﬁdent in their reading instruction for students with dyslexia? The Dyslexia Foundation shows that 
15-20% of the population show symptoms of dyslexia. Furthermore, 85% of those who qualify for 
special services have a disability in reading and language processing.3 For these reasons, it is essential 
we provide our educators with the on-going professional learning they need to provide students with the 
support they require. This includes teachers and support staff who work directly with students. 
LD l526 also calls for routine technical rulemaking to govern procedures, criteria, and priorities for 
awarding grants. The MEA would be happy to share our views and to work alongside the department in 
the development of those rules. 
This is a great opportunity to provide enhanced literacy instruction for many students in our state. We 
urge the committee to vote ought to pass. Thank you and I will do my best to answer any questions you 
may have.
