Testimony of Representative Jennifer Poirier presenting 
LD 1956 “An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Optometrists ” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services, I am Jennifer Poirier, andI 
proudly represent House District 70, which is comprised of Skowhegan. I am pleased to stand 
before you today to present LD 1956, An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Optometrists. 
I was asked to sponsor this bill on behalf of the State Board of Optometry, so I will keep my 
introduction short. Experts like Dr. Thomas Nadeau, testifying after me, are better suited to 
answer any questions you may have you may have about the bill. 
It is my understanding that the bill aligns the laws governing Optometry with current statutes and 
applies much needed updates and revisions. 
I hope the committee will give thought and consideration to this proposal and I respectfully ask 
you to support LD 1956. Thank you for allowing me to present this bill. I would be glad to 
answer any questions you may have.
