Education & Cultural Affairs Committee, Maine State Legislature  
LD 1042 Public Comment 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Committee,  thank you for 
allowing public comment on this bill and one of the suggested amendments. My name is Robert 
Reed, and I am the Executive Director for the Maine Chiropractic Association.   
The MCA fully supports LD 1042 and the wishes of the legislature to ensure the safety of the 
student athlete. Failure to correctly diagnose and/or treat these conditions has potential long 
term effects on the individual that we must prevent whenever possible. 
We do, however, take issue with the amendment put forth by the Maine Medical Association 
which would limit which healthcare providers can diagnose and/or treat these injuries. Instead, 
we support the original language of a healthcare provider who is acting within the scope of 
their license and who has been trained and/or certified in regard to concussions.  Maine 
already faces a significant healthcare provider shortage and limiting the ability to diagnose and 
treat to any one or more groups is not in the best interest of the patient and could limit the 
ability of the patient to get care quickly and effectively. 
We respectfully ask that the bill be approved as originally intended and to remove any 
amendment language that limits the ability to diagnose or treat when the healthcare provider 
has the expertise, training and/or certification to do so in a safe manner.  The scope of practice 
for any healthcare professional already ensures the ability to diagnose and treat. 
   
Respectfully Submitted, 
Robert Reed, Executive Director 
Maine Chiropractic Association
