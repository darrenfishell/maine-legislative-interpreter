This document may be well intended, however, is lacking many important 
components that protect both student athletes and health care professionals. This 
proposed legislation does not take into account individual youth organizations, how to
track these proposed changes, nor does it take into account athletes that may have 
socioeconomic boundaries that would prevent them from obtaining these aggressive 
guidelines. The language describing head injury is not detailed enough, as head injury
vs concussion are different, not to mention the overwhelming demand these would 
place on health care providers if this passes due to the poor language. The title of this 
proposed legislation is also itself an issue, concussion and injury prevention protocols 
should be separate, as they are two separate entities. Again, may be well intended, but
not nearly detailed enough to protect all parties involved, also, who is tracking all 
these requested things? Liability? Consent? All organizations using the same 
platform? Many issues. Happy to discuss more and send along my personal edits and 
comments on this proposed legislation.
