LD 1042
Good morning,
LD 1042 was brought to my attention last week by a number of Primary Care Sports 
Medicine providers and numerous members of my allied health care team members.  I
would like to take the opportunity to express my concerns for the lack of medical 
knowledge and ideas put forth in this bill.   For years numerous health professionals 
across not only the United States but the world have researched, studied and 
recommended the best practices for concussion management both within sports as 
well as academics and long-term care.  This bill has many issues, most of which is to 
long to address within a written testimony.  However, this bill has no place with the 
current recommendations and medical best practice.  It is poorly written, does not 
support medical data, and leaves to many areas of confusion in treatment and care of 
traumatic brain injuries here in Maine.  
As a representative of the profession of Athletic Training, the Maine Athletic Trainers
Association, the National Athletic Trainers Assocation on Practice Advancement as 
well as Maine Medical Partners Orthopedics and Sports Medicine along with all my 
colleagues at MaineHealth this bill should not go to legislators for vote as this clearly 
and directly puts our children in harm's way with the current wording.  I am extremely
disappointed in the lack of medical knowledge and best practice within this bill and 
those willing to sponsor it.
