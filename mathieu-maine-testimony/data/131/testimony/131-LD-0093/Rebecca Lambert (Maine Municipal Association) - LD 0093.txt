In Support of  
 
LD 93 -  An Act to Ensure Access for All Caregivers to Diaper Changing Stations in Public Restrooms  
 
March 29, 2023  
 
 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and members of the Innovation, Development, Economic 
Advancement and Business Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert and I am providing testimony in support of LD 93 on behalf of Maine Municipal Association’s (MMA) elec ted 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.   
 Municipal officials pride themselves on their dedication to providing ne eded services and assistance to 
the residents within their borders.  Likewise, local leaders want their residents to feel welcome and comfortable entering public buildings and that includes individuals with children. Assessing your child’s bathrooms needs cannot always be anticipated and having diaper changing stations available to individuals if the need arises while conducting business with the municipality, only further extends that consideration.  
 The amendment provided for LD 93 notes a provision that would exclude buildings where significant 
construction would be required and deemed not financially feasible to install the diaper changing station, 
in addition to alterations that would conflict with current rules adopted by the Maine Historic Preservatio n 
Commission or alterations that would bring the building out of compliance with current building codes. 
Some small municipalities have buildings that would fall under these exceptions and appreciate the recognition that in some instances this measure coul d be cost prohibitive.  
 Thank you for your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
