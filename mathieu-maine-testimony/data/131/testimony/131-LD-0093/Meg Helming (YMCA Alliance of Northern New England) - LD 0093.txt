Testimony of Meg Helming before 
the Committee On Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business
in support of
LD 93: An Act to Ensure Access for All Caregivers to Diaper Changing Stations in 
Public Restrooms
March 28, 2023
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and distinguished members of the Committee On 
Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business, my name is Meg Helming and 
I’m the COO for the YMCA Alliance of Northern New England, which represents the 15 YMCAs in 
Maine. The YMCA supports LD 93: An Act to Ensure Access for All Caregivers to Diaper Changing 
Stations in Public Restrooms.
As one of the largest youth-serving organizations in the country, and in Maine, the YMCA 
supports policies that support families. We see this legislation as a sensible policy to make being 
out and about with little ones a bit less challenging. We all know that parents of young children 
need all the help they can get in that regard!
You may or may not know that this legislation was written by a Maine high school student in the 
YMCA Youth & Government program, a mock government program that culminates in more than 
125 highschoolers taking over the State House for a weekend in November. This rigorous 
program teaches participants about the legislative process, but more importantly, strong 
leadership skills and how to engage in respectful dialogue even when they disagree. We 
appreciate Representative Collamore willingness to sponsor this legislation on our youth leader’s 
behalf.
We urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 93.
Respectfully submitted,
YMCA Alliance of Northern New England
