Protect Maine’s Fishing Heritage Testimony on LD 1951 “An Act Regarding 
Marine Finﬁsh Aquaculture. ” 
May 25, 2023 
Good afternoon, Chairwoman Reny, Chairwoman Hepler and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Marine Resources. My name is Mark Gallagher, and I am a senior 
consultant and shareholder at Drummond Woodsum Strategic Consulting located in Portland. I 
appear in front of your committee today on behalf of my client, Protect Maine’s Fishing 
Heritage. 
Protect Maine’s Fishing Heritage is a statewide coalition working to protect Maine’s ﬁshing 
heritage so all Mainers can earn a living and recreate along our iconic coast. We are established 
as a 501 C4 social welfare organization and we are focused on advocating for along range and 
collaborative plan to permit our public oceans, appropriately. We are gravely concerned about 
the current and extremely ﬂawed aquaculture permitting process being led by the Department of 
Marine Resources. We are also concerned about the potential of large scale, industrial, on-water 
aquaculture destroying our public natural resources and the potential for a strong, small owner 
operated aquaculture industry in Maine. 
Protect Maine’s Fishing Heritage is testifying neither for nor against LD 1951 “An Act 
Regarding Marine Finﬁsh Aquaculture. ” It is our position that any discussion related to smart 
and forward-thinking planning for our coastline is beneﬁcial. We commend Senator Grohoski 
for submitting this legislation and for her tireless advocacy for our public resources. It is our 
hope that this legislation could evolve into statute which implements a statewide study 
committee that examines the on-water aquaculture permitting process, and make suggestions for 
legislation that addresses the ﬂaws in the current system. 
Thank you for allowing myself and Protect Maine’s Fishing Heritage to address you this 
afternoon.
