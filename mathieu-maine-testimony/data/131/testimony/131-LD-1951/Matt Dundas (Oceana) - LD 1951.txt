Testimony of Matt Dundas 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources 
In FAVOR of LD 1951 
An Act Regarding Marine Finﬁsh Aquaculture 
Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Marine Resources, I am Matt Dundas of Cumberland. I am the Maine-based campaign 
director with Oceana, the largest international advocacy organization focused solely on ocean 
conservation. I am testifying before you today in support of L.D. 1951, An Act Regarding 
Marine Finfish Aquaculture because it will protect Maine’s coast by setting a clear limit to the 
density of marine ﬁnﬁsh farms. 
When it comes to the health of Maine’s ocean, we can’t mess aromd. Our commercial ﬁshing 
and tourism industries contribute billions of dollars annually to our economy and the ocean is the 
foundation of our culture, our history, and our identity. Protecting Maine’s iconic coastline from 
pollution must always be a top priority. 
This is why American Aquafarms was one of the least popular proposals in memory. If built as 
proposed, the facility would have been one of the largest marine salmon farms on earth, releasing 
4.1 billion gallons of polluted Wastewater per day into Frenchman Bay, one of Maine’s most 
beloved and ecologically sensitive waterways. It would have brought heavy industry, including 
diesel generators, lights, and increased barge trafﬁc to the doorstep of Acadia National Park. Due 
to these factors and many more, the project was opposed by Gov. Janet Mills and former Gov. 
Paul LePage. In a poll commissioned by Oceana and undertaken by Beacon Strategies in March, 
2022, two-thirds of Hancock County voters and a majority of voters statewide opposed the 
project. It was opposed by Democrats and Republicans. _ 
If Maine had a stocking density limit like the ones around the World, American Aquafanns never 
could have applied for permits for this massive project in the ﬁrst place. 
Stocking density is a critical metric that is capped no higher than 25 kilograms of ﬁsh per cubic 
meter of Water (25kg/m3) by govermnents and internal corporate policies all around the World
because it is a key barometer of water quality and ﬁsh health. Densities higher than 25kg/m3 
have been linked to water quality issues such as decreased levels of dissolved oxygen and 
increased levels of CO2 and ammonia, which can lead to serious ﬁsh health problems, including 
skin and ﬁn damage. 
This is why Norway, which produces roughly half the World’s farmed salmon, has a national 
stocking density limit of 25kg/m3. Chile, which is second behind Norway in salmon production, 
with another 20% of the global market, has a 17kg/m3 stocking density limit. 
All around the world, aquaculture companies and industry associations have internal policies that 
establish limits no higher than 25kg/m3 for marine ﬁnﬁsh farming. It is understood that going 
higher than 25kg/m3 is risky for water quality and ﬁsh health. The Canadian Aquaculture 
Industry Alliance, of which Maine’s only marine salmon company Cooke Aquaculture, isa 
member, includes a maximum stocking density of 25kg/m3 in their binding code of conduct. 
And Mowi, the world’s largest marine salmon company, also limits density to 25kg/m3 asa 
matter of internal policy. 
25kg/m3 also appears to be the internal limit for Cooke Aquaculture here in Maine, which owns 
all 24 existing marine ﬁnﬁsh farm leases in the state, all of which are pennitted to go as dense as 
30kg/m3. In the last 12 months, Cooke only breached 25kg/m3 ﬁve times in more than 1,600 
reported pen months with ﬁsh in the pens, 99.7% of the time, despite having a higher legal 
allowance. This is no surprise, given that Cooke also operates below 25kg/m3 at their farms in 
Canada, Chile, and Scotland, all of which have some form of government or corporate limit that 
is no higher than 25kg/m3. 25kg/m3 is the widely accepted high-water mark for marine ﬁnﬁsh 
pen stocking density limits. 
American Aquafarms proposed a stocking density of 40kg/m3 for its Frenchman Bay proposal. 
This is a ludicrous and offensive number that would have rendered this project dead on arrival in 
most places around the world, but not in Maine because our state has no limit on the stocking 
density of marine ﬁnﬁsh farms.
Maine is the only state in the U.S. that allows marine salmon farms in state waters. Last year, 
Washington joined Alaska, Oregon, and California in banning marine salmon farming in state- 
controlled waters. To the extent that Maine wants to have aquaculture practices are sustainable, 
the state must enact a stocking density limit our coastal waters are not the target of international 
corporations seeking to take advantage of our inadequate ocean protections. 
Two additional areas of concern regarding proposals the scale of American Aquafarms remain 
unaddressed by this bill, which are the biomass and location of the proposal. Oceana also sees 
these as vulnerabilities in Maine’s aquaculture regulations. There is currently no limit to the 
biomass of marine ﬁnﬁsh farm proposals in Maine, which is what allowed American Aquafarms 
to propose a maximum biomass of 9,200 metric tons for each of their two Frenchman Bay sites. 
The total biomass of 18,400 metric tons would have exceeded the total biomass of all 24 existing 
marine salmon farms in Maine combined and would have made American Aquafarms one of the 
largest marine salmon farms on the planet by biomass. Oceana encourages the state of Maine to 
urgently enact a biomass limit for marine ﬁnﬁsh farm proposals to round out its regulatory 
framework. 
Additionally, We strongly believe that Frenchman Bay must be made permanently off-limits to 
marine ﬁnﬁsh fanns due to its fragile ecosystem, low ﬂush rate, high nutrient loads, and cultural 
and economic signiﬁcance. 
Maine’s ocean deﬁnes our identity and our sense of place. I urge you to protect our coast and our 
communities by voting in favor on L.D. 1951. 
Thank you for your time and I am happy to answer questions from the committee.

To The Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources: 
Maine's pristine waters are at risk, threatened by massive 
industrial fish farms that could forever change our coasts 
and waterways. The recent proposal by American 
Aquafarms exposed that Maine is vulnerable, as there are 
no clear limits to the size, density, and location of fish 
farms in state waters. 
If allowed to move forward, American Aquafarms would 
build the biggest salmon farm in North America, the size of 
15 football fields and within half a mile of the shore of 
Acadia National Park. 
Without clear limits on the books, Maine's waters are 
vulnerable to future farms that are too big and too risky. 
L.D. 1951, An Act Regarding Marine Finfish Aquaculture, 
directly plugs one of the holes in Maine's rules by enacting 
a density limit for marine finfish farms. This would have 
the effect of preventing another proposal like American 
Aquafarms from coming to Maine. 
We respectfully urge you to please vote Ought to Pass on 
L.D. 1951, An Act Regarding Marine Finfish Aquaculture. 
Sincerely,V
Maine Residents in Support of Common-Sense Aquaculture Regulations in the State
