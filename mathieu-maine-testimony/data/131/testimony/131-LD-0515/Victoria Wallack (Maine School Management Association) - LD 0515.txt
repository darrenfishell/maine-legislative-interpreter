TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO
L.D. 515
AN ACT TO REQUIRE SCHOOL BOARD APPROVAL OF SUPERINTENDENT
RULES AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I
am Victoria Wallack, director of communications and government relations for Maine School Management
Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and
Maine School Superintendents Association, in opposition to L.D. 515.
This bill would require School Board approval of all rules and procedures, including hiring and the day-to-day
operation of schools. That is counterintuitive to the process we have in place today, where School Boards
adopt policy to guide but not mandate how superintendents and other administrators run our schools.
The number of policies adopted by the local School Board are quite extensive. Policy manuals are publicly
available, with the majority posted on the district’s website or available by request. Current statute requires
Maine school boards to adopt policy; Title 20-A, §1001, 1-A Adoption of Policies.
It is and has been the intent that administrative procedures, needed to outline and describe steps needed to
implement the policy, would be crafted and designed at the superintendent level with assistance from school
unit directors and administrators. While adopted policy may remain constant and not be necessary to change,
the procedures needed to implement the policy may change and may change even several times during the
school year.
The proposed requirement to have all procedures, subsequent to the adopted policy, also be approved by the
school board is both unnecessary as well as a costly requirement. The public notice requirement in this bill is
problematic. It would not allow school administrators to change procedures based on circumstances that
require prompt attention until a notice is published in a local newspaper. That ties the hands of our
administrators to react quickly to situations.
Legal notices also cost money and should not be required for everything we do.
There are times when procedures are embedded within a policy, and the school board would vote to consider
the policy/procedure for approval. An example of this would be Policy BEDH on public participation. There
are also other times when procedures are attached to a policy and also be considered for approval. An example
of this would be Policy JICK that has the policy and four separate exhibits/procedures.
Overall, this bill is extremely cumbersome and would not allow school administrators to change procedures
when situations and circumstances change. That is not in the best interest of the students we serve and the
people we employ.
*MSMA SAMPLE POLICY* NEPN/NSBA Code: BEDH
[NOTE: School Boards are required by current law to provide an opportunity for
public comment, limited to school and education matters, at full meetings of the
Board (20-A MRSA § 1001(20). Boards may impose reasonable time, place and
manner restrictions on expressive activity during the public comment period to
ensure that the Board’s business meeting is not disrupted and to ensure compliance
with confidentiality and privacy laws.
Boards should check other related policies (such as those pertaining to agenda
preparation, Board meetings, agenda format, etc.) to ensure that there are no
inconsistencies with revisions to this policy, and update those policies and all cross
references as necessary.]
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS
The primary purpose of School Board meetings is to conduct the business of the Board
related to Board policies, programs, and operations. The Board encourages residents to
attend Board meetings so that they may become acquainted with the operations and
programs of the schools.
The Board also recognizes the value of public comments on school and educational
matters. To permit fair and orderly expression of public comments at Board business
meetings while still allowing the Board to conduct its business efficiently, the Board has
established the procedure below for regular business meetings.
At special, emergency, or workshop meetings, public comments will be limited to the
topic(s) of the particular meeting.
[NOTE: The public comment law simply refers to “full meetings of the board,”
without making a distinction between the various kinds of meetings that are
typically held. MSMA/DWM believe that it is acceptable to limit public comment at
special, emergency, and workshop meetings to the topic(s) for which the meeting is
held. Boards may delete the above sentence if they wish to allow general comments.
The law makes it clear that public comment is not required at subcommittee
meetings.]
In addition to speaking during the designated public comment portion of the agenda at
Board meetings, members of the public are welcome to submit written comments on
school and educational matters to the Board and Superintendent, or to submit requests to
have items placed on a Board agenda, in accordance with applicable Board policies.
[NOTE: The law does not specify where the public comment period should be
placed on the agenda or how much public comment should be allowed. For
efficiency, it may make sense to place the public comment early in the agenda.
Page 1 of 3
MAINE SCHOOL MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
NEPN/NSBA Code: BEDH
1. The Board will include a public comment period, not to exceed 30 minutes [Or:___
minutes] on the agenda of its regular business meetings. Comments by individuals are
limited to a maximum of three (3) minutes [OR: ____ minutes] at a meeting. Individuals
may not relinquish a portion of their allotted time to another speaker. The time limits in
this paragraph may be modified at a particular meeting at the discretion of the Board.
[NOTE: Boards have the option of prioritizing comments from residents of the
school unit. There are two options below that Boards may wish to consider.
MSMA/DW suggest having a sign-in form for individuals to speak, which includes
the individual’s name and town/city of residence. Boards may also choose not to
have a sign-in form, or only to use one in circumstances where there are many
individuals wishing to speak at a regular meeting.]
2.[OPTION 1] Individuals who wish to speak during the public comment period are
required to fill out the sign-in form available at each Board meeting, prior to the
beginning of the public comment period, and to review a copy of this policy. Each
individual will be required to state their name and town/city of residence before
beginning their remarks.
[OPTION 2] The Board will hear public comments from residents of the school unit
first. If there is time remaining in the public comment period once all residents have had
the opportunity to speak, the Board will permit comments from non-residents. Individuals
who wish to speak are required to fill out the sign-in form available at each Board
meeting, prior to the beginning of the public comment period, and review a copy of this
policy Each individual will be required to state their name and town/city of residence
before beginning their remarks.
3.The Board Chair is responsible for ensuring the orderly conduct of Board meetings and
for ensuring compliance with this policy, including the following rules of order:
a.Speakers will be recognized by the Board Chair, and comments should be
addressed to the Board Chair. Requests for information or concerns that require
further research may be referred to the superintendent for further action, if
necessary;
b.Speakers are expected to follow rules of common etiquette and decorum,
including refraining from using vulgar and/or obscene language, yelling,
threatening others using words or by other actions, making defamatory
comments, or otherwise engaging in any activity that disrupts orderly meeting
progress. Examples of disruptive conduct include, but are not limited to,
exceeding the allotted time limits, talking over or interrupting others, offering
repetitive comments, and offering comment on matters unrelated to the school
unit’s programs, policies, or operations.

MAINE SCHOOL MANAGEMENT ASSOCATION
NEPN/NSBA Code: BEDH
c.Discussion of personnel matters is not permitted during the public comment
period due to the privacy, confidentiality and due process rights of school unit
employees. For purposes of this policy, “discussion of a personnel matter”
means any discussion of job performance or conduct of a school unit
employee, including complaints about them.
d.Discussion of matters involving individual students are also not permitted
during the public comment period due to the privacy, confidentiality, and due
process rights of the school unit’s students.
e.Any concerns about personnel matters and/or student matters should be
directed to the Superintendent or another appropriate administrator outside of
Board meetings so that they can be addressed through an alternative channel
and in a manner consistent with privacy, confidentiality, and due process rights
of the individuals involved.
f.The Board Chair will stop any public comment that is contrary to these rules.
g. Individuals who disrupt a Board meeting may be asked to leave in order to
allow the Board to conduct its business in an orderly manner. The Board Chair
may request the assistance of law enforcement if necessary to address disruptions
or safety concerns.

*MSMA SAMPLE POLICY* NEPN/NSBA Code: JICK
BULLYING
The Board believes that bullying ,including cyberbullying, is detrimental to student well-
being and to student learning and achievement. It interferes with the mission of the

affects not only students who are targets but also those who participate in and witness
such behavior.
Bullying Prohibited
Bullying, including “cyberbullying,” harassment and sexual harassment are not
acceptable conduct in [School unit name] and are prohibited.
Retaliation for the reporting of incidents of such behavior is also prohibited.
In adopting this policy, it is not the Board’s intent to prohibit students from expressing
their ideas, including religious, political and philosophical views that may offend the
sensibilities of others, or from engaging in civil debate. However, the Board does not
condone and will take action in response to conduct that directly interferes with students’
rights at school under applicable laws or with the educational mission, operations,
discipline or general welfare of the schools.
Definitions
