Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs,
my
name
is
Julia
Lester .
I
am
the
President-Elect
of
the
Maine
T ransgender
Network,
and
I
am
here
today
on
behalf
of
MaineT ransNet,
(GLAD),
EqualityMaine,
Portland
Outright,
Out
Maine,
and
the
Maine
Chapter
of
the
American
Academy
of

to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
515:
"An
Act
to
Require
School
Board
Approval
of
Superintendent
Rules
and
Administrative
Procedures.”
Our
work
as
LGBTQ+
organizations
includes
supporting
LGBTQ+
and
all
students,
regardless
of
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity ,
and
regardless
of
identifying
personal
characteristics,
in
Maine’ s
public
schools,
and
working
with
schools
and
school
districts
to
provide
equal
educational
opportunity
by
ensuring
their
learning
environments
are
safe,
welcoming,
and
inclusive
places
for
all
students
to
learn.
The
roles
of
the
school
board
and
superintendent
are
complementary
but
distinct.
The
board’ s
role
is
legislative.
They
are
responsible
for
the
governance
of
the
school
unit
through
the
decisions
they
make
and
policies
they
adopt
and
which
are
publicly
available
on
the
school’ s
or
district’ s
website.
The
Superintendent
serves
as
educational
leader
and
the
school
unit’ s
chief
administrator .
They
implement
the
policies
enacted
by
the
Board
and
administer
and
manage
various
operations
of
the
schools
in
compliance
with
board
policies
and
applicable
laws
and
regulations.
That
distinction,
put
succinctly:
the
School
Board’ s
responsibility
is
not
to
operate
the
schools
but
to
see
that
they
are
well
operated.

In
recent
months,
a
coordinated,
national
campaign
to
disrupt
the
education
of
transgender
students
(and
LGBTQ+
students
more
broadly)
and
to
disrupt
public
schools
generally
has
come
to
Maine.
School
boards
are
a
focus
of
those
ef forts.
Despite
the
ef forts
to
generate
fear
and
misunderstanding
of
what
happens
in
schools,
school
administrators
are
legally
obligated
to
ensure
the
safety ,
well-being,
and
education
of
all
students.
In
doing
so,
they
take
into
account
their
partnership
with
parents
to
support
students’
education,
as
well
as
the
students’
legal
rights
and
their
own
obligation
to
manage
the
school
learning
environment
and
operations.
The
Superintendent’ s
ability
to
implement
procedures
in
accord
with
the
school
board
is
part
of
sound
managerial
practices
and
ef ficiency .
There
is
no
need
to
force
reconsideration
of
every
procedure
implemented
by
a
Superintendent
who
is
the
professional
hired
to
ef fectuate
board
policies.
Parents
and
community
members
have
opportunities
to
weigh
in
on
policies
but
it
is
not
their
job
to
manage
the
school.
In
short,
this
proposal
simply
ties
up
school
of ficials’
time
with
rehashing
the
same
issues
rather
than
staying
focused
on
student
needs
and
education.
In
accord
with
the
law ,
school
districts
across
Maine
have
approved
policies
for
addressing
the
needs
of
transgender
students,
among
many
other
things.
Superintendents,
administrators,
teachers,
and
other
staf f
adhere
to
those
policies.
This
bill
would
create
a
second
bite
at
the
apple,
so
to
speak,
or
even
a
perpetual
biting
of
the
apple
because
some
people
do
not
agree
that
transgender
students
(or
LGBTQ+
students)
should
be
respected
as
they
are
while
at
school.
Stated
another
way ,
this
bill
is
a
tool
to
keep
school
policies
from
going
into
ef fect
and
to
ef fectively
erode
one
of
the
few
administrative
protections
transgender
(and
LGBTQ+)
students
have.
W e
implore
you
to
vote
ought
not
to
pass
on
this
bill.
The
safety
of
Maine
students
depends
on
it.
Thank
you,
Julia
Lester
