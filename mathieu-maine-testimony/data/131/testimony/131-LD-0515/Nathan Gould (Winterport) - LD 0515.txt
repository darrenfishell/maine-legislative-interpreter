Testimony in Support of LD 515
An Act to Require School Board Approval of Superintendent Rules and Administrative Procedures 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs:
My name is Nathan Gould. I am writing this testimony in support of LD 515, “An Act to Require 
School Board Approval of Superintendent Rules and Administrative Procedures.”
Parents must be able to place their trust in school administration. For many, this trust has 
lately been strained. It is fitting for changes in policy to require the approval of school board members,
elected to represent their constituents’ interests. It is the same for Town Councils and Town Managers,
Legislators and the Executive Branch: good government necessitates checks and balances. For the sake
of transparency and parental involvement, parents must be kept adequately informed as to any 
changes in administrative procedures or rules. They must be able to trust the institutions to which 
they send their children, and LD 515 is a step in that direction.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
