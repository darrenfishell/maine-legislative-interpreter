Testimony of Janelle D. Tirrell, DVM, in favor of LD 688 
March 23, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and honorable members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, my name is Janelle 
Tirrell and I am a resident of Palermo. I speak to you today as a member 
of the Maine Veterinary Medical Association, and as a practicing equine 
veterinarian in mid Maine. 
The MVMA is here today in support of LD 688. Geographic non- 
compete clauses have long been standard in veterinary employment 
contracts. From an employer ’s perspective, preventing an employee from 
leaving a practice and either working in a competing practice or starting 
a new one, seems an obvious advantage. The actual effect, however, is to 
either bind a doctor to a practice that may not be the best fit, or drive 
that doctor out of the area or out of the state. This is further 
complicated by the recent proliferation of corporate veterinary entities 
purchasing more than one clinic in an area, and thereby controlling the 
pet owning public’s access to preferred providers by preventing 
competition. 
I chose to move to Maine to practice right out of vet school. BeforeI 
opened my own practice, I worked for a veterinarian With 40 years of 
experience caring for the horses of Maine. My contract contained no 
geographic non-compete. I remember him telling me that if I came to 
Work for him and then was able to take all his clients, that the fault 
would lie with him. I was able to stay in Maine and start my business. 
He continued to practice. The clients were able to choose, and in the 
long run, animal health was served. 
I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 688. Thank you for your 
time.
