To
Senator
Tipping,
Representative
Roeder
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing:
My
name
is
Amanda
Bisol,
and
I
have
been
living
and
working
as
a
small
animal
veterinarian
in
Skowhegan
since
2011.
I
am
testifying
to
encourage
strong
support
for
LD
688,
An
Act
To
Protect
Access
To
Veterinary
Care
By
Prohibiting
Noncompete
Agreements.
I
want
to
start
by
saying
I
do
not
have
any
personal
conflicts
with
this
bill
as
I
have
no
intentions
of
moving
from
where
I
live
and
work
currently.
In
fact,
the
bill
could
pose
the
opposite
issue
for
me
by
making
it
easier
for
my
coworkers
to
change
jobs.
However,
as
many
of
you
may
know
if
you
have
tried
to
seek
veterinary
care,
the
state
of
veterinary
medicine
is
in
crisis.
The
pandemic
amplified
issues
that
were
already
a
problem.
At
my
clinic,
it
may
take
2
to
3
months
to
get
an
appointment.
We
cannot
take
same
day
non-client
emergencies
because
we
are
too
full
with
client
emergencies
in
addition
to
seeing
routine
visits.
This
means
people
in
our
geographic
area
that
have
not
been
to
our
clinic
before
may
need
to
drive
anywhere
from
1.5
to
3
hours
to
receive
same
day
emergency
care.
How
does
this
relate
to
this
bill?
Anything
that
we
can
do
as
a
state
to
help
make
it
easier
for
veterinarians
to
maintain
working
in
the
veterinary
profession
is
a
great
help.
A
specific
workplace
may
not
always
be
the
best
fit
for
an
individual,
and
having
the
ability
to
be
more
mobile
and
provide
coverage
elsewhere
or
to
change
jobs
is
vital.
Non-compete
clauses
are
restrictive
covenants
in
employment
contracts
that
prevent,
typically
a
professional,
from
working
within
a
certain
geographic
radius
from
the
original
place
of
employment
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
Historically,
these
likely
were
important
for
the
veterinary
employer
as
veterinary
care
was
much
more
competitive
and
looked
very
different
even
thirty
years
ago.
For
example,
the
non-compete
in
my
original
contract
12
years
ago
was
for
a
20
mile
radius
and
5
years
should
I
leave
the
practice.
I
still
have
one,
but
as
I
was
an
owner
this
bill
would
not
apply
to
me.
The
veterinary
workforce
has
changed
and
many
veterinarians
are
employee
associates
of
larger
for-profit
corporations.
They
now
need
the
same
protections
as
employees
making
less
than
400%
of
the
Federal
Poverty
Level
which
are
currently
protected
in
statute
in
Maine.
Adding
veterinarians
includes
having
more
options
with
mobility
in
a
job.
Veterinarians
are
not
automatically
on
a
partner
or
ownership
track
as
we
see
with
many
in
the
legal
and
human
medical
realms.
Many
veterinarians
continue
to
be
employees
and
not
business
owners
for
their
entire
careers.
Please
note
that
this
bill
continues
to
protect
business
owners
from
a
partner
leaving
and
opening
a
competitive
location.
This
change
is
not
a
new
concept,
other
states
have
enacted
similar
employee
protections:
●
California

workers-noncompete-agreements-are#:~:text=Attorney%20General%20Bonta%20remin
ds%20both,agreement%20to%20know%20their%20rights
●
Colorado
-
https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2022a_1317_signed.pdf
The
Federal
Trade
Commission
is
also
likely
going
to
pass
a
ruling
(here
is
a
good
article
summarizing
the
issue:
https://abcnews.go.com/US/ftcs-new-rule-end-noncompete-agreements-millions-workers/story?i
d=97684108
)
that
would
ban
them.
However,
this
likely
would
only
apply
to
inter-state
commerce
and
so
many
veterinarians
in
Maine
would
not
be
protected.
Based
on
this
summary,
I
strongly
recommend
enhancing
Maine’s
non-compete
statute
to
include
veterinarians.
We
are
honored
to
have
a
member
of
the
legislature
in
Representative
Fay
who
has
recognized
the
issues
facing
the
veterinary
profession
in
Maine
and
how
deeply
that
impacts
all
citizens
of
Maine
and
those
who
own
animals
-
whether
they
are
farm
animals
or
pets.
Last
year,
a
bill
was
passed
to
enhance
the
loan
repayment
program
from
the
state
(
https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/display_ps.asp?LD=1885&snum=130
).
This
year,
we
hope
to
include
veterinarians
in
disallowing
non-compete
restrictive
covenants
in
employment
contracts.
As
veterinarians
working
in
this
state
and
facing
grave
challenges
daily,
we
will
continue
to
work
to
make
sure
the
profession
is
improving
and
that
we
can
try
to
find
ways
to
address
the
challenges
of
access
to
veterinary
care
within
the
state
of
Maine.
Thank
you
for
supporting
the
veterinary
profession
and
animal
health.
Please
feel
free
to
reach
out
to
ask
me
any
questions
you
may
have
about
this
issue
or
other
issues
facing
the
veterinary
profession
in
the
state.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
Sincerely,
Amanda
Bisol,
