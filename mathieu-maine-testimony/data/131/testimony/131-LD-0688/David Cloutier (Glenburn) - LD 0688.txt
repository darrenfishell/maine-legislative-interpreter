Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and distinguished member of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing, I am David Cloutier a resident of Glenburn and an owner at Veazie Veterinary Clinic 
where I have practiced since 1992. 
I offer this testimony in support of LD 688, An Act to Protect Access to Veterinary Care by Prohibiting 
Noncompete Agreements.
I have been on all sides of the non-compete issue. I have purchased and sold veterinary practices. I have 
been an employee and employer. I have been encumbered by non-competes and encumbered others. It 
is my opinion and experience that the only place a non-compete is necessary and appropriate is the 
business transaction of the purchase and sale of a practice or a part of a practice when a consideration 
has been paid for the covenant not to compete. 
In a typical employment agreement, where no consideration is paid for a covenant not to compete, 
there should not be a non-compete clause. It is appropriate to incumber a departing employee from 
soliciting former clients. However, a non-compete clause that inhibits veterinarians from 
finding employment in the community they reside in is never appropriate. This leaves them the choice 
to leave the community, commute or remain unemployed. In the current climate of a shortage of 
veterinary care it does not make sense for non-competes to further incumber veterinarians from 
working. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony.  I urge you to support this proposal.
