Joint Standing Committee on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
Testimony in Support of L.D. 1023, An Act to Strengthen Maine's Financial Future in Perpetuity by 
Establishing the Irrevocable Budget Trust Fund 
Honorable Chairs and Members: 
OST is supportive of the intent of L.D. 1023. After speaking with Rep. Perry, we understand he wishes to 
gauge interest on part of the Committee in continuing work on this proposal. Not every agency or 
department is always eager to participate in working groups or both formal and informal studies of issues 
raised by bill proposals. OST is no exception. In this case however, we see the potential positive impact 
of a structure and policies contemplated in L.D. 1023 as deserving of our support and effort. 
Therefore, to the extent the Committee wishes to proceed in discussions or further development of this 
L.D., OST stands ready to assist. Topics related to the permanent fund-like entity needing more 
exploration include: 
1. Funding sources-many states have some form of the entity proposed in L.D. 1023, but it seems all 
of those states utilize non-general revenue streams often tied to certain assets or industries within 
a state. 
2. Governance of the entity. 
3. What discretion if any to set investment policy, funding and contribution amounts is granted to the 
entity. 
4. Resources needed for governing and operating the entity. 
5. How the proposed entity will be judged by credit rating agencies.
