SUBJECT:  Testimony on L.D. 1023  – An Act to Strengthen Maine’s Financial Future in 
Perpetuity by Establishing the Irrevocable Budget Trust Fund  
 
MainePERS is submitting written testimony neither for nor against L.D. 1023 , specifically  
relating to  proposed 5 M.R.S. § 1524, sub -§4, which contains the only language in the bill  that 
pertains to MainePERS.  
 
MainePERS administers defined benefit plans  and holds funds in trust for the beneficiari es of 
those plans.  MainePERS also administers a group life insurance program and holds funds in 
trust for the participants in that program.  The Board also serves as trustees of the investment 
trust fund for the Irrevocable Trust Fund for Post -employment benefits for retiree health 
benefits for State employees and teachers.   MainePERS does not hold nor invest funds for any 
other purposes.  
 
LD. 1023 establishes an Irrevocable Budget Trust Fund.  It appears to assign MainePERS a role 
in investing budget trus t funds similar to our role with the aforementioned trust funds.  We 
are concerned that this role strays from our core mission of providing retirement and related 
benefits  to public employees .  The post -employment trust funds for which the Board serves as 
trustees have some relation to our mission since they provide health insurance for our retirees.  
L.D. 1023 would appear to be drawing MainePERS into general investment manage men t for 
the State, a role that may be more appropriate for the State Treasurer .   
 
Thank you for your consideration of this testimony.  We are available to attend your work 
session  if you have questions .
