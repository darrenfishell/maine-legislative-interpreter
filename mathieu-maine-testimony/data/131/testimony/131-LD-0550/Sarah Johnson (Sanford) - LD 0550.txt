Testimony of Sarah Johnson
 IN SUPPORT OF LD 550 
An Act to Increase Correctional Officer Salary and Benefits
Representatives Lanigan, Cyrway, Fredericks, Woodsome, Senators Harrington, 
Hickman and Honorable Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee,
My name is Sarah Johnson.  I am a Software Support Specialist and I live in Sanford. 
I am a former volunteer instructor in the Maine Correctional System (17 years) and  I 
recently worked in the education department at the Western New Mexico Correctional
Facility in Grants, NM for 4 years. 
I am writing in support of LD 1863 which is critical to aiding efforts to recruit and 
retain correctional officers. There is a nationwide crisis in correctional staffing which 
has so many negative ramifications. The safety and security of all staff and residents 
is of course of highest importance. Adequate and experienced staff who are 
recognized and appreciated also contribute to successful programming, rehabilitation 
and reentry into our communities. 
Please consider the overall benefits to more competitive compensation for 
correctional officers.
Thank you
Sarah Johnson
