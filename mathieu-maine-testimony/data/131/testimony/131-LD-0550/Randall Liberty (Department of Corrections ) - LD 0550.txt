TESTIMONY OF  
 
RANDALL A. LIBERTY, COMMISSIONER  
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  
 
NFNA  
 
LD 550 An Act to Increase Correctional Officer Salary and Benefits  
 
Before the  
Criminal Justice Public Safety Committee  
May 9, 2023  
 
 
Senator Beebe -Center and Representative Salisbury and other distinguished members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, I am Randall Liberty, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections 
providing testimony NFNA  to LD 550. 
 
The Depart ment has yet to see any language related to this bill  nor have we been asked to be involved in any 
conversations related to the intent of the bill . With no information, we  are unable  to provide a position.  
 
We look forward to hearing more about the intent  of the bill, and since the title suggests it will have a  direct 
impact  on the MDOC, we hope to work with the sponsor.  
 
That said, the Department  believes generally that matter s related to labor negotiations  are best served at the 
bargaining table.  
 
Thank You,  
 
 
 
Randall A. Liberty, Commissioner  
Maine Department of Corrections
