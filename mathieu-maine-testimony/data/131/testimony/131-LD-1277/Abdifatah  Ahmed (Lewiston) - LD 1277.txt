I am for the proposed legislation because for 10 years ago I tried to buy home for my 
family and I want to my local bank and I told them that I can not take interest due to 
my religious believes. They told me that to fill out all the forms for the house and they
told me that I have an excellent credit but they can not offer me no interest loan or  
they can not work with me for other options either. 
So, I could not buy the house because of that.
