Re:
L.D.

An
Act
to
Amend
the
Laws
Regarding
Property
Investment
by 
Credit
Unions
Dear
Sen.
Bailey,
Rep.
Perry
and
members
of
the
Health
Coverage,
Insurance
and
Financial 
Services
Committee:
As
the
mayor
of
Lewiston,
I
would
like
to
voice
my
support
for
this
bill.
This
legislation
will 
help
my
city
and
many
others
in
the
state
to
be
more
economically
prosperous
and 
welcoming
communities.
By
enabling
credit
unions
to
have
alternative
mortgage 
products,
it
will
allow
more
people
to
own
houses
which
will
beneﬁt
our
whole
city.
Please
support
this
pathway
to
home
ownership
which
helps
ensure
everyone
in
Maine 
can
purchase
a
house.
I
appreciate
Senator
Margaret
Rotundo
for
sponsoring
this
bill
and
the
committee’s
time.
Sincerely,
Carl
L.
Sheline
