Testimony in support of: 
LD 988 "Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 
Conduct an Accessibility Study of All Maine State Parks and Historic Sites and to Develop 
a Plan to Remove Access Barriers"
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, 
My name is Stephanie Pelletier and I live in Fort Kent. I am a self-advocate and I think this bill 
should pass. 
At state parks many of the bathrooms need to be made accessible for wheelchairs and walkers. 
There should also be ramps to get down to beach areas if the park has one. I also think there 
should be handles for people who need to hold on to walk. 
I would ask the committee to pass LD 988. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely,
Stephanie Pelletier
