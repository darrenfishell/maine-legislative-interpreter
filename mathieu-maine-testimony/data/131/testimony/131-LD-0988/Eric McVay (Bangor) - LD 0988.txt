Testimony in support of: 
LD 988 "Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 
Conduct an Accessibility Study of All Maine State Parks and Historic Sites and to Develop 
a Plan to Remove Access Barriers"
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, 
My name is Eric McVay. I live in Bangor and I am a self-advocate. I am here today in support of 
LD 988. I support this bill because I think it is a great idea to have a feasibility study about 
accessibility at state parks. 
My support staff has a friend who has been working to make trails more accessible for people 
with disabilities to use. He has done a lot of mapping and other work. And I think it makes sense 
that state parks and other historic sites should also be made accessible. I think that people with 
disabilities should be able to use these parks too and we need to make it accessible for them. 
I would urge an ought to pass on this bill. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Eric McVay
