Testimony in support of: 
LD 988 "Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 
Conduct an Accessibility Study of All Maine State Parks and Historic Sites and to Develop 
a Plan to Remove Access Barriers"
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, 
Thank you for allowing me the chance to speak today. My name is Jon McGovern and I live in 
Bangor Maine. I am a self-advocate and I also work for Speaking Up For Us which is Maine’s 
Self-advocacy Network. I am here today to in favor of LD 988.  
This bill is important to me because I think that the trails should be easier and wider for people 
who have wheelchairs or canes.  I’d like to see State parks be accessible in the wintertime for 
people other than snowmobiles. I’d like to see easy-to-read signs so that people can navigate the 
trails easily.  I’d like to see more areas for water activities to be accessible.  I’d like to see 
professionals available to help people with disabilities understand the landscape, history, and 
accessible areas of the parks.  
I’d like to see more educational programs for learning about the nature that surrounds the park.  
I’d like to see a digital or paper map available of accessible features at each state part for 
vacation or recreation planning.  I’d like to see prior to attending the park if there are barriers or 
unsafe features that may challenge me, my friend, or my family. Understanding the 
complications that may arise prior to my park visit will be helpful.
Thank you for your time and I think you should pass LD 988. 
Sincerely,
Jon McGovern
