Testimony in support of: 
LD 988 "Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 
Conduct an Accessibility Study of All Maine State Parks and Historic Sites and to Develop 
a Plan to Remove Access Barriers"
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, 
My name is Nicole and I live in Presque Isle. I am a self-advocate I want you to know that I 
support LD 988.  
This bill is important to me because we need more accessible hiking trails because right now a 
lot of people with disabilities cannot access hiking trails and state parks, therefore, hindering 
their outside activity and missing out on healthy fitness options.  Because of the lack of 
accessibility, we are missing out on important opportunities to enjoy nature and have a similar 
experience to our non-disabled peers.  Improving healthy opportunities increases our physical 
and mental health.
I would ask the committee to pass LD 988. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely,
Nicole (Jozie) Easler
