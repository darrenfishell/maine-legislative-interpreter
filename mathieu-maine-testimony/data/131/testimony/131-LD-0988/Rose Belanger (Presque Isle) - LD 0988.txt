Testimony in support of: 
LD 988 "Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 
Conduct an Accessibility Study of All Maine State Parks and Historic Sites and to Develop 
a Plan to Remove Access Barriers"
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, 
My name is Rose Belanger and I live in Presque Isle. I am a self-advocate I want you to know 
that I support LD 988.  
This bill is important to me because I have fellow members of my community with different 
disabilities that are not able to experience the beautiful natural scenery or fresh air that those with 
less severe disabilities would enjoy. Without the changes to hiking trails and other historical 
landmarks, they are missing out on beautiful and enriching places.  This bill is important to make 
state parks available for anyone to be able to hike, swim, enjoy nature and as much of an 
opportunity to have fun as everyone else.
I would ask the committee to pass LD 988. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely,
Rose Belanger
