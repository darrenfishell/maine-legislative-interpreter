My
name
is
Jessica
Russell
and
I
am
writing
in
support
of
LD
988
(Resolve,
Directing
the
Department
of
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry
to
Conduct
an
Accessibility
Study
of
All
Maine
State
Parks
and
Historic
Sites
and
to
Develop
a
Plan
to
Remove
Access
Barriers).
I
joined
the
disability
community
fast
and
furious
at
the
age
of
eighteen
by
being
rendered
a
quadriplegic
instantly
as
a
passenger
in
a
car
accident.
Up
to
that
point,
I
was
very
active,
participated
in
sports
and
physical
activities,
and
I
was
even
on
my
college
soccer
team
at
the
time
of
my
injury.
I
enjoyed
being
active
and
being
outdoors
–
and
that
has
never
changed.
What
did
change
was
the
access
I
am
granted
to
continue
to
enjoy
these
same
activities
that
I
did
when
I
was
able-bodied.
Once
you
live
life
on
wheels,
most
of
the
world
around
you
becomes
an
obstacle.
This
doesn’t
need
to
be
the
case.
We,
as
humans,
are
always
evolving
and
problem
solving.
We
can
easily
make
our
world
more
accessible
for
all,
not
only
the
disabled.
Accessible
and
universal
design
benefits
our
aging
population,
children
and
their
caretakers,
and
people
who
are
recovering
from
temporary
injuries.
We
have
all
been
and
hopefully
will
live
long
enough
to
be
a
part
of
every
population
that
benefits
from
intentional
accessible
design.
Our
beautiful
state
of
Maine
has
48
state
parks
and
historic
sites.
From
my
understanding,
a
new
initiative
has
been
launched
to
rebuild
these
parks.
Why
not
allocate
these
funds
to
improving
our
great
Maine
outdoors
for
ALL
residents?
Give
us
spaces
where
anyone
at
any
age
and
in
any
condition
can
have
a
reprieve
from
their
day
to
day
life.
Think
about
how
you
feel
after
a
walk
through
the
woods
or
the
way
ocean
air
just
hits
different.
We
all
want
that
and
that
is
why
we
all
live
in
Maine.
As
a
wheelchair
user,
beach
access
is
at
the
very
top
of
my
wish
list.
I
want
every
state
park
beach
to
be
equipped
with
beach
mats,
boardwalks,
or
any
path
that
allows
access
in
an
everyday
wheelchair
AND
floating
beach
wheelchairs.
The
best
beach
wheelchairs
out
there
are
MobiChair
Floating
Beach
Wheelchairs
which
are
comfortable
for
the
user,
can
roll
on
sand,
and
can
float
in
water.
I
make
a
point
each
summer
to
visit
Wells
Beach
with
my
family
where
these
chairs
are
free
to
rent.
Unfortunately,
they
are
in
such
high
demand
on
a
first
come
first
serve
basis
that
you
have
to
arrive
very
early
in
the
morning
to
secure
them,
and
sometimes
that
is
not
even
enough.
One
of
my
best
memories
with
my
son
was
a
full
day
at
the
beach
when
he
was
six
years
old.
He
thought
it
was
SO
COOL
for
me
to
actually
be
in
the
water
with
him.
I
cried
tears
of
joy
(inconspicuously
thanks
to
the
salt
water)
and
I
always
treasure
that
one
day
where
I
felt
free
in
the
ocean
with
my
family.
From
what
I
see
(utilizing
the
state’s
web
search
capabilities)
there
are
thirteen
state
parks
with
beach
access.
Can
we
provide
each
of
these
with
at
least
one
floating
beach
wheelchair
(if
not
more)?
I
know
Crescent
Beach
in
Cape
Elizabeth
does
offer
access
to
one,
but
let’s
make
the
same
access
a
statewide
offering
by
covering
the
other
parks
with
beaches
in
Edmunds
Township,
New
Harbor,
Farmington,
South
Harpswell,
Saco,
Phippsburg,
Falmouth,
Camden,
Lubec,
Georgetown,
and
Scarborough.
Second
on
my
wish
list
is
that
more
trails
are
made
accessible.
I
know
of
a
handful
of
trails
in
my
vicinity
that
I
can
navigate
in
my
chair
and
I
appreciate
each
and
every
one
of
those.
There
is
an
effort
locally
in
my
area
(Portland)
and
around
the
state
to
provide
more
trail
access
for
wheelchairs.
I
am
so
thankful
that
each
year
there
seems
to
be
a
few
more
trails
that
I
can
try
out.
The
opportunity
to
get
in
some
solid
activity
(20
to
30
minutes
of
exercise)
outdoors
is
invaluable
for
mental
health
and
longevity.
In
conclusion,
please
consider
that
removing
barriers
within
our
state
parks
falls
well
within
this
funding
and
benefits
every
single
Mainer
of
every
age
and
ability,
but
also
dis
ability.
