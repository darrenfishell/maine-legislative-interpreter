LD 988
Dear Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and Members of the Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry,
I am writing to express my strong support for the bill LD 988 titled 
"Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to Conduct an 
Accessibility Study of All Maine State Parks and Historic Sites and to Develop a Plan to 
Remove Access Barriers."
As a person with a disability who uses a wheelchair, I know firsthand the challenges 
that arise when trying to access outdoor recreational spaces.   Often there is not a flat 
pathway to picnic areas and sites of interest.  Picnic tables often have benches on both
sides. I am not able to pull up to the table with my wheelchair.  The trails leading to 
scenic destinations are often too uneven and bumpy to use with a wheelchair.  This is 
very limiting for me, and frustrating when trying to plan an outing with family 
members.  One trail leading to a scenic view in some parks would be such a big 
improvement and give people with limited mobility an opportunity to enjoy the 
outdoors with their families.
I believe that universal design works for everyone and that by making Maine's state 
parks more accessible, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to experience 
the natural beauty of our state.  This bill would be an important step in that direction 
by directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to conduct an 
accessibility study of Maine's state parks and historic sites and develop a plan to 
remove access barriers.
I urge you to support this bill and help make Maine's state parks and historic sites 
accessible to all.  Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Sarah Trites
