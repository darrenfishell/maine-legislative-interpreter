Testimony in support of: 
LD 988 "Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 
Conduct an Accessibility Study of All Maine State Parks and Historic Sites and to Develop 
a Plan to Remove Access Barriers"
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, 
My name is Robbie Garland and I live in Danforth. I am a self-advocate I want you to know that 
I support LD 988.  The bill is important to me because I have lived experience with this issue 
concerning park accessibility. 
I have tried to communicate with the town office, and they pointed me to the superintendent of 
the Rec Center, I was told that the issue would be discussed at the council meeting and would get 
to back me, however, they did not.  I enjoy parks for my recreation as do the others in my 
program frequently. This Bill is important because I would like to see that the animals, such as 
service animals, that are getting exercise have an area to get a drink. I think it is important to 
have safe trails to walk so more natural wildlife can be enjoyed. 
I would ask the committee to pass LD 988. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely,
Robbie Garland
