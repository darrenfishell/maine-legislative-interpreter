Dear Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and Members of the Committee on 
Agriculture, Conversation and Forestry,
I am writing to express my strong support for the bill titled "Resolve, Directing the Department 
of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to Conduct an Accessibility Study of All Maine State 
Parks and Historic Sites and to Develop a Plan to Remove Access Barriers." 
As a person with a disability who uses a wheelchair, I know firsthand the challenges that can 
arise when trying to access outdoor recreational spaces.
Living in Sabattus, Maine, I have always enjoyed spending time outdoors with my family. 
However, I have often found access to certain areas of Maine's state parks difficult or limited 
due to physical barriers that make it difficult or impossible for me to navigate. 
I believe that universal design works for everyone, and that by making Maine's state parks more 
accessible, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to experience the natural beauty 
of our state. This bill would be an important step in that direction by directing the Department 
of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to conduct an accessibility study of all Maine State 
Parks and Historic Sites and develop a plan to remove access barriers.
I urge you to support this bill and help make Maine's state parks and historic sites accessible to 
all. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Sarah Trite
