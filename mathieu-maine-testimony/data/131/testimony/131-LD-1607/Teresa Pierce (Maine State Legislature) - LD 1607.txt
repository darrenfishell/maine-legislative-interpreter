Testimony of Senator Teresa S. Pierce introducing 
LD 1607, An Act to Stabilize the Pension Funds of the Maine Public 
Employees Retirement System 
before the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
April 24, 2023 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs, and honorable members of the Appropriations 
and Financial Affairs Committee, my name is Teresa Pierce, and I represent Senate 
District 25, which includes Falmouth, Cumberland, North Yarmouth, Yarmouth 
(majority), Gray, and Long Island. Today, I am pleased to introduce LD 1607, An Act to 
Stabilize the Pension Funds of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System. 
As legislators, we have heard from retired teachers and state workers about their 
struggles making ends meet on a MainePERS pension. Many of the struggles were 
caused by the deep cuts to the beneﬁts in 2011. In the 130th, we recognized and worked 
on the State and Teacher retirement system and were able to make good progress, but as 
you know, our constitutional restraints requiring us to have the funds upfront in order to 
make any adjustments - this makes it very difﬁcult to make advances because most, if not 
all solutions, are met with huge ﬁscal notes. LD 1607 is an attempt to bring long-term 
planning to the problem. The bill proposes creating the Retirement Improvement Fund as 
an interest-bearing, non-lapsing account dedicated speciﬁcally to create a “saving 
account” to help pay for pension improvements in the future. 
This legislation is important to pass now because the ﬁnal payoff of the legacy Unﬁinded 
Actuarial Liability (UAL) is fast approaching. Per the Maine State Constitution, the debt 
accrued by Legislatures prior to 1996 attributable to the MainePERS pension system 
must be paid off by 2028. Once fully paid, the state will be relieved of hundreds of 
millions of dollars in pension obligations payments every biennium. This proposal 
speciﬁcally proposes to set aside the difference in the UAL payments from the previous 
year — meaning when UAL payments decline, that funding is set aside in the Retirement 
Improvement Fund to help pay for pension improvements now and into the future. 
LD 1607 proposes to use the funds set aside in the Retirement Improvement Fund for the 
sole purpose of increasing the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for retirees. Currently, 
the cost-of-living adjustment only applies to the ﬁrst $24,186.25 of earnings. This bill 
could establish funding to help lift the cap even higher so more retirees receive a cost-of- 
living adjustment on more of their pension beneﬁt. LD 1607 would earmark the money

that the state will be saving once the debt is paid, and dedicate it to an improvement fund 
so that money can be used to pay for pension improvements. 
I still ﬁrmly believe We must provide relief to retirees in the current budget process much 
like We did last session when We were able to lift the cumulative COLA and increase the 
COLA cap by the full inﬂationary amount of 5.4%. But this bill will allow us to start 
planning ahead so we can make signiﬁcant progress in the future instead of kicking the 
can further down the road. 
Thank you for allowing me to introduce this important legislation before you today, andI 
am happy to answer any questions.
