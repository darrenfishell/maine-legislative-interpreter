SUBJECT:  Testimony on L.D. 1607  – An Act to Stabilize the Pension Funds of the Maine 
Public Employees Retirement System  
 
MainePERS is submitting written testimony neither for nor against L.D. 1607 . 
 
LD. 1607 would establish  the Retirement Improvement Fund  for the payment of retirement 
benefit improvements , and sets out how resources would be transferred to the fund .  The fund 
as described in the bill  appears consistent with other  fund s that a re held and administered by 
the State of Maine , specifically as an “interest -bearing, nonlapsing fund .”  The bill would 
establish the new fund by adding  a new Article 10 to Part 20 of Title 5.  However, t here is 
existing language in Title 5, sections 17103 and 17153 , that make s the MainePERS Board of 
Trustees responsible for funds established by Part 20.    We recommend amending the bill to 
clarify that the Board is not responsible for the new fund  or alternatively to move the 
provisions establishing the new fund outside of Part 20 .  An example of how to make this 
clarification is in Title 5, section 17433.  
 
Thank you for your consideration of this testimony.  We are available to attend your work 
session  if you have questions .
