Testimony  
In Support  
LD 1607: An Act to Stabilize the Pension Funds of the Maine Public Employees Retirement 
System   
John Kosinski, Government Relations Director, Maine Education Association  
Before the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee  
April  24, 2023  
 
Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and other esteemed members of the Appropriations and 
Financial Affairs Committee,  
 
My name is John Kosinski (he/him)  and I am proud to serve as the Director of Government Relations for 
the Maine Education Association (MEA).  The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, 
including teachers and other professionals in nearly every public school in the state an d faculty and other 
professional staff in the University of Maine and Community College Systems.  
 
I submit this testimony on behalf of the MEA in support  of LD 1607, An Act to Stabilize the Pension 
Funds of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System.   
 
As you have heard this session and legislators have heard in the previous 5 legislative sessions, the 
pension benefits for teachers, ed techs and state employees continue to erode.  The deep cuts to the 
pension passed in 2011 and now high inflation have c aused a diminishing in pension benefits in terms of 
purchasing power for all current retirees and for all active employees whenever they retire.  Maine’s 
unique constitutional constraints require the state to pay the full cost, up -front for an increase in benefits 
for current retirees and the state must pay the entire cost, up -front on the impact of future benefits even 
for those who may retire decades from now.  Taken together, the 2011 cuts, inflation and the 
constitutional amendment create a perfect stor m for teachers and ed techs and state employees.  Benefits 
continue to erode.  Retirees are feeling more financially insecure as prices rise.  Yet the cost of 
improvements is expensive, and the state has struggled to fully fix this problem.   
 
Last session , the Legislature recognized the challenges, and their efforts were heroic, but the fixes did 
not entirely keep pace with inflation.  Inflation was 5.4% yet the maximum cost -of-living in MainePERS 
is 3%.  (However, this 3% cost -of-living adjustment (COLA) is a bit misleading since it only applies to 
roughly the first $24,000 in pension benefits. )  For many, this results in the COLA more accurately 
being at 1.6% or lower .  But last session the Legislature lifted the COLA from 3% to 4% and lifted the 
base amo unt the COLA applies to by the full inflationary amount.  The cost was over $100 million to 
make these changes.  While we are extremely grateful, benefits still lost 1.4% compared to inflation.  
What’s more, as you have already heard, for the current year retirees received the maximum 3% COLA 
(again misleading since it only applies to roughly the first $24,000 in benefits) yet inflation was 9.1%.

There is no relief in sight for the current year and without action pension benefits for everyone in the 
plan will erode by at least 6.1% compared to inflation  this year alone .  The full cost of keeping pace with 
inflation and lifting the COLA for the current year and the base amount for the COLA by 6.1% would 
cost the state more than  $550 million.   
 
Unfortuna tely, we expect current trends to continue.  Inflation in March of 2023 was 5%.  In February of 
2023 inflation was 6%.  While the downward trend continues, we could see inflation stabilize above the 
3% maximum COLA for at least the rest of this year and ev en beyond.  If this is true, we will have this 
same issue year after year, where the pension benefits for all current and future retirees continue to erode 
in terms of purchasing power.  
 
LD 1607 is an attempt to prepare for the future.  The same constituti onal amendment that created the 
prohibition on creating new “unfunded liabilities” also required the payoff  by 2028  of the unfunded 
actuarial liability or UAL for all debt accrued prior to 1996.  2028 is approaching.  Once this “legacy 
debt” is complete ly paid off in 2028, the state will see a major reduction in its pension payments.  This 
bill attempts to capture the savings the state will see as a result of this payoff, and store that money in a 
Retirement Improvement Fund for the sole purpose of making p ension improvements.   
 
In FY 23, the state’s required contribution for the Unfunded Actuarial Liability is $347,868,304.  This 
continues to rise over the next few years until it reaches $395,664,420 in FY 28.  However, for FY 29, 
the required state paymen t is expected to plummet to $117,026,950, saving the state an estimated $270 
million.   
 
This bill attempts to capture that difference in state contribution and dedicates it to the Retirement 
Improvement Fund.  The money squirreled away will be use d to lif t COLA cap put in place in 2011 .   
We would like to suggest an amendment to the bill before you.   
 
As written, the Retirement Improvement Fund will likely only capture funding in FY 29.  The bill 
currently reads that resources in the Fund should be “equal  to the difference between the amount of the 
payments made toward the obligation for the unfunded actuarial liability in the year in which the amount 
is transferred and the amount of those payments for the year preceding the year in which the amount is 
transferred.”  As I described above, the payoff of the “legacy UAL” will come in FY28, and therefore 
under this writing the Fund will only see funding dedicated to it in FY 29.  We suggest the Committee 
consider depositing the difference between the FY28 cont ribution to the UAL and expected payment in 
the current year and we continue this for at least 5 years.  Under this scenario, each year the state will 
compare its UAL payment to the FY 28 figure and deposit the difference into the Retirement 
Improvement Fu nd.   
 
I want to be clear.  LD 1607 will not help the retirees today struggling with rising prices and stagnant 
benefits.  There are retired teachers hurting today.  Some teachers may have retired from a low paying 
district 30 years ago – these are the ret irees I worry about the most.  Under our current pension structure,

the longer one lives, the worse the financial pain gets.  We sincerely hope the Legislature will find ways 
to make improvements in the next round of budget discussions.   
 
But LD 1607 will help us better prepare for the future.  It will set aside funding that can and should be 
dedicated to undoing some of the damage of the past decade.  And it does so by putting aside the 
“windfall” the state will see once the legacy UAL deb t has been fully paid off.   
 
For these reasons and more, we support LD 1607.  
 
Thank you for your time and your service to the people of Maine.  I will do my best to answer any 
questions you may have.
