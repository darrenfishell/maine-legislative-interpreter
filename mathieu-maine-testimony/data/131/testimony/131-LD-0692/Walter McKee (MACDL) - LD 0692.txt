RE: LD 692 --  An Act Regarding Eligibility of County Jail Inmates for a 
 Community Confinement Monitoring Program  
 
Dear Senator Beebe- Center , Representative  Salisbury, and Mem bers of the Crimin al 
Justice and Public  Safety Committee:  
 
MACDL opposes  LD 692. 
 
This bill places limits on what a  sheriff can do with r espect to allowing an inmate to 
partici pate in a community confinement monitoring program. As it stands now, the 
sheriff has the discretion to allow a whole host of inm ates to participate in these 
important programs that allow  for the transition of a n inmate from incarcerati on to 
being free again.  Sheriffs already  assess the risk of allowing an inmate to participate 
in a community confinement m onitoring program, and forcing the sheriff to ha ve to 
go through a  detailed, multi- part analysis , for each inmate,  is time -consuming, 
burdensome, and t akes away the power from the sheriff to make decisions as the 
sheriff sees fit.  
 
The Legislature should a llow our county sheriffs to address inmate issues like this on 
their own.  This  is especially so in the age of significant overcrowding of our county 
jails.  Placing more limits on what a sheriff can do and under what circumstances a 
sheriff can do it only serves to harm the reduction of the overcrowding problem, not 
help it.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to address this issue.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Walter F. McKee  
Chair, Legi slative Committee
