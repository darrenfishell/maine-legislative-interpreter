Dana Ward
Biddeford 
LD 692
To the Honorable Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and the honorable 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee. My name is Dana Ward, and I am writing in support of LD 692- “An Act 
Regarding Eligibility of County Jail Inmates for a Community Confinement 
Mentoring Program. This Bill, when enacted into law, would add further protections 
to survivors of domestic abuse, who have suffered at the hands of domestic abuser 
perpetrators. By requiring the jail administrator to help make the determination if the 
inmate is not likely to pose a risk to the safety of others in the community, it enables 
one who has had close contact with the perpetrator to make their recommendation, 
instead of someone on the outside of the jail who may have limited knowledge and 
experience with the perp. It also affords the added protection to survivors when the 
perps are given community confinement, by requiring that that be notified when the 
perp has left the jail and is in their community. Other states that have such programs 
require these relatively minimal requirements, and Maine should offer no less; as 
“State borders should not dictate who is protected and who is not!”. Thank you for 
your time and consideration of this important Bill.   Dana Ward, York County
