SHIRA BURNS, Exncurrvn DIRECTOR 
“An Act Regarding Eligibility of County Jail Inmates fora 
Community Conﬁnement Monitoring Program” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Public Hearing Date: April 10, 2023 
Testimony in Support of LD 692 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety. My name is Shira Burns and I represent the Maine Prosecutors 
Association. I am here to testify in support of LD 692. 
Being properly aware of risks associated with domestic violence offenders is essential for holding 
domestic violence offenders accountable and providing the best safety for the victim available. LD 
692 provides certain factors that jails need to consider when releasing a domestic violence offender 
through the community conﬁnement monitoring program. This is all practical and sensible 
information to have when making a decision about an offender ’s risk of release through the 
community conﬁnement monitoring program 
Victim notiﬁcation is an essential factor in victim safety. Victims are in the best position to 
understand the risks posed by their abuser. The Maine Prosecutors Association appreciates that not 
only will a good faith effort be made to contact the victim directly, but that the prosecutor and local 
domestic violence resource center will be notiﬁed of the oﬁ. °ender’s pending release to provide more 
of a collaborative approach in supporting the victim. 
For these reasons, the Maine Prosecutors Association supports LD 692.
