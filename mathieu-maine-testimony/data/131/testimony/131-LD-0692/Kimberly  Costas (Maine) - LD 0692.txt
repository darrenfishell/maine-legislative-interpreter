LD 692
I am writing in support of ld 692 . I am a domestic violence survivor.on oct 16 2021 I 
was strangled by my ex partner. I think there should be more monitor ing of 
offenders. Not only did I have to worry about recovery I also had to deal with not 
knowing where she is . She was let out of a nc jail with no forwarding info. I wasn't 
even told .it's already a scary stressful time but to have wonder where she may be 
made it worse.  Thank u for ur time and acknowledgeing this important issue.sincerly 
Kimberly Costas.
