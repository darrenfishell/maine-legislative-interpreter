Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
“free
market
think
tank,”
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LDs
182
183,
268,
364,
and
454
.
While
the
unemployment
rate
is
low,
the
workforce
participation
rate
is
dismal
compared
to
the
national
average
and
our
neighbors.

This
should
tell
us
that
now
is
the
time
to
review
what
incentives
may
be
keeping
Mainers
out
of
the
workforce,
or
working
just
enough
to
not
lose
social
assistance
benefits.
During
the
previous
administration,
DHHS
tightened
certain
welfare
programs
with
reforms
like
lifetime
limits
on
benefits
and
work
requirements,
and
saw
significant
benefits
to
the
labor
force
and
state
budget.

A
report
compiled
by
the
governor’s
Office
of
Policy
Management
and
state
economist
in
April
2016
tracked
employment
and
wage
records
for
nearly
7,000
able-bodied
adults
as
they
cycled
off
food
stamps.
After
the
first
year,
these
adults’
incomes
rose
114%
on
average—a
combined
$18
million—because
they
re-entered
the
workforce
and
broke
out
of
the
cycle
of
dependence
that
state
welfare
benefits
can
facilitate.

This
committee
has
an
opportunity
to
reaffirm
the
ultimate
goal
of
welfare
in
order
to
allow
more
Mainers
to
get
out
of
the
system
and
become
self-sufficient.
We
commend
Sen.
Brakey
for
submitting
these
pieces
of
common
sense
legislation.
These
bills
will
significantly
contribute
to
a
more
vibrant
workforce,
drive
higher
incomes
for
hard-working
Mainers,
and
protect
taxpayers
against
waste.
LD
182
would
limit
receipt
of
General
Assistance
within
a
period
of
5
years
for
any
able-bodied
individual
without
dependents
to
275
days
(about
9
months).
LD
183
would
specify
that
those
who
have
received
Temporary
Assistance
for
Needy
Families
(TANF)
benefits
for
60
months—the
current
lifetime
limit—would
be
ineligible
for
municipal
general
assistance,
unless
they
have
been
ineligible
for
TANF
for
five
years.
LD
454
would
require
applicants
for
municipal
general
assistance
be
a
resident
of
the
state
of
Maine
for
at
least
180
days.
Similarly,
LD
268
would
require
a
municipal
general
assistance
(GA)
beneficiary
to
have
been
a
resident
of
the
municipality
in
which
they
are
applying
for
benefits
for
at
least
45
days.
It
also
would
remove
the
requirement
that
a
municipality
provide
GA
to
someone
who
is
unhoused
who
applies
for
it,
and
it
would
remove
the
prohibition
on
municipalities
setting
their
own
durational
residency
requirement
to
receive
GA.
Current
law
provides
no
mechanism
for
municipalities
to
ensure
that
those
who
apply
for
GA
are
bona
fide
residents.
Today,
“resident”
in
section
4307
applies
to
any
“person
who
is
physically
present
in
a
municipality
with
the
intention
of
remaining
in
that
municipality.”
4
With
such
little
assurance
that
a
GA
beneficiary
is
even
a
resident
of
the
particular
municipality
in
which
they
are
applying,
administration
of
this
program
is
hardly
fair
to
those
who
actually
have
“intention
of
remaining.”
LD
364
would
ensure
that
general
assistance
beneficiaries
have
exhausted
every
other
available
resource
to
them
before
turning
to
the
taxpayers
to
fund
their
lives.
It
would
help
to
prevent
fraudulent
payments
by
requiring
Mainers
who
take
GA
to
account
for
why
they
require
financial
assistance
from
the
state.
These
five
bills
would
inject
commonsense
requirements
into
Maine’s
overlapping
welfare
schemes
and
help
to
uphold
the
highest
levels
of
accountability.
Maine’s
private
sector
workforce
has
barely
reached
its
pre-lockdown
job
levels;
they
are
sorely
needed.

Title
22,
§4307:
Municipality
of
responsibility;
residency
Please
deem
LDs
182
183,
268,
364,
and
454
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
safeguard
against
abuse
of
these
crucial
resources,
dedicated
to
those
who
are
truly
struggling,
and
not
for
those
who
are
able
to
support
themselves.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
