Before the Committee on Health and Human Services 
Friday, May 5, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services I am Senator Eric Brakey, representing the people of Auburn, New 
Gloucester, Poland, and Durham 1 am before you today to present ﬁve bills (LDs 182, 183, 268, 
364, and 454), each proposing an mdividual reform to the General Assistance Program For the 
sake of time, I will not mdividually read the titles 
All of these proposals origmate from conversations I have had over the years with municipal 
Welfare directors (Who operate the General Assistance Program) since my ﬁrst term serving m 
the Maine Senate Each bill is aimed at ensuring limited resources are utilized for mtended 
purposes with accountability measures to minimize abuse 
Let’s walk through them one-by-one
L.D. 364, "An Act to Proh|bit the Use of General Assnstance 
as a Replacement for Avallable Resources" 
Th1s leg1slat1on would ensure General Assrstance funct1ons properly as the Welfare program of 
last resort that 1t 1s supposed to be 
Th1s b1ll estabhshes that an appl1cant for general ass1stance who voluntanly abandons (or refuses 
to use) an avarlable resource wlthout _]1lS1I cause would be mel1g1ble to rece1ve general ass1stance 
to replace the abandoned resource for a penod of 120 days from the date the resource was 
abandoned 
An "avarlable resource" 1s a resource that 1s 1mmed.1ately avarlable or can be secured w1thout 
delay For example, th1s could be housmg that 1s offered from a fam1ly member or prov1ded for 
under another (chantable or taxpayer-funded) program 
As drafted, there would be many recogmzed Just causes If any of the followmg were the cause 
for abandonmg the resource, the appl1cant ’s qual1ﬁcat1on would be unaffected 
A An unreasonable requrrement placed on the appl1cant or appl1cant ’s household 
by the prov1der of the ava11able resource that mterferes w1th any nght secured by 
the Umted States Const1tut1on or the Const1t11t1on of Mame, 
B D1scr1m1nat1on on the bas1s of actual or perce1ved race, color, sex, sexual 
or1entat1on, gender 1dent1ty, phys1cal or mental d1sab111ty, re11g1on, ancestry or 
natlonal ongm, age or fam1l1al status,' 
C The use of the ava1lable resource Jeopard1z1ng the health or safety of an 
apphcant or appl1cant's household, 
D A natural dlsaster that makes the ava1lab1e resource urunhabuable or 
unava11able, 
E Abandonment of shelter housmg m order to obtam permanent housmg, 
F Inab111ty to access ava1lable resources due to a lack of publ1c or pnvate 
transportauon or medlcal 1]lness or mjury, 
G Any _]l.1S1Z cause wh1ch Would exempt an md1v1dual from the GA Work 
reqmrement (mcludmg phys1cal or mental 1llness or d1sab1l1ty, below-mmJmum 
wages, sexual harassment, phys1cal or mental mab111ty to perform requ1red _]0b 
tasks, mab1l1ty to work requlred hours or to meet p1ece work standards, lack of 
transportauon to and from Work or trammg, mab1hty to arrange for necessary 
ch1ld care or care of an 111 or d1sabled fam1ly member, and any reason found to be 
good cause by the Department of Labor) 
H Any other ev1dence that 1s reasonable and appropnate 
The b1ll also makes an appl1cant who forfe1ts rece1pt of or causes a reduct1on m beneﬁts ﬁom an 
ava1lable resource due to fraud, m1srepresentat1on or mtent1onal v1olat1on or refusal to comply 
W1th rules w1thout _]U.SlZ cause mel1g1ble to rece1ve general ass1stance to replace the forferted or
I 
reduced beneﬁts for the durat1on of the sanctron nnposed on the applrcant for vrolatlon of a rule 
or 120 days, wh1chever1s greater 
I hope you w1ll all consrder passmg th1s reform to ensure lmnted resources are preserved for 
those who do not have access to altemat1ves 
L.D. 182, "An Act to Create a 9-month Time Lim|t on General Assistance 
Benefits for Able-bodied Adults Without Dependents" 
Both of the next two b1lls regard t1me hnnts on the General Ass1stance Program 
L D 182 would l1rmt to a maxrmum of 275 days every 5 years the general ass1stance beneﬁtsa 
person Who does not have any dependents and who 1s capable of Workmg may recerve 
If the comrmttee moves forward on th1s proposal, I would recommend adopt1ng the standard of 
able-bodled adults wrthout dependents (ABAWDs) under SNAP 
Between 18-49 years of age, 
Not pregnant, 
Not resldmg 1n a household where a household member 1s under age 18, 
Mentally and physrcally ﬁt for employment 
Th1s would ensure GA 1s avarlable as a short-term safety net of last resort for ABAWDs, and not 
used as a long-term hammock that suppresses those capable of achlevmg mdependence 
L.D. 183, “An Act to Incorporate Time Limits on the 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program 
|nto Municipal General Assistance Programs “ 
L D 183 prov1des that a person who has exhausted the 60-month (5 years) l1fet1me l1m1t on 
Temporary Ass1stance for Needy F am1l1es (TANF) program beneﬁts 1s mel1g1ble to recelve 
mumcrpal general ass1stance program beneﬁts for a penod of 5 years, except that a person who 1s 
m the process of seek1ng an extenslon of TANF beneﬁts may be consrdered e11g1ble 
Th1s pol1cy was asked for by mumcrpal welfare ofﬁclals who observed that md1v1dua1s were 
hlttmg the 5 year l1m1t on TANF, then sw1tch1ng mto the GA program m order to contmue 
recervmg beneﬁts — rendenng the hfetune hm1t purposeless and shrftmg the burden from 
federal tax dollars to state and local tax dollars 
It 1s Worth notlng that the TANF l1fet1me lnmts ex1st because the prograrn ’s stated purpose 1s 
temporary ass1stance to help a parent trans1t1on back mto the Workforce When those l1m1ts are 
bemg exceeded, 1t suggests the program 1s not Work1ng 
In short, th1s proposal would help enforce the hfet1me l1m1t that already ex1sts
L.D. 268, "An Act to Establish a 45-day Munic|pal Residency Requlrement for 
General Assistance Programs" 
The next two b1lls propose res1dency requrrements to ensure the lmnted resources of our GA 
programs catch resrdents m need wrthout functromng as a magnet to non-resldents relocatmg for 
the purpose of collectmg welfare beneﬁts 
L D 268 would establ1sh a 45-day mun1c1pal res1dency requrrernent For an 1nd1v1dua1 to qua11fy 
for mun1c1pal general asslstance, he or she would need to have hved m the mun1c1pal1ty for at 
least a month and a half 
Th1s 1s another approach to solvmg a problem addressed by L D 763 (regardmg avarlable 
resources) Th1s would prevent someone from abandomng the1r housmg srtuatron 1n another 
_]1l1'lSd1ClZ1OI1, movmg to a new mumclpahty, and demandmg local taxpayers to pay therr way 
If the comm1ttee prefers th.1s approach, I would recommend adoptmg the _]1lSlZ cause exceptlons 
drafted 1n L D 763 
L.D. 454, "An Act to Establlsh a 180-day State Resndency 
Requ|rement for Munlcipal General Ass|stance" 
L D 454 would estabhsh a 180-day state res1dency requrrement for General Asslstance In order 
to quahfy, an 1nd1v1dual would demonstrate they have hved 1n the state for a 1I11I1].H11.1II1 of s1x 
months 
Over the last decade, GA resources (and all pubhc resources) have been stretched to the lJII11lI 1n 
mumcrpahtres, hke Portland, due to the contmued arnval of new people 1nto the state W1thout 
resources to establrsh themselves for mdependent hvmg From conversatrons w1th my 
colleagues, 1t 1s generally recogmzed that th1s has reached a cr1s1s level We do not have the 
resources to take m more people, and yet ex1s11ng pol1cy contmues promlsmg resources We do 
not have, attractmg more people who arnve to drscover that even adequate shelter 1s not 
avallable 
In 2015, the Leg1slature chose to make Mame an outher among the states, promlsmg 
state-ﬁmded welfare beneﬁts through the GA program to asylum seekers who do not quallfy for 
federal ass1stance due to then" 1mm1grat1on status In 2019, the Mayor of Portland (to the d1smay 
of crty staff already deadlme w1th overstretched resources) made natronally pubhcrzed comments 
to “bnng them on” regardmg asylum seekers commg to Portland These pubhc pol1c1es and 
pubhc declaratrons have all had obvrous consequences, contnbutmg to the CI‘lSlS of resources we 
are expenencmg today 
A SIX month res1dency requlrement on GA beneﬁts would shut down the welfare magnet By 
settmg an effectrve date at least s1x months from now, the Leg1slature could ensure those who are 
presently here would contmue to quahfy, but close the wmdow so that we do not contmue 
1ncent1v1zmg more people to move here under the false prom1se that Mame taxpayers can 
provrde for them 
Thank you all for your t1me and cons1derat1on on these matters I would be happy to take 
questrons to the best of my ab1l11.y
