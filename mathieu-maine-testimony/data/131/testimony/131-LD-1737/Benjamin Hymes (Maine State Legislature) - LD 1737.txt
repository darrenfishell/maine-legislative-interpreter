Good Morning, Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Taxation I am Representative Benjamin Hymes and I represent the 
towns of Brooks, Frankfort, Jackson, Knox, Monroe, Swanville, Thorndike, Unity, and Waldo in 
House District 38 I am here today to present LD 1737 "An Act to Provide up to $5,000 in 
Property Tax Relief to Veterans" 
First off, I would like to say that this is my pet project bill Since I retired last summer after 20 
years on active duty, I have made it my unofficial duty to represent and help Veterans Because 
of my service I have a unique understanding of what is working and what is not I also havea 
very good understanding of what would be fair in the eyes of Veterans when we are considering 
bills such as these I have been and am continuing to tweak this bill as I have conversations 
around the state with Veterans So the bill before you has a few minor changes that I will add to 
my committee amendment which will be forthcoming 
I'd like to take a quick minute to explain where we are to give context as to why property tax 
needs to be expanded 
Currently, a veteran who served during a recognized war period and is 62 years or older, or, is 
receiving 100% disability as a Veteran, or became 100% disabled while serving, is eligible for 
$6,000 A veteran who received a federal grant for a specially adapted housing unit may receive 
$50,000 
This would seem pretty good, however, as you all know, words matter in Statute Currently the 
relief IS based on taking a portion off the whole property's value and that part is not taxed 
However, the remainder IS still taxed For example, a 100% disabled veteran receives $6000 in 
property tax relief So, if they own a $300,000 estate, $6000 is deducted from that amount and 
not taxed But the other $294,000 is still taxed So, the amount of relief IS only a few dollars, 
hardly any kind of relief 
There are three parts to my bill I want to highlight 
After retirement age, LD 1737 aims to give property tax relief to all veterans over 62, notjust 
those who served in armed conflicts After this age your amount of relief would not be based on 
your disability rating either After talking with other Veterans around the state, I would like to 
add that the characteristic of their discharge needs to be honorable, general under honorable 
conditions, or medical
