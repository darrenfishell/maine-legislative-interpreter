Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Kevin 
Martin, Policy Director for the Department of Environmental Protection, speaking in 
opposition to L.D. 1393. 
L.D. 1393 would require the four Commissioners of the natural resource agencies -

L.D. 1393, Resolve, to Establish the Commission to Examine Programs and Policies Regarding Natural 
Resources and Environmental Protection

Fisheries and Wildlife (DlF\/V), and Marine Resources (DMR) - and a representative of 
OPEGA to form a commission to review the agencies ’ processes and programs, 
improve alignment between the agencies, and receive public comment on these 
matters. While the goal of enhancing coordination among state natural resources 
agencies is worthwhile, a commission is not necessary. 
Each of the four agencies are charged with certain authorities and obligations by state 
and federal laws. Many of the agencies ’ programs are governed by federal grant 
agreements and are subject to regular review and formal audits by federal agencies. 
For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, through the Performance 
Partnership grant, requires DEP to implement a “Priorities and Commitments ” list and 
conduct an annual progress review. The EPA also requires DEP to implement a Quality 
Management Program that complies with EPA’s Environmental Information Quality 
Policy “to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach for consistent 
implementation of continual improvement. “ DACF also has delegation for implementing 
federal programs that must meet minimum federal standards, such as the Meat and 
Poultiy Inspection program, Board of Pesticides Control, Hemp, and the Produce Safety 
Rule. Additionally, the Emergency Food Assistance and Commodity Supplemental Food 
Programs are subject to routine federal audits. Similarly, DIFW receives federal grants 
in five-year cycles, and is subject to federal audit every five years. 
We appreciate the bill sponsor’s intent, but we respectfully disagree that there is 
misalignment between the functions of natural resource agencies and statewide 
priorities. The agencies are administering laws enacted by the Legislature under the 
leadership of commissioners appointed by the Governor; by definition, we are aligned 
with the priorities of the state. The Commissioners of the four agencies already meet 
regularly to discuss matters that affect multiple agencies. Maine law already requires

that the agencies serve as interagency reviewers for various activities and projects, 
such as reviewing wildlife impacts for land use licenses, to minimize redundant staffing 
and ensure cross-agency alignment. The four agencies also coordinate regularly with 
the Governor ’s Office of Policy, Innovation and the Future (GOPIF), on priorities for use 
of federal funds, on grant applications and as members of the Climate Council. 
The four natural resource agencies are already collaborating to find ways to improve 
efficiencies within and between our programs. At a time when we are struggling to 
attract and retain employees, we have no bandwidth for inefficiencies and encourage all 
our employees to bring forward ideas for doing our work together better. We know there 
is room for improvement, but we do not need to form a commission to figure that out. 
Staff throughout our agencies consider thousands of public comments on the 
effectiveness and efficiency of our programs every year. Even though we do not 
respond to most of them, we do hear them. When we find a problem with our governing 
statutes, or a problem that should be addressed by the Legislature, we have the ability 
to submit an agency bill. 
The analysts at the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability are 
skilled at auditing agency processes, and we would be happy to explore opportunities to 
take better advantage of their staff as a resource. However, conducting a legislatively 
mandated, formalized review of all programs and functions of each of the four 
designated agencies would be a time-consuming, papervvork-generating exercise that is 
unlikely to produce different results than is already being accomplished through ongoing 
inter-agency collaboration. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony. Representatives of the DEP will 
be available at work session.
