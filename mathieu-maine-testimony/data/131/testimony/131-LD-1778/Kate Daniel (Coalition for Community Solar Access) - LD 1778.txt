Re: Testimony In Oppositron to LD 1778 
To Senator Lawrence, RepresentatIve ZeIgler, and Members of the Energy. UtIIItIes and 
Technology Comm|ttee 
Please consIder thIs testImony In opposItIon to LD 1778 The CoaIItIon for CommunIty 
Solar Access (CCSA) Is a natIonal CoalItIon of busInesses and non-profIts workIng to expand 
customer choIce and access to solar for all AmerIcan households and busInesses through 
communIty solar Our mIssIon Is to empower every AmerIcan energy consumer wIth the optIon 
to choose local, clean, and affordable communIty solar We work wIth customers, utIIItIes, local 
stakeholders, and poIIcymakers to develop and Implement poIIcIes and best practIces that 
ensure communIty solar programs provIde a wIn, wIn, wIn for all, startIng wIth the customer 
In the last few weeks, the topIc of net energy bIIIIng has recelved quIte a bIt of attentIon In fact, 
just a month ago I offered testImony on the same bIII language In front of us today that also 
appeared In LD 1347 I wIIl not repeat the same testImony here, but Instead wIII offer a few 
addItIonal thoughts for your consIderatIon 
CCSA Is not assertIng that NEB does not have a ratepayer Impact, or that It Is a perfect 
program But we are concerned that the dIscourse around program costs has not captured the 
full pIcture of solar programs In MaIne, and a rash decIsIon In reactIon to that dIscourse wIlI lead 
to bad pubIIc poIIcy As we have stated before, the $220 mIllIon cost ﬁgure beIng referenced Is 
overstated and not representatIve of the NEB program The utIlItIes' fIIIngs Include projectlons 
that do not hold up to scrutIny CMP’s cost estImates overestImate the number of pl'0j6C’tS IIkeIy 
to come on|Ine In the next two years, overestImate the amount of energy they wIIl produce, and 
do not properly account for the number of projects that wIII recerve a reduced tarIff rate due to 
last year’s Iegrslatron UtIIIty ratemakIng Is complex, and hoIdIng up that ﬁgure In IsolatIon to 
other costs and Investments In our electnc system Is mIsleadIng The ﬁgures clted do not 
account for any of the grId beneﬁts that ratepayers wIII see In the form of lower deIIvery and 
standard offer rates down the lIne - resultIng from reduced transmIssIon charges, lower energy 
prIces resultIng from more local generatIon, and the Improvements to grId Infrastructure that 
solar projects make when they connect to the grId 
We can acknowledge that MaIne‘s solar programs can be Improved to provIde a better value for 
ratepayers We cannot do that In a way that Impacts exIstIng contracts and agreements Other 
states have learned that lesson the hard way In late 2015, the PublIc UtIIItIes CommIssIon of 
Nevada Implemented reforms to net meterIng that reduced the bIII savIngs solar customers

could realize Those changes were applied to existing solar customers as well as future 
installations, pulling the rug out from thousands of residents and small businesses that relied on 
savings from their solar investments As a result, the three largest solar providers left the state, 
thousands of solar workers lost their ]ObS, the utility faced a class action lawsuit from customers, 
utility commissioners faced public backlash and calls to resign, and eventually, two years later, 
the legislature restored the original policy‘ Nevada has become the cautionary tale in how 
retroactive policy changes can destroy a viable industry and create deep distrust in public 
institutions, let us learn from others’ mistakes and instead work to implement more viable 
solutions 
There are better solutions to ensure that Maine can continue sustainable solar development 
while benefiting all Maine ratepayers The Distributed Generation 2 O Stakeholder Working 
Group has already identified program designs that can achieve significant net benefits to 
ratepayers, and we should build upon the work already done through that effort We also must 
take the rare opportunity this year to secure hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding to 
apply to solar programs serving low and moderate income customers These are solutions that 
will take Maine forward, not backward 
For these reasons, we respectfully urge the committee to vote ought not to pass\
