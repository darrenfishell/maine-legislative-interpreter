Re: Testimony in opposition to LD 1778, “An Act to Ensure a Sustainable Electric Grid” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee 1
, 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Comerstone Government Affairs Group 
here to testify in opposition to LD 1778 on behalf of our client the Maine Renewable Energy 
Association (“MREA”) 
For the last few years there is no likely no other issue that has received more time and attention 
from this committee than Net Energy Billing (“NEB”) It is clear there are those who wish to see 
today’s NEB policy to continue unimpeded, others who wish to see lessons learned and applied 
to a successor program, and still others who want to see it entirely halted 
In fact, in the last three years there has been not E1 , but £2 retroactive policy changes 
enacted and applied to many of the p1‘O_]6C’[S attempting to reach commercial operation under 
today’s NEB law — notably, the industry willingly participated in many of these conversations 
and ultimately did not oppose either one Spme of you on this committee rightly chose to usea 
scalpel to make targeted changes to the NEB program, unfortunately, LD 177 8 isa 
sledgehaminer 
To be clear, the NEB program is not perfect — but neither 1S any other energy or even non-energy 
policy the Legislature creates and state agencies implement What 1S nnportant is that this 
committee dedicates time to these programs, studies them closely, and ultimately designs policy 
improvements for the next iteration of the policy to continue delivering value to Maine 
consumers and predictable processes for developers airmng to deploy their capital here If we 
care about the state’s busmess reputation, our commitment to addressing clnnate change, and to 
offermg constuners a choice about which sources of energy powers their homes and businesses, 
we cannot and must not continue trying to retroactively change or — m the case of LD 1778- 
completely eliminate programs A nmnber of states are on their 2"“ , 3“ , or 4*” iteration of their

d1str1buted generatron (“DG”) pol1c1es — and they have w1sely chosen to prospectlvely apply 
lessons learned to the1r successor programs, as opposed to trymg to stop mvestment 1n 1ts tracks 
as thrs leg1slat1on would do 
It 1s 1mportant to remember that our DG resources are offermg meanmgful value to consumers, 
to the gr1d, and those compan1es act1vely mvolved 1n developmg and construct1ng them There 
are gnd upgrades bemg pa1d for by DG companles nght now — and 1n the end those mvestments 
wrll help reduce future grid resiliency costs as we continue our pursuit of beneﬁclal 
electnﬁcatron 
We must also draw your attentron to the fact that our gr1d’s l1m1tat1ons effectrvely place a natural 
cap on the number of pro] ects and megawatts that w1ll be able to mterconnect and become 
operatronal As recently as last year we spoke to th1s commntee about pro]ectattnt1on rates that 
we expected would be somewhere 1n the 50-60% range for a number reasons (e g , gr1d 
lrmltatrons, penmttlng challenges, supply chaln lssues, and more) Based on more recent 
lnformatron commg out of cluster studles, 1t appears that our attntron percentage estrmates have 
proven to be far too low As of now, we expect attr1t1on W111 cause 80-90% of projects to not be 
burlt 
As often happens, there are those who may provlde lnformatron speakmg about cost concems but 
1t 1s equally rmportant to balance that consrderatron w1th the ant1c1pated beneﬁts Accordlng toa 
2021 study by Daymark Energy Adv1sors3 , the NEB program 1s helpmg to stlmulate our 
economy Specrﬁcally, 1f we were to assume approxlmately 900 megawatts of NEB pro]ects 
become operatronal, they are estlmated to support 7,000 ]ob-years and $782 m1ll1on 1n economrc 
act1v1ty 1n Marne 
We were glad to play an actrve role 1n the DG 2 0 stakeholder process led by the Governor ’s 
Energy Ofﬁce — and we loolc forward to bemg able to speak to those rdeas 1n the weeks ahead to 
help deslgn a successor program to bu1ld on the successes of NEB 
Th1s leg1slat1on also proposes removmg the so-called “100 megawatt cap,” and th1s 1dea has 
come before tlns commrttee twrce th1s sess1on (and many tlmes before), and has been repeatedly 
re] ected pnmarlly for four reasons 
1) It would run counter to the long-standmg mtent of Ma1ne’s Renewable Po1tfol1o Standard 
(“RPS”), whrch 1s to mcent as much 1n-state (or at least 1n-reglon) clean energy 
development as possrble to help d1vers1ty our energy mrx, reduce envrromnental rmpacts, 
and to encourage lnvestment and the creatlon of new ]obs, 
2) Today’s RPS 1n Mame — m comb1nat1on w1th those of other New England states — has led 
to slgnlﬁcant mvestment by MREA member compames, total1ng well over $2 b1ll1on 1n 
the last two decades, paymg more than $25 m1ll1on annually 1n property taxes and 
employmg over 2,500 Malners,

3) Ex1st1ng statute places very reasonable geographrc hnntatlons on those resources that are 
el1g1ble, and specrﬁcally allows renewable energy that 1s dehvered 1nto the New England 
bulk power system, regardless of where 1t 1s generated, to quahfy for the RPS Th1s 
mcludes resources owned and operated by the Canadlan government, mcludrng Hydro 
Quebec (“HQ”) and New Brunswlck Power Notably, accord1ng to page 115 of thelr 
2022 am1ua1 report, HQ currently has 16 hydro generatmg statlons rated less than 100 
MW totahng 680 MW, for whlch they have not sought Mame RPS certlﬁcatlon One has 
to wonder why they have never pursued cert1ﬁcat1on for the RPS, and 
4) Lastly, 1t 1s nnportant to understand why the cap ex1sts at all — when restructurmg 
occurred 1n the last 1990s the largest 1n-state renewable generator was Wyman hydro, 
followed by Hams ThlS 1s st1ll true today for Mame-based hydropower assets, w1th 
Wyman at 85MW and Harms at 82MW In years past, th1s commrttee saw ﬁt to adjust 
the el1g1b1l1ty standards to make room for Mame-based clean energy pI‘O_]€CtS 1n excess of 
l00MW (e g Krbby Wmd at l32MW, and 152MW Three Corners solar p1‘O_]6C'[ under 
constructlon 1n Benton, Clmton and Umty Townslnp) 
Th1s change may also lead to drastlcally oversupplymg the RPS market w1th thousands of 
megawatts of Canad1an- government owned hydropower, Wl’1lCh would crash the pnce of 
Renewable Energy Cert1ﬁcates (“RECs”) Desp1te clalms to the contrary, 1f large—sca1e 
hydropower was made el1g1ble for Ma1ne’s RPS there 1s no ev1dence 1t would supply Mame w1th 
lower cost power — and 1t would certamly dlscourage lnvestment 1n Mame-based renewables 1f 
prlvate compames are asked to compete w1th govermnent-owned generatlon 
Ult1mately, the quest1on 1s whether state 1ncent1ve programs are meant to help grow Ma1ne’s 
homegrown clean energy economy, or to send ratepayer dollars to corporatrons owned and 
operated by the Canadlan government ‘? 
We respectfully urge you to vote ought not to pass
