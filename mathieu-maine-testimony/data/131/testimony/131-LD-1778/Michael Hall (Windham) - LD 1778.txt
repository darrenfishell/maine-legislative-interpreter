Net energy billing is a billing and metering practice that allows customers who 
generate their own electricity to receive a credit on their utility bill for the excess 
electricity they generate. This valuable program helps customers save money on their 
energy bills and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.
However, net energy billing is not fair to all customers. It benefits customers who can 
afford to install their own renewable energy systems while disadvantaging customers 
who cannot afford to do so. This is because net energy billing customers can generate 
electricity and sell it to the grid. In contrast, other customers must purchase all their 
electricity from the grid.
LD 1778 would level the playing field for all customers by prohibiting net energy 
billing. This would ensure all customers have an equal opportunity to save money on 
their energy bills and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.
I urge you to vote in favor of LD 1778.
