Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1778:
“An
Act
to
Ensure
a
Sustainable
Electric
Grid”
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities,
and
Technology,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
nonprofit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1778
.
The
current
situation
is
dire.
Ratepayers
are
still
reeling
from
record
rate
increases
year-over-year
since
2021,
1
face
yet
another
$9
monthly
hike
on
average
this
July,
and
more
incremental
increases
to
fund
investments
by
Central
Maine
Power
(CMP)
into
the
grid.

If
that
wasn’t
enough,
our
state
Public
Advocate
is
warning
that
well-intentioned
“green
energy”
programs
like
community
solar
will
make
the
situation
for
ratepayers
even
worse.

The
Mills
administration
is
openly
acknowledging
that
it
is
blocking
the
entrance
of
cheaper
power
into
the
market
in
favor
of
protecting
its
friends
in
the
biomass
industry.

Misguided
politicians
running
the
states
within
our
regional
electric
grid,
ISO-NE,
are
rejecting
reliable
base-load
power
sources
like
nuclear
and
hydroelectric
power
in
favor
of
intermittent,
unreliable
sources
like
wind
and
solar.
Fundamentally,
this
ethos
is
restricting
supply
and
has
led
to
New
Englanders
paying
the
second-highest
electricity
rates
in
the
nation.
5
Our
energy
policy
is
sorely
off-track.
LD
1778
offers
several
key
reforms
to
decrease
pressure
on
electricity
rates
by
leveling
the
playing
field
for
all
types
of
energy
generation
instead
of
tilting
the
balance
in
favor
of
those
energy
sources
which
are
preferred
by
some
politicians
and
their
donors.
The
laws
of
the
natural
universe
compel
us
to
reject
favoritism
of
solar
panels
and
wind
turbines.
They
are
simply
too
inefficient
and
resource-heavy
on
which
to
stake
the
future
of
our
energy
supply.
Firstly,
it
repeals
net
energy
billing,
a
policy
failure
which
has
been
unnecessarily
costly
for
ratepayers.
Secondly,
it
repeals
the
economically
destructive
cap
on
renewable

energy
plants
which
are
greater
than
100
MW
capacity,
unless
they
are
wind
or
solar
farms.
Why
does
the
capacity
of
a
particular
generation
project
matter
if
the
technology
used
generates
no
emissions
and
contributes
to
lowering
greenhouse
gas
emissions,
the
stated
goal
of
the
state’s
renewable
portfolio
standards
(RPS)
program?
This
question
alone
highlights
the
farce
that
is
RPS.
Instead
of
being
aligned
to
environmental
health
and
the
goal
of
making
power
without
harmful
emissions,
it
instead
has
become
a
cudgel
for
activists
and
politicians
to
mold
the
state
and
its
residents
to
their
radical
values.
That
is
why
LD
1778
also
repeals
RPS,
to
end
the
wasteful
misallocation
of
resources
which
occurs
when
the
state
picks
winners
and
losers
in
the
energy
market.
Lastly,
it
frees
Maine
ratepayers
from
the
costs
imposed
by
Maine’s
participation
in
the
Regional
Greenhouse
Gas
Initiative
(RGGI).
The
bill
caps
the
amount
the
state
may
spend
on
carbon
efficiency
credits
within
RGGI
to
$5
per
metric
ton
(MT)
of
carbon
saved,
requiring
any
fees
above
that
be
reimbursed
to
ratepayers.
This
reform
is
critical
to
align
the
interests
of
ratepayers
with
the
real-world
carbon
reduction
benefits
achieved
through
RGGI,
which
are
dubious
at
best.
RGGI
reports
disclose
that
$2.5
billion
has
been
invested
on
efficiency
measures,
claiming
to
have
saved
49.5
MT
of
carbon
over
the
lifetime
of
the
program:
$51
per
ton
of
carbon.
6
Yet,
the
price
of
RGGI
credits
are
capped
at
$7.65
per
credit,
equal
to
1
MT
of
carbon
emitted.
How
can
RGGI
claim
to
lower
carbon
emissions
if
it
is
spending
six-times
more
to
“save”
a
ton
of
carbon
than
it
charges
emitters
to
“spend”
the
same
ton
of
carbon?
This
bill
presents
an
opportunity
for
this
legislature
to
correct
the
policy
mistakes
which
have
been
made
in
recent
decades
and
led
to
crushingly-high
power
costs.
Please
deem
LD
1778
“Ought
To
Pass”
to
take
politics
out
of
energy
markets,
increase
supply
to
put
downward
pressure
on
electricity
prices,
and
diversify
the
power
grid.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
