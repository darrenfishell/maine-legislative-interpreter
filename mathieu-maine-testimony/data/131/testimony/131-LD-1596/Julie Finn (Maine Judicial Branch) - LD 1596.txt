Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 1596, An Act to Facilitate the 
Creation of an Aroostook County Drug Treatment Court: 
 
 Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony with respect to this bill. 
 
 LD 1596 is limited to the establishment of one Assistant District Attorney (ADA) 
position in Aroostook County. The Judicial Branch thus takes no position on the merits of the 
bill. 
 
 Because the stated purpose is to facilitate creation of a drug treatment court, however, we 
feel we should comment on the other resources critical to the creation of a specialty docket. 
Judicial Branch Administrative Order JB-16-01 addresses the establishment of new specialty 
courts and the resource components as follows: 
 
A. Specialty dockets will be approved only when specific and identified 
resources, including judge time, clerk staff, and security are available within the Judicial 
Branch to support the specialty docket.  
B. Specialty dockets will be approved only when the necessary and sufficient 
resources external to the Judicial Branch have been identified and have demonstrated a 
commitment to the process and requirements of the specialty docket. 
 
Specialty dockets not only require additional JB resources which are currently unavailable, but 
also sufficient external resources under Part B such as a case manager through Maine Pretrial 
Services, or a similar organization. 
 
 Even though LD 1596 does not actually purport to create a new Drug Treatment Court, it 
is important to point out the additional resources that would be needed in order to do so. 
 
 Thank you for your consideration.
