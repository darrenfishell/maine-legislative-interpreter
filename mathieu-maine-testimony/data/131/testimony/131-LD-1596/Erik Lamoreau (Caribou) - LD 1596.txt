LD 1596
My name is Erik Lamoreau and I am a citizen of Caribou.  I am a person in long term 
recovery for over 9 years.  I am testify today in the support of the creation of the 
Court Treatment Program LD 1596 in Aroostook County. 
We have a crisis on our hands.  Our jail is full!  Over full!  as of this morning over 
145 individuals our in Aroostook county custody.  More than 90% of those 
individuals are on pretrial charges and many of them on drug related issues.  Data 
shows that many are in dire need of treatment for Substance Use Disorder.  
Unfortunately, Many will not receive it as they will remain under residency of the 
state until they are sentenced.  It is time to create at Treatment Court option in 
Aroostook County.  To my knowledge we are the last county in Maine not to have a 
treatment court option.  Aroostook County has many challenges, daily I hear people 
say there is no workforce, that we are paying to much to keep people in jail,  I hear 
guards at Aroostook County Jail say they are working 60-70 hours a week.  Treatment
Court will take the pressure off of our jail correction staff, our overfull legal 
caseloads, help support our workforce challenges, our counties budget, and most 
importantly provide a treatment option for our people with Substance use disorder.  It 
is time to act on a solution driven, proven evidence based model of treatment for our 
addicted citizens.  Please support LD 1596, Aroostook County addicts deserve the 
same treatment options as the rest of the state.
