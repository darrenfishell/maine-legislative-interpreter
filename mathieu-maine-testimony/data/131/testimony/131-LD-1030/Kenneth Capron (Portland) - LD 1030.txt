My testimony that the demographic workforce shortage is relevant to the three bills 
381, 918, and 1030. Despite your good intentions, there is NO solution to the shortage
of bus drivers. To the extent that someone moves from another job to being a driver 
only adds to the shortages elsewhere.
Regardless of age, regardless of required qualifications, regardless of all other factors 
- there will not be enough drivers (nor mechanics) for years to come. The only 
solution is to adopt an autonomous solution that doesn't need drivers. 
For those reasons, I feel compelled to point out the solutions provided by SkyWay by 
MicroRail. It assures safer transportation for all students at a very minimal cost with a
carbon-free self-powering "system".
The Department of Education should be tasked with analyzing this option and 
opportunity.
