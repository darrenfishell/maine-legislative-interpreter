Good Morning Deputy Curtis and Director lreland, 
On behave our the owners of Cyr Bus company we want to share our deep appreciation for meeting with us 
last Wednesday February 22, 2023. . 
Just want to recap on the topics and points of discussion we covered during our meeting. Please forgive me 
they won't be in the order that they were covered. 
1 Entry Level Driver Training - Ruled by the FMCSA in December 2016 - Implemented February 2022. We
I 
expressed our concerns it is taking 3 to 4 months longer to train a candidate to receive a Class B - PS 
license to driver a School bus. 
2. There has been some scheduling difficulty in retaking test for permits, for a long time, it is the extra time 
and money. Maybe to have the ability to retake that day or within the next week. 
3. Once a candidate gets their permit they are told to hold it for 2 weeks before mailing and if you don't they 
will hold it back in the scheduling office. 
4. Along with improvements to the above concerns, we'feel it would be beneficial to the School 
Transportation industry, if the curriculum could focus on a school bus license without all the extra 
information and some of the repetitiveness that a candidate has to study. We believe it would help with 
brining people in without them looking at a 6 months commitment before they get their School Bus 
License. .. 
5. information was shared how to shorten the time on the ELD Training, and the Maine CDL permit testing. 
This will be looked into by Director lreland to make sure it‘s do-able.' 
6. information was shared on tactics we have done already to bring people into the industry - covering Hours 
- beneﬁts - wages - paid time wages » and unemployment benefits. 
7. The part discussed on the unemployment benefits for MSAD or RSU's that are school operated 
buses may be added and addressed on a new bill that is being considered in the State house soon. 
8. There will be some inquiry on the State of New Hampshire having a school bus certificate to drivea 
school bus to drive just in the state. 
9. Legislature Drinkwater mention a person 16 years of age could drive a tractor trailer with-in the 
boundaries of the state of Maine and could an exception be made for School bus drivers drive the 
boundaries of the state of Maine bus not necessarily before the age of 21. 
10. Director lreland would like more information of incidences of candidates being turned away the day of 
their driving test and why some people can switch their CDLs from some states when they come into the 
state of Maine but not others.... a Federal CDL was supposed to allow drivers the freedom to drive in other 
states and switch their licenses if they moved to said state.' 
11. it was mentioned that our state house may have their hands tied to make changes due to funding that 
beneﬁts the state and that the CDL and the ELDT is Federally Mandated. There was true concern for the 
struggles we go through and reaching out to our Representatives in Washington may help get our 
situation moving along on a positive journey. Legislature Drinkwater said he has been in touch with 
* 
Senator Susan Collins, and she is in favor of working on this together. 
12. Director lreland commented the J.J. Keller book for EDLT training is not mandatory. We added that the 
way the material is laid out and the test they provide, makes it much easier to cover all the Material the 
FMCSA had mandated and the 90 topics theory and hands on training. Director lreland also added they 
may be the company to reach out to to create a school bus drivers training curriculum if this idea is able to 
go forward.' 
_ 13. The question came up about what does "Buses" mean in the FMCSA- did it mean Coach buses - School 
Buses or all buses. Director lreland was going to look investigate further. 
l hope l covered all the main points to the meeting - l am sorry l didn't take notes. My position once again would 
be to take steps towards a School bus license in Maine. Having the curriculum and training be focused on 
Transportation of students - Training on the school bus - Drivers education for school buses and all that pertains 
to making a well informed capable individual focused on what theirjob and responsibilities would be. Atraining 
focused on making a successful candidate with out material that is not pertinent to school bus driving. Not to 
lessen the training but to be more focused on what it takes to be a school bus driver. 
Sincerely, 
Melanie Van Aken
