We, The People of Maine, have miles of environmental transportation infrastructure 
currently available to utilize throughout our State right now. 
As a State we have the ability to effectively help our local and National environment 
and economy by extending passenger rail further into our State via utilizing these rail 
lines now.
Rail lines, as well as passenger rail, are highly environmental, economical and 
emotionally viable for the People of our State, as well as future generations, to benefit
and preserve our State's habitats, air quality, financial gains and tangible connection 
to our State. 
Now is the time, more than ever before, to incorporate additional passenger rail 
service to our State.
