Ladies and gentlemen of the Maine Committee of Financial Affairs and 
Appropriations, I stand before you today with a passionate belief in the immense 
value of our Maine-owned railroads. It is disheartening to see rail projects 
consistently overlooked in favor of road bonds in the past. However, this session, I am
hopeful that the importance of Maine's railroads has been recognized and given due 
consideration. I commend you for the attention you have given to the various bills 
regarding rail transportation and recreational trails, as these discussions hold 
tremendous significance.
This is not simply a matter of state policy and investment; it holds the key to driving 
local economies and maximizing returns on our state resources. Now is not the time to
hastily tear up railroads without careful thought and planning. We have heard a 
multitude of voices from diverse backgrounds, including businesses, recreational 
enthusiasts, and environmental advocates, all expressing their desire for a $30 million 
trails Bond. This sounds like an excellent opportunity, as long as it does not entail the 
destruction of our valuable rail infrastructure.
Maine is currently in a unique position when it comes to transportation infrastructure 
investment. With the expected $400 million special purpose general fund bonding, we
have the chance to match an incredible $1 billion in federal funding. In addition, let us
not forget the previous $500 million in federal pandemic subsidies for roads and 
bridges. The Maine Department of Transportation does not require further bonding 
for these purposes. This surplus bonding capacity presents us with an opportunity to 
explore alternative funding avenues, such as trails and, yes, even rails. We can design 
projects that encompass both, creating what are known as Greenbeltsâ€”corridors that 
accommodate various modes of transportation, including passenger rail.
Rails with Trails projects have been successfully implemented in other parts of the 
nation. By securing funding from the Federal Transit Administration's GIG program, 
we can create a comprehensive transportation system that encourages multi-modal 
travel, specifically benefiting passenger rail. The services industry is rapidly growing 
in Maine, with thousands of new jobs emerging in the Portland working waterfront 
alone. These service businesses, ranging from schools to hospitals to high-tech 
industries, thrive in town centers throughout the state. It is imperative that we provide 
efficient and accessible means for people to reach these vital locations.
Maine is fortunate to own 125 miles of railroad infrastructure, spanning four 
transportation corridors and connecting over 25 village centers along these routes. 
These centers offer prime opportunities for service industries to establish themselves 
and contribute to the growth of our local communities. They provide spaces for 
housing, services, education, and, of course, recreation. Imagine a Greenbelt design 
that stretches from the Portland downtown waterfront, encompassing 30 miles to 
Auburn, and connecting the vibrant town centers of Falmouth and Yarmouth. This 
design would seamlessly integrate with the Downeaster at Yarmouth Junction, pass 
through Cumberland and Pownal at Pineland, and extend to the Auburn-Lewiston 
municipal airport. Furthermore, it would pave the way for a route to the north, leading
through Bethel and ultimately reaching Montreal.
We have an incredible opportunity before us, and it would be a tremendous loss to let 
it slip away. Therefore, I propose that we unite both the trails and rails bonds into a 
single, reasonable amount. Let us work together to create the most splendid Greenbelt
in the Northeast, simultaneously funding outdoor trails across the entire state. It is 
crucial that we engage in discussions regarding the optimal utilization of our 
state-owned railroads, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders involved.
Maine has the potential to become a shining example of a state that embraces 
sustainable and multi-modal transportation systems. Let us seize this opportunity to 
invest in our future, supporting economic growth, environmental sustainability, and 
enhanced connectivity. I urge you to consider the invaluable benefits that can be 
achieved by combining both trails and rails bonds into a unified vision for Maine's 
transportation infrastructure. By doing so, we can foster a sense of unity and 
collaboration, forging ahead to create a model Greenbelt that serves as a testament to 
our commitment to sustainable, accessible, and interconnected modes of travel. Let us
not only discuss but actively pursue the best utilization of our state-owned railroads, 
ensuring that future generations can reap the benefits of a well-designed and 
comprehensive transportation network. Together, we can build a brighter and more 
prosperous future for the great state of Maine. Thank you.
