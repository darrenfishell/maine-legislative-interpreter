1. Those on the AFA committee that have conflicts of interest should recuse 
themselves (Rotundo, Bennett).
2. Rep.Collings misled the committee with exaggerated statistics. Ridership on the 
Downeaster is NOT 500,000/year. 
3. No mode of transportation can survive on ridership for funding in any substantive 
way. Freight is the only service that can be self sustaining - barely.
4. Any rail line that leads to Interstate Commerce immediately falls under the Federal 
Interstate Commerce laws and the Surface Transportation Board. The State loses 
control of such transactions.
5. None of the rails in Maine could be used for high-speed rail without a severe and 
expensive restoration.
6. As one witness stated, there was interest from the North Conway Railway - 
however the TRA committee already voted ONTP on the relevant bill.
7. In order to raise money for rail improvements, the State could readily sell the rail  
for which this bill seeks funding and then use those funds to improve the rails in 
collaboration with the private interests. Maintenance of these rail lines should not 
become the burden of Maine taxpayers - in addition to the fares they will pay to ride 
these rails.
8. You have been provided a lot of false information.
