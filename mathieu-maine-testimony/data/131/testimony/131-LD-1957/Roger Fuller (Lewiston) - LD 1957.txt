LD 1957
Dear Members of the Appropriations Committee
I would liket to offer testimony in support of ose a bill:
LD 1957 - An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Invest in Maine's 
Railroad Infrastructure.
It is important that we take steps now to create the future we want to see and 
eventually will need to face.  Passenger rail offers a convenient and efficient way to 
link population centers in Maine and across the country, especially with an eventual 
link to Montreal.  
As we face an uncertain energy future, rail systems offer a efficient way to provide 
mast transit across the state. Every indication is that the age of automobile entitlement
is ending, and rail systems provide the efficient systems we need. 
Additionally, rail systems provide access for those unable to drive.  I would have like 
to offer testimony in person; however as a visually impaired person, I am unable to 
drive to Augusta.  My situation requires that I visit Mass Eye and Ear many times a 
year; I often use the DownEaster, and would benefit from a passenger rail service 
extension to Lewiston.
Thank you for your consideration on this most important infrastructure improvement.
