An oxymoron that would make any communist proud:
  " lower overall  energy costs for consumers and lower emission of greenhouse gases 
and other pollutants, " 
If history has taught us anything, it is lowering GHG raises consumer costs.
Is this some new carnival game you are trying to unleash on the people of Maine, like 
a ring toss that never fits over the desired prize?
Like the old song, "Do you believe in magic", this bill wastes the time of the 
government workforce  chasing non-solutions.
When are you going to let the adults take over energy policy for Maine?
If the cost to consumers is to be reduced, it will take the immediate end to chasing 
carbon zero and letting traditional competitive measures guide the market.
I end with a fact, not a magical,mystery tour. The wholesale market bought 
renewables at a 17.3% clip in March 2023 while Maine law mandates 51% renewable 
sales to Maine consumers.Spend the rest of your session trying to figure out how 
those numbers work.
Chasing Carbon Zero is Futile,  Carbon is the Lifeblood of Civilization
