Maine to Specify the Qualifications of Electors
LINDA P HASKELL GARLAND, MAINE 04939 OPPOSE this LD1032
 The constitution of the State of Maine for qualifications of electors is more than 
adequate and safe as it is written . Any change would be detrimental to the safety of 
the State of Maine Elections. I do not agree with the malicious changes of this State of
Maine Constitution.This is my testimony.
