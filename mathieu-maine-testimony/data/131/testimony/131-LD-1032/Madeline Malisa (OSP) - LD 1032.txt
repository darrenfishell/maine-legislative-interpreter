Chair Hickman, Chair Supica,  and honorable members of the committee, my name is 
Madeline Malisa, and I am a Visiting Fellow at the Opportunity Solutions Project. OSP is a 
non-partisan, non -profit organization. We work in more than 40 states across the country 
with one clear goal —to help more people achieve the American Dream.  
I appreciate the opportunity to submit written testimony  in support of LD 1032, which 
would amend the Maine Constitution to specify that non-citizens may not vote in state, 
county, or local elections in Maine.  
Mainers  are passionate about the fundamental right that we all have as Americans to vote 
and participate in our democratic process. We don’t want loopholes and weaknesses in the 
design of elections to threaten that right. Only Mainers should be electing ou r lawmakers. 
And n o voter should have their vote canceled out or diluted by the illegal vote  of somebody 
who has not earned  U.S. citizenship .  
While the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly state who can and cannot vote, federal law 
expressly prohibits no n-citizens from voting in federal elections.1-2 Many state constitutions 
and statutes expressly provide  the qualifications of electors able to vote in state and local 
elections, but do not disallow non -citizens from voting.3 Likewise, Maine’s Constitution 
expressly allows  “every citizen of the United States ” to vote, but it does explicitly state  who  
cannot  vote.4 LD 1032 would clarify the law to ensure that only U.S. citizens are allowed to 
vote in all Maine elections.  
The absence of non-citizen  language has provided a foothold for local jurisdictions to 
interpret state laws and allow non -citizens to vote in municipal races. In 2010 and  2022, 
Portland  lawmakers  considered proposals that would have allowed non -citizens to vote in 
local races.5 Across the country, 15 municipalities allow  non-citizens to vote in local 
elections , including 11 jurisdictions  in Maryland, two in Vermont, and two in California.6 In 
2021, the New York City Council passed a measure that would have allowed 800,000 non -
citizens to vote in local elections, but the law was struck down as unconstitutional by a 
State Supreme Court judge.7 
The state constitutions of Arizona, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Ohio specifically prohibit 
non-citizen  voting. Maine lawmakers have the opportunity to protect  election integrity by 
enacting LD 1032 .  
Maine  voters  should have confidence that regardless of how they cast their ballots, their 
votes will count. For all these reasons, I urge you to support this important legislation. 
Thank you for your time and I’m happy to provide additional information at the request of 
the committee .
