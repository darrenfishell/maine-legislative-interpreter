207-324-5762  Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 619 An Act to 
Ensure Coordination of Care for MaineCare Members  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee On 
Health and Human Services , I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership, the membership association of 
the ten community action agencies in Maine and we support LD 619 An 
Act to Ensure Coordination of Care for MaineCare Members . 
 
We use a Whole Fam ily, or Two Generation Approach to servi ng 
families with children. Beginning with Head Start students and their 
caretaker adults, adding families who come to us for heating assistance, 
weatherization or other of our myriad services, we aim to help families 
out of poverty by both providing services and programs they need at the time whi le engaging in e ducation and workforce development.  
 
Studies have proven that to improve the lives of low -income families in 
the present and future, we need to address the needs of the entire family â€“ so we help the parents or caregivers with their educational 
and/or employment needs, while also ensuring the children have high 
quality early care and education We k now it works both ways: when 
adults thrive, their children thrive; as children do better, their  caregivers 
do better. 
 
In other states, communi ty action agencies also serve to c oordinate 
care for these families  and individuals , therefore assuring physical, 
mental and social needs are attended to. For many years, Head Star t 
staff performed early and periodic screening,  diagnosis  and testing as 
targeted case managers; this ended a few years ago. Head Start staff 
still perform the EPS DT for all students, but are not reimbursed any 
more. Case managers working with our families could do the  same , we 
know the model works w ith Medicaid Managed Care and should work  
just as well wi th MaineCare and Primary Care  Plus. 
 
We also know that having  regular contact with individuals and families  
can lead  to better health and well -being outcomes; our case managers 
also attend to the social determinants of health: ensuring our customers 
have a safe and affordable place to l ive; adequate food for the family; 
attend work and school  regularly; and more.  
 The model I propose goes further than the bil l you have before you, but 
it is well wor th consideration. By using a value based, widely 
appreciated system of care, we can  improve lives and sav e mon ey. 
 
Thank you for your time and attention.
