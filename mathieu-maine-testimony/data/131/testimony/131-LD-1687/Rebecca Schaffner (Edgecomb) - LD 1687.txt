LD 1687
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Committee: I am Becky 
Schaffner, from Edgecomb, and I am writing to support LD1687 for several reasons. I
am a GIS Coordinator in the Water Bureau of the Department of Environmental 
Protection (DEP), and in this position I assist multiple water monitoring, research, and
protection programs. For each one of them, I need the best available and most current 
data and imagery available to create the maps and data analysis used by DEP staff. It 
is critical for my work, but more importantly, to almost every state agency and 
municipality, to establish stable, permanent funding for imagery acquisition and 
processing. 
I also frequently require technical assistance from, and use data layers created by the 
hardworking and busy staff of the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems. 
They face the same staffing challenges as most of the rest of the state, and are greatly 
in need of the additional support and expertise that would come from funding the two 
additional positions in MEGIS. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Respectfully,
Becky Schaffner
