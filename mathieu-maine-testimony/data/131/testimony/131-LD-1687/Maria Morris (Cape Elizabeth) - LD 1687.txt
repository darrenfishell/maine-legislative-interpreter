LD 1687
To our Representatives, 
I am writing to express my support for LD 1687. Maine's resources are the foundation
of our communities - economically, culturally, spiritually. Geographic Information 
enables us to manage our resources and plan for the future. As often as possible, we 
should pursue best practices and updated technologies to further our capabilities. 
Thank you
