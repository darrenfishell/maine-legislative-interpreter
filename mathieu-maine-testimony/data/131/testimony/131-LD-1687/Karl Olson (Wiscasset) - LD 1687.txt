I am a land surveyor. I not only survey property boundaries but assist in land 
development thru the preparation of subdivision & site plans. At least weekly, if not 
daily, I access geospatial data acquired by the state as part of my work.
I also serve on my local planning board. I frequently access State geospatial data 
when projects are proposed to us.
The data collected by the State is of great benefit to me, my clients, and 
municipalities.
A continuous & stable funding plan is a great benefit to all.
