Testimony of William Smith in support of LD 1687 "An Act to Improve Geographic 
Information System Data Acquisition and Maintenance"
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and members of the State and Local 
Government Committee. My name is William Smith, and I am a Software Engineer 
with over 20 years experience in data communications and control systems. Thank 
you for the opportunity to present support of LD 1687. 
To make this simple I have read the testimony of Leticia vanVuuren, Geospatial 
Database Manager for the Knox County Emergency Management Agency, and would
offer my agreement with it in full. I specifically agree the hiring of a systems analyst 
to support the system is money well spent.
I would offer that your work session could discuss the addition to the bill of further 
research intended to determine potential ways to monetize the dataset for use by the 
private sector. 
Thank you.
