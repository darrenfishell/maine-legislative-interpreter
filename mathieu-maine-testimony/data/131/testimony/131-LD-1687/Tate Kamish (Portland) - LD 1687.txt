I work for Ballotpedia, an online encyclopedia of U.S. elections and politics, where 
part of my role is to maintain the spatial data in our database to support our Sample 
Ballot Lookup tool, which allows people to preview who and what will be on their 
ballots in upcoming elections. A huge part of being able to provide this service to 
people is the availability of GIS boundary data via open data portals such as the 
Maine GeoLibrary.
This is just one example of the GeoLibrary's value, but this resource is important 
across a variety of sectors including but not limited to environmental protection, city 
planning, and business development.
