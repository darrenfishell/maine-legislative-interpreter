RE: Written Testimony related to LD 1687; 
An Act to Improve Geographic Information System 
Data Acquisition and Maintenance
To the Committee on State & Local Government of the 131st Maine State Legislature:
Dear Ms. Stover, Mr. Nangle and the Members of the Committee,
 
This testimony is in favor of LD 1687 and to applaud the efforts of its presenter, Ms. Grohoski, all of 
its cosponsors, and every one of those legislators that have openly endorsed it.
Maine’s GeoLibrary needs more than backstop funding measures, which thankfully LD 1687 provides, 
because so many of Maine’s vital services are dependent on up-to-date spatial information. The 
GeoLibrary needs to be recognized as the Apex Data Provider and Steward  of our spatial data; the data
upon which E911, Fire, Police and EMT services rely on daily. 
Beyond the daily needs for indispensable accurate and timely spatial information, looms an ever 
increasing need as rapid changes to our climate require informed decision making in the new paradigm 
of hydrology in civil engineering, to name just one facet of engineering, health and bio-related systems 
dealing with these environmental shifts.
A unanimous ought-to-pass for LD 1687, will be very much appreciated indeed, but please continue to 
think about long term funding solutions for the GeoLibrary.
As a professional land surveyor and Hancock County resident, consumer, and producer of spatial data 
for more than 35 years, I thank you so very much for your help!
Kind regards,
