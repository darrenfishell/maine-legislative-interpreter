Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1203:
“An
Act
to
Clarify
Deadlines
in
the
Freedom
of
Access
Act
and
Disclosure
Provisions
in
the
Intelligence
and
Investigative
Record
Information
Act”
Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1203.
The
last
review
of
state
freedom
of
access
laws
by
the
National
Freedom
of
Information
Coalition
(NFOIC)
in
2017
gave
Maine
just
6.5
points
out
of
16
total
possible
points:
an
“F”
grade.
1
Maine’s
law
has
changed
very
little
since
then.
2
We
are
pleased
to
see
that
commonsense
Freedom
of
Access
Act
(FOAA)
reform
has
bipartisan
support
in
this
legislature.
The
problems
in
Maine’s
law
are
apparent
to
journalists
and
observers
across
the
political
spectrum,
and
in
our
experience,
have
only
gotten
worse
in
the
last
four
years.
In
Maine
Policy
Institute’s
20-plus
years
of
experience
submitting
FOAA
requests,
state
compliance
has
never
been
as
poor
as
it
is
today.
Rarely
did
we
struggle
to
get
information
from
the
government
under
the
Baldacci
or
LePage
administrations.
It
almost
seems
as
if
government
offices
have
been
instructed
by
Gov.
Mills
to
slow-walk
the
process
and
price
certain
requestors
out
of
the
information
they
seek.
In
the
last
few
years,
the
FOAA
process
has
been
unnavigable.
Routine
requests
that
should
take
a
matter
of
weeks
instead
take
several
months
or
more.
The
cost
estimates
have
spiraled
out
of
control.
The
law
has
no
teeth.
Our
FOAA
law,
as
it
stands
today,
makes
it
far
too
easy
for
bureaucrats
to
obfuscate
their
communications
and
activities.
It
empowers
the
government
to
sit
on
state
secrets
–
not
citizens
to
uncover
them
–
and
is
in
desperate
need
of
immediate
reform.
3
The
30-day
limitation
proposed
in
this
bill
is
only
for
the
delivery
of
a
time
and
cost
estimate
of
each
request
–
it
is
still
nonbinding.
Of
all
the
issues
with
FOAA,
LD

1203
offers
a
small
change,
but
one
that
is
basic
to
ensure
some
level
of
public
access.
This
committee
will
likely
face
far
more
ambitious
proposals
this
session;
these
should
also
be
given
serious
consideration.
Please
deem
LD
1203
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
provide
just
a
little
more
government
accountability
to
the
people
and
their
right
to
know.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
