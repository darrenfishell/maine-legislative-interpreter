In Opposition to  
LD 1203 -  An Act to Clarify Deadlines in the Freedom of Access Act and Disclosure Provisions in the 
Intelligence and Investigative Record Information Act  
April 3, 2023  
_________________________________________________________________________________ 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, 
and I am providing testimony in opposition to LD 1203 on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s 
(MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction 
to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Following current laws as  it exists  is extremely important to local leaders across Maine, including 
providing citizens with access to public records and doing so in a timely manner. The part of this proposed bill that specifies a time frame of no later than 30 days in which an age ncy is to respond to the requestor 
with a good -faith, nonbinding estimate of the time frame and costs associated with complying with the 
request does not cause officials as much concern as section two and three , since requests/estimates are 
typically respo nded to within the specified time frame.  
Section two of the proposed bill allows the entity to prioritize the requests giving preference to 
Maine residents, or journalists acting in their professional capacity with the intention of providing information to  the public. This portion of the bill causes concern among municipal officials where requests 
are fulfilled in the order they are received and do not typically have issues fulfilling requests in an 
appropriate time frame.  
Municipal officials are also conc erned with section three of the proposal as it may constitute an 
unwarranted invasion of privacy. While individual consent does not cause heartburn among officials, allowing family members to allow the invasion of privacy for incapacitated or deceased individuals and 
minors, could have unintended consequences when taking into consideration the variety of family styles, 
dynamics and choices available.  
For these reasons the LPC is opposed to LD 1203. Thank  you for your time and for considering th e 
municipal perspective on this issue.
