TESTIMONY IN OPPOSIT ION TO  
 
L.D. 1203  
 
AN ACT TO CLARIFY DE ADLINES IN THE FREEDOM OF ACCESS  
ACT AND DISCLOSURE P ROVISIONS IN THE INTELLIGENCE AND  
INVESTIGATIVE RECORD INFORMATION ACT  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Committee on Judici-
ary. I am Victoria Wallack, communications and government relations director for 
the Maine School Management Association testifying on behalf of the legislative 
committee of the Maine School Superintendents Association in opposition to L.D. 
1203.  
 
This bill says that a good faith estimate of time on how long it will take an entity to 
comply with a freedom of access request can take no longer than 30 days.  
 
Superintendents are opposed to this bill because of the relatively recent history of re-
ceiving requests that are so expansive in some districts extra staff or staff hours have 
been added to comply.  
 
As an example, the Gorham School District was hit with 34 freedom of information 
requests that focused on the school ’s support for its students who identified as gay or 
bisexual and a demand that books be removed from the school library and posters be 
taken down that encouraged acceptance. A similar freedom of access request was 
made to the Hermon School District that resulted in a lawsuit against the district.
