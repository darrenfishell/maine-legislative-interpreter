Re: LD 1203 – An Act to Clarify  Deadlines  in the Freedom  of Access  Act and Disclosure  
Provisions  in the Intelligence  and Investigative  Record  Information  Act 
 
Position: Neither For Nor Against 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is neither for nor against LD 1203 and we thank 
you for the opportunity to outline our points for your Committee. 
 
Members were in support of the language to specify that the reasonable time for an agency 
to provide a good faith estimate of the time and cost be established to be no longer than 30 
days following the receipt of the request.  Although there were some concerns stated that 
there are instances where it may be difficult to meet this requirement for certain complex 
requests, members still felt it was reasonable. 
 
Since the section regarding the prioritization of requests is not mandatory, members were 
not overly concerned by this language addition but most felt that it was not necessary since 
requests are generally processed on a first-come, first-served basis.  Focusing on a complex 
request simply because it is from a journalist may delay responses to other requests. 
 
Many questions were raised regarding the consented release of a record which would 
constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy and how these disclosure consents would be 
administered, if passed. 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association appreciates the opportunity to share its  
testimony with the Committee. Should any questions arise, please feel free to contact  me at 
207)680-4210 or by email: pdubois@waterville-me.gov  .
