The Maine Prescription Drug Board (MPDAB) identified the new Medicare maximum fair prices 
”as an opportunity for Maine to leverage the work ofthe federal government," and 
recommended Maine adopt maximum fair prices as reference rates to set upper payment limits 
for selected drugs sold in Maine 8 LD 1816 and Ll) 1829 implement this MPDAB 
recommendation and ensure that Mainers who are not enrolled in Medicare will still be able to 
beneﬁt from the maximum fair prices for selected drugs negotiated for Medicare It is worth 
noting that, due to the limited number of drugs that will be selected for negotiation for 
Medicare, the MPDAB also recommends that Maine ”institute Medicare reference rates 
supplemented by Canadian reference rates where domestic MFPs are not available, to 
maximize savings "9 Due to the large number of drugs that have price tags too high for Mainers 
to afford, CAHC also supports using Canadian reference rates to supplement Medicare-based 
reference rates, when a Medicare MFP IS not available for a drug 
While we may not know the exact amount of savings that are likely to result from implementing 
Medicare reference- based pricing for negotiated drugs, since CMS has not released the ﬁrst list 
of selected drugs or the negotiated prices for those drugs yet, we expect savings in Maine 
would be substantial, based on the estimated savings from IRA drug negotiation provisions, 
which are expected to save Medicare $98 5 billion over ten years 1°
I
l 
Under these bills, participating plans must submit a report to the Superintendent of Insurance 
indicating how much they saved by utilizing Medicare reference rates and how they passed 
those savings on to consumers Self-insured plans that elect to opt-in to the program must also 
accept these terms as conditions for their voluntary participation In determining how to utilize 
savings, purchasers are required to consider measures that will promote health equity by 
addressing disparities across communities 11 To ensure the savings from reference rates are 
used in a manner that maximizes beneﬁts to consumers, we respectfully suggest the 
Committee consider adding a process for the Bureau bf Insurance to solicit stakeholder 
feedback on how carriers utilize savings, including arly initiatives aimed at addressing health 
disparities across communities This will further ensure that savings are passed on to 
consumers in ways that meaningfully improve prescription drug affordability for individuals, as 
well as promote health equity in our stateK 
Opponents to this bill may argue that allowing Mamers to access Medicare negotiated prices 
will stifle innovation or significantly reduce Maine people's access to new medicines However, 
we believe these claims are a gross exaggeration levied to scare off policymakers from any 
attempt to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for charging unaffordable and 
unjustifiably high prices for prescription drugs The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO) estimated that all of the IRA drug pricing provisions, including but not limited to 
negotiated prices for select Medicare drugs, will have a minimal impact on the development

and ava||ab|||ty of new drugs In the U S , estlmatmg a mere 1% reductlon |n the number of new 
drugs that Wlll hlt the U S market over the next 30 years 12 And, agam, th|s IS the cumulatlve 
|mpact of several dnfferent prescrlptlon drug pr|c|ng provlsnons lmplemented at the federal 
level Thus makes It very d|ff|cult to |mag|ne how extendmg th|s one provlslon to more people |n 
Mame could have any meanlngful Impact on access to med|c|nes |n Mame, that |s other than 
makmg select prescrlptlon drugs more affordable 
No Ma|ner should go w|thout the medlcatlon they need due to cost/ s lt |s clear that Mame 
people, as well as the State of Mame, would greatly beneﬁt from ut|l|z|ng the Medlcare ‘ 
negotnated pnces for selected prescr|pt|on drugs For these reasons, I strongly urge you toN 
support LD 1816 and LD 1829 Thank you and I'd be happy to answer any questuons
