Re L D 1816, An Act Requiring Reference-based Pricing to Reduce Prescription 
Drug Costs 
L D 1829, An Act to Reduce Prescription Drug Costs by Requiring Reference- 
based Pricing 
Dear Senator Bailey and Representative Perry 
I write on behalf of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America 
(“PhRMA") in opposition to L D 1816, An Act Requiring Reference-based Pricing to 
Reduce Prescription Drug Costs, and L D 1829, An Act to Reduce Prescription Drug 
Costs by Requiring Reference-based Pricing (together, the “Legislation") 
I am a litigation partner at Pierce Atwood, where I co-chair Pierce Atwood's 
appellate litigation practice and specialize in complex commercial litigation, 
administrative law, and constitutional litigation In connection with my work,I 
have argued numerous constitutional questions before the Law Court, the United 
States District Court, and the United States Court of Appeals, including cases where 
my clients have prevailed in striking down Maine state statutes as unconstitutional 
I am admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court and have 
authored and submitted amicus briefs to the Court in connection with matters of 
constitutional law Prior to entering the private practice of law, I served as a law 
clerk on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 
Having reviewed the legislation and applicable law, the Legislation presents 
numerous constitutional concerns, including but not limited to 
First, the Legislation prohibits a drug manufacturer from withdrawing its drugs 
from the Maine market to avoid the fines set forth in the Legislation for selling 
drugs above the so-called reference price and, thus, compels drug manufacturers to

continue supplying drugs into Maine when they do not wish to do so Because no 
manufacturers of medications intended for human use are in Maine, the 
Legislation ’s requirement that out-of-state drug manufacturers introduce drugs into 
the state regulates only out-of-state actors This extraterritorial effect of the 
Legislation violates the United States Constitution's prohibition on a state regulating 
conduct that occurs wholly outside of its borders The Supreme Court, in Healyv 
Beer Institute, Inc , made this principle clear, holding that the Commerce Clause of 
the Constitution “precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that 
takes place wholly outside of the State's borders " 491 U S 324, 336 (1989). The 
common sense underlying this doctrine can be illustrated with a simple example 
How would this Legislature react if Massachusetts passed a statute regulating the 
prices at which the Maine lobster industry sold lobsters in Massachusetts? Courts 
have applied principles of extraterritoriality to strike down state legislation that 
sought to regulate increases in prescription drug prices For instance, in Association 
for Accessible Medicines v Frosh, 887 F 3d 664 (4th Cir 2018), the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit struck down a Maryland statute that sought 
to prohibit “unconsci0nable" prescription drug price increases on the grounds that 
the statute regulated economic activity that occurred wholly outside the state The 
Legislation violates the Constitution in the same way in its efforts to regulate out- 
of-state transactions and compel out-of-state drug manufacturers to continue 
supplying prescription drugs to Maine against their wishes 
Second, the Legislation violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States 
Constitution, found in Article VI, clause 2, which states that laws made by the 
United States Congress “shall be the supreme Law of the Land " The Supremacy 
Clause has given rise to the doctrine of preemption, under which a court must 
strike down a state law that impermissibly conflicts with or stands as an obstacle to 
federal law Here, the Legislation impermissibly conflicts with United States patent 
laws with respect to its efforts to regulate the prices drug manufacturers may 
charge with respect to drugs that remain subject to patent protection United 
States patent law grants patent recipients the “right to exclude” others from the 
making, using, or selling the patented invention for a limited period See 35 US 
§ 154(d) (rights of patent holders) Patent law thus permits the patent recipient to 
operate in the marketplace without competition before the patent protection ends 
and others may freely disseminate the invented product This approach balances 
the societal interest in incentivizing the creativity of inventors with the competing 
interest in seeing new inventions widely exploited State laws that disrupt this 
delicate balance by limiting the economic benefits associated with patent protection 
conflict with United States patent laws and thus are preempted by the Supremacy 
Clause Courts have adopted this reasoning when striking down local laws imposing 
price controls or otherwise limit pharmaceutical prices For instance, after the 
District of Columbia passed legislation that would have made it unlawful to sell 
prescription drugs in the District “for an excessive price," the Court of Appeals for

the Federal Circuit invalidated the law because it improperly sought to “re-balance 
the statutory framework of rewards and incentives insofar as it relates to inventive 
new drugs " See Biotechnology Indus Org v D/strict of Columbia, 496 F 3d 1362, 
1364 (Fed Cir 2007) The Legislation violates the Supremacy Clause in the same 
way, as, with respect to patented medications, it seeks to limit the economic 
benefits associated with the patent rights of pharmaceutical manufacturers 
Third, the Legislation raises additional preemption issues related to the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), a federal statute that sets certain 
requirements for retirement plans in private industry ERISA preempts a state that 
may “relate to” a private benefit plan See 29 U S C § 1144(a) The Supreme 
Court, in analyzing whether a state law IS preempted by ERISA, looks to whether 
the law “has a connection with or reference to such a plan ” Egelhoffv Egelhoff, 
532 U S 141, 147 (2001) The result of this analysis is that ERISA preempts any 
state law that “regulates a key facet of plan administration " Gobe/lle v Liberty 
Mut Ins Co , 136 S Ct 936 (Thomas, J , concurring) 
The Legislation includes an ERISA Plan opt-in provision which allows an ERISA Plan 
to opt-in to the Legislation by notifying the Superintendent of Insurance Sucha 
provision, which would allow state law to affect the price ERISA plans are able to 
charge for prescription drugs, would certainly “relate” to a state health plan, and 
thus be preempted by ERISA While a voluntary opt-in may have less of an effect 
on private plans, it IS nevertheless a state law regulating a “key facet” of the plan- 
namely, the price of prescription drugs The effects of even voluntary regulation of 
such a critical component of plan administration could have unforeseen 
consequences and effects not considered by Congress when it devised ERISA, which 
in turn could threaten the stability and efficacy of private plans For example, the 
Legislation does not provide any means for a private health plan to opt-out of the 
pricing scheme once it has consented, although the inclusion of an opt-out 
provision would not be sufficient to remedy the foregoing Supremacy Clause flaws 
in the Legislation A regulatory scheme that would dramatically alter the 
administration of a private plan and that lacks an opt-out provision in case that 
regulation threatened to undermine plan administrator's ability to provide effective 
coverage to employees undermines Congress's intent for ERISA to supersede state 
law Notably, ERISA does not set a ‘floor’ for state regulation of private plans, but 
instead prohibits regulation concerning private plans entirely The Legislation 
attempts to do Just that, and thus is preempted by ERISA 
Finally, Governor Mills cited the same “potential Constitutional claims" when she 
vetoed pharmaceutical price cap legislation in the 130"‘ Legislature See Veto 
Letter to the 130"‘ Legislature, June 29, 2021 Like the Legislation, then-L D 675 
sought to limit pricing changes on certain drugs and sought to prohibit out-of—state 
manufacturers from withdrawing drugs from the Maine market The Governor

concluded that L D 675 was “vulnerable to a challenge based on the dormant 
Commerce Clause" because of Its extraterrltorlal effect, c|t|ng the Supreme Court's 
C|eClSl0l'1 ll'l Healy v Beer Institute, dlscussed above See id The Governor furl:her 
clted the Federal C|rcu|t's declslon |n Biotechnology Indus Org v District of 
Columbia, also dlscussed above, |n support of her vlew that L D 675 was 
“vulnerable to cla|ms related to patent preemptlon " See id The Leglslatlon 
presents the preclsely same constltutlonal defects on whlch the Governor relled to 
veto s|m|lar b|lls |n the past 
For the foregoing reasons, PhRMA respectfully urges the Commlttee to vote Ought 
Not to Pass w|th respect to L D 1816 and L D 1829 Thank you for your attentlon
