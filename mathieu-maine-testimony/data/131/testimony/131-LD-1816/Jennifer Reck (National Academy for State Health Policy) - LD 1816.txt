NASHP NATIONAL ACADEMY 
FOR STATE HEALTH POLICY 
Testimony of the National Academy for State Health Policy Regarding 
& LD 1829 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Affairs Committee, 
My name IS Jennifer Reck and I am the Director of the Center for Drug Pricing at the National 
Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP) NASHP is a non-partisan forum of state policy makers 
that works to develop and promote innovative health care pollcy solutions at the state level In 
2017 NASHP created its Center for Drug Pricing to focus attention on steps that states can take 
to tackle the spiraling costs of prescription drugs and the impact they have on consumers, the 
overall cost of health care and state budgets 
At NASHP we believe that when it comes to health care, the states are a tremendous source of 
innovative ideas and solutlons We approach our work by engaging and convening state leaders 
to solve problems We conduct policy analysis and research and we provide technical assistance 
to states NASHP's Center for Drug Pricing develops model legislation for states and provides 
technical assistance and support to legislators and executive branch leaders who wish to move 
them forward When these bills pass, NASHP continues to support states as they are 
implemented 
NASHP is a non-partisan organization We recognize state policy reflects the unique situations 
in each state however, so we do not take positions on legislative proposals I am here not ”for" 
or "against" the bill, but to share information and to help answer questions 
In November 2022 NASHP released model legislation to use the Medicare Fair Price (MFP) as 
an upper payment limit (UPL). Two bill before the Committee today, LD 1816 and LD 1829, 
contain many of the same elements of the NASHP model. 
These bills direct the state to leverage critical drug pricing provisions in the landmark Inflation 
Reduction Act (IRA) The IRA contains several provisions designed to help reduce the costsof
prescrIptIon drugs, IncludIng prov|s|ons that w|ll allow Med|care for the ﬁrst tIme to negotIate 
the cost of several hIgh-cost drugs The prIce negotIatIon process w|ll begIn 2023 and Med|care 
wIll publIsh Its negotIated prIce for the ﬁrst ten drugs by September 1, 2024 Although the lIst of 
drugs that wIll be subject to negotIated prlces Is not yet known, the lIst wIll Include drugs that 
are costly to prrvate health Insurance plans and state purchasers Analysts suggest the lIst may 
Include drugs lIke the costly antIacogulants ElIquIs and Xarelto Both of these drugs appear on 
the MaIne Health Data OrganIzatIon's current lIst of the costlIest drugs In MaIne 
These bIlls d|rect the state to use the Med|care negotIated prIce as the UPL for drugs sold In the 
state ThIs means that the payment lImIts set by Med|care w|ll apply to prIvate and publIc 
purchasers IncludIng ERISA plans that choose to partIcIpate 
A state process that sets a UPL, baslcally a ceIlIng payment rate, Is not prIce-settIng 
Manufacturers are free to set whatever prIce they chose A UPL caps what a purchaser w|ll pay 
DetermInIng maxImum payment levels or payment rates for health care and other publIc goods 
IS a state practIce that has exIsted for decades States regulate Insurers and other publIc goods 
and servIces In markets w|th lIttle or no market competItIon and set payment rates for health 
servIces through theIr publIc purchasIng These bIlls extend that precedent to prescrIptIon drugs 
by usIng Med|care's negotIated rate as reference poInts to set faIr payment rates 
The process for selectmg drugs and negotIatIng prIces Is descrIbed In detaIl In the |nflatIon 
ReductIon Act The federal Department of Health and Human Servlces (HHS) wIll comp|le a lIst 
of drugs that m-eet the crIterIa descrIbed In the statute NegotIatIons are lImIted to sIngle- 
source drugs that (1) are at least 7 years (small molecule) or 11 years (bIologIc) beyond FDA 
approval, and (2) account for at least $200 mIllIon spend across Med|care Parts B and D The 
IRA excludes from negotIatIon drugs marketed as generIc/bIosImIlar (or b|olog|cs w|th reference 
bIosImIlar pendIng entrance wIthIn 2 years), orphan drugs that treat a sIngle rare d|sease, and 
plasma products From those drugs, HHS selects the top 10 drugs In order of hlghest to lowest 
spendIng 
HHS w|ll then revIew Informatlon submItted from the manufacturer and determlne a MaxImum 
FaIr PrIce Manufacturers can accept or propose a counteroffer HHS then publIshes the ﬁnal 
MaxImum FaIr PrIce (MFP), whIch IS bIndIn_g 
It Is not currently possIble to determIne the savIngs that MaIne or other IndIvIdual states would 
realIze If they referenced the MFP because neIther the drugs nor the prIces have yet been 
determIned However, the savIngs estImated by Med|care are sIgnIfIcant (estImated at $985 
bIllIon over ten years) and would undoubtedly translate Into large savIngs at the state 
level DependIng on how long a drug has been on the market, the IRA ceIlIng prIce w|ll be 
capped at 40% to 70% of average manufacturer prIce 
The UPL applIes to all purchasers In the state, IncludIng commercIal Insurers, state entItIes and 
ERISA plans that elect to partIcIpate These bIlls, lIke the NASHP model, requIres purchasers to 
utIlIze savIngs to reduce costs for theIr members Purchasers (Includmg partIcIpatIng ERISA

plans) must subm|t a report to the Insurance Department |nd|cat|ng how much they saved by 
part|c|pat|ng and how they passed those savmgs on to consumers and how those sav|ngs 
helped to reduce cost d|spar|t|es
