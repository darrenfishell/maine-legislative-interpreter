Mame people Our m1ss1on as an assoc1at1on 1s to 1mprove the health of Marne people by 
promotlng affordable, safe, and coord1nated healthcare 
The excess1ve cost of prescr1pt1on drugs 1s one of the key contnbutors to 1nﬂat1on 1n health care 
and one of the b1ggest challenges 1nsurance carrrers face when try1ng to keep prem1ums 
affordable We understand the Ob_]6Ct1V € of LDs 1816 and 1829, and our assocratlon supports 
efforts to control the r1s1ng costs of prescrlptron drugs 
We oppose penal1z1ng earners for the mrsconduct of drug manufacturers not makrng prescr1pt1on 
drugs on the target 11st avarlable 1n Ma1ne at reference-based prlces 
The Marne Health Data Organ1zat1on reports am1ually on prescr1pt1on drug costs and ut1l1zat1on 
1n Mame at retall and marl-order pharmac1es The report for the year endrng June 30, 2022, tells 
us that prescr1pt1on drug spendrng lncreased by 6 6% desplte a 1 8% decrease 1n the number of 
prescr1pt1ons ﬁlled 
The $2 762 b1ll1on we spent on prescr1pt1ons last year amounts to $2,000 for every Malner1 
The ob] ect1ve of LDs 1816 and 1829 1s to achreve par1ty between the costs pa1d for some

Our concern w1th L D s 1816 and 1829 1s that both b1lls seek to pun1sh health lnsurance plans for 
the actlons of drug manufacturers These b111s place the burden and the pun1shment on earners 
for paylng more than the reference prlce w1thout restrlctmg the ab1l1ty of a drug manufacturer to 
charge more than the reference p1‘lC6 If the leg1s1ature 1s mterested 1n regulatrng the pnce of 
p1‘6SC1‘lp1I1011 drugs, 1t should regulate the amount charged, not the amount pald, and pumsh drug 
manufacturers that charge more than that amount
