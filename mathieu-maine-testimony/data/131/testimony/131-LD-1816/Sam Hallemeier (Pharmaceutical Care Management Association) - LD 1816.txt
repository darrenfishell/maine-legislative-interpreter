RE LD 1816 & LD 1829, An Act Requiring Reference-based Pricing to Reduce 
Prescription Drug Costs, Opposed 
Chair Bailey, Chair Perry, Members of the Committee, 
I am Sam Hallemeier, Director of State Affairs, writing on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Care 
Management Association (PCMA) to oppose LD 1816 and LD 1829 PCMA is the national 
association representing America’s pharmacy beneﬁt managers (PBMs) PBMs administer 
prescription drug plans and operate mail-order and specialty pharmacies for more than 275 
million Americans with health coverage through large employers, health insurers, labor unions, 
and federal and state-sponsored health programs 
PBMs exist to make drug coverage more affordable by aggregating the buying power of millions 
of enrollees through their plan sponsor/payer clients PBMs help consumers obtain lower prices 
for prescription drugs through price discounts from retail pharmacies, rebates from 
pharmaceutical manufacturers, and using lower-cost dispensing channels Though employers, 
health plans, and public programs are not required to use PBMs, most choose to because 
PBMs help lower the costs of prescription drug coverage 
PCMA appreciates the leg|slat|on ’s intent to decrease healthcare costs for patients, however, 
we believe LD 1816 and LD 1829 may penalize those entities that work daily to improve patient 
care and lower drug costs rather than curb anticompetitive pricing practices of manufacturers 
This bill would require purchasers not to purchase or seek reimbursement for more than the 
maximum fair price, whether directly or through a distributor If payment for individual 
transactions of a reference drug exceeds the referenced rate, payers are SUbj6C1I to a ﬁne of 
$1,000 for each individual transaction PBMs do not set the list price of a drug, that lies solely on 
the manufacturers While the bill has provisions to bring enforcement against manufacturers 
that pull from the market, there is no penalty for just keeping the price high PCMA requests that 
you strike section 2 of the bill since it fines the entities who have no control over the cost ofa 
drug
