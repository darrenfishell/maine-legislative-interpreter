RE:   LD 1816 and LD 1829  
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services:  
This memo is to request that the committee  consider adding language to the bill (s) specific to 
reducing prescription drug costs by requiring refence based pricing, LD 1816,  and LD 1829, that 
would repeal the  requirements in Title 22, Chapter 1683 Subchapter 4 .  
INTERNATIONAL 
REFERENCED RATE PRICING FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS .    As you know MHDO published its first 
annual report on International Referenced Rate Pricing for Prescription Drugs , as required in 
Subchapter 4 . The full report  can be found here:  
https://mhdo.maine.gov/RxReferenceRates.htm    
The definition of the prescription drug  “reference d rate” or the “maximum fair price “described  
in the bills before the committee  is the maximum rate for a prescription drug published by the 
Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to United States Public Law 117 -169, Section 1195 (2022) , and does not include prescription drug pricing 
in Canada .    Repealing S ubchapter 4 would eliminate the costs associated with producing an 
annual report that does not support the policy direction as defined in these bills.    
I welcome the opportunity to discuss this request with the committee during the work session.  
I thank the committee in advance for your consideration.
