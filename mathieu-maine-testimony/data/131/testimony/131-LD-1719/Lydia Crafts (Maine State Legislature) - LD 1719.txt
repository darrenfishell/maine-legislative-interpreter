Testimony of Rep Lydia Crafts supportmg 
LD 1719, An Act to Establish Substance Use Disorder Treatment Centers 
Before the Joint Standmg Committee on Health and Human Services 
Good Afternoon Senator Baldacc1, Representanve Meyer and d1st1ngu1shed members of the J o1nt 
Standmg Commlttee on Health and Human Serv1ces I am Representatlve Lydla Crafts and 
proudly serve House D1stnct 46 I am here to test1fy 1n support of LD 1719, An Act to Establzsh 
Substance Use Dzsorder Treatment Centers 
Thls cormmttee understands well that one of our greatest barners to suppomng Ma1ners w1th 
Substance Use Dlsorder (SUD) 1s accessmg adequate treatment serv1ces We frequently d1scuss 
the lack of ‘beds’ 1n our state, but 1t 1s more complex than only havmg the nght number of beds 
Our response to SUD for dnlgs and alcohol must also be accesslble 
We have many countles 1n Mame wrthout adequate treatment serv1ces LD 1719 offers us the 
opportumty to estabhsh two new fac1l1t1es that wrll oifer hope, the chance at recovery, and 
hfe-savmg treatment 1n commumues w1th great need 
When someone seeks treatment, 1t 1s often 1n cr1s1s and they have an 1mmed1ate need Ensunng 
our ab1l1ty to help someone connect w1th approprlate serv1ces 1n a tlmely manner and 1na 
locatron that does not remove them from the1r supports, loved ones, and current serv1ces W111 
allow us to make a hfe-savmg d1fference 1n the lives of Mamers 
I know the desperat1on of searchrng for a bed when a farmly member reaches out ask1ng for help 
w1th therr SUD In those moments, a person’s readmess 1s palpable, but 1t 1s closely pa1red wlth 
great vu1nerab1hty Sendmg a fnend or fam1ly member across county borders, let alone state 
]1nes, tears them away from the very foundat1on of love, support and care they need 
Please support LD 1719 as an lmportant step toward a comprehens1ve pubhc health response to 
the devastatmg effects of Substance Use Drsorder I am happy to take any questrons
