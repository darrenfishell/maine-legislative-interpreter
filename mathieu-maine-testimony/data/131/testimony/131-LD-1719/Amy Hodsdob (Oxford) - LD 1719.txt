There are not enough SUT beds in the State of Maine.  We have clients seeking help 
at our office every day and we have to turn them away because our waiting lists are 
too long and there are not beds available for them to detox and get immediate 
treatment. Maine is very far behind other states in the amount of beds available to 
combat the opioid epidemic.
