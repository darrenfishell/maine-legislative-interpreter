  POSITION STATEMENT NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST 
 
LD 1719: 
 An 
Act 
to 
Establish 
 Substance 
 Use 
 Disorder 
 Treatment 
 Centers  
 
Presented to Maine’s Joint Standing Committee on HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
 
As the state’s largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization, NAMI Maine stands 
neither for nor against LD 1719: 
 An 
Act 
to 
Establish 
 Substance 
 Use 
 Disorder 
 Treatment 
 Centers. 
We 
strongly 
 and 
 enthusiastically 
 support 
 the 
development 
 of 
more 
 options 
 supporting 
 people 
 to 
address 
 their 
 substance 
 use 
needs 
 and 
 break 
 the 
cycle 
 of 
addiction 
 in 
their 
 lives 
 but 
recognize 
that 
 substance 
 use 
without 
 an 
underlying 
 mental 
 health 
 need 
 is 
rarely 
 the 
case. 
 For 
several 
decades 
 we 
have 
 acknowledged 
 that 
 mental 
 health 
 needs 
 and 
 a 
substance 
 use 
disorder 
 go 
hand 
in 
hand.  
 We 
have 
 called 
 them 
 co-occurring 
 conditions 
 and 
 framed 
 it 
as 
dual 
 diagnosis; 
 we 
have 
acknowledged 
 the 
need 
 for 
wholistic 
 treatment 
 that 
 addresses 
 the 
whole 
 person. 
 Research 
indicates 
 that 
 43% 
 of 
people 
 in 
substance 
 use 
treatment 
 for 
non-medical 
 use 
of 
opioid 
 pain 
killers 
 have 
 a 
diagnosis 
 or 
symptom 
 of 
a 
mental 
 health 
 condition, 
 particularly 
 depression 
 or 
anxiety. 
 The 
 incidence 
 is 
even 
 higher 
 for 
adolescents 
 in 
substance 
 use 
treatment. 
 Yet 
once 
 again 
we 
are 
establishing 
 programs 
 to 
support 
 a 
person 
 with 
 an 
acknowledged 
 substance 
 use 
disorder 
without 
 integrating 
 co-occurring 
 treatment 
 of 
mental 
 health 
 needs.  
 
Over 
 many 
 years 
 and 
 through 
 the 
stories 
 of 
countless 
 Maine 
 citizens, 
 NAMI 
 Maine 
 staff 
 have 
heard 
 the 
stories 
 and 
 have 
 acted 
 to 
advocate 
 for 
people 
 denied 
 needed 
 mental 
 health 
 services 
due 
 to 
an 
active 
 substance 
 use 
disorder 
 or 
denied 
 substance 
 use 
treatment 
 because 
 their 
 mental 
health 
 needs 
 were 
 too 
great 
 and 
 not 
in 
control.  
 Which 
 came 
 first, 
 the 
chicken 
 or 
the 
egg? 
 Does 
someone 
 develop 
 a 
substance 
 use 
problem 
 from 
 self-medicating 
 their 
 undiagnosed 
 mental 
health 
 needs, 
 or 
develop 
 a 
mental 
 health 
 disorder 
 because 
 of 
their 
 substance 
 use 
patterns?  
 The 
reality 
 is 
that 
 it 
is 
often 
 both 
 walking 
 the 
path 
 through 
 their 
 loves 
 together.  
 NAMI 
 Maine 
 strongly 
supports 
 programming 
 designed 
 to 
address 
 co-occurring 
 conditions.
