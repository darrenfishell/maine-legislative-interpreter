I truly believe that this bill needs to be passed! Being someone who has suffered with 
substance use disorder and needed to utilize substance use treatment in the past and 
had to go out of state to do so. Thankfully I was blessed enough to have private 
insurance at the time so I was able to utilize facilities out of state. This is not the case 
for many people in maine who suffer from substance use disorder. Many of these 
people seeking treatment have state insurance or no insurance at all. For them to have 
to wait upwards of a week or more to be able to be admitted into a treatment facility 
in Maine is unacceptable and most of the time too late. The window of willingness to 
seek treatment is often short and if not acted on quickly, usually passes before these 
people are able to access treatment. With how things are currently with the opioid 
crisis, this could literally be the difference between life and death for these 
individuals. By adding substance use treatment beds in Maine, more and more 
Mainers who are suffering would be provided the opportunity for help and substantial 
recovery.
