Legislative Testimony in favor of LD 1719 
May 3, 2023 @ 1 PM at the Health and Human Services Committee 
Presented to members of the Health and Human Services Committee 
Hello Chair, members of the Committee and‘ 
members of the public attending,) 
I would like to speak in favor of passage of LD1719, my name IS Tom Doherty, M S W and lam the 
Executive Director of Milestone Recovery in Portland, Maine We operate the Home Team, which ISa 
mobile homeless outreach program serving Portland, a 36 bed men's shelter for intoxicated individuals, a 
16 bed medically managed withdrawal unit and a 21-bed extended care treatment program in Old 
Orchard Beach We also operate some transitional housing for folks leaving our treatment program 
Milestone has been working at the nexus of homelessness and substance use which are issues 
inextricably linked to each other since 1967 Substance use and the way it is treated has changed 
tremendously since '67 and the need for our work and deadlmess of the substances have increased 
markedly The l'Tl3jOl'|'lIy of our clients are Maine Care, Uninsured, and underinsured Clients with private 
insurance represent about 2-3 percent of the people we serve 
ln terms of the need for our work we have seen the number of people screen to get into our Detox go 
from a monthly average of 80 8 in 2014 to 303‘ 91 in 2019 We are consistently turning away 70 percent 
of the people who screen for services This does not include the frustrated people who did not actually 
get through to talk to someone We recently upgraded our phone system and it now allows us to 
quantify calls that were not answered In one 48 hour period last week we noted 92 calls unanswered 
going to our detox unit While some of these could be the same person it likely resent many frustrated 
potential folks entering recovery 
This overtaxed resource is detrimental to getting people into recovery because making the difficult 
decision to take on what could be the most difficult task of your lifetime is fraught with ambivalence and 
can change in an instance The metaphor of the ambulance service seems the most appropriate because 
someone can not and will not wait for services and will likely return to use if they encounter difficulty 
The decision to enter a dangerous, challenging and physically uncomfortable process and leave the 
known world of substance use is and extremely difficult decision 
With that in mind we need to not only meet the overwhelming need are not currently meeting but 
exceed that need to support folks when they make that decision so that they can enter treatment when 
they are ready
