RUMFORD GROUP HOMES - PATH
LD 1719
It has recently come to my attention that the State of Maine has only 28 detox beds in 
the state of Maine. LD 1719 is seeking to add additional beds by creating two new 
treatment centers here in Maine. It has also come to my attention that two of our New 
England neighbors, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, have 300 detox beds each in 
their communities. We need to do better for our community members!! 
I work for Rumford Group Homes and I am the Homeless Services Case Manager for 
the PATH program (Project for Assistance in Transitional from Homelessness for 
Maine HMIS). When working with the homeless population, mental health and 
substance use are key factors to their homelessness. We need to have detox beds to 
offer people who are struggling to get their life on track. It is life or death in our 
communities daily for this population. 
PLEASE PASS LD 1719!!  WE NEED THESE TWO CENTERS and WE NEEDS 
THESE BEDS!!  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION!!
