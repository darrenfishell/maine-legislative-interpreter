Greetlngs Senator Baldaccl, Representatrve Meyer and other honorable members of the Jornt 
Standmg Comtmttee of Health and Human Servlces, My name 1s Steven Knockwood I am the 
Deputy Orgamzmg Drrector for the Mame Recovery Advocacy Pro] ect (ME-RAP) I stand 
before you today to g1ve testlmony m favor of LD 1719 An Act to Estabhsh Substance Use 
Dlsorder Treatment Centers 
Detox 1s often the ﬁrst step 1n someone's recovery process and when S6I‘V1C6S are not readlly 
avarlable w1th1n a reasonable trme frame l1ves are lost, 1nd1v1duals are left feelmg hopeless and 
others affected are left to feel the pam of not bemg able to help an mdrvldual who wants to get 
better We as a soc1ety must do better, we need to expand access to these essentlal servlces These 
servlces need to be ava1lable when an 1nd1v1dua1 1s ready and wlllmg not weeks to months down 
the road 
In my tune workmg 1n the ﬁeld of Indlgenous welhaess and recovery as a Recovery Support 
Speclallst 1t was my task to support 1nd1v1duals mto early recovery servlces I conslstently 
watched as these 1nd1v1duals were demed access to these servrces These 1nd1v1duals wanted to 
get better, wanted to stop the harm they were causmg to the1r farmhes and commumtres only to 
turn away Some of these cases are st1ll actlve 1n the1r drsease behevmg that our soc1ety deems 
them unworthy of asslstance 
A month ago today I stood 1n front of you and spoke about an 1nd1v1dual who wanted to get 
better, but faced the all too often d1lemma of not be1ng able to fmd tlmely placement 1nto Detox 
Th1s lead the mdlvrduals to plan and begln executmg h1s own sLuc1de I ask each and every one 
of you to stop sendmg that message to 1nd1v1duals who are lookmg to recover from SUD 
Often we are told that people wrth substance use dlsorder don’t want help That 1s not my 
experlence. My expenence 1s that help 1s not avallable when they want 1t That 1s why we are 
askmg your commlttee to vote m favor of LD 1719 
Nitap(thank you)
