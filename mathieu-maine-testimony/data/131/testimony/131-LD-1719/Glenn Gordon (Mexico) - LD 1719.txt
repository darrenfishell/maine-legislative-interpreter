Testnmony In Support of ll.1719 
Dear Senator BaldaccI, Representatwe Meyer, and honorable members of the JoInt Health and Human Sen/Ices 
CommIttee, 
My name IS Glenn Gordon and I resIde In Mexlco, ME lam provIdIng testImony In support of LD1719 I am CertIfIed 
Alcohol and Drug Counselor (CADC) and the Overdose Prevent|on Through |ntensIve Outreach Naloxone and Safety 
(OPTIONS) LIaIson for Oxford County 
There are many challenges that make It dIffIcult to address the number of fatal overdoses and the substance use 
epIdemIc In the state of l\/laIne One of the bIggest barrIers to recovery for people Is tImely access to medncally managed 
wIthdrawal servlces (detox) 
There are many challenges wIth accessIng detox and they can be complIcated the choIce of substances that an IndIvIdual 
uses l have transported people to hospital-based detox and they have been dIscharged after short waIt perlods because 
the InItIal wIthdrawal symptoms were determIned not to be severe enough to requIre hospltal admIssIon It can take 
24-48 hours for symptoms to fully develop for someone wIthdrawIng from any substance, In partlcular oplates They are 
dIscharged because theIr symptoms are deemed to be non-lIfe threatenIng Every tIme we release someone seekIng 
treatment Into the commumty where they came from, we put them back Into a lIfe-threatenIng sItuatIon When 
someone self-refers themselves to wIthdraw from any substance, It should be treated as lIfe-threatenmg If someone 
leaves wlthout adequate treatment to return to the only envIronment famIlIar and avaIlable to them and fatally 
overdoses, we are complIcIt In that death 
In Oxford County, I have traveled over 50 mIles at the request of an IndIvIdual seekIng sen/Ices, only to have them 
dIscharged In less than 24 hours on many occasIons from hospItal-based detox settIngs by IndIvIduals who wanted to be 
admItted and were wIllIng to partIcIpate In treatment 
We know that when a person asks for help, that there Is often a narrow wIndow of readIness, wIllIngness and physlcal 
presence It IS Important that we Improve ease and Immedlacy of access to care AvaIlabIlIty and transportatIon are 
huge barrIers An Increased number of facIlItIes, especlally In rural areas lIke Oxford County, wIll save llves by Impr0vIng 
access 
Respectfully
