Dear Senator Baldaccr, Representatrve Meyer, and Members of the HHS 
Commnttee, My name |s Jon Reynolds, l’m a person In recovery and I am here today to 
testrfy In favor of LD 1719 An Act to Establish Substance Use Dlsorder Treatment 
Centers 
As a 32-year-old male who has struggled wrth alcohol use drsorder smce I was 16, LD 
1719 is somethlng very nnportant to me When I started out drmlqng 1t was Just for fun or 
somethmg I d1d wrth frrends on the weekends It qulckly tumed mto a deadly dlsease for me 
though By the t1me I had h1t 20 years old my drlnkmg had gotten so severe thatl had already 
been to Just about every detox 1n the state of Mame That was avarlable at the t1me Most casesI 
would end up 1n psych wards because they d1dn’t have detox beds when I would present myself 
at the hospltal At tlns t1me the wrthdrawal from alcohol wasn’t terrrble It could be managed 
w1th some meds and a l1ttle supervtsron from medlcal staff But by the t1me I had reached the age 
of 23 that was not the case I was a full-blown alcohol dependent male who 1f I d1dn’t havea 
drmk, I would have severe tremors These qurckly turned mto selzures and after that there Is no 
turnmg back 
I can’t count the number of tlmes where I was rushed to the hospltal v1a ambulance for 
alcohol wrthdrawal I tned domg 1t at home and ahnost d1ed on a few occas1ons Once reachmg 
the hospltal I was stuck m an emergency room bed because there weren’t any detox beds 
avarlable anywhere 1n the state of Mame And smce my symptoms were so extreme 1t was v1tal 
that I be momtored by medrcal professlonals I would 1n most cases stay 1n the emergency room 
for days I mean days and upwards of a week They could not fmd any detox beds and I could not 
be released from the hosprtal, so th1s was my only optlon I can recall a t1me ﬁ"om November of 
2021 where I desperately needed a detox bed, and I had a close fnend of mme dnve me from 
Augusta Mame to Portland trymg to ﬁnd a bed and then all the way up to Bangor wrth no luck 
st1ll Untrl another one of our frrends who we contacted found us a grant bed 1n Derry New 
Hampshrre So that day we drove over 400 mrles trymg to ﬁnd me a detox bed That’s not the 
case for everyone Not everyone 1s so lucky to have such a wonderful lovmg support team l1keI 
do If I had not had these commmnty supports, I mrght not have l1ved that day And thank GodI 
d1d 
I am now 16 months clean and sober from all m1nd- and mood-altermg substances, I am 
about to graduate college wrth my assoc1ates 1n mental health and human servlces I work a full- 
tlme _]Ob as a commumty orgamzer 1n the recovery ﬁeld A tax paymg c1t1zen and have my own 
apartment and a car I’m about to commence from the co-occurnng dlsorder court also known as 
drug court I’m an avrd volunteer for vuh1erable commumtles here 1n the Kermebec County area 
and I host and fac1l1tate meetmgs here as well 
If LD 1719 would have been 1mplemented years ago then my road to recovery mlght not 
have taken so long I mrght have been able to start my Joumey a lot sooner and accompllshed 
more I m1ght not have had to almost d1e on mult1ple occaslons and have to have someone call 
911 because I was hav1ng SCIZUICS from detoxmg at home So please vote ought to pass LD 1719 
so that the many other people who are suffermg greatly mlght have a better chance at ﬁndrng 
recovery and savlng therr l1ves Thank you very much for your t1me and consrderatlon
