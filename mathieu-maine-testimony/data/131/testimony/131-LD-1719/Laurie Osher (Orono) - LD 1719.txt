Testimony of Representative Laurie Osher supporting  
LD 1719, An Act to Establish Substance Use Disorder Treatment 
Centers   
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health an d Human Services  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and esteemed members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, I am Laurie Osher and I represent District 25, the majority of Orono. Thank 
you for the opportuni ty to share my support for LD 1719, An Act to Establish Substance Use 
Disorder Treatment Centers . I am grateful to House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross for bringing 
this proposal forward.  
 
LD 1719 addresses a crucial piece of the continuum of care for people with substance use 
disorder. As members of the committee know, substance use treatment is incredibly difficult to 
access, because there simply arenâ€™t enough spots available in treatment programs and facilities to 
meet the need. This bill is an important st ep toward bridging the gap.  
 
I have been proud to work with the recovery advocacy community and many fellow legislators to 
support harm reduction policies, and just last month, I came before this committee with a 
proposal to create harm reduction centers.  We know that harm reduction policies are critical to 
keeping our loved ones, friends and neighbors with substance use disorder alive - and we have 
more work to do, because Mainers are dying every day. In 2022, we lost almost two people a 
day, on average, to preventable overdoses.  
 
Just as we work to enact these life -saving harm reduction policies, we also need to ensure that 
every single person who needs a detox bed or a receiving center has a place to go when they are 
ready to pursue treatment.   
 
I urge  you to please support LD 1719. Please feel welcome to contact me with any questions you 
may have for me.
