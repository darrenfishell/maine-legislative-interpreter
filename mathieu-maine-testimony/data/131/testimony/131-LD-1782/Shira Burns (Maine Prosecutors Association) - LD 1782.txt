“An Act to Empower Jurors by Allowmg Instructlons That They May F1nda

Before the J o1nt Standmg Commrttee on J ud1c1ary 
Publ1c Hear1ng Date May 10, 2023 
Test1mony 1n Oppos1t1on of LD 1782 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen and members of the J o1nt Standmg Commlttee on 
J ud1c1a1y My name 1s Sh1ra Burns and I represent the Marne Prosecutors Assoc1at1on and am 
test1fy1ng 1n oppos1t1on of LD 1782 
Jury null1f1cat1on has been deﬁned as “the und1sputed power of the Jury to acqult, even If Its verdlct 
1s contrary to the law as grven by the Judge and contrary to the evrdence ”1 However, Jury 
null1f1cat1on has never been found to be a r1ght of a defendant In contrast, the Mame Supreme 
J ud1c1a1 Court has “long held that It 1s the functlon of the court to mstruct Jurors on the law, and 1t 1s 
d b the law as 1t 1s stated 1n court ”2 the duty of the Jurors to declde the facts and be governe y 
In State v Masker, the Court looked at how other Jur1sd1ct1ons treated Jury nulhﬁcatlon and found 
the follow1ng 
Cr1m1nal defendants are not ent1tled to an Instructron of Jury nul11ﬁcat1on Unzted Statesv 
Trujzllo, 714 F 3d 102, 105-106 (11th C1r 1983) 
“Nelther the court nor counsel should encourage Jurors to exerclse th1s power [of 
nulhﬁcatlon] ” Urzzted States v Sepulveda, 15 F 3d 1161, 1190 (1“ C1r 1993) 
“It 1S well estabhshed that Jury nu1l1ﬁcat1on IS ne1ther a r1ght of the defendant, nor a defense 
recogmzed by law ” New Hampshzre v Sanchez, 152 N H 625, 883 A 2d 292, 296 (NH 
2005) 
Mame speclﬁcally addressed the doctr1ne of Jury null1ﬁcat10n and found the followlng 
Our conclusron 1s that such a doctrme cannot be ma1nta1ned, that It 1s contrary to the 
fundamental max1ms of the common law, contrary to the L1I11fO1 ‘1'1'1 practlce of the hlghest

courts of _]Lld1C8I1lI'6 1n Great Br1ta1n, where our Jury system orlgmated and matured, contrary 
to a vast preponderance Of_]l1d1C18.l author1ty1nth1s country, contrary to the sp1r1t and 
meanmg of the constltutlon of the Un1ted States and of th1s State, contrary to a fa1r 
lnterpretatron of our leg1slat1ve enactment, authorlzrng the reservatlon of questlons of law 
for the dec1s1on of the law court, and the allowance of excepnons, contrary to reason and 
ﬁtness, 1n Wlthdrawmg the 1nterpretat1on of the laws from those who make 1t the busmess 
and the study of thelr llves to understand them, and cormmttrng 1t to a class of men who, 
belng drawn from non-professlonal l1fe for occas1onal and temporary servlce only, possess 
no such quahﬁcatlons, and Whose declsrons would be certam to be conﬂlctmg 1n all 
doubtful cases, and would therefore lead to endless confus1on and perpetual uncertamty3 
Th1s proposed leg1slat1on would be at odds regard1ng the Mame Rules of Evldence, specrﬁcally 
relevance Currently, a lot of evrdence regardmg why a case 1s gomg to tr1al 1s not heard and not 
consrdered by the factﬁnder For mstance, 1n a v1olat1on of a protect1on from abuse order case, the 
Jury may only hear that an order was 1ssued, defendant had notlce of the order, and the facts of the 
v1olat1on that occurred The v1olat1on mlght be a smgle text to the v1ct1m saymg “hr” when a no 
contact order 1s 1n place That would be the l1m1ted rnformatron ava1lable to the Jury to dec1de 1f the 
State has proved every element of the cr1me beyond a reasonable doubt Any 1nformat1on grven to 
the Jury about why the v1ct1m obta1ned a protect1on from abuse order would not be relevant, but 
would be germane to decrdmg 1f the facts of the case Would y1eld an un_]ust result However, 1f the 
Marne Rules of Evldence expanded to allow evldence 1n regard1ng why a gurlty verdlct would not 
y1eld an llI1_]L1S'[ result, every tr1al would expand exponent1ally for the State to show why Jury 
null1ﬁcat1on 1s not approprrate 1n that case 
Lastly, the Comt currently has a tool at the1r dlsposal to d1sm1ss cases based on de m1n1m1s 
rnfractlons 4 Th1s statute was des1gned to g1ve the Court a degree of ﬂex1b1l1ty 1n the adm1n1strat1on 
of the law to each 1nd1v1dual case takmg 1nto cons1derat1on everythlng known about the case and 
the 1nd1v1duals assoclated w1th the case 
For these reasons, the Mame Prosecutors Assoc1at1on 1s 1n oppos1t1on of LD 1782
