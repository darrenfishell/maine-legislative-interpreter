Testimony in Opposltion to LD 1782, An Act to Empower Jurors by Allowing Instructions 
That They May Find a Defendant Not Guilty if a Guilty Verdict Would Yield an Unjust Result 
Senator Carney, Representauve Moonen, and honorable members of the JoInt Standmg 
Comnnttee on JudIcIaIy, my name Is Aaron Frey, and I have the prIvIlege to serve as Mame’s 
Attorney General I am here today to testIfy In opposItIon to L D 1782, An Act to Empower Jurors 
by Allowing Instructions That They May Find a Defendant Not Guilty if a Guilty Verdict Would 
Yield an Unjust Result 
In crlmmal cases, Judges Instruct Jurors that If the prosecutI0n has proven beyonda 
reasonable doubt all of the elements of the offense, they must return a verdIct of gullty Tlns b1ll 
would requIre Judges to Instruct JurIes that even If they ﬁnd that the pro secutIon proved all elements 
beyond a reasonable doubt, they may st11l ﬁnd a defendant not gurlty If In theIr own personal 
opImon, a gullty verdrct would y1eld an “unJust result” ThIs would expressly authonze Jury 
nul1IﬁcatIon, whIch occurs when JurIes acqurt a defendant who 1S factually guIlty because they 
dIsagree wIth the law as wrItten or wIth Its appllcatlon to a partlcular defendant The Marne Law 
Court and a maJ orIty of states have reJected the ofﬁclal sanctIonIng of Jury nullIﬁcatIon See, e g, 
State v Masker, 912 A 2d 583, 585 (Me 2007) (“We have long held that It Is the functIon of the 
court to mstruct Jurors on the law, and It Is the duty of the Jurors to decIde the facts and be governed 
by the law as It 1S stated by the court ”) 
By expressly authorIzIng JurIes to engage In nullIﬁcatIon, thIs bIll undermmes basIc 
prmclples of our Justlce system It Is for the LegIslature to determme what Is and what Is nota 
cnme and to provIde for defenses Junes are expected to faIthfully apply that law, and not 
substItute therr own notIons of what Is rIght and wrong for that of the Leg1slature. If a law Is unfarr, 
the LegIslature can change It We should not permlt IndIvIdua1 JurIes, on a case-by-case basIs, to 
make that determmatIon 
Further, It Is crItIca1 that crImmal JustIce be admlmstered umformly and ImpartIally Two 
defendants Who engaged m the same conduct should be subJect to the same legal standards 
AuthorIzIng Jury nullIﬁcatIon presents sIgnIﬁcant rIsks that Jurors wIll rely on wholly 
InapproprIate and Irrelevant factors In reachIng a verdIct For example, defendants of a partrcular 
race, natIonalIty, gender, or socIoeconom1c status may be treated more harshly than others 
Whether a defendant 1S found guI1ty mrght depend on the extent to whIch they are skllled at 
engenderIng sympathy QuIte sImply, Jury nullIﬁcatIon grves rIse to arbltrarmess, whIch 
undermInes trust and conﬁdence In our crImInal Just1ce system 
I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 1782 I am happy to answer any questIons
