Judicial Branch testimony in opposition to LD 1782, An Act to Empower 
Jurors by Allowing Instructions That They May Find a Defendant Not Guilty 
if a Guilty Verdict Would Yield An Unjust Result: 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name 1S Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch I would like to provide 
testimony and comments regarding this bill 
Instnicting the Jury is an mtegral part of the trial process and falls solely within the reahn 
of the presiding Judge There are no Maine statutes regarding Jury instructions because to do so 
may infringe on constitutional separation of powers 
There have historically been instances where Jury nulliﬁcation occurs due to common 
perceptions that a particular statute 1S unJust If that is the case, then the appropriate remedy 
would be for the Legislature to repeal or amend the statute 
Jury uistructions involve the court explaining to the Jury (1) how to ﬁnd the facts based 
on the evidence they Just heard, and (2) applying the law to the facts and dctermimng if the state 
has proven the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt In many trials, attomeys for both 
parties submit proposed instructions, the Judge reviews the submissions and drafts the 
instructions to be delivered to the Jury Jury instructions may be quite lengthy depending on the 
number and complexity of the issues presented For a Judge to painstakingly explain the duties of 
the Jury and immediately follow the mstruction with an alternative instruction that allows them to 
disregard everything they Just heard, would be coiifusmg to the Jurors The role of the Jury is 
critical to the administration of Justice, and it 1S important that Jurors understand their duties 
Both Maine and federal case law support the position that Juries should not be instructed 
on Jury nulliﬁcation Jury nulliﬁcation has been defined as the “undisputed power of the Jury to 
acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by the Judge and contrary to the 
evidence, ” State v Sanchez, 152 NH 625 (2005) 
5/10/23
It may be a real1ty of hfe that Juror nu111ﬁcat1on occurs 1n some 
cases, but we have never recognrzed Jury null1ﬁcat1on as a r1ght of 
the defendant We have long held that 1t 1s a funct1on of the court 
to rnstruct Jurors on the law, and 1t 1s the duty of Jurors to dec1de 
the facts and be governed by the law as 1t 1s stated by the 
court The quest1on 1n State v Wrzght, 53 Me 328 (1865) was 
whether m the tr1a1 of cr1mma1 cases, the Jury may nghtfully 
dlsregard the 1nstruct1ons of the court, 1n matters of law, and, 1f 
they thmk the mstruct1ons Wrong, c0nv1ct or acqult contrary to 
such 1nstruct1ons We answered the quest1on w1th a resound1ng 
linoH 
State v Masker, 2007 ME 4 The federal courts of appeals that have cons1dered th1s quest1on 
have held that cr1m1na1 defendants are not entrtled to an 1nstruct1on OI1_]1lI'y nulhﬁcatron See 
Unzted States v Trujzllo, 714 F 2d 102, 105-106 (11“‘ C1r 1983) 
A Maryland case has stated that 1t 1s "dangerous" to provrde an 1nstruct1on that has the 
potent1a1 to comprom1se the Jurors‘ evaluat1on under the reasonable doubt standard and 1nJect 
emotron 1nto the del1berat1ve process because 1t r1sks d1stract1ng the Jurors from the1r ob11gat1on 
to dec1de the case based on the evrdence and the law See Chambers v State, 337 Md 44 (1994) 
Th1s 1s precrsely the type of behavror that Jury nullrﬁcatron promotes 
Th1s b1l1 1s at a m1mmum m1sgu1ded, and at worst attempts to tum the cnmmal Just1ce 
system on 1ts head 
We request that the comm1ttee vote ought-not-to-pass on LD 1782 Thank you for your 
cons1derat1on
