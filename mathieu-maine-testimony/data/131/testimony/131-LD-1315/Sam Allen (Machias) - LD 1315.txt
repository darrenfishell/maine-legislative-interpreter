Good afternoon. My name is Sam Allen and I live in Machias, Maine. I am a member of the 
Maine Advocacy project and I am youth who has been directly impacted by Substance Use 
Disorder. 
I support LD 1315 an act to require instruction in schools on substance use prevention and 
administration of Naloxone. 
I love people in recovery and I love people who use drugs. My Dad died in December of 2021 in 
Bangor; his death was directly linked to substance use disorder. I have many family members 
who have died from substance use disorder and I have many family members that have found 
recovery. I support LD 1315 because everyone deserves to live and dead people can't recover. I 
support this bill to help other children avoid losing a parent to substance use disorder. The 
more kids understand addiction and have the tools to help prevent addiction and overdose 
deaths the less children there will be without a parent. I want to help other kids learn about 
ways to prevent addiction and prevent deaths. The more we all become part of the solution the 
smaller the problem will be.
