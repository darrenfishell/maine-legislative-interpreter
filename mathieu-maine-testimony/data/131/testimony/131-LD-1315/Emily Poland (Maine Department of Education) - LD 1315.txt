LD 1315 , An Act to Require Instruction in Schools on Substance Abuse Prevention and 
Administration of Naloxone Hydrochloride , proposes that  secondary schools  should annually 
provide students with an age -appropriate instructional program on the use and misuse of drugs

bill adds to the existing language in Title 20-A Subchapter 7 -A, §6604. Substance use disorder 
programs , §6605. Department role , and §6606. Participation in substance use disorder services .

In 2022, the D OE asked school administrative units  (SAU)  to report if they currently have a 
policy allowing naloxone to be stock ed in their schools. At that time 43 SAUs reported a  policy, 
with 31 of those allowing unlicensed staff to administer naloxone, if they had been trained. 
According to t he 2022 report, naloxone  was administered in a Maine school at least once  during  
the 2021 -22 school year. The School Nurse Regional Liaisons  (SNRL)  have provided technical 
assistance to at least five school districts in the past four months specifically related to naloxone.  
As directed by the 130th Maine legislature  the Department provides guidelines and resources  for 
schools who choose to stock emergency medication for a suspected opioid overdose on school 
grounds. Schools in Maine can work with the Maine Naloxone Distribution Initiative  to access 
naloxone free of charge.    
 Sample Naloxone Policy  (docx)   
 Nasal Spray Naloxone Administration Protocol   
 Sample Collaborative Practice Agreement [Includes both Naloxone and Epinephrine] 
(PDF)  (Word)   
 Training from the American Heart Association   
 
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD  1315 , An Act to 
Require Instruction in Schools on Substance Abuse Prevention and Administration of Naloxone 
Hydrochloride  and respond to  any questions during the upcoming work session.
