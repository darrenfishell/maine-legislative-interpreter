Testimony  
Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1315: An Act to Require Instruction in Schools on Substance Abuse Prevention and 
Administration of Naloxone Hydrochloride   
John Kosinski, Government Relations Director, Maine Education Association  
Before the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee  
April  11, 2023  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other esteemed members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee,   
 
My name is John Kosinski (he/him)  and I am proud to serve as the Director of Government Relations for 
the Maine Education Association (MEA).  The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, 
including teachers and other professionals in nearly every public school in the state an d faculty and other 
professional staff in the University of Maine and Community College Systems.  
 
I submit this testimony on behalf of the MEA neither for nor against LD 1315, An Act to Require 
Instruction in Schools on Substance Abuse Prevention and Admi nistration of Naloxone Hydrochloride.   
 
The MEA is fully aware of the opioid crisis in our state.  We support efforts for the state to address the 
scourge of opioid addiction through treatment, education, and the distribution of Narcan to address the 
most  dire of situations.  Public schools have seen the opioid crisis up close.  Public schools educate the 
children of those struggling with substance abuse.  We fully support substance abuse prevention 
education and many schools are already engaged in various  programs to educate students about the 
dangers of substance abuse.  In fact, substance abuse is often central to the health and physical education 
curriculum in most if not all schools.  
 
However, as we have testified already this session, we are deeply c oncerned about the number of bills 
this session proposing mandates on the school day and various elements of curriculum.  We appreciate 
the Committee has settled on a study of the school day instead of passing various bills that impact the 
schedule s of sch ools.  But there are several other bills before this Committee or coming before this 
Committee to mandate various programs and courses in our prek -12 schools.  Each proposal on its own, 
including this one, may have merit.  In fact, we agree with the intent  of LD 1315.  But we are deeply 
concerned about the various mandates when evaluated in their totality.  We hope the Committee will 
hold all mandates to the end of the Committee schedule, so you can see the various curriculum or 
program mandates together, a nd make decisions about the priorities worth moving forward.  In the 
unlikely scenario that all o r even most of the mandates before this Committee pass, the impact on 
schools would be crushing.  Each new proposed mandate, if passed, would have a ripple eff ect in some 
or all schools.  The impacts can only be fully understood when viewed together.
