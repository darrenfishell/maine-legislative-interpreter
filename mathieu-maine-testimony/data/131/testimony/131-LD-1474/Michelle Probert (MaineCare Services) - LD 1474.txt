Re:  LD 1474 – Resolve, Directing the Department of Health and Human Services to Expedite 
Reimbursement of Nursing Facilities  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide information neither for nor against  LD 1474, Resolve, Directing the 
Department of Health  and Human Services to Expedite Reimbursement of Nursing Facilities . This 
bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules to require the 
department to reimburse at least 75% of a nursing facility's costs pursuant to the facilit y's cost 
reports within 90 days of receipt.  
 
Language in the bill needs to be updated from “75% of a nursing facility’s costs pursuant to the 
facility’s cost reports” to “75% of the as -filed settlement.”  The as -filed settlement is the calculation 
of the ov er or underpayment of the allowable MaineCare reimbursement for a given 
period.  Facilities are paid throughout the year based on their approved interim rate.  The cost report 
compares their allowable reimbursement for the period to the payments they’ve alre ady received 
to arrive at an amount due to/from the provider.  There are caps that are built into the reimbursement 
mechanism,  so some facilities do not get reimbursed their actual costs.  
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider t his bill going forward. If you 
have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director  
MaineCare Services
