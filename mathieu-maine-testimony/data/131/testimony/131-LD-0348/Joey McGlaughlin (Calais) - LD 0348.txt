Good evening, members of the Education Committee. My name is Joey and my 
pronouns are he/him. I am 17 years old and also a high school student. 
I am also someone who has experienced a menstrual period for 5 years. Periods are 
not restricted to one gender. I am a man, I’ve been a man for 4 years. It is not my 
choice, nor do I want it, but it is something that happens to me regardless. 
In a lot of bathrooms, students have to pay for period products in vending machines - 
which isn’t fair for those who may be unable to afford them. Your financial capability
should not decide whether or not you bleed through your pants that day. 
Additionally, I am sure most people who have periods understand the annoyance, and 
sometimes panic, of having an unexpected period and being completely caught off 
guard. Menstrual cycles can often be irregular, especially for those taking hormonal 
birth control or testosterone as a form of HRT. Lack of access to period products 
could force a man to go into the women’s restroom just to get what he needs. 
Real men know how to bleed. And we need access to menstrual products when we do.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and please vote ought to pass on LD 348.
