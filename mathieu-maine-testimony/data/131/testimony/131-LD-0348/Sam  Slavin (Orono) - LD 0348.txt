Dear
Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs
Committee,
My
name
is
Sam
Slavin
and
I
live
and
grew
up
in
Orono,
Maine.
I
am
writing
today
to
ask
you
to
support
LD
348:
An
Act
to
Make
Menstrual
Products
A vailable
in
Certain
Schools
Lacking
access
to
menstrual
obstructs
educational
engagement.
The
need
for
menstrual
products
spans
across
all
genders.
Menstrual
products
are
needed
in 
every
bathroom.
My
body
does
not
have
a
need
for
menstrual
products,
but
this
issue
has
impacted
me.
Lacking
access
to
these
products
af fects
everyone,
not
just
those
who
use
them.
In
high
school,
most
of
my
friends
were
people
who
used
menstrual
products.
However ,
numerous
times,
my
friends
did
not
have
access
to
needed
tampons
or
pads.
During
the
school
day ,
when
they
for got
to
bring
their
products,
I
would
help
my
friends
frantically
run
around
the
school
looking
to
see
if
any
other
friends
had
any
products
they
could
share.
This
disrupted
our
class
time.
This
was
especially
relevant
to
my
friends
who
are
trans-men
and
or
non-binary .
V ery
occasionally ,
donated
pads
were
put
in
the
women’ s
restroom.
However ,
this
was
never
the
case
for
the
men’ s
restroom.
There
was
no
gender -neutral
restroom,
but
products
must
be
made
available
in
these
as
well.
Starting
at
the
age
of
15,
I
would
purchase,
with
my
own
money ,
menstrual
products
for
my
friends
to
avoid
educational
disruption.
The
fact
that
a
15-year -old
boy
has
to
buy
products
for
his
friends
casts
light
on
the
severity
of
this
issue.
This
is
frustrating
to
me
and
does
not
feel
right.
Menstrual
products
are
a
human
right.
They
must
be
made
free
and
accessible
in
Maine
schools,
in
all
bathrooms.
Please
support
LD
348
to
protect
health-based
rights,
provide
access
to
menstrual
products
in
all
bathrooms,
and
prevent
educational
disruption.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
