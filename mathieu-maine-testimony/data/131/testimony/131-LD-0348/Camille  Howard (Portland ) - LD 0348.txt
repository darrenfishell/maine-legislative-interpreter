LD 348
To the educational and cultural affairs committee, 
My name is Cam Howard, and I'm a nonbinary person currently living in Portland, 
Maine. I was raised in Princeton and Baileyville in Washington County. I'm writing 
today in support of LD 348. I think that this bill would be an exciting addition to 
Maine public middle and high schools. 
When I was in high school, I was very confused about who I was and who I wanted to
be. I started menstruating when I was eleven years old, and quickly learned to keep 
my menstrual experience to myself. In middle school, I had several embarrassing 
"leaks." It was hard to tell who was also having this experience, who had and hadn't 
started, and which of my friends might have an extra pad or tampon on hand. And on 
top of all of that, I was trying to untangle my gender dysphoria. When I was able to 
find products at school, they were available in the Girls' locker room. 
Making menstrual products available in all middle and high school bathrooms in 
Maine will create a safety net for students who are questioning their gender, adjusting 
to new bodily experiences that can be very embarrassing, and support students who 
don't have reliable financial access to menstrual products. I urge you to pass this bill 
and support it financially so that Maine students can learn, thrive, and embrace who 
they are. 
thank you for your time.
