TESTIMONY NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 3 48 
 
ACT TO MAKE MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Victoria Wallack, communications and g overnment relations director for Maine School Management  
Association , testifying on behalf of the legislative committee s of the Maine School Boards  Association and 
Maine School Superintendents Association , neither for nor against  L.D. 34 8. 
 
Our association s are neither for nor against this proposal because our support for a similar bill  heard  last 
session ultimately got nowhere because there was no funding attached. Without that funding it was deemed a 
mandate and failed to get the  necessary number of votes  in the 130th Legislature.  
 
We do recognize the need to have free products available , particularly for families who are on limited 
incomes. The affordability issue is very real. The prices of these products rose on average by an es timated 10 
percent in 202 2, according to new s reports.  
 
It was also noted in last year’s hearing that some students miss school when they are menstruating because 
they can’t afford the products.  
 
Making them available in schools, of ten through the nurs e’s office, is the right  approach. For all we do to try 
to support school attendance, this is a simple fix  that should be pr operly funded and deserves your support .
