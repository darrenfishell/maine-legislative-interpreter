Testimony 
In Support of 
LD 348 An Act to Make Menstrual Products Available in Certain Schools 
Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs 
May 9, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, 
h hers I am serving as President of the Maine My name is Grace Leavitt. My pronouns are she, er, . 
l l ve from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51. I have over 43 years of Education Association whi e on ea 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certiﬁed teacher. The MEA represents 
nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-l2 schools as well as in our 
institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine Community 
College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as well as many retired educators. 
I am here to testify on behalf of MEA in support of LD 348 An Act to Make Menstrual Products 
Available in Certain Schools. 
In 2021, MEA testiﬁed in support of LD 452~—this same bill. While it was passed on both votes in the 
House and on the ﬁrst vote in the Senate, it was placed on special appropriations table, and then the 
legislature adjourned so it was not enacted. It had a much higher ﬁscal note at the time, which MEA ' ' ' 
. N netheless here we are, two years later, questioned and felt certain was much too high a calculation o , 
' ' 
lit . Since 2021 in the past two years, how many days of school hoping that this ﬁnally becomes rea y , 
have students who menstruate missed, due to a lack of access to menstrual products? While we do not 
have data on this for our state, we know from studies that in the United States between 20-25% of 
tudents who menstruate struggle to afford proper menstrual products ‘ , and that many of these students ' ' 
unstable housings 
have missed school because of thisz . Obviously for our students who are experiencing . . .
t or who are lacking housing altogether the impact 1S even grea er. 
l d cts in their nurses’ ofﬁces, access is limited. And it VVhile schools already provide menstrua prou 
means that a student must ﬁrst ask to go to the nurse’s ofﬁce and often can be difﬁcult for a young ' 
l t' 
me. student to do, and then the student misses even more c ass1 
We would never consider handling the accessibility of toilet paper in the same way, would We‘? Why 
should menstrual products, which are as much a necessity, be handled any differently? 
The lack of accessibility to menstrual products affects not only a student’s attendance in class or even 
attendance for the full school day or for several days of school each month, this situation also impacts 
the student’s overall health—physical as well as mental health? This all, of course, impacts leaming for 
students who menstruate, and continues a longstanding inequity for half of the student population. 
At least l8 other states provide menstrual products in schools. Let’s make Maine the next state to do so 
and end this inequity.
