RE:  LD 765 --   An Act to Permit Recordings of a Protected Person  to Be Admissible in   
       Evidence  
 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Mem bers of the Committee on Judiciary,  
 
MTLA opposes the provisions of LD 765 that addresse s the statutory adoption of an exception to the hea rsay rule 
of the Maine Rules of Evidence.  
 
The provisions in LD 765 which provide for a statut ory hearsay exception for child advocacy center rec ordings 
are in contrast to the process for adopting rules o f evidence that have long been within the purview o f the Maine 
Supreme Judicial Court. The hearsay rules in our Ma ine Rules of Evidence are detailed, complex, and ha ve been 
developed and adopted over many years —decades even —through a long established procedure. This process 
involves careful consideration by the Advisory Comm ittee on the Rules of Evidence, a special committee  
convened by the Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.  The Committee is comprised of pros ecutors, 
defense lawyers, and judges.  After a long and cons idered process, the Committee makes recommendations  to the 
Maine Supreme Judicial Court and, if appropriate, t he Court will then send out a request for comment t o 
interested parties.  Following that period of time,  the Court will then consider whether to make the r ule change 
and then provide notice to the public.   
 
As detailed above, the established practice of  ado pting new evidence rules has been through the Maine  court 
system. By permitting the Legislature to be involve d in crafting rules of evidence, the Legislature wo uld be 
abandoning an established practice which  could lea d to legal complications in the future..  
 
MTLA appreciates the concerns with witnesses under the age of 18 and their potential testimony at a tr ial.  
However, these concerns should be addressed within the court system as they have been in the past. In 
conclusion, the best place for changes to the hears ay rules is with the courts, not the Legislature.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
/s Susan A Faunce
