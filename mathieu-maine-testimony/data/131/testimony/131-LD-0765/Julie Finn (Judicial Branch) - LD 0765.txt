Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 765, An Act to Permit 
Recordings of a Protected Person to be Admissible in Evidence: 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie F inn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
some brief testimony regarding this bill. 
This bill provides that a recording of a forensic interview, as described in the legislation, 
is: (1) an exception to the hearsay rule; and (2) admissible as evidence in court. While the 
Judicial Branch does not disagree that there can be a statutorily created exception to the hearsay 
rule, we do have concerns with making certain evidence automatically admissible by statute, 
without consideration by a judge. 
Deciding what is and is not admissible into evidence is clearly a function of the presiding 
judge. We respectfully suggest that requiring by statute that certain evidence is admissible 
violates the doctrine of separation of powers. 
Thank you for your consideration.
