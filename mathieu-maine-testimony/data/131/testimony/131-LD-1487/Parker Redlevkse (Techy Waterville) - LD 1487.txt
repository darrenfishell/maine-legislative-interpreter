: Hi Iâ€™m Parker, I started my own electronic repair store in Waterville when I was 13 
and we now have 8 people that work here and we fix all type of electronics. I am here 
today to discuss the right to repair act with my step dad Jonathan Irwin.
The Right to Repair not only helps local businesses that repair devices but also 
consumers to help them keep their devices longer and not have them forced to not 
work, or start working poorly, due to the manufacturers saying it is time. I own a store
here in Maine and am part of a franchise which owns over 200 locations and several 
repair brands and this is common discussion amongst all of them. This is something 
we need to take seriously as more things in our life become tech related in our daily 
lives. This is something that would save many families money as they can keep their 
existing devices lasting longer or purchase used devices and know they will continue 
to have many years able to use them and have them repaired.
