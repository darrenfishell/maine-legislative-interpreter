If a manufacturer is required to make repair information, tools and parts available to 
independent repair providers, it would have negative effects on authorized dealers of 
the manufacturer.
First, if independent repair providers can access the same repair information and tools
as authorized dealers, without fulfilling the requirements to be an authorized dealer, 
they may depreciate the value of products by completing poor service at a lower cost. 
This could result in reduced revenue for authorized dealers, as customers may choose 
to go to independent repair providers instead.
Second, manufacturers distribute products and parts through an authorized dealer 
network and have no infrastructure in place to sell directly to end users. 
Finally, if independent repair providers can access repair information and tools 
without completing authorized dealer requirements regarding training, inventory 
stocking levels, marketing, selling new products, it creates an unfair advantage 
against the authorized dealer.
Overall, the requirement for manufacturers to make repair information and tools and 
parts available to independent repair providers would have negative effects on 
authorized dealers and go against the dealer protection laws that have been 
established through years of hard work and negotiation.
