Right to Repair Testimony 
April 2023 by Willie Cade 
Chair and committee members thank you for the opportunity to testify today.  I come 
before you today to clear up the myths about Ag ricultural Right to Repair.  According to 
the US Department of Justice in their recent filing in a Statement of Interest, in a case 
where a Missouri farmer and ot hers are suing John Deere,1 they say,  
Consistent with Supreme Court precedent,  the policy of the United States is “to 
enforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of industry, the 
abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and monopsony—
especially as these issues ar ise in . . . agricultural markets, . . . repair markets,” 
and elsewhere too. Exec. Order No. 14,036,  § 1, 86 Fed. Reg. 36987 (July 9, 2021) 
and,  
Just last month twenty-eight attorneys General urged congress to “pass expansive Right-to-Repair legislation targeted at automobiles, agricultural equipment , and digital 
electronic equipment to protect our consumers and farmers across the nation
2,” and it 
is a “a bipartisan issue.” 
This is an issue whose time has come, here, in Missouri, today.  You might be asking 
yourself, “Why should we act, especially given the above.”  My answer is simple, 
Missouri farmers can’t and shouldn’t wait, for Washington, the courts, or other state 
legislators.  The time is now, and the place is here.  
Here are a few of the myths, (see also Appendix A:) 
1) Everything  farmers need to make repairs is already provided.
THE TRUTH: There are significant limitatio ns on what can be repaired by  the
consumer,  burdening farmers with long equipment transport and wait times and 
resulting in losses of tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential yields.

Page: 1, Date: 4/10
2) If some corporations' repair limitations  are a problem, the consumer will go
somewhere else: the free market will sort it out.  
THE TRUTH: The market is so heavily mo nopolized, there isn't anywhere else for 
the consumer to go, so corporations have no fear of losing out to a competitor because 
they each do it with their own color . 
3) The technology is too complicat ed for fa rmers to work with.
THE TRUTH: Farmers have been safely  learning new technology since leaving the
horse and plow behind, and they'll learn this too. 
4) Manufacturer s have the right to limit owners' use to protect their brand.
THE TRUTH: No, they don't.  They sold that machine and no longer have  any
owners hip rights to that specific product. 
5) Repair tools enable or even promote tampering, which could be dangerous.
THE TRUTH: People tamper when they do n't have the tools they need. Restoring
their right to repair would actually REDUCE tampering because farmers would have the proper tools to fix their own equipment. 
6) Widely available sof tware will lead to software piracy and other violations
of intellect ual property.  
THE TRUTH: The software used to repair is well controlled through public/private 
military-grade encryption. 
So, we're left with the final argument Deere makes against formalizing a right to repair: 
It would make it harder for them to hire technicians and reduce the income of their 
dealers by breaking their stranglehold over the market. 
For once, I agree with them -- they'll have to compete on the open market just like 
everybody else. Finally, don’t take my word for it just read  John Deere’s Operator’s Manuals, well some 
of them, “A Repair shop or person of th e owner’s choosing may maintain, replace or 
repair emission control devices,” see Appendix C:.

Fact‐Checking 	John	Deere's	Falsehoods: 	The	Battle	 Over	Right	to	Repair	
3/23/2023 | 4:32 PM CDT https://www.dtnpf.com/ag riculture/web/ag/columns/letters-to-the-
editor/article/2023/03/23/fact-checking-john-deeres-falsehoods ?  
To the Editor: 
Corporate farm equipment manufac turers like John Deere are restri cting who can fix the tractors 
they sell, crushing farmers' consumer rights, costing them in time and lost revenue, and 
disrespecting the American legacy of innovation and self-sufficiency. 
As consumer rights advocates battle with these corporations  over the right to repair our own 
property, we confront the same myths again and again. 
In agriculture, these myths are put forth by cor porations like John Deere to maintain a stranglehold 
on the lucrative repair market. This is to the detriment of farmers and independent repair shops, 
which are the backbone of many rural economies. 
I'd like to refute some of the most insidious myths I've seen. Over time, these myths have become 
entrenched in the minds of t he media and even policymakers. Re vealing them as the bogus 
corporate inventions they are is  essential to restoring the rights of American farmers and consumers 
everywhere. 
MYTH: Everything farmers need to make  repairs is already provided. 
THE TRUTH: There are significant limitations on what can be repaired by the consumer, burdening 
farmers with long equipment transport and wait time s and resulting in losses of tens or even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential yields. 
MYTH: If some corporations' repair limitations are a problem, t he consumer will go somewhere else: 
the free market will sort it out. 
THE TRUTH: The market is so heavily monopolized, there isn't anywhere else for the consumer to 
go, so corporations have no fear of losing out to a competitor because they each do it with their own 
color. 
MYTH: The technology is too complicated for farmers to work with. 
THE TRUTH: Farmers have been learning new technology since leaving the horse and plow behind, 
and they'll learn this too. 
MYTH: Manufacturers have the right to lim it owners' use to protect their brand. 
Exhibit A:
Page: 3, Date: 4/10
THE TRUTH: No, they don't. The First Sale doctri ne is well established: W hen you buy a copyrighted 
work, you have the right to alter t hat copy. So, when you buy a tractor, you should be able to fix that 
tractor. 
MYTH: Repair tools enable or even promote tampering, which could be dangerous. 
THE TRUTH: People tamper when they don't have the tools they need. Restoring their right to repair 
would actually REDUCE tampering because farmers would have the proper tools to fix their own 
equipment. 
MYTH: Right to repair will require people to fix their own stuff. 
THE TRUTH: No one is being forced to stop usi ng the dealerships. The right to repair gives 
Americans a chance to make t heir own choices. People can st ill choose to use the dealer. 
MYTH: All dealer technicians are highly trained, skilled, and worth the hourly rate. 
THE TRUTH: There are other highly trained, skilled,  and worth-their-hourly-rat e technicians working 
for independent shops. The owne r of the equipment should have the right to choose which 
technician repairs the equipment they own. 
MYTH: Widely available software will lead to softwar e piracy and other violations of intellectual 
property. 
THE TRUTH: The software used to repair is well controlled through public/private military-grade 
encryption. 
So, we're left with the final argument Deere makes against formalizing a right to repair: It would 
make it harder for them to hire technicians and r educe the income of their dealers by breaking their 
stranglehold over the market. 
For once, I agree with them -- they'll have to co mpete on the open market ju st like everybody else. 
The right to repair is a no-brainer. A law codifying it would counterbalance the excessive power 
consolidated by global equipment manufacturers by requiring them to share basic diagnostic and 
repair tools with equipment owners and repair shops. 
Ultimately, this will help restore innovation, flexibility,  and economic opportunity to farmers and rural 
communities.

Dear
 Representative McMorris Rodgers, R epresentative Pallone , Senator Cantwell  and Senator Cruz: 
As our  states’ chief consumer protection and antitrust  enforcers, we write to  respectfully request 
that you re
double your efforts in the 118th Congress to pass expansive Right- to-Repair  legislation 
targeted at automobiles , agricultural  equipment, and digital electronic equipment to protect our 
consumers and farmers  across the nation.  The Right- to-Rep air is a bipartisan  issue that impacts  every 
consumer, household, and farm  in a time of increasing inflation . It is about ensuring that consumers 
have choices as to who , where, when and at what cost  their vehicles can be repaired . It is about ensuring 
small automobile businesses and “mom- and-pop” auto shops can remain competitive against a closed 
system favored by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). It is about ensuring that farmers can 
repair their tractors for a reasonable price and quickly enough to harvest their crops. It is about ensuring 
that consumers can fix their smar tphones at s mall, ind epen dent repair shops for a fraction of the cost and 
time of sending their phone back to the OEM  or replacing it.   It is about ensuring that rural consumers 
can obtain important repairs locally and quickly. Ultimately, it is about safeguarding competition as a 
key part of our free market economy.   
Manufacturing of automobiles, digital devices,  and agricultural equipment is increasingly 
becoming more technologically advanced and built with more embedded electronics.  OE
Ms often 
control access to these electronics parts,  creating  unfair restraint of trade and a monopoly on repair.  This 
can 
harm consumers directly by driving up prices and is  antithetical to a free  market.  The Federal Trade 
Com mission (FTC) recently highlighted the myriad ways in which manufacturers and dealer s, may 
Exhibit B:
Page: 5, Date: 4/10
“without reasonable justification, be restricting competition for repair services.”1 These methods include 
using adhesives that make parts difficult to replace, limiting the availability of parts and tools, or making 
diagnostic software unavailable.  Some restrictions may even allow OEMs to monopolize certain repair 
markets  and/or raise prices  with impunity . For example, according to  the  United States Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, the cost of repairing a vehicle —an industry with more robust independent repair than many 
others—has increased by more than 66% since 2000.2  
Re
cognizing th is growing problem, legislators in the 117 Congress introduced at least three bills 
to address the issue federally :  the Fair Repair Act  (H.R. 4006),3 the Saving Money on Auto Repair 
Transportation Act ( the SMART Act) (H.R. 3664),4 and the Right to Equitable and Professional Auto 
Industry Repair Act ( REPAIR Act ) (H.R. 6570).5   
The
 Fair Repair Act, introduced in June 2021, would require s OEMs to make available to 
indepen dent repair providers and device owners  the documentation, parts, and tools necessary to repair 
their products (excluding vehicles and medical devices). This bil l would decrease repair costs for 
everyday consumers .  Moreover, it would allow farmers —whose equipment is increasingly reliant  on 
digital components—to make on-the-spot repairs once more (or have closer, more responsive, and less expensive independent servicers make repairs) .
 6  This would lower farmers’ repair costs at a time when 
farm input and food prices are increasing , while avoiding the disruptions to planting and harvesting that 
an unexpected equipment failure and distant repair shop can entail.7  
The
 SMART Act, introduced in June 2021, is a bipartisan bill to limit liability for infringement 
of a design patent based on appearance for a part of a vehicle’s exterior, such as a hood or a fender. It also creates a sunset provision on a design patent for an exterior component of an automobile if an otherwise-infringing part is used to repair or restore a vehicle.  This commonsense legislation allow s 
repair shops to use alternative or off- brand parts to repair vehicles, lowering the cost consumers pay to 
fix their vehicle.   
Simila
rly, the REPAIR Act, introduced in February 2022, is a bipartisan proposed bill to require 
OEMs to provide a vehicle’s owner with certain data generated by the operation of the vehicle itself related to diagnostics, repair, calibration and service through a standardized access platform. The bill also would prevent OEMs from mandating specific brands of parts, tools, or equipment be used on a vehicle ( absent a recall ). This proposed legislation allows a  vehicle ’s owner to designate access of 
vehicle data to any  repair shop or to personally retain  the data.

6 We suggest that the Chairs look to the pending Agricultural Right to Repair Act (S. 3549) as another possible right to repair 
act or as a means of adding express agricultural right -to-repair to the Fair Repair Act. That said, the Fair Repair Act’s 
definition of covered devices encompasse s agricultural equipment.

t importantly, the public wants Right- to-Repair legislation: In a national survey, the Car 
Coalition, a coalition of the independent auto parts manufacturing industry, insurers and other 
companies and associations involved in the auto repair industry, found that 78% of voters agreed with these types of Right- to-Repair legislation and 92% of voters agree that consumers should be able to 
choose between automaker branded and aftermarket car parts when making repairs.
8 In a national survey 
of farmers by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and National Farmers Union, 95% of farmers supported the Right- to-Repair their agricu ltural equipment.
9 Finally, a 2021 Consumer Reports survey shows that 
around 75% off all consumers believe that the manufacturers should be required to make available to independent repair professionals and consumers the basic diagnostic information, tools, and replacement parts needed to make repairs of products generally.
10  But despite widespread public support, none of 
these bills moved forward in the House of Representatives. 
As
 State Attorneys General, we seek federal partners to provide necessary changes to the law 
that will better protect America’s  consumers, particularly at this time of economic uncertainty . Any law 
shoul
d include consumer protections to ensure consumers ar e receiving a safe repair and that  sensitive 
consumer data that could be accessed and collected during a repair  is appropriately protected . 
Accordingly, we urge you to take action to support Right to Repair legislation , with appropriate 
consumer protections.
