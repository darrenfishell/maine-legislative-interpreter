This is our chance to stop manufacturers against planned obsolescence. This is a 
design strategy goes back to the mid 1950’s when a designer for an industry 
suggested that certain products could become obsolete by decisions instead of when 
they failed in order to improve sales. 
What we have found is manufacturers do deploy this strategy in many creative ways. 
All in the interests to drive new device sales. Making devices fail within unreasonably
short amount of time or they abstruct yours and our abilities to restrict us from 
repairing them. 
Whether that being using proprietary screws, glue, use software that pairs with parts 
and motherboards. They use software updates to make aftermarket parts not work 
anymore and make those replacement parts hard to get in the first place. 
All of these things these use to create planned obsolescence and to boost their sales
This issue is a big problem and its one that harms not only consumers, but local 
business and it demands regulation.
Most of us in the industry you’ll find would be against regulation in any other 
circumstance but based on history, efforts that have been made to come to an 
understanding with OEMs which have all been unsuccessful it has led to no other 
option this legislation. 
Implementation of fair repair legislature. 
Manufacturers need to provide access to OEM Parts, OEM Tools, OEM Service 
Documentation.
Companies like Apple, Samsung among many others need to provide these materials 
at fair market value. 
Now Manufacturers will say 3rd party could be harmful that consumers could injure 
themselves but no different than me deciding to work on my own vehicle and change 
my oil or my brakes.
Consumers and local businesses need to have the ability to access these parts and 
resources in order as this benefits consumers and local businesses as well as helping 
stop these items from becoming disposable so easy when the manufactures choose for
them to be!
