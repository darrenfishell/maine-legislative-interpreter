RE: Testimony in OPPOSITION to LD 1445, An Act to Enact a Seasonal Sales Tax to Provide Income Tax Relief to Maine 
Reside nts 
Dear Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee:  
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO of the Retail Association of Maine. I am a resident of Topsham. 
We have more than 350 members statewide and repr esent retailers of all sizes. Maine’s retailers employ more than 
80,000 Mainers. I am here today in opposition to LD 1445.  
 
LD 1445 proposes a 7.5% sales tax in Maine from May to October – 36% increase in the sales tax rate! We are strongly 
opposed to an i ncrease in the sales tax, and the burden it will place on Maine’s retailers to have to change their point -of-
sale systems twice a year. It will also be a nightmare for compliance for people who make purchases during one tax 
bracket, but make a return durin g another tax bracket.  
 
Equally important is that a seasonal sales tax like this will send a message to Maine’s tourists that we are going to stick i t 
to you when you visit Maine in the summer. We are going to charge you more for the privilege to visit Ma ine. No doubt, 
a bill like this will only serve to help New Hampshire’s tourism business and further enhance their tax -free status.  
 
Maine currently has record sales tax receipts. If policymakers want to lower Maine’s income, sales, or property taxes, 
they have the resources to do it without raising other taxes. We are adamantly opposed to LD 1445, and urge the 
committee to quickly vote the bill Ought Not to Pass.  
 
Thank you for the consideration of our comments.
