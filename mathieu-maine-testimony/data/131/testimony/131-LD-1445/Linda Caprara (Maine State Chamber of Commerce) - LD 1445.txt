Linda Caprara
Maine State Chamber of Commerce
LD 1445
Good morning Sen. Grohoski, Rep. Perry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation, my name is Linda Caprara.  I am the Vice President of 
Advocacy for the Maine State Chamber of Commerce.  I am here to offer comments 
in opposition to L.D. 1445 An Act to Enact a Seasonal Sales Tax to Provide Income 
Tax Relief to Maine Residents”  
We oppose L.D. 1445 because it would enact a seasonal sales tax rate of 2% annually 
in the state during the period between Memorial Day and Indigenous Peoples Day.  
According to statistics from the Tax Foundation, this increase this would place Maine 
as one of the highest state tax rates in the nation at 7.5% during that time period. 
  
Maine remains one of the highest taxed states in the country, ranking number 41 in 
terms of state and local tax burden.  Reducing the overall tax burden has been one of 
the top priorities and policy goals for Maine’s business community.  It’s very simple, 
high taxes reduce economic growth.  Since the Covid pandemic has hit, consumers 
and businesses alike have had to wrestle with huge increases in the prices of everyday
items, supplies, and staples.  The cost of goods has skyrocketed due to supply chain 
problems that have trickled down and have caused economic hardship.  
In addition, sales tax increases are regressive and often hit low-income folks that can 
least afford it, the hardest because they spend a higher percentage of their income on 
goods and services.  
I urge the Committee to vote NO on L.D. 1445. I would be happy to answer any 
questions you may have.
