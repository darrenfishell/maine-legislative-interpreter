Greetings
Chairs
Chipman
and
W illiams
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
T ransportation:
My
name
is
James
T assé,
and
I
am
the
assistant
director
of
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
(BCM).
Our
mission
is
to
make
Maine
better
and
safer
for
bicycling
and
walking.
On
behalf
of
our
more
than
20,000
members
and
supporters,
I
am
submitting
this
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1542
“A
Resolve,
to
Direct
the
Department
of
T ransportation
to
Study
the
Use
of
Micromobility
Devices.”
The
BCM
has
been
studying
and
recommending
policy
around
various
micromobility
devices
for
the
last
three
years,
and
having
a
centralized
trove
of
safety
information
at
the
MaineDOT
would
be
helpful.
For
these
reasons,
the
BCM
ur ges
an
“Ought
to
Pass”
report
from
the
committee.
“Micromobility”
is
a
broad
category
of
transportation
devices
that
includes
bicycles
(electric
or
not)
and
other
small
vehicles
such
as
scooters,
e-scooters,
powered
and
unpowered
skateboards,
mono-wheels,
etc.,
which
may
be
used
individually
or
as
part
of
shared
fleets.
These
micromobility
machines
share
the
spaces
used
by
traditional
active
transportation
modes
of
walking
and
bicycle
riding.
Micromobility
devices
are
frequently
used
on
sidewalks,
roadsides,
bike
lanes
and
multi-use
paths.
Micromobility
users
generally
operate
at
less
than
28
mph
and
are
unprotected
by
a
cabin
(i.e.
they
are,
like
walkers
and
bike
riders,
“vulnerable
users”).
On
devices
such
as
boards
and
scooters,
the
operator
needs
to
balance
and
steer
while
operating
some
kind
of
throttle,
which
can
require
considerable
athleticism
and
skill.
These
physical
demands
on
the
user
put
these
devices
within
the
broad
parameters
of
active
transportation.

The
devices
remain
lar gely
unregulated
and
outside
the
legal
framework
in
many
states,
including
Maine.
The
BCM
is
currently
working
with
Representative
Melanie
Sachs
on
broad
operational
guidance
under
§2063
that
would
generally
require
micromobility
operators
to
follow
the
same
rules
as
bicycles.
By
directing
the
MaineDOT
to
compile
data
on
safety ,
policy ,
and
operations
etc.
Maine
will
create
a
basis
for
informed
policy
discussion
that
is
based
on
facts
and
data,
rather
than
perception
and
belief.
Some
of
these
devices
are
demonized
in
lar ge
part
because
they
are
new
and
dif ferent
and
unfamiliar .
Hard
data
will
help
clarify
the
real
impacts
of
these
devices.
The
bill
may
be
refined
by
focusing
on
just
“electric
micromobility”
devices
such
as
e-skateboards
and
e-scooters,
which
are
the
latest
technologies
that
policy
makers
and
planners
are
dealing
with
the
most
frequently .
Ultimately ,
micromobility
devices
are
here
to
stay .
They
are
fun
to
use,
ef ficient,
popular
with
people
of
all
ages,
and
can
of fer
more
mobility
and
range
than
just
human
powered
devices.
Most
importantly ,
they
can
often
provide
alternatives
to
driving
a
car ,
especially
for
trips
less
than
five
miles
in
length.
They
thus
represent
a
great
option
for
persons
with
limited
means
for
whom
an
automobile
is
a
burdensome
expense.
In
order
that
we
may
all
learn
more,
the
BCM
ur ges
an
Ought

vote
on
this
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service
to
the
people
of
Maine.

Testimony in Support of LD 1542
Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Study
 the Use of Micromobility Devices
Greetings Chairs Chipman and Williams and the distinguished members of the 
Committee on Transportation: 
My name is James Tassé,  and I am the assistant director of the Bicycle Coalition of 
Maine (BCM).  Our mission is to make Maine better and safer for bicycling and

 The BCM has been studying and recommending policy around various micromobility
devices for the last three years, and having a centralized trove of safety information at
the MaineDOT would be helpful.  For these reasons, the BCM urges an “Ought to

“Micromobility” is a broad category of transportation devices that includes bicycles 
(electric or not) and other small vehicles such as scooters, e-scooters, powered and 
unpowered skateboards, mono-wheels, etc., which may be used individually or as part

These micromobility machines share the spaces used by traditional active 
transportation modes of walking and bicycle riding. Micromobility devices are 
frequently used on sidewalks, roadsides, bike lanes and multi-use paths. 
Micromobility users generally operate at less than 28 mph and  are unprotected by a

as boards and scooters, the operator needs to balance and steer while operating some
