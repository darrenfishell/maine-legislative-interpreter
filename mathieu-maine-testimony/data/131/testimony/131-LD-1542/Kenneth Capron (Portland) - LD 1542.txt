Roads in Maine are just not in shape to handle these "devices" - and never will be. So 
all the study in the world is not going to begin to make a difference unless and until 
the Maine DOT can bring roads and roadsides up to an acceptable par.
Would this bill include horses and oxcarts in the roadway?
Why didn't BCM do this research themselves and present a meaningful bibliography 
with their request. There's no need for the State to pay for such a useless study? 
Does this bill address the use of these devices on the main part of the vehicle ROW? 
What about sidewalks and parking lanes? How would they interact with obstacles in 
the utility ROW?
Too many issues and the roads just don't meet basic standards. Please vote ONTP.
