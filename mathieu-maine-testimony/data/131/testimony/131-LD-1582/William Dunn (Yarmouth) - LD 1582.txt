L.D. 1582  1 
 TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM H. DUNN, JR. 
BEFORE THE TAXATION COMMITTEE  
LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENT (LD)  1582  
MAY 4, 2023 
 
Thank you Senator Groho ski, Representative Perry  and Committee  members .  My name is Bill 
Dunn .  I moved to Maine in the Fall of 1997 and si nce April 1998 I have lived in my c urrent 
permanent residence at 10  Sunset Point Road in Yarmouth.  
 
I previously testified before the Comm ittee on February  7, 2023 with respect to L.D.  167, which 
proposed to add Life Leases as a form of residence for which a permanent resident could receive 
a Homestead Exemption.  A copy of that oral testimony as well as L.D.  167 is attached  to 
today’s written testimony . 
 
To very briefly  summarize that previous testimony , in 2021 I put my house in an Irrevocable 
Trust control led by my children and I now occupy my permanent residence pursuant to a Li fe 
Lease under which I am responsible for all on -going costs associated with the house, including 
proper ty taxes.  I also get to live in the house for as long as I want or until I die, even though the 
house is now owned by another entity , the Irrevocable Trust.  As a result of putting my house in 
the Irrevocable Trust, even with the Life Lease,  my Homestead Exemption was revoked .  
L.D. 167 would have facilitate d restoration of  my Homestead Exemption.  
 
At that same February 7th hearing, L.D.  149 (copy attached) was introduced which proposed 
another way to resolve the issue with permanent residen ces placed in Irrevocable Trusts.  It 
proposed re moving the word “irrevocable ” from the defin ition of Homestead.  
 
At the February  7th hearing the Committee voted “ought not to pass ” for both L.D.  167 and 
L.D. 149, but both pieces of p roposed legislation were put on a list of issues to be addressed 
when the Committee addressed Homestead issues in the future, including issues as sociated with 
various  legislati ve proposals  for property tax stabilization . 
 
Since the Committee is now taking up L.D.  1582, “An Act to Clarify What Constitutes a 
Homestead for the Homestead Property Tax Exemption, ” now seems to be a good time for the 
Committee to a lso consider the p roposed modifications contained in L.D.  167 and L.D.  149.  I 
would respect fully ask that the Committee to amend the definition  of Homestead in Sec. 1. 
36 MRSA §681, sub -§2 to include the L ife Lease option and amend Sec. 2. 36 MRSA §681, 
sub-§2-A to add the definition  of Life Lease, all as pr oposed in L.D.  167. 
 
Alternatively,  or additi onally , I ask the Committee to amend the definition of Homestead in 
Sec. 1. 36  MRSA §681, su b-§2 to  remove the word “revocable ,” as proposed in L.D.  149. 
 
I am happy to answer any questions  you might have or provide additional  information.  My 
contact details are:

LD 167  1 
 ORAL TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM H. DUNN, JR. 
BEFORE THE TAXATION COMMITTEE  
LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENT (LD)  167 
FEBRUARY  7, 2023 
 
Thank you Senator Groho ski, Representative Perry  and Committee  members .  My name is Bill 
Dunn .  I moved to Maine in the Fall of 1997 and si nce April 1998 I have lived in my c urrent 
residence at 10  Sunset Point Road in Yarmouth.  
 
As I unders tand it, the purpose of the Maine  Homest ead Exemption is to  provide  a measure of 
property tax relief for individuals who have owned Homestead prop erty in M aine for at least 
12 months and for whom the property they occupy on April  1 is their permanent residence.  Such 
property owners receive an exemption of up to $25,000  in the value of their p ermanent residence 
for property  tax purposes , depending on  the loc al certified ratio . 
 
I have been a permane nt resident of Maine for over 25  years , I have lived in my p ermanent 
residence for almost 25  years  and, until recently , I have had a Homestead Exemption .  In August 
2021 I put my permanent residence in a n Irrevocable Trust with my two children  as Trustees.  As 
part of putting  my house in the Irrevocable Trust I signed a Life Lease with my children .  Under 
the terms of the Life Lease,  I am responsible for all on -going costs associated with the house, 
including proper ty taxes, and in retu rn I get to live in the house for as long as I want or until I 
die, even though the house is now owned by another entity , the Irrevocable Trust. 
 
In April 2022 I received a letter from the Assessor for the Town of Ya rmouth indicating t hat my 
Homestead Exemption had been revoke d back in October 20 21, 6  months earlier.   I appealed this 
revocation and there was a hearing on October  20, 2022 at which I elaborated how , under the 
Life Lease,  I am responsible  for all costs assoc iated with the house, includ ing property taxes, 
ordinary and major maintenance a nd repair, utilities and insurance , just like I ha ve been since 
April  1998.  
 
My appeal was rejected because the defini tion of Homestead Exemption only refers to 
Revoca ble Trusts and makes no  provision for an Irrevocable Trust or other arrangement  
combined with a Life Lease.   I would note that Ass essor L eicht man of the Camden are a 
indicated last week during a hearing on LD  149 that a Life Lease, he used the term L ife Estate, 
should be sufficien t to entitle the Ho mestead Exemption.  
 
The purpose of my proposed amendment to the definition of Homestead Exemption , as contained 
in LD  167, is to allow the Homestea d Exemption to be granted to a permanent residen t who 
occup ies their  permanen t residence u nder the provisions of a Life Lease.   My under standing is 
that LD 149 removes the word “revocable ” from the trust definition .  If t hat woul d allow the 
Homestead Exemption for my Irrevo cable Trust, that would also probably solve my issue.  
 
In conc lusion , I ask the Committee to amend the definition of Homestead Exemption as 
indicated in LD  167 or , alternatively, as indicated in LD  149.  I am happy to try to answer any 
questions you mi ght have  and in my written testimony I elaborate below on some knock-on 
effects.

LD 167  2 
  
I am not familiar with why , for permanent residences  in a trust , the Homestead Exemption was 
limited to those in a Revocable Trust, but h is has knock -on effects beyond jus t the up to $25,000 
exemption from property taxes.   I would note that th e revoc ation of my Homestead Exemption , 
even though I am a perman ent resident living in my pe rmane nt residence , has at least two other 
knock-on ef fects : 
 
1. The Town of Yarmouth has a program called  STAY, which stands for Senior Tax 
Assistance Yarmouth.  To take adv antage of this pro gram you have to be at least 67 years 
old (I  am 74), a resident of Y armouth for 10 years (I ’ve be en a resid ent for almost 
25 years), have income less than $101 ,430 (mine is less) and have a Homestead in 
Yarmouth ( I used to have a Homestea d Exemption !). 
 
2. The State has a Property Tax Deferral Program  that is designed to help  seniors to stay in 
their homes and age in place .  It is not clear that  I would meet t he income limitations to 
take advanta ge of this program, but another requirement is to have a H omestead 
Exemption on the property.   So, the current definition may be restricting  other s from 
using the program to stay i n their perman ent reside nces.
