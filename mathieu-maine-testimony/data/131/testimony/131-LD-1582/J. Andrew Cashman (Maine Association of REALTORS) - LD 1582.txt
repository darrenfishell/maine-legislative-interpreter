Testimony in Opposition to LD 1582  
(“An Act to Clarify What Constitutes a Homestead for the Homestead Property Tax 
Exemption ”)  
J. Andrew Cashman on behalf of the Maine Association of REALTORS®  
May 4, 2023  
Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation , 
my name is Andy Cashman. I am the Founder of Resolve Government Relations, and we represent 
the Maine Association of REALTORS®, a professional trade association established in 1936 with 
over 6,500 members statewide. REALTORS® grow Maine’s economy and build Maine communities. 
Our members represent buyers and sellers involved in both residential and commercial real estate 
transactions. Our membership also includes industry affilia tes, such as lenders, closing agents, title 
agents, appraisers, building inspectors, surveyors, etc. The Maine Association is chartered by the 
National Association of REALTORS® (NAR), the largest trade association in the country.  
The Maine Association of REALTORS® opposes LD 1582 and the proposed amendment. T he bill  
and the amendment  would place additional requirements on homestead  eligibility  and result in 
increased  costs for property owners  and municipalities . We oppose c hanges that will decrease the  
accessibility of the  homestead exemption or make it more difficult for property owners to obtain  it for 
their p ermanent  residence.   
For these reasons, we urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 1582 . Thank you for your time and 
consideration.
