Testimony of Rep. Anne Perry introducing 
LD 806, Resolve, to Study the Issue of Persons Who Go Missing in 
State Parks0 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
Good aftemoon, Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker and members of the 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. I am Representative Anne Perry 
and I represent ten communities in Washington County. I am here to introduce LD 806 
“Resolve, to Study the Issue of Persons Who Go Missing in State Parks”. 
_ I am presenting this bill at the request of a constituent who has noticed that a signiﬁcant 
number of people have gone missing in national and state parks nationwide. He feels that 
this is something we should be aware of and keeping some kind of record. 
He will be testifying after me and can give you his concerns. 
Thank you.
