RE: LD 1516 --  An Act to Establish Alternative  Sentencing  for Prim ary 
 Caregivers  
        
Dear Senator Carney, Representativ e Moonen , and Members of the Committee on 
Judiciary,  
 
MACDL supports  LD 1 516. 
 
This unique, thoughtful bill allows a co urt in sentencing a defendant that would 
otherwise result in a term of impriso nment to consider something other than 
imprisonment when the d efendant is a p rimary caregiver of a minor, elderly 
dependent, or individual with a mental or physical disability.  
 
From a technical perspective, it may be  that alternative sentencing  for these persons 
should be addressed at the time of  the sentencing as opposed to on motion  thereafter. 
This would eliminate any issues or concerns as  to the  finality of the sentence and 
whether a court can change a sentenc e after it has been imposed.  
 
However  this bill is ultim ately crafted, allowing a primary  caregiver to not have to 
serve a term of imprisonment would allow for full and fair justice but without the 
expense of often signif icant a nd overwhelmi ng harm to the innocent child, elderly 
dependent, or individual with mental o r physical disability who requires the car e of 
the defen dant.  Indeed, it is these harms that ripple from inc arceration that we should 
all as a society be more  attuned to and take into account when it comes to the 
crimi nal justice system.  
 
Thank y ou for the opportunity to  address this issue.  
 
  Sincerely,  
 
 
 
 Walter F. McKee  
 Chair, Legislative Committee
