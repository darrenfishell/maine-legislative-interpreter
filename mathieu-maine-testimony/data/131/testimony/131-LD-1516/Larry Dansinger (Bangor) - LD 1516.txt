LD 1516
May 1, 2023
To members of the Judiciary Committee of the Maine Legislature:
I am writing in support of LD 1516, “An Act to Establish Alternative Sentencing for 
Primary Caregivers.” This bill would, in some instances, allow for less suffering for 
innocent people, those who committed no wrong but are being punished, indirectly, 
for being a relative or family member of someone judged guilty of a crime.
I would hope all who hear and understand the term “collective punishment” would be 
revolted by the idea. It is practiced in some countries as a threat to the population. If a
member of a family does something considered illegal, even without the knowledge 
of other family members, those other family members could also be punished in some
way. More extreme examples in other countries are house demolitions or denial of 
human rights. 
However, when a child or dependent adult in Maine loses a breadwinner and/or 
caregiver who is jailed, the dependent can be severely hurt, even without being 
directly punished themselves. They are indirectly punished, by losing care and adult 
supervision, income, housing, adequate food, or other basic needs. Some youth lose 
hope in living a respectable life, and they are more likely to enter the  criminal 
punishment system themselves. This is expensive and damaging to community safety 
and security. 
Such “alternative sentencing” would only apply in certain situations; not every 
defendant making such a motion would have it approved. However, even if it were 
allowed in only a minority of situations, it could shrink a new generation of young 
individuals entering the criminal punishment system. 
Please vote “ought to pass” for LD 1516.
Sincerely,
Larry Dansinger
