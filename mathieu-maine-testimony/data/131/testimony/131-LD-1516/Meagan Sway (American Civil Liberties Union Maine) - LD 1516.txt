LD 1516 — Ought to Pass 
An zact to Establish Alternative Sentencing for Primary Caregivers 
Jo1nt Standlng Commlttee on Jud1c1ary 
May 2, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen and d1st1ngu1shed members of the J o1nt 
Standlng Commlttee on Jud1c1ary, greet1ngs My name 1s Meagan Sway, and I am 
pol1cy d1rector of the Amerlcan C1v1l L1bert1es Un1on of Mame, a statewlde 
organ1zat10n c0mm1tted to advanc1ng and preserv1ng c1v1l l1bert1es guaranteed by 
the Mame and U S Constltutlons On behalf of our members, We support LD 1516 
Th1s leg1slat1on came about as the result of the l1ved experlence of people across the 
country—pr1mar1ly women—who experlenced the rupture of the1r famlly structure 
when a fam1ly careglver was sentenced to pr1son Th1s b1ll represents a recogn1t10n 
that we can adm1n1ster]ust1ce 1n a dlfferent, and better, Way 
The b11l a1ms to keep fam1l1es together, lessemng the 1nstances where chlldren are 
pumshed for the actlons of the1r parents Once the1r parents are mcarcerated, l1v1ng 
far away from the ]a1l or pI'1SO1'1 and the cost of phone calls are Just two of the 
myrlad barr1ers that ch1ldren face to staymg connected w1th the1r parents Hav1ng 
an lncarcerated parent 1s assoclated Wlth h1gher adverse chlldhood event scores, 
whlch 1s 1n turn correlated w1th negatlve outcomes later 1n l1fe, 1nclud1ng 1ncreased 
depresslon, problematlc relatlonshlps Wlth drugs, and unemployment 
Th1s b1ll 1s espec1ally relevant here 1n Ma1ne we have the hlghest percentage of 
ch1ldren w1th currently or formerly mcarcerated parents 1n New England 1 Only 13 
other states 1n the country have h1gher parental 1ncarcerat1on rates than Mame2 
And, l1ke elsewhere 1n the cr1m1nal legal system, Black and Indlgenous ch1ldren are 
dlsproportlonally hurt3

If passed, this b111 would allow pr1mary caretakers to pet1t1on the court for 
c0ns1derat10n of a sentencmg alternatlve to 1ncarcerat1on The b111 does not mandate 
a part1cu1ar sentence, but g1ves Judges better leeway to conslder sentencmg that 1s 
approprlate to each defendant, and look for alternatlves that help fam111es stay 
together 
We urge you to vote ought to pass
