Hello, I am a resident of Wales, Maine and live shore side on Sabbatus Pond.  I have 
been concerned about the Pike population in Sabbatus Pond for a number of years as 
it has been accosted by a poorly run derby which has decimated the fish population, 
especially pike.  Please do nothing detrimental to the Pike fishery.  Pike are great to 
fish for, have not negatively impacted other pond fish species and as pike are already 
in the Androscoggin river, there is no harm in having them as the invasive species has
already spread. Please concern yourself with the water quality health of the Pond. 
Here is a suggestion.  When the dam is rebuilt, allow local gravel pit operators to 
remove aggregate from the pond lakebed.  The water will be abnormally low and this 
could be efficiently carried out. Five acre gravel pits do not need SoM permission and
and increase in water depth would lower lake temperatures and remove some 
phosphates from the water column.  At no cost to the State! There are many other 
benefits to this suggestion including assisting the fish population.  By the way, putting
in a fish ladder will allow approximately 200k of alwives into the pond and high 
water temperatures could cause low oxygen levels and a fish die off. Please spend 
SoM monies on improving the pond not pike elimination. By the way, someone will 
just drop more pike into the pond after you eliminate them. Thank you for your 
consideration.
