AARON FREY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL 
 
April 12, 2023 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Honorable Members of 
the Health and Human Services Co, my name is Maeghan Maloney, I am 
the District Attorney for Kennebec and Somerset Counties and the 
President of the Maine Prosecutors Association (“MPA”) and I am 
submitting this written testimony in support of LD 1204 as amended, An Act 
to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Closing Coverage Gaps in the 
MaineCare Program for Incarcerated Persons. 
 Monday night I had dinner with a local physician who works in a 
Maine county jail. She explained to me why Maine needed to apply for a 
section 1115 federal waiver for MaineCare expansion. She explained to me 
how much could be done to improve the continuity of care if only those who 
were incarcerated did not lose their MaineCare. In her words, by giving 
incarcerated people the tools they need for health care success, they will 
be more likely to live successful lives in our community. I agree. 
 In addition, I have witnessed the ever increasing county budgets 
during my ten years as district attorney. These county increases are 
passed on to the municipalities and paid with property taxes. The largest 
driver of county budget increases is the cost of medical care for people 
incarcerated in county jail. I know the property tax payers of Kennebec and 
Somerset counties cannot continue to pay these property tax increases. 
This bill is the solution. This bill will single handily reduce property 
taxes across our great state. And this bill will provide better health care for 
incarcerated Mainers who will soon be living in our communities again.

The MPA is grateful to Speaker Talbot-Ross for having the vision to 
introduce this bill. The MPA believes this legislation is an example of how 
we can make significant positive changes to our state while relieving the 
property tax burden.  
Thank you for your time and I am happy to answer any questions.  
 
Sincerely,
