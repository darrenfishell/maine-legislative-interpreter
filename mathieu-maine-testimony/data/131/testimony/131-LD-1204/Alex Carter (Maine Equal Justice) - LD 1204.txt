Testimony in Support of LD 1204, An Act to Improve the Health of Maine 
Residents by Closing Gaps in the MaineCare Program for Incarcerated Persons 
April 12, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is Alex Carter, I use she/her pronouns, and 
l am a Policy Advocate at Maine Equal Justice, a nonprofit legal aid provider working to increase 
economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine. l am testifying today in support 
of LD 1204, an impactful health care bill with strong bipartisan support. 
individuals involved in our criminal-legal system are disproportionately low income and often 
have complex heaithcare needs.1 These include multiple chronic conditions, higher rates of 
COVID-19 infection} mental illness and substance use disorders? A lack of behavioral health 
services and in-patient treatment in the state contributes to many individuals cycling into and 
out of our prisons and countyjails in what has sadly been referred to as Maine's defacto 
mental health system.“ Incarceration can also disrupt continuity of care and health insurance 
coverage which is critical for the treatment and management of persistent health conditions. 
As the majority of those incarcerated are low income, most are eligible for Medicaid. However, 
federal law limits the services that can be covered for individuals in a jail or prison to inpatient 
hospital or nursing home stays for 24-hours or more outside of a correctional facility. The state 
and counties are therefore responsible for delivering health care to those in their custody, 
including individuals who qualify for Medicaid prior to incarceration. While federal matching 
funds cannot be used for the cost of most services, this so-called "inmate exclusion policy” does 
not prohibit eligibility for and enrollment in Medicaid? States have the option to suspend 
rather than terminate coverage while someone is incarcerated and many states, including

Maine, have worked in recent years to mitigate gaps in care and coverage for those involved in 
our criminal-legal system. 
Thanks to the previous work of the Maine legislature and now Speaker Talbot Ross, Maine law 
already prohibits termination of MaineCare benefits as a result of incarceration and requires the 
state Department of Corrections (DOC) to ensure individuals receive assistance to apply for and 
renew MaineCare benefits during the term of their incarceration. LD 1204 would provide 
necessary clarification that the current statute applies to all correctional facilities, countyjails, 
and regional jails and directs the DOC to enter into a memorandum of understanding with all 
counties that have a jail to facilitate such enrollment assistance. 
In keeping with the amendment proposed by Speaker Talbot Ross, we encourage the Department 
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to seek a waiver to reinstate MaineCare coverage for 
eligible individuals prior to their release. Section 1115 Medicaid demonstration waivers allow 
states to pilot new approaches and waive certain provisions of Medicaid law to further the 
objectives of the program and promote health.6 The Biden Administration has also indicated an 
interest in states proposing pilots to reduce health disparities, including initiatives for those 
involved in our criminal-legal system. 
There is a growing national movement to request 1115 waivers to the inmate exclusion policy. 
California recently became the first state to have their waiver request approved by the Center 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to cover a package of reentry services, 90 days prior 
release. This includes physical and behavioral health services, case management, and 
medication-assisted treatment to help prevent adverse health outcomes upon release and 
many drivers of recidivism. Fourteen additional states, including many in New England, have 
pending waiver requests that vary in terms of the pre-release coverage period, and the scope of 
benefits and populations they seek to cover.7 
Multiple studies show that people are more likely to use the emergency room post 
incarceration and to experience serious health events, including drug overdose and death? 
Improving coverage and care transitions for those prior to release not only improves health 
outcomes, but it also positively impacts community health, reduces recidivism linked to 
untreated mental health and substance use disorders, and reduces state and local health care 
spending. Maine should join our neighbors in seeking a 1115 waiver for critical reentry services. 
For the health and wellbeing of all Maine residents, we ask you to vote ought to pass with the 
Speaker's proposed amendment on LD 1204.
