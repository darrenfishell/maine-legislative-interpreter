Statement of Ceilidh Shea 
Consumers for Affordable Health Care 
To the Joint Standing Committee On Health and Human Services 
Speaking in Support of: 
LD 1204, An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Closing Coverage Gaps in the MaineCare 
Program for incarcerated Persons 
April 12, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee On Health and 
Human Services, thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments in support of LD 1204, An Act 
to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Closing Coverage Gaps in the MaineCare Program for 
incarcerated Persons. 
My name is Ceilidh Shea and I am a Policy Advocate at Consumers for Affordable Health Care,a 
nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates the right to quality, affordable health care for every 
person in Maine. CAHC is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization founded in 1988 and based in Augusta 
whose mission is to advocate the right to quality, affordable health care for every person in Maine. As 
designated by Maine's Attorney General, CAHC serves as Maine's Health insurance Consumer Assistance 
Program (CAP), which operates a toll—free HelpLine. Our Helptine, fields approximately 6,000 calls and 
emails every yearfrom people across Maine who need help obtaining, keeping, using, or fixing problems 
with private health insurance or with accessing or affording health care services. CAHC also serves as the 
Ombudsman program for Maine's Medicaid program, MaineCare, and helps people apply for and 
navigate the enrollment process for MaineCare. it is with that background that vve provide these 
comments. 
Existing Maine law requires the Department to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the 
Department of Corrections to provide incarcerated individuals with assistance applying for MaineCare. LD 
1204 builds upon this to ensure individuals incarcerated in county or regional jail are also provided 
assistance with applying for MaineCare, county or regional jail will ensure that this law is applied to all 
incarcerated persons. 
According to the Prison Policy Institute, approximately 5,000 people are incarcerated in Maine.‘ The 2021 
Maine Department of Corrections Adult Data Report found that in 2021, 359 men completed medication 
assisted treatment for opioid and substance use disorder treatment. 584 men were in outpatient 
treatment and an additional 136 were in residential treatment for opioid and substance use disorder— 
this comes to a total of 1,079 incarcerated men in opioid or substance use disorder treatment. in 2021 
there were 83 women in opioid and substance use treatment programs. “ Substance and opioid use 
disorders are just one of many health issues prevalent amongst incarcerated populations. Ensuring that 
incarcerated people are able to enroll in MaineCare will also help ensure people continue to have »access 
to coverage for needed health ca re services when they leave incarceration, including for preventive care,
treatment for serious and chronic conditions, and mental and behavioral health sen/ices, including 
treatment for substance use disorder. By ensuring more people re-enter their community witha 
MaineCare card in hand, this bill will help people avoid gaps in insurance coverage and reduce disruptions 
in care, which will help to reduce the likelihood of recidivism. Failure to treat substance use disorder, or 
any major disease, in the criminal justice system not only has negative societal implications, but also 
proves to be expensive. A study in California found that participation in treatment while incarcerated was 
associated with lower costs of crime in communities. Treatment while in jail or prison is critical to 
reducing overall crime and other drug-related societal burdens—such as lostjob productivity, family 
disintegration and recidivism? “ A study from Washington state found there was a 16% reduction in 
subsequent detentions over a two year period when people leaving detention were enrolled in 
Medicaid." 
National research over the past decade shows that over 60 percent of those in jail lived at or below the 
federal poverty level before they were arrested. ” ln a 2017 study, the Vera Institute of Justice found that 
although Black people in Maine constituted 2% of state residents, they represented 7% of people in jail 
and 9% of people in prison.“ Due to systemic racism and disparities in our economic and judicial systems, 
incarcerated people in Maine are disproportionately low-income, uninsured, and Black, indigenous, and 
people of color. Ensuring eligible individuals can access l\/laineCare coverage during incarceration isa 
question of equity. For these reasons I urge you to support LD 1204. Thank you and l'd be happy to 
answer any questions.
