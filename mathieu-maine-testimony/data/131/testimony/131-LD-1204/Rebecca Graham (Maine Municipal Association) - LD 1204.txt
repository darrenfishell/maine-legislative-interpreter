T
estimony of the Maine Municipal Association  
In Support For 
LD 1204 -An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Closing Coverage Gaps in the MaineCare 
Program for Incarcerated Persons  
April 12, 2023 
S en. Baldacci, Rep. Meyer and distinguished members of the Health and Hu man Services 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham,  and I am providing testimony in support of LD 1204 on behalf 
of Maine Municipal Association which represents the interests of municipal government before the state 
and federal government. The positions of the Association are formed at the direction of our 70- member  
Legislative Policy Committee, (LPC) who are elected by the selectboards and council of the 
municipalities in each of the 35 Senate districts in Maine.  
LD 1204 makes explicit the intent of PL 2019, c. 492, §2, which was enacted with the assistance 
of this committee and Speaker Talbot -Ross in 2019 who sponsored the bill (LD 761) which formed a 
platform initiative  of Maine Municipal Association  in the 129th . Attached you will find my testimony and 
its intent at that time.  
Municipal property tax assessment  funds the overwhelming majority of county jail operations and 
increasingly this population has complex medical needs and no predictable way of managing those costs. Additionally, mandates for a variety of treatment required f or incarcerated persons has not been met with 
the corresponding state  appropriation for the task. This has le d to consistent increases in county tax 
assessment paid by municipa lities  through the property tax that by construction cannot provide uniform 
medical access in all counties.  
Without available community resources for diversion , expansion of drug courts or even 
rehabilitation centers for alternate sentencing  paths that could provide targeted substance use treatment  to 
address them , counties and municipalities are powerless to stop this revolving door. This bill simply 
affirms the inten t of this  2019 MMA initiative to  protect those pre -adjudicated individuals from losing 
their much needed  health insurance and support continued substance use disorder care and possibly stop 
the revolving door.  
Additionally, it makes explicit that the Department must provide this service to county jails as 
well as the  state  prison  system  for transitional services and guarantee ind ividuals released from a county 
facility have the necessary presumptive eligibility  for nutritional and supplemental  supports on the day of 
release. These pieces, couple d with the ability to continue any substance use disorder treatment in the 
community  because they will remain insured,  are key pieces to avoiding return to the facility.   
This program will also shift the cost burden to the more appropriate revenue stream an d level the 
treatment options in all facilities . Officials ask that you honor the original intent of the 2019 initiative and 
make this pr ogram explicit for county facilities and incarcerated persons.

Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association 
In Support of 
LD 7 61, An Act To Clarijj1 and Affi,;m Medicaid Eligibility for Incarcerated Individuals
March 20, 2019 
Senator Gratwick, Representative Hymanson and esteemed members of the Health and 
Human Services Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I am testifyingin support of LD 
761, An Act To Clarify and Affirm Medicaid Eligibility for Incarcerated Individuals, on behalf of 
the Maine Municipal Association and at the direction of our 70-member Legislative Policy 
Committee who would like to thank Representative Talbot Ross for sponsoring this bill on their 
behalf.

. · Municipal officials recognize the financial benefit of maintaining health coverage for an 
individu�1 · while incarcerated as a method of reducing recidivism. Health care coverage often 
targets the root cause of incarceration in many instances such as substance use &sorder1 and 
access to.adequate mental health services.2 People in jail experience higher rates of chronic and 
acute physicalhealth conditions. compared to .the general population3 and most have no h�alth 
coverage. 
Medicaid expansion provides an oppmiunity to shifts those costs suppmied ·by primarily 
state and local programs to federal funds reducing costs at the local level. LD 761 is simply 
askingthe DepartmentofHealth and Human Services (DHHS) to maximize the allowable 
benefit for incarcerated recipients under the Affordable Care Act (ACT} and to cre�te a process 
that makes.it easier for the restricted population t6 bothapplyfor coverage and appeal decisions 
regarding their coverage. 
The costs of recid'ivism associated with untreated.mental health and substance use 
diso{ders are bori1e by local goverru,nents and society.as whole.4 Nothing under federal law

requires the termination of Medicare benefits upon incarceration. Coverage is limited to care 
received by the individual when hospitalized outside the correctional facility for more than 24 
hours. Additionally , county jails hold a number of individuals who have not been adjudicated of 
a crime. Currently , both federal and state policy does not distinguish between a convicted 
individual or a detained individual awaiting trial. While the depaiiment has testified in the past 
that it simply suspends coverage for disabled individuals, it has terminated coverage for 
individuals who have MaineCare for reasons other than disability. 
Municipal officials would like the depaiiment to change termination policy to help 
support the enormous cost for health care through the use of allowable federal funds. County 
jails currently spend an estimated $1 million on combined hospital and dental care, the majority 
of which is care for individuals with long term health needs. This approach is not unprecedented. 
Utah has created a targeted adult program with a 1115 waiver specific to justice involved 
individuals with a substance use disorder, and complying with a treatment program while 
incarcerated. County jails are filled with people who would be better served by treatment than 
incarceration. 
Additionally, municipal officials support activities that provide support �nd guidance for 
enrollment for justice involved individuals recognizing this group cannot access the traditional 
methods of communication easily and often require extra suppmi to understand their 
responsibilities within the enrollment process. Timely enrollment and access to services after 
release have the potential to greatly improve the outlook for these vulnerable individuals, reduces 
reliance on emergency depaiiments and other costly acute care settings ultimately funded by the 
local prope1iy taxpayer5• 
Connecticut is using a shortened application for inmates with identified medical or 
behavioral health needs to expedite the process of determining eligibility to make certain they 
have care on release. Recognizing that identity verification is also part of the enrollment process, 
Rhode Island has agreed to allow a 30 day ID issued by their Depaiiment of Corrections as a 
valid ID for enrollment purposes and the release letter as valid proof of income for enrollment. 
For this reason, municipal officials would like to see the depaiiment develop or suppmi 
enrollment outreach programs with county officials targeting incarcerated individuals 
paiiicularly as part of the discharge process and urge you to pass LD 761.
