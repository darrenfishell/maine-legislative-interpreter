LD 1204
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human
Services Committee:
My name is Ellen Grunblatt and I am a resident of Jay. I'm a retired physician, a 
therapist in private practice, and a member of the Franklin County Detention Center 
Board of Visitors. I'm writing in support of LD 1204, An Act to to Improve the Health
of Maine Residents by Closing Coverage Gaps in the MaineCare Program for 
Incarcerated Persons.
It is news to no one that we have a fragmented health care system underwritten by a 
patchwork of programs for health insurance, resulting in significant barriers to 
obtaining timely and often life-saving health care for Maine residents. Those barriers 
are especially evident in the correctional system, where incarcerated individuals lose 
their coverage when they need it the most. The treatment of mental illness and 
substance use disorder in jails and prisons saves lives, reduces stress among inmates 
and correctional staff and facilitates reintegration into the community after release. 
Existing correctional medical providers vary widely in the types of treatment they can
offer.  Preservation of MaineCare coverage for incarcerated individuals will ensure 
access to all approved, effective treatment options and free up county resources for 
much needed community support programs for recovery and behavioral health.  
I urge the Committee to recommend passage of this bill.
Sincerely, Ellen Grunblatt, MD, LCPC
