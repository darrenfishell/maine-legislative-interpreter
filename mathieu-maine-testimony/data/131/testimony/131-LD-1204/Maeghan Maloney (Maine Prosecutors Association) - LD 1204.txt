Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Honorable 
Members of the Health and Human Services Co, my narne is 
Maeghan Maloney, I arn the District Attorney for Kennebec and 
Somerset Counties and the President of the Maine Prosecutors 
Association (“MPA”) and I 8111 submitting this Written testimony in 
support of LD 1204 as amended, An Act to Improvethi e_He_a1th ’of 
Maine Residents by Closing Coverage Gaps inthe-MaineCa' re 
Programgforo Incarcerated Persons. 
Monday, night I had dinner with a local physician Who Works 
in a Maine county jail. She explained to me why Maine needed to 
apply for a section 1 1 15 federal Waiver for MaineCare expansion. 
She explained to me how much could be done to improve the 
continuity of care if only those who were incarcerated did not lose 
» 
their MaineCare. In her Words, by giving incarcerated people the 
tools they need for health care success, they will be more likely to 
live successful lives in our community. I agree. 
In addition, I have witnessed the ever increasing county 
budgets during my ten years as district attorney. These county 
increases are passed on to the municipalities and-paid with 
property taxes. The largest driver of county budget increases is the 
cost of medical care for people incarcerated in county jail. I know 
the property tax payers of Kennebec and Somerset counties cannot 
continue to pay these property tax increases.
This bill is the solution. This bill will single handily reduce 
property taxes across our great state. And this bill will provide 
better health care for incarcerated Mainers who will soon be living 
in our communities again. 
The MPA is grateful to Speaker Talbot—Ross for having the 
vision to introduce this bill. The MPA believes this legislation is an 
example of how We can make signiﬁcant positive changes to our 
state While relieving the property tax burden. 
Thank you for your time and I am happy to answer any 
questions. 
Sincerely, 
Maeghan Malo 
District Attorney
