LD 256
Good afternoon. I wish to testify IN FAVOR of LD256: An Act to Add Electric 
Bicycles to the Electric Vehicle Rebate Program. I have long ridden a traditional 
bicycle for work and utility trips, as well as recreation, but I recognize that the newer 
E-bike technology makes bicycle transportation more possible for more people in 
more contexts. As such, adding E-bikes to the list of electric vehicles which entitle 
their purchaser to a rebate makes at least as much sense, or even more, than providing
rebates for electric cars. E-bikes are so much more climate-friendly in all phases of 
their lifespan than any kind of car. Please recommend passage of this bill. Thank you.
