LD 256
Dear members of the EUT Committee, 
I am writing in strong support of LD 256 to add electric bikes to the electric vehicle rebate 
program. All around the country, cities and governments are finding electric bike rebates to be
enormously popular and an effective tool for providing people opportunities to drive less, 
reduce pollution, and lead healthier lives.
I run many errands on my bike but have limited range in Maine. An e-bike would 
allow me and my family to use our car less by extending our range, making easier to 
go longer distances or on hilly routes. This is especially important outside of cities in 
more rural areas.
E-bikes hold great promise for Maine as a non-polluting form of transportation in 
both rural and more urban areas. Rebate programs for e-bikes can importantly also 
give low-income residents a more cost-effective transportation method than a car 
(which is expensive to maintain and own).
Maine has a strong climate action plan but we can't limit our solutions to cars. Giving 
people the opportunity to purchase and ride e-bikes will be an effective climate 
mitigation strategy and help people lead healthier lives.
I urge you to move quickly to support this bill. Thank you for your time and service!
