LD 256
Greetings Members of the Energy, Utility and Technology Committee. My name is 
Damon Yakovleff and I am here on behalf of my family to  to urge you to vote in 
support of LD 256.
Our family purchased an ebike (a Radwagon) in 2016, and have since ridden it over 
10k miles around the Greater Portland area. The bike has the capacity to allow us to 
haul our two children and lots of additional gear to many local destinations. It serves 
as an effective car replacement, benefiting everyone in the State through reduction in 
traffic and pollution. At the same time, it provides a great deal of fun any enjoyment 
to the family.
Unfortunately, the cost of these bicycles means that they are out of reach for many 
families, a problem made only worse by recent supply chain disruptions and inflation.
Because of these issues, I would urge you to support amendments to further target 
ebike incentives to low-to-moderate income people who would use the bikes for a car 
replacement, support local bike shops to avert inflation and supply chain issues, and 
ensuring adequate funding is available. Specifically:
- Focusing the program on e-bikes for utilitarian purposes such as commuting, errands, or 
hauling cargo
- Budgeting $500,000 for the program’s operation
- Creating different levels of rebate depending on a consumer’s income
- Restricting the rebate to sales through bicycle shops to support local businesses
Thank you for your time and consideration of this issue. I hope you will support this bill and 
give more Maine people access to ebikes as a transportation option.
