Please add electric bicycles to the Electric Vehicle Rebate Program.  
1. Most car trips are under 3 miles; Studies are showing that when people own ebikes, they 
replace many local car trips with bike trips.
2. The government should incentivize bicycling in the interest of countering climate change, 
the interest of public health, and the interest of pedestrian safety. 
3. The ebike rebate has been enormously popular in Denver. Let's have Maine be a state that
leads the nation on this!
Thank you. - Jennifer Smith-Brock
