I offer personal testimony in favor of LD 256 - An Act to Add Electric Bicycles to the
Electric Vehicle Rebate Program. Much like other persuasive examples (simple acts 
of kindness, planting seeds, making meals daily, etc.) the doing of a small thing can 
be a big deal.  Including Electric Bicycles to the list of vehicles already identified is 
yet another small step that, when added to the others, may be a big help in honoring 
and protecting the treasured environment of our state, country and globe.
Several years ago, my wife purchased an Electric Bicycle. I stubbornly stayed with 
my preferred standard touring bicycle.  We have greatly enjoyed cycling together and 
she no longer laughs at me as she effortlessly passes me on the hills. This bill may 
allow me to catch up to her.
