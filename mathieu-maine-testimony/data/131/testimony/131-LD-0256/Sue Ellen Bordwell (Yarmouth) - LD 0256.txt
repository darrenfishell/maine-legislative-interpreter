Testimony in Support of LD 256
An Act to Add Electric Bicycles to the Electric Vehicle Rebate Program
Greetings members of the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology. 
My name is Sue Ellen Bordwell.  MY testimony supports  LD 256, “An Act to Add Electric 
Bicycles to the Electric Vehicle Rebate Program.” I urge the committee to issue an “ought to 
pass” report on this bill.
Why does a 77 year old woman care about this issue?  It is all about equality.  
Why should those with income enough to purchase a e-vehicle and get a rebate while those 
struggling to purchase an e-bike not be eligible for a rebate?  Both buyers are committed to the 
environment; the e-bike buyer also might be interested in saving money and a healthier 
lifestyle.
By passing LD 256, Maine is making a statement about its commitment to all economic levels 
and all transportation modes as we work toward cleaner air, less highway congestion and 
healthier lifestyles.
Again, I urge the committee to issue an “ought to pass” report LD 256.
Thank you’
