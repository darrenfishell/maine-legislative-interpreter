Testimony of Representative S. Paige Zeigler, in support of 
LD 256, An Act to Add Electric Bicycles to the Electric Vehicle Rebate 
before the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Good afternoon, Senator Lawrence and distinguished members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
committee. My nameis Paige Zeigler, and I represent District 40, consisting of the towns of Appleton, 
Islesboro, Liberty, Lincolnville, Montville, Morrill, and Searsmont. I am writing to support LD 256, An 
Act to Add Electric Bicycles to the Electric Vehicle Rebate 
I had not planned on speaking to this bill until this morning. But bicycles are far more important than 
most realize. If you read the history of the interstate highway system, you ﬁnd out that bicycles were in- 
strumental in the 1880s in developing good roads long before cars. Bicycles helped women with be- 
coming more independent as it allows for easy transportation. Bicycles around the world have helped 
with traffic logistical problems. 
That said we are at another point where bicycles are capable of being beneﬁcial to society by reducing 
our dependence on fossil fuels. And the use of batteries gives different age groups and those dealing 
with health issues more access to bicycles and an inexpensive mode of transportation, which further al- 
lows for greater distances and health beneﬁts. __ p 
You will hear the usual trope about electric vehicles as being expensive. When discussing cars, people 
often only discuss Teslas and not Chevy Bolts. Like autos, e-bikes have a wide range of prices. Ona 
personal note, I put 600 miles on my e-bike during 2020 and 300 throughout 2022. My district is a rural 
district of about 300 square miles with roads that every one of my towns complain about The bike took 
the same amount of time as a car would and saved me a lot of money. 
Supporting this legislation will reduce carbon emissions, costs of transportation and help make Mainers 
healthier overall. 
Thank you for your consideration.
