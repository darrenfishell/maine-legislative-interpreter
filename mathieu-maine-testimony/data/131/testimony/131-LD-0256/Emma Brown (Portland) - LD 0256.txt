LD 256
I am writing to offer my wholehearted support of LD 256 - An Act to Add Electric 
Bicycles to the Electric Vehicle Rebate Program. While I could wax poetic on the 
joys and merits of riding a bicycle, ultimately this is a matter of equity for Mainers 
who need affordable transit options. Owning a car is incredibly expensive - 
prohibitively so for many people. Even removing the cost of fuel (for a fully electric 
car), the cost to register, insure, and maintain a vehicle is thousands of dollars every 
year. A bike, on the other hand, can be maintained for under $500 annually and is a 
fraction of the upfront cost of purchasing a vehicle. That means that folks can keep 
more of their hard-earned money in their pockets by choosing to ride a bike, while 
also reducing congestion and wear-and-tear on our roads, as well as helping to 
mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing fossil fuel consumption. If Maine is
serious about protecting its natural resources to continue to be the Vacationland we 
know and love, then marking electric bicycles as eligible for electric vehicle rebates is
a no-brainer.
