Re: Testimony in opposition to LD 1888, “An Act To Reduce Electricity Costs for Maine’s 
Consumers and Businesses by Amending the Laws Governing Renewable Resources ” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Comerstone Government Affairs Group 
here to testify mime! in opposition to LD 1888 on behalf of our client the Maine Renewable 
Energy Association (“MREA”) 
LD 1888 aims to introduce for the first time an Altemative Compliance Payment (“ACP”) rate, 
which effectively operates as a price cap, for the so-called “Class II” market As we stated 
during our testimony for LD 399 (Representative Boyle’s legislation, which still remains m this 
conimittee ’s possession), similar to any commodity market there 1S some REC price ﬂuctuation, 
however, historically, the Class II market price has been relatively low and stable And that 
stability has again returned as we understand prices have come down to approximately $10/REC 
MREA supports directing the Public Utilities Commission (“PUC”) to establish in rule an ACP 
of no less than $10 and no more than $20 This pricing certainty helps protect the compliant 
resources ’ operational viability and also ensuring they will contmue to be around to help meet 
our policy goals 
Earlier this year Govemor Mills announced in her budget address that she is accelerating her 
commitment to move Maine to 100% renewable energy by 2040 — the Class II market plays an 
important role — in fact, 30% — in ensuring we can cost effectively achieve our goals We should 
not place in statute an artiﬁcially low ACP rate, which may cause many Class II-compliant to 
instead sell their RECs into other more lucrative markets If this were to happen and Class II 
REC supplies were to become scarce, we anticipate that more Competitive Electricity Providers 
will be left with little choice but to pay the ACP, which is clearly a suboptimal outcome 
We believe directmg the PUC to set the ACP with the appropriate pricing parameters sendsa 
clear signal these assets are valued and valuable to our clean energy future while also building in 
consiuner protections Notably, today’s ACP for the Class IA and I supply 1S $50, and the 
therma1RPS ’s ACP is $25 Each class has an important role to play in helping us cost 
effectively meet our RPS and clean energy goals

G1ven the fact there 1s already a vehicle before th1s committee to deal with th1s issue of settlng a 
Class II ACP, we would urge tlns commlttee to vote ought not to pass — and pursue any statutory 
changes w1th1n LD 399 
Thank you
