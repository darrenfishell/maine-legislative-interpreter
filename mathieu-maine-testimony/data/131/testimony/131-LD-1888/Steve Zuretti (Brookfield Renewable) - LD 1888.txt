Brookﬁeld Renewable ‘ submlts these comments 1n oppos1t1on to LD 1888 
LD 1888 dlrects the Pubhc Ut1l1t1es Commlsslon (PUC) to establlsh an Alternatlve Comphance 
Pr1ce, or pr1ce cap, on Renewable Portfoho Standard Class II Renewable Energy Credlts (RECs) 
not to exceed $5, and further dlrects the PUC to specrﬁcally rely on h1stor1cal pnces when 
establ1sh1ng th1s l1m1t Although an ACP 1s an approprlate program enhancement, conslstent w1th 
Ma1ne’s RPS Class I and Thermal RPS programs, the level at yvh1ch the ACP 1s estab11shed must 
adequately balance several factors, rncludlng pohcy goals, system rel1ab111ty cons1derat1ons and 
cost lmpacts 
Unfortunately, the ce111ng and parameters th1s b1ll establrshes overlooks broader market dynamrcs 
and, 1f 1mplemented, would make Ma1ne an outller 1n the reglon Th1s ultlmately r1sks l1m1t1ng 
supply avarlable to the Class II program as many Class II-ehglble resources w1ll mstead pursue 
markets that more adequately value the renewable energy The result could effect1vely mean 
estabhshmg a tax on ratepayers whrle 1n the process drrectly challengrng the achrevement Ma1ne’s 
lmportant clean energy goals Brookﬁeld Renewable rnstead recormnends contlnued d1SC1lSSlOI1

The Role of Class II 1n Achlevlng Rellablllty and Pollcy Requlrements 
Wlth an estabhshed requlrement of 80% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% clean energy by 
2050, Ma1ne’s Renewable Portfo110 Standard represents one of the most laudable and aggresslve 
programs 1n the country The path to ach1evmg past, current and future renewable energy goals

Throughout Mame, Brookﬁeld Renewable owns and operates 38 hydropower stat1onstotalmg>620 MW of lnstalled 
capaclty as well as 2l9MW of wmdpower and multlple battery storage fac1l1t1es, enough renewable energy to 
power nearly 500,000 homes annually Brookﬁeld Renewable has over 100 employees 1n Mame and supports 275

has relled on a senslble structure that 1ncent1v1zes new renewable energy deployment alongslde 
the retent1on of exrstrng renewable energy — much of whrch 1s sourced locally throughout Ma1ne 
Importantly, the effect of th1s sens1ble desrgn 1s a program that values and supports energy 
mdependence, local _]ObS and taxes, system rel1ab1l1ty and ratepayer costs 
For the Mame RPS Class II program, sp) ec1ﬁcally, the majorrty of the part1c1pat1ng resources are 
Ma1ne-located renewable resources that prov1de umque and cr1t1cal contr1but1ons to system 
operatlons and rel1ab111ty For example, durmg the December 2022 system shortage event, wh1ch 
occurred durmg the late afternoon and early evemng hours on Chrlstmas Eve due to colder than 
antlclpated weather and a mlx of generator outages and reduced lmport capacrty, local hydropower 
resources met 12% of system demand Notably, dunng the event hours, the contr1but1ons from 
local hydropower m0r,e than doubled the generatlon on the system from all other renewable 
resources combmed 2 S1m1lar performance was real1zed dunng the h1stor1c cold weather event the 
reglon experrenced on February 3-4, 2023, 1nclud1ng throughout dangerously cold overmght hours 
In each case, the contrlbutlons of local hydropower resulted 1n umnterrupted electrrcrty supply 1n 
Ma1ne and throughout New England, as well as the avo1dance of otherwlse h1gher wholesale 
electr1c1ty market pr1ces 
The capab1l1t1es and ava1lab1l1ty of local hydropower dur1ng cr1t1cal hours 1n recent months, and 
annually, h1ghl1ghts the value of Ma1ne’s ex1st1ng hydropower ﬂeet and the drrect beneﬁts that 
pol1c1es supportrng retent1on and local consumptlon of these resources, l1ke the Class II program, 
prov1de The ava1lab1l1ty of the Class II market and the ab1l1ty of the market to functlon m a manner 
that reﬂects the value of the part1c1pat1ng resources has been cr1t1cal to long-term capex dec1s1on- 
makmg and operatmg cormmtments that retalns these contr1but1ons to system rel1ab1l1ty 
Specrﬁcally, resource owners’ conﬁdence 1n the Class II market supports m1ll1ons of dollars of 
lnvestments annually to ensure cont1nued operatlons and trmely upkeep Th1s v1s1b1l1ty 1s 
espec1ally lmportant as more and more local Class II hydropower resources face costly and 
uncertam rehcenslng conslderatlons, 1nclud1ng the potentlal reductlon 1n fac1l1ty output to ensure 
operatlons reﬂect the latest envlromnental standards and the evolvmg needs of local stakeholders 
Dec1s1on makers must also keep 1n m1nd the cntlcal contr1but1ons of Class II resources toward 
meetrng Ma1ne’s carbon reduct1on pol1c1es, 1nclud1ng wrdespread transportatlon and bu1ld1ng 
electnﬁcatlon Rehable supply of p1'O_]6Cl6d 1ncreases 1n system demand, alongs1de aggressrve 
renewable energy requlrements, requlres an “all-of-the-above approach ” that opt1m1zes ex1st1ng 
renewable energy, rncludrng Ma1ne’s core hydropower basehne, 1n tandem w1th the add1t1on of 
new solar, w1nd and energy storage Govemor M1lls’ 2023 budget address outl1n1ng her 
connmtment to move Mame to 100% renewable energy by 2040 — and the accompanylng request 
of the Leg1slature to enact th1s requ1rement — re1nforces the cnt1cal1ty of Class II resources 
Slmply put, achlevlng renewable supply of 80% by 2030 or 100% by 2040 wrthout a robust Class 
II market (3 0% of annual electr1c1ty demand) w1ll requ1re the mstallatron of new renewable energy 
generatlon 1n volumes far exceedlng current pro] ect1ons Th1s presents umque and substantral 
challenges from a cost and resource ava1lab1l1ty perspectrve Indeed, even settmg asrde the cr1t1cal

In add1t1on to cost 1mpl1cat1ons 1s the practrcal conslderatron of the challenges to new resource

procuﬁed through pr1or Mame renewable energy solrcrtatrons and through solrcrtatrons 1n 
nerghbormg states have even sought to renegotrate power purchase agreement prrces to better» 
reﬂect /updated ﬁnancral condrtlons and project demands These setbacks reﬂect the drfﬁcultles 
that wrll contrnue to face Mame and the regron m the com1ng years and even decades on the path 
to decarbomzatron of the energy system Wh1le these challenges should not detract from the 
urgency and necesslty of expandmg relrance on renewable energy, these factors must be

Class II Market and Proposed ACP I\ 
The rncrease 1n Class II RECs prrces wrtnessed 1n recent years 1s the result of several market 
condrtrons that have rmpacted supply and demand The most notable change has been mcreased 
demand for Class II-equrvalent resources ’ due to statutory d1rect1ves 1n other states, as Well as 
growlng demand from voluntary corporate buyers wrth new or expandmg susta1nab1l1ty and carbon 
trackmg and \reduct1on pol1c1es Unfortunately, th1s b1ll would purposely rgnore th1s evolutron of 
pol1c1es and buyer preferences w1th1n and outs1de of Mame — factors that have resulted) 1n a Class 
II market that more accmately reﬂects the value of and need for Class II resources
/ \’
, 
In the absence of an ACP, Class II Rl§Cs pr1ces have remamed around $10/REC for several 
months, suggest1ng\a healthy and well-functlomng market w1th supply and demand achrevrng 
equ1l1br1um And lookmg forward, Brookﬁeld Renewable does not foresee add1t1ve market factors

A 
Renewable 1s not opposed to the adoptlon of an ACP for\ the Class II market, provlded the 
mechamsm appropnately balances the many cons1derat1ons and factors lmpacted by the program 
But LD 1888, as currently drafted, would not balance all relevant factors Indeed, by settrng an 
artrﬁclally low ACP, wlthout bonslderatlon of the broader energy and pohcy shrfts that have 
occurred, LD 1888 would establlsh Mame as an outher 1n thrs pol1cy and could r1sk the loss of 
Class II resources to other states and buyers that more approprlately value ex1st1ng renewable 
energy resources Ult1mately, thls des1gn merely creates costs to ratepayers wrthout any certarnty 
of pohcy achrevement
/ 
Brookﬁeld Renewable appreclates the opportwuty to testrfy on LD 1888, and we thank the 
C‘ omm1ttee for 1ts conslderatlon of our comments Please don’t hes1tate to ‘contact me dlrectly to
