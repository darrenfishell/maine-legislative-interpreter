Testlmony of James Bass, Soltan Bass, LLC on behalf of ecomaIne before the 
Energy, UtIlItIes, & Technology Comm|ttee In OpposItIon to LD 1888, An Act to 
Reduce Electricity Costs for Maine's Consumers and Businesses by Amending 
the Laws Governing Renewable Resources 
May 16, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, RepresentatIve ZIegler, and dIstInguIshed members of the 
JoInt Comm|ttee on Energy, UtI|ItIes, and Technology, thank you for the 
opportunIty to testIfy In opposItIon to thIs legIslatIon My name Is James Bass of 
Soltan Bass, LLC, l’m a resldent of Augusta, and l’m here on behalf of ecomalne, 
whIch Is a quasI-munIcIpa| organIzatIon wIth more than 70 member communltles 
In MaIne ecomaIne owns and operates MaIne’s largest recyclmg plant, a food 
waste recovery program, a waste-to-energy facIlIty, and a landfI|| 
Through Its mIssIon statement, ecomalne closely alIgns Its pol|c|es wIth the so|Id 
waste management hIerarchy that Is clearly deﬁned In State Statute ThIs glves all 
of us a sound plan on how to best manage waste materIals 
I strongly urge you to oppose LD 1888, An Act to Reduce Electricity Costs for 
Maine's Consumers and Businesses by Amending the Laws Governing 
Renewable Resources The consequences of thIs bI|l would be very damaglng to 
MaIne’s waste-to-energy Industry and the hundreds OfjObS that depend on the 
busInesses In It, It would create an envIronment In whIch WTE would Increase 
sIgnIfIcantly In cost, |eadIng to vastly more waste f|owIng to MaIne’s |andfIlls - the 
lowest, yet cheapest rung of the hIerarchy, It would serve to greatly upend 
MaIne’s renewable energy portfolIo at a tlme when bolsterIng the portfolIo should 
be the focus — not chIppIng away at It, and the ImmedIacy of thIs emergency 
|egIs|atIon would exacerbate market turmoIl by removIng buyers for Class ll 
RECs 
Malne Is home to three waste-to-energy plants, as well as about one dozen 
landfIlls, whIch, In total, employ hundreds of employees to operate and maintaIn 
them, IncludIng more than 40 at ecomaIne In Portland These employees are 
Malners and many are MaIne MarItIme Academy graduates, who beneﬁt from 
good-payIng j0bS In the engIneerIng ﬁeld MaIne Is fortunate to have three of 
only about 70 waste-to-energy plants In the entIre country to manage our waste In

a sustainable way LD 1888 would lead to less incoming revenue to create these 
jobs 
Waste-to-energy generates electricity - in the case of ecomaine, about 100,000 
megawatt hours of it - by combustmg Maine’s trash We are able to then sell the 
electricity, which is one of ecomaine ’s major revenue streams, alongside the 
tipping fees charged to dump trash and recyclables, and the sale of recyclable 
goods to end markets By selling electricity generated by trash, we realize 
renewable energy credits — Class ll RECs - that are a critically important part of 
Maine’s renewable energy portfolio
/ 
The revenue generated by the selling of RECs is fundamental to the operations of 
waste-to-energy plants like ecomaine ’s It helps to defray the tipping fee costs to 
our communities and their taxpayers, these costs are associated with ongoing 
maintenance of the plant, refurbishing key components that help with more 
efficient generation of this steady source of baseload power, which is an 
important part of Maine’s commitment to clean energy If LD 1888 succeeds, 
buyers of these RECs would be financially foolish to pay for RECs at $6, $7, or 
$10, when the alternative is a $5 penalty fee in lieu of purchasing a REC 
This results in less money coming into Maine’s energy producers, less revenue to 
operate, and more in tipping fee costs to Maine cities and towns And if WTE 
power plants are forced to increase prices as a result, it will become more 
expensive to push waste up the state’s solid waste hierarchy, leading to 
increased rates of landfilling at a time when our landfills are reaching capacity 
more quickly than previously anticipated At a monthly compliance cost of 68 
cents per residential customer for the Class ll RPS requirement ‘ , is it worth 
energy prices perhaps dropping very slightly, at the risk that costs associated 
with waste would increase much more significantly? We think not. \_11 
Further, by taking effect as emergency legislation, buyers would immediately 
stop purchasing Class ll RECs, currently priced at about $10, leading toa 
substantial market crash and a bottoming out of a portion of Maine’s Renewable 
Portfolio Standard

Add|t|onalIy, th|s would have sernous un|ntended consequences for the state as 
we str|ve to meet our clean energy goals - spec|f|cally the Governor ’s 2040 goal 
of 100% renewable energy To remove these sources of renewable energy would 
drive further |nstab|I|ty and create an even more uph|ll path to those goals Ata 
tlme when Ma|ne |s str|v|ng for more renewable energy, we need to ensure that 
RECs are a pr|or|ty, not an afterthought 
Lastly, Sec 2 of the b|ll proposes two new, but problemat|c, conslderatnons for 
how the PUC should set the ACP for Class ll resources 
F|rst, the PUC must cons|der “|nvestments that may affect the ava|lab|l|ty or pr|ce 
of Class II resources ” Assumlng th|s means the prlce of a Class ll RiEC, the 
market sets th|s pr|ce—not the Class ll resource or the |nvestments made to that 
resource If the |ntent |s to encourage |nvestment, then th|s may madvertently 
Increase the pr|ce of a Class ll REC m the short-term by tak|ng that resource 
offl|ne to make those mvestments In that s|tuat|on, would the PUC v|ew that asa 
]ust|f|cat|on for |ncreas|ng or decreas|ng the ACP rate?
I 
Second, the b|ll proposes the PUC to “balance the costs to ratepayers |n the State 
w|th the lnterest of Class ll resource Investors |n rece|v|ng a reasonable return on 
the|r |nvestment ” when settlng the ACP rate S|nce ecomalne IS mun|c|pa||y 
owned, |ts |nvestors are |ts owners who are the mun|c|pal|t|es In th|s s|tuat|on, 
|t’s unclear how the PUC could conduct th|s analysls 
Th|s Commlttee can create a Class II ACP that |s reasonable and that preserves 
Ma|ne’s WTE _|ObS and holds up the solld waste hlerarchy In LD 399, th|s 
Commnttee has a more strateglc, healthy approach to Class ll RECs |n the state,I 
urge you to _|Oll‘l me |n opposlng LD 1888 and focus on LD 399 as our so|ut|on to 
Ma|ne’s Class ll renewable energy credlts Thank you aga|n for the opportun|ty to 
testlfy |n oppos|t|on to th|s proposed leg|slat|on I would be happy to answer any 
questlons you may have
