This bill will have minimal effect on retail costs of electricity. 
A serious attempt to lower costs would include the complete repeal of the renewable 
energy credit program of which the ACP is a tiny part.
Maine, with over 1000-megawatt capacity wind and approaching 1000-megawatt 
capacity solar, has far exceeded all the greening of the grid that is politically and 
practically attainable without sinking the economy of household budgets.
Don't stop at one repeal of a dastardly law, repeal the RPS, RGGI, EMT, PPAs by 
PUC, NEB and wipe out all the administrative and study costs associated with these 
programs.
People are getting tired of being mocked by these feeble attempts to make it look like 
you actually have empathy towards their energy struggles. 
Over 60,000 CMP accounts received disconnection notices for non-payment and 3100
accounts have been closed thanks to the unreal price of electricity.
Stop this cruelness......Chasing Carbon Zero is Futile. C02 is the Lifeblood of 
Civilization
