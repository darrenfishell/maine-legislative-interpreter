Testimony in Support of LD 1007
An Act to Ban the Video Hosting Service TikTok on All State-owned Devices 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State
and Local Government :
My name is Nathan Gould. I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1007, “ An Act to 
Ban the Video Hosting Service TikTok on All State-owned Devices .”
The People’s Republic of China already has enough inroads that compromise our security, from
our worrying dependency on their manufacturing, to their blatant spying, to concerning relationships 
with politicians. We do not need to invite one more avenue of attack.
There have been plenty of examples of Western governments and companies intruding into 
the lives of citizens via data collection, how much more willing would China, that infamous 
surveillance state, be to spy on rival nations? Confidence in our government’s ability to protect 
important information is low enough as it is.
I find no reasonable justification for State employees to need this software on their work 
devices; let them surrender their personal data to the Chinese Communist Party on their own time, on
electronics they—not the taxpayer—paid for.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
