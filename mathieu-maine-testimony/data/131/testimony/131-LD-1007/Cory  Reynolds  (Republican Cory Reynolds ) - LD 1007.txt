Testimony in Support of LD 1007
An Act to Ban the Video Hosting Service TikTok on All State-owned Devices 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on State and Local Government:
My name is Cory Reynolds. I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1007, 
“An Act to Ban the Video Hosting Service TikTok on All State-owned Devices.” 
China 🇨🇳 has been spying on America 🇺🇸 and trying to 
destroy America. China gave us COVID-19, they sent a spy ballon to 
spy on us and probably gave us checmicals to kill us. Democrat’s 
don’t care about China spying on us and hacking us because it fits 
there agenda. before I close I just would like to include to stop 
giving money to China and Ukraine, let’s worry about America First, 
Fix America.  I ask you to please support LD - 1007. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
