Testimony of the Ofﬁce of MaineCare Services 
Department of Health and Human Services 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
3 
In Support of LD 84 
An Act to Strengthen Third-party Liability Requirements for the MaineCare Program 
Presented by: Senator Baldacci 
Hearing Date: April 18, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
and Human Services, my name is Roger Bondeson. I am the Director of the Division of Operations 
at the Office of MaineCare Services. I am here today to introduce and speak in support of LD 84, 
An Act to Strengthen Third-party Liability Requirements for the MaineCare Program. 
In March of 2022, the President signed a $1.5 trillion appropriations bill, H.R. 2471, and Omnibus 
Appropriations bill to fund the government for FY 2022. The bill included revisions to Medicaid ’s 
third-party liability (TPL) provisions. The changes require three revisions to state statutes, 
reﬂected in this LD, to: 
First, with respect to items or services for which a third party requires prior authorization, third 
parties (other than Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans, or Medicare Part D plans) must accept 
the State’s “authorization ” that the item or service is covered under the state plan “as if such 
authorization were the prior authorization made by the third party for such item or service. ” H.R. 
2471 § 202(a)(1). 
Second, add a 60-day timeliness requirement in which a third party must respond to a State’s 
inquiry about a claim. Id. § 202(a)(2)(A). The 60-day timeliness requirement is already in Title 22, 
Chapter 1, Section 14, 2-H. 
Third, requires that a third party must agree to not deny a State’s claim for failure to obtain prior 
authorization for the item or service. Id. § 202(a)(3). 
The proposed bill also establishes a two-year maximum period from the date of payment for 
insurers to seek adjustments to payments made to MaineCare. This is a recommended best practice 
to avoid incurring large refund requests in the middle of a budget cycle. 
This proposed legislation closes two loopholes: 1) The “out of state carrier loophole ” whereby an 
insurance carrier denies payment on behalf of a MaineCare member because the member receives 
a service outside of Maine; and 2) the “administrative denial loophole ” , whereby the insurance 
carrier denies payment because the State did not receive a prior approval from the insurance carrier. 
I will be happy to answer any questions you have and will plan to attend the work session.
