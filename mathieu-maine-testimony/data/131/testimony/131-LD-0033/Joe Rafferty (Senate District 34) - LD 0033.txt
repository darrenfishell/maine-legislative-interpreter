Testimony of Senator Joe Rafferty Presenting 
LD 33, An Act to Expand Access to Career and Technical Education Opportunities for Middle School Students
Before the Senate Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs
Thursday, February 9, 2023
Good afternoon Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Committee on Education and 
Cultural Affairs. My name is Joe Rafferty and I proudly represent the people of Senate District 34 
including Berwick, North Berwick, Wells, Kennebunk and Kennebunkport.
I’m here today to speak in support of LD 33 in expanding access to Career and Technical Education 
opportunities for Middle School Students. As we have frequently heard, Maine faces numerous 
challenges in providing the workforce needed throughout our businesses statewide. That is particularly 
evident in the “trades”. We’ve also considered ways to promote CTE opportunities to students at an 
earlier age.
As I understand it, this proposed legislature allows for the current Career and Technical Education 
Centers to work with Middle Schools within their service districts. LD33 allows the CTE’s to expand 
their allocation of funds that may be used for exploration programs for middle school students. This 
program got started but hindered greatly during 2020 and 21 throughout COVID.  
I’ll do my best to share my perspective but would direct questions needing greater clarity to members of 
the DOE with us today. 
Thank you for listening and I look forward to working with the committee on related issues.
Joe Rafferty
Senate District 34
