LD 33
Good afternoon,
Although I am unable to join in person or via Zoom, I wanted to share my brief 
reflections regarding LD33.
In the 2021-2022 school year, we offered our 8th graders with an opportunity to 
participate in a program that provided them with immersive exploration into our local 
CTE - Westbrook Regional Vocational Center. Four days per week, after lunch, 
students in the cohort went to WRVC. Each week, they were introduced to, and were 
able to explore, each of the programs that WRVC offers. Through this program, 
students gained independence, confidence in trying new and challenging things, and 
gained a valuable opportunity for meaningful career exploration. Students 
overwhelmingly enjoyed this experience, and their only complaint was that they 
couldn't continue this CTE experience in their freshman year.
Due to scheduling challenges, we were unable to provide this experience to our 
students this year, and it is a real loss for our community - we were enthusiastic about 
continuing the partnership and strengthening students' access to CTE.
The impact of LD33 would be to provide more students with this valuable 
opportunity, and to strengthen districts' and CTE's incentives for furthering these 
collaborations. The impact on students is powerful.
Thank you for listening to this short anecdote, and for considering this powerful 
legislation.
All the best,
