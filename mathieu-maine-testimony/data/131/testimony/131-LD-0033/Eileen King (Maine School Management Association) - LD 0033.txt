TESTIMONY NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 33  
 
AN ACT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION  
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.  I 
am Eileen King, deputy executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association , neither for nor against L.D. 33.  
 
We suppo rt the practice of giving Middle School students the opportunity to explore Career and Technical 
Education programs, but believe School Administrative Units should still have the option of providing CTE 
explorations programs on their own  and not simply b e a pass -through in terms of funding.  
 
The current process allows districts to have better control over student schedules and keeps students with their 
peers.  
 
Some districts also have done cross -walks to see how the CTE program meets learning standards . We su pport 
that practice because it allows students who can best thrive in a CTE environment to earn credits  through the 
program  once they go onto high school.  
 
Our understanding is there will or should be a fiscal note on this bill, and one estimate we were giv en was in 
the $500,000 range. It would be helpful to have a more detailed overview of the plan and the cost for 
implementing this expansion .
