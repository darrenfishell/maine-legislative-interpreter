Presented by 
Representative David Woodsome 
District 139 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee 
Thursday, February 9, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and 
distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs: 
I am State Representative David Woodsome, and I proudly represent 
District 139, Limerick, Parsonsfield, and a portion of Waterboro. 
It is an honor to appear before you today as the co—sponsor of 
L.D. 33, “An Act to Expand Access to Career and Technical Education 
Opportunities for Middle School Students. ” 
This legislation, which originates from the Maine Department of 
Education, supports the continuation of CTE exploration programs in 
middle schools. We have a robust and growing CTE system here in 
Maine, and introducing the kinds of pathways and opportunities our 
CTEs offer is an excellent way to ensure our young people continue 
to take advantage of this valuable resource. 
The Department of Education will present testimony on this 
measure, and I respectfully request that you defer any specific 
questions regarding the proposal's content to them. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. Please note that the 
forthcoming amended language also has my full support, and I look 
forward to working with you as this panel deliberates the bill's 
merits.
