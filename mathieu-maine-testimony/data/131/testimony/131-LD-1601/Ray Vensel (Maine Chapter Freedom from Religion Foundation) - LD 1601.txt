LD 1601 
 
Members of the Committee on Health and Human Services, this is testimony AGAINST LD 
1601.  
LD 1601 would, in part, allow the violation of science-based guidances issued by public health 
officials and, in the event of an infectious disease emergency, would require the passage of 
another law in order to respond in a direct way to said emergency. So if this becomes law, not 
only would it hamper the response to a public health emergency but it would slow the process by 
which that response could be implemented. Hampering the response to a public health 
emergency in a way that would make the emergency worse is simply not logical. Not verifying 
vaccination status would do that. Allowing consensual contact in all situations would do that. 
And it would affect the weakest, sickest, most immune-compromised segments of our 
population.  
Please protect Maine public health, and donâ€™t let this bill pass. Thank you.
