Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee : 
LD 712, An Act to Extend or Waive Requirements for Certain Teaching Certificates , as 
proposed would give the  Commissioner  the authority to  grant an extension of a conditional 
teaching certificate in the case of extenuating circumstances or if the applicant has a National 
Board Certification. The bill directs the State Board of Education to amend certification rules in 
Chapter 115 : The Credentialing of Education Personnel  which were last amended in the 130th 
Legislature.    
Section 1 of the bill requires the Commissioner to waive one year of student teaching if the 
applicant holds a National  Board  Certification. Currently,  a teacher holding a professional 
certificate satisfies  the student teaching requirement by completing on e year of successful 
teaching in the new certificate area .  Under this bill, an applicant could theoretically achieve 
National Board Certification in one teaching area and then use that to satisfy the teaching 
experience requirements in an entirely differe nt area. While this exemption could be reasonable 
in the case of transitioning between similar certifications, such as secondary ELA to secondary 
social studies, this exemption is drastic in terms of transitions  between dissimilar certifications 
such as  from a secondary social studies to a  282 Special Education  certification .  While the 
Department supports flexible pathways toward certification  – which may include prior work 
experience  – we believe  it is also important to ensure appropriately -qualified educators are 
teaching our students.   
Section 2 creates a new practice of extending a conditional certification in the case of 
extenuating  circumst ances.  It should be noted that at least two circumstances for certification 
extension already exist: MRS, Title 20 -A, Chapter 502 13011 -A Certification extension for 
family medical leave outlines a n extension process  by request of a superintendent ; MRS, Title 
20-A, Chapter 502 13011 outlines the powers of the Commissioner to grant certification waivers.  
Section 2 of LD 712 would create  an opening for extension for conditional certifications for 282 
Special Education and for educators without a BA, two instances which are not allowed for 
under current practice.  Further , there would be the pote ntial to  creat e a pathway for extended

conditional certification in instances that are not in alignment with federal law (for example, 
Section 1412 (a).(14) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ). 
The Department will be available to provide additional information on LD 712 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work session.    
 
 
Sincerely,
