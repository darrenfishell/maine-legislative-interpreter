Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and all other members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
My name is Dr. Wendy Chapkis; I am a Professor of Sociology at the University of 
Southern Maine where I have worked since 1995. 
I am writing to testify in strong support of LD 512 "An Act to Promote Student 
Enrollment and Degree Completion in the University of Maine System by Providing 
Tuition Waivers to Eligible Students." This is an urgently needed step for public 
higher education in the State of Maine. 
As you are undoubtedly aware, since the implementation of free community college 
tuition, the University of Maine system has been bled dry of enrollments by 1st and 
2nd  year students leading to significant enrollment declines. 
Indeed, why would anyone pay tuition to go to UMS campuses when they can do 
their first two years without cost in the community college system? 
 I am fully in support of continuing the two year free tuition at Community Colleges 
but urge you to pass LD 512 in order to extend the tuition waiver to those eligible for 
the University of Maine System.  
This is equitable. This is wise. Do not undercut the success of the University of Maine system 
campuses and the students who would wish to attend them.
