Testimony in Support of LD 271
An Act Requiring the University of Maine System and the Maine Community College System to Offer
a For-credit Course on Hunting, Fishing, Recreational Shooting and Trapping 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee On 
Education and Cultural Affairs :
My name is Nathan Gould, and I am writing this testimony in support of LD 271, “ An Act 
Requiring the University of Maine System and the Maine Community College System to Offer a For-
credit Course on Hunting, Fishing, Recreational Shooting and Trapping. ”
I have been blessed to have been raised around individuals willing to pass on their knowledge 
of hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting to me. Their influence has been positive and has instilled
an appreciation of these fundamental outdoors skills, the importance of safety surrounding these 
activities, and has fostered a fondness for these traditions so intrinsic to the character of our State. I 
also had easy access to land on which to pursue these activities.
Not everyone grew up with such resources at hand. College and University grant great 
opportunities to experience and learn those things which one might not have had the chance to 
partake in previously. I see LD 271 as a great occasion to offer to students the mentoring and 
knowledge I was privileged to enjoy. It is also important that more access to firearms safety courses be
encouraged, fostering a healthy respect for and correct familiarity with firearms.
Higher education should provide the means for a student to expand their horizons; I want 
others to have the same opportunities with which I was blessed and to enjoy and learn about the 
bountiful outdoor heritage of Maine. I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass, and I thank you for 
your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
