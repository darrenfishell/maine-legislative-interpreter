I am writing to oppose LD 672 which would create a youth hunting weekend rather 
than only one day as it is now.  The ‘one day’ is probably a Saturday, and the other 
weekend day must be a Sunday though that is not stated.  If it is a Sunday, that would 
mean hunting on a day that is currently prohibited and would represent a foot-in-the 
door approach to allow a practice that has been soundly rejected in the past.  In fact. 
there have been 39 failed attempts over the last 45 years to pass some form of Sunday 
hunting in Maine.
A 2022 survey commissioned by MDIFW revealed among other findings that only 
38% of the general public supports Sunday hunting and more than 2/3 of landowners 
oppose Sunday hunting, a clear indication that Sunday is different from the other days
in the week. It’s the one day that many landowners get to fully enjoy their land. For 
some, Sunday is also a day of worship, for most it is a day set apart to reflect and 
spend time with family.  It’s also a time for simple pleasures, perhaps a walk in the 
woods, undisturbed by those who would hunt seven days a week with little care for 
the peace and quiet of the majority of Maine's citizens.  
 It’s bills like this that continue to undermine both established hunting efforts in 
Maine and all important relationships with private land owners who provide access to 
their lands.    No Sunday hunting is a long-time Maine tradition that’s here to stay. 
Leave it alone.  Vote against LD 672.
Thank you for your time and attention.
