Patrick Strauch, Executive Director 
Good morning, Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. l’m Patrick Strauch, the Executive 
Director of the Maine Forest Products Council. Since 1961, the Maine Forest Products 
Council has represented our state’s diverse forest products community, including 
logging contractors, sawmills, paper mills, biomass energy facilities, pellet 
manufacturers, furniture manufacturers and the owners of more than eight million acres 
of commercial forestland in Maine. l am here today to speak on behalf of the Council in 
opposition to the various bills before you today regarding Sunday hunting. 
Sunday hunting has been banned in Maine since 1883. As legislators have been told 
over and over, many Mainers would like one day of the week to enjoy the Maine 
outdoors without hunters nearby. Many hunters feel the same, and even those who 
would enjoy hunting on Sunday do not want to risk unhappy landowners across the state 
posting their land. 
Last year, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife conducted a study to 
determine the desire of Mainers with regards to Sunday hunting. What they found is that 
69% of participants felt that it is important to keep one day per week during hunting 
season when non-hunters can utilize the woods. When asked about Sunday hunting 
directly, only 34% of the general population supports it while 54% opposes it. 
The survey also found that landowners who allow access today for all forms of 
recreation are more likely to post their land if hunting on Sundays is permitted. 
Maine’s landowners already provide many opportunities for recreation, especially in the north Maine woods. 
We allow use of our private road systems, and we have a minimal number of hunting leases, which are

customary in many other states. We pay a Forestry Excise Tax that covers the cost of 40% of the MFS ﬁre 
suppression expenses even though the number of ﬁres created by the visiting public has increased. We havea 
variety of public user groups, each experiencing the private forest in their own way, so, we strongly support 
preserving the tradition of no hunting on Sunday. 
The system in place has served Maine well for 138 years. For these reasons, the Maine Forest Products Council 
urges you to vote ‘Ought Not to Pass’ on LDs 626, 672, 1166 and 1241. Thank you for your consideration.
