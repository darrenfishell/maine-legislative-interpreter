Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife Committee. I am David Kent and I live in Standish. I am a member of 
Maine Farm Bureau and President of Cumberland County Farm Bureau. I am 
testifying today in gpposition to L.D. 626, L.D.1166, and L.D.1241 on behalf of 
Maine Farm Bureau. Maine Farm Bureau has had a policy for years that opposes 
all Sunday hunting. That policy was updated again at our last annual meeting in 
November 2022. Members want one day that they can safely use and enjoy their 
own land. 
This issue comes up so often that the Iegislatu re authorized Commissioner 
Camuso to do a study of all stake holders and report back to you. She gave you 
the results of that study in her testimony on L.D. 672, which was the vast majority 
of the stake holders were opposed to Sunday hunting. 
We have many riding stables in Maine and several of them offer trail rides. My 
family farm in Gorham had a riding stable and we offered trail rides. They were 
particularly popular in the Fall. These stables give up 6 days out of 7 of income 
during the hunting season. Sunday also gives one safe day for the hikers which 
has become a very popular sport, especially in the Fall. 
Many, many of our members have made it very clear that the minute Sunday 
hunting is passed, they will post their land. For those that want an extra 
opportunity to harvest deer, I suggest that they work with the vegetable growers, 
market gardeners and the department across the State. 
I'll be glad to answer any questions.
