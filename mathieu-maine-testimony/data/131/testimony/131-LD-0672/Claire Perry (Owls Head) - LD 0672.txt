 IF&W Committee Members:
I am writing in opposition to LD 672 
An Act to Establish Youth Deer Hunting Weekend
I find this bill to be particularly interesting. 
Who among you does not realize that Sunday hunting is a highly contentious issue 
here in Maine, where private property is assumed to be open year-round to complete 
strangers carrying lethal weapons ? These hunters do not have to ask permission and 
all too often, they do not. The majority of Maine hunters, hunt on privately owned 
land. 
Over the decades, it has become crystal clear that Mainers covet their hunting-free 
Sundays to enjoy their own property free of hunters and rifle shots. A more than fair 
swap. 
And yet, here we have legislators trying to get "Sunday-hunting on the books", by 
using children as the reason.  Honestly...I'm sitting on my hands here. 
OK. ~~~~> I accompanied my father hunting as a child, every Saturday I could 
manage...which was most of them. I had to make choices to do it.  I chose hunting. 
That's life. Children learn to prioritize. 
And why am I thinking that the very people who scoff at giving every child a trophy 
for participation, would be supportive of taking away a landowner's one day of 
peaceful enjoyment of their own property...because a child "wants" to go hunting.  I 
don't think so.
