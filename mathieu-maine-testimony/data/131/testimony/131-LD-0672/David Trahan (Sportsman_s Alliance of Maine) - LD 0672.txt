Testimony in Support 
LD 672, An Act to Establish Youth Deer Hunting Weekend 
LD 626, An Act to Preserve Maine’s Sporting Heritage and Enhance Sporting 
Opportunities for Maine’s Youth to Hunt on Sunday 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
Presented by David Trahan, Executive Director of the SAM-Institute for Legislative 
Action 
Monday, April 10, 2023 
Senator LaFontaine, Representative Landry, members of the Inland Fisheries and 
Wildlife Committee my name is David Trahan and I am testifying in support of LD 
672, An Act to Establish Youth Deer Hunting Weekend. LD 626, An Act to 
Preserve Maine ’s Sporting Heritage and Enhance Sporting Opportunities for 
Maine ’s Youth to Hunt on Sunday 
We understand any policy that creates a Sunday hunting weekend is going to be 
met with stiff opposition. 
We believe Youth weekend would be more accepted by the general public and 
some landowners. Youth Day is a much more structured hunt, as an adult is 
required to be in the presence of the young hunter. Just a week ago this committee
heard legislation to require hunter orange on youth day and What we learned during 
that public hearing is there are people in the woods wearing camo, hunting turkey 
and archery hunting for deer, as well as hunting bear and grouse. In public 
testimony, it was revealed there has not been a single incident or a problem around 
public or hunter safety. 
In closing, in a recent poll of SAM membership, a limited small game Sunday hunt 
in the unorganized territories had the most support. If the committee so chose, it 
could narrow one of these two these two bills even further to do a pilot youth day 
hunt for small game in the unorganized territories on the ﬁrst Weekend of grouse 
season.
