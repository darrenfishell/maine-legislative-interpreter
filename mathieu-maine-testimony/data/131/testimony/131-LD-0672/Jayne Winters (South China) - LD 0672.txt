Testimony in OPPOSITION  
of LD 672, “An Act to E stablish Youth Deer Hunting Weekend ”  
 
Before the Committee on Inland Fisheries & Wildlife  
Presented by  Jayne Winters, South China, ME  
 
March 27, 2023  
 
Senator LaFountain , Representative  Landry , distinguished members of the Inland Fisheries & 
Wildlife  Committee, my name is Jayne Winters. I have lived in Maine all my life and currently 
reside in South China; my family  also maintain s a seasonal home in northern Maine . I am 
submitting comments in OPPOSITION  of LD 672, “An Act  to Establish Youth Deer Hunting 
Weekend.”   
 
My reason for opposition is simple: establishing a weekend for youth hunting would obviously 
include Sunday. The debate about Sunday hunting is decades long and I’m sure you’ve heard 
all the arguments from both sides. I won’t repeat them here.  
 
I am not an ti-hunting. My husband and several friends have hunted deer and birds for years. I 
am, however,  tired of this on -going push to deny Maine rs and visitors this one day a week to 
safely enjoy recreational time spent  outside  in this beautiful state without the  worry or fear of a 
misplaced bullet or arrow.  More than 2/3 of property owners oppose Sunday hunting. Enough 
already.  
 
As yet another trade -off, I would SUPPORT LD 482, “An Act to Extend the Time for Youth Deer 
Hunting” which would establish a six -day you th hunting period to begin a week before the 
regular hunting season. Six days, not seven.  
 
I respectfully urge you to vote “Ought Not to Pass” on LD 672 so that the majority of the 
general , also tax -paying , public be permitted  to have Sunday as a day to participate in non -
hunting activities  with friends and family without apprehension  or concern . Thank you  for your 
consideration . Respectfully, Jayne Winters
