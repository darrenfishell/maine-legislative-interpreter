Esteemed Committee Members,
My name is Ron Greco and I run Moose Maine Kids.  MMK is a 501c3 non-profit with a sole 
goal of increasing youth participation rates in traditional outdoor activities like hunting and 
fishing.  We strongly support LD 672.
LD 672 creates a full weekend for youths to hunt for deer before the start of the regular firearms 
season for deer.  Youth are particularly challenged by Maine’s Sunday hunting ban and are often 
pushed out of the woods by an inability to find time to hunt.  This is a great step in finding an 
equitable way to give youth’s a greater chance to participate in our long hunting heritage.
Sincerely,
Ron Greco
Executive Director, Moose Maine Kids
