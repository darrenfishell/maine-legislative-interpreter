LD 903
I am writing to voice my support for LD 903.  What I appreciate about this bill is it 
doesn't mandate changes in the tip policy for restaurants that don't choose to take this 
path.  Changes to the tip policy may not work for every food service business-- but 
this bill gives us the choice.  As small, independent restaurant owners dealing with a 
housing crisis and a labor shortage, we need every tool available to us to remain a 
competitive choice for employment.  Bill LD 903 gives us one more tool to work 
with.  I would also like to point out that having State and Federal policy align makes 
navigating the law much less confusing for us.  Thank you for your consideration!
