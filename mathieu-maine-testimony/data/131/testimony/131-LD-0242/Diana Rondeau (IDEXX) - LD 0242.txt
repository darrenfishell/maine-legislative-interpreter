Testimony in Support of LD 242, An Act to Clarify That Animal Health Products Are 
Exempt from the Perﬂuoroalkyl and Polyﬂuoroalkyl Substances Reporting Law 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, Members of the Committee: 
My name is Diana Rondeau. I am the Director of Product Compliance at IDEXX Laboratories 
and reside in Raymond. I am here today on behalf of IDEXX in support of LD 242. 
Allow me to thank the Committee and the State for your engagement with the global effort 
to eliminate the use of PFAS substances. IDEXX is committed to reducing harm to people, 
animals, and our environment through our diagnostic products, services, and our business 
processes, as highlighted in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report available on our 
website. 
As you may know, lDEXX’s global headquarters are here in l\/laine, where approximately 
90% of our worldwide manufacturing and R&D occurs. IDEXX manufactures human, animal 
(pet and livestock), dairy, and water diagnostic products. Our products test for infectious 
diseases, including those that spread from animals to humans such as SARS Corona Virus 2, 
and that endanger the food supply, such as African Swine Fever. Our diagnostic solutions 
help animal producers manage vaccination programs more efficiently and reduce the use of 
antibiotics. 
These critical diagnostic tests used to keep our pets, food and water safe are subject to 
stringent regulatory frameworks around the world. Accordingly, they are not easily 
changed. As one example, the IDEXX diagnostic kit used to test for mad cow disease is 
written into EU laws. Changes to many of our products require approval of regulatory 
agencies both in the US and abroad. In general, to change the components of a test we 
need between 1—5 years to test feasibility, validate product performance, and determining 
product stability. 
Unfortunately, our ability to identify PFAS in our diagnostic products is limited to currently 
available test methods. These are developed only in response to national regulations, such 
as the pending EPA and EU-wide requirements. This means that while Maine’s legislation 
calls for identifying all ofthe more than 9000 PFAS compounds, right now internationally 
recognized labs offer screening tests for about 70 recognized compounds, based on EU

regulatory lists. Current Maine legislation simply does not account for these practical 
limitations in PFAS testing capability. 
Because of these practical complexities, the EU has recently proposed delaying certain 
aspects of its PFAS regulatory program for laboratory diagnostics so as not to put human 
and animal safety at risk. LD 242 brings Maine into alignment with that practical approach. 
None of lDEXX’s manufacturing processes involve intentionally added PFAS 
compounds. So, we are dependent on testing products and their components or 
gathering PFAS information from our suppliers. However, both we and our suppliers 
remain dependent on current, limited test methods and are further constrained by 
limited global supplier awareness of the |\/laine statute. But consumers in Maine 
deserve no interruption in the supply of products that are essential to their health and 
well-being. Accordingly, we encourage the Committee to consider exempting critical 
human and animal diagnostic products such as ours. Other regulatory bodies such as 
the US EPA and EU are addressing the PFAS issue while also working to make sure that 
critical products remain available to protect our food and water supply. 
As such, while we support LD 242 we also recommend following the EU's approach of 
exempting, or at least considering delays, for all critical diagnostic testing products. 
Thank you, and I would be happy to answer any questions.
