ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
DATE OF HEARING: 
February 14, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Mark 
Margerum, Policy Development Specialist in the Office of the Commissioner at the 
Department of Environmental Protection. I am speaking in opposition to L.D. 242. 
This proposal would amend the provisions of LD 1503, An Act To Stop Perfluoroalkyl 
and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Pollution, adopted in the first session of the 130"‘ 
Legislature. In addition to prohibiting the sale of carpets, rugs and fabric treatments 
with intentionally added PFAS, effective January 1, 2023, LD 1503 created a reporting 
program for all products sold in Maine with intentionally added PFAS. The goal of the 
reporting program is to help us understand PFAS inputs to the Maine environment,

LD 242, An Act to Clarify That Animal Health Products Are Exempt from the Perfluoroalkyl and 
Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Reporting Law 
Written Testimony of: Mark Margerum/DEP

whether it be through wastewater discharges, disposal of PFAS containing products, or 
other pathways. 
LD 242 would exempt various veterinary products from the reporting program 
established in LD 1503. The bill provides that certain veterinary health products that are 
regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the federal Virus-Serum- 
Toxin Act or the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act would be exempt 
from reporting. 
The Department has no information at this time from which to judge whether these 
products are a signiﬁcant source of PFAS to Maine’s waste stream and environment. 
We do understand there are concerns that the reporting program may add costs and 
potentially impede the delivery of important healthcare products for both animals and 
humans. The original legislation provides a process whereby the Department, through 
major substantive rulemaking, can designate products as “Essential for Health, Safety, 
or the Functioning of Society” . The Department does not have sufficient information 
about veterinary products to make that determination at this time, but potentially could 
review the issue in a future major substantive rulemaking to be brought back to this 
Committee for its consideration. 
l would be happy to answer any questions you have, now, or at the work session. 
Thank you.
