LD 1959 - An Act Regarding Open Primary Elections and Ranked-choice 
LINDA HASKELL, GARLAND, Maine, OUGHT NOT TO PASS, This is an       
Act that has no place in this administration. This Democratic administration is an 
example of the fraudulent principles that are flying thru the State Government. It is 
time to take our government back. I oppose this act.
