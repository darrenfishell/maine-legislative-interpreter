Date: Sun, May 21, 2023 1:28 pm 
The Honorable Craig Hickman 
The Honorable Laura Supica, Co-Chairs 
Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Thank you. I'm Joe Pickering Jr. from Bangor a Veteran, a Republican and former 
Democrat representing Mainers for Open Elections. We totally support Senator Joe 
Baldacci's LD 1959 a Top 4 with RCV bill. It gives greater freedom and more 
candidate choice to the voter and hopefully to the public who currently refrain from 
voting which is tragic. 77,000,000 did NOT vote in the 2020 Presidential Elections! 
Afew days ago, I got a written message: THIS PERSON CARED ENOUGH 
ABOUT THE MAINE VOTING SYSTEM TO RESPOND RESPONSIBLYII She 
politely wrote: "Didn't want to post something negative on your profile about ranked 
choice. It was a disaster in local Portland voting. Because of this - I simply cannot 
support. The only fair way to do ranked choice voting is to put EVERYONE on the 
ballot and not by political party." 
My response to her: THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS. 
EVERYONE ON THE BALLOT AND NOT BY POLITICAL PARTY. That is whata 
Top Four Open Primary Does with RCV! It includes everyone does not exclude 
anyone. Our parties participate in this TRUE open primary AKA as Nonpartisan but 
do NOT own this public election system. (Just like all the local elections in Maine) It 
is modeled after Alaska's Top 4 with RCV. Alaska borrows Maine's RCV. And maybe 
even what the Bangor Chapter of the League of Women Mainers did in 2017. That 
chapter recommend a Top 4 primary with RCV. First in the nation to do so! 
I served in the U.S. Air Force during the Berlin Crisis and went to visit the over 
5,100 Americans buried in Luxembourg including General Patton. I don't believe 
any one of them gave up their lives for WE THE PARTY BUT FOR WE THE 
PEOPLE. PLEASE MEMBERS OF THE VETERAN'S AND LEGAL AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEE you took an oath to our Constitution. Shouldn't that include giving 
more Voter Freedom? Please VOTE FOR LD 1959. Thank you. (Further
