Not sure why this is open now.  I think this opens the primary to manipulation.  Big 
time.
I am VEHEMENTLY opposed to RCV.  It is cheating.  People get to vote miltiple 
times.  That is unconstitutional.
One person, one vote.
And the loser always ends up winning.  If there r more than 2 candidates running, 
there is a very good chance there will not b a majority winner. And yet, people  
complain that there r only 2 parties.  Pls kill this bill.
