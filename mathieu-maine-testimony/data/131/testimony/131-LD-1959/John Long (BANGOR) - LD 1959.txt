 
 Dear members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee.I am a retired physician and a veteran who 
served in the US Army during the Vietnam war. I liven in Bangor. I would like to lend my voice in full 
support of LD1959. 
 
Each of you are members of a political party. In general you agree with the major tenants of your party.  
Understandably, you feel a significant degree of loyalty to your party but your party did not elect you and 
your primary loyalty should be to those people in your community who did. You serve the people first 
and not the party. 
 
Especially at the national level, how well have the parties been doing? Could there be a better system, one 
not excluding the major political parties but not controlled by them, a system where the elected individual 
represents the will of the majority of the voting population?  
I ask you to support LD 1959 because it does just that. 
 
You know the answer to my question. The two candidates put fourth by the two major parties are both 
flawed. There must be better options. We must be able to find better candidates for the top elected offices 
of our country.  
 
If an open primary election process allows all qualified candidates to run and the top four face off in rank 
choice voting format. 
 
Thank you Senator Baldacci  for having the fortitude to bring forth this LD.
