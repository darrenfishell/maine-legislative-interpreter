Testimonial in Support of LD 1810 
 
I, Erika Dube, citizen of Saco, ME, am writing in support of LD 1810, An Act to Expand 
the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit.   
As a lifelong resident of Saco, I also serve as Deputy Director for the Saco Parks and 
Recreation Department.  We, as a municipal department, often partner with our local 
Main Street non-profit organization to provide community events in the downtown area, 
which is adjacent to the majority of Saco’s Historical District.   
While some of these homes have been maintained, others have visibly fallen into 
disrepair.  Dilapidated fencing, peeling paint, missing siding, broken windows, and lost 
ornamental features are common themes for these buildings.  Most of these homes are 
prominently located in the downtown area with visitors frequently wondering what can 
be down to support renovation efforts.  For many homeowners, these conditions are the 
result of costly historic preservation requirements to restore the building.   
LD 1810 would give support to homeowners investing in exterior repairs for their 
homes.  This bill has the potential to provide a transformational experience for Maine 
communities.  So many older buildings throughout Maine are being repurposed and 
reclaimed, providing a renaissance in many downtowns; we’ve seen this successfully 
done with mill buildings in Biddeford and in Millinocket.  This bill could contribute to 
downtown revitalization efforts by supporting homeowners and providing some 
financial relief to restore historic homes to their original glory, adding to the overall 
aesthetic of the community, and preserving Maine’s rich architectural and cultural 
history. 
Thank you for your support, 
Erika J. Dube, Deputy Director Saco Parks and Recreation
