Re:  Support of LD 1810 – Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits  
 
The BDA strongly supports bill LD1810 which provides owners of historic homes with a 25% 
credit on costs incurred to restore or rehabilitate exterior elements, including weatherization. 
The bill contains a 5% booster if the property includes an affordable apartment, makes a vacant 
property habitable, or if the owners are low-income. This program, administered by the Maine 
Historic Preservation Commission and claimed on Maine tax returns falls in line with the work 
of Main Street communities who are fierce champions of historic preservation. 
 
Legislation that provides incentives to commercial and residential property owners to 
rehabilitate their historic properties is urgently needed in the state of Maine.  
 
We urge the Taxation Committee to support this bill.  Thank you for considering our thoughts.  
  
Sincerely,
