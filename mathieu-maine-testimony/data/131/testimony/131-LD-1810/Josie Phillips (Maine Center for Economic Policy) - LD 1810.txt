Testimony in support of LD 1810 , “An Act to Expand the Maine Historic Rehabilitation 
Credit and Establish a Weatherization Tax Credit .” 
Josie Phillips,  Policy Fellow  
5/09/2023  
 
Good morning, chairpersons Grohoski and Perry, and all members of the Taxation committee. 
My name is Josie Phillips, and I’m representing Maine Center for Economic Policy. I am 
testifying in favor of LD 1810 because the Historic Rehabilitation Credit is a cost -effective way to 
preserve and produce affordable h ousing, of which the state is experiencing a critical shortage. 
This shortage urgently needs addressing, as it is hurting the health and financial stability of 
Mainers with low and moderate incomes and impeding businesses’ ability to attract workers into 
the state.  
 
Over the past 20 years, the costs of homeownership in Maine and renting in the Northeast 
region have grown more quickly than Mainers’ median household income.i ii This indicates that, 
for a majority of Mainers who rent or are looking for a new home, keeping a roof over their head 
has consistently become more challenging over time. At this point, Maine is experiencing a 
shortage of  between 20,00 0-25,000 affordable housing units across the state .iii 
 
Maine’s  lack of affordable housing is hurting our economy. The state economist has 
acknowledged it as one of the most significant challenges facing Maine’s economy, particularly 
in relation to the difficulty it adds to attracting working age adults into the state.iv Even when 
solely considering the residents already in Maine, however, a lack of affordable housing can be 
a serious impediment to the wellbeing of families’ personal finances and the prosperity of 
Maine’s state economy.   Experiencing housing instability t hreatens people’s physical and 
mental health, which can severely impact lifetime earnings, and increases the likelihood of 
becoming unemployed.v vi 
 
Maine’s Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit has already proven itself a powerful tool to preserve 
and incre ase the stock of affordable housing across the state. An OPEGA review of the tax 
credit found that between 2008 and early 2021, the tax credit contributed to the creation of 924 
affordable housing units and the preservation of 362 additional affordable units.vii The entirety of 
the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit cost approximately $8 million in Fiscal Year 2022 .viii 
Applying this annual cost retroactively to the time period of 2008 -2021, this would come out to a 
cost of approximately $113,000 per unit created, or $81,000 per unit created or preserved. At a 
time when affordable housing development can cost multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars 
per unit, this credit represents a cost -effective tool to meet Maine’s housing production goals.   
 
By increa sing the value of the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, particularly the section of the 
credit that deals with affordable housing, LD 1810 would further bolster the credit’s ability to 
increase the stock of affordable housing in Maine. Because this bill efficiently addresses the 
affordable housing crisis that is hurting the stability of Mainers with low and moderate incomes, 
as well as the entire state economy, we encourage this committee to vote yes on LD 1810.
