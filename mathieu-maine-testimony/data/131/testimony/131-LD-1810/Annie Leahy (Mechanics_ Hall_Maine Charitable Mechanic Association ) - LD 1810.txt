Dear
Members
of
the
Maine
State
Legislatur e,
W e
ar e
writing
t o
expr ess
our
suppor t
for
the
expansion
of
Maine ' s
Hist oric
Rehabilitation
T ax
Cr edit,
as
outlined
in
LD
1810,
on
behalf
of
Mechanics'
Hall
and
the
Maine
Charitable
Mechanics
Association.
As
an
or ganization
founded
b y
tr adespeople
and
ar chitects,
we
understand
the
impor tance
of
pr eser ving
Maine ' s
hist oric
buildings
and
belie v e
that
it
is
crucial
for
the
state ' s
economy .
Our
landmark
building
at
519
Congr ess
Str eet
in
P or tland,
with
its
unique
ar chitectur e,
has
been
a
tr easur ed
space
for
ar tists
and
the
wider
community .
It
off ers
affor dable
facilities
for
the
pr actice
and
per formance
of
music,
dance,
and
liter ar y
ar ts,
and
is
an
ex cellent
example
of
the
kind
of
hist oric
building
that
is
no
longer
constructed
t oda y .
Howe v er ,
maintaining
and
upgr ading
these
buildings
can
be
an
expensiv e
under taking,
especially
when
it
comes
t o
ensuring
the y
ar e
ener gy-eﬃcient.
W e
belie v e
that
LD
1810
will
be
a
v aluable
t ool
for
pr eser ving
these
irr eplaceable
structur es.
By
expanding
Maine ' s
Hist oric
Rehabilitation
T ax
Cr edit,
the
state
can
encour age
inv estment
in
the
r est or ation
and
maintenance
of
these
hist oric
buildings,
pr omoting
economic
gr owth
while
saf eguar ding
Maine ' s
rich
ar chitectur al
heritage.
Thank
y ou
for
considering
our
suppor t
for
LD
1810
and
for
y our
ongoing
commitment
t o
the
pr eser v ation
of
Maine ' s
hist oric
