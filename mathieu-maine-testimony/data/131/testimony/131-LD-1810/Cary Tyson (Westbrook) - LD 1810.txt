LD 1810
Honorable Members of the Taxation Committee: 
I urge your support of LD 1810 which will provide owners of historic homes a 25% 
credit on costs incurred to restore or rehabilitate exterior elements, including 
weatherization. The bill contains a 5% booster if the property includes an affordable 
apartment, makes a vacant property habitable, or if the owners are low-income. The 
program would be administered by the Maine Historic Preservation Commission and 
claimed on Maine tax returns.
The same bill will improve the "small deal" tax credit for smaller commercial projects
by increasing the credit to 30% (and up to 45% for affordable housing) and by raising 
the ceiling of eligible expenses from $250K to $1M. Maine's Office of Program 
Evaluation & Government Accountability (OPEGA) singled the program out for 
improvements. The small-deal credit is for your typical Main Street-style building and
has been virtually unused for 15 years because of how it was structured. We want to 
put it to work! 
We face a housing crisis in Maine. We need every tool in the toolbelt to help turn this 
around. This is a particularly good & proven tool. 
Thank you,
Cary Tyson
