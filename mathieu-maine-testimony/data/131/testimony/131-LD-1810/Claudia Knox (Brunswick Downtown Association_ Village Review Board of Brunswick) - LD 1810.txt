LD 1810
Dear Legislators, I urge you to support LD1810, a bill I believe can have significant 
positive impact on every Maine community and downtown.  Costs for maintenance of
historic buildings, be they commercial structures on Main Streets, or residential 
structures on the side streets of towns and villages, is burdensome to many owners.   
The fate of major downtown streets and the surrounding neighborhoods is closely 
linked - they are dependent upon each other.  LD1810 will help communities thrive, 
preserving historic buildings and increasing the availability of decent housing.  This 
bill's investment in Maine's built infrastructure will pay big dividends in economic 
well-being across the state.
