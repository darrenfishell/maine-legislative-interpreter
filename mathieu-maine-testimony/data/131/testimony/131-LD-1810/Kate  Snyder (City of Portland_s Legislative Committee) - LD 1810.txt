Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry ,
and
Honorable
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
T axation:
I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portland’ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
support
of
LD
1810.
The
preservation
and
rehabilitation
of
significant
and
beloved
historic
buildings
across
Portland
has
been
an
important
goal
of
the
city
since
the
establishment
of
the
local
preservation
ordinance
in
1990.
Existing
rehabilitation
tax
credit
programs
have
been
powerful
tools
in
achieving
those
goals
by
fueling
significant
projects,
such
as
the
conversion
of
Mercy
Hospital
and
Sisters
of
Mercy
Motherhouse
to
housing.
In
many
instances,
these
projects
have
been
paired
with
the
creation
of
af fordable
housing
units.
Statewide,
historic
tax
credit
programs
have
helped
support
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
construction,
rehabilitation,
and
investment
in
Maine
and
Maine
jobs.
The
proposed
bill
would
support
a
number
of
stated
goals
in
Portland’ s
Comprehensive
Plan,
including
encouraging
investment
in
historic
structures,
improved
accessibility ,
improved
ener gy
ef ficiency ,
climate
change
adaptation,
and
promoting
sustainability
by
supporting
rehabilitation
of
our
existing
housing
stock.
In
particular ,
we
appreciate
the
attention
that
has
been
given
to
ensuring
that
this
new
program
would
pair
with
existing
financial
incentives,
such
as
Ef ficiency
Maine’ s
programs
for
weatherization.
Additionally ,
LD
1810
would
help
realize
the
potential
of
the
combination
of
Historic
Preservation
and
af fordable
housing,
both
increasing
support
for
lar ge
projects
and
creating
incentives
for
smaller -scale
af fordable
housing
in
owner -occupied
historic
structures.
Providing
incentives
for
the
creative
use
of
our
existing
building
stock
is
one
crucial
component
of
removing
obstacles
to
housing
creation.

W e
also
expect
that
the
bill
will
provide
expanded
and
new
incentives
across
Portland
by
supporting
property
owners
in
maintaining
and
retaining
their
homes.
This
is
a
critical
measure
that
will
help
to
ensure
vulnerable
individuals
and
families
have
access
to
the
basic
necessities
they
need
to
survive
and
thrive.
Thank
you
for
your
attention
to
this
important
matter .
