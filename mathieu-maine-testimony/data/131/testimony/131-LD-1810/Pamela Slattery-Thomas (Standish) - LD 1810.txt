Pamela Slattery-Thomas
Standish
LD 1810
Dear Taxation Committee chairpersons and members:
     My name is Pamela Slattery-Thomas, and I live in Standish, Maine.  
I would like to show my support of LD1810, and urge you to do the same at 
tomorrow's (May 9) hearing.
     As a descendant of several prominent Standish families, as well as a lifetime 
resident myself, I have seen the Town go from rightful pride in its history and the 
buildings which housed so much of the same, to the rash of burning (by 
firemen/women for training purposes), tearing down and otherwise disrespectful 
actions which can never be replaced.
     The passage of this bill could be a win-win for all with its financial incentives.
    Thank you very much for considering my testimony.  I look forward to celebrating 
the success of the bill as it passes your votes.
    Sincerely,
        Pamela Slattery-Thomas
