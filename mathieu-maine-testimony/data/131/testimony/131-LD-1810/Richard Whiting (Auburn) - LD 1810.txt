Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry & Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Taxation:
I write in support of L.D. 1810, An Act to Expand the Maine Historic Rehabilitation 
Credit and Establish a Weatherization Tax Credit, which will encourage homeowners 
and small businesses to reinvest in their historic properties throughout the state and 
help revitalize neighborhoods. It will also stimulate the development of badly needed 
new housing units, create new jobs, and offer a significant net gain in tax revenues 
through increased local property taxes.
When I think of this legislation, my mind turns immediately to Strathglass Park in 
Rumford, a planned community of beautiful historic brick one and two family homes 
from the early 1900's, which would benefit TREMENDOUSLY from the increased 
attention and investment L.D. 1810 offers. As a city councilor in Auburn, I foresee a 
renaissance here of rehabilitation in historic homes in need of it, and a ripple effect 
where more & more homeowners feel  encouraged to reinvest because their neighbors
are doing so.
I urge you to support of this bill, which will have significant positive impact 
throughout the state.
