Re: Statement in Support of LD1810: An Act to Expan d the Maine Historic Rehabilitation Credit and Esta blish a 
Weatherization Tax Credit 
Dear Members of the Joint Taxation Committee, 
My name is Margaret Innes. I am an historic Archite ct practicing in my own firm in Westbrook, Maine.   I write to you today in support of LD 
1810.  
As you may already know, Historic Tax credit progra ms are very successful in Maine and the rest of the  country. From 2009-2019, the 
present tax credits generated $525 million in const ruction investment and generated 200-700 full-time- equivalent jobs! But also very 
importantly, we’ve rehabilitated 3.6 million square  feet of existing building stock. With materials co sts climbing we need to take advantage 
of what we already have. This is a winning way to d o this.  
As the saying goes, “the greenest building is the o ne already built.” By assisting those who want to r ehabilitate existing buildings we are also 
making a sustainable choice.  
Lastly, by fixing up our older, residential housing  stock we are enhancing our sense of place to visit ors and residents alike. Part of our “the 
way life should be” appeal is found in the experien ce of shopping in a small downtown, like Norway’s M ain Street or strolling through a 
neighborhood like Portland’s west end and our belov ed Old Port. Buildings like the former Hathaway Shi rt Mill are vibrant contributors to 
their communities in an entirely different manner t han when they were first built – but still part of our business community.  
Please vote in support of LD 1810. Thank you for yo ur attention to this matter. 
Sincerely, 
 
Margaret D. Innes
