LD 1810
Chairman Chapman and Members of the Committee on Taxation,  I would like to 
urge your support for LD1810, a bill to expand the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit.
I have been involved with historic preservation since working at the National Register
of Historic Places from 1975 to 1982.  I spent 5 years there establishing the 
regulations and procedures that govern the federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit. 
When I moved to Maine in 2005, I was very interested to learn about Maine's 
Rehabilitation Tax Credit.  I have seen from statistics maintained by the Maine 
Historic Preservation Commission what an effective incentive toward reuse and 
revitalization of Maine's communities the Rehabilitation Tax Credit has been for this 
state.  I am excited that this incentive would be extended to homeowners in LD1810 
and that other provisions would strengthen the effectiveness for the use of the 
Rehabilitation Tax Credit for income producing properties as well.  Thank you for 
your efforts on behalf of our wonderful state!  Again, I strongly urge your support for 
LD1810.
