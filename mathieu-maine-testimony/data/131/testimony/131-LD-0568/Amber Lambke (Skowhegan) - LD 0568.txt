Dear Legislators, 
I urge you to support nutrition incentive programs, like Maine Harvest Bucks, that 
boost small business viability and rural economies.
Please vote for funding that is continuous (ongoing) at the $600,000 per year 
allocation.
The Skowhegan Farmer's Market was among the first in the state to democratize the currency
accepted at farmer's markets by buying our very own EBT processing machine and accepting
SNAP benefits for fresh food. 
We committed early on to the notion that fresh local food is not just for people who can pay 
with cash or credit, it is for everyone.  We have worked hard to make the farmer's market a 
welcoming place for all, and EBT purchases now comprise 30% of all Skowhegan market 
sales.  Nutrition incentives like Maine Harvest Bucks have helped to incentivize EBT spending
at farmers markets in a win-win-win scenario that puts SNAP dollars into farmer's pockets 
helping the Maine economy and improving the health and well being of families.
Over 200 Maine farmers and food producers benefit 
Every $1 of state support yields $2 from the federal government
In 2021 there were over $1.2 million in EBT sales to Maine producers
Nutrition incentive programs benefit Mainers in all 16 counties
Over 10,000 Maine households benefit each year
Thank you for your support,
