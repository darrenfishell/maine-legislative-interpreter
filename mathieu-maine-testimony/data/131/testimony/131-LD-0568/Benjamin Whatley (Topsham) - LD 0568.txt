I am an owner of Whatley Farm in Topsham, and we have served SNAP customers 
through the Maine Harvest Bucks program since 2016. We feel it is important for the 
State of Maine to support the nutrition assistance programs with stable, long-term 
funding. The households that we serve frequently express their appreciation that we 
participate in the program, because it helps them to stretch their food dollars and put 
healthy, high-quality food on the table.  It helps us as farmers to reach more 
customers, and many of them who discover us through the nutrition-assistance 
programs continue to be customers even after they no longer need benefits. It 
strengthens the community by knitting us all together and keeping money circulating 
locally.
