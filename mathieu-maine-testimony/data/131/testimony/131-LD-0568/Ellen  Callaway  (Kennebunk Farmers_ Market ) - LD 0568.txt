LD 568
Testimony of Ellen Callaway of Kennebunk, Maine before the 131st Legislatureâ€™s 
Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry
Good afternoon members of the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation, and Forestry. 
My name is Ellen Callaway, I am a resident of Kennebunk, Maine, and I am here 
today as Kennebunk Farmers' Market Manager to express my support of LD 5688 - 
An Act to Provide Funding for the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and Provide 
Nutrition Incentives. 
I have made many transactions for people in need that rely on the MHB program. One
woman has 4 kids and a husband that is diagnosed with cancer. Her kids are happy 
and healthy because of the program and her will to provide them with a solid 
childhood. The program also helps support our local economy by providing sales for 
our farmers. Without this program, these families in need would not be able to shop 
here and our farmers would have fewer sales.
