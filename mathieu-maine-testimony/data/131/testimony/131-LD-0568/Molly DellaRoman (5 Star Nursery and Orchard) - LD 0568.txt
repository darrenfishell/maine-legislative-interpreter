Testimony of Molly DellaRoman of Brooklin before the 131st Legislatureâ€™s Joint 
Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry
Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and 
Forestry,
My name is Molly DellaRoman, I am a farmer in Brooklin and I am supplying written
testimony today as the co-owner and operator of a MOFGA-certified organic orchard 
with my partner, Timothy Skillin.  We are expressing support of LD 568 - An Act to 
Provide Funding for the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and Provide Nutrition 
Incentives. 
We first became involved with a farmers market that was setup to accept SNAP, 
Maine Harvest Bucks and Farm Fresh Rewards at the Rockland Farmers Market in 
2021.  This was our first market experience where these vital services were available 
and realized very quickly what an inclusive and more robust market experience it was
for all community members.  There were multiple market days that Maine Harvest 
Bucks provided 50% of our sales (kids love fruit!!).  It's not hard at all to understand 
how this program not only makes our entire community more healthy but is a 
tremendous support to local farmers and therefore our local economy.  This year, 
another one of our farmers markets, Blue Hill, started accepting SNAP/EBT and 
Maine Harvest Bucks and the same results that we witnessed in Rockland began to 
develop in Blue Hill.  With continuous funding of $600,000/year, markets like the 
Blue Hill Farmers Market can provide seamless growing of the program, reaching 
more of our community members.  
It is incredibly rewarding to see local, organic food be available to all, while seeing 
the business base for local farms grow.  It doesn't get any better than knowing your 
neighbors are being taken care of while growing a strong, local food system.  We urge
you to give your full support to LD 568.
Thank you,
Molly DellaRoman and Timothy Skillin
