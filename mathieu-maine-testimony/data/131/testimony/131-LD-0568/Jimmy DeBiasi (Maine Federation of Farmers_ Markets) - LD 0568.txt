Testimony of Jimmy DeBiasi, Executive Director, Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets, 
before the 131"‘ Legislature ’s Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry 
Good afternoon Senator lngwersen, Representative Pleucker, and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry. My name is Jimmy DeBiasi and 
I am here today on behalf of the Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets (MFFM) to speak in 
support of LD 568 — An Act to Provide Funding for the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and 
Provide Nutrition Incentives. 
As Senator Pouliot mentioned, this funding appropriation also appears in the Governor ’s 
Budget, however the Governor ’s budget has this as a one-time allocation and we are 
advocating for this committee to support a continuous annual appropriation. 
Maine Harvest Bucks increases the purchasing power of shoppers who spend SNAP directly 
with ME farmers at over 80 farmers’ markets, farm stands, and CSA’s. Thanks to MHB, people 
using SNAP are accessing healthy local food options with their SNAP dollars, and those food 
sales benefit 300+ local food producers from Presque Isle and Houlton, to Blue Hill, Farmington, 
and Kittery. 
Just to note, MFFM administers the Maine Han/est Bucks program at 55 farmers’ markets and 
farm stands across Maine. Our partners, Cultivating Community, MOFGA, and St. Mary's 
Nutrition Center manage Maine Harvest Bucks at other direct to consumer locations. Good 
Shepherd Food Bank, runs our sister program, Farm Fresh Rewards, which takes place at small 
stores. In the last 2 years, our collective sales and impact amounts to over $2.3 million for the 
local food economy. Had we not been limited by a budget shortfall, we may have reached twice 
that amount in the last 2 years. 
The federal funding for our program is changing this year, resulting in a funding gap of nearly 
$200,000 for the farmers’ markets community alone. This winter, we've had to ask farmers to 
help fundraise for the program at their local markets. State funding for our program will help 
leverage the federal grant dollars and substantially shrinks our annual funding gap. Many states 
across the country, including VT, NH, and MA, are supporting nutrition incentive programs with 
state funding appropriations. lt’s the sustainable trajectory for these programs, and it is a great 
investment in public health and local economies in all parts of Maine. 
\Mth state funding, we will be able to fully fund Maine Harvest Bucks and increase the beneﬁt 
for shoppers in a time when SNAP allocations are dropping post-pandemic. Much of the funds 
will go towards buying fruits and vegetables from local farms, as it occurs when a shopper 
spends a Maine Han/est "Buck" . Funds will also help cover the administrative costs to run MHB 
at markets. For example, just $2500 worth of staffing at the Presque lsle Farmers’ Market info 
booth (where the program is managed from) allowed for more than $28,000 in SNAP and MHB 
sales for the vendors in 2022. That's an $11 to $1 return on investment. The ROI is even higher
