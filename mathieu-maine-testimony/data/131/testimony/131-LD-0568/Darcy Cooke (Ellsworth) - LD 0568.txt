LD 568
Greetings member of the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee,
My name is Darcy Cooke. I am a resident of Ellsworth, Maine, and I work as the 
State Coordinator for the Maine Network of Community Food Councils. I would like 
to submit this written testimony in strong support of LD568 and the funding it would 
provide to support programs such as Maine Harvest Bucks. The Maine Harvest Bucks
program makes a huge difference in the ability of lower income Mainers to access 
fresh healthy foods, while also supporting our local farms and in turn, our local 
economies as a whole. Many of our council members have actively worked to help 
promote Maine Harvest Bucks in their communities because they know how well this 
program, when fully funded, works. Thank you for your time and please support the 
passage of LD 568.
