LD 568
Greetings, and thank you for your time. I support LD 5688 - An Act to Provide 
Funding for the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and Provide Nutrition Incentives.
I have never known hunger or food insecurity. I can't imagine what it would be like to
have to choose between essential needs. But through volunteer time at Preble Street in
Portland and MCHPP here in Brunswick, I've learned that all kinds of people in all 
kinds of situations and times in their lives can experience food challenges for many 
different reasons. 
We as Mainers cannot let our neighbors go hungry at any time, but support is crucial 
at this time in particular, while so many are still recovering from the effects of the 
pandemic.
The type of support is also essential. I personally choose to buy foods from local 
farmers not only because I want my foods to be as fresh and nutritious as possible, but
because I want our local farms to grow and be successful so that they can continue to 
generate nutritious foods. 
But according to the Food Research and Action Center, "food insecure and 
low‚Äêincome people are especially vulnerable to poor nutrition and obesity."

Maine Harvest Bucks help our Maine neighbors get the nutrition they need by 
empowering them to buy wholesome local food - and help our local farms at the same
time.
With this in mind, please support continuous funding for Maine Harvest Bucks at the 
$600,000 per year level. Continuous funding will allow for growth and expansion of the 
program without any uncertainties or interruption, and ensure that Mainers have equal access
to not just food, but -healthy- food. Thank you.
