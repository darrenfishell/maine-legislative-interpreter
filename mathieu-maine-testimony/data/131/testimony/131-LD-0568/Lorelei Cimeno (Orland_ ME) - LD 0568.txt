LD 568
My name is Lorelei Cimeno, and I am a resident and farmer in Orland. I urge you to 
support LD 5688 - An Act to Provide Funding for the Fund to Address Food 
Insecurity and Provide Nutrition Incentives. I organize the Blue Hill Farmers’ market.
In 2022, our market started accepting SNAP and implemented the Maine Harvest 
Bucks (MHB) program. We were astounded at our success in the first year. The 
market accepted nearly $5,000 in SNAP and redeemed over $2,300 in MHB. This 
extra revenue was very beneficial to my farm. Our success also showed a significant 
need for MHB in our community, and great potential for growth of the program. I met
new customers in 2022 that did not have access to our farmers’ market before we 
implemented the MHB program. We can never let those customers lose access to our 
farmers’ market. Without state funding, the MHB program would not be sustainable 
at the Blue Hill Farmers’ market. In 2023, our market needs to fundraise for over 
$2,000 for the MHB program. That doesn’t cover labor costs. The info booth at our 
market, where SNAP payments and MHB is processed, is volunteer run. We are 
already running into issues around staffing the info booth. Fundraising for the MHB 
program is a substantial burden for me. The Blue Hill Farmers’ market, our 
community, and our state needs continuous funding for the MHB program at 
$600,000 per year. We need to ensure that all Mainers can access nutritious, local 
produce and support their local farmers.
