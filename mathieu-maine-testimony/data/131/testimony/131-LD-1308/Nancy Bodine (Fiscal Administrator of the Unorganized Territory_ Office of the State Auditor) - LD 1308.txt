Testimony - LD 1308 - An Act to Establish Municipal Cost Components for 
Unorganized Territory Services to Be Rendered in Fiscal Year 2023-2024 
Presented to the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Nancy V. Bodine, Fiscal Administrator of the Unorganized Territory 
Ofﬁce of the State Auditor 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation, my name is Nancy Bodine and I serve as the Fiscal Administrator for the 
Unorganized Territory. I am here today to testify in support of LD 1308 - An Act to Establish 
Municipal Cost Components for the Unorganized Territory Services to be rendered in Fiscal Year 
2023-2024. This legislation is presented annually in compliance with Title 36, Chapter 115: The 
Unorganized Territory Educational and Services Tax. 
Unorganized Territory (UT) taxpayers receive municipal type services from State agencies and 
from their counties within the Unorganized Territory Tax District, which was created by legislation 
in 1977. This legislation established a special purpose tax district in order to coordinate, contract 
and provide municipal type services to the UT because there is no local incorporated government 
to contract with or to provide municipal services. The majority of the UT is physically remote, 
rural, and represents approximately one half of the State of Maine land area. It is a challenge to 
provide these municipal services to the small population of less than 9,000 residents and businesses 
scattered across this large area of Maine. (reference UT map on page six) 
This bill funds the municipal services provided to the UT residents and taxpayers. LD 1308 
contains the proposed FY24 UT municipal service budgets from six State agencies and 12 counties 
that have been summarized and drafted for presentation to the legislature. All costs associated 
with the UT municipal services are funded by UT assessed and collected property taxes. 
The UT municipal services provided by State agencies and counties are known as the Municipal 
Cost Components (MCC). The budgets fall into the following categories: 
1) State Agency Services, 
2) County Services, 
3) County Tax Increment Financing (TIF) 
4) County Taxes 
Overall, the total estimated FY24 Municipal Cost Component legislative funding request, before 
county taxes and overlay, is $28,764,608, which is $1,186,399 or 4.3% higher than the budgeted 
amounts enacted for FY23. 
The process chart on the next page illustrates the ﬂow of taxpayer payments into the Unorganized 
Territory Education and Services Fund (UTES) and the distribution of these payments into the 
various municipal cost components. The process starts with legislative approval of the requested

funding in support of the UT. The Maine Revenue Service (MRS) State Tax Assessor (STA) 
applies this funding data to the MRS UT assessed property valuations to calculate mill rates and 
to prepare and issue the UT taxpayer bills. MRS then collects and deposits the UT property tax 
into the UTES fund. UT propeity tax revenues are transferred dollar for dollar into the State 
General Fund for all State agency expenditures related to services provided to the UT residents 
and taxpayers. Upon notiﬁcation from the STA, the Fiscal Administrator of the Unorganized 
Territory (FAUT) transfers funds to MRS for payment to the counties who provide municipal 
services to the UT residents and taxpayers.

1) State Agency Services Budgets 
The total FY24 State Agency budget of $12,758,102 increased by $313,506 or 2.5% from the 
FY23 State agency budget. The primary reason for this increase is the Education budget increase 
of $1,140,578 or 8.8% offset by the additional revenue transfer of $745,941 available from the 
UTES Fund Balance. The available UTES funds are the result of an accumulated tax overlay 
balance and the less than budget, actual State agency spending, which was held in reserve for the 
school renovations. 
2) County Services Budgets 
FY24 total County Services budgets increased by $1,063,033 or 8.9% from the FY23 budget. The 
leading service categories contributing to the increase are: 
Roads and Bridges - $161,769 or 7.3% 
Snow Removal - $561,606 or 12.5% 
Fire Protection & Public Safety (FP&PS) - $431,336 or 17.1% 
Capital Reserve - $155,000 or 5.0% 
Use of County Fund Balance - $148,467 or 50.5% 
The four counties with budget increases from FY23 to FY24 of greater than 8.9% or greater than 
$100,000, and the impacted major service categories are: 
Aroostook County — Snow Removal $41,644, FP&PS $74,352 
Penobscot County — Snow Removal $175,158, Use of Fund Balance $149,290 
Piscataquis County — Snow Removal $91,856 
Somerset County — Snow Removal $146,780, FP&PS $98,856, Capital Reserves 
$224,000, Other Revenue $153,390 
3) Coung TIF Budgets 
MRS has estimated the budget for County TIF at $3,027,917 which is $190,141 or 5.9% below the 
amount that was estimated for County TIF in FY23. The budget for the County TIF will be 
complete when mill rates are ﬁnalized in July. 
4) County Tax Budgets 
Although County Taxes for the UT are not included in the annual MCC legislation, they are 
included in the mill rate calculations for the UT Tax District, and they are paid from the UTES 
Fund. The FY24 County Taxes fund sheriff services, jail operations, district attomeys, probate 
courts, registry of deeds, and treasury operations within each county. Due to the large land area 
of the UT, which spreads across 12 Maine counties, the UT is one of the largest payers of county 
taxes in Maine. The County Tax budget is estimated to increase $329,039 or 4.7% from FY23 to 
FY24.

Trends. Comments. and Uncertainties 
The Total FY24 estimated tax commitment before county taxes and overlay shows an increase of 
$1,186,399 or 4.3% from FY23. Since 2019, this tax commitment has increased by a total of 
$2,858,414 which is an average annual growth of $571,683 or 2.2%. 
Economic Factors: 
0 Inﬂation between 2010-2020 averaged 1.7%, compared to a 4.7% average in 2021 
(1 74% increase), 8.0% average in 2022 (70% increase), and 6.4% for the beginning 
of 2023 (20% decrease). 
0 Fuel costs have increased an average of 36% from the average 2020 rate of 
$2.23/gal to an average of $3.02/gal for 2021. The 2022 average rate of $4.08/gal 
is another 35% increase. 
0 Workforce shortages and wage expectations are having an impact on the renewal 
of various service contracts. 
0 Supply chain disruptions continue to cause increases in material cost and delivery 
backlog. 
State Agency: 
r The UT education budget includes a capital plan for the purchase of one bus on an 
annual basis. The three EUT schools are older structures and require signiﬁcant 
repair and renovations. Site evaluations are nearing completion with phase one 
costs included in the budgeting and funding requests. 
0 MRS has completed the implementation of the new, upgraded assessment system 
used in determining UT property taxes. This budget includes funding to purchase 
ten electronic assessor tablets. 
County Service: 
0 Roads & Bridges — FY24 increase 7.3%, ﬁve-year average 7.8% 
0 Snow Removal — F Y24 increase 12.5%, ﬁve-year average 7.4% 
Solid Waste — FY24 increase 7.7%, ﬁve-year average 4.5% 
Fire Protection & Public Safety — FY24 increase 17.1%, ﬁve-year average 21.3% 
Excise Tax Revenue — FY24 increase 4.1%, ﬁve-year average increase 5.2% 
Capital Reserve — F Y24 increase 5.0%, ﬁve-year average increase 9.2% 
County Taxes: 
0 During the 2015 Legislative Session, the Board of Corrections that oversaw county 
jails was disbanded and counties resumed full control of their county jails. 
0 Due to the uncertainty of state funding support for jail operations, the cost of county 
jails may rest exclusively on property tax funding. The need for facility repair and 
renovation has been raised as a funding concem. 
0 The Public Safety services provided to the UT by the County Sheriff departments 
are beginning to experience constraints due to stafﬁng shortages and a shift in State 
Police resource support.

Deorganizationz 
0 Drew Plantation, in Penobscot County, started the deorganization process 
approximately 18 months ago. Final legislative approval occurred in April 2023 
with the effective deorganization date of July 1, 2023. Drew Plantation ’s ﬁnal 
citizen vote will occur early in May. The funding for Drew Township is included 
in this MCC funding request. 
This concludes my testimony on LD 1308. Thank you for the opportunity and I am happy to 
answer any questions the committee may have.
