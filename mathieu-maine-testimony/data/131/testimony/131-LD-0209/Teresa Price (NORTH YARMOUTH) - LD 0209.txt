NORTH YARMOUTH
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Teresa Price and I am a resident of North  Yarmouth. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.” I should mention that the proposed 
trail crosses my cul-de-sac road so it affects me directly.
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.  I was a serious runner for years and very reluctantly 
ran on North Road, which parallels the proposed trail.  I bought bright yellow clothes 
and wore a light if it was near dusk.  Every time I ran, I knew I ran the risk of being 
hit by a car.  Now I love to bike, and it is just too dangerous for me to bike down 
North Road even to Ledge Road, where it's safer.  The new trail would open up a 
world of exercise to me and many, many people in our area.  I understand that not all 
citizens would use it, but enough would to make it well-worth the investment.  I've 
used the trail on Cape Cod, and wow, it was fantastic.  Some people have advanced 
the idea that the trail would bring criminals to the area, which seems ludicrous when 
they can drive right up to any house.  Common sense would indicate that the trail 
would be a great asset to our communities and we can leave a real legacy to our 
children and grandchildren.  Thanks for your consideration of this laudable goal.
