Greetings, 
My name is George Janda.  I live in Portland and support the expansion of the Casco 
Bay Trail.  This would benefit the community as a whole and help more people have 
access to outdoor recreational activities improving quality of life and promoting a 
healthy active lifestyle.  
Thank you,
George Janda
