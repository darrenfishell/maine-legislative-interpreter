LD 209
I support passage of LD209 to authorize trail acces on the Berlin Subdivision Rail 
Corridor. Cycling on Maine roads is dangerous with lack of shoulders and fast 
drivers. Connecting communities on Rail Trails is a great use of the existing 
resources. My family would utilize these trails often!
Thank you!
