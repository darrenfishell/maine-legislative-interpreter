Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Susan Hayhurst, and I am a resident of Falmouth. I am writing to testify 
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
My family and I enjoy being active and bike riding, but it’s difficult with the busy 
roads around here. My girls, who are 13 years old, are nervous bike riding on Route 
one or route 88. Or many other roads in the area. As a result, we don’t ride our bikes 
nearly as much as I would wish. I worked for eight years in the Kennebunk area and I 
adored the rail trail there, and I kept wishing we could have something like that in our
community. Similarly, a rail trail went in near my parents home in Indiana, and they 
enjoy it and we all bike ride and walk on it when we go home to visit.  It seems like 
such a wonderful use of these old transportation corridor‘s, that benefits so many 
different people. You can see older folks walking and bike riding, young kids learning
to ride their bikes, and so on. I know that my husband would enjoy commuting on the 
rail trail, my family would enjoy having outings on it, and we would use it multiple 
days per week.
This would be such a benefit to our local community and so many communities that it
connects. I’m sure property owners right nearby would benefit, but other people could
visit as well. I hope this project can happen both for my family and for the 
community.
Sincerely,
Susan Hayhurst MS DVM
