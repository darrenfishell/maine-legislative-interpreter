As a resident of Portland, a Board Member of Portland Trails, a former Outward 
Bound Instructor, a cyclist, hiker, and a dad, I fully support the bills before the 
Transportation Committee today that the RUAC has put forth. 
Multi-use trails have numerous and significant community health and economic 
development benefits. Creating active transportation corridors is a terrific long-term 
investment for the state which will enhance the lives of our citizens and increase 
outdoor recreation tourism opportunities. 
In the past couple of years, I personally have experienced two rail trails in other states
– New York and Pennsylvania. The Empire State Trail stretches hundreds of miles 
along the Erie Canal and Hudson River, all the way to NYC. The Great Allegany 
Passage runs 150 miles from Pittsberg, Pennsylvania to Cumberland, Maryland. 
As I rode these car-free corridors, I wondered how they came to be – who had the 
vision and will to prioritize and fund these massive projects? The answer is exactly 
what you are doing today - elected officials with the conviction to enhance the future 
of their states through concerted action. I applaud the thoughtful proposals of RUAC, 
and I encourage you today, to bring this work one step closer to reality. 
Thank you.
