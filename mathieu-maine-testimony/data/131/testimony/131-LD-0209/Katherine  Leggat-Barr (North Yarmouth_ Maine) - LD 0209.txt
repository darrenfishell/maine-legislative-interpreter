LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Katherine Leggat-Barr. While I currently live in San Francisco, 
California, I grew up in North Yarmouth, Maine and am returning shortly to Maine 
for medical school to attend Tufts Maine Track. I am writing to testify in strong 
support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
I ran cross country and track in high school at Greely and in college, and have 
enjoyed running and training on trails similar to the proposed rail trail in college and 
post collegiately. A trail without cars to recreate on would enable me and others to 
run safely and with friends. The collegiately and community found through running is
something I value deeply and this trail would help facilitate this for me and others.
Thank you.
Katherine Leggat-Barr
