Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Jason Perkins and I have lived in North Yarmouth for 18 years. I am 
writing to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, 
“Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
This rail trail in our community would be an incredible resource, connecting towns in 
a green and enjoyable way.  Our family would regularly use this trail for recreation. 
exercise and for visiting our friends and families in neighboring communities.
Thank you.
Jason
