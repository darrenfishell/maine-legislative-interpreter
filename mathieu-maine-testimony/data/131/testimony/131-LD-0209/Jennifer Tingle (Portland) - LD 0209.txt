Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Jennifer Tingle and I am a resident of Portland. My house is a block away
from the rail corridor. I am writing to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed
amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to 
Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory 
Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
My husband Ed Cunningham and I would use the trail to ride to Falmouth to do 
weekly errands - visit the Falmouth Memorial Library, mail packages at Shaw’s, shop
at Goodwill etc. We would also take longer rides for fun to visit Cumberland and 
Yarmouth. It would be a great way to get to the Yarmouth Clam Festival!
As car traffic increases in the area it is important to find safer places to use bicycles 
for commuting, errands and recreation. 
Thank you.
Jennifer Tingle
