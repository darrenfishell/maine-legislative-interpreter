Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Laurie Hanley and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
After my husband suffered a bad biking accident from a distracted driver, I became 
more fearful of riding our tandem bike on car-driven roads. We now actively seek out 
off-road biking opportunities throughout New England, but would love to be able to 
bike more in our own backyard. 
We are retired and would regularly use the trail in the warmer months. In addition, it 
would provide a safe place for our entire family (3 generations) to bike together. 
An active lifestyle is critical to good mental and physical health which ultimately 
saves lives and money (healthcare costs). This project is an opportunity to show that 
Maine supports providing safe, bike paths which connect communities for recreation 
as well as commuting to work.
Thank you.
Laurie (Hanley)
