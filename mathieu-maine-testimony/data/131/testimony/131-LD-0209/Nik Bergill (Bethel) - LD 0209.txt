LD 209
Hello,
My name is Nik Bergill and I am a Maine resident writing in support of LD 209, An 
Act to Authorize an Interim Use Trail on the Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor. I have 
lived in both urban and rural settings in Maine, and I have come to realize the vital 
importance of prioritizing small and/or human-powered transport over cars in 
scenario. 
The creation of a rail trail connecting Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, 
North Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester, and Auburn would not only provide 
recreation opportunity, it would reduce commuter traffic and incentivize young 
Mainers to consider investing in communities beyond Portland. Rail trails make lives 
better, and I hope that you will authorize this unused rail corridor for more 
human-powered transit.
