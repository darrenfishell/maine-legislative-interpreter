LD 209
I am a resident of Portland and am writing in strong support of LD209. Rail trails are 
incredible amenities for their communities and attract visitors from away. The state 
should support efforts to increase outdoor recreation that is healthy and nonpolluting, 
easily accessible without driving. This rail trail is the perfect solution. Please pass 
LD209!
