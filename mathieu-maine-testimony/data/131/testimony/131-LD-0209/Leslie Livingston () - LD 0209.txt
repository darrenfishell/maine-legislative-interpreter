LD 209 Testimony
Full Name: Leslie Livingston
Address: 1176 North Rd.
City/Town: North Yarmouth
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Leslie Livingston and I am a resident of North Yarmouth. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
My property borders the rail line and I have lived here since 1997.  No trains have run
for many years.  My family likes to bike and walk and North Road is a busy 
thoroughfare for folks to get to Rt. 1 and 295.  Honestly it is unsafe to ride a bike or 
walk on it and the surrounding roads.  Having the rail trail would be excellent and 
allow for a safe way for us and others to get out without the worry of being hit by 
speeding cars.
I strongly urge you to support this use for the rail line.
Thank you.
Leslie Livingston
