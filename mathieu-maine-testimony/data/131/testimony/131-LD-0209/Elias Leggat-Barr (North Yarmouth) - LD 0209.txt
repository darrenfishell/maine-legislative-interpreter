Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Elias Leggat-Barr and I am a resident of North Yarmouth. I am writing to
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community. I believe access to the out-of-doors and exploration 
should be a central oppurunitiy for adults and kids alike in our State, and believe this 
trail opens up an unprecedented opportunity for outdoor leisure and exploration 
amongst the Maine population, which would be an amazing resource for all in the 
years to come and present a myriad of benefits. Living close to a trail network, Pratts 
Brook, right down my road, I have lived the privilege of growing up near such 
intricate and well-maintained nature trails right near my house. Through providing a 
trail running spot, or a grounding and restorative opportunity for a nature walk, alone 
or with friends, trail systems give back so much to the community and can be a hub 
for recreation and quality time spent outdoors. A trail such as this which links such a 
long stretch of Maine together is particularly unique, given it could open up 
opportunities for varying outdoor accomplishments, like the biking of the entirety of 
the trail, and various trail runs and 5k's which could be held on this expansive stretch 
of the famous "rail trail." I think the opportunity of this natural community resource 
being a reality is one which we cannot pass up, and believe you should all act 
accordingly to make this resource which will serve the Maine community for decades 
to come, a reality. 
Thank you.
Elias Leggat-Barr
