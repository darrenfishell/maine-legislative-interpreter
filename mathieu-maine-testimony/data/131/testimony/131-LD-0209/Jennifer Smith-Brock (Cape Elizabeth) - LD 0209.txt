I am writing to urge you to support  the Casco Bay Trail along the unused rail line 
from Portland to Auburn. This trail would open up commuting opportunities for lots 
of people. I have been trying to find a safe place to do part of my commute by bike, 
but the roads to the Cumberland schools from the south do not feel safe to me on a 
bike. This trail would provide that option.
As a teacher, I am also eager for vastly increased opportunities for children to bike 
and walk for exercise, fresh air, and mental health. Off-road trails are many times 
safer than roads with cars going above 20 mph.  Seniors also benefit greatly from 
access to safe mixed-use trails.
Biking and walking provide huge benefits to individuals and to society, in terms of 
health impacts, financial savings, and reducing greenhouse gases when trips decrease 
car use.
Thank you for your consideration.
