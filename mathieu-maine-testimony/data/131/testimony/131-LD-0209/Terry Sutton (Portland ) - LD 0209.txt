LD 209
Dear Legislators,
I am a resident of Portland and an avid bicycle rider.  I am writing to support LD209 
as the implementation of this off road trail would transform our daily cycling 
experience....making it much safer for all involved.  In the biking season I regularly 
take my life in my hands navigating the roads north of Portland towards Yarmouth 
and Freeport.  The roads are very dangerous for cyclists despite the awareness raising 
about keeping cyclists safe.  The roads we all ride on are busy and drivers are very 
impatient.  I can't count the number of close calls I and my cycling friends have 
experienced.  I believe this trail will increase cycling for all levels of skill and be a 
tremendous asset for the local community.  Please don't allow this fabulous 
opportunity to slip by.
