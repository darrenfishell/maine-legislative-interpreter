Subject: Support for LD209 - Portland to Auburn Rail-to-Trail Project 
 
As a resident of Cape Elizabeth, an avid cyclist, and outdoor enthusiast, I am writing to express 
my wholehearted support for Representative Bellâ€™s proposed amendment to LD209, "Resolve, 
to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council." This bill proposes the conversion of an old rail bed into a 
multi-use trail that will benefit cyclists, runners, walkers, families, and more by providing a safe 
and accessible route between Portland and Auburn, Maine. 
 
The current infrastructure in our region lacks safe and adequate options for bicycle commuters 
and recreational cyclists. Many roads are narrow, have limited shoulders, or have high-speed 
traffic, which poses a significant safety risk for cyclists. This new trail would provide a much-
needed alternative route for those looking to commute between towns or simply enjoy outdoor 
activities without the fear of sharing the road with motor vehicles. 
 
In addition to the safety and accessibility benefits, the proposed trail would positively impact 
the environment and public health. By encouraging more people to use bicycles or e-bikes for 
commuting and recreation, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle congestion, 
ultimately promoting a cleaner and greener community. Furthermore, the trail would offer 
ample opportunities for exercise, which can improve the overall health and well-being of our 
citizens. 
 
The development of the Portland to Auburn Rail-to-Trail project is an investment in the future 
of our region. It would enhance our quality of life, foster a sense of community, and promote 
sustainable transportation alternatives. I kindly urge you and the other members of the 
Transportation Committee to support LD209 and bring this valuable trail to fruition for the 
benefit of all residents in the Portland and Auburn areas. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Carrie McCusker
