Scott Douglas
North Yarmouth
LD 209
My name is Scott Douglas. I live in North Yarmouth and strongly support Rep. Bell’s 
proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of 
Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use
Advisory Council.”
There are many good reasons to build this trail. Two major ones--public health and 
public safety--are related.
The trail will be a boon to public health because it will encourage more people to 
walk, ride, and run. There’s overwhelming evidence for regular exercise of this sort 
reducing rates of morbidity and delaying mortality.
The trail will also be a boon to public safety. One big reason many people don’t walk,
ride, or run on public roads is the threat from motorized vehicles. We all know that 
more people drive distracted today. Speeding has been documented to have increased 
since the onset of the Covid pandemic. Combine those trends with the ever-increasing
size of cars and trucks, and you get a lot of risk simply for being a pedestrian or 
cyclist on a public road. This isn’t how things should be, but it’s the current reality. 
The trail will provide a safe, welcoming environment for currently active and 
potentially active residents of the many municipalities near the trail to exercise, 
socialize, and enjoy being outside.
Thank you for considering my opinion.
