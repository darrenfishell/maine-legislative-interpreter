LD 209
I would like you to know of my complete support of LD209.  As an avid cyclist and 
outdoor walker, and one quickly approaching retirement, I now utilize the Eastern 
Trail here at home but also travel around the country to utilize other rail trails.  I 
would love to have this corridor converted to cycling and walking use and I would use
it regularly since it is very close to where I live in North Yarmouth.  I hope you will 
pass this Act and allow the people working hard to make it happen to go to work and 
get it done.  Thank you for your consideration and your work on our behalf in 
Augusta.
