Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Jeffrey Eckhouse, a resident of  North Yarmouth, ME. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
I would would regularly utilize this trail for my daily commute from North Yarmouth 
into Portland. It would also be a great local draw for our family to use recreationally 
with our young son.  Lastly, I believe that this sort of development is exactly the type 
of infrastructure that improves home values and economic activity from tourists 
traveling to find high quality rail trail options.
Thank you.
Jeffrey Eckhouse
