A rail trail connecting Portland to Auburn would be a massive benefit to both 
communities and every community along the way.
Having a dedicated bike lane opens up regional tourism potential for cycling tourism 
which can attract both tourist dollars as well as incentivize local spending.
I would use the trail frequently and considering riding and overnighting in Auburn, 
which I otherwise would never do. 
I think it has the potential to connect these cities in a really meaningful way.
