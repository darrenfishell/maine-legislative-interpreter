I want to express my support for the proposed rail trail.  This opportunity allows an 
unused resource be transitioned to a useful wonderful resource for the residents and 
visitors to Maine to enjoy.  An opportunity such as this needs to be taken advantage to
provide recreational and commuting options for all.  The legal barriers to this need to 
be overcome so this type of resource can be expanded and become a key part of 
Maine's recreational landscape.
