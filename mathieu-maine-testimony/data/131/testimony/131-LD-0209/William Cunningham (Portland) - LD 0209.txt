Hello Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation
Committee,
I am Will Cunningham, a Portland resident and college student. I am writing today in 
support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having a proper bicycle path connecting Portland to Yarmouth and beyond would be 
a great boon to me and others in my community.
As it stands now, the best ways to go north from Portland by bicycle are a choice of 
either state route 88 or route 1. Both of these roads are extremely stressful to ride on 
during peak traffic hours, and route 1 in particular often has debris on the shoulder of 
the road to the point that it is simply unsafe to ride on. With the proposed bike path 
available, reaching towns like Pownal, Yarmouth, and even Freeport would be much 
easier as bad traffic in the greater Portland area would be easy to bypass.
With the current state of the climate crisis, it is becoming increasingly obvious that 
anything we can do to reduce carbon emissions is necessary. Granting Portland 
residents the freedom to choose to take their bicycles instead of their cars when 
traveling north will help encourage more people to get off the road and onto safer, 
healthier, and more environmentally sustainable forms of transport. 
Thank you,
Will
