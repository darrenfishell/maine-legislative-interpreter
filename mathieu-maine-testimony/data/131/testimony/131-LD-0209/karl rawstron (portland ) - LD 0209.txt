LD 209
I oppose LD 209.     I oppose removing rails to construct trails.  I oppose the removal 
of railroad infrastructure owned by Maine tax payers for a single special interest use.  
I oppose the destruction of these Maine owned assets that are vital infrastructure 
assets to address climate change, provide transportation alternatives, and build a 
alternative more green future.   
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association since 1981 global 
temperatures have risen at twice their historic rate per decade.
The Gulf of Me Research Institute reports the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 
99% of the global ocean.
Climate.gov reports the 10 warmest years in the historical record have all occurred 
since 2010
The polar ice cap has melted in half since 1980.
Scientist globally say weâ€™re are in the midst of a 6th Mass Extinction
We should be building public mass transportation alternatives not special interest 
single use recreational options. Our existing rail infrastructure is critical to addressing 
climate change and building an alternative freight and passenger transportation future.
 The people using these trails will be driving to these location with their bikes on bike 
racks on their cars.  Having a day bike outing, putting their bike back on their car and 
biking home.  
And I oppose taking money from general funds, taking from more critical needs like 
housing, education, and healthcare, to build these projects.  
Thank you very much,
