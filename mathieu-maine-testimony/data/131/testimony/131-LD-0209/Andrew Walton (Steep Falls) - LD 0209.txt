Steep Falls
LD 209
Good afternoon,
My name is Andrew Walton from Steep Falls(Standish). I support LD 209. The best 
use of the not active railroad from Portland to Lewiston is an trail until rail as this was
the result from the Rail Use Advisory Council. 
I urge you to vote Ought to Pass LD 209.
Thank you for your time.
Andrew Walton
