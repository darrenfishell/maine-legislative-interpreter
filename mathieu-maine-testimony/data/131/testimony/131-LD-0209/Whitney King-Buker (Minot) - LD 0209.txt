We, The People of Maine, have miles of environmental transportation infrastructure 
currently available to utilize throughout our State right now, including this span of rail
line.
Rail lines, as well as passenger rail, are highly environmental, economical and 
emotionally viable for the People of our State, as well as future generations, to benefit
and preserve our State's habitats, air quality, financial gains and tangible connection 
to our State. 
By removing these rail lines we are not just ripping up highly feasible environmental 
modes of transportation, but we are cementing our State and its children to 
generations of thousands of miles of asphalt-further paving over the natural habitats 
that our wildlife and people call home: Financial and environmental destruction.  
I oppose the removal of these rail lines and the ability to not be allowed to utilize 
them for such purposes.
