Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Evan LaMarre and I am a resident of Freeport. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
I would use the trail for both commuting and recreating. I recently returned home to 
Maine after a number of years in San Francisco. I've been surprised by the lack of 
bike infrastructure in the greater Portland area. I often feel much less safe riding here 
than I did in San Francisco. I am incredibly excited about creating more off-road 
options.
Currently I'm excited about the possibilities for recreating on the trail. I envision 
organizing group rides during the week that incorporate the trail. I'm also very excited
about leveraging the trail for weekend rides to explore other communities. Biking the 
trail to get lunch in another community sounds like a great Saturday.
I currently have a remote job but look forwards to a future where I have a local job 
and could leverage the trail to commute. Living in a community along the trail and 
using an e-bike to commute to portland sounds pretty ideal.
Thank you.
Evan LaMarre
