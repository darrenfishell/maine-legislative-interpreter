LD 209
Hello once more. I am Jack Duffin of Windham, New Hampshire, writing in 
opposition of LD 209, along with LD 404 and LD 1450.
I figure you’ll find similar testimonies giving a myriad of reasons to avoid ripping up 
the Berlin Subdivision, Mountain Division, and other lines (freight and passenger rail 
boosting economic development, lowered emissions, potential for increased tourism, 
taking cars and trucks off the road which saves maintenance cost), so I’ll spare you 
the nitty gritty about the widely reported potential benefits. Nor will I get into the 
concept of rails-with-trails, although I do believe they would be the best option for 
these lines and please the greatest amount of people.
Instead, I want to further discuss something I mentioned in my last testimony. As seen
in my introduction, I do not live in Maine; I’m from New Hampshire. The Mountain 
Division and Berlin Subdivisin are interstate (and international, up to Canada) rail 
corridors. Cutting off vital portions of these corridors and transforming them into 
trails is a major disservice to New Hampshire, Vermont, and the Quebec province. 
I understand it is not the duty of a Maine legislator to change their mind based on the 
opinions of a small town New Hampshire resident, or someone from Vermont, and 
least of all Canada. That being said, allowing any of these bills to pass would be 
detrimental not just to Maine citizens and businesses, but to all those who pass within 
and through Maine and the greater northeast region. I am confident I am not the only 
one who holds these reservations.
I implore you to throw out the mindset that the cheapest option is the best option, and 
reconsider tearing up these rails for trails.
