I am a long time resident of Yarmouth and a member of the town's Parks and Lands 
Committee. I have raised my 3 children here and would love to see the trail be 
approved for a multitude of reasons. They are (in no particular order):
recreational benefits for ALL ages, allowing transportation off the roads to 
neighboring communities, increasing safe venues for fitness activities, environmental 
benefits, and an economic boon to local shops and businesses. I urge the committee to
accept the trail proposal until such time as rail becomes feasible.
