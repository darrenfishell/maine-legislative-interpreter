Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Randall Arendt and I reside in Brunswick. I am writing to express my 
very strong support for Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
I and my family feel that this rail trail would be a huge asset and one that would 
benefit countless Mainers here and in other communities. We enjoy bicycling, and 
expect we would use this trail at least several times a month from April through 
October.
Thank you for considering our views.
Randall Arendt
