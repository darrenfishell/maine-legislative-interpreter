Yarmouth, ME 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Dana Riker and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
My spouse and I are avid runners and cyclists and are in strong support of creation of 
the trail so that we can run and bike safely on the beauty of a dedicated trail, away 
from motor vehicles. We also have two young children who live to ride their bicycles,
and I feel our whole family would frequent this trail almost daily if it is approved and 
constructed. 
My husband and I also both work in Portland and would consider commuting by 
bicycle during warmer weather months should the trail be approved and constructed. 
My sister-in-law coaches the Yarmouth High School Nordic Ski team, who would 
benefit from a trail such as this directly in our community for running and roller 
skiing when snow is not available for their training. 
The approval and creation of this trail would be an incredible asset to our community.
Please strongly consider supporting bill LD 209. 
Thank you.
Dana Riker
