The conversion of the rail to trail from Portland to Auburn would be a significant 
benefit to our community. It encourages people to get outdoors in a time when people 
tend to stay inside more than they should. The trail would connect towns, 
communities, and neighborhoods. It would also be a tourist attraction that fits well 
with the state of Maine brand. Please support.
