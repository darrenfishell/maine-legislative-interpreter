Stephanie  Mangum
Yarmouth
LD 209
My name is Stephanie Mangum and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
I believe that developing trail use on this unused railway would promote community 
and an appreciation of physical activity and nature. I would love to be able to bike the
trail with my two young boys.
