Senator Chipman,  Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Peggy Brown and I am a resident of Brunswick.  I am writing in support 
of Rep. Bell's proposed amendment to LD 209, "Resolve, to Direct the Department of 
Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use
Advisory Council".  Having rail trails like this linking communities in Maine would 
encourage active transportation for Mainers of all agers.  It would impact those who 
live near the trail by giving them opportunities to walk and ride safely away from 
motor vehicles and it would draw folks from away looking for a beautiful and safe 
place to be active outdoors. There are economic, environmental and health benefits 
for all of us in Maine every time we make such an improvement in our state. Please 
give this project your support.
Thank you.
