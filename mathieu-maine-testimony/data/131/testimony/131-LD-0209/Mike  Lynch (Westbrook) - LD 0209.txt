LD 209
I am a 70+ year old avid cyclist living in Westbrook.  I often ride from my home up to
Pineland area returning through North Yarmouth and Yarmouth.   Because of safety 
reasons, (ie lack of shoulders, cars driving at excess speeds, etc.) I stay off state roads 
as much as possible.  Having a paved rail trail would be much safer, more enjoyable, 
better scenery, and more direct than the “out of the way” back roads I currently use.  
I have biked on rail trails in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.  My two sons
learned to ride on rail trails.  They have positive benefits for the communities they run
through, and health benefits for those who walk, jog, or bike on them.    Please 
approve LD 209, and get on the calendar to be completed as soon as possible.
