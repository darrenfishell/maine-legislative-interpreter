Cam Regan
Portland
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Cam Regan and I am a resident of Portland, ME. I am writing to testify in
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
Two months ago, my fiance was hit by a car with a distracted driver while we were 
biking home to our apartment in Portland. I was directly behind her, and saw her 
smash into the windshield and land on the pavement. 
This has been the hardest 2 months of our lives as she has recovered from surgery, but
we are so fortunate to say that she will eventually make a full recovery. However, no 
doubt — getting back on the bike will be a tremendous challenge, due to mental 
health trauma. 
This bike path would be a safe haven for her, and so many others who are hesitant to 
enjoy riding bikes, for fear of exactly what happened to her. In my mind, this is a 
public health issue with tremendous upside potential. 
We would utilize this path almost everyday. 
Thank you.
Cam
