Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Kimberly Powers and I am a resident of North Yarmouth. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
Our family would enjoy a safe place off our busy roads to walk, run, bike and spend 
time together.  Our community has a very special connection to our landscape, a rail 
trail would increase the opportunities to spend and enjoy time  outside. 
Thank you.
Kimberly Powers
