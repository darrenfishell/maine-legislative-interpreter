I fully endorse an interim use trail on the Berlin Subdivision rail corridor.  The rail 
trail is a critical move forward for not just transportation. But for betterment of health 
and wellness of all 
I for one am very excited to be a Yarmouth resident, where hopefully we will have a 
connection from Main Street to Route One.
