Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Kelley and I am a resident of Bath. I am writing to testify in strong 
support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having a rail trail through these communities would be an incredible resource for 
Maine.
As a cyclist I have seen first hand how dangerous our roads have become for 
non-vehicle users. Mainers and visitors alike deserve safer spaces to recreate. 
Multi-use rail trails provide this opportunity. Additionally, due to the gentle grade and
wide nature rail trails this would allow access to the outdoors for many people who 
otherwise could not access other public trails due to roots, rocks, and other terrain 
features. 
A few weekends ago I visited a section of the Eastern Trail in Scarborough and was 
delighted to see it full of different trails users and passed multiple packed parking lots.
I for one am very excited about the prospect of this new rail trail and I know the 
people of Maine would utilize it.
Thank you for your time and consideration of this trail,
Kelley
