My name is Catherine Chamberlain and I live in Falmouth, Maine; formerly of Brewster (Cape 
Cod), Massachusetts. I am here to show my support for the Casco Bay Trail vision. 
For fifteen years I lived on Cape Cod, home of the Cape Cod Rail Trail (CCRT). The trail is very 
popular for families and tourists visiting the area as well as residents and commuters. Many 
enjoy the safety, convenience and beauty of the CCRT year round. 
On the CCRT there are several places to stop for a meal, refreshments or a little shopping along 
the way. We would begin a ride by saying "letâ€˜s go to the Sparrow" for coffee or maybe La 
Boulangerie down the trail another fifteen miles. The CCRT is a true gem. 
I am excited about the plan to create something similar in the Casco Bay area. The trail will 
facilitate connection of individual towns through the development of this off road trail. Trail 
users will find that a sense of community is formed when they stop to visit someone they 
recognize or view a wild animal, plant or flower. Trail users tend towards a relaxed friendliness. 
Maybe a local coffee shop or ice cream bar will become the "go to" place. 
The consistant grade of a rail trail aids in accessability for people of varying mobility. Removing 
the distraction and danger of riding on the roads lets people relax and enjoy their surroundings. 
Families can go on outings and children can practice their walking or riding skills. People who 
commute by bike will be able to do so safely. And the benefits of exercise can never be over 
emphasized. 
The Casco Bay Trail is a win win vision. I can't wait to say "meet you at the trai|".
