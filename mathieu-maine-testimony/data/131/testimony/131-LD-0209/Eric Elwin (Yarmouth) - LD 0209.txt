Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Eric R. Elwin and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in 
support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
The more trails available dedicated to non vehicular traffic throughout the state and 
particularly in our community benefit everyone by providing safe and beautiful places
to hike in our community and serve as a positive connection between communities.
I could foresee my family using the trail at least several times a year, throughout the 
year.
Thank you.
Eric R. elwin
