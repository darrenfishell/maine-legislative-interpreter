LD 209
I am writing to strongly support representative Bell's proposed amendment to LD 209 
"Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.  
After 25 years of service in the United States Coast Guard, I chose to settle my family
in Yarmouth in 2016 and create a small international business here in Maine.  Largely
attracted to generational ties to Piscatiquis County and outdoor activities that lead to 
an active lifestyle.  I am a biker, and all three of my sons ride their bikes to the 
Yarmouth Schools throughout the year.
When I think back on my many duty stations in the Coast Guard, I recall those most 
fondly where I had the opportunity to commute to work on my bicycle.  Biking from 
West Seattle into Pier 36, or riding from Jamaica Plain to the North End of Boston.  I 
have come to recognize that most of the 100s of Coast Guard members that are 
stationed in South Portland live south of the city.  I believe some may consider living 
in communities of Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth and beyond if this trail enabled 
them to commute to work on a bicycle.
Further, my family has spent one week on Cape Cod each summer and an annual 
tradition is utilize the rail trail on our bicycles to explore the outer Cape without the 
hassle of vehicle traffic while getting exercise.  I am always impressed by the 
numbers of locals and vacationers the utilize the trail, supporting a whole economy of 
restaurants, bike shops, museums, etc, that are along the trail.  I could certainly see 
such benefits for the many communities along this trail.
I strongly encourage Maine to make this investment - it is an investment in the 
economy, the environment, and Maine's citizen's health.
Sincerely,
