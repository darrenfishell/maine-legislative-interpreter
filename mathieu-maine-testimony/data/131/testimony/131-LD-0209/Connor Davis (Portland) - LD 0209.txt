Hello,
My name is Connor Davis. I'm a father, a business owner, and a proud resident of 
Portland. I grew up in Vermont where the abundance of long-distance trails was a true
privelege—connecting communities across the state. I then experienced much of the 
same in Colorado, where growing trail networks is a major staple of the state's fabric.
In Maine, however, I haven't found that same attention toward proper, long-distance 
trails. Our trails are often fragmented and isolated in their own little pockets of this 
region, making the bigger and longer adventures feel out of reach.
What's being proposed for this new trail system is absolutely crucial for Maine's 
outdoor economy. Not only will it bring overwhemling joy to Mainers and visitors 
alike—it will improve this region's economic fabric vastly, connecting communities 
and providing opportunities to spend our dollars along the trail.
Most of all, this new system just makes sense. While preserving the history of Maine 
should always be a priority, this is a way to reimagine forgotten corners of this region 
and bring them back to life in a modern way that people can truly enjoy.
I hope to ride this trail with my friends, my kids, my clients, and beyond. Approving 
it is the right thing to do, and I'm confident you will come to the same conclusion.
