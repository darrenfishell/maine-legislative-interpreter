Hi, 
My name is Evan Zimmerman, I'm a North Yarmouth resident and have raised my 2 
daughters here in the Greely school system. 
We would greatly appreciate use of the nearby rail route for a rail trail system. We 
pass the North Yarmouth portion of the proposed trail every day, it is a very short 
distance away from our home. 
Having access to this so close by would be a huge improvement in safety and general 
pleasantness for our family over having to utilize high speed local Routes for biking 
and walking. 
We are fully in support. Thanks for your consideration.
