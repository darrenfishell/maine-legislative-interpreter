The building of a rail trail that links Portland to Auburn will benefit not only the 
people who live along its corridor, in terms of exercise and safe alternative 
commuting possibilities, but will be a significant draw for cycle tourists and day users
from out of state. It will generate economic activity in many ways, and make Maine 
and even better place to live! I support the trail!
