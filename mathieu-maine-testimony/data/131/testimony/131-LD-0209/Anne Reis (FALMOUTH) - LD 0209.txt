LD 209
RE: Support LD209 
My name is Anne Reis and I am a cyclist who resides in Falmouth, Maine.  I ride for 
pleasure, exercise and when I can for transportation.  My cycling literally takes me 
thousands of miles each year.
I am unable to attend the transportation hearings in Augusta on Thursday May 18th 
but I wanted to state that I strongly support LD 209, a bill that would authorize a rail 
trail on the unused corridor connecting Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, 
North Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester, and Auburn.  This would be a tremendous
off-road route for biking (and other activities) for transportation, recreation, and 
physical activity.  
LD 209 makes sense for many reasons.  It would be a good use for the rail line land.  
It would be an invaluable and safe place for families with children to exercise 
outdoors and enjoy nature.  With our national and state statistics on obesity more 
opportunities for healthy and safe outdoor activities are needed.  
It would also be a great off-road bike transportation avenue.  I see people commuting 
to work by bike.  However, some people are reluctant to commute by bike because 
they are afraid to ride on roads with cars.  Having an off-road option would be a 
fantastic way to encourage more people to commute by bike.  
I appreciate all the work that has been done on behalf of this bill and this project.  I 
sincerely hope that enough Maine citizens will support this unique and important 
opportunity.
Sincerely,
Anne Reis
