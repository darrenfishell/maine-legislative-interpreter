My name is Gretchen Greenberg and I live in Portland, Maine.  I love to walk, bike, 
sail, snowshoe and generally enjoy the outdoors.  I recently returned from a trip to 
Washington state to visit two daughters who now live outside Seattle.  Washington, 
like Maine, abounds with outdoor recreational opportunities.  Nothing beats the 
Maine coastline, in my opinion.  Washington, however, has got Maine beat when it 
comes to off road bike/walking trails.  I was so happy to be biking on a long bike trail 
with no worry of cars and trucks.  The trails are extensive!  I biked a section of the 
Palouse to Cascade 250 mile trail, and 20 of 32 miles of the Snoqualmie Valley Trail. 
How I wish I could do that in Maine!  Both these aforementioned trails are rail trails - 
former railroad lines that are no longer use. Why can't we develop these options for 
Maine?  Rail trails offer safe biking and walking experiences for all ages, from young 
to old folks like me.  Please support this legislation that will allow this development 
to go forward.  I may not benefit, but the next generation will.
