I believe a multi use trail such as this would be enourmously helpful. I have ridden a 
bicycle between Portland, Brunswick and Auburn many times and frankly it is 
difficult simply to find a route that is safe, let alone pleasureable to pass through on a 
bicycle. It would be I think an excellent decision to use the presently un-utilised right 
of way that is an abondonned railroad to promote safe, sustainable transportation, 
recreation, meaningful outdoor experiences and to expand the access to public space 
that makes Maine the place it is!
