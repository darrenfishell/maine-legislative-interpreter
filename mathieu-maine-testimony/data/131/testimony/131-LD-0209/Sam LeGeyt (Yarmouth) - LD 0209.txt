Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Sam LeGeyt and I am a resident of  Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
My family and I would use the trail recreationally, and I would also utilize it as a 
means of transportation to my office in downtown Portland. 
I grew up in Connecticut and remember using the rail trail there as young kid, almost 
daily for after dinner bike rides as a family. I envision doing the same with our 
daughter on the Casco Bay trail. 
These type of trails connect communities and get people outside, enjoying the natural 
beauty that Maine has to offer, as well as keeping people healthy. 
Thank you.
Sam LeGeyt
