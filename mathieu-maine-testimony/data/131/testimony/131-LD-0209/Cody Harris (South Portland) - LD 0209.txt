I am an active person (cycling, running, etc) who currently lives and grew up in 
Maine. I was lucky enough to live for a few years in the northern Virginia/DC area 
whose great network of Rail Trail systems helped me stay active and subsequently 
mentally stable. I highly support Maine choosing to construct a similar system as the 
human ecosystem it creates goes beyond just my limited interests.
Anyone who travels along anyone of the Rail Trail systems down in the greater DC 
area can quickly see the vast number of people benefiting from the system. This 
includes, but not limited to: commuters, walkers, cyclists, runners, kids, families, bird 
watchers, hikers, nature lovers, skate boarders, roller bladers, and those that enjoy the 
fresh air and the escape from the hustle and bustle of the city setting including cars.
