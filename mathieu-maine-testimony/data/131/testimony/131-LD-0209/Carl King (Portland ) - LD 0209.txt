Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Carl King and I am a resident of Portland and a former resident of 
Falmouth. I am writing to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed 
amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to 
Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory 
Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.  My residence at Veranda would give me great access
to the trail and the towns north of me.  I am an avid cyclist and have been riding the 
roads of Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, and Freeport for 20+ years.  I ride 3-4 
times a week and have seen an increase in road traffic in the past decade and having a 
safe alternative would be welcomed by cyclists and motorists alike.
The Eastern trail south of Portland is a great example on what a great addition a trail 
system, like the one proposed, is for the local communities.  I hope we can all come 
together and agree the many benefits of such a trail system would bring for years and 
generations to come.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Carl King
