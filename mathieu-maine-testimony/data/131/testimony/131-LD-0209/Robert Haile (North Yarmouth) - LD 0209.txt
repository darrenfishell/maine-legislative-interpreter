Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Robert Haile and I am a resident of North Yarmouth. In fact I live 
directly across the street from the rail corridor in question.  I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community and across the street from me would be 
an incredible resource for me, my family, and my community.
I currently commute by bicycle on North Rd. into Yarmouth for work and shopping.  
Commuting on a dedicated trail would be a safer alternative to riding on North Rd. 
which is heavily traveled during peak commuter hours.  My family (two boys and my 
wife) would also use the trail for exercise and to see the many parks or preserves that 
the trail would run through or near.
I have lived at my current address for almost 11 years.  It has been at least nine years 
since I last saw a locomotive on this rail corridor.  Area residents use the line for dog 
walking, hiking, XC-skiing, and fat tire biking now.  I urge the committee to 
formalize the current use of this line by supporting Rep. Bell's amendment to LD 209.
Thank you.
Robert Haile
