Cumberland Foreside
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Carrie Cianchette and I am a resident of Cumberland, ME. I am writing 
to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, 
to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
My family of 5 are avid cyclists.  We would use this trail frequently, especially on 
weekends.  Connecting our communities with use of outdoor spaces is critical to 
mental health, physical health, and future stewardship of our beautiful state of Maine. 
Thank you.
Carrie
