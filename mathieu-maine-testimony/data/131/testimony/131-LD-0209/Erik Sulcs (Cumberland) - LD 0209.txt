Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Erik Sulcs and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
I would be using the trail with my wife and dog to have an area to exercise safely 
away from vehicular traffic, and we would use the trail at least 2 times a week.
I believe this is a great opportunity for all Mainers, and also a draw for out-of-state 
tourism.
Thank you.
Erik Sulcs
