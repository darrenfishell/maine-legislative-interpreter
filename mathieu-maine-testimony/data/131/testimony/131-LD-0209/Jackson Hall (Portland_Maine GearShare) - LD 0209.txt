Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Jackson Hall and I am a resident of Portland Maine. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
As an avid biker and runner I appreciate being able to recreate on trails right from my 
house in Portland.  Having this trail would be an incredible way to access my family 
in Yarmouth and my workplace in Brunswick without having to bike on busy roads 
shared with cars.  With the increased price of gas, I would like to be able to commute 
more by bike to work in Brunswick but often find myself dreading having to bike on 
busy sections of Route 1 where the speed limit can be 40-50 mph.
While this trail would benefit me personally, I also see the broader benefits of having 
more safe spaces to recreate outside.  In my work, I work for a non-profit called 
Maine GearShare whose mission is to increase access to the outdoors for all.  This 
trail would eliminate some of the access hurdles for people looking to get into biking, 
trail running, or just generally getting outside and going for a walk.
Furthermore there is a potential economic benefit from tourism, this section of trail 
will be part of the 3,000 mile East Coast Greenway. When completed, the East Coast 
Greenway will likely be the most visited park in America. This rail trail, because of 
its location on a major commuting corridor in the state, will be among the most 
heavily used Maine segments, attracting visitors from around the country and world.
Thank you for your time.
Jackson Hall
