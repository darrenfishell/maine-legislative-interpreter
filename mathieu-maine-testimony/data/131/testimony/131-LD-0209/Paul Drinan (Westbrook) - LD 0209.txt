Senator
Chipman,
Representative
Williams,
and
Members
of
the
T ransportation
Committee:
My
name
is
Paul
Drinan
and
I
am
a
resident
of
W estbrook.
I
am
writing
to
testify
in
strong
support
of
Rep.
Bell’ s
proposed
amendment
to
LD
209,
“Resolve,
to
Direct
the
Department
of
T ransportation
to
Implement
the
Recommendation
of
the
Portland
to
Auburn
Rail
Use
Advisory
Council.”
Having
this
rail
trail
through
my
community
would
be
an
incredible
resource
for
me,
my
family ,
and
my
community .
For
years
now ,
I’ve
been
riding
with
friends
and
family
on
roads
that
are
parallel
to
this
corridor
and
there
have
been
countless
occasions
where
we
have
been
put
in
harm's
way
or
felt
unsafe
due
to
traf fic.
Having
a
separated
facility
such
as
the
proposed
Casco
Bay
T rail
would
be
an
incredible
opportunity
for
our
community
to
enjoy
a
car-free
experience.
Having
ridden
rail
trails
in
other
parts
of
the
country ,
I
can
assure
you
these
trails
are
much
more
than
a
recreational
amenity .
These
are
not
stand-alone
projects
but
components
of
what
will
be
regional
active
transportation
and
economic
development
systems.
Also,
key
goals
of
Maine
Department
of
T ransportation’ s
Maine
State
Active
T ransportation
Plan
align
with
the
outcomes
of
LD
209.
These
include:
○
Safe
T ravel 
○
A
V ibrant
Economy 
○
Connectivity 
○
Environmentally
Sustainable
T ransportation
System 
○
Equitable
Access 
○
Healthier
Maine
(which
translates
to
a
healthier
economy)
If,
indeed,
the
State
of
Maine
wants
to
support
economic
impact
opportunities,
equitable
transportation,
environmental
justice,
and
public
health,
a
rail
trail
checks
all
the
boxes.
Climate
change
has
elevated
Maine’ s
active
transportation
imperative
from
desirable
to
essential
and
urgent.
Active
transportation
infrastructure
enables
emission-free
transportation,
outdoor
recreation,
and
improved
public
health.
For
these
reasons,
I
respectfully
urge
you
to
vote
in
favor
of
LD
209.
Thank
you,
Paul
Drinan
