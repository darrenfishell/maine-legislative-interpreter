Biddeford
LD 209
Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Shoshana Hoose and I am a resident of Biddeford. I am writing to testify 
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
I recently moved to Biddeford.  That has given me the opportunity to commute by 
bicycle to my job in Portland at least once a week.  My bicycle commute is on the 
Eastern Trail most of the way.  I have the opportunity to see many people of all ages 
using the trail for exercise, relaxation and to get places.  The proposed rail trail from 
Portland to Auburn would serve the same purpose.
Every summer, my family chooses a vacation destination near a trail where we can 
bicycle.  We have traveled as far as Minnesota because of the excellent trail networks 
in the Midwest.  Extending trails from Kennebunk to Auburn would help Maine 
attract more bicycle tourism to our state.
I urge you support the trail proposal.
Shoshana Hoose
