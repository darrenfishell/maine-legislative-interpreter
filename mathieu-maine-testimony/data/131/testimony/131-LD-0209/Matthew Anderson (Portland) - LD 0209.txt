Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Matthew Anderson and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail up from Portland would be an incredible resource for me, my 
family, and my community.
I am an avid cyclist, and regularly ride in the direction of Auburn.  In fact, several 
times a year I ride to and from Buckfield, where I work as a teacher.  The stretch of 
that ride from Auburn to Portland often has me riding on the Auburn Road, or Route 
100 which is narrow and heavily trafficked.  It's nerve wracking.
I also like to ride with my wife and 13 year old son, who are less experienced riders, 
and I'm always on the lookout for safe routes.  This would be ideal!
Mainers are getting more and more interested in cycling, especially our older 
residents who now have access to e-bikes which have made it possible for them to get
back out if they may have given up on the sport, not to mention hikers and dog 
walkers and so forth.
Thank you.
Matthew A. Anderson
