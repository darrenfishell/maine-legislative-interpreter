Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Stephen Bush and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having a rail trail that connects Portland with Yarmouth and other surrounding 
communities would be an invaluable resource to me, my family, and the entire region.
It would allow me to commute to Portland by bike safely, without having to worry 
about the dangers of sharing lanes with cars.  I used to commute from Yarmouth to 
Portland along route 88 but it did not feel safe and I had numerous close calls with 
distracted or aggressive drivers.
My family also bikes regularly for exercise but we don't feel safe riding with our 
young children (ages 10 and 4) along roads with cars.  As a result, we have to drive to
rail trails in other communities, including in other states, to enjoy the safety and 
peace-of-mind of biking on dedicated trails without cars.  We would love to be able to
access a rail trail from our own community without having to drive to a trail.
Having a rail trail that is accessible to so many communities with large populations 
would encourage more people to get outdoors, get exercise, and walk/bike to their 
destinations instead of using motor vehicles.  This would improve the quality of life, 
health of individual and the community, and reduce emissions from cars.  
I'm confident it would also benefit small businesses and the local economy by 
encouraging visitors t the towns that this rail trail connects.
Thank you for considering my testimony.
Stephen Bush
