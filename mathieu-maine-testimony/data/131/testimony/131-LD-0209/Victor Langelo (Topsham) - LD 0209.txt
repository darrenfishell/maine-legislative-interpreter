Testimony is support of LD 209, “An Act to Authorize an Interim Use Trail on the Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor”Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and honorable members of the Transportation Committee, I am Victor Langelo a resident of Topsham. While I don’t live in a community along this corridor, my wife and I do visit Yarmouth often. We have used the Beth Condon Pathway in Yarmouth several times recently before dinning in nearby restaurants. I would be nice to have a longer safe route we could bicycle while there.I also belong to two area bicycle clubs, The Merrymeeting Wheelers and the Casco Bay Bicycle Club. Both clubs have current routes that could really use a trail in this corridor. A common Saturday ride for the Wheelers is a loop the visits Freeport, Yarmouth, North Yarmouth, Pownal to Pineland Farms in New Gloucester. A trail in this corridor would be a safe off-road alternative in areas where the trafﬁc can be heavy.Of all the areas I commute by bicycle, ﬁnding a safe route from Freeport to Portland is very difﬁcult. The combination of few alternative roads to Rt 1, high trafﬁc volume and narrow roads narrow or no shoulders makes it particularly difﬁcult. Again the Berlin Subdivision corridor would be a huge improvement.I urge the committee to support LD 209.Sincerely,Victor Langelo
