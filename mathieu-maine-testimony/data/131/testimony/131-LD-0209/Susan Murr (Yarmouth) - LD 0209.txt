LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Susan Murr and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
The lure of the outdoors is one of Maine's strongest characteristics.  By allowing this 
type of trail, that lure is strengthened and maintained for us, our children, and visitors 
to Maine who provide an important part of Maine's economy.
Implementing the trail will provide additional environmental protection for 
generations to come and help ensure that the great outdoors of our state is preserved 
in a usable way.
Allowing this trail and other trails of this type allows us, our children and visitors 
additional opportunities to experience the wonderful Maine environment.
The Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Committee has gone through an extensive 
public vetting process to recommend this trail and their work should be supported by 
the passage of this legislation.
Thank you for your consideration.
Respectfully submitted,
Susan Murr
