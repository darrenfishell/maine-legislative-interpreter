I would like to testify in favor of the bill as proposed.  Rail trails have been proven 
across the country to be very popular with a wide range of people who walk and ride 
their bikes.  Rail trails are good for public health and safety, bringing opportunities 
for outside exercise on a safe trail, as well as opportunities to reduce car traffic for 
those who use the rail trails for commuting. Thank you for your consideration of this 
bill.
