Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Gary DiLisio and I am a resident of North Yarmouth. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
This trail runs adjacent to my property.  It would provide connectivity from Portland 
to many more rural areas.  The trail passes close to Pineland and would allow 
non-motor vehicle access to this valuable resource.  I have experienced similar rail to 
trail conversions in Atlanta and Fullerton, California and they have been well used, 
well received and allow for safe connectivity between communities.
There are other options for rail service to Auburn if the need does arise in the future.  
I strongly encourage you to support this bill.
Thank you.
Gary DiLisio
