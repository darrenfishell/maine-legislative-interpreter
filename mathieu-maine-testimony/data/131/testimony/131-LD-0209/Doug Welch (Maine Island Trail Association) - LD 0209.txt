Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Doug Welch and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
My organization, the Maine Island Trail Association (MITA), is a neighbor to the trail
corridor located at the Maine Yacht Center near the old B & M Baked Bean 
plant/Roux Institute. Over the past 35 years MITA has developed one of the foremost 
recreational water trails in the country. Our 9,000 members enjoy daytime and 
overnight access to over 250 islands and coastal sites from Kittery to the Canadian 
border.
A rail trail to the north/west would be an exciting development for our members and 
our mission. The core of our mission is to provide opportunities for recreational 
access to places where it is otherwise lacking. In exchange for this access, MITA 
provides physical stewardship on the islands themselves via our Portland-based staff 
and over 1,000 volunteers each year.
The proposed rail trail would provide new commuting opportunities to my staff of 11,
most of whom live north of Portland. Far more importantly, connection to the rail trail
would create an exciting multimodal transportation hub between the trail's 
pedestrians/joggers/cyclists and the recreational waterfront and islands beyond. This 
recreational connection would be uniquely "Maine" and a serious boon to the greater 
Portland community. We encourage you to implement the plan.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Doug Welch
