LD 209 Testimony 
Deborah Dawson 
15 Sunrise Drive 
Cape Elizabeth 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation Committee: 
My name is Deborah Dawson and I am a resident of Cape Elizabeth. I am here to testify in strong support 
of Representative Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of 
Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory 
Council. ” Having this rail trail would be a tremendously valuable community resource for the residents of 
Auburn, Brunswick, Cumberland, Durham, Falmouth, Freeport, Lewiston, Lisbon, New Gloucester, 
North Yarmouth, Portland, Pownal, Topsham, and Yarmouth. 
Through the years I have witnessed the transformative beneﬁts to several communities where bike paths 
have been built. While I lived in West Bath, The Androscoggin River Bicycle Path from Brunswick to 
Cooks Corner was built. This gave area residents a safe place to walk, run, bicycle and even commute. 
Before this path was built there was only the four lane section of Route l or narrow side roads with no 
shoulder that forced the cyclists to share the lane with fast moving vehicle trafﬁc. Now, living in the 
Portland area, I frequently use the many off-road trails available including the South Portland Greenbelt 
and Eastern Trail to bicycle for recreation and running errands. On these trails, I’m joined by many 
families, dog walkers, runners and commuters —all enjoying the beneﬁt of being able to safely walk, run 
or cycle away from our narrow and busy streets. 
I feel that the decision to amend LD 209 in support of a rail trail is a matter of our responsibility to 
improve the wellbeing and safety of the communities served. 
Thank you, 
Deborah Dawson
