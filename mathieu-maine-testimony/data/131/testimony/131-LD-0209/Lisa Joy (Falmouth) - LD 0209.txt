Good morning,
I live across the road from concerned abutters and share concerns that:
- many were not notified of this public hearing
- compensating them for easements is not part of the plan.
My concerns are first about unsheltereds inevitably choosing an easy-access, 
unmonitored bike path to use for encampments as Portland cracks down on tent cities.
It’s not feasible for local police to manage such developments in an ongoing manner.
Secondly, I’m concerned when municipal and state government are more influenced 
by regional authorities and special interests than by non-affiliated community 
residents’ opinion of record.
The benefits of trails are broad and desireable, but not without risks. This rail trail 
through several communities benefits bikers, to be sure, yet carries risks about 
potential easy invasions of privacy (and worse) to abutters and neighbors.
Survey Monkey or well-publicized meetings in each community are cost-effective 
means of gathering resident opinions. Surveys can be easily emailed to town email 
lists. Their results and those of community meetings easily published. Such should be 
weighed before legislative action occurs.
 
Until I see engagement with residents of my border town, I will have unease and 
concerns will remain.
 
Thank you,
Lisa Joy
