Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Aura Russell-Bedder. I'm a resident of the East Deering neighborhood in 
Portland, and serve as a member of the Portland Board of Education. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for a 
portion of the city of Portland that is lacking in public recreational spaces. 
The prospect of a Casco Bay trail, in the Presumpscot school neighborhood, for 
families to use for walking to school, and riding bikes for recreation in a safe setting, 
is so exciting. 
Thank you for your consideration.
Aura Russell-Bedder
