Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Vanessa Bryant, and I am a resident of North Yarmouth. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
As a land abutter I am 100% in favor of having this rail trail through my community 
and believe it would be an incredible resource for me, my family, and my community.
We live approximately, 15 minutes to downtown Yarmouth, which not only provides 
a public transportation into Portland, but a variety of opportunities form me and my 
children to experience. We would also use the trail to bike to Pineland Farms and 
beyond. But the main road - North Rd is extremely busy and frankly unsafe for 
walkers and bikers.
In-addition, a lot of the developments in the area off of the North Road converting the
rails to trails would allow my children to easily commute to friends' homes in the 
surrounding areas.
