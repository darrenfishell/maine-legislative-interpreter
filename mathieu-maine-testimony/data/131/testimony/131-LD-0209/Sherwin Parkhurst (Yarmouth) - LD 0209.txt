LD 209
Sherwin & Kristen Parkhurst 39 Riverfront Dr. Yarmouth, Maine  Senator 
Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation Committee:
  My name is Sherwin Parkhurst and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”  Having this rail trail through my
community would be an incredible resource for me, my family, and my community.
  My wife and I are avid runners and lived by a similar trail previously in 
Newfields New Hampshire, the Rockingham Recreational Rail Trail. It was 
transformative to our family. We would often run the trail, walk it with our dog, and 
eventually are two young kids. Our kids would use it to bike safely and enjoy nature. 
  To be honest, we would likely use the rail trail every single day in numerous 
forms. It would be accessible at the end of our neighborhood in Yarmouth and I 
would likely run on it daily. Our family would walk it during all the seasons and my 
kids would probably bike on it, including to commute to school given it would help us
largely avoid the roads.   A rail trail is such an asset to a community for people to 
commute to Portland, exercise safely, and be able to enjoy nature. There are limitless 
possibilities to connect with other trail networks and I can’t think of a more positive 
and transformative project than adopting this plan to make this unused railroad a rail 
trail, especially since other rail lines exist to facilitate rail travel to Lewiston / Auburn.
  Thank you,
Sherwin and Kristen Parkhurst
