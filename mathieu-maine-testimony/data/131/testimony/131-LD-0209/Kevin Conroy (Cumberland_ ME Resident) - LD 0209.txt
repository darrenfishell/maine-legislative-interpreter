Conroy LD 209 Testimony

Cumberland, ME 04021 
 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee: 
 
My name is Kevin Conroy and I am a resident of Cumberland, along with my wife and 
two young children. I am writing to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed 
amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to 
Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.” 
 
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, my 
family, and my community. 
 
We would be directly impacted by the rail trail as would run through our backyard. We 
fully support Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment as it would have a monumentally positive 
impact to the surrounding communities. The trail would encourage healthy habits, 
provide another option for recreational enjoyment, encourage tourism and business and 
much more. 
 
Without the Transportation Committee’s support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment, 
the otherwise ‘dead space’ is left to continue to be wasteful space. Please don’t miss 
this opportunity to create inter-community connections! 
 
 
Respectfully, 
Kevin Conroy
