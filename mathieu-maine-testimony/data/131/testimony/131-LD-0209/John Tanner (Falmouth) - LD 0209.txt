My name is John Tanner and I am an advocate for the Cisco Bay Rail Trail for the 
following reasons.
It will be a dedicated safe place for commuters and families to ride explore together. 
Health benefits, for fitness enthusiast and those who want to become more fit. The 
trail would be an additional place to observe nature.
I also believe that the Cisco Bay Trail will have a positive impact on the environment.
Once the trail is completed, it would become a destination for outdoor enthusiast and 
it will help drive Maine tourism.
Thank you for your consideration, ride On!
