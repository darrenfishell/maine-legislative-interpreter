Stephen Hayes
Falmouth
LD 209
My name is Stephen Hayes and I am resident of Falmouth. I am writing to offer my 
strong support for Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
I believe this project would enrich the lives of those in our communities and state. My
family and I would use this trail for recreation and as a commuting corridor between 
Falmouth and adjacent towns. I enjoy bicycling and I would use this corridor several 
times a week as a safe alternative to riding on the roads.  
I can see this project providing a great venue for families to enjoy outdoor activity 
and I really believe this project would allow us to enjoy all our part of the state has to 
offer.
I am a physician and have grown increasingly aware of how the built environment 
impacts the health of individuals and communities.  What a great way to make Maine 
an even healthier place to live!
Thank you for your consideration of this project.
Stephen Hayes
