LD 209
Hello,
I support the passing of LD 209: An Act to Authorize an Interim Use Trail on the 
Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor A Rail Use Advisory Council (RUAC). Rail trails 
are a great resource for public walking and bike riding, and I've enjoyed them 
extensively in other states. It would be excellent to add more of these in my home 
state of Maine. I support the transition of unused rail to trail. Thank you.
