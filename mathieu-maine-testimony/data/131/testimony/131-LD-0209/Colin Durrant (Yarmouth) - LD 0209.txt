Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation Committee:  
 
As members of the Yarmouth Bicycle and Pedestrian Committee, we are writing to express 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail 
Use Advisory Council.”  
 
The Casco Bay Trail would provide a once -in-a-lifetime opportunity to connect S outhern Maine 
communities via a world -class walking and biking trail that would promote economic 
development, reduce pollution and traffic congestion, and encourage healthy activity.   
 
Notably, this trail would instantly become a key transportation corrido r for Southern Maine, 
providing numerous benefits beyond the obvious recreational benefits, including as an 
affordable, long -distance route for commuting, running errands, and other everyday activities.  
 
Importantly, the trail would also provide a safe and  accessible route for all ages and abilities. 
Just last month, elementary school students submitted a letter to our committee expressing 
dismay that they do not have a safe route to bike or walk to school. They live in an area of town 
that would connect di rectly to the Casco Bay Trail, providing them a safe route to school and 
other activities.  
 
The Committee and residents of Yarmouth have long supported the concept of the Casco Bay 
Trail, advocating for it as early as 2010. The Casco Bay Trail is one of th e most important 
pieces of planned biking and walking infrastructure within the region, connecting our town 
center to other surrounding towns. It realizes one of the principal regional connectivity goals laid 
out in the 2014 PACTS funded Portland Area Nort h Bicycle & Pedestrian Implementation Plan 
and provides an important safe connectivity corridor from Portland to Auburn.   
 
The increase in demand for safe walking and biking infrastructure, combined with the need to 
act on climate change by reducing transp ortation emissions, makes this the perfect time for 
MaineDOT to collaborate with the towns along the future trail to build the Casco Bay Trail.   
 

The Casco Bay Trail also has the potential to generate significant economic activity in Yarmouth 
and its neigh boring towns along the trail. The trail will offer a safe, off -road alternative to driving 
along our busy highways, and will thereby increase foot traffic to existing and future businesses 
along the route. Further, it will serve as a gateway for bikers and  pedestrians on the East Coast 
Greenway and those connecting to the West Side Trail in Yarmouth.    
 
The Yarmouth Bicycle and Pedestrian Committee strongly urges you to approve Rep. Bell’s 
proposed amendment to LD 209.   
 
Thank you for your con sideration,  
 
Colin Durrant, Chair  
Mike Tremblay, Vice Chair
