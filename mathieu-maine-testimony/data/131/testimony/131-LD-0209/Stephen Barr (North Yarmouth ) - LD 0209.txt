I write you in support of LD 209.
In SO many ways, this is the right decision!Here we have a tremendous asset that 
connects rural communities with high density metropolitan areas. With the advent of 
E bikes, this provides an amazing opportunity for safe recreation, a commuting 
corridor, exploration of the out-of-doors, and use of an community asset that sits idle.
Please work quickly and with purpose to make this a reality for the State of Maine, its
residents and its visitors!
