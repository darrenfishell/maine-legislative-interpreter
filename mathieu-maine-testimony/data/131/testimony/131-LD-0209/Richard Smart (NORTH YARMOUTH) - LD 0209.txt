LD 209
I am in support of LD 209. I think it makes great use of an excellent unused resource 
while still leaving the option open for other future uses. 
I have lived in other parts of the country that have converted abandoned rail corridors 
to multi-use paths. These paths become great opportunities for recreation, fitness, 
community building, and eco-friendly transportation options. I have also seen many 
small businesses created along these trails to support the users - bike repair/rentals, 
cafes, shops, lodging, etc. 
I live within a mile of the proposed rail-trail and would welcome it in my 
neighborhood. I would use it regularly.
