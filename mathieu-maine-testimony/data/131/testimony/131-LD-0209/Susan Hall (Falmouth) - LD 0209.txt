My testimony is a short one. I ask that you please approve this bill because all of us, 
but especially us old people and children, need need a safe space to get outside in the 
sun year round where we are not having to dodge cars. I ride a bike (not fast) but am 
becoming increasingly afraid of riding on our roads due to near misses with cars and 
trucks. The part of Maine that this trail would cover is becoming increasingly full of 
traffic.  Please vote to increase our quality of life by giving us a safe place to walk, 
run, snowshoe, cross country ski and bicycle.
All you need to do is look at the Eastern Trail, the rail trails in other states and in 
Quebec to see how much the citizens love their “linear parks.” Tourists go to these 
linear parks in droves.
Thank you.
