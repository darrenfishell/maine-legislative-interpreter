As a resident of North Yarmouth I strongly support the creation of a rail trail on the 
Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor. As a cyclist, runner, and walker I would make use 
of the trail several times a week for exercise and dog walking as roads are 
increasingly unsafe for these activities. This is a huge opportunity to provide a safe 
and easy way for residents and visitors, including those with disabilities, to improve 
their mental and physical health on property that would otherwise not have a benefit 
to the public. I would also bike on the trail to other towns on occasion; a collective 
effort to do this would result in improved environmental and economic outcomes for 
the area. Thank you for keeping the well-being of Mainers in mind as you consider 
this proposal.
