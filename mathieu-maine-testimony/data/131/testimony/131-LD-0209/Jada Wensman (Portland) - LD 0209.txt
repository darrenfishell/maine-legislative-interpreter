LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and the members of the Transportation 
Committee,
My name is Jada Wensman and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify in 
support of Rep. Bell's proposed amendment to LD 209. 
The addition of this rail trail to my community would be an incredible resource for 
people of all ages to access the outdoor and recreate safely. As a cyclist I am 
uncomfortably aware of the dangers of riding on the road with cars - I know too many
people who have died this way. Access to safe trails can make a huge difference in 
helping people get outdoors and moving which we all know is a healthy choice! I 
would love to bike from Portland to Auburn, and as my work is in Auburn I could 
even see a part-way commute in the summers to reduce my driving time and make my
mornings a little better. Thank you for your consideration.
