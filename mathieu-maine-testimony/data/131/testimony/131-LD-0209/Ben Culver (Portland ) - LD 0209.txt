As a Maine resident, living in Portland, I an writing today to express my most 
enthusiastic support for authorizing trail use in this rail corridor. I firmly believe that 
providing more and better options for people to explore, travel, commute and connect 
in our state is one of the best ways forward we can easily provide. This type of 
infrastructure is overdue and necessary, and the benefits are innumerable.
