Tom Reeves
Gardiner
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Tom Reeves and I live in Gardiner and strongly support the passage of 
LD 209 which would authorize the construction of a rail trail between Portland and 
Auburn. Having this trail would not only benefit the communities along it but would 
also draw visitors from across Maine and out of state.  Maine needs more active 
transportation trails and what better way than to connect the state's two largest 
communities.
