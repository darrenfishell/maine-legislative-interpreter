FALMOUTH
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Julie Scammell and I am a resident of  Falmouth. I am writing to testify 
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.  My family and I are enthusiastic cyclists and would 
love a safe place, away from traffic, to ride our bikes.  In Falmouth you take you life 
in your hands when either walking, running or biking because there are small or no 
shoulders to the roads.
I experienced a similar project in a friend's town in upstate New York.  She showed 
me how simple stopping points along the trail had popped up to offer quick 
refreshments.  It was a very enjoyable and SAFE  bike ride.
Thank you.
Julie Scammell
