Dear Legislators,
As an avid biker in Maine for the entirety of my 44 years in this beautiful state, I 
encourage you to approve this legislation. Adding a protected multi-use trail 
connecting Portland to Auburn through the towns in between will help all of the 
communities it touches to increase goodwill, tourism and interest in those 
communities. This trail will allow people to have access to these towns in a whole 
new way, why fight traffic when you can ride into Portland? It may help take some 
vehicles off the road during peak rush times and thereby decrease congestion and 
increase commuter happiness. 
In conclusion voting yes to this bill will allow Maine to increase tourism and decrease
traffic congestion along our busiest roads and highway.
