LD 209
Greetings,
My name is Lee Larson and I am a resident of Falmouth. I am writing in support of 
Rep. Bell's proposed amendment to LD 209, "Resolve, to Direct the Department of 
Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use
Advisory Council". 
I am an avid walker, runner, and biker as is my entire family. We would regularly use 
the trail for these activities. I feel it is imperative to have protected trails for both 
leisure and commuting. Distracted drivers and increased in traffic throughout 
Cumberland County is a constant safety threat to people on foot and on bikes. A rail 
trail would allow people to safely travel through Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, 
Yarmouth, and several other towns. I know my family would use the trail year round 
and I believe thousands of Maine residents would as well.
I can say with certainty that there is an economic benefit to creating the rail trail in 
Cumberland and Androscoggin counties. I have used rail trails in MA, RI, DC, VA, 
GA, OH, MI, AZ, OR, and WA. I have traveled to many of these states to specifically
ride the trails. Many cyclists want the same thing as I do: to safely ride a bike in 
beautiful parts of the country. I believe people would travel to Maine to spend time 
and money and ride this rail trail. Hotels, restaurants, and other businesses would 
benefit as a result. I have also seen substantial economic growth where rail trails have 
been created. The Atlanta Beltline is a great example of business development as a 
result of a rail trail. Many businesses have popped up adjacent to the trail in the last 
five years.  
I ask the legislature to approve LD 209 so Maine residents and visitors can safely 
enjoy the beauty of our state while walking, running, or biking for leisure or 
commuting. I am confident he economic benefits of creating the trail will be realized 
in short order.
Thank you for your consideration.
Lee Larson
