Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Deborah Bastian and I am a resident of New Gloucester, ME.  I am 
writing to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, 
“Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.  
We would use this trail for walking, biking, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.  It
would also be a wonderful trail for walking our dog.  We would use this trail three to 
five times a week.
It would also be a safe and inexpensive option for some folks to bike to work.
I strongly encourage the Transportation Committee to authorize a rail trail to connect 
Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, North Yarmouth, Pownal, New 
Gloucester and Auburn.
Thank you for your consideration.
