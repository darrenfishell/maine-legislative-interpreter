Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is David Price and I am a resident of North Yarmouth, Maine. I am writing 
to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, 
to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through our community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and our community. 
We live on a road that connects to North Road which is often very busy with traffic. 
Going for long walks from our house is very difficult so we have to drive for miles to 
find a place. If the rail line could be converted to a trail it would be an immense 
improvement to our community. 
I could use the trail to go for a good run.  Our family could go for long walks getting 
fresh air, good exercise. 
The trail provides access to other adjacent neighborhoods so no doubt we would meet 
to new neighbors we would otherwise never know.
I estimate we would use the trail approximately once a week.
The trail would do much more than just promote good exercise and fresh air (which is
great). It also allows us to meet new friends, which would most certainly enhance our 
community.
Walking along North Road is dangerous so no one does it unless it’s an emergency. 
Having the trail provides a pleasant space to access nature directly. 
Thank you.
