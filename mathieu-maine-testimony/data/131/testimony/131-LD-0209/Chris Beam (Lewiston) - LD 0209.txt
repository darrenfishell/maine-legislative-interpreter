Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Chris Beam and I am a resident of Lewiston.
I am writing to express my strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 
209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail from Portland to the Lewiston/Auburn area would be an 
incredible resource for the community.
I have seen at first hand similar trails, for example, along the Kennebec River 
between Augusta and Gardiner  and the Washington and Old Dominion trail in 
northern Virginia.  They are great infrastructure projects and enhance the value of 
their neighborhoods.
As an avid hiker and walker, I would be eager to use such a trail for walking in the 
fall, spring and summer and for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter.
I hope the Committee will give this bill serious consideration and endorse its 
objectives.
Thank you.
Chris Beam
