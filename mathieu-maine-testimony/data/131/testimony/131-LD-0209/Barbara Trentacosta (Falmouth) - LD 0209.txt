Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee: 
 
As stated above, my name is Barbara Trentacosta. I am a resident of Falmouth. I am 
writing/zooming to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 
209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.” 
 
I have been an avid cyclist for 40 years. I have lived in North Yarmouth, Yarmouth, 
Cumberland and now Falmouth. I have ridden most roads in all these communities, as 
well as statewide and abroad. Early spring through October, I ride about 4 days/week.  
 
I have seen the increase in automobile traffic over the years and have learned to ride 
safely alongside cars. However, I choose my routes carefully, using roads with bike 
lanes or wide shoulders whenever I can. This protected trail would be a treasure. 
 
I would LOVE a nearby trail! I would use it for many of my local rides---at least 2 or 3 
times/week.  I also ride with other cyclists weekly and we, too, would ride this rail trail. 
 
Moreover, I have friends who no longer cycle because they are fearful in traffic. They 
would eagerly get back on their bikes if we had this trail. And we’d all be healthier. 
Those who restrict themselves to spin classes even in summer would get outside in 
Maine’s fresh air, unafraid of motorists. 
 
Please implement Representative Art Bell’s amendment for the enjoyment and health of 
our community members. 
 
 
Thank you.
