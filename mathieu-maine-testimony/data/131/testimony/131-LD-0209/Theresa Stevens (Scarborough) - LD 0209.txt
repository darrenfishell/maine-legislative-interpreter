Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Theresa Stevens  and I am a resident of  Scarborough . I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
I am an avid cyclist and  would use this rail trail to ride my bike on. This rail trail 
would provide a safe place to cycle without the concerns of motor vehicles.  
I currently reside near the Eastern Trail (rail trail)  in Scarborough and use this trail at 
least a couple times a week year round for cycling  and walking .  During the  winter I
also use the trail  for cross country skiing and riding my fat tire bike . I used  this rail 
trail to ride my bike to my job when I was working in Saco . I am grateful for the 
safety that this rail trail provides as  a dedicated trail with no motor vehicles .
The rail trail from Portland to Auburn could provide similar  opportunities for outdoor
family  activities such as  biking, walking, and  running , and also a safe means for  
commuting on a bike  to work while  enjoying Maine’s  great outdoors.  
Please support LD 209  and move forward with the  implementation of a  rail trail 
from Portland to Auburn. 
Thank you.
Theresa Stevens
