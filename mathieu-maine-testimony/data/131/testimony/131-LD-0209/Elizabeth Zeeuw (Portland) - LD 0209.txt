Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Elizabeth Zeeuw and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify in
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
We bike as a family as often as possible, but the options for safe places to ride with 
young children, protected from cars, are hard to find around Portland. This trail would
be an incredible gift to the community, especially families who can't travel far but 
want to be outside riding (safely) together. 
Given our interest in biking, we would use this trail on at least a weekly basis between
the months of April and November. 
Thank you,
Elizabeth
