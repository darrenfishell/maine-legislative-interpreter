LD 209
Rail trail
I wish to express my support for LD 209. I am strongly in favor of converting the 
unused St. Lawrence and Atlantic railway corridor to a recreational rail trail for 
several reasons. 
Rail trails encourage healthy lifestyles for people of all ages and all walks of life. 
Rail trails can contribute to economic development, encouraging tourism and offering
new business opportunities such as bike rental, lodging and food service. 
Rail trails are considered a desirable amenity that can help boost property values in 
adjacent communities. 
Finally, I believe we need to support non-motorized alternative transportation within 
our community whenever we have the chance. 
My husband and I find ourselves gravitating more and more toward off-road 
bicycling, walking and running. We would expect to use the trail regularly for 
year-round outdoor exercise. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide input.
