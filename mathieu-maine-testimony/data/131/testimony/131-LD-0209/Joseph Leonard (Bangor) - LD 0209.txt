Dear members of the Transportation Committee,
I am here today as a passenger rail subject matter expert to express my deep concerns 
regarding the proposed legislation to replace rail tracks with a bicycle path. While I 
understand the importance of promoting alternative modes of transportation and 
addressing climate change, I must emphasize that proceeding with this plan would be 
a grave mistake. It would not only constitute economic malpractice but also 
perpetuate an elitist agenda that neglects the needs of disadvantaged communities and
relies on fabricated data from organizations such as Maine DOT, the bicycle coalition,
and trail organizations.
Firstly, it is imperative to recognize that dismantling rail tracks without a 
comprehensive assessment of their economic benefits and long-term value would 
display a disturbing lack of foresight. Rail transportation is a key driver of economic 
growth and connectivity, facilitating efficient and reliable movement of passengers 
and goods. By removing rail infrastructure, we deprive communities of the economic 
advantages that it provides, undermining businesses, trade, and tourism.
Furthermore, replacing rail tracks with a bicycle path may appear to be a sustainable 
initiative, but it is crucial to question the integrity of the data and motivations behind 
such a proposal. Organizations like Maine DOT, the bicycle coalition, and trail 
organizations have been caught fabricating data to support their biased agendas. 
Trusting such sources without scrutiny would be reckless and irresponsible.
Moreover, this approach promotes an elitist activity that caters primarily to wealthy 
individuals, leaving those suffering from economic poverty behind. Passenger rail 
services form an essential part of a comprehensive and inclusive transportation 
network. Eliminating rail tracks restricts the potential for future rail expansion, 
limiting transportation options for commuters and travelers from all walks of life. It is
vital to consider the diverse needs of our communities and ensure equitable access to 
reliable transportation services.
Lastly, combating climate change demands a holistic approach that encompasses 
various strategies. Passenger rail is widely acknowledged as one of the most 
energy-efficient and environmentally friendly modes of transportation. It significantly
reduces carbon emissions and eases traffic congestion. By tearing up rail tracks, we 
not only impede ongoing efforts to mitigate climate change but also hinder future 
opportunities to expand rail infrastructure and foster sustainable transportation 
systems.
Instead of pursuing this misguided path, I implore the committee to explore 
alternative approaches that prioritize the integration and enhancement of existing 
transportation systems. For instance, developing greenways alongside rail tracks can 
allow for the coexistence of cycling and rail transportation, fostering sustainable 
mobility while preserving crucial rail infrastructure. This approach promotes a 
balanced and inclusive transportation network that caters to the diverse needs of our 
communities.
In conclusion, proceeding with the legislation to rip up rail tracks up to 30 miles in 
length and replace them with a bicycle path would be an alarming display of 
negligence. It would constitute economic malpractice, perpetuate an elitist agenda, 
and rely on questionable data from organizations with vested interests. I urge the 
committee to reconsider this proposal and instead seek alternative solutions that 
promote sustainability, economic growth, and equitable transportation access for all.
Thank you for your attention.
