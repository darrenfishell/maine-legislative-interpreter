Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Nancy Martin and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community. I work in Portland and would love the possibility of 
biking to work. Moreover, my kids love to bike and we often go biking on the 
weekend as a fun family outing. Having the trail right here in town would also bring 
economic opportunity to the businesses on Main Street. 
Thank you,
Nancy Martin
