My name is Emily Cartwright and I live in Cumberland, ME. I am writing to express 
my support for the use of the corridor as a trail. I support it for all the reasons you will
hear from others about the benefits for recreation and the benefit of commuting. And 
in my particular situation, I support it also for youth sports. I coach cross country 
skiing year-round with youth athletes that live locally to this proposed rail trail. You 
may have seen us on the roads on our rollerskis. We try to ski on dead-end 
neighborhoods or less-trafficked roads with lower speed limits, but we know it's not 
fully safe to be training on the roads. Both ourselves and the cars who come across us 
would like for skiers to be off the roads. I am sure there are other sports who also 
might use this rail trail with their teams. So another purpose for the proposed trail is 
for it to be used by youth student-athletes. It would be an excellent improvement to 
our safety. I am very excited for this potential gem to our area. Thank you for your 
time and consideration.
