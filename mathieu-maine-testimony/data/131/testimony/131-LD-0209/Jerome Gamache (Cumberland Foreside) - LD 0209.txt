Jerome Gamache
Cumberland Foreside
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Jerome Gamache and I am a resident of Cumberland Foreside. I am 
writing to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, 
“Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council. 
I have biked to work on and off for years, and each year the portions along the roads 
have become more dangerous. So this project would create a great space for 
recreation, it will also make it safer, and thus increase the number of folks who are 
willing to commute into Portland by bike.
Thank you
