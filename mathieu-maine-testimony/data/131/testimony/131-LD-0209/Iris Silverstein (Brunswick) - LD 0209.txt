Brunswick
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Iris Silverstein and I am a resident of Brunswick. I am writing to testify 
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
As a biker (aged/retired) I would use this trail for safe recreation.  I can imagine 
myself riding several times a week.  
A lot of resources are needed to develop trails.  All those resources are worth it, as 
these trails live in to the future and support communities long term.  
Thank you for your hard work and consideration of my testimony. 
Iris Silverstein
