I am writing in support of the proposed amendment to convert 26.5 miles of the 
Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor to an interim bicycle and pedestrian trail.  I lived for 
45 years in Missouri, which has the longest developed rail trail in the country, the 
Katy Trail.  I had the pleasure of riding the entire length of the trail, about 226 miles. (
It took us four days.)  It was wonderful to be in nature, to see the varying landforms 
and vegetation, to ride through the small towns and larger cities.  But the best part 
was visiting the many small businesses (restaurants, lodgings, microbreweries, 
campgrounds) along the way and the people who run them.  Based on this experience,
I strongly encourage Maine to develop similar trails and encourage the businesses that
will spring up to serve them.
Thank you.
