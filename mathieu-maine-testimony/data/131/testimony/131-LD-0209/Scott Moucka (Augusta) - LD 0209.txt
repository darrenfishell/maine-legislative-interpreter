Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Scott Moucka and I am a resident of Augusta. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of all the bills being heard today. I am in support of LD 209, which 
would allow the Department of Transportation to permit an interim bicycle and 
pedestrian trail on 26.5 miles of the inactive Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor, while 
preserving the corridor for future rail. 
I am also in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a 
trail & LD 1450 to help fund the building of the Mountain Division trail.
Having these rail trails connecting communities in Maine would be an incredible 
resource for me, my family, and the state. I believe the best use for these state-owned 
corridors is a trail and I support funding for trail systems such as these. Connected 
trails such as these will connect people to each other and to our natural places, 
providing a car-free alternative to get active outdoors and to get where we need to go.
Numerous states throughout all regions of the country are converting their unused rail 
corridors to trails. These trails, especially when they are connected to others, can 
serve as a huge tourism draw and revenue generator. In fact, I plan to travel out of 
state to ride the 300+ mile long C&O Canal Towpath and GAP trails between 
Pittsburgh and Washington DC later this year.
Maine has the opportunity to develop a similar trail system and these trails under 
consideration today are the start of that vision.
Thank you,
Scott Moucka
