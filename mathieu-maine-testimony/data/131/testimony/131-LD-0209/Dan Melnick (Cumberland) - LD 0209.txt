Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Dan Melnick and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am  writing to testify 
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community. 
It would create a safe place for my children to ride their bikes for miles without fear 
of cars and trucks, and connect many families with safe corridor. 
We would use the trail year round, and utilize it daily during the warmer months. 
Additionally,  the trail would allow us to replace many car trips with bicycle trips to 
improve the environment.
Thank you.
Dan Melnick
