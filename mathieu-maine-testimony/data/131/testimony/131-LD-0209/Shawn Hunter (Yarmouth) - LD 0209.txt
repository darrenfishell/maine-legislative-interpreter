Yarmouth
LD 209
Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Shawn Hunter and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am giving strong 
support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.
This initiative offers tremendous social benefits. It would provide a safe, inclusive 
space for outdoor activities and non-motorized transportation, fostering physical 
fitness, mental well-being, and community bonds.
Environmentally, the rail trail would protect local ecosystems and wildlife habitats, 
while promoting sustainable travel, thereby reducing carbon emissions and 
contributing to the fight against climate change.
Economically, the trail could invigorate our local economy. It would stimulate 
tourism, increase property values, create jobs, and provide opportunities for local 
businesses, from bike rentals to cafes.
In conclusion, converting this unused railway corridor into a public rail trail presents 
a unique opportunity to enhance community health, environmental stewardship, and 
economic growth. I strongly urge you to endorse this transformational project.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Shawn Hunter, Yarmouth Resident
