Having biked for sixty years, a resident of Falmouth, I ethusiastically support the 
formation of the Casco Bay rail trail. My reasons are simple, the easier grade enables 
older bikers to continue to ride after road riding becomes too difficult or dangerous. It
presents a great pedestrian way for the very young in carriages and people who now 
must rely on wheelchairs or other assistive devices.It raises the value of housing 
nearby because of the proximity of a safe and quiet path nearby. And it connects 
communities allowing a safe venue for revenue raising through organized fundraising 
walks/runs/and rides.
