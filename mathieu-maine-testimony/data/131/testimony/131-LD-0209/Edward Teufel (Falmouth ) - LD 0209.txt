Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Edward Teufel and I am a resident of Falmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
Although our Maine towns are wonderful places to live, in general they are not walker
friendly.  The lack of sidewalks really limits the ability to walk or bike safely.  
Having access to a trail such as the one proposed would be a great benefit for our 
daily family walks.
Most importantly, it would provide the thousands of residents of our community a 
resource to get out and exercise more.  I have been a cardiologist in the Portland and 
Augusta areas for 24 years, and spend much of my time encouraging people to walk 
more, as daily walking decreases the risk of heart disease as much as quitting 
smoking.  Every day I hear people say that there is no place safe to walk.  I saw first 
hand a significant increase in my patients exercise routines when the 
Hallowell-Gardiner rail trail was built.  I know the same thing will happen in the 
Portland to Freeport area as well if we build this trail.  This will have a direct, positive
health benefit for our community as has been shown in many towns around the 
country that have built similar trails.
Thank you for your consideration,
Edward Teufel
