Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Daniel Bannon and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am writing to testify
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
The proposed rail trail would provide excellent recreational opportunities for the 
communities and the surrounding region, and would provide a needed corridor for 
safe bicycle commuting between Portland and North of Portland communities.  The 
benefits of this rail trail cannot be understated.
Thank you.
Daniel Bannon
