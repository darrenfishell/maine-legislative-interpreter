LD 209
I am writing to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 
209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.” As a 
resident of Yarmouth and former resident of the Netherlands, I have experienced the 
personal and community value of bicycle and pedestrian trails that are protected from 
automobile traffic and therefore protect people from accidents with cars.  I am excited
for the prospect of a trail connecting Portland to Auburn and the opportunities that 
such a corridor would unlock for commuting, community engagement, shopping, and 
recreation for local residents and visitors alike.  We have the great fortune to live in a 
beautiful place.  Thank you, Ian Voparil, Yarmouth, ME
