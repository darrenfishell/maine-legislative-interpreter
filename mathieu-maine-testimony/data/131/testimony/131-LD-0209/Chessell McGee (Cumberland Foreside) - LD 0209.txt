LD 209
I am writing in Support of LD209 connecting Portland to Auburn via an unused 
railway. I am a citizen of Maine and have been riding the roads from Lubec to Kittery
since I was a young girl. Everywhere I ride, I ride knowing that I may be harassed or 
even injured by riding my bike on the roadway. I love riding the Eastern Trail because
I know it is safe and it is enjoyed by hundreds of people, either walking or cycling. 
This small trail is a huge example of what could be possible. I also enjoy riding the 
Sunrise Trail, though wish that like the Eastern Trail, motorized vehicles such as 
ATVs were not allowed on the trail, but at least it is getting used by citizens of those 
towns.  To connect this unused railway to Auburn would allow many people the 
option not only to use the trails for pleasure and exercise, but also for commuting to 
work. Please consider voting for this bill!
Thank you!
