The Casco Bay Trail  is a fantastic once in a lifetime opportunity whose time has  
come.  I am  a  family   doctor  who  has  practiced in   Portland for  30 years. I may  
be the only  person to testify today who actually rides on  part of the  rail  corridor in 
their daily commute. I ride  my  bike  year  round  to my office  at  Martin's Point  in  
Portland. When conditions are right, I ski to work
The other day  on   my  ride home I passed  a  young  boy just  learning to  ride his  
bike on   residential side street  in East Deering. Imagine  how good it  would  be if  
he could continue  his ride  on  a paved  and  protected path without fear of   getting  
hit  by  a car.
It's snow  bird  season in my  office.  Many of my  patients  have  returned  from  
winters in Florida. A common  complaint is  that have  no safe  place  to   ride or  
walk  when they are home here in Maine. A path  extending  from Portland to  
Yarmouth and  beyond would be an ideal option for them. As  I ride along  Middle  
Road in  Falmouth and  Cumberland parallel to the  rail tracks, there are NO 
sidewalks, only  a narrow  shoulder. Would you want your parent or child walking 
those  roads?  There  is little margin  for  safety on the sides of  roads. 
I grew up in New Jersey, and ironically I  felt  safer  rider  down there  than here in 
Maine, because of  wider shoulders, dedicated bike paths and more  sidewalks.
We can do  better than  Florida or New Jersey. The  Casco Bay Trail has tremendous 
potential for  recreation and  active transportation. On behalf  of my more than  2000 
patients, I urge  you  to  vote  yes on LD  209
