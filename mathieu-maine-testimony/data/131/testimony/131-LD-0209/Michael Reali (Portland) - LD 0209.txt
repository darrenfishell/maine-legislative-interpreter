LD 209
The LD 209 bill is just what the Maine biking community needs, a safe venue to 
enjoy our favorite pass time, biking! It will be great for runners and walkers as well. I 
live in Portland and ride my bike every day that the weather permits and I start and 
finish on the East End walking path along the water. If you question if the people of 
Maine will use this new trail system you should walk along the East End trail and see 
the use it gets for yourself, it is a true gem for the city and its visitors. Not only would
this create more recreational opportunities for all it would dramatically increase the 
safety of those who use our roads....which are so car focused that drivers don't even 
see cyclists.  I have personally come so close to disaster due to aggressive and 
inattentive drivers who think runners, walkers and cyclists don't have a right to use 
the same roads. Please support this bill which will enhance outdoor recreation and 
improve road safety for all.
