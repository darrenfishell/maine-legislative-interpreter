Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Eliza Cress and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community and in our state would be an incredible 
resource for me, and the residents and visitors of Maine.
It would be a tremendous recreational amenity and would provide invaluable 
connectivity through southern Maine providing a truly safe space for non-vehicular 
active transportation and travel. 
I am fortunate enough to live just blocks from Back Cove and have the pleasure of 
witnessing the overwhelming use of the multi-use trail in the city. I know the passage 
of LD-209 would provide that same opportunity for Maine residents and visitors in 
communities along the rail corridor improving connectivity, access to the outdoors, a 
safe recreational space, and ultimately public health. 
Thank you so much for your support of this bill! 
Sincerely, 
Eliza Cress
