To Whom it May Concern:
I provided spoken testimony yesterday during the Hearing.  Having the chance to 
listen to both sides for 4 full hours I have 2 suggestions:
1) The primary objection the Cons (Against) voiced against "Trails for Intrum Use 
then Rails" was that once the tracks were removed from the Line to install the Trail it 
becomes too difficult to replace them in the future.  Solution: figure out how to install 
the new Trail without removing the old RR track.
2) How long should one wait until unused RR Lines are considered not worth 
keeping?  Could someone come up with some reasonable Criteria to assess that the 
RR Line is or is not worth keeping?
Repectfully,
Ron Graham
