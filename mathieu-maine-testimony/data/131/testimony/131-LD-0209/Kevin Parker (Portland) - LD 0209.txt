I'm strongly in favor of the proposed legislation to implement a rail trail along this 
corridor, for both the recreational and outdoor opportunities it will provide for my 
family and community, and also the ability for us to travel around our region in a 
climate-friendly way.
We've already seen the benefit of this in Scarborough, Saco, and beyond with the 
Eastern Trailâ€”and we spend most weekends using the trail to access those 
communities. This would be an incredible resource for connectivity to the towns and 
cities north of Portland in the same way.
