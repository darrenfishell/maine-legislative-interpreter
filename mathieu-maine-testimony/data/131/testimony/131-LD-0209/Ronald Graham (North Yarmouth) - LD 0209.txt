My name is Ronald Graham. My family and l have lived in North Yarmouth for more 
than 25 years. 
The RR Line from Portland to Auburn crosses our road and is near our house. 
l support the compromise to convert the RR Line to a Trail with the reserve to convert it 
back to an active RR Line in the future, if that conversion provides clear and necessary 
social beneﬁt to the towns of Cumberland County. 
Please allow me to share some observations of a person that crosses and observes the 
RR Line daily: 
It has been more than 20 years since l have seen an actual train on the RR Line. 
It has been more than 10 years since l have seen a maintenance vehicle on the tracks. 
I have walked the RR Line more than a hundred times in both directions over the last3 
years. 
l walked it daily during the Covid Pandemic. 
Most days I have seen two or more other people also walking the RR Line when l was 
out walking. 
The RR Line leads directly to several Yarmouth and North Yarmouth Recreational Parks 
that are frequently used by families from this area. 
Trains can’t run safely on the existing track in the condition that it is in without major 
repairs to the RR Line first. 
If this conversion were completed, I and many other residents could ride bikes safely to 
downtown Yarmouth, downtown Portland, and Auburn without the danger of motor 
vehicles sharing the same road. l am sure that the number of bikers and walkers would 
increase dramatically once completed. 
l support LD 209. l strongly suggest that the RR Line is converted to a Trail that is 
accessible to the Public and not remain an unused RR Line as it has been for the last 
two decades. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Ronald Graham
