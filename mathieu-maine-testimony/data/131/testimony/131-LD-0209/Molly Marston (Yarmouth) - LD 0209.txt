Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Molly Marston and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
I find there is a lack of safe biking trail access to allow families to ride without the 
danger of car traffic. I would use the trail at least every other day if available.
Thank you.
