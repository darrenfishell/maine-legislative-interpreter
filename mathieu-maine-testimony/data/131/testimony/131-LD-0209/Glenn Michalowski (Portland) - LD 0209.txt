LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Glenn Michalowski and I am a resident of 288 State Street, Portland, 
Maine 04101. I am writing to express my steadfast support for Representative Bell's 
proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of 
Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use
Advisory Council.”
The addition of this rail trail in my community would be an invaluable asset, not just 
for me, but also for my family and the wider community. As an avid recreational 
cyclist, I would frequently utilize this trail, both for personal enjoyment and as a safe, 
alternative mode of transportation. Over the years, I've come to appreciate the 
significance of such routes in facilitating a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.
With my family, I anticipate using the trail several times a week, incorporating it into 
our daily routines whether for a leisurely bike ride, a safe and scenic route for 
commuting, or even a brisk walk to stay active. 
Beyond the immediate benefits to individuals and families, this rail trail presents an 
opportunity for wider societal advantages. The enhancement of our community's bike 
infrastructure promotes a shift towards more sustainable transport options, reducing 
traffic congestion and contributing to environmental conservation efforts.
Moreover, rail trails often prove to be significant catalysts for local economic growth. 
They attract visitors who spend in local businesses, contribute to the rise in property 
values along the trail, and can even stimulate job creation in sectors such as tourism 
and recreation. These benefits extend beyond the borders of our community, having a 
positive impact on our state's economy.
In conclusion, the rail trail as proposed in Rep. Bell's amendment to LD 209 is more 
than just a path – it is an investment in our community's future, promoting healthier 
lifestyles, fostering community spirit, and driving economic growth. I urge you to 
consider the manifold benefits of this initiative and lend your support to this 
amendment.
Thank you for your time and consideration
