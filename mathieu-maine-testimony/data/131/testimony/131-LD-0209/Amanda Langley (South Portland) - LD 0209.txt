Amanda Langley
South Portland
LD 209
Good evening,
My name is Amanda Langley and I am a resident of South Portland. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community. I have a Master in Public Health background, and 
know all the evidence that access to safe outdoor recreation makes happier, healthier 
communities.  It also encourage Mainers to increase physical activity in a low-barrier 
way that can help them thrive.
Thank you for your time and attention!
-Amanda
