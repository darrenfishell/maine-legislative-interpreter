LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Caitlin Patterson and I am a resident of Portland, and a 2x Olympian in 
cross-country skiing. I am writing to testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed 
amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to 
Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory 
Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my friends, and my community. Access to recreation and nature is crucial towards 
keeping all Maine residents and visitors healthy and appreciative of this beautiful 
state, and a rail trail would be an asset towards improving recreation accessibility. 
Thank you.
Caitlin Patterson
