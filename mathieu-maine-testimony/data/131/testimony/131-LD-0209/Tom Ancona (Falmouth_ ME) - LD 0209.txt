Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Tom Ancona and I am a resident of Falmouth. I am writing in to testify in
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through Falmouth would be an incredible resource for my 
community, my family, and the region as a whole. I spent over a decade in Chicago 
and the 15+ mile lakefront path there allowed me to commute without a car for many 
years. Many people used that trail, even year-round with winters that are harsher than 
here. This trail would provide greater climate-friendly connectivity with Portland and 
the surrounding communities and bring more business to Rt. 1 and the surrounding 
area while not adding to traffic in the same corridor. We live less than a mile from the
trial and we would use it weekly for family bike rides exploring the area with our 7- 
and 4-year-old children in ways that we cannot on our congested, dangerous streets. I 
would also invest in a new bike to commute to/from my job in Brunswick a few days 
per week if this trail was built and I did not need to take Rt. 1 or Rt. 88. 
I am glad that another rail line exists so that this transforming this line into a trail does
not restrict regional rail transportation when density and demand picks up for that as 
well. Thank you for considering this bill that will transform this desolate track into a 
beloved and well-used regional resource. 
Thank you,
Tom Ancona
