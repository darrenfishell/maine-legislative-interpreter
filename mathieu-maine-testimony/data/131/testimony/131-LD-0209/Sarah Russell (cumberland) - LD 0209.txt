Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Sarah Russell and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am writing to testify 
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for all.
A trail would provide many benefits - more exercise and outdoor access for people, 
more community interaction, a decrease in use of cars as transport, an increase in 
biking and walking by community members. It would also increase property values 
for the abutters. 
Trails for bikers, commuters, walkers is our future. 
Let Rep. Bell's Bill help us move Maine forward.
Thank you,
Sarah Russell
