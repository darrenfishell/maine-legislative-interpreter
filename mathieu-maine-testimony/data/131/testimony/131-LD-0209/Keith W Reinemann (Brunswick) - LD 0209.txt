Testimony in favor of LD 209  
 
As a resident of Brunswick, and an active cyclist, I strongly urge your support of LD 209, 
providing for the creation of an off-road rail trail for walkers, cyclists, and families.  A trail on 
this scale would establish the towns along the corridor as a destination for tourists and locals 
alike!   
 
A trail of significant length that connects through the beautiful pastoral landscape of Southern 
Maine can and should be celebrated as a win for health, community, public safety, 
transportation infrastructure, and the list goes on.  With the proper support from the 
Legislature, this trail could fuel economic growth in tourism, retail, restaurant/hospitality, while 
enhancing the quality of life for local Maine people.   
 
We have a toddler at home and love to get out with her on the bike.  Unfortunately, riding on 
the roads is just an unnecessary risk, and in many of the towns that the trail would link, riding 
on major roads just isnâ€™t possible, nor prudent. The off-road nature of this trail proposal means 
separating cars and bike riders, which is the safest for both and would cut down on accidents 
and risk, specifically in communities that are densely developed or lack quiet country lanes.  
 
This is a perfect use for the existing corridor, and does not preclude rail use in the future.  This 
is a win for Maine, a win for local small businesses & for our people.  I urge you to support this 
important legislation.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony.
