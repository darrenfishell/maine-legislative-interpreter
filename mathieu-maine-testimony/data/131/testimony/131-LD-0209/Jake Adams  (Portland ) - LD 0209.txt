Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Jake Adams and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
By providing a safe and relaxing space to ride bicycles the trail would allow us to 
enjoy the outdoors, get needed exercise, and spend time together away from the threat
of harm by automobile traffic.
We regularly ride bicycles in the Cumberland, Auburn, New Gloucester area and this 
trail would give us easier access and even provide and avenue for commuting to 
Auburn for work.
Thank you.
Jake Adams
