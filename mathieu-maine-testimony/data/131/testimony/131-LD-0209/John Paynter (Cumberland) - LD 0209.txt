I support the use of this rail corridor for a rail-trail but the railroad use must me 
maintained as well. This line would make an ideal commuter light rail line to serve 
the northern suburbs of Portland. A rail link to Auburn would be a great convenience 
for residents and tourists alike. The lure of a bike path through these towns would be 
excellent also.  Can we create a dual-use trail and rail line?
