Portland 
LD 209
I am a resident of Portland, Maine and am also a Physician Assistant, providing 
primary care to this community. I am a HUGE proponent of LD209, not only for 
myself and my family and friends, but for my patients. The use of this trail corridor 
will allow physical activity to help make the surrounding communities as healthy as 
possible. This has such positive implications beyond the enjoyment of the recreational
aspects. 
Thank you for considering my testimony!!
