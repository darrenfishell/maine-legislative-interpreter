All of them
LD 209
I OPPOSE LD 404, 209 & LD 1450. As a property owner and business owner that 
has this railroad track run besides my properties I have been a victim and so have my 
tenants to crime and vendalism. The City and area communities cannot control the 
issues they currently have with the homeless, drugs addicts and criminals now that are
overrunning their parks and the un-used tracks.  The rail corridor needs to stay and be 
used for rail transportation and growth for connecting our communities, not converted
into another bike and walking path. A path, that will be filled with individuals that 
will harm the area residents and business owners. As someone who has personally 
been a victim of these vagrants I urge you to drive around the City of Portland, down 
to the parks, down by the tracks and see for yourself what is happening.  Protect 
yourself, your family and your business and VOTE NO ON LD 209, LD 404, AND 
LD 1450!!
