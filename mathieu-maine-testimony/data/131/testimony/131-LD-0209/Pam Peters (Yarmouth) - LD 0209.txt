I live in Yarmouth on Riverfront Dr which has immediate access to the rail line 
through Yarmouth's Riverfront Woods Preserve.  I would love to be able to hop on 
my bike to ride into Portland or Auburn.  
What would be an immediate benefit for me and my neighborhood is a way to get into
town, towards the school, without having to cross East Elm St, very close to the 
intersection with a busy North Rd.  There are many children that ride from this side of
town that use the sidewalks and there is no crosswalk to get to them.
I walk my dogs twice a day which requires me to cross 4 times.  I am lucky to be 
pretty mobile and an active pedestrian for many years.  I feel this is one of the scariest
crossings that I have encountered.
Thank you for your attention,   Pam
