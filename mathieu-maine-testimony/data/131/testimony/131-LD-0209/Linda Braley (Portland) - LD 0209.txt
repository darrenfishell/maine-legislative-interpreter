Yes, these rail trails are fantastic. Maine has really fallen behind on this kind of 
infrastructure, even though so many of our rail corridors are not in use AND the 
chance of us being able to resurrect passenger train is VERY tiny--we don't have even
close to the population density required to support it, therefore federal funding will be
almost impossible to get.
I fully support the rail to trail.  I use the existing one from Scarborough south 
regularly.  I live in Portland and would love to have one going North.  The cars do not
like bicycle on the road even though we have every right to be there.  If there is a trail 
option, that would provide a safe option for people who do not feel comfortable on 
the road, and provide options for all riders, young and old.  What an amazing amenity 
this would be for the region, adding a fabulous quality of life to riding safely.  Being 
outside and enjoying our great state of Maine.
