North Yarmouth 
LD 209
LD 209 references unused rail bed that is parallel to an active rail line between 
Portland and Auburn, so we already have rail access between the cities. What we 
donâ€™t have are safe roads to walk or bicycle on and this trail would provide 26 miles 
of that access. We already have the fine example of the Eastern Trail to show us what 
this trail may become in the near future.
My husband and I live near n North Yarmouth and are avid cyclists and walkers and 
hope you support this trail to provide a safe way for families to enjoy all that this are 
has to offer.
Thank you.
