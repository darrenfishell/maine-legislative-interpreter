I support the development of a rail trail on the unused corridor connecting Portland, 
Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, North Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester, and 
Auburn. A extensive trail system that serves outlying towns in the greater Portland 
and Auburn area is not only needed, but would also support outdoor activity with 
minimal vehicle travel-reducing greenhouse gases is this critical stage of our climate. 
In many areas the trail would be within walking distance of  residences.  It would also
encourage more physical activity and support mental health. As a teacher who brings 
children to local outdoor spaces for learning-it would increase capacity for outdoor 
educational use amongst the eight towns and other nearby towns. Given the support 
from the public-volunteers would be available for ongoing upkeep once the system is 
in place. And, most importantly-this extensive trail would travel through the beautiful 
landscape of our amazing state and connect residents to the natural world. Fostering a 
love of nature is the most important step we can take to mitigating climate change and
protecting our local environments. Please do not let this opportunity escape us-let's 
work together for a unique rail trail for Maine!
