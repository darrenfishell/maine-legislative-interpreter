Support For  LD 209 Testimony
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Gail Witherill and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am writing in strong 
support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
As I am nearing my 7th decade, riding my bike on roads is becoming more 
challenging, with too many inattentive drivers and drivers who drive too fast.  Having
a near miss with a car was enough to make me realize I am safer if I look for area 
trails to ride on such as the Eastern Trail.  Having the Portland to Auburn  trail would 
be a godsend to folks like me who love to ride bikes but not at the expense of 
competing with inattentive drivers on the road.  Plus I know many people who search 
out such trails to ride when they are looking at vacationing in an area.  The trail would
be good for keeping healthy and good for Maine, the vacationland.  Please support 
LD 209.
Thank you.
