LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Rachelle, and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify in 
support of LD 209, which would allow the Department of Transportation to permit an 
interim bicycle and pedestrian trail on 26.5 miles of the inactive Berlin Subdivision 
Rail Corridor. 
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community. I believe the best use for these state-owned corridors 
is a trail. 
Thank you,
Rachelle
