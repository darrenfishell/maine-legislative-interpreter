Ian MacDonald
Yarmouth
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Ian MacDonald and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am strongly in favor 
of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of
Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use
Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource, please 
move this forward!
Thanks,
Ian
