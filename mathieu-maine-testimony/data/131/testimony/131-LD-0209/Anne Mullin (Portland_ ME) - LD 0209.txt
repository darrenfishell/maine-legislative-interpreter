Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Anne Mullin and I am a resident of Portland, ME. I am writing to 
strongly support Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me 
and my community.
I recently moved to Portland from Boston because I am a medical student at Tufts as 
part of the Maine Track program. Since moving here I've become involved with the 
biking community and have been highly impressed by the number of cyclists in the 
area, their passion for cycling, and the advocacy work surrounding bicycle safety 
here. The narrow roadways and shortage of bike lanes in the area make cycling here 
dangerous; having this rail trail as a safe connection between Portland and the 
surrounding communities would be an enormous asset to the community as a whole. 
I would ride on this rail trail many times per week and can imagine myself and my 
family utilizing it for decades to come. While I do live in Portland now, I can foresee 
my family living further from Portland in the future and would be delighted to 
commute into the city on the Casco Bay Trail for many years of my life. 
Thank you.
Anne Mullin
