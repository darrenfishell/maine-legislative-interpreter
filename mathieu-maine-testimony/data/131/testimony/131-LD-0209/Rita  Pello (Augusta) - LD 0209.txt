Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Rita Pello and I am a resident of Augusta. I am writing to testify in strong
support all the bills being heard today. I am in support of LD 209, which would allow 
the Department of Transportation to permit an interim bicycle and pedestrian trail on 
26.5 miles of the inactive Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor, while preserving the 
corridor for future rail.
I am also in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a 
trail & LD 1450 to help fund the building of the Mountain Division trail.
Having these rail trails through and near my community would be an incredible 
resource for me, my family, and my community. I believe the best use for these 
state-owned corridors is a trail and I support funding for trail systems such as these. 
Connected trails such as these will connect people to each other and to our natural 
places, providing a car-free alternative to get active outdoors and to get where we 
need to go.
We would use these trails often, walking our dogs, birding, and just in general 
spending quality time with friends and the community.
Trails provide recreation and experiences. It also provides economic opportunities for 
Maine towns. There's really no disadvantage to a trail system!
Thank you,
Rita Pello
