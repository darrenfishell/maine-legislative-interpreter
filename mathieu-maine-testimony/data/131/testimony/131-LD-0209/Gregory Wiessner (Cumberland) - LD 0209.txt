Senator
Chipman,
Representative
Williams,
and
Members
of
the
Transportation
Committee:
My
name
is
Greory
A.
Wiessner
and
I
am
a
resident
of
Cumberland,
ME.
I
am
speaking
to
you
to
testify
in
strong
support
of
Rep.
Bell’s
proposed
amendment
to
LD
209,
“Resolve,
to
Direct
the
Department
of
Transportation
to
Implement
the
Recommendation
of
the
Portland
to
Auburn
Rail
Use
Advisory
Council.”
In
support
of
LD
209,
I
submit
the
following
testimony:
●
Personal
Interest
○
My
family
of
four,
myself,
my
partner,
and
our
two
teenage
boys,
are
avid
bikers
and
and
walkers
and
would
like
to
increase
our
ability
to
safely
increase
the
use
of
our
bikes
for
transportation,
recreation,
shopping,
and
fitness
○
As
of
now,
the
ability
to
access
Portland,
Brunswick,
and
Lewiston/Auburn
safely
is
compromised
by
the
lack
of
appropriate
paths
○
We
enjoy
visiting
Portland
and
have
been
shopping
for
a
bike
capable
of
carrying
groceries
and
other
small
items
rather
than
use
our
car;
however,
that
purchase
has
been
postponed
due
to
the
lack
of
infrastructure
○
We
are
hoping
to
increase
the
use
of
a
bike
for
commerce
which
will
increase
our
health,
reduce
traffic,
and
cut
down
on
pollution;
however,
getting
to
the
grocery
store,
hardware
store,
etc.
is
currently
impossible
without
undue
risk
●
International
Experience
○
On
the
contrary,
when
we
visit
Quebec
City,
we
often
park
our
car
and
never
use
is
until
we
leave
because
of
the
plethora
of
bike
paths
within
and
outside
of
the
city;
we
shop,
go
to
dinner,
use
the
parks,
all
on
bike
○
In
Quebec
City,
people
of
all
ages
continue
to
bike
and
walk
because
of
the
safety
that
comes
with
dedicated
lines
○
Although
Maine
has
a
harsh
winter,
having
a
dedicated
bike
and
pedestrian
path
will
allow
safe
travel
nearly
year-round
○
Places
like
Paris
and
Finland
have
succeeded
in
creating
bike
paths;
instead,
we
have
a
fallow
train
line
does
not
see
any
use
but
could
instead
be
a
draw
for
economic
development,
tourism,
and
health.
For
ideas,
consider
viewing
the
following
(pardon
the
frustrated
snark
in
the
videos):

■
Finnish

●
Economic
and
Community
Benefits
○
The
interconnection
with
the
Eastern
Trail,
East
Coast
Greenway ,
and
locally
managed
trails
would
be
a
boon
to
developing
a
sustainable
tool
for
future
growth,
all
along
an
existing
right-of-way
○
Lastly,
because
bikes
are
necessarily
more
affordable
than
cars
to
purchase,
maintain,
and
have
a
significantly
less
impactful
burden
on
infrastructure,
a
functional
bike
trail
can
be
an
economic
boost
for
people
who
can’t
afford
a
car
or
for
whom
public
transit
is
not
convenient
(or
to
be
used
in
coordination
with
public
transit)
Thank
you.
