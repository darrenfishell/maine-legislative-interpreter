Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Lynda Bond and I am a resident of Saco, Maine.  I am writing to testify 
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through our Maine community would be an incredible resource 
for me, my family, Portland and surrounding areas, and the state of Maine.
I frequently visit Portland to be with my active grown children.  We love to be 
outdoors.  They live in East Deering.  Having this rail trail in Portland would increase 
our time outdoors enjoying their neighborhood.  We would walk and bike and cross 
country ski in the winter.  To enjoy the beauty of the outdoors so close to a thriving 
city would be remarkable.  
I am sure that I would use the trail at least twice weekly and very possibly more.
I love to develop our environment to its greatest potential.  Presently the space is 
sitting there and used intermittently by people in the area who want to explore.  Just 
think how many more people would be using this wonderful venue experiencing 
nature, the way life should be!  
Thank you.
Lynda Bond
