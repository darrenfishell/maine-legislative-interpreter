LD 209
As a parent and Falmouth resident, Iâ€™m writing in support of the rail trail. Many roads
in Southern Maine lack sufficient shoulders and sidewalks for safe biking and 
walking. Having access to a rail trail would enable my family and many like mine to 
safely commute by bike to / from Portland, and to adventure north safely. The 
otherwise unused train tracks are simply wasted space at present. I encourage the 
passage of LD 209.
