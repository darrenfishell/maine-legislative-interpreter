Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Tracy Teare and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am here to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community. We would use it for walking and biking both for 
transportation and health/fitness on a daily basis. It's an incredible opportunity to 
connect our community, get people out and improve their physical and mental health, 
and help reduce dependence on cars. When my husband and I were first married, we 
lived for two years on a bike path in Arlington, Mass. There was some push back 
before the trail went in. After it went in, there was incredible support and property 
values along the trail soared.  It was an invaluable resource, connecting people, 
connecting towns, and promoting wellness. Please support this important project. 
Thank you.
Tracy Teare
