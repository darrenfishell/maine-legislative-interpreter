Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation Committee: 
My name is Emma Bond and I am a resident of Portland. I am here to testify in strong support of 
Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the Department ofA 
Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory 
Council. ” 
This bill amendment would authorize an interim rail trail on the unused rail corridor connecting 
Portland to Auburn, along the Berlin Subdivision Route. This trail would be transformative for 
my community in Portland. Based on the study area from the recent Rail Use Advisory Council, 
the trail would connect the Eastern Prom to East Deering and the new Roux Institute campus, as 
well as connecting Portland to Auburn in a 26.5 mile active transportation thoroughfare. ‘ 
The Portland-to-Auburn interim trail is realistic, cost-effective, and would enable people to 
safely travel around the Portland area (and beyond) without a car. If approved for an interim trail 
use, MDOT has listed the Portland-to —Auburn trail as a ﬁrst priority among rail-trails, based on 
criteria such as accessing “jobs, educations, business, recreation, and other destinations ” and 
serving “ﬁrst- and last-mile connections to other transportation modes.”2 Once approved, the 
project could also apply for federal funding. Indeed, the Casco Bay Trail Alliance is currently 
being considered for a Congressional earmark for a related part of the trail network in F reeport. 
An interim trail is the best path forward for this corridor. Not only does it help solve the ﬁrst and 
last mile connections to other public transportation (including, as MDOT has prop0sed,3 a new 
bus service cormecting Portland and Lewiston), but it would not hinder the possibility of future 
passenger rail. As explained in the proposed bill amendment “ , any non-rail use would be 
“considered interim in nature, because all such rail corridors must be preserved for future rail use 
as provided in the State Rail Preservation Act.” Moreover, the proposed ’ route runs parallels to 
the CSX rail line, which already has active passenger rail from Portland to Yarmouth, and could 
continue passenger rail service to Lewiston in the future. 
MDOT has stated that it plans to proceed with a 2-year pilot commuter bus service between 
Portland and the Lewiston and Auburn area, which “is more ﬂexible [than passenger rail] in 
terms of deﬁning and revising workforce and equity needs” and “is climate friendly. ” 6 An 
interim trail would perfectly complement this enhanced public transportation option. 
Approving an interim trail would represent a critical step forward for active transportation in 
Maine. Please accept the proposed bill amendment and vote “ought to pass.”
