LD 209
My name is Jennifer Mahoney and I live in Falmouth, ME. I am writing in strong 
support for LD 209 and want the Department of Transportation to follow the 
recommendation of the Advisory council. Any way to give families access to the 
outdoors is a huge benefit to community wellness. We would use the trail for biking 
and walking. It is a tremendous opportunity to make Maine greener. Please support 
the Rail Trail.
