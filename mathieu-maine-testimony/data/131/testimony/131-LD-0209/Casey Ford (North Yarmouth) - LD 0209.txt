I am in favor of the rail trail on the unused corridor connec Ɵng Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, 
Yarmouth, North Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester, and Auburn.  As a bicycle shop owner in Yarmouth 
Maine, the trail would increase my current business and allow me to expand into the bicycle rental 
market.  As a bicycle rider it would provide me with a safe and quiet ride through the natural beauty of 
Maine. 
Rail trails oﬀer a unique riding experience in that they are mostly ﬂat with very moderate grades.  This 
allows riders, runners and walkers who may not feel safe on the highways or on rough terrain to enjoy 
the outdoors.  The boƩom line is, rail trails get used and are a wonderful addiƟon to the communiƟes 
they serve. 
Please vote to approve the rails to trails proposal. 
Sincerely, 
Casey Ford
