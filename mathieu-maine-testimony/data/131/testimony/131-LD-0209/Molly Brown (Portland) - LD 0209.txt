Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Molly Brown and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
My family currently uses numerous rail trails locally for fun and exercise throughout 
the area, and it would be so helpful to create a larger contiguous system with these 
longer-distance routes. 
Crucially, this rail trail system would provide off-road routes that keep its users 
protected from fast vehicle traffic. This means a safe place for parents pushing 
strollers, kids perfecting their pedal bike skills, and century cyclists alike.
Most importantly, as we work to create a more sustainable future with a diversity of 
transportation options, a trail that connects these locations could open up a new 
commuting option to so many people. This is good for the environment, 295 traffic, 
and the health of our communities.
Thank you,
Molly
