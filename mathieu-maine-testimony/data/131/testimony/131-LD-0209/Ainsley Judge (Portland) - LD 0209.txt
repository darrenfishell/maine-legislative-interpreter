Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Ainsley and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to testify in strong 
support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
This would provide a key alternative transportation and recreation connector here in 
Maine. It could be used for safe bike travel and commuting between small towns and 
communities as well as connecting two of our major cities. My family and I would 
personally use it to visit friends, farms, and camping in North Yarmouth and Pownal 
without using a car. It would be safe to travel on with children and provide a 
sustainable transportation alternative for my coworkers to travel into Portland for 
work from neighboring towns. This is a huge opportunity for the future of Maine. 
Thank you.
