I fully support the rail trail initiative.  A am an active cyclist and have lived in 
Cumberland for over 30 years. I enjoy cycling all around the area, but the roads are 
becoming busier and busier with car traffic. Having a trail network to connect 
Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester and Auburn 
will provide cyclists of all types an opportunity to get outside and ride safely, away 
from car traffic. I look forward to commuting to Portland on the trail network!!
