Sally (Sara is my legal name) Bancroft
LD 209
I am writing in support of the Amendment to LD209 which would allow a bike trail to
be built on the unused Portland to Auburn railroad, providing the crucial link for the 
Casco Bay Trail vision. Not only does it open up significant alternatives to adding 
exhaust fumes to our air, it also encourages folks to get out and exercise in a safe, 
no-traffic sharing way. My husband I would look forward to having this option and 
urge you to pass this amendment.
