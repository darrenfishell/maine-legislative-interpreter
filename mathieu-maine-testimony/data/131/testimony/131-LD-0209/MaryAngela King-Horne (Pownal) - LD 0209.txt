LD 209
This testimony is in support of LD 209, to follow through with the RUAC 
recommendation and make this unused rail corridor an interim trail. As a resident of 
Pownal, having a trail that connects to communities would be a great way to have 
active and an alternative mode of transportation in this area. The rural roads here have
turned into highways. Motor vehicles drive at high speeds, and the high volume 
dominates the roads. And most roads have no shoulders. It does not feel safe to walk 
or ride a bike to get to other destinations.  If there was an alternative way to get 
around such as this unused rail corridor, more people would walk or bike ride, which 
would benefit public and environmental health. This public resource should be used 
and made accessible. Please vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your service to the 
people of Maine.
