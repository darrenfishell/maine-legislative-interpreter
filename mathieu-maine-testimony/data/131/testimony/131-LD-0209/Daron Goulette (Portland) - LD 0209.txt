Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Daron C Goulette and I am a resident of Portland. I am writingto testify 
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
I would use this trail regularly to connect to downtown both for work and leisure 
which would significantly lessen parking problems and congestion in the Old Port.
Given the 295 congestion during commuting times this would help relieve traffic and 
carbon emissions for residents and the metro area while providing a safe trail for 
families to bike, walk, and exercise safely.
With all of the taxes currently imposed on residents burdening them daily, this is a 
project we can point to that shows where those tax dollars go that aligns with our life 
is good here motto.
Thank you,
Daron Goulette
