LD 209
Good morning,
My name is Gretchen Bergill and I live in Woolwich and work in Yarmouth.
I am writing in support of writing in support of LD 209, An Act to authorize a rail 
trail on the unused corridor connecting Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, 
North Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester, and Auburn.
As a long time cyclist, I have begun to lose courage riding on busy roads and have 
begun looking for more off road riding opportunities.  Cycling is a great form of 
exercise and a real community builder.  The work the Bicycle Coalition of Maine has 
done in towns like Bath, such as their silence ride last night - in honor of cyclists 
killed on public roads -  prove that people like biking (safely) and appreciate 
opportunities to connect with other cyclists. 
I believe an expansion of Maine's existing trail system is a great way to get more 
people out riding safely and a wonderful opportunity for families to get their children 
on bikes.
I hope that you will support use of this unused rail corridor for more safe cycling.
Respectfully,
Gretchen Bergill
Woolwich
