Falmouth 
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Adam Read and I am a resident of Falmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to 
Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
Our family bikes recreationally often during 3 seasons. We use the trail system for 
more technical mountain biking and the available trails in other parts of the state. We 
are excited to have a less technical trail with significant distance with much of it off 
of the main roadways. Drivers can be dangerous and road type biking is preferred 
where ever possible for us. 
I also work in an area that would be accessible via this trail and connecting trail 
systems. In areas where parking is difficult. I would welcome the opportunity to ride 
my bike to work for both the health and convenience benefits.
