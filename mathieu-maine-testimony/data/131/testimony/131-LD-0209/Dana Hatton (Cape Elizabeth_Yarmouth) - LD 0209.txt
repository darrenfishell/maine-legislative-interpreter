Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Dana Hatton and I am a resident of Cape Elizabeth. I am writing to testify
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through/near my community would be an incredible resource for 
me, my family, and my community.
This trail system would be such an amazing opportunity for me to be able bike, run, 
or ski, and to see my family and friends located in Greater Portland without the 
wasted time of sitting in traffic. I'm a very active person and having the ability to use 
a safe trail as a way to commute to work in Yarmouth and other places would be a 
game changer.
This trail would not only be faster commuting places due to no traffic, but it would be
a lot safer. There are so many bicycle vehicle accidents every year and this would 
reduce those accidents. I'd love to use this trail to help climate change. Let's put less 
cars on the road, and more people on the trails, commuting to work, seeing friends 
and families, and getting exercise. We all win.  
Thank you,
Dana
