Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee: 
My name is Patricia Pinto, and I am a resident of Portland. I am here to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell's proposed amendment of LD 209, "Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory CounciI." 
I am an Aging Well Activist and yes, a Boomer. I know I speak for a lot of older 
Mainers who live in these communities and along this corridor and cherish being 
outdoors. 
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for 
me, and my fellow older compadres â€” a group of interested l\/lainers who stand 
ready to become ambassadors of the Casco Bay Alliance trails. 
We plan to organize creative walks and talks that will help combat isolation and 
get residents out into nature. It is a fact that such physical activity contributes 
tremendously to leading healthy lives. 
Either individually or with others, it will allow us to experience local retreats, so to 
speak, only limited by our imaginations.
