Good afternoon, 
     I am testifying my concerns as a landowner who abuts the proposed rail trail. If I 
can be assured that as a homeowner on the trail that my privacy will be honored and 
maintained I can be a supporter of this trail; otherwise, I am not. There is definite 
concerns about sending traffic behind our homes. Our neighbors have small children 
and small animals that may stray into the trail. There needs to be a way to address this
issue. We live in the country because we value our privacy. Thank you hearing my 
testimony. Sincerely,  Michele Flaherty
