Greetings. Thank you for making the opportunity to allow me to speak regarding 
LD209, as l support the interim conversion to trail of the Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor. 
I am Harry Nelson and have been a resident of North Yarmouth, Maine for the past 44 
years. 
In 2007 a small tech company l work for moved out of a farm house in Edgecomb that 
our company’s founder owned, and we moved to a ‘real office‘ in Yarmouth. l love bike 
riding, and l’m happy to say that for at least 7 months of the year I commuted by bike 
down Route 115 to my office - a short 20 minute commute. 
Our company continued to grow, and in 2013 we moved to a much larger office in 
Scarborough. My 6 mile commute turned into 22 miles, and while I have to admit that 
the frequency of my bike commuting diminished substantially, I still tried to keep it upa 
couple of times a week. 
Riding a bike to work is mentally, physically, ethically, and environmentally the best way 
to commute. And it is most wonderful way to start and end the work day. 
My ride to Scarborough included portions of the Eastern Trail in South Portland and 
Scarborough — a ‘somewhat ’ urban trail — making it so much more pleasurable for me 
than riding on the roads. But on September 26, 2016 my bike commuting days came to 
abrupt end, as I was hit by a pick up truck on Highland Avenue in Scarborough. Some 
of you may know that the Eastern Trail - a repurposed rail line - is not contiguous and 
relies on state roads, Highland Avenue being one of them. l suffered a concussion, 
amnesia, and a broken back. And l gave up commuting by bike, and my love for 
cycling. 
Hundreds of commuters will use the trail every day to get from Yarmouth to Portland, 
and perhaps from farther towns. This is an opportunity to create a safe, flat and secure 
multipurpose pedestrian trail that we must embrace and make happen. 
Thank you.
