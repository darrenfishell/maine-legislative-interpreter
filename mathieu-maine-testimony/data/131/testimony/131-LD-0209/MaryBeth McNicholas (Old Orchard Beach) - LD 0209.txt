Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is MaryBeth McNicholas and I am a resident of Old Orchard Beach. I am 
writing to testify in strong support all the bills being heard today. I am in support of 
LD 209, which would allow the Department of Transportation to permit an interim 
bicycle and pedestrian trail on 26.5 miles of the inactive Berlin Subdivision Rail 
Corridor, while preserving the corridor for future rail. 
I am also in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a 
trail & LD 1450 to help fund the building of the Mountain Division trail.
Having these rail trails through and near my community would be an incredible 
resource for me, my family, and my community. I believe the best use for these 
state-owned corridors is a trail and I support funding for trail systems such as these. 
Connected trails such as these will connect people to each other and to our natural 
places, providing a car-free alternative to get active outdoors and to get where we 
need to go.
I am an avid cyclist and appreciate the beauty and safety of off-road cycling. I 
frequently travel to trails at least once a week, especially in the summer when traffic 
is dense in OOB.  I look forward to safely and leisurely enjoying this 26 miles of 
scenery and exploring restaurants, shops, and watering holes from Portland to 
Auburn, and sharing the experience with friends and family from Maine and beyond.
Thank you,
MaryBeth McNicholas
