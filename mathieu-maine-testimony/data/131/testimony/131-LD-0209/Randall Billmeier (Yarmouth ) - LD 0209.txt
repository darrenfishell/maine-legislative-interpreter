Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Randall Billmeier and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify
in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct 
the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland 
to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
We would hike and bike the trail on a regular basis and meet up with others to do the 
same. This would help bring our communities together. 
Thank you.
Randy Billmeier
