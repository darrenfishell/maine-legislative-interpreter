LD 209
Dear Transportation Committee,
I am a resident of Falmouth and am writing today in support of LD 209, which would 
authorize a rail trail on the unused corridor connecting Portland, Falmouth, 
Cumberland, Yarmouth, North Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester, and Auburn. 
This is the anchor of the Casco Bay Trail vision.   
I fully support the vision for a rail trail for the following reasons:
1) The trail will provide a safe place for outdoor recreation.  I bike on public roads, 
but have had many near misses with vehicular traffic.  I would appreciate the 
opportunity to bike on a less trafficked corridor.
2) The rail trail promotes health and wellness for a wide variety of ages.  People can 
use the trail for biking walking, running, and dog walking.
3) The rail trail connects communities, helping us build relationships and connections 
among nearby towns.  By connecting Portland with more rural communities, it offers 
residents of any income level the opportunity to enjoy a free public resource.  
4) The rail trail offers people the opportunity to put down their devices, step away 
from work, and get out in nature, absorbing the well-documented benefits to mental 
health.  
Thank you for your consideration and for supporting LD 209.
