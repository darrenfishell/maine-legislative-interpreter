Yarmouth
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Anna Siegel and I am a resident of Yarmouth. I am writing to testify in 
strong support of my legislator Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, 
“Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
As a birder and hiker, trails are essential for my outdoor hobbies. I would use a trail 
such as the one created through this bill weekly on birdwalks, to bike between 
communities, and hang out with friends. 
As a young person, trails are essential for my movement since I have limited access to
a car. Walkable and bikeable communities are necessary for individuals who cannot, 
or would prefer not, to drive. 
Trails get people outdoors and exercise, provide opportunities to travel without cars, 
and connect Mainers to the natural world around them.
Thank you,
Anna Siegel
