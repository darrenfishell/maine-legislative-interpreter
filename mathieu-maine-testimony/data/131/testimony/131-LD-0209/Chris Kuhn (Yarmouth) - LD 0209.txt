LD 209
I am writing in support of LD 209, 404, and 1450. Converting the dormant rail line to 
an active transportation corridor connecting Portland with Lewiston Augusta would 
be transformational for the communities served by this trail. The trail will serve as an 
economic stimulus in addition to being fun and improving the health of those able to 
enjoy it. This corridor has been studied repeatedly for conversion from rail to trail and
repeatedly been shown to be an ideal use of land. I strongly support this conversion 
and encourage funding be allocated to begin its construction as soon as possible.
