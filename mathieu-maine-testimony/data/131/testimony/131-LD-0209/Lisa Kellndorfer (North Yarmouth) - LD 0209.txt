Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Lisa Kellndorfer and I am a resident of North Yarmouth. I am writing to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
My family would use the trail for recreation and for bike commuting. Our home's 
proximity to the trail means we would use it almost every day. It will add so much 
value to our community by providing additional recreational space. In addition, it has 
the potential to reduce car traffic in the summer as it would provide a safe path for 
bike commuting and travel. This trail would also provide a great opportunity for the 
local businesses near the trail because of the increase in accessibility and number of 
visitors. 
Thank you.
Lisa Kellndorfer
