Aaron Hamlen
Cumberland
LD 209
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Aaron Hamlen and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am [here/writing] to 
testify in strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the 
Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council.”
Having this rail trail through my community would be an incredible resource for me, 
my family, and my community.
