Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation Committee: 
My name is Christopher Bond and I am a resident of Cape Elizabeth. I am here to testify in 
strong support of Rep. Bell’s proposed amendment to LD 209, “Resolve, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail 
Use Advisory Council. ” 
Having this rail trail between Portland and Auburn would be an incredible resource for me, my 
family, and my community. 
My wife and I use rail corridors frequently for walking and bicycle riding. I am convinced thatI 
am a healthier and happier person as a direct result of the safe outdoor exercise opportunities that 
come from our community ’s investment in former rail trails here in the greater Portland area and 
throughout Maine. When I am using trails, I also see firsthand the family and community 
building beneﬁts that others enjoy while walking and riding repurposed abandoned train track 
corridors. For what We receive, this investment in safe outdoor activities is invaluable to me and 
my family and thousands of others throughout our state. Accordingly, I strongly urge the 
Transportation Committee to recommend passage of LD 209. 
Thank you. 
Christopher nd
