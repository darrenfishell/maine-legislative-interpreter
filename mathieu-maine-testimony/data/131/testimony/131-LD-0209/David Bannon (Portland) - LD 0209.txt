LD 209
dear Sir/Madam, Relative to the above matter concerning LD 209, I am a resident of 
Portland Maine and strongly support the measure to approve and authorize a rail trail 
on the unused corridor connecting Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, North
Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester, and Auburn. This measure is consistent with the 
essential utilization of active and healthy initiatives as well optimal utilization of 
available land for use by the public.
