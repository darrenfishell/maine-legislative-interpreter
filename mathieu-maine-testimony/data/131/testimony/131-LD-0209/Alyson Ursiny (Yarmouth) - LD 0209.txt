Dear Casco Bay Trail Alliance,
I am writing this testimony to express my strong support for the extension of the rail 
trail to connect the towns north of Portland. As an avid runner and a parent, I believe 
that this expansion will provide immense benefits to both individuals and 
communities, fostering safety, convenience, and healthier lifestyles for all.
First and foremost, as a competitive runner, finding safe training routes free from 
vehicular traffic is of utmost importance to me. The proposed extension of the rail 
trail would offer a dedicated space for runners like myself to pursue our passion 
without constantly worrying about sharing the road with cars. The removal of this 
concern would not only enhance our running experience but also significantly 
contribute to our overall safety and peace of mind.
Furthermore, as a parent, I am always seeking opportunities to engage in outdoor 
activities with my children while ensuring their safety. The extension of the rail trail 
would provide an ideal space for families like mine to enjoy biking together, free 
from the hazards posed by heavy traffic. By creating a separate and secure path for 
cyclists, we can foster a sense of adventure, exercise, and togetherness in our children 
while minimizing risks associated with vehicle interactions.
In addition to the personal benefits, extending the rail trail would have a positive 
impact on our environment and the broader community. My husband currently 
commutes to Portland for work, and the prospect of being able to bike from Yarmouth
would greatly reduce our family's reliance on gas and contribute to a greener 
transportation system. Encouraging alternative modes of commuting, such as cycling, 
aligns with our shared commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and improving 
air quality in our region.
Moreover, connecting the towns north of Portland through the rail trail extension 
would make these communities more accessible to all residents. This enhanced 
connectivity would foster social interaction, promote local businesses, and stimulate 
economic growth in these areas. It would encourage residents from different towns to 
explore new areas, build relationships, and create a stronger sense of community 
among neighboring towns.
Lastly, the rail trail extension would have a profound impact on the overall health and
well-being of the Maine population. By providing a safe and convenient space for 
outdoor activities, such as walking, running, and cycling, it would encourage people 
of all ages and fitness levels to engage in regular exercise. Research has consistently 
shown that physical activity is crucial for maintaining good health, preventing chronic
diseases, and improving mental well-being. The extension of the rail trail would serve
as a catalyst for a healthier and happier population.
In conclusion, I strongly support the extension of the rail trail to connect the towns 
north of Portland. As a competitive runner, a parent, and an advocate for sustainable 
living, I am confident that this expansion would greatly benefit individuals, families, 
and the entire community. It would provide a safe training ground for runners, a 
secure space for families to enjoy outdoor activities, and an environmentally friendly 
commuting option for workers. Moreover, it would enhance accessibility, foster 
community connections, and improve the overall health of the Maine population.
Thank you for considering my testimony and for your ongoing efforts to promote 
active transportation and a vibrant community.
Sincerely,
Alyson Ursiny
