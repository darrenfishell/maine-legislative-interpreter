LD 209
This testimony is listed under LD 209, but it applies to the two other bills under 
review as well.
Increasing the amount of long distance rail trails within the state is important to me 
for several reasons. First, as a Mainer who is raising a family to be active in the 
outdoors, having corridors like this to ride bikes for long distances without having to 
worry about drivers in cars (who are faster and more distracted with each passing 
year) opens up so many possibilities for safe recreation and traffic-free travel. These 
trails will allow families from across a broad swath of the state to ride safely, and pass
on a love of biking and the outdoors to a new generation.
Secondly, I have done several long distance bike tours around the northeast US, and 
try to ride as many miles on rail trails and other multi-use paths as I can. I can say that
every other state in the region has more miles of non-motorized rail trails than Maine, 
and it makes me favor those states when planning a tour. I am sure that is the case for 
many bicycle tourists; opening up and promoting these corridors will encourage 
cyclists from far and wide to come ride in Maine, and drive that sector of our vital 
tourism industry. 
Lastly, as we struggle with the challenges of increasing motor vehicle traffic 
congestion in greater Portland and Southern Maine as a whole, especially during the 
busy summer months, opening up these corridors as a viable means of commuting is 
an important method of reducing the amount of cars on our roads. I firmly believe that
all of these lines, but particularly the Berlin Subdivision, would become widely used 
by people commuting to and from Portland for work, errands, school, and more. With 
the State's stated commitment to sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, this is a no-brainer. 
Thank you for reading my testimony, have a great day up there.
