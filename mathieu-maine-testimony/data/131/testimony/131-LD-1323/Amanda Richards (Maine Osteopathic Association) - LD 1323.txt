Testimony of the  Maine O steopathic Association  
Before the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services  
 
In Reference to:  
LD 1323 , An Act to Amend the Opioid Education Requirements  
Public Hearing: Thursday, April 13, 2023 1:00 PM,Cross Building, Room 220  
 
Senator  Bailey, Representative  Perry and distingu ished members of the Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services , 
 
The Maine Ost eopathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization representing appro ximately 40 0 
osteopathic physicians as well as more t han 700 residents and students. Our missio n is to “ serve the Osteopathic 
profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated  effort of professional education, advocacy and member 
services in order to ensure the availability of quality oste opathic health  care to the people of  this State.”  
 
The MOA is pleased  to provide comments in reference to LD 1323. We have had dialogue regarding this bill with 
our colleagues at the Maine M edical Association,  and we echo  their request  to the committee and the  legisla ture 
to not only amend LD 1323 by striking  all sections of the bill but go further and repeal all the listed sections .  
 
Our reasons are  well reflected in the  materials th ey plan to present, so we will not belabor them here .  However, 
we would like  to highlight a few key points from  our p erspective:  
 
Education an d lifelong learning are at the core of the MOA ’s mission. As a CME sponsor of AOA Category  1 
CME, we provide 40+ continuing medical education  credits  (CMEs)  for physicians  in the s tate and nationwide  
every yea r in a variety of accessible formats (online, in person, etc.)  These programs are advertis ed on our website 
www.mainedo.org  and online programs are available through a website we collabo rate on with  many other 
organizations  across the country called thecmecenter.org . 
 
We are committed t o helping our members and other healthcare professionals  keep up with the  latest 
developments in their field and  improve their clinical skills, medical decision making and patient care overall. As 
such, we provide a variety of topics based upon the needs of our a udience and the latest research and clinical 
practice guid elines. Since the 2016 law passed creating the Opioid Prescribing  CME requirement s, we have 
consistently provided these credits in our educational offer ings – this amoun ts to dozens of credit hour s on opioid 
prescribing speci fically provided  over time . And through our onlin e CME website there are currently  40+ separate 
program s available regarding Opioid medications  for our members. These are in addition to the many o ther state 
level programs provided by organizations  such as the  Maine SUD Learning Community  and other s that  we 
frequently  advertise to our members, many of  which are free.  
 
We echo our colleagues ’ assertion that Main e physicians  who have maintained licensure since 2017  have more 
than satisfied  the new DEA requirement  (a one -time training requirement of 8.0 hour s on the treatment and 
management of patients with opioid or other substance use  disorders ). And the MOA , as a qualified provider  of 
this education , is committed to providing it on an ongoing basis  as needed.   
 
Physicians and other healthcare practitioners have continuing education requirements to ensure that they are kept 
up to date with the  medical knowledge and practice guidelines that help them provide the best possible patient 

 2 care. Th is knowledge evolves over time and as such we believe its approp riate to evolve with it.  Maine has 
appropriate guideposts in p lace to ensure that physicians are completing  an adequate number of CMEs and allow 
them to choo se those that pertain to their particular  practice of medicine . And we know th at they have access to 
quality continuing education , especially on prescribing in particular and so we see no need to continue to dictate 
another  now redundant  requirement.  
 
We urge the committee to vote Ought to Pass as Amend ed.
