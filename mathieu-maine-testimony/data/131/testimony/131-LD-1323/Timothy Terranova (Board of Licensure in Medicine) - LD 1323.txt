Re:  LD 1323  – “An Act to Amend the Opioid Education Requirements”  
Dear Senator Bailey and Representative Perry: 
The Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine (“BOLIM”) licenses and regulates allopathic physicians and physician 
assistants in Maine. BOLIM is composed of 11 members: 6 physicians who actively practice medicine; 2 physician 
assistants who actively render medical services; and 3 public members. BOLIM’s mission is to protect the public 
by ensuring its licensees are ethical, professional and competent. It fulfills this mission by licensing, regulating, and 
educating physician and physician assistants. 
In 2015 the Maine Legislature enacted the current 3-hour continuing medical education (CME) requirement 
regarding opioid prescribing as a condition for physicians and physician assistants to prescribe opioids in response 
to the ballooning opioid epidemic and rising opioid overdose deaths. Currently, the law requires 3 hours of CME 
every 2 years (which coincides with re-licensure every 2 years) for physicians and physician assistants.   
This bill would reduce the number of hours of CME regarding the prescription of opioid medication a health care 
provider who prescribes opioid medication must complete every two years from 3 hours 1 hour and directs BOLIM 
to adopt rules implementing the requirement. 
BOLIM offers the following comments neither in support of nor against LD 1323: 
1. The opioid epidemic is still in full force with continually rising overdose deaths. 
2. BOLIM contracts with an entity to provide free online CME for its licensees (and any other types of 
licensees) to meet this CME requirement.  
3. BOLIM requires only 40 hours of CME every 2 years for renewal of physician licensure – and the 3 hours 
of opioid CME currently required can be applied towards that total (i.e. it’s not in addition to it). This also 
applies to physician assistants, though their CME requirements are higher.  
4. BOLIM continues to receive and initiate complaints against its licensees based upon opioid prescribing.  In 
fact, recently BOLIM received 10 referrals from the Prescription Monitoring Program regarding physicians 
with alleged problematic opioid prescribing – including excessive dosages and co-prescribing other 
controlled drugs.

5. BOLIM would have to amend 3 rules if LD 1323 passes to reduce the opioid CME requirement from 3 
hours to 1 hour:  
a. Chapter 1 - Rule Regarding Physicians;  
b. Chapter  2 – Joint Rule Regarding Physician Assistants (with the Board of Osteopathic Licensure); 
and  
c. Chapter 21 – Use of Controlled Substances for Treatment of Pain (a joint rule with the Board of 
Osteopathic Licensure, the Board of Nursing, and the Board of Licensure of Podiatric Medicine). 
 
In sum, the current 3-hour CME requirement regarding opioid prescribing is not onerous and is available for free. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments regarding LD 1323.  
Sincerely, 
 
Timothy Terranova 
Assistant Executive Director
