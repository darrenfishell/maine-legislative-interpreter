While we standiin opposition today, weremain willing to engage in discussions with the bill 
,_ sponsor and the Town of Turner. MaineDOT has scheduled several meetings with the Town and ' 
bill sponsor to meet and discusstheir request of p‘ostp;oning the signalproject at the intersection 
of Routes 4. and; 117. Each meeting we have scheduled has unfortunatelyhad to be rescheduled 
due to inclement weather. We are in the process of scheduling j-another meeting which we hope 
will occur on,I\/larch 24. Our» intent is to meet with the town, listen to their concerns regarding- 
this traffic signal project and see if a compromise canbe reached. -

LD .729 is an attempt to circumvent MaineDOT ’s ‘work plan process, something we historically 
oppose. "The bill directs MaineDOT to postpone theinstallation of atrafﬁc signal at the 
intersection of Routes 4 and 117 in‘ the Town of Turner, and instead install _a signal atthe’O 
intersection of Route 4iand Weston Road. . 
It then directs the department ton conu duct a study to_ 
determine if a trafﬁc’ signal is needed at the postponed location of Rout_es_ ‘4 and 117,. 1' 
MaineDOT ’s current work plan includes three programmed intersection projects along Route4 
T 
within the Town of Tumer. The two intersections referenced in this bill are two of those three" 
projects and_h _ave been designatedi as high crash locations for multiple consecutive three-year

The Route 44/Route 117 intersection was ﬁrst added §to'MaineDOT ’s work plan in 2021 and is 
scheduled to beadvertised for construction this fall." The Route_4/Weston Road intersection 
" 
project is currently scheduled to advertise in 2025; These two intersections are approximately _ 
one mile‘ apart fromione another. Thank you for your.tirne' andI would be happy to try and- 
address any questions you might have or bring additional informationtjo the work session- -
