LD 1234
I would like you to please support LD1234. K-9 officers perform so many important 
tasks during their working lives, sometimes putting their lives in danger. These brave 
and hard-working officers deserve our thanks, and we can offer it in the form of vet 
care reimbursements to their handlers.
