 
 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association   
 
Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1386 , An Act to Require That a Completed Form for the Homestead Property Tax 
Exemption Be Provided to a Person Purchasing a Home  
 
April 1 3, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony neither for nor against LD 1 386 on behalf of 
the 70 municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Associa tion’s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal 
interest.   
Municipal officials support the general intent  of the bill that would make new 
homeowners  aware of the Homestead Exemption program .  However , they are concerned with 
the unintended consequences  should the seller’s representative fail to explain nuances of the 
program, in particular the requirement that the owner have owned a home in Maine for 12 
months and the April 1 application deadline , as standards of eligibility .  The fear is that the 
municipal assessor or frontline employee would be left to explain why the provision of the 
exemption was delayed.   A more palatable solution would  be to require the seller’s 
representative to inst ead provide a copy of the application to the new homeowner and encourage 
them to meet with the municipal assessor .   
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about our position, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 1-800-452-8786.
