 131st Maine Legislature  
Committee on Taxation  
 
Re:  OPPOSITION to LD 1386  Dear Members of the Taxation Committee:  
  I have only just become aware of LD 1386 and I regret that I was not able to testify in 
person and compile a more comprehensive response.  I also regret that more settlement agents 
did not become more timely aware of this additional obligation to be added to our duties.    I have been a Maine lawyer for 23 years, and have been practicing real estate and title 
law exclusively for 17 years .  I have personally conducted over 3,000 real estate closings and my 
law firm presently employs three real estate closing coordinators, who are responsible for gathering the necessary information to prepare and assemble the documents comprising the “closing package” that has to be executed by the buyers, sellers, closing agent, realtors, and lenders before, during, and after the closing. In this role, my law firm, like title companies, 
serves as Settlement Agent, and we are a registered Maine Real Estate Sett lement Agency, 
registration #RSA49.   Over the years, the closing package has grown, oftentimes consisting of 100 pages or 
more and sometimes requiring a borrower/buyer to sign and initial in as many as 75 places.  A continual stream of new mandates continues to add more and more documentation to the package to comply with municipal, county, state, and federal law and regulations.  Often, in evaluation of whether to require yet one more form, the cumulative size and complexity of the closing package is not taken into consideration.  
  While I support the goal of spreading awareness of the availability of the homestead 
property tax exemption, I oppose obligating settlement agents to be the channel for that effort.  Therefore, I write to oppose LD 1386, for the following reasons, ranging from technical and legal to practical.  
 1) The bill’s proposed trigger for application is the definition of “residential real property” in 33 MRSA §171(6) .  This definition is too broad a category of real estate because it is not limited to 
homestead properties as defined by 36 MRSA §681(2).  Further, it is not limited to properties that have been owned by the applicant for the preceding 12 months – somethi ng which cannot be 
true at the closing of a real estate purchase, of course.  
 2) In rela tion to #1 above, by law a person is not entitled to apply for the homestead property tax 
exemption until they have owned a homestead for a period of 12 months.  Consider the attached  
Homestead Property Tax Exemption Application promulgated by “the bureau” as required by 36 MRSA §684(1).  Note that Section 1 requires the “Homestead Owner” to affirmatively check all three boxes under 1(a), (b), and (c).  Note further that  at the end of the form, the Homestead 
Owner is required to declare under penalty of perjury that all the foregoing facts and assertions are true, and the form warns  that falsely filing information to obtain the exemption is additionally 
a Class E crime.

Filling out such a form at closing, it is impossible to truthfully swear that the applicant has owned the homestead for the preceding 12 months.  Therefore, the applicant would be committing a crime and perjury to say so, and the settlement agent would be facilitating the commission of a crime and perjury  to prepare the form, solicit a signature, and mail the form in 
to the local tax assessor.  
 Note that there are rumors of many local assessors allowing applicants to “pre -submit” the 
application, to remain on file until the next assessment date arrives, when the facts asserted therein have presumably ripened into truth.  Of course, at the time of closing, the buyer(s) may intend to use the property as their homestead for the upcoming 12 months, but for infinite possible reasons they may not actually do so.  S ettlement agents, being required to comply 
precisely with all applicable laws affecting the closing, cannot be participants in the execution and submittal of documents we know to be false when executed.  
 3) Settlement services in Maine are performed largely on a flat fee basis, with a typical “closing fee” or “settlement fee” from a law firm or title company ranging from $300 to $450.   The more 
information gathering, form filling, and mailing that settleme nt agents are required to do, the 
more pressure builds on them to raise fees to cover the increase in personnel time, software updates, and postage costs necessary to accomplish these requirements.  
 4) Participants in real estate closings already suffer fr om document fatigue.  The thickness of the 
closing package is constantly fodder for jokes amongst participants in good humor, and a source of irritation, and occasionally anguish, for people who are unhappy about the transaction or afflicted by a disabilit y that makes it hard for them to sign paperwork or participate in a lengthy 
meeting.   In my practice, I strive to reduce the number of necessary documents or combine 
documents to reduce the number of signatures – both to foster customer satisfaction and to reduce customer confusion.  I oppose, on a document -by-document basis if I must, the addition 
of still more documentation to the residential closing package.  
 5) Presently, in any residential real estate transaction in which the property taxes for the cur rent 
year are paid, the settlement agent closes the transaction and has no obligation to send any mailings or transmissions to the municipality at all.  The Real Estate Transfer Tax Declaration is submitted electronically to the State of Maine.  After the recording of the deed at the Registry of Deeds, that information flows to the various municipal assessors.  Passage of this bill will add not just an additional form, but an additional mailing requirement to settlement agents’  lengthy 
list of obligations.  
 6) If any notification or application for the homestead exemption is to be provided to property 
owners, I suggest it is more efficiently handled by inclusion of the information or material in the property owner’s property tax bill, which is already required by law to be mailed to them and will catch them at a moment when their attention is focused on their taxes rather than a hundred other topics that people discuss at the real estate closing.

INSTRUCTIONS 
SECT
ION 1.   
Check the appropriate box related to each question.  Y ou must check all three boxes to qualify for the Maine 
homestead property  tax exemption.  If you have moved during the year and owned a homestead in Maine prior 
to your move, enter the address of the homes tead you moved from on line 1b.  Your ownership of a homestead 
must have been continuous for the 12-month period ending on April 1.  If you did not check all boxes in this 
section, you do not qualify for the homes tead property tax exemption.    
Line 1a:  "Permanent resident" means an individual who has es tablished a permanent residenc e.  A “permanent 
residence” means that place where an individual has a true, fixed, and permanent home and principal 
establishment to which the indiv idual, whenev er absent, has the intention of returning.  An individual may hav e 
only one permanent residence at a time and, once a permanent residence is  established, that residence is 
presumed to continue until circumstances  indicate otherwise. 
A person on active duty serving in the Armed Forces of the United States who is permanently s tationed at a 
military or nav al post, station or base in this state is deemed to be a permanent Maine resident.  A person on 
active duty  serving in the Armed Forces of the United States does not include a member of the National Guard 
or the Reserves .   
Line 1b:  “Homestead” means residential real property owned by an individual or individuals and occupied by 
those indiv iduals as their permanent residence.  Residentia l real property held in a revocable living trust for a 
beneficiary  who occupies the property as his or her per manent residence also qualifies as a homes tead.     
An owner of a life estate is  considered the owner of the property for purpos es of the homestead exemption; 
however, the owner of a life lease is not.  A resident homeowner who is subjec t to foreclosure and subs equently 
purchas es the home back from the municipality is co nsidered to have no interruption in homeownership for 
purposes of this exemption.      
SECTION 2.  Enter your full name(s) as  shown on your property  tax bill, the physical location of your home, your 
telephone number, email address, and your mailing address, if different than the phys ical location. 
SECTION 3.  This section gives the local assessor informat ion which may be used to determine if you qualify 
and should support your answers to the ques tions in Section 1.  Please chec k the appropriate box for each of 
the applicable statements in this section. 
At least one of the owners of the homestead must sign this document.  Pleas e file the applic ation with your 
local municipal assessor.  If, for any reason, you are denied exemption by the assessor, you may 
appeal the assessor’s decision under the abatement process found in 36 M.R.S. § 841.
