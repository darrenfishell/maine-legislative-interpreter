Greetings,  I am an attorney at law and have been involved with doing closings for in 
excess of 40 years and have conducted thousands of closings.  I think the objective of 
bringing the homestead exemption to the attention of purchasers is laudable but this is
imposing another burden on closing agents which will undoubtedly result in 
additional costs to the Buyers.  I certainly intend to include a separate fee on the 
closing statement for this item should it pass, and given the fact that I would be taking
liability for getting it to the municipality, it would not be insignificant.  Closing 
agents deal with properties in many different communities - not all of which have 
their information on line - so it will impose an additional burden to keep track of a 
multitude of assessors addresses.  There has to be a better way to do this without 
imposing an additional burden on the private sector.
