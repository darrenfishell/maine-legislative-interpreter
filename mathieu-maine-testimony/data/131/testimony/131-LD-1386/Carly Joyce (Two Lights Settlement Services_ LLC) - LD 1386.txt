To Whom It May Concern: 
I am writing today to provide feedback on this bill. As a settlement agent that handles 
roughly 2000 closings a year this bill creates some serious logistical and liability 
concerns. Providing the homestead exemption form to a buyer at closing would not be
an issue. Expecting the settlement agent to complete and submit the form on behalf of
the buyer would create a host of problems. If the form is completed incorrectly or not 
received by the Town then this opens up the settlement agent to liability if the 
homeowner decides to take legal action. It is also a logistical nightmare because if we 
submit the forms to the Town after the closing and the homeowner doesn't qualify for 
the homestead exemption until 12 months later I am not sure how the Town would 
keep track of these forms or if they would even hold on to them for 12 months. Not to
mention we would likely not have all of the necessary information to complete the 
form nor should we be completing this document on behalf of the buyer. I understand 
what the bill is trying to accomplish but to place this responsibility on the settlement 
agent seems misguided. Requiring settlement agents to the provide the form itself as 
part of the closing would not be an issue but requiring settlement agents to complete 
and submit the form would create more issues in my opinion. I would urge the 
committee to reconsider the wording of this bill.
