Senator Matthew Pouliot 
Testimony for 
LD 1386, “An Act to Require That a Completed Form for the Homestead 
Property Tax Exemption Be Provided to a Person Purchasing a Home.” 
April 13, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation. I am Senator Matt Pouliot and I represent Senate District 
15, central Kennebec County. I am here to present LD 1386, An Act to Require 
That a Completed Form for the Homestead Property Tax Exemption Be Provided 
to a Person Purchasing a Home. 
This bill is designed to require that settlement agents present those purchasing 
property with a Maine resident homestead property tax exemption form. It does not 
require buyers to follow through with the application process, but merely will make 
the option known and available in every instance. Should the buyer elect to apply, 
the settlement agent will then be required to submit the information to the municipal 
assessor to consider the merits, whereby a value of $25,000 Will be subtracted from 
the property evaluation to lessen their tax burden in the event that it is accepted. 
Maine’ s homestead tax exemption program exists as a potentially signiﬁcant source 
of ﬁnancial relief for Maine residents, and this legislation will make great strides 
in both securing its general availability and enhancing the awareness of its 
existence. As it currently stands, this option remains relatively unknown to many 
prospective homeowners and it would be a tremendous disservice to keep it in 
obscurity. This bill Will ensure that everybody will be presented with the option. 
Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.
