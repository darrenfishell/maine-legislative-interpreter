As a Real Estate Settlement Agent, I have reservations as to the unintended effect 
on settlement agents with LD 1386. These include the time and associated costs 
involved to obtain information, to complete the form on behalf of the purchaser 
of property, and to distribute to the municipality.   
 I do agree with the intention of informing Maine Residents as to the Homestead 
Property Tax Exemption and how to apply if they in fact qualify.  It is information 
that should be readily available to the consumer.  It should continue to be the 
responsibility of the buyer to request the benefit of the exemption. 
Would it not be a reasonable practice to have the application form for said 
exemption available online with each municipality ?  In a brief search, I did find 
that many towns already have this available on their websites.     
I have read testimony from other associated businesses, municipalities and 
organizations. It appears that there is no dissent from the intention of informing 
the consumer, but there is certainly opposition as to the manner in which that 
happens, and to whom the responsibility belongs.  
Additionally the timeframe of 2 business days for recordings is not possible in 
counties, such as Somerset, that do not have the capacity for e-recording of 
documents.  Settlement agents make every effort to record documents as quickly 
as possible, as an industry standard. 
I believe this bill was submitted with good intentions,  but oppose it as written.
