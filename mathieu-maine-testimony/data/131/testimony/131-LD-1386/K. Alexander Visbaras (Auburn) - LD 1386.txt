LD 1386
As a practicing Maine attorney who has represented, over 35 years, thousands of 
buyers of Maine residential real estate as their settlement agent, placing the burden 
upon settlement agents to comply with the proposed LD is both onerous and 
dangerous.  Providing a homestead exemption form will unduly add to an already 
substantial amount of information presented to buyers at closings.  Agents would be 
deemed responsible for critical buyer representations that they cannot verify, and will 
repeatedly expose them to repeated and potentially significant liability claims.  
Furthermore, mandating that these agents then take separate steps to submit these 
forms to the proper municipal officials will undoubtedly increase costs, and burden 
agents for a post closing, buyer-specific matter for which the agent has no interest.  
Most real estate brokers we deal with already provide numerous forms for the benefit 
of the consumer/buyer before a sale is concluded.   It therefore would be logical and 
practical to have brokers provide this form. It should thereafter be left to the buyer, 
the party solely responsible for the representations made in that form, to complete the 
process if they choose to and deal with any ramifications, positive or negative, 
resulting from their submission.  Thank you
