Good afternoon - I am taking this opportunity to comment briefly on the bill to 
require the closing agent to provide inforamtion or an application for the homestead 
exemption to buyers. I have a couple of problems with this bill, as a closing agent 
myself. 
- Our closing files are already in excess of 200 pages when a lender is involved. 
- Our processors have only so much time to devote to each file. 
-  We earn the smallest amount per file of any party to the transaction yet we are 
exected to follow through on all the most important details including the withholding 
for out of state sellers and the Maine transfer tax. 
- Eligibility for the homestead exemption doesn't begin until a year or more after the 
purchase so this creates confusion around the timing. 
- Many people sell or move out of properties before they ever reach eligibility.
