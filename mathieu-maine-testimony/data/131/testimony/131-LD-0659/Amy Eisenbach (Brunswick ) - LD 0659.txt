 Subject: LD 659 An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and  
Community Supports Across the Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and 
Developmental Disabilities or Autism 
 
March 29, 2023 
 
 
 I am Amy Eisenbach Adult Community Case Manager with Independence 
Association in Brunswick. We are a non-profit organization that has supported 
people with Intellectual Disabilities since 1966. I am also the sister and guardian 
of a sister with Down Syndrome, Mile ID and deaf who resides in a waiver funded 
group living.  I am submitting written testimony regarding RE: LD 659: An Act to 
Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports Across the 
Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or 
Autism.  
I am testifying neither for nor against LD 659. It is far too early to support or 
reject a bill that is still in concept. In theory, LD 659 allows for better informed 
systems to identify individuals early on, for their budgetary needs as they get 
older. I have two major concerns that I would like to express below:  
1. Major Substantive: In Section 1 of the LD, it recommends the department to 
adopt this bill as routine technical. I urge you and the HHS Committee to 
reconsider this recommendation and make it a major substantive. This waiver 
portends to replace Sections 20, 21 and 29 of the MaineCare Benefits Manual. 
This legislation is major and will become the single most expensive portion of the 
Home and Community Based Waiver system in the state.  
2. Stakeholder Input: Once again, I hear from my peer providers, as well as 
family members with whom I work, that the Life Span Waiver stakeholder 
committee fails to recognize the opinions and input from providers and family 
members on that committee. Although providers and family members are present, 
unless they have similar views as DHHS/OADS, their concerns are not addressed. 2022 - 2023

I do not believe the HHS committee can make an impact on the operations of the committee, but 
they can address the ignored concerns by making the LD major substantive.
