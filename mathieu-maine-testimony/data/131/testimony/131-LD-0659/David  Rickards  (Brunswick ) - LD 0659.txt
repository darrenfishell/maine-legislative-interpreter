LD 659
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the HHS Committee,
My name is David Rickards and I live in Brunswick. I am the proud, but worried 
parent of a 43 year old man with medical, intellectual, and mental health disabilities. 
Our family is calling on you to amend LD 659 to major substantive. Thank you.
David Rickards
