Subject:   LD 659 An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and  
Community Supports Across the Lifespan for Individuals with 
Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism  
 
 
Date :   March 21, 2023  
 
I am Ray Nagel, th e Executive Director of Independence Association in 
Brunswick . We are a non -profit organization  that has supported people with 
Intellectual Disabilities since 1966.  I am submitting written testimony regarding 
RE: LD 659: An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community 
Supports Across the Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental 
Disabilities or Autism .   
 
I am testifying neither  for nor against LD 659.  It is far too early to sup port or 
reject a bill that is still in concept.  In theory, LD 659 allows for better informed 
systems to identify individuals early on, for their budgetary needs as they get 
older . I have two major concerns that I would like to express below:   
 
1.  Major Substant ive: In Section 1 of the LD, it recommends t he department to 
adopt this bill as routine technical .  I urge you and the HHS Committee to  
reconsider this recommendation a nd make it a major substantive .  This waiver 
portends to replace Section s 20,  21 and 2 9 of the MaineCare Benefits Manual. 
This legislation is major and will become the single most expensive p ortion of the 
Home and Community Based Waiver system in the sta te.   
 
2.  Stakeholder Inp ut:  Once again, I hear from my peer providers,  as well as 
family members w ith whom I work, that the Life Span Waiver stakeholder 
committee fails to recognize the opinions and input from providers and family 
members on that committee.  Although providers and family  members are present, 
unless they have similar views as DHHS/OADS, their concerns are not addressed.

I do n ot believe  the HHS commi ttee can mak e an impact on th e operations  of the committee , but 
they can address the ignore d concerns by making the LD major substantive.    
 
Thank you for allowing me to voice my concerns.
