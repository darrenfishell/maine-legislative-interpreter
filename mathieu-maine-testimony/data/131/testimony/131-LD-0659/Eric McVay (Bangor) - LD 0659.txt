Testimony in support of: 
LD 659 “An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports Across 
the Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism”
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
My name is Eric McVay and I live in Bangor and I am a self-advocate. I am here today to testify 
in support of LD 659 which would create a Lifespan waiver for folks with Developmental 
Disabilities. I think a Lifespan Waiver will create a lot more opportunities for us. It will also 
make it easier to access community supports and community activities. 
I have a had a lot of issues being able to access services and the services I access have a cap. I 
think this Lifespan Waiver can help with the problems of services being capped because it will 
include a system to measure the needs of support, rather than having to fit into a system where 
you are capped for hours regardless of the need. 
I strongly urge you to move ought to pass on this bill. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Eric McVay
