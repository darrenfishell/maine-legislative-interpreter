Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyers and the members of the HHS 
Committee,
I am Amy Mulligan and I live in Bowdoinham. I strongly encourage you to amend 
this bill to be considered major-substantive as these type of services require and 
deserve further consideration. 
Thank You,
Amy Mulligan
