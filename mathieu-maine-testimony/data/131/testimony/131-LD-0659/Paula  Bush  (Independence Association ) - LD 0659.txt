I have worked in the field of Intellectual Disabilities for over 25 years, and have seen 
the positive and negative impacts of how funding and supports affect individual and 
family lives.   It can create significant barriers to basic health and safety and it can 
provide opportunities for people to develop lives that offer significant feedback to 
their communities.  The LifeSpan Wavier will replace Section 20, 21, and 29 of the 
Mainecare benefits and  is a major factor in what will be available for supports in the 
future of children and adults in this state.   Please consider making this rule major 
substantiative, peoples lives and futures depend on it.     Give stakeholders an 
opportunity to have a voice in this process.   
Thank you.
