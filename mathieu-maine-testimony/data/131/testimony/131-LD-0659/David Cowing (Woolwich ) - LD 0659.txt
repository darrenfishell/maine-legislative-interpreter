Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyers and HHS Committee members,  
My name is David Cowing and I live in Woolwich.  I strongly encourage you to 
amend this bill to allow it to be considered major-substantive. Given the significant 
changes in how supports for people with disabilities will be made available to them, it
is critical that legislative oversight be built into the change process.
Thank You,
 David Cowing
