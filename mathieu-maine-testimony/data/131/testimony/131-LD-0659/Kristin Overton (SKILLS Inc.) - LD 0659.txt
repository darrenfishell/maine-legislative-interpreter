Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyers, and honorable members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee:' 
My name is Kristin Overton and I am the Executive Director of SKILLS, Inc., a role I assumed in July. 
SKILLS is a non-proﬁt organization in central Maine, serving people with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities for more than 60 years. SKILLS provides more than 110 people with 24/7 
residential support and day programming under Sections 21, 29, and 97-F. I am here today to testify 
neither for nor against LD 659: An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community 
Supports Across the Liﬁzspan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism 
and to request that this legislation be considered for major substantive rulemaking. 
I am happy to share the Department ’s vision for expanding services and providing better transitions 
between youth and adult services. I also applaud the Department for seeking ways to bring more 
ﬂexibility into the services provided, however I am also uncertain. As a provider, there aren’t enough 
details in the legislation to fully understand the impact this will have on the people we support, on their 
families, and on providers. The Lifespan waiver is seeking to change many things; the services that 
have been suggested, but not yet determined, are primarily new services without deﬁnition at this time. 
The cross-walk of services between Sections 13, 21, and 29, and the new Waiver has not been 
completed. 
The transition between child and adult services is difﬁcult because change and transitions are hard. 
January 2025 is very close and new services take time to be fully understood by the people we support 
and providers. The Community Membership service, initiated during COVID, is one of the most needed

and exciting services that hint at What’s to come. However, 2 years later case managers and people 
receiving the service are still considering it as no different than 1 on 1 community support rather than as 
an opportunity to build meaningful relationships that could and should eventually supplant the DSP’s 
role from the forefront to the background. 
The Lifespan Waiver presents many opportunities, but also raises many questions regarding timing, 
service level eligibility, the provision of service delivery, maintaining coordination and communication 
between providers, establishing the licensing of providers, rate determinations, and how people with 
fewer needs and those with much greater needs will each receive the right support, at the right time, and 
in the right setting. 
With such a complex delivery mechanism, soon to be the only mechanism for the people we support, I 
ask that the necessary details and speciﬁcs of the waiver be included in statute to give guidance for the 
rule-making process. 
I believe that the State has a very difﬁcult job of developing this waiver, but one that is so very valuable 
and necessary. I ask that the policy cormnittee be provided the oversight and accountability required for 
a change of this magnitude. SKILLS thanks the committee and the department for considering ways 
that we can do better by the people we support, and we want to be a part of this exciting change.
