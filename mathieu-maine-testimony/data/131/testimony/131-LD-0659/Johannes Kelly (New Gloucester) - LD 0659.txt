LD 659
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyers and the members of the HHS 
Committee.  I am, Johannes Kelly and live in New Gloucester. After reading through 
Rep. Crockett's PDF for LD 659,  I would highly encourage you to amend this bill to 
be considered major-substantive.  
Thank You, 
Johannes Kelly
