Dear HHS Members,
I'd like to follow up about major substantive rules on the new lifespan waiver .
I continue to believe that it's essential under the principle of " Nothing About Us Without Us " for the lifespan waiver rules to
be major substantive, not routine technical.
A stakeholder raised a concern with me today that major substantive rules could delay implementation. My understanding
is that the lifespan waiver wouldn't start until January 2025, which should give time for the legislature to complete
legislative review of major substantive rules in advance of implementation.
In the event, however , that major substantive rules *would* delay implementation, the Legislature and the Department
already have a tool in the Maine Administrative Procedure Act to address that: "emergency major substantive rules". This
would allow the Department to adopt a rule temporarily without legislative review , and then to submit a regular major
substantive rule for legislative review afterwards. LD 659 could be amended to require DHHS to adopt major substantive
rules but also authorize DHHS to adopt "emergency major substantive rules" if necessary to avoid delay of initial
implementation. See 5 MRS ยง8073 .
Special education rules have frequently used these mechanisms. Maine Unified Special Education Regulation Chapter
101, for example, is a major substantive rule, and when it's been necessary to adopt changes faster than legislative
review would allow , DOE has adopted "emergency major substantive rules", followed by provisional adoption of a regular
major substantive rule, giving the EDU committee the opportunity to hold legislative review of the regular major
substantive rule.
This has of fered an important opportunity for course corrections that wouldn't have taken place without legislative review .
