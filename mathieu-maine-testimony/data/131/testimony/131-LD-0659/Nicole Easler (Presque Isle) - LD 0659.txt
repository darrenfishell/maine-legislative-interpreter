Testimony in support of: 
LD 659 “An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports Across 
the Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism”
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
My name is Nicole Easler and I live in Presque Isle. I am a self-advocate and I support LD 659. 
I support this bill because I believe younger people should have a much smoother transition than 
what I got. I also think it is important for individual needs to be assessed and for everyone to 
receive the services they need. We shouldn’t have to be overwhelmed and stressed about it. I just 
want a smoother transition and for everyone to get what they need and be able to choose their 
services.
I agree that the youth should get priority as well as people who have been sitting on the wait list 
for years. I have been sitting on the wait list for section 21 since 2016. I am really upset and 
angry because my caseworker submitted an update on my situation about my health issues in 
December and I have had no response.
I need services now and I can’t wait any longer for a waiver spot. My health issues are not going 
to get any better. I just can’t wait a bunch of more years for services. I do fine now, but what will 
happen when my health issues get worse. I also can’t get assistive technology and I need it.  I feel 
like they are not looking at things, but it isn’t helping people who have been on the wait list for 
years. 
I am hopeful that the Lifespan Waiver will help solve some of these issues like I have 
experienced. I would ask you to support LD 659 and vote to pass it. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Nicole Easler
