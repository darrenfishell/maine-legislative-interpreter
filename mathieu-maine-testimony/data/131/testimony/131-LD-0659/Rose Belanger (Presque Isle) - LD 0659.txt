Testimony in support of: 
LD 659 “An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports Across 
the Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism”
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
My name is Rose Belanger and I live in Presque Isle. I am a self-advocate and I support LD 659. 
I am on the stakeholder committee for the Lifespan Waiver and we have been discussing 
different ways that people will get the services they need. We have come across a bunch of 
different situation from different people who are concerned about people who live with 
disabilities getting the supports and services they need to access their community. 
I believe that once the younger group get the chance to experience this opportunity we should 
allow that chance for the section 21 and 29 members. I believe that doing so we can hopefully 
make it less stressful and less frustration to get the help that they need. This new waiver would 
solve problems with people moving from child services to adult services. From my own 
experience, it was very stressful when I graduated. I lost services for about 3 years during this 
time. It was very frustrating to try to get back onto services. I would rather not have other people 
go through the same thing I experienced. 
I would ask you to support LD 659 and vote to pass it. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Rose Belanger 
Presque Isle, ME
