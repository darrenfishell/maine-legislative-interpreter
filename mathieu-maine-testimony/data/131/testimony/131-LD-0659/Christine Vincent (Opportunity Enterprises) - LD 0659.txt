LD 659: An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports Across the Lifespan for 
Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services
March 21, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and esteemed members of the Health and 
Human Services Committees. 
My name is Christine Vincent.   I am the CEO of Opportunity Enterprises.  We provide home and 
community based services under sections 13, 21 and 29 in 14 counties in Maine.
I applaud the Department for reimagining services and supports for people with disabilities and for 
creating additional options under the proposed Lifespan Program. 
We especially appreciate the coordination between OADS and OCFS and the consideration that is being 
given to streamline entry into the adult system and to eliminate the longstanding “cliff” and waiting 
period that young adults with disabilities and their families face when aging out of the children’s 
services system in hopes of accessing services in the adult system.
As promising as the new waiver is, the prospect of launching a new system in less than two years from 
now is daunting. As a longstanding provider of Section 21 and 29 waiver services, I am unsure how best 
to prepare the people I support and my staff for what is to come in 2025. 
This is a significant redesign of the system which will impact all stakeholders. In order to ensure access 
to the services as intended we strongly encourage that rules related to the creation of services under 
the Lifespan Waiver by major substantive. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
 
Respectfully Submitted, 
Christine Vincent
CEO
