Dennis Dionne
Topsham
LD 659
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and the members of the HHS 
Committee,
My name is Dennis Dionne and I live in Topsham. I am the step-dad to a 43 year old 
woman with cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability with complex needs and is 
also non-verbal..  My step-daughter requires support for every aspect of her daily life. 
She has received quality supports and care from the DSPs that work in her group 
home for the past 22 years. I have grave concerns that her group home will be forced 
to eventually close through attrition if the LD 659 / the Lifespan Waiver is passed as 
written.
I would highly encourage you to amend this LD 659 to be considered 
major-substantive. 
 
Thank You,
Dennis Dionne
Topsham, Maine
