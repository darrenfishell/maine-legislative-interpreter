LD 659
Good Morning,
As a parent and guardian of a young man with Down Syndrome, I urge you to move forward 
with LD 659: An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports 
Across the Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism.
We are grateful for any assistance he is eligible for from the State of Maine, and this Act will 
give him a chance of receiving housing and seamless community support for his lifetime and 
before we die. Presently at 26 years old he is not eligible for any housing where he could live 
independently or with a peer or two with support in an inclusive neighborhood setting.  We 
supplement care for him privately and will continue to do so for his lifetime but this Act will 
ensure a good life for him and for he lives of many others. Thank you for your consideration.
