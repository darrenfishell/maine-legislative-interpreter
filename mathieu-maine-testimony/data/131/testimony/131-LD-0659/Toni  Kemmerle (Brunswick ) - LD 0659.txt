LD 659
Members of the Health and Human Services Committee,
LD 659, if enacted, will allow DHHS to make substantial and permanent changes to 
the way that services are provided to Mainers with intellectual disabilities and autism 
without further legislative oversight and with very limited opportunities for input 
from people served, their families or advocates. The system changes are described 
very vaguely. In fact, the LD is a long list of general aspirations without details of any
kind. Please consider requiring DHHS to go through major substantive rule making to
redesign its service delivery system. The changeover to the lifespan waiver is a drastic
one that could have many unforeseen consequences and lasting impacts on many 
lives. Major substantive rule making is appropriate and legally required.
