Testimony in support of: 
LD 659 “An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports Across 
the Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism”
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a person with a disability. I am also a self-
advocate and I work for Speaking Up For Us (SUFU). 
I want you to know that I support this bill. I like the fact that they are moving in the right 
direction to get everyone off the wait list.  This bill will affect me directly by getting supports in 
my own place, increase my skills while I learn how to take care of my own tasks such as filing 
my taxes. It supports the utilization of my natural supports.  I recommend putting in place a 
system of checks and balances to deal with issues that a new program will see as they arise. 
This bill will help people be prepared for their future by thinking about what is available after 
high school. I want to see kids be thinking about their future and options before they become an 
adult. This lifespan waiver will help them do that by starting at age 14. 
People will be able to get supportive services to find a future that better suits them. They will 
have an opportunity to learn every day life skills with supports and there will be no dead ends for 
people with the Life Span Waiver.  
I strongly urge you to support LD 659.
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Jon McGovern
