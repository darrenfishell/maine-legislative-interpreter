Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyers and members of the HHS Committee. 
I am Timothy S Christopher and live in Brunswick. I have worked with adults with 
intellectual disabilities now, going on 27 years here in Brunswick Maine. I would 
highly encourage you to amend this bill to be considered Major-Substantive. It is time
that the people I serve, deserve and realise the promises that were once made to them. 
Thank you, Timothy Christopher. Caregiver, etc.
