LD 659
Hello, My name is Rebecca Hill and I am a Community Case Manager for adults at 
Independence Association in Brunswick. We are a non-profit organization that has 
supported people with Intellectual Disabilities since 1966. I am submitting written 
testimony regarding RE: LD 659: An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home 
and Community Supports Across the Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and 
Developmental Disabilities or Autism.
I am testifying neither for nor against LD 659. It is far too early to support or reject a 
bill that is still in concept. In theory, LD 659 allows for better informed systems to 
identify individuals early on, for their budgetary needs as they get older. I have two 
major concerns that I would like to express below:
1. Major Substantive: In Section 1 of the LD, it recommends the department to adopt 
this bill as routine technical. I urge you and the HHS Committee to reconsider this 
recommendation and make it a major substantive. This waiver portends to replace 
Sections 20, 21 and 29 of the MaineCare Benefits Manual. This legislation is major 
and will become the single most expensive portion of the Home and Community 
Based Waiver system in the state.
2. Stakeholder Input: Once again, I hear from my peer providers, as well as family 
members with whom I work, that the Life Span Waiver stakeholder committee fails to
recognize the opinions and input from providers and family members on that 
committee. Although providers and family members are present, unless they have 
similar views as DHHS/OADS, their concerns are not addressed.
I do not believe the HHS committee can make an impact on the operations of the 
committee, but they can address the ignored concerns by making the LD major 
substantive. 
Thank you for allowing me to voice my concerns.
Rebecca Hill
