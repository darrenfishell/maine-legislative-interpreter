Testimony of Todd Goodwin, CEO, John F. Murphy Homes, Inc.
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
Testifying Neither For Nor Against 
L.D. 659, An Act to Promote Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports Across the 
Lifespan for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism 
March 21, 2023
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services, my name is Todd Goodwin. I serve as CEO of John F. Murphy 
Homes, Inc., a provider of disability services based in Auburn, Maine. We serve both children 
and adults. I am testifying neither for nor against in support of L.D. 659, An Act to Promote 
Seamless and Flexible Home and Community Supports Across the Lifespan for Individuals with 
Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities or Autism.
I appreciate the Department’s intention to streamline entry into the adult disability 
system for children as they age out of the children’s system. Moreover, I support the idea of 
building flexibilities into a Medicaid waiver program that can respond effectively to a person’s 
needs as they age.
A significant redesign of the state’s disability system as proposed here is by definition a 
major substantive rule. As a program that will affect thousands of Maine lives, the Lifespan 
Waiver will clearly require “the exercise of significant agency discretion or interpretation in 
drafting” as outlined in MRS 375, Subchapter 2-A, §8071(B)(1). I hope you also recognize this 
and work to ensure full legislative review of the Department’s proposal before formal adoption.
Respectfully submitted,
Todd Goodwin
