LD 659
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyers, and other members of the HHS Committee.
My name is John Lacharite.  I live in the City of Ships, Bath, Maine.  I am writing to 
ask that you would amend the bill LD 659 to be considered major-substantive.  I 
appreciate your time and attention to this critically important matter.
Thank you.
