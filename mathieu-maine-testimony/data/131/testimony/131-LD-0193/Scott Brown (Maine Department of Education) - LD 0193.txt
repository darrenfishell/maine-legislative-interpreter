Senator Rotundo , Representative Sachs , and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs : 
LD 193, An Act to Provide Excess General Fund Revenue to the School Revolving Renovation Fund and 
the Education Stabilization Fund , proposes that any General Fund unappropriated surplus is to be 
distributed at the end of the fiscal year. The bill distributes 20% to the School Revolving Renovation 
Fund and 20% to the Education Stabilization Fund.  
The School Revolving Renovation Fund (S RRF) provides funding assistance to school administrative 
units (SAUs) to ensure that students have a safe, healthy and appropriate learning environment. The fund 
is authorized in Title 30-A, ยง 6006 -F and administered jointly with the Maine Municipal Bond Bank.  The 
SRRF offers funding where SAUs have identified needs in the areas of health and safety, building 
systems, energy and water conservation, and learning space upgrades. The fund provides  loans to SAUs 
to finance project expenditures. A portion of each loan is considered a grant and is forgiven. The 
forgiveness rate ranges from 30 percent to 70 percent and is based on the percentage of State subsidy paid 
to the local SAU. The remaining bal ance of the loan is paid back over either five or 10 years at a 0 
percent interest rate. The loan repayments revolve back into the SRRF and are then used to fund other 
approved  projects.   Currently, the SRRF consist s of seven possible funding sources defin ed in Title 30 -A, 
ยง 6006 -F. 
The Education Stabilization Fund  per Title 20 -A, ยง15698  authorizes the State Controller to transfer from 
the balance avail able in the fund an amount for essential programs and services payments to the 
Department  of Education  in order to prevent any reduction in the state share percentage of the statewide 
adjusted total cost of the comp onents of essential programs and services pursuant to Title 20 -A, ยง15671, 
subsection 7, paragraph B that would otherwise result from insufficie nt Gener al Fund appropriations or 
any other shortage of funds.  
Specifying the use of unappropriated General Fund surplus  will both ensure that funding is available for 
important purposes and narrow the possibility for the use of those funds.                                                                                                                   
 
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 193 and respond to  any 
questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
