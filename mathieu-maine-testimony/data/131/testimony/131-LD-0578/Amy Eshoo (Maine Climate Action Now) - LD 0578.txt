Re: LD 578: RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine Concerning 
the Publication of Maine Indian Treaty Obligations - OUGHT TO PASS
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Committee on Judiciary, my 
name is Amy Eshoo. I am a resident of North Yarmouth and Director of Maine Climate Action 
Now, a statewide coalition of 15 social justice and climate justice grassroots organizations. We 
support transformative action in response to the climate crisis. We hold social, racial, and 
economic justice as critical to the transition to zero carbon emissions by 2030.
I would like to thank the sponsor of this bill, Senator Bennett, for bringing it forth. As an 
organization we support bringing equity forward so that we as a state can move forward 
together in the face of the climate crisis.
We recognize that it does not appear that the amendment of 1876, removing Article X, Section 5 
from printed copies of the Constitution, was intended to take away any rights from Maine’s tribal 
communities. The amendment and the hiding of the language about the State’s duties and 
obligations did not actually change the State’s relationship with tribes. We feel that what is 
important today is transparency and accountability in state/tribal relations. It is important to 
Maine Climate Action Now that recognition of the Maine/Wabanaki relationship and history be 
reflected in making Article X, Section 5 visible. We believe that recognizing the complex history 
of treaties, negotiations, and power inequalities is important. 
We urge the Committee to vote Ought to Pass for LD 578. Thank you.
