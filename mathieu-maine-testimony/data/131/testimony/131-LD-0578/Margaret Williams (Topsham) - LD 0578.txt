During my education at Skowhegan Area High School, I did not learn in detail about 
the long history of relations between the States of Maine and Massachusetts and the 
Wabanaki tribes. But at the end of my college education,  I spent a week at the 
Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center women's leadership training. It was here that I 
learned that the Maine Legislature does not print a section of our Constitution that 
clarifies Maineâ€™s obligation to uphold and defend treaties made between 
Massachusetts and the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot Nations. It was my first 
glimpse at that relationship and I was disappointed. I immediately understood this to 
be a sign that the State government wanted to hide a responsibility it had and prevent 
the good conscience of its legislators from recognizing all the various ways it violates 
it own rule of law,  deceiving and harming Maine's people. Please pass this resolution 
to print the entire Constitution without omissions.
