RE: LD 755 - An Act to Promote Higher Blends of Biofuel by Regulating the Sale or 
Transfer of Biofuels.  
 
Dear Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and honored members of the Innovation, 
Development, Economic Advancement and Business  Committee,  
 
Global Partners LP (Global) appreciates the opportunity to present comments in support of LD 
755 - An Act to Prom ote Higher Blends of Biofuel by Regulating the Sale or Transfer of 
Biofuels.  
 
We have seen the heating industry continuously evolve since our company began 90 years ago 
with a single truck delivering heating oil that provided warmth to Boston area business es and 
families during the Great Depression.  Biodiesel is key to this evolution and a successful energy 
transition that reduces greenhouse gas emissions.1 That’s why the Maine Won’t Wait Climate 
Action Plan calls for the increased use of biofuel and biodi esel production and use.2 The 
American Lung Association also supports the use of biofuel blends in heating oil.3  
 
While technical in nature, LD 755 is a simple bill that clarif ies the definition of biodiesel by 
linking it to widely utilized  ASTM International standards . This clarification ensures that 
biodiesel distributed in Maine meets widely utilized product quality standards that are utilized in 
commerce and other jurisdictions, which should provide comfort to fuel dealer s to utilize this 
fuel and should be encouraged  to help achieve Maine’s climate goals.  
 
We humbly urge the Committee to pass  LD 755 .
