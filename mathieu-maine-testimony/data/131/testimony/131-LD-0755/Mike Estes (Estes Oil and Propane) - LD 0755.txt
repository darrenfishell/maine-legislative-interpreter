Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and Members of the IDEA Committee: 
My name is Mike Estes. I am owner of Estes Oil & I?rogpane_in_Y_orkgand Lake;

.. _. 12'] I am also Palmer in Bioﬁne 
Developments Northeast or “BDNE,” which has worked with the University of Maine to develop 
a fuel known as “ethyl levulinate ” or “EL.” 
EL is a next-generation cellulosic biofuel derived from a variety of feedstocks including woody 
biomass, forestry and agricultural wastes and residues, and municipal solid waste. BDNE is 
working to build an EL bio-reﬁnery in Lincoln. EL is a net-negative carbon fuel that can be used 
as a drop-in substitute for heating oil and has the potential signiﬁcantly reduce Maine’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
I am here today in support of LD755, a bill to allow energy marketers the legal right to sell up to 
20% biofuel blends, or “B20,” in the state of Maine. I will note that B20 blends‘ 
are already 
allowed under ASTM standards D6571 and D7467; and last year Underwriter ’s Laboratory 
updated their UL 296 safety standard for liquid fuel bumers to include blends of up to 100%, or 
“B 1 00.” 
With ASTM and UL approvals, manufacturers of space heating appliances and equipment are 
embracing these fuels and taking steps to support these higher blends. Sid Harvey is 
remanufacturing fuel pumps that are rated for B20. RW Beckett Corporation just put a new B100 
burner into production, and Energy Kinetics, a manufacturer of liquid-fuel ﬁred boilers, plans to 
migrate to B100 certiﬁed burners. Carlin Industries is working with NORA and BDNE to 
develop a 100-percent EL burner that will focus on large commercial accounts, and Bates 
College and the University of Maine have expressed interest. 
The United States Congress also supports higher blends of renewable liquid heating fuels..The 
federal Inﬂation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden last summer, offers a $600 
tax credit for installation of an efficient liquid fuel-ﬁred furnace or boiler that is certiﬁed for use 
with a minimum blend of B20. That credit is available now. 
Thanks to fuels such as biodiesel and EL, Maine’s energy marketers are an active part of the 
solution to reducing emissions and improving the environment in our state. LD755 will clarify 
any misunderstanding about What blends can be sold in Maine and pave the way for even greater 
emissions reductions. 
Thank you for allowing me to speak with you today and I hope you will vote this bill out of 
committee with a unanimous ought to pass vote.
