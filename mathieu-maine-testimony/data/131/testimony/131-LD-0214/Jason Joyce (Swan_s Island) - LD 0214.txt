LD 214
 Dear Members of the Housing Committee,
 As a selectboard member in a small town,  I am opposed to any overreach by the 
state into local zoning issues addressed by our local zoning boards. Local zoning is 
handled by elected members of our town and have the support of our townspeople to 
handle our local housing issues. 
 I encourage you all to support ld 214, and exempt small towns under 10,000 citizens 
from the requirements mandated in 2022 by ld2003's passage into law. Thank 
you-Jason Joyce
