LD 214
Dear Chairperson and Committee Members,
 We implore that you support LD214 regarding
limited state government control and exempting towns with
less than 10,000 residents from having forced growth plans by
those other than town governing bodies. Thank You for your time.
                                                              
                                                             Robert Rosati and Family
                                                               Livermore Falls,Me
