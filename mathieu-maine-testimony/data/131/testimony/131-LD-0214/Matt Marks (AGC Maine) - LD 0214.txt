 RE: AGC Maine’s Opposition to LD 214 “An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding Zoning and Land Use 
Restrictions to Limit Certain Requirements to Municipalities with a Population of More than 10,000”  
 
Senator Pierce , Representative Gere , and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Housing my name  is Matthew Marks,  I am a Principal at Cornerstone  Government  Affairs,  and writing  
today  on behalf of my client  The Associated  General  Contractors  of Maine.  AGC  Maine  is a statewide 
commercial construction  trade  association  and a Chapter of AGC  America.  
 The statewide housing challenge i mpacts both rural and urban areas of ou r state. The goals within LD 
2003 to expand the capacity of multi -family units will assist with the growing list of housing needs. As  
economic op portunities expand throughout the state it ’s essential to allow greate r density in areas 
already zoned  for housing.  
 Developers exploring Maine as a viable option analyze the available workforce and housing capacity of the pote ntial development area and that ’s not exclusive to pop ulatio ns greater than 10,000 current 
residents . Accor ding to 2021 population data , this bill would exclude  497 Maine commu nities. The State 
continues to invest in resources to assist m unicipalities with housing and zoning policies.  
 In our opinion , this has the p otential to create greater urban growth  and reduce econo mic growth in 
areas t hat can provide both jobs and an expanded tax base. Maine has already heard challenges from 
biotechn ology firms in Bar Harbor recruiting workers directly  tied to  the lack of housing.  It’s clear 
housing challenges are reaching e very corner  of Maine.  
 LD 2003 create s investment opportunities in housing directly  impacting construction jobs  in rural areas . 
It will also assi st property owners w ho qualify under the ne w law to earn income to offset inflation. 
Maine  has an estimated  19,000  housing units1 required  to meet  the demand  of low-income  residents.  
Home  prices2 in Maine  were  up 9.9%  year- over -year  in February.  At the same  time,  the number  of 
homes  sold fell 20.0%  and the number  of homes  for sale fell 12.6%.  The median  home  price  has risen  to 
$335,000, while  in February  2020 , the price  was $220,400.   
 
We encourage  the Committee to reject  this bill and allow  LD 2003  to have  the time  needed  before  
analyzing  the results.
