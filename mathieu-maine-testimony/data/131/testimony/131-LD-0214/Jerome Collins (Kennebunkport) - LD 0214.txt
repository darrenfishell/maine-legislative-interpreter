Subject: LD 214: Managing Growth In Your Town 
To Members of the Maine Legislature's Housing Committee 
Please, support LD214 which corrects the law passed last year (LD2004), which, uncorrected, will 
have a financially crippling effect on residents and small municipalities.: 
l ask members of this Committee on Housing to support LD214, because it provides significant relief 
to small towns (under 10,000 population) from a law passed last year (LD 2004). 
-Small Maine towns will be hard pressed to afford the necessary infra structures needed to support the 
increased housing and increased populations facilitated by LD 2004. Think about increases in WATER 
SEWAGE DISPOSAL, GARBAGE COLLECTION, POLICE AND SECURITY, EDUCATIONAL 
SERVICES, SOCIAL SERVICES, all costly services. Increases in these infrastructure supports will be 
punitive in dramatically increased costs for small towns and their residents.9 
-Climate, environmental and esthetic disasters will be caused by LD 2004's increased housing and 
populations Without appropriate supports. Destruction of oxygen-producing plants and trees, loss of farm land.

-Tourism will be severely impacted. Who Wants to visit or vacation in a slum? Loss of personal 
revenues. Loss of state taxes. 
-Loss of local municipal control over its own territory. Local voters disenfranchised by state takeover of 
decision-making. 
-Profound increase in "social unrest" is another predictable outcome of an uncorrected LD 2004. Please, use 
you vote on this committee to pass LD 214. 
LD 214 Ought to pass.
