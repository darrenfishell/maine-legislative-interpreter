LD 214
Maine must not lose control of its local housing laws.  Outlawing single family homes
would be the most drastic attack on our national and local family structure.  Forced 
low income housing, as well as multi-family housing could change the character of 
every Maine community.  Please pass LD214 and give this power back to each 
community, where it belongs.
