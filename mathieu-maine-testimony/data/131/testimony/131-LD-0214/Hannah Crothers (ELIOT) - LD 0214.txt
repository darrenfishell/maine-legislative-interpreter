LD 214
To the Joint Standing Committee on Housing:
Good day to you all. I wish to strongly urge you to adopt into law LD 214. It provides
protection to small towns who lack both the budget and necessity to implement LD 
2003. In large towns and cities, the measures in LD 2003 are helpful, if not necessary,
for the local government that already struggles for assistance in providing housing for 
large numbers of residents, low income or not. In small towns, however, they are 
impractical.
Another concern is the affordability of new housing units. In my small town, an 
apartment complex was built with the intention of providing low income senior 
citizens with affordable housing. Since it has been in operation, at least two people I 
know, who are eligible for housing at that complex, have said that they would not be 
able to afford the monthly rent.  Even if the measures for housing in LD 2003 were 
implemented, the residents of  various low income communities  and small towns 
may not even be able to afford the housing built, regardless of the best intentions of 
those who passed LD 2003 into law. Inflation and rising housing and utilities costs 
only increase that difficulty. In the instance mentioned above, the only benefit of  the 
low income housing project is the income of person or persons who collect the rent 
from that complex. This instance happened without LD 2003 being law. If LD 2003 is
implemented in small towns, I am afraid the same would be true and widespread. This
should not be the case.
Again, I strongly urge you to adopt into law LD 214. 
Thank you all for your time.
