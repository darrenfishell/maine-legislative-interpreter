Joseph Kumiszcza
Cumberland
LD 214
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and the distinguished members of the 
Committee on Housing, my name is Joseph Kumiszcza and I am a resident of 
Cumberland. I urge you to vote in support of LD 214: “An Act to Amend the Laws 
Regarding Zoning and Land Use Restrictions to Limit Certain Requirements to 
Municipalities with a Population of More than 10,000.” This bill will amend the 
zoning and land use regulations that were made law last year in LD 2003.
I support LD 214 because it allows lower populated municipalities to determine what 
land use and zoning policies make sense for the development or preservation of their 
locality. The search for "affordable housing" should begin in and focus on Maine's 
largest cities; mandates created during that search should not be applied to every 
community. If affordable housing is Cumberland County's primary issue then perhaps
Portland and South Portland should convert their municipal golf courses into new 
housing locations. LD 214 gives smaller communities the ability to preserve their 
unique character and sustain the positive characteristics of living in a small town.
