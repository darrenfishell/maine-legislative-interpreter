Good afternoon, chairpersons Gere and Pierce, and all members of the Housing Committee. My 
name is Josie Phillips, and l am representing Maine Center for Economic Policy. I am testifying 
in opposition to LDs 214, 665, and 1154 because they would significantly hinder much of the 
progress made in recent legislative sessions towards meeting the housing production needs of 
Maine communities. ln doing so, they would also hurt the wellbeing of Maine families and the 
stability of the state economy. 
More specifically, these bills would weaken LD 2003, passed in the 130"‘ legislature last year. 
The provisions included in LD 2003 will help us reduce the statewide shortage of affordable 
housing by increasing the allowed density of affordable housing developments and allowing for 
accessory dwelling units to be added onto existing residences. The need for these zoning 
reforms is severe, as the state has been chronically underproducing housing. ‘ Instead of 
improving Maine’s ability to produce and preserve affordable housing, LDs 214, 665, and 1154 
would weaken the state's ability to quickly meet these goals. 
LD 214 would limit LD 2003 to only apply to municipalities with populations greater than 10,000, 
but the affordable housing crisis is not limited to urban centers. Maine Housing has identified 
that in every county except Aroostook, the average home price exceeds what is affordable toa 
family earning the average income. This situation is even more dire for renters, as there is nota 
single area in the state where the fair market rent for a two-bedroom unit is affordable to the 
average renter household. “ The lack of affordable housing is impacting all areas of the state, 
and any policy solutions should reflect this by increasing housing production in both rural and 
urban areas. 
LD 665 would delay the requirements enacted in LD 2003 by two years. Maine's families and 
workforce cannot afford to wait this long. The shortage of affordable housing is already having 
severe impacts to the wellbeing of Mainers‘“ and the health of the state economy." 
Homelessness in Maine is increasing, “ and the lack of affordable housing is an impediment to 
economic growth, as workers are unable to find housing they can afford within a reasonable 
distance from theirjobs."' Multifamily housing development in the Northeast region takes more 
than 20 months to complete, on average," “ and LD 665 would add further delay to these 
developments. 
LD 1154 would significantly hinder LD 2003’s effectiveness by removing the requirement for 
municipalities to allow people to attach accessory dwelling units to their residential property. 
Enabling the production of accessory dwelling units can be a rapid, cost-effective way to 
increase the stock of affordable housing in Maine."“‘ As such, this committee should search for

ways to make the addition of accessory dwelling units easier and more accessible to Mainers of 
all income levels,“ not grant municipalities more leeway to further restrict housing production. 
LD 2003 was a critical first step towards enabling the state to meet its goals of housing 
production, which in turn enables Maine’s residents and economy to be healthier and more 
resilient. Taken in concert, LDs 214, 665, and 1154 would limit, delay, or roll back much of this 
progress. Mainers’ need for affordable housing is only growing stronger. Now is the time for the 
legislature to consider how to build upon the progress already made, not step back. Because 
these bills would hurt Maine’s ability to meet its current and future housing needs, I urge this 
committee to vote no on LDs 214, 665, and 1154.
