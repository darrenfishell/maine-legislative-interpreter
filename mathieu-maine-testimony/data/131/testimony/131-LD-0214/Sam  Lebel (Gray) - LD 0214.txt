LD 214
I am writing to oppose LD 214. Limiting aspects of LD 2003 to only 9 municipalities 
in the State is not enough to address the housing issues we face. LD 2003 was already
pared down several times before it was passed - keep the bill as is and open up 
opportunities across the State for additional housing particularly in existing 
developed/downtown areas where infill next to existing infrastructure and 
goods/services is feasible. It's time for all municipalities to join as one and 
acknowledge the archaic exclusionary zoning ordinances that have been limiting the 
growth of our State and putting emotional/financial stress on Mainers.
