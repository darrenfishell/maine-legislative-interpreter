Berwick
LD 214
As a resident of Berwick I support LD214.  Berwick has a population of 
approximately 8,000 people.  While our town is experiencing growth in recent years, 
we are still a small town when compared to larger cities such as Portland to the north. 
 
LD214 will uphold the rightful freedom of Berwick residents and local officials to 
make decisions regarding growth and development of our town guided by the specific
needs of our town--needs very different from larger cities and towns.
Let's continue to empower local towns to make their own decisions specific to their 
local needs.
