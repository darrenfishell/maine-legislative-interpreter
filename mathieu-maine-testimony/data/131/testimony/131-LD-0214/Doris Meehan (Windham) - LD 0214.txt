LD 214
I encourage you to support LD 214 so that some of the requirements passed in 
LD2003 last year will be restricted.  I don't even understand how that legislation was 
Constitutional!  Municipalities should be able to control or regulate growth within 
their own boundaries without Zoning and Land Use Regulations from Augusta!
          Please vote to support LD 214!
