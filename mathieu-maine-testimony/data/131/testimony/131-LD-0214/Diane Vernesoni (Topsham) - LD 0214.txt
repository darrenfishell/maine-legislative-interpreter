As of the 2020 census, there are 22 Maine towns with a population of 10,000 or more 
people.  This piece of legislation would make these towns a destination for anyone 
wishing to seek housing that is considered lower income driven.  These new housing 
units can have either 2 apartment type units or as many as 4 apartment units per lot 
where there is not already a dwelling.  This crowding of units and people is 
reminiscent of countries like China and Russian.  This is not conducive to 
improvement in living conditions for those who have financial problems.  One has 
only to look to the large cities of this country and the world to see what thus type of 
development does to comfortable, humane living.  This is not the way Maine should 
be, nor should we want Maine to be.  Please vote, "Ought Not TO Pass" on LD 214.  
Thank you.
