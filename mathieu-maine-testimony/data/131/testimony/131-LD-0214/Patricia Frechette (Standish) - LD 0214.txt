Dear Members of the Standing Committee:
I respectfully ask that you leave Zoning laws and Land Use Restrictions to the 
municipalities.  We do not need your help when it comes to development of our 
"Backyards".  We are quite capable of doing this on our own.  We do not need the 
State Government (BIG BROTHER) to "Takeover" our towns.  The State can't even 
manage it's own government, so what makes you think you can handle ours also?  
Please leave us alone!
