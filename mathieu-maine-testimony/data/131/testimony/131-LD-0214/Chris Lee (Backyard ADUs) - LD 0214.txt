Backyard ADUs
LD 214
Delaying the enaction of this bill, especially the ADU component,  would impact 
people who simply do not have time to wait. The average person building and then 
living in an ADU is a senior in their 60s. They are trying to downsize, receive help 
from their children as they age, and spend more time with grandchildren.
As many know, the average lifespan in the united states is 76. Delaying the billâ€™s 
implementation by even 1 more year may steal 10%, or more,  of one of these 
grandparent time left living closer to their families. 
IN just the past 3 years of working with families and building ADUs, we have 
examples of elderly grandparents suffering falls that could have been prevented if 
they lived closer to their children in assessable spaces. These falls put these 
grandparents into assisted living, cost the state unnecessary expense, and stripped 
them of their chance to live closer to family in their later years. 
We urge you not to extend the implementation timeline of LD 2003 and especially not
the ADU components. Updating town zoning ordinances to comply with this law is 
simply not the herculean effort municipalities are suggesting; and certainly not as 
herculean as the accumulative efforts of thousands of people searching for a place to 
call home.
