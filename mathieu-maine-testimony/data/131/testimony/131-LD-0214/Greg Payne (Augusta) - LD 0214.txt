Senator Pierce , Representative Gere , and distinguished members of the Joint Select Committee 
on Housing , my name is Greg Payne,  and I serve as  the Senior Advisor on Housing  Policy  in the 
Governo r’s Office o f Policy Innovation and the Future. I am here today to offer testimony in 
opposition  to L.D. 214, L.D. 665, and L.D. 1154.  
 
The Mills Administration has made a strong commitment to addressing Maine’s housing supply 
constraints. I n her first days after taking office, Governor Mills  released a long -delayed $15 
million senior housing bond . The Governor subsequently signed into law  the creation of the 
Maine Affordable Housing Tax Credit program, the largest investment in affordable housing in 
Maine history, and  authorized the refinance of existing housing bonds to make available nearly 
$40 million in new housing development capital.  She also dedicated $50 million in funding from 
the Maine Jobs & Recovery Plan for the creation of new, affordable homes for Maine people.  
 
In addition to these historic investments in affordable housing development , last April Governor 
Mills signed L.D. 2003 into law. This landmark legislation aims to increase the supply  of 
housing units statewide  by removing restrictions on the property rights of  homeowners  and 
providing the private market with more opportunity  to feasibly add the housing stock that 
Mainers  need . The bill received bipartisan support in both legislative chambers  and will take 
effect on July  1, 2023.  LDs 214, 665 and  1154 would each either significantly scale back or add 
significant delays to the implementation of th is law. We oppose each of these proposals and 
remain committed to responding to Maine’s unprecedented housing crisis with urgency and 
action.  
 
Maine faces historically low rental vacancy rates and a median home sale price which jumped b y 
12 percent between 2021 and 2022.  Housing costs remain out of reach for far too many Maine 
people, because we lack the rental and ownership stock that we need. The  reasonable and 
thoughtful provisions contained within L.D. 2003 unlock  new ways for Mainer s to address the 
housing crunch , including  in their ow n backyards.  
 
We urge your opposition to these bills as written, which would either roll  back key provisions of 
L.D. 2003 or add unnecessarily long  delays to their implementation.  However, we understand the 
concerns that  some municipalities have about  timing, and welcome further discussion about  that 
issue . We are aware that additional legislative proposals are  likely to be referred to the 
Committee very soon, and would be open to conversation  with the Committee  and concerned

undercut the critical polic y changes  that led to L.D.  2003 ’s bipartisan passage through the 130th 
Legislature.  
 
Thank you for your c onsideration and I would be happy to answer any questions.
