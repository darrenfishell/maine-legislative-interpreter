The Town of Cape Elizabeth has an excellent comprehensive Plan worked on for 
years with citizen participation at all steps of completing the Plan/project. We do 
NOT want the state of Maine to dictate what our town can and cannot do. State 
legislators do not know our Cape issues and have no vested interest in what our local 
goals are and the state is not in the position to decide what should happen in Cape 
Elizabeth. LOCAL control not state mandates because the citizens care about and 
carry through on our town needs.
