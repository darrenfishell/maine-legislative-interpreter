Written Testimony for the public hearing on LD 214 on April 11, 2023 
Re: speaking in favor of LD 214
Dear Honorable Committee Members,
The law passed last year (LD 2003) does not make sense for small towns and 
especially small rural towns. Towns without on street parking, metered or unmetered. 
Towns without any or only a very limited municipal sewer, water system and public 
transportation systems.   Many of these smaller rural towns already provide a more 
affordable location to live with lower land values and real estate taxes. 
When it comes to housing issues one size does not fit all situations. The larger 
municipalities with substantial municipal sewer and water systems, curbing with 
painted and metered parking and other infrastructure which is conducive to intensive 
development are a very different case than small rural towns.  Small towns cannot 
afford amenities such as public bus transportation, municipal trash pickups, sewer 
systems, and water systems a large concentrated and densely populated municipality 
can afford. Year after year small towns struggle with a limited tax base to keep taxes 
down for their residents. And thus keep its small town feel while keeping its taxes 
affordable.   Many people seek out these towns with lower taxes and land values as a 
more affordable housing alternative.  I respectfully request you recommend passing 
this proposed law. 
Thank you for your consideration of my thoughts and comments.
Respectfully yours,
Jim
