Freeport
LD 214
I choose to reside in Freeport because it is a small town where residents get to be 
involved in the decision making process of local government. State government 
should not be allowed to pass legislation which applies a one size fits all approach and
circumvents or ignores local rules or guidelines established by local residents. I 
support LD214 because it allows small towns to continue to decide what makes sense 
for their small town, especially regarding land use and zoning.
