LD 214
I am a planning board member in the town of Fryeburg. We have had numerous 
discussions and meetings regarding LD 2003 over the past year. As a town we have 
paid lawyers to help us understand the law. Everyone is confused and unclear about 
the law, including the lawyers. Towns like ours do not have the resources to deal with
incorporating this law into our ordinance. It is frankly irresponsible of the legislature 
to impose this law across the board. The law itself is irresponsible. Among other 
unintended effects, the law will result is haphazardly built units in peoples' backyards.
It will be an embarrassment to architecture and planning. It will wreck the fabric and 
centuries-old land use patterns of our towns. Small towns, which often change at a 
snail's pace, will be wrecked architecturally. The benefits of this law will be largely 
wealthy developers and out-of-state speculators. There will be an increasing class 
divide between towns and neighborhoods that are able to mitigate this law and those 
that cannot. People of means will choose subdivisions and larger lots. It is astonishing
how poorly this law is thought out. If implemented, it will be noted by future 
stakeholders as a knee-jerk, amateur planning attempt by a group of devastatingly 
unqualified politicians that will have laid an irreparable road map of community, land 
use, and architectural upheaval.
