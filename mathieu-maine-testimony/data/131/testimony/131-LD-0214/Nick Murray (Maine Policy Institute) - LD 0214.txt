Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
214:
“An
Act
to
Amend
the
Laws
Regarding
Zoning
and
Land
Use
Restrictions
to
Limit
Certain
Requirements
to
Municipalities
with
a
Population
of
More
than
10,000”
Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Housing,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
214.
A
sweeping
housing
policy
bill
passed
last
session,
LD
2003,
imposed
certain
mandates
on
localities
related
to
accessory
dwelling
units,
affordable
housing
development,
and
local
zoning.
Some
of
these
mandates
are
dependent
on
whether
a
town
has
a
comprehensive
plan.
The
law
established
that
enforcement
of
these
mandates
would
begin
on
July
1,
2023.
LD
214
is
necessary
because
it
would
delay
the
enforcement
of
those
mandates
until
October
1.
It
is
prudent
because
it
would
also
distinguish
that
only
towns
“with
a
population
over
10,000”
would
be
subject
to
comply
with
LD
2003’s
requirements.
Many
voices
in
the
last
session,
including
ours,
questioned
the
wisdom
of
applying
the
mandates
in
LD
2003
to
all
towns,
no
matter
their
population.
Municipalities
will
be
on
the
hook
for
not
only
the
overt
requirements,
but
the
potential
unintended
consequences
of
LD
2003.
With
greatly
increased
housing
density,
many
towns
would
have
to
increase
funding
for
water
and
sewer
infrastructure,
school
systems,
and
everything
in
between.
Article
IX,
Section
21
of
the
Maine
State
Constitution
says
that
“the
State
may
not
require
a
local
unit
of
government
to
expand
or
modify
that
unit’s
activities
so
as
to
necessitate
additional
expenditures
from
local
revenues
unless
the
State
provides
annually
90%
of
the
funding
for
these
expenditures,”
and
notes
that
this
provision
“must
be
liberally
construed.”
1
Would
a
liberal
construction
of
this
passage
allow
the
technical
assistance
funding
currently
provided
in
the
bill
to
fulfill
the
state’s
constitutional
responsibility
to
fund
90%
of
the
cost
of
requiring
localities
to
“expand
or
modify”
their
activities?
In
reality,
the
LD
2003
mandates
are
not
necessary
for
the
vast
majority
of
towns.
The
oft-cited
housing
crisis
is
located
squarely
in
Southern
Maine,
as
a
report

It
told
us
that,
among
the
estimated
9,000
housing
units
that
the
state
is
currently
short
of,
according
to
demand,
more
than
8,000
of
them
are
in
the
US
Census’s
Portland-South
Portland
Metro
Statistical
Area,
made
up
of
York
and
Cumberland
counties.
The
region
has
about
540,000
residents,
or
40%
of
the
state’s
population,
living
in
nearly
227,000
households.
In
other
words,
90%
of
the
housing
problem
is
affecting
40%
of
the
population.
3
Therefore,
mandating
all
towns
follow
the
extensive
mandates
of
LD
2003
is
nonsensical
and
unlikely
to
solve
the
problem
before
causing
widespread
confusion
and
higher
costs
for
small
towns
across
the
state.
Broad
mandates
are
rarely,
if
ever,
the
best
policy
solution.
That
is
quite
evident
in
state
housing
policy.
Passage
of
LD
214
would
provide
smaller
towns
with
an
out,
and
other
localities
with
much-needed
breathing
room
to
figure
out
how
to
comply
with
the
coming
mandates.
Please
deem
it
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
provide
space
for
local
officials
and
residents
to
formulate
a
culture
of
growth
of
their
own
accord.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
