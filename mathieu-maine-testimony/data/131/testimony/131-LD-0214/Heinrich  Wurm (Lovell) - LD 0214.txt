Lovell
LD 214
Hello, 
I am a resident of Lovell in Oxford County and a member of the Planning Board and 
the Comprehensive Plan Review Committee. While I am aware of the housing 
shortage and applaud the legislature for its efforts to bring about changes, I do not 
believe LD2003 can be applied equally all across Maine's towns. I support LD214 as 
an effort to differentiate between larger municipalities and their potential from rural 
communities and their limitations. 
Thank you.
