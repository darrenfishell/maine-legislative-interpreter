Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and members af the Committee on 
Housing, my name is Peter Chabot and I Live in New GLoucester. I oppose this 
biLL because I bought and paid for my Land. I pay my taxes on time. I have 
3.2 acres. The towns requirements are 2 acres per residence. I stand before 
you today after getting cancer treatment in Scarborough with very LittLe 
time to spare to get here. You hoLd these meetings whiLe tax paying 
Americans are at work earning a Living to keep the Land that they purchased, 
and are not avaiLabLe to be at these hearings to stand up for themseLves. I 
have enough Land to buiLd 2 separate homes whiLe hoLding to aLL the setbacks 
required by the town, yet my Lack af .8 acres wiLL not aLLow for it by town 
standards. I pay my taxes and the town gets to decide what I can and can not 
do with my Land. It is wrong by every standard that we hoLd as free 
Americans. 
My intention is to buiLd a home for my parents so that they can come 
back to Maine and Live debt free as I do. I work 66-80 hours a week aLong 
with juggLing doctors appointments so that I can buiLd them a home and 
remain debt fee for aLL af us. That is the American dream and it gets shot 
down by a few peopLe in an affice deciding what we as tax payers are aLLowed 
to do with our property. I know others in New GLoucester that would Like to 
buiLd smaLL homes on their Land for their chiLdren because it is hard to 
find a decent pLace to rent that is affordabLe and passing any LegisLation 
that wouLd Limit what peopLe can do with their Land wouLd onLy hurt our 
future generations from having a good start in Life. I am aLL for zoning 
requirements because I do not want my neighbor to buiLd 5 houses on one acre 
and ruining our quiet neighborhood. I get that, but come on if I have aLL 
the proper setbacks needed wny shouLd the town have the right to deny me 
what I want to do with my Land? They didn't earn the money to buy it, they don't pay the taxes on it, but if I choose to not pay my taxes because they 
treat my Land as their own they wiLL just take it from me. It is my understanding that LD2003 was passed to increase affordabLe housing and make 
finding ptaces to Live easier. why are any biLLs that wouLd stop such a good 
thing for our communities being considered? I ask you today to not pass any 
LegisLation that would bLock LD2003 and stop tax paying Americans from using 
their Land as they wish. I speak for aLL who are at work right now with no 
cLue any of this is going on. Thank you for hearing me.
