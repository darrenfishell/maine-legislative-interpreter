LD 214
I support LD 214 “An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding Zoning and Land Use 
Restrictions to Limit Certain Requirements to Municipalities with a Population of 
More than 10,000”.
Some of us like to live in a small-town on purpose. We support the concept of “home 
rule” via our small town “town council”. The concept of “one size fits all, is not 
palatable to those of us who dislike state government/big government intrusion as 
how we run our town. And when this intrusion is to fulfill an agenda, hands off our 
home rule!
Again, I support LD 214 “An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding Zoning and Land 
Use Restrictions to Limit Certain Requirements to Municipalities with a Population of
More than 10,000”, and it ought to pass.
