LD 214
I am writing to urge you to vote in support of LD214 amending the zoning and land 
use regulations that were made law last year in LD2003.  The dictates from Augusta 
are unfair and how they are even Constitutional is a mystery to me.  LD 2003 was a 
state-mandated takeover of a municipality's ability to manage growth and a total 
overreach!  Please support and vote for LD214 to somewhat mitigate this overreach!
