LD 214
Please support LD 214, “An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding Zoning and Land Use
Restrictions to Limit Certain Requirements to Municipalities with a Population of 
More than 10,000.”   This bill, sponsored by Representative Richard Campbell, is in 
response to LD 2003, a federally sponsored and big lobbyist  promoted “Act To 
Implement the Recommendations of the Commission To Increase Housing 
Opportunities in Maine by Studying Zoning and Land Use Restrictions.” This bill, 
foisted onto the state of Maine in the last session, is totally inappropriate for our state.
Sponsor Senator Fecteau characterized LD 2003 as merely providing “a frame” for 
the varied patchwork quilt of our local municipal zoning ordinances. In reality it is a 
straightjacket that imposes a one-size-fits-all, Washington based mandate on Maine 
municipalities. There may be some justification for such a mandate in high density 
crowded metropolitan settings, but Maine is not Jersey City, Baltimore, or 
Westchester County, New York. The quest for affordable housing is no reason to 
transplant supposed cures for urban blight onto rural Maine. Please vote for LD 214 to
temper the local effects of LD 2003 on Maine municipalities.
