LD 214
Dear Senator Pierce, Representative Gere and distinguished members of the Joint 
Select Committee on Housing,
My name is Nat Jordan. I’m 23 and I’m from Cape Elizabeth.
I’d like to offer an update on what’s happening in town. Forced to deal with LD 2003,
a couple of loud voices have tried in vain to find a loophole in the bill. They’ve spent 
months trying and failing to convince town councilors of a difference between the 
term “multiplex” and “multifamily.” Since they can’t attack the state legislature in a 
town meeting, certain people have turned to disparaging the town planner. 
All this consternation means that LD 2003 is working. 
The suburbs are the ones that refuse to change their zoning. Cape Elizabeth might be 
the most guilty culprit. Greater Portland desperately needs affordable housing. Yet 
here in Cape Elizabeth, we haven’t built any significant affordable housing in 50+ 
years. Thanks to LD 2003, our ordinance committee just drafted zoning changes that 
encourage the construction of multifamily housing. 
To pass LD 214 would be to defeat the purpose of LD 2003. LD 214 would make 
more remote the chance that young people can buy a place in Cape Elizabeth. I urge 
you to continue the work you began last session to make Maine a more welcoming 
place. Young people like me want to put down roots here, we just need an affordable 
place to do so. 
Sincerely,
Nat Jordan
