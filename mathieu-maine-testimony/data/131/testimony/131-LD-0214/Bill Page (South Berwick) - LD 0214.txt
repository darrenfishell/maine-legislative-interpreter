Dear Madams & Sirs,
I respectfully submit my testimony in OPPOSITION of this Act on the grounds that it 
is discriminatory to those living in municipalities with populations of less than 
10,000.  
As a resident of South Berwick, based on the current language, we would NOT be 
able to proceed with the building of an accessory dwelling unit to our property for the 
purposes of providing housing for our elderly parents.  This limitation completely 
negates the intent of this initiative in well over 50% of York County Towns.  An area 
of Maine where housing is in great shortage! 
Population of the municipality should NOT be used in determining where in the State 
of Maine ADU's can be legally built.
Sincerely,
Bill Page,
South Berwick
