LD 214 testimony - 4/11/2023
To the Joint Select Committee on Housing,
My name is Andrew Brosnan, I am a resident of the Town of Lovell. I also serve as chair of the Lovell Planning Board. Lovell is a small rural town in Western Maine with a population of approximately 1,200. I am writing today to voice my support for LD 214, an act to exempt municipalities of less than 10,000 from certain provisions of LD 2003.
For tiny, rural towns such as Lovell, LD 2003 puts an undue burden on the town, from requiring broad, complex changes to existing zoning ordinances to potential unintended consequences such as requiring the creation, updating and expansion of many municipal services. Small, rural Maine towns simply do not have the resources for such things. Additionally, many provisions of LD 2003 are simply not necessary in sparsely developed, rural towns such as Lovell. Compared with more urban areas, available land for housing is abundant and density restrictions are not a factor holding back development of aﬀordable housing. In short, LD 2003 takes the problems faced by densely populated areas of Maine and forces a solution on the rest of the state. 
Maine is a great and diverse state. Maine’s cities are of great beneﬁt to the state - jobs, advances in science, medicine and technology, cultural centers and more. Our rural areas are also a treasure with lakes, streams, mountains and forests. LD 2003’s one size ﬁts all approach to planning simply does not work across the entire state. I urge you to recommend passage of LD 214.
Respectfully,
Andrew Brosnan
Lovell, Maine
