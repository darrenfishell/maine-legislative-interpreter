 I feel that the state legislature does not have the right to dictate how individual towns 
mange their zoning laws and regulations.  Local people should be able to determine 
what direction their town takes as far as housing density, open space and commercial 
development. Every county and community in the State of Maine needs to be 
evaluated individually.
