RE: LD 582, An Act to Enhance Certain Penalties for Possession of Firearms by Prohibited 
Persons  
 
DA: April 3 , 2023  
 
 
 The Criminal Law Advisory Commission (CLAC)* respectfully submits the following  
testimony in opposition to LD 582.   
 
 CLAC is not aware of information  indicating tha t sentences being imposed for  convictions 
under 15 M .R.S. § 393 are at the outside limits of the Class D and Class C sentences currently 
available under  this statute , or that judges  have indicated that their discretion is constrained by the 
current classification.    CLAC does not support increasing the classification and thus penalties  for 
crimes a bsent s ome sho wing that current penalties are insufficient.    
 
 
 
*CLAC  is an advisory body established by the Legislature.   17 -A M.R.S. §§ 1351 -1357.    It 
consists of 9 members appointed by the Attorney General.  Our current members include current 
defense attorneys, prosecutors, Maine  Bar Counsel , and a retired practition er with experience as 
defense counsel, prosecutor and in court administration.    In addition, three sitting judges and one 
retired practitioner, appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, and, by statute, 
the Co -Chairs of the Legislatur e’s Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, serve as 
consultants.  The Supreme Judicial Court’s Criminal Process Manager serves as liaison from the 
Court to CLAC.   CLAC advises the Legislature on matters relating to crimes in the Criminal Code 
and in other Titles, the Bail and Juvenile Codes, and with respect to other statutes related to criminal 
justice processes.
