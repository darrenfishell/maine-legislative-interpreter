LD 582
Dear Committee Members, 
I am David Lemoine, from Swan's Island.
I am asking you to oppose LD 582-An Act to Enhance Certain Penalties for 
Possession of Firearms by Prohibited Persons.  This bill would make many people 
who have never harmed anyone into felons if convicted. Two examples. 
 1. I do think we need to strengthen our borders, but I don't think those that are here 
outside of proper immigration should be felons simply for possessing a gun.  
 2. Marijuana is legal under Maine law, but not Federal. This would make it a State 
felony to have two separate things that are each considered legal in this State. I think 
at least this part of the bill should be tabled until Federally marijuana is legalized, or 
an exemption put in this bill.  I don't use it, but I know good people that do, and I 
don't think Maine would benefit from making those people felons.  
Thank you for your time.
