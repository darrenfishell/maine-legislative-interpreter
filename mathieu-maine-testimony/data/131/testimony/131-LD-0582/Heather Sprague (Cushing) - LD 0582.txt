LD 582
Dear distinguished members of the committee and Senators, my name is Heather 
Sprague and I live in Cushing. I write today in opposition to LD 582 an act to enhance
certain penalties for possession of firearms by prohibited persons because we already 
have strict penalties regarding possession of firearms by prohibited persons and any 
more penalties would be in direct violation of our second amendment rights to bear 
arms in the event we the people need to defend ourselves from an inept, desperate, 
communist government like we have here. I call it communist because of what was 
just done with the budget. It makes me think and be very concerned that this is an 
attempt to infringe on that right. In fact I oppose all the gun bills being heard today 
because they all infringe on our second amendment right. I strongly ask that you vote 
ought not pass to protect our constitutional rights and may I remind you that criminals
do not follow gun laws, its the person pulling the trigger that kills not the gun. Thank 
you for your time.
