LD 48
My name is Michael and I have owned and operated a medical cannabis business in 
Maine for almost 6 years.
The issue I would like to provide my personal thoughts and testimony on for LD48 is 
specifically regarding testing requirements.
1) Once testing requirements are fully agreed upon.
2) I think an independent, third-party testing facility(s) should be established by the 
state of Maine.
     a) An independent lab can help avoid much of the impropriety currently with some
of the existing labs (or at the very least appearance of it by a number of stakeholders)
     b) The cost of testing is a major concern, especially for small businesses, and I 
believe some of them have/will skirt testing requirements if it's not feasible cost wise. 
     c) This is where I suggest the independent Maine labs can help offset/subsidize the
testing costs, or provide a sliding scale depending on the size of the operation.
3) Finally, and this is where I try to bring it all togeteher.....is that the data collected 
by these labs on cannabis is incredibly VALUABLE. It's a cutting-edge industry, that 
is expanding world-wide, and I believe the University of Mississippi is the only US 
college currently studying. 
At some point (and I know there are many hurdles on the federal level and schools 
receiving funding, grants, etc.).....when the obstacles are out of the way....the valuable
data from these labs should be provided to the UNIVERSITY of MAINE.
4) Maine is on the forefront of cannabis on the East Coast. My testimony and 
suggestion is to figure out a way that subsidized testing of cannabis in Maine, and the 
collection of data and eventual collaboration) can one day put the University of Maine
system as the number one destination to study cannabis. A win-win.
Thank you for your time.
Very Truly Yours, 
Michael Dougrey
