Susan Meehan, Sweden, Maine, 207-861-1945 goldenwolf458@gmail.com
Good
morning
Chairperson
Hickman
and
Chairperson
Supica
and
honorable
members
of
the
Veterans
and
Legal
Affairs
Committee.
My
name
is
Susan
Meehan,
and
I
am
a
registered
caregiver
in
Maine,
and
I
am
a
Board
member
of
the
Maine
Cannabis
Coalition
and
a
member
of
the
Cannabis
Council
of
Maine.
I
moved
from
Connecticut
to
Maine
to
access
Maine’s
medical
cannabis
to
treat
my
daughter’s
devastating
Dravet
Syndrome
epilepsy
in
2013.
Cannabis
brought
Cyndimae
from
her
deathbed
in
nearly
constant
seizures
and
from
a
wheelchair
to
a
happy,
running,
playing
child
who
loved
the
cold
water
rapids
of
Maine
and
the
snow
covered
hills
and
the
many
playgrounds.
Cyndimae
passed
away
from
*SUDEP
while
sleeping
on
her
daddy’s
chest here in Augusta, Maine on March 13, 2016.
I
testify
neither
for
nor
against
LD
48
as
it
lands
in
Maine’s
Adult
Use,
and
I
generally
“work”
in
Maine
Medical;
however,
normalizing
this
plant
and
normalizing
people
managing
their
own
medicine
and
normalizing
body
autonomy
is
an
important
part
of
protecting
access
to
this
plant.
Had
every
neighbor
had
a
garden
when
our
Cyndimae
struggled
to
find
strains
comparable
to
those
destroyed
by
police
in
Connecticut
in
2013,
maybe
we
would
still
be
graced
by
Cyndimae’s
physical
presence.
We
found
amazing
medicine
in
Maine,
but
nothing
stopped her seizures like the one strain we lucked upon in Connecticut at the end of 2012.
I
find
it
ridiculous
that
we
debate
in
our
legislature
cartoon
characters,
geometric
shapes,
mythical
creatures
and
the
like.
Have
you
walked
through
an
alcohol
aisle
in
the
grocery
store?
There
are
mooses,
dragons,
people,
and
just
about
everything
up
for
debate
in
this
bill.
I
laugh
at
the
Maine
lottery
minivan
in
the
parking
lot
at
19
Union
Street
every
time
–
it
is
so
appealing
to
children
with
all
its
colorful
balls
littering
its
bright
and
shiny
surface.
Is
gambling
okay
to
appeal
to
children?
Have
you
witnessed
a
wrapped
delivery
truck
advertising
Budweiser
driving
down
Maine’s
roads?
As
a
society,
we
embrace
our
alcohol,
a
poison
that
has
led
more
people
to
their
deaths
than
perhaps
any
other
drug.
I
partake
–
I
am
not
asking
that
we
prohibit
alcohol
–
your
body,
your
choice.
I
am
asking
that
we
please
put
an
end
to
this
nonsense
of
not
allowing
cannabis
businesses
to
advertise
in
both
Adult
Use
and
Medical.
Let
parents
do
the
parenting,
and
yes
please
keep
laws
in
place
to
discourage
our
youth
from
abusing
these
substances
and
activities,
but
there
is
not
a
completely
comprehensive
list
of
cans
and
cannots.
Something
will
be
amiss
and
someone
will
find
it.
The
stigma
created
in 1930’s America continues to hamper access to this plant.
As
for
testing,
I
just
hope
that
it
is
sensible
and
meaningful.
We
can
lock
up
the
supply
chain
as
Oregon
has
done
and
people
will
turn
to
the
illicit
market.
The
only
meaningful
testing
is
spot
check
audits
and
random
spot
checks
by
OCP
(or
other?)
that
will
test
for
pesticides
and
perhaps
aspergillus
mold.
We
have
no
data
on
pesticides
in
combusted
and
inhaled
plant
matter,
but
consumers
should
be
informed.
While
I
would
choose
a
more
expensive
and
pesticide
free
option,
many
consumers
even
in
the
grocery
store
do
not
care.
Please
be
reasonable.
Let
parents
parent,
doctors
medicate
and
legislators
legislate.
Children
are
going
to
see
and
witness
things
their
parents
do
not
agree
with,
and
it
is
up
to
the
parents
to
have
those
conversations
with
children
who
do
not
live
in
an
isolated
bubble
but
in
a
society
full
of
diversity
and
different
viewpoints.
I
hope
both
programs
can
be
affected
by
sensible
and
reasonable
and
less
subjective
depending
on
the
inspector
of
the
day
guidelines.
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
