LD 48 Testimony 1.30.23  Good morning, Chair Hickman, Chair Supica and esteemed members of the VLA committee.  My name is Brett Messer.  I’m the owner and operator of Brigid Farm located in Saco.  As I shared with you guys’ last week, I am in the final semester of my Medical Cannabis Science Master’s Degree at the University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy.   I tried to cram a bit too much for last week’s testimony, so I’ll keep it shorter and sweeter this week.  And I will follow up with additional information via written testimony.   The lab testing issue before you today is rather simple.  The scientific community has very different standards for analytical testing methodology in Cannabis than the Maine State Law.  The understood variance is 20%, double our current state standard.  I have attached two scientific journal articles which identify and confirm this statement.    Additionally, we have another major issue.  Testing labs in Maine regularly report wildly varying results.  This is largely due in part to not having standardized equipment and protocol for cannabis analytics.  I did a study by submitting the same sample, to three labs, and I submitted the same sample to each lab twice.  Not only were there greater than 10% variance between labs, but there were also instances of 10% variance at the same lab with the same sample.  I have attached all the lab reports and a graph summarizing the study.  This shouldn’t be decided based on the opinion of a business owner or lobbyist, the scientific community is already in agreement based on the currently available data.  On to packaging; let’s start with some facts.   In 2019 the State of Maine had 145 alcohol related deaths, of those 42 were related to drunk driving, and 5 of those individuals were under the age of 21.  22% of Maine youth’s aged 12 to 20 self-reported the use of alcohol which places Maine among the highest in the nation.  This rate is currently rising year by year.  In contrast the self-reported rate of teen cannabis use is 9%.  That number is in decline both here in Maine and nationwide as the conversation around cannabis changes.  Additionally, there have been no reported cannabis related deaths in Maine since medical cannabis was first legalized in 1999, with nearly 3000 alcohol related deaths during that time.   So, this begs the question.  Why do we seek regulate Cannabis to a higher degree than alcohol.  Take a walk down the aisle of local Hannaford and take in the beer packaging.  It’s color, its artistic, its attractive among its competitors.    
We seek to achieve the same within cannabis marketing.  Our marketing efforts are already severely limited, and therefore we wish to make our products stand out on the shelf in stores, which already have age restricted entry requirements.   The Human, Animal and Fruit logo provision needs to be eliminated entirely, not modified.  There is no data that supports this keeps cannabis out of the hands of children.  The proposed changes make this part of the law even more vague and ambiguous than it is currently.  The last thing we need in our cannabis laws is ambiguity, because as is, inspectors are notoriously known for interpreting things the way they see fit, which in my experience is usually not correct or a gross overstep of authority.  Quite frankly, I think this is yet another play from the corporate, multi state cannabis operators to stimy their competition as they realize their large marketing teams still can’t connect with consumers.   At my company we employ talented local artists to create packages that are attractive and stand out to consumers, much like the beer industry.  Our average consumer at my business is 36 years old.  We’ve never sought to create packaging attractive to children, though some of our packaging would be in violation of this proposed law.  We make packaging that is attractive to adults.  It’s not possible to eliminate the possibility of someone under 18 being attracted to that package.  Let’s use Apple computers for example.  They use a fruit.  They use a cartoon style logo.  Their core customer is not a child, its 25 to 34 years old, much like cannabis.  It’s absolutely silly that we are even wasting lawmakers time with any conversation other than eliminating this phrasing from the law entirely.   Thank you,  Brett Messer

ABSTRACT
Owing to the lack of federal oversight of recreational and medical cannabis in the United States, apatchwork of regulatory guidelines exists for compliance testing. Adding to this complexity is the
fact that Canadian cannabis regulations differ from those in any of the state mandated regulatory
jurisdictions and, at the time of writing, cannabis was only recently legalized in Mexico. Therefore,
from a North American perspective, cannabis testing represents a significant regulatory landscapeto navigate. This not only makes things confusing for those involved in cannabis production and
processing, it also creates challenges for those in the analytical testing world when they have to
understand and develop methods to be compliant with these various regulatory jurisdictions. In
this review article, the current state of analytical chemistry knowledge for cannabis compliance
testing is summarized, with an emphasis on suitable techniques and some common problems toavoid. This includes summaries of analytical methods for potency, terpenes, pesticides, mycotoxins,
residual solvents, heavy metals and microbiology.

Introduction
Widely known and studied, Cannabis sativa L. (cannabis)
produces a class of secondary metabolites called phytocanna-
binoids (heretofore referred to simply as cannabinoids);
terpenophenolic compounds that are concentrated in aresinous secretion produced in the glandular trichomes ofcannabis.
[1]While only a handful of cannabinoids have been
objectively characterized for their biological activity, morethan 100 cannabinoid variants have been identified in can-nabis.
[2]Though used for its medicinal properties for hun-
dreds of years, the characterization of the cannabinoidsfound in cannabis (and hemp) has been a focus of law

enforcement for decades, as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
has been classified as a Schedule 1 substance under the
United States Controlled Substances Act since 1970. More
recently, the US effectively legalized hemp, defined as having“the plant Cannabis sativa Linnaeus …with a delta-9 tetra-
hydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent
on a dry weight basis. ”in the Agriculture Improvement Act
of 2018, commonly referred to as the Farm Bill.
[3]Similar
measures for hemp have been adopted by the European
Union.[4]Meanwhile, the move to legalize cannabis con-
sumption, for medical and/or recreational use in manyNorth American regulatory jurisdictions has spurredresearch and development pertaining to cannabis. It has also
lead to a burgeoning analytical testing landscape to support
consumer safety and regulatory compliance.
Included in the various regulatory frameworks are
requirements to test cannabis and cannabis-derived productsfor endogenous metabolites and exogenous contaminants.Paramount among the endogenous metabolites included inlegislation are cannabinoids, and in some regulations, ter-penes. For exogenous contaminants, all jurisdictions man-date testing for residual solvents (in derivative products),pesticides, mycotoxins, heavy metals and microbial contami-nants. The particulars of these testing requirements changeas a function of regulatory jurisdiction.
Due to its nascent status and heterogeneous regulatory
requirements, the analytical testing infrastructure to supportcannabis testing is evolving. This makes things confusing forthose involved in cannabis production and processing andcreates challenges for those in the analytical testing worldwhen they have to understand and develop methods to becompliant with various (and evolving) regulatory require-ments. In this review article, the current state of analyticalchemistry in support of cannabis compliance testing is dis-
cussed. This includes thorough evaluations and commentary
on published methods for potency, terpenes, pesticides, myco-toxins, residual solvents, heavy metals and microbiology.
Potency
There is a growing interest in cannabinoids beyond THCand (cannabidiol) CBD, led currently by d8-THC. As a
result, it has become increasingly important to implementmethods for the quantitative measurement of cannabinoidsin a variety of matrices. This includes so-called potency test-ing, defined here as the quantitation of THC, CBD, theirrespective acidic forms (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid[THCA] and cannabidiolic acid [CBDA]) and cannabinol(CBN), as well as the quantitation of more complex canna-binoid profiles ( vide infra ). The discussion herein on the
quantitation of cannabinoids is a distinct analytical processfrom determining total THC on a dry weight basis. Forviewpoints on dry weight determination, a critical aspect ofhemp and cannabis legislation, we refer the reader to thework currently being done by the ASTM InternationalCommittee D37 and the Cannabis Analytical ScienceProgram (CASP) coordinated by AOAC International.Sample preparation for cannabinoid quantitation has
recently gained focus as new methods and matrices reach
the consumer marketplace. Traditionally, cannabis oil and
flower samples used liquid-liquid and liquid-solid extractionprocedures, respectively. The solvent systems have evolvedfrom methanol/chloroform extractions,
[1,5]most recently
replaced by similar performing methanol/water or aceto-
nitrile/methanol procedures to reduce the health risks forlaboratory personnel when using chloroform.
[5–7]Sampling
and homogenization of plant materials is also a critical fac-
tor, especially for heterogenous materials like cannabis
flower and concentrates. While sonication is the most com-mon and supported technique,
[8]a thorough understanding
of sampling procedures and homogeneity should underpinall cannabis compliance testing programs.
[9]As more matri-
ces containing cannabinoids enter the marketplace (e.g., pet
food, shampoo, bath bombs, cereal, etc.), there may be anevolving need for modified extraction procedures. Forexample, recent publications have focused on edible matrices
like chocolates, where matrix effects have been shown to
have an important impact on method accuracy.
[10]Modified
extraction procedures will have a measurable impact onmethod performance for such challenging matrices.
[11]
The quantitative analysis of cannabinoids may by per-
formed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)and gas chromatography (GC) for analytical separation prior
to detection, but their comparative suitability is a widely dis-
cussed topic.
[1,4,9,12–14]Early focus of analytical analyses
were related to the legality and criminalization of cannabis,led by forensic chemistry. Therefore, the focus was on thetotal THC content of a sample, defined as the sum of THC
and THCA. Since GC relies on the thermal volatilization of
samples during injection, it converts THC into THCA.However, determining total THC in this way requires theacidic cannabinoids to undergo quantitative and reproducible
thermal decarboxylation in the GC.
[12]The degree of
decarboxylation during GC analysis depends on many fac-tors including, but not limited to, inlet and oven tempera-tures, injection volume and diluents.
[13]This typically makes
it difficult to accurately quantitate THC and CBD using GC,
let alone the quantitation of complex cannabinoid profiles.[1]
A systemic analysis of cannabinoid decarboxylation during
GC analysis has, to the authors knowledge, not been pub-
lished. Derivatization, usually in the form of trimethylsily-
ated compounds,[13]can be used to stabilize acidic
cannabinoids for GC analysis, but in a modern fee-for-ser-vice cannabis testing environment, the added material and
labor costs associated with derivatization limit their adop-
tion when throughput and testing costs are primary marketdrivers for cannabinoid quantitation.
Recently, HPLC and ultra-high pressure liquid chroma-
tography (UHPLC)
[15]have been implemented in laborato-
ries in order to provide faster analysis times and additionalinformation to the market. Complex profiling of the acidicand neutral cannabinoids can provide important informa-
tion about the status of the plant material, including harvest
maturity and storage conditions that could be valuable tomanufacturers and cultivators.
[13]While potency assays404 S. GOLDMAN ET AL.
typically have 5 –11 target cannabinoids, more cannabinoids
of interest and importance, biologically and economically,
are being added to cannabinoid profiling analyses.[5,16]The
addition of more cannabinoids is currently limited by theavailability of analytical standards, which at the time ofwriting includes 24 analytes. The stability of mixed calibra-
tion standards should be monitored, as examples of signifi-
cant changes in cannabinoid concentration at roomtemperature have been reported.
[6]There are many pub-
lished HPLC potency methods, with the vast majority of
them using conventional C18 reversed phase column
chemistry.[12]Both methanol and acetonitrile can be used
as organic modifiers, yielding different retention factorsdue to elutropic strength and possibly divergent selectivitydepending on the column phase.
[17]It is clear from the lit-
erature that in order to achieve robust HPLC analyses with
consistent chromatographic retention time, peak shape andresolution, precise pH and temperature control arerequired.
[5,6,13]Buffer concentration and pH are especially
important, as most methods prefer a pH /C243.3 and many
of the acidic cannabinoids have a pK a/C243.4,[13]leading to
the potential for peak shape and RT shifting since a givenacidic cannabinoid will exist in solution in different charge
states close to its pK
a.
Most published methods[1,4,6,7,13,14]use optical detection,
typically photodiode arrays (PDAs), due to their ease of use
and relatively low cost of operation. Additionally, PDAs can
provide UV spectra for identification and peak purity infor-mation.
[13]However, optical detection has some limitations
in specificity, as many cannabinoids are structurally similar,and thus have similar UV spectra. While chromatography is
able to address many interference challenges with optical
detection, there are many examples of cannabinoids and/orother interferences co-eluting, causing problems in identifi-cation and quantification.
[18]Such considerations become
more important as the panel of cannabinoids is expanded
and the number of matrices are increased, as the potentialfor chromatographic interferences increases. This is espe-cially true when quantitating lower concentration cannabi-
noids like cannabigerol (CBG) or tetrahydrocannabivarin
(THCV), where the relative impact of chromatographicinterferences on quantitative accuracy would be higher.Recent publications are utilizing the advantages of mass
spectrometry (MS) in series with liquid chromatography to
overcome these challenges.
[5]LC-MS methods come with
selectivity advantages via the added dimension of mass-to-charge analysis and product ion ratios (i.e., multiple reaction
monitoring [MRM]). Even in single-ion-monitoring (SIM)
experiments, many selectivity challenges posed by interfer-ences can be reduced or eliminated.
[18]
LC-MS methodologies, however, have their own limitations.
The largest of these being the cost increase and added labora-
tory expertise required for successful implementation of LC-MS methods.
[6]Since cannabinoids like D8-THC, D9-THC,
exo- T H C ,C B D ,C B C ,a n dC B La r es t r u c t u r a li s o m e r s( i . e . ,i s o -
baric), MS detection still requires chromatographic resolution,
as these compounds all have the same mass-to-charge ratioand their product ion spectra are, for practical purposes,indistinguishable. Although, in general LC-MS methods are
faster, despite the required isomer resolution since mass-resolved analytes typically can co-elute without negativelyimpacting method performance. Another MS-based method
that could help overcome isomeric separation limitations is ion
mobility. While not extensively explored, there is evidence thation mobility can successfully differentiate THC and CBD.
[19]
Terpenes
Second to cannabinoids as the dominant (by weight percent)
secondary metabolite produced by cannabis, terpenes may
constitute 0.5 –5% w/w of the inflorescence.[9,20]Terpenes
are classified according to the repeating number of five-carbon isoprene units used for their biosynthesis: mono- (2),sesqui- (3), di- (4) and triterpenoids (5).
[21]While the term
terpene includes compounds that are simple hydrocarbons
(e.g., pinene) and terpenoids refers to compounds contain-
ing heteroatoms (e.g., linalool), it is common practice to use“terpenes ”more generically to refer to this family of second-
ary metabolites. This nomenclature convention is usedherein. To date more than 200 terpenes have been identifiedin cannabis, but the 58 monoterpenes and 38 sequiterpenes
confirmed represent the compound classes found in the
greatest frequency and abundance.
[8]Parsing down these
exhaustive lists further, cannabis chemotypes are generallydominated by a subset of 10 –20 highly prevalent and highly
abundant terpenes, with the most studied and frequentlyobserved being b-myrcene, d-limonene, a-terpineol, c-terpi-
nolene, a/b-pinene, linalool, b-caryophyllene (the most
abundant sesquiterpene), a-humulene and caryophyllene
oxide (the chemical that narcotics control dogs smell whensearching for cannabis
[8]).[9,22]
Beyond their natural functions in plants (pest defense,
etc.), terpenes represent the dominant organoleptic contribu-tors to cannabis —it is these compounds that drive consumer
preference for certain types of cannabis due to their distinctaroma and flavor profiles. Savvy cannabis brands have rec-
ognized this as an opportunity to curate a diverse product
portfolio with consistent sensory attributes, that is high-lighted not just by cannabinoid profiles and concentrations,but also terpene profiles and their relative concentrations.Notwithstanding their importance to consumer preference,it is their potential synergy with cannabinoids (and other
secondary metabolites in cannabis) to elicit an “entourage ”
biological effect
[21]that underscores their importance to the
collective scientific understanding of cannabis. For example,while only a few terpenes have been adequately studied fortheir biological effects, pinene has been reported to aidmemory, which may counteract some of the effects of THC,
andb-caryophyllene interacts with the endocannabinoid sys-
tem and may be responsible for some of the anti-inflamma-tory effects of cannabis.
[22]Further, it has been proposed
that terpene profiles, while highly influenced by environ-mental conditions during plant maturation,
[23]could be
leveraged to aid in the classification of cannabis chemotypes
beyond the typical high THC and high CBD designations.[9]
The need for accurate and precise quantitation of terpenes,JOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES 405
therefore, is driven by consumer preference, their potential
biological impact and also the potential to aid in the classifi-
cation of cannabis. As more is discovered about the bio-
logical impact of terpenes in cannabis products, it is alsopossible that policies similar to some states, where terpenequantitation is part of regulatory compliance testing, will be
more widely adopted.
Sample preparation for terpene analysis is divided into
two categories: alkane-based solid-liquid extraction (SLE)and headspace-based (HS) techniques. To date, the most
prevalent approach for the analysis of terpenes in cannabis
(and indeed, in other plants and derivative products) hasbeen SLE using a hydrocarbon solvent, typically pentane,hexane or ether.
[22–28]The one exception to this was the
recent work of Ibrahim et al., who found that ethyl acetate
provided the highest extraction efficiency.[29]SLE is favored
due to its scalability for throughput and the fact that it issimple and cost-effective. While it is generally assumed that
quantitative extraction of terpenes is achieved with this
approach, the dearth of certified reference materials (CRMs)for terpenes in cannabis and derivative products makes thisassertion a challenge to validate. The principal drawback of
SLE for terpene analysis is the fact that it is nonselective, so
co-extracted matrix components that are not compatiblewith a given analytical technique can limit throughput capa-bilities due to an increased need for instrument maintenance
(e.g., the GC inlet will become dirtier more readily than
with more selective sample preparation techniques).
Several recent studies have eschewed SLE in favor of
static HS
[20,29]or HS solid-phase microextraction (HS-
SPME).[26]These techniques have the advantage of only
sampling volatile constituents in the sample matrix, so foul-ing of analytical instrumentation is minimized. HS-SPMEtakes this a step further and only samples volatile analytes
that adsorb to a chosen stationary phase. Recent reports of
bias in terms of the terpenes that adsorb to the SPMEfiber
[26,30]suggest that there are still method parameters to
be evaluated with this approach before it could see wide
adoption in a compliance testing environment. Moreover,
SPME is frequently used as a preconcentration step. For ter-penes, this is not necessary based on their concentrations incannabis and could actually lead to instances of column
overloading and/or detector saturation. These problems are
potentially exacerbated in cannabis, as it can be a challengeto tell, a priori , what an appropriate sample size would be
given the variability in terpene profiles and concentrations
in cannabis. Static HS, on the other hand, will sample all
analytes in an equilibrated gas phase, but may experience asampling bias for high boiling terpenes, as such compoundsmay not have sufficient equilibrium partial pressures, espe-cially in matrix. Nguyen et al. overcame this by using high-
temperature HS sampling (180
/C14C) to force higher boiling
terpenes (e.g., guaiol and a-bisabolol) into the gas phase.[26]
This approach was utilized to successfully pass a terpene
proficiency testing sample, indicating that acceptable bias for
higher boiling terpenes was attained. It should be noted
though, that not all HS autosamplers are capable of suchhigh temperature incubations, nor do all laboratories haveSPME hardware, so these techniques would not necessarily
be accessible to a wide swath of compliance testinglaboratories.
Another approach to reduce bias based on boiling point
is to use a technique called full evaporative technique (FET)HS sampling. In this approach, a small quantity of sample isused to ensure complete evaporation into the gas phase.This low sample quantity facilities a full transfer to the gas
phase due to an overall reduced partial pressure from other
volatile analytes present in the sample (and diluent, etc.). Atthe same time, it eliminates disparity in gas phase equilibriafor matrix samples in relation to solvent calibrators.
[30]
Shapira et al. successfully used this approach to quantitate
93 terpenes in cannabis.[31]However, the impact of small
sample sizes relative to sample homogeneity and representa-tive sampling need to be considered when using FET. Forexample, Shapira, et al only used 5 mg of solid sample or
10mL of standard for their analyses. The potential for sam-
pling bias and variability with such small sample quantities
need to be systematically verified before FET methods aretaken through method validation.
Chromatographic separation and detection of terpenes
has historically been done using GC-FID,
[23,24,27]a cost-
effective detector with excellent dynamic range and a
response that is directly proportional to carbon number(amenable to the analysis of hydrocarbon-based analytes liketerpenes). However, with fee-for-service terpene panels of30–40 analytes being the norm,
[27–29]and the fact that 93
have been reported in other methods2and more than 200
identified overall,[8]the potential for chromatographic inter-
ferences with a nonspecific detector technology like FID ishigh.
[20,28]For this reason, more current methods have
focused on GC-MS[20,22,25,26]and GC-MS/MS,[28,29]both of
which have improved selectivity in comparison to FID. But
MS is not always the final solution to selectivity challenges
for terpenes. This is due to the number of terpene isomersthat can be present in a given sample and the high energynature of electron impact (EI) ionization used for GC-MSanalyses. These high energy reactions break the terpenes
down to fragments that are generally shared within a given
class and will also be shared for structural isomers. Forexample, pinene and myrcene are structural isomers (bothhave a formula of C
10H16) and will have the same EI mass
spectra, so they need to be chromatographically resolved. Toprovide an additional level of confirmation in terpene iden-
tification, especially in the absence of analytical standards,
many methods use retention indexing (e.g., Kovats) in tan-dem with EI mass spectral matching.
[20,22,23,26]An alternate
approach, while seemingly more academic at present, is theuse of cold EI,
[25]which is analogous to chemical ionization
for GC in that it provides a more stable molecular ion to
aid compound identification.
A final point worth mentioning, is that all terpene analy-
ses discussed thus far will report a sum of enantiomers pre-sent in a given sample, as conventional chromatographic
columns do not resolve stereoisomers. This is an area of
research that is likely to get more attention as the biologicalimpact of new terpenes are investigated, especially since it is406 S. GOLDMAN ET AL.
known that enantiomers can elicit disparate biological effects
(e.g., a/b-pinene have different perceived odors). Moreover,
a proof-of-concept using terpene enantiomer profiles for
product authenticity testing has been reported,[6] which is
consistent with other terpene-rich products like tea tree oilwhere enantiomers have been used for geographiccharacterization.
[32]
Pesticides
Pesticides are compounds manufactured with the intent of
destroying insects or microorganisms that are harmful toplants. Pesticides are typically categorized based on theirclass of use or chemical class. The seven classes of use
include insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides,
acaricides, molluscicides, and nematocides.
[33]Pesticides can
also be divided by their chemical structures, with organo-phosphorus compounds, carbamates, chlorinated hydrocar-bons, pyrethroids, and heterocyclic compounds being the
dominant groups. The Federal Insecticide Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947 requires pesticide registra-tion for specific uses and establishes labeling requirementsfor these pesticides.
[34]In the US, prior to its use, a pesticide
must first be granted a residue tolerance or receive a toler-
ance exemption from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). Allowed uses for pesticides must besupported by data including toxicological, environmentalfate, and lifecycle analyses. Given the federal status of canna-
bis as a Schedule 1 drug, none of these processes used for
other plant commodities have been initiated and very littleis known about best practices of pesticide application anduse in cannabis cultivation.
[35]While hemp has been effect-
ively legalized in the US ( vide supra ), it too has the same
lack of codified knowledge regarding best practices for pesti-
cide application. As a result, most maximum residue limits(MRLs; often in the low part-per-billion range) are not dueto toxicity studies or risk management, but often are based
on the ability of laboratories to achieve them
analytically.
[36,37]
Pesticides are typically applied as a foliar spray during
cannabis cultivation and their residues may remain with
harvested flowers after cultivation. Interestingly, pesticideuse may not even be beneficial for the cannabis plant, ren-dering their use a risk introduced during cultivation.
[38]
Even if pesticides are not applied directly to the plant
though, they could still be introduced through the use ofsoil or irrigation sources contaminated with pesticides. If thecannabis inflorescence is further processed into cannabisoils, concentrates, or infused products, these pesticide resi-
dues could be concentrated, removed altogether, or chem-
ically transformed depending on which manufacturingprocesses are utilized. Pesticide residues can also be alteredafter application due to photo oxidation, biological degrad-
ation (within the plant, or due to soil microbes, etc.), or
volatilization
[39]leading to variable concentrations through-
out the cultivation and manufacturing processes.
Many of the pesticides found in cannabis and hemp sam-
ples are deemed moderately hazardous by the World HealthOrganization[33]and most of the documented toxic effects
of pesticides are based on dermal contact. Cannabis, how-ever, is frequently inhaled and there is scarce toxicological
research on the fate of pesticides and pesticide metabolites
during and after inhalational exposure. Some studies havemeasured the pesticide levels in mainstream smoke from10% to 70% of the initial concentration on the flower.
[40]
While there is data on pesticide inhalation from cigarette
smokers, cannabis users typically inhale up to two-thirds
larger puffs by volume and hold the puff for much longerthan cigarette smokers.
[33]This indicates that pesticide
exposure data from cigarettes may not correlate to cannabisusers. As well, during pregnancy, the placenta and fetalbrain are potential targets for both cannabinoids and
organophosphate pesticides.
[41]This is worrisome given that
estimates from the Colorado Department of Public Healthand Environment found 8.2% of new mothers had used can-nabis shortly before their pregnancy. These data suggest thatthe risks of pesticides in cannabis and derivative products
need to be better understood. One way to support this effort
is the development of accurate quantitative methodsfor pesticides.
Cannabis products are also much more diverse than
those offered by the tobacco or alcohol industries. Flowers
are inhaled; oils and concentrates are dabbed at high tem-
peratures or used in vaporizer cartridges and made intonumerous infused products, beverages, topicals, and edibles.Most coil-based vaporizer cartridges can be operated at vari-able battery settings leading to vaporization temperatures
ranging from 212 degrees F to 630 degrees F, depending on
the degree of wick wetting.
[42]This large temperature
range covers pyrolysis temperatures and can lead to thermo-oxidative degradation of many pesticides and can yield toxicby-products. One of the most famous by-products is hydro-gen cyanide, formed from the pyrolysis of the pesticide
myclobutanil.
[43]
The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) lists 561 com-
pounds (including 108 pesticides) that consumable cropsshould be tested for, the National Organic Program (NOP)
2611-1 lists 188 residues, and the United States FDA lists
over 750 pesticide residues in their compliance tests.
[44]
Given the high number of analytes, the lack of federal guid-
ance on which residues to look for and the lack of any toxi-cological and environmental data, states are left with littleguidance on how to figure out how to regulate pesticide use
on cannabis on their own. Providing some guidance is a
2013 release by the American Herbal Pharmacopeia thatincluded pesticides that were most likely to be used on can-nabis and highlighted acaricides, insecticides, fungicides andplant growth regulators.
[45]This document has helped some
states begin to regulate pesticides, but variation between
regulatory jurisdictions is the norm, rather than the excep-tion. For example, California have mandated pesticide test-ing for 66 pesticides,
[46]Oregon has 58 on their list,[47]
Colorado has only 15 on their list, while Canada mandates
testing for 96 pesticides.[37]
Beyond the challenges of inconsistent regulations, sample
preparation is another area of concern for pesticide analysis.JOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES 407
The cannabis flower matrix is heterogeneous and includes
over 550 compounds, many of which are capable of interact-
ing[48]—flavonoids, fatty acids, phenols, phytosterols, alco-
hols, ketones, and lactones can all interfere with variousextraction strategies and introduce ion suppression and ion
enhancements when using MS for analyte detection.
Common techniques include liquid-liquid extraction (LLE),solid-liquid extraction (SLE), solid-phase extraction (SPE),solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and quick, easy, cheap,
effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extractions. LLE
and/or SLE are quick and easy, but they are nonspecific,include high levels of solvent consumption and can require
significant dilution schemes prior to injection to mitigate
matrix effects. SPE uses less solvent, but is more laboriousand can be costly depending on the SPE phase selected.
SPME is a solvent free technique that is typically used only
in GC analyses, limiting its usefulness in analyzing broadpesticide panels. Although, when its use is appropriate,SPME reduces background interferences that may have been
present in LLE or SLE approaches. QuEChERS is a popular
technique, appearing in a significant amount of the literatureon pesticide quantitation in cannabis flower and derivative
products. Given the many variables in using QuEChERS,
this technique needs to be validated based on the type ofsalt, buffer, and organic/water phases used, as the chemis-
tries of the pesticide panel under investigation will impact
method recoveries (e.g., PSA will reduce the recovery ofacidic pesticides and GCB will do the same for planar pesti-cides). A study investigating the effects of buffers on the
QuEChERS preparation proved no clear trend in extraction
efficiencies and recoveries across the three methods.
[49]
Another issue with QuEChERS is the fact that the organic
solvents will also extract many hydrophobic compounds,
like cannabinoids. Since the concentration differencebetween cannabinoids and pesticides in a given sample will
likely be large, even with heavy dilution prior to analysis,
the cannabinoids can present chromatographic interferencesthat are challenging to overcome. Indeed, while such inter-ferences can frequently be addressed by the selectivity
afforded by tandem mass-spectrometry analyses, this
approach is not always successful. In some instances, it mayrequire altered sample preparation and/or chromatography
to remove such interferences. Therefore QuEChERS may
not be the method of choice for some laboratories.
Given the variability in the physical and chemical proper-
ties of pesticides (polarity, solubility, thermal lability, pK
a,
etc.), as well as the variability in maximum residue limits(MRLs) by regulatory jurisdiction, different technologies areutilized to quantitate pesticide residues. Since many pesticide
MRLs are in the low part-per-billion range, most peer-
reviewed articles have focused on LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS to quantitate these residues in cannabis and derivative
products. GC is sensitive and selective for hydrophobic and
volatile pesticides, but struggles with polar or thermallylabile compounds. LC-MS/MS, excels at the analysis of polar
and ionic compounds.
[50]Such capital expenditures must be
carefully considered, with financial capacity and testingneeds influencing which instrumentation to purchase. Onestudy from 2021 used LC-MS/MS to measure 82 of the 96
pesticide residues required by Health Canada.
[36]This
method shows how difficult pesticide testing can be when
regulatory requirements need to be met. Fourteen pesticides
were not able to meet Canadian requirements (seven weredetectable but not quantifiable and the other seven were notdetectable using ESI). A 2018 paper from Health Canadaused three methods to validate and quantitate pesticides
from various cannabis matrices and then inspect licensed
cultivation sites to reveal unauthorized pesticide controlproducts in use.
[51]The first method detected 39 pesticides
in cannabis leaves, the second 32 pesticides in cannabis
flowers, and the third 40 pesticides in cannabis oils. All of
these methods used a combination of LC/GC-MS/MS.Another interesting paper outlines possible pesticide remedi-ation techniques for the cannabis industry.
[52]The German
research group used computer modeling to look at simultan-
eous CBD isolation and pesticide removal using liquid-liquid
chromatography. The group outlines three solvent systemscapable of achieving both goals and even produces a flow-sheet on which solvent system to use based on the pesticide
responsible for the contamination. Perhaps the most com-
prehensive study of pesticides in cannabis though, looked at367 pesticides using QuEChERS cleanup and both LC-MS/MS (290 pesticides) and GC-MS/MS (78 pesticides) analyses.Most analytes had recoveries in the 70 –120% range.
[47]
Generally, the peer-reviewed literature sheds light on a
couple analytical trends in cannabis testing laboratories
regarding pesticides: (1) pesticide testing is difficult and
requires advanced analytical instrumentation and highlyskilled staff to meet regulatory demands with a robust,accurate and precise test method, (2) LC-MS/MS andGC-MS/MS are preferred by most groups, and (3)
QuEChERS is the preferred sample clean up step.
[53,54]
Mycotoxins
Cannabis and hemp, as with other commodity crops, is sus-
ceptible to contamination from fungi during growth, proc-essing and storage.
[55,56]Fresh cannabis has a water activity
(Aw) of 0.95 A w, but to prevent most fungal growth a water
activity below 0.65 A wis required.[57]For example, the
Botrytis genus of fungi is most commonly found postharvest
and has a water activity threshold of 0.85 A w.[57]There are
currently at least 88 known fungal species affecting cannabis
during the growth stage.[58–60]Commonly found fungal gen-
era include Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium,
Penicillium and Trichothecium.[61]These pathogens can be
found in the foliar and stem regions of the plant, but can
also be soilborne.[61]It is for this reason microbial testing
(vide infra ) of cannabis is required in all regulated regions
in Canada and the US. Certain genera of these fungi havethe ability to produce secondary metabolites known as
mycotoxins, which can elicit various forms of acute toxicity
if consumed. For this reason, analysis of mycotoxins is alsorequired in many regulatory jurisdictions.
The simplest and most common approach for mycotoxin
sample preparation employs a broad spectrum solvent408 S. GOLDMAN ET AL.
extraction, typically with acetonitrile, using anywhere
between 5 and 10 mL of solvent per gram of cannabis.Other solvents including toluene, ethyl acetate and methanol
have shown reduced extraction efficiencies.
[28]It has been
found that wetting the sample prior to acetonitrile additionwith a small volume (roughly 20% of the acetonitrile vol-ume) of water or isopropyl alcohol can improve extractionyields and precision.
[62–65]. The addition of this wetting step
can increase the polar matrix co-extractables, which could
result in matrix effects during analysis (i.e., by LC-MS/MS).
[62]The addition of QuEChERS salts to separate the
acetonitrile and water layers can mitigate this, while stillshowing high extraction efficiencies for mycotoxins.
[62,66]
As mycotoxins are surface contaminants typically found
at the foliar and stem junctions, it has been reported thatmeasuring the whole flower bud without grinding was keyfor high extraction recoveries.
[28]Of course, measuring
exposure from a single flower presents questions about
homogeneity across a given plant, row, crop, etc that would
need to be weighed by regulatory agencies if/when theydefine sampling procedures for mycotoxin testing.Moreover, differences have been reported for measuredextraction efficiencies between spiked samples (i.e., thoseused for method validation) and samples with incurred
mycotoxins, especially without the inclusion of a wetting
step.
[62]For this reason, matrix-matched calibrations can be
important for method accuracy and to compensate formatrix effects during analysis. This also highlights theimportance for the development of certified reference mate-
rials to support cannabis testing programs ( vide infra ).
Because mycotoxins can be analyzed alongside pesticides
using LC-MS/MS, employing selective clean-up stepsincreases the risk of analyte loss, especially in a multiresiduemethod. Although, depending on instrument sensitivity, it
may be necessary to use SPE sorbents that are selective for
mycotoxins to meet regulatory limits. A common dispersivesolid-phase extraction (dSPE) cleanup step employs primaryand secondary amine sorbents (PSA), graphitized carbonblack (GCB) and MgSO
4. This has shown to result in com-
plete loss of mycotoxins.[28]GCB is added to remove chloro-
phyll, but will adsorb planar analytes, such as theaflatoxins.
[67]Flow-through SPE (where sample are loaded
and eluted in an organic solvent in a single step) withreverse phase cartridges, typically with C
18sorbents, is
becoming increasingly common for multi-residue meth-
ods.[51]However, this has also been shown to result in up to
a 50% loss in mycotoxins during clean-up.[28]In instances
where no loss of mycotoxins was observed, the flow-throughSPE clean-up was not shown to improve matrix effects dur-ing LC-MS/MS analysis but may help with method
robustness.
[62]
Immunoaffinity columns (IACs) are designed for myco-
toxin extraction and cleanup. These employ bound antibod-ies designed to specifically retain mycotoxins from complexmatrices.
[68]Since these columns are specifically designed
for mycotoxins, they do not retain pesticides, and as such,
are typically not used when LC-MS/MS is used for detec-tion. They are, however, common when HPLC withfluorescence detection is used for mycotoxin quantification.
Because IACs are so selective, it is often the case that mul-tiple IACs must be used in tandem when multiple classes of
mycotoxins are being analyzed.
[57,69]Employing HPLC with
fluorescence detection typically also necessitates multiplechromatographic methods. Multi-mycotoxin IACs have alsobeen developed to mitigate the use of multiple columns.These have been used successfully in cannabis and show
acceptable but variable recoveries, down to 60% for certain
mycotoxin classes.
[70–72]
As mycotoxins are commonly analyzed alongside pesti-
cides, chromatography invariably employs cross-bonded orpolar-embedded C
18stationary phases for separation, with
mass spectrometry compatible mobile phases of methanoland water including ammonium formate and formic acid as
the modifier.
[28,62,65,66]. Mycotoxins have also been analyzed
using an enzyme linked immune assay (ELISA). Thesemethods show detection levels in the single-digit ng/g range(making them compliant with current regulations), but
require an individual assay per analyte.
[73]Further, these
assays have the potential for up to 25% cross reactivity fromother analytes, resulting in potential false positive results.
[73]
Notwithstanding these challenges, cannabis labs will some-
times employ ELISA-based methods as a rapid, high-
throughput screen under the assumption that most samples
will be negative. Assuming that appropriate quality controlcheck points are used, such an approach represents anattractive method of increasing testing throughput.
Only a subset of mycotoxins including aflatoxins (B1, B2,
G1, G2) and ochratoxin A are required to be monitored inCannabis, based on current regulations in Canada and the
US. These are primarily produced by Aspergillus and
Penicillium genera.
[61,74–77]The United States Pharmacopeia
(USP) currently recommends an MRL of 20 ng/g for thesummed concentration of aflatoxins, with an MRL of 5 ng/g
for aflatoxin B1.
[9]MRLs for ochratoxin A are commonly
set at 20 ng/g, as with California state regulations.[78]
Although as of July 2021, Colorado has an ochratoxin A
limit in hemp of 5 ng/g. The European Pharmacopeia hasimplemented lower MRLs for aflatoxins in herbal drugs, set
at 4 ng/g for total aflatoxins and 2 ng/g for aflatoxin B1. An
MRL for ochratoxin A, however, is not established.Fusarium and Trichothecium fungi have been detected in
cannabis plants, which have the ability to produce additional
mycotoxins including fumonisons, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol
and T2 toxin.
[79–81]Methods looking for mycotoxins beyond
regulated lists have also found direct evidence of T2 toxin,zearalenone, zearalenone, and various enniatins.
[66]For this
reason, it may be pertinent to expand mycotoxin testing
beyond aflatoxins and ochratoxin A to support consumer
health and safety as it pertains to cannabis consumption.
Residual solvents
As of the writing of this review, 34 states have legalizedmedical and/or recreational use of cannabis and cannabis
products in the United States. Among these states, 22 of
them developed laboratory or state mandatory residualJOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES 409
solvents testing for product safety.[82,83]Canada and some
European countries also started to regulate residual solvent
testing for cannabis oil, concentrate or inhalation prod-
ucts.[84,85]Because of its Schedule I status in the United
States, the unified safety measures at the federal level are
not applied to cannabis, leading to a lack of standardization
in residual solvent testing. As a result, each state has selectedits own residual solvents and associated MRLs. For example,in Colorado, eleven residual solvents are listed in the test
regulations for cannabis concentrates with the action limits
ranging from 2 ppm to 1000 ppm.
[86]In California, twenty
residual solvents are required to be tested in cannabis pre-
rolls and products. The 20 residual solvents are divided into
two categories based on their health concerns. Category 1compounds have an MRL of 1 ppm and Category 2 com-
pounds have MRLs ranging from 290 to 5000 ppm.
[87]
MRLs for residual solvents are generally established by refer-
encing state standards (e.g., the Department of CannabisControl in California) and federal organizations such as the
Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
(OEHHA), the United States Environmental ProtectionAgency (USEPA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR), National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the UnitedStates Pharmacopeial Convention (USP). Research from
most common solvents and processing chemicals used in
the cannabis industry and the results of exploratory labora-tory testing are also used to establish MRLs. In Canada,twenty-eight residual solvents are required to be tested in
cannabis oil with a blanket MRL for each compound
of 5000 ppm.
[85]
Certain chemicals and solvents, such as propane, butane,
hydrocarbons, water, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, and hex-
ane are frequently employed during cannabis extractionprocesses.
[40,88]Such solvents are used to reduce production
costs and preserve incurred terpenes, in addition to their
use by illicit extraction facilities.[89–91]Chemicals used dur-
ing the processing of cannabis from machine operations andproduct packaging may also contaminate the end prod-
ucts,
[92]with a recent study of 57 cannabis samples con-
ducted by Raber et al. showing that over 80% of theconcentrates evaluated contained residual solvents.
[40]
Producers of cannabis concentrates and derivative products
are adding terpenes to tinctures, vaping oils, lotions, foods,and beverages to enhance the flavor, make claims of health
benefits, or replicate the original terpene profile lost during
the cannabis extraction process. Also, thinning/cuttingagents such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, ormedium-chain triglycerides are added to vape oil to change
product viscosity, and/or reduce the cost of production.
[93]
These added terpenes, be they cannabis, botanical, or syn-
thetic in origin, create another potential source of residual
solvents in cannabis products. Furthermore, added terpenes
and thinning/cutting agents may interact with each other orundergo thermoxidative degradation during the vaping pro-
cess to form, among other things, analytes included in
residual solvent compliance testing.
[94]Residual solvents
formed in this manner are beyond the scope of currentcompliance regulations but nevertheless represent an
important public health consideration.
Most of the published residual solvents test regulations
reference USP <467>, which is a gold standard for pharma-
ceutical products.[95]The common solvents present in drug
substances, excipients, and finished products were welldefined and the testing methods described in USP <467>
have been implemented for decades. However, manufactur-ing of cannabis products differs greatly from pharmaceuti-cals, especially in their use of compounds such as propane,
butane and isobutane during the extraction process.
Moreover, cannabis is a complex matrix compared to typicalpharmaceuticals, and derivative products further complicatethings with matrices including joints, concentrates/distillate,e-juice, topicals, oral supplements, tinctures, capsules, andinfused edibles such as candies, chocolates, mint/chews,dried meat, crackers, dairy products and baked goods. Giventhese differences, USP <467>is a good starting point, but
does not have the necessary scope to deal with canna-
bis products.
There are limited methodologies for residual solvent test-
ing in cannabis products. Gravimetric analysis (e.g., for class3 volatile solvents specified in USP <467>is simple, but
needs larger amounts of samples and lacks specificity toidentify the volatile analytes.
[96]Spectroscopic and spectro-
metric tests have low sensitivity in general and are therefore
not applicable for regulatory requirements that specify anyCategory I analytes. GC as a chief and preferred method ofsolvent analysis has been used by pharmaceutical manufac-turers for decades and is the most appropriate, specific ana-lysis for residual solvent testing.
[97]Similarly, GC is the
most dominant and successful tool in cannabis research andtesting for residual solvents.
[91,96]Many methods for residual
solvent testing using headspace (HS) GC-MS or GC-FID to
utilize sample introduction, GC separation, and analytedetection.
[88,98–101]
Sample introduction has three main procedures and they
are direct injection, HS analysis, and solid-phase microex-traction (SPME). Direct injection is simple, reliable and a
standard autosampler can be used. The samples are usually
dissolved in an appropriate extraction solvent (i.e., not ananalyte) prior to analysis.
[97,102]Direct injection introduces
liquid samples into the GC system and so care must betaken to mitigate matrix interferences and the potential formore frequent system maintenance due to contamination ofthe inlet and/or head of the analytical column. Because ofthese drawbacks, the direct injection method has become
less popular and replaced by the HS sampling in residual
solvent testing in recent years.
HS sampling is an indirect testing procedure. The ana-
lysis is conducted when a volume of gas above the samplematrix is collected and analyzed by a GC. The major typesof headspace-sampling techniques are: dynamic HS sampling
(also referred to as purge-and-trap) and static HS sampling.
In dynamic HS sampling, a continuous gas flow is sweptover the surface of a sample matrix. Volatiles from the sam-ple matrix are conveyed into a trap where the volatileresidual solvents are accumulated prior to analysis. Whereas410 S. GOLDMAN ET AL.
dynamic HS sampling is particularly suited for the deter-
mination of analytes at very low concentrations,[103]static
HS sampling is the most widely used technique for residual
solvent analysis in the cannabis industry. In static HS, aliquid or sometimes a solid sample is placed into a sealedvial where it is heated until a thermodynamic equilibrium
between the sample and the gas phase is reached. A volume
of the headspace gas is then sampled for analysis. Theadvantage of the HS sampling is simplified sample prepar-ation, as homogenized or diluted samples can be directly ali-
quoted for analysis. Since only the gas phase of the samples
are injected into GC system, matrix interferences are signifi-cantly reduced. The nonvolatile matrix components remainin the sample vial, which limits GC maintenance relative toother.
[88,97,102]However, one disadvantage of the HS sam-
pling is the possibility of over saturation of the detectors for
analytes with high sensitives or concentrations depending onthe liner dynamic range of the detector used. Anotherpotential bias possibly introduced by HS techniques is that
some residual solvents have higher boiling point, and this
may contribute to partial pressure change in headspace gasphase due to incurred volatiles, especially in complex canna-bis matrices. To overcome these potential matrix effects, full
evaporation technique (FET) can be implemented into HS
sampling. FET sample preparation involves the use of a verysmall sample amount (e.g., 5 –20 mg), which effectively cre-
ates a single-phase gas system in the headspace vial at equi-
librium, effectively mitigating the matrix issues
discussed above.
[98]
Finally, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has made
much progress in recent years for cannabis related research
and testing.[96,104]In SPME, a silica fiber coated with a sor-
bent is used to collect and concentrate the volatile compo-nents of a sample prior to analysis. The selectivity of thefiber can be modified by changing the phase chemistry and/
or thickness according to the characteristics of the analytes.
In general, there are two types of SPME - headspace andimmersion. Direct HS SPME has been demonstrated to bemore sensitive than immersion SPME for polar residual sol-
vents. In recent years, direct HS SPME has gained a sturdy
reputation as a valid alternative to HS GC because of thesimplicity of the procedure and the low cost of hard-ware.
[105]However, its detection limits may be lower than
headspace GC. In addition, the SPME fiber extraction effi-
ciency changes with the wear (number of injections), whichcan cause poor inter-batch reproducibility. These facts mayreduce the applicability of HS SPME in routine determina-
tions of residual solvents in cannabis products.
MS and flame ionization detectors (FID) are the most
common detectors for residual solvent testing.
[97]GC-FID is
adequately used for known specific residual solvents and
chemicals in cannabis testing. However, the lack of specifi-
city of the FID and its dependance on hydrocarbons in theanalyte can create analytical challenges for certain regulatoryjurisdictions. For example, DMSO has low sensitivity using
FID and can challenge to chromatographically separate
some residual solvents sufficiently (e.g., without the addedspecificity of an MS detector). In some instances, it may notbe possible to overcome these limitations through a single
GC column phase. For complicated separations like this,
two capillary columns with different stationary phases can
be combined in series (tandem) to obtain tunable selectivity.This two-dimensional GC chromatography improves chro-matographic separation, which may be necessary in complex
cannabis matrices, especially when dealing with large lists of
residual solvents.
[98,106]The most utilized capillary columns
for GC separation are composed of 6% cyanopropylphenyl,94% dimethylpolysiloxane stationary phases (624-type col-
umns). This type of MS column is designed specifically for
volatiles analysis and is widely used for the analysis ofresidual solvents.
[98]As specified in USP <467>, USP
phase G43 (polyethylene glycol stationary phase; WAX-typecolumns) are the usual choice, as they represent an orthog-
onal column chemistry to the 624-type columns when trying
to resolve co-eluting residual solvents.
GC-MS can be used for the determination of known
residual solvents or processing chemicals in cannabis prod-
ucts and it also has the capability to identify unknownsusing mass spectral libraries. Based on the unique massspectrum of each analyte, GC-MS data processing software
can deconvolute coeluting compounds and permit accurate
integration of each component. MRLs for residual solventsgenerally range from 1 ppm (detection limit) to 5000 ppm.To cover such a wide concentration range, both full scan
and single ion monitoring (SIM) modes may be used simul-
taneously in one MS method,
[107]or a SIM only method can
be used.[100]For example, compounds such as propane and
ethylene oxide, as well as chloroform, benzene, and 1,2-dichloroethane are notoriously difficult to quantitate accur-
ately due to their high volatility and poor response - SIM
can help reduce chemical background to achieve sufficientsensitivity for such compounds. However, GC-MS may suf-fer from detector saturation for analytes with high sensitiv-
ities and/or high MRLs, especially when trying to implement
multi-residue methods with Class 1 solvents. In addition,SIM may not have suitable specificity for low molecularweight residual solvents, those that share hydrocarbon back-
bones (e.g., pentane and hexane) and those with common
functional groups. In such cases, orthogonal column chemis-tries (vide supra) or alternate MS techniques (e.g., GC-MS/MS) may be necessary. The need for these alternate techni-
ques may be exacerbated in the presence of high concentra-
tions of terpenes.
[108,109]
Standard preparation and storage represents a unique
challenge for residual solvent quantitation, especially for
highly volatile compounds such as propane, butane, ethyleneoxide, etc. Gas tight vials and gas tight syringes need to beused during their preparation, and it is advisable to storeand open standards cold (e.g., /C020
/C14C) to limit losses due to
volatility. Even with these precautions, standards (supplied
in sealed ampules) are only good for a single use. Therefore,efficiency from sample preparation to data reporting inresidual solvent testing is key. The authors have developed
and validated a screening method to detect and semi-quanti-
tate the residual solvents listed in the California test regula-tions (data not yet published). In this method, a single-pointJOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES 411
calibration and average response factor are used to identify
and estimate residual solvent concentrations. Owing to thissemiquantitative screening approach, a full sequence with
multiple calibration points and quality control samples are
only carried out for samples above compliance MRLs.
Heavy metals
Toxic elements with densities greater than 5 g/cm3and
atomic numbers higher than 11 have traditionally been
called heavy metals.[110]Of the 90 naturally occurring ele-
ments, 53 can be classified as metals (and one metalloid,As).
[111]These elements can include lead, cadmium, arsenic,
mercury, cobalt, vanadium, nickel, lithium, antimony, bar-
ium, molybdenum, copper, tin, and chromium amongothers. Low concentrations of these metals (lower even than
0.01 mg/L have been shown to be toxic to humans.
[110]
Some of these elements are essential plant nutrients (Cr,
Mn, Mo, Zn, Fe, Co, Cu, Al, Ni) and some are non-essentialelements that can lead to toxicity even at trace levels (Cd,
Pb, As, Hg).
[112,113]Many species exist in different oxidation
states and will have different biological impacts dependingon their route of exposure; inhalation versus ingestion of
cannabis products is an excellent example of this, as is the
relative toxicity of Cr
6þversus Cr3þ.
Metals are found in the Earth ’s crust in varying concen-
trations. They are introduced through uncontrolled
anthropic activities such as mining, transportation, smelting,and agricultural applications.
[113]Typically, they appear in
food and cannabis products through plant bioaccumulation,
cross contamination during processing, or post-process adul-
teration.[114]There are ways to use cannabis and cannabis
products to remediate soils and water contaminated with
toxic elements[115,116]but those have not been adopted at
industrial scales yet. Metals can contaminate soils throughrunoff from industrial manufacturing plants, direct applica-tions of fertilizers and pesticides, the application of animals
wastes or sludges, and the atmospheric deposition of metal-
containing particulate matter. It is also known that wildfiresand volcanic eruptions in one location can deposit heavymetal containing ash on crops hundreds of miles away.
[117]
In soil, where healthy pH is typically 5.5 –7, metal cations
are bound to negatively charged particles such as clay,
humus, and other organic matter. Only when unbound, are
metals bioavailable. Several studies have discussed the mobil-ity and availability of metals under specific soil conditionsincluding the effects of rhizosphere specific bacteria on plant
uptake.
[113]At low pH, metals like lead, copper, mercury,
and cadmium are more available for plant uptake. Somespecific transport systems can also transport metals, such as
phosphate systems for arsenic and cadmium and lead
through divalent metal transporters (used for iron, calcium,and zinc typically).
[111,113]
Cadmium has been shown to be enriched in some phos-
phate-based fertilizers[114]and thus available for plant
uptake. High concentrations of cadmium in soil are associ-
ated with iron deficiency in some plants[113]leading to
higher application of fertilizers and a feedback loop ofincreasing contaminant concentrations. Similarly, metal
uptake can cause signs of disease in plants, such as spots onthe leaf surface,
[110]which can again cause cultivators to
apply more fertilizers, thinking the cause of the disease was
a nutrient deficiency. Mercury can enter plant stomatalopenings through gas exchange (mercury is volatile ataround 30 Celsius) and can also enter plant roots in certainoxidation states.
[113]Metals can hyperaccumulate in plants
with levels of cadmium and selenium seen over 100 ppm in
dry leaf tissue, chromium, and copper over 300 ppm, whilelead and arsenic and nickel can reach 1000 ppm.
[113]It is
not uncommon for metal concentrations in Cannabis to bio-accumulate by tissue location, with higher levels in rootsand leaves than in the stems themselves.
[118]
Most metals do not degrade quickly or easily leading to
their ability to bioaccumulate up the food chain. Cadmiumis a bluish white metal usually from zinc ore processing.Chronic cadmium exposure can cause Itai-Itai disease, char-
acterized by intense bone pain and numbness in extrem-
ities.
[119]Lead is a silver to gray soft metal. It is widely used
and can exist over 30 years in bones. Lead is a calcium ana-log that interferes with ion channels. In Leipzig Germany,illicit lead was added to Cannabis to increase its mass, andtherefore its value. Hundreds of patients exhibited nausea,
acute colic, loss of appetite and weight, and chronic
fatigue.
[119]Mercury is a silver metal that is liquid at stand-
ard temperature (0/C14C). Mercury vapors can cause forgetful-
ness, irritability, tremors, and paranoia. Arsenic is colorlessor gray and can lead to skin cancer and lesions, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease and infant mortality.
[119,120]
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
has classified metals into three categories based on carcino-genicity in humans. As, Cd, Cr, and Ni are all group 1 (pro-ven carcinogens). Inorganic lead and methyl mercury are in
group 2 (probable carcinogens), while Organic lead and
metallic mercury are in group 3 (possible carcinogens).
[117]
Similarly, the international Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR) has ranked As, Pb, Hg, and Cdas the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 7th most hazardous substances for
toxicological profiles.
[111]
Given the high toxicity of metals at low concentrations, it
is important to quantitate them at low levels (part per bil-lion or lower). Common methods to prepare samples to runhistorically included the addition of concentrated acid fol-
lowed by heating such as EPA methods 200.2, 200.7 or
200.8.
[121–123]More common in high throughput laborato-
ries is to digest material in microwaves (microwave diges-tion
[124]). Many traditional methods to detect metals have
included atomic absorption spectrometry, x-ray fluorescence
and proton induced x-ray emission but struggle to meet
these detection limits.[125]More common in today ’s labora-
tories are inductively coupled plasma (ICP) with eitheroptical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) or mass spectrom-etry (ICP-MS)
[117]Due to many stringent testing require-
ments for heavy metals, ICP-MS has become the preferred
technique, as it enables higher throughput, can reach lower
detection limits, can detect multiple elements concurrentlyand has a larger linear range than ICP-OES. Some groups412 S. GOLDMAN ET AL.
have turned to electrochemical microfluidics techniques[126]
and observed part-per-billion detection levels. These techni-
ques have not seen mass adoption, however, due to high
costs and increasing complexity.
Multiple studies have used ICP-MS to detect metal con-
centrations in cannabis plants and products.[112,120,124,125,127]
Studies in Greece have found low part-per-million concen-
trations of arsenic, chromium, lead, and cadmium in canna-bis flower samples.
[120]A screen of CBD products in the UK
found lead and arsenic in the low part-per-million range[124]
while studies in Poland have detected lead, cadmium,
arsenic, aluminum, and nickel in a screen of dietary supple-ments and dried medicinal plants.m
[112]Further screens in
the United States have also confirmed arsenic, cadmium,and lead in CBD pet products
[127]and the authors own net-
work of laboratories regularly finds metal contamination in
cannabis and hemp products in multiple states (datanot published).
Given the propensity for cannabis plants to accumulate
metals from contaminated soils
[115,128]and the fact that the
cheapest method of cultivation is to grow outdoors, it islikely metal contamination is a problem that is not going
away soon. Without federal oversight, states are left to them-
selves to regulate which metals to test for and at what levels.Most states are testing for As, Cd, Hg, and Pb, which arecategorized as Class 1 elements by the US FDA guid-
ance.
[129]Maryland has added chromium, selenium, barium
and silver to their list while New York has added nickel,chromium, copper, antimony, and zinc. NIST has recentlycreated hemp reference material which includes lead, cad-mium, arsenic, mercury, beryllium, cobalt, vanadium, chro-
mium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and
uranium.
[129]In 2022, Colorado will mandate the emissions
of vaping products be tested for arsenic, lead, cadmium, andmercury. This is increasingly interesting, as the e-juice is in
contact with various metal parts in the vaping device, for
example, the heating coil. The fate of metals in different oxi-dation states that may be produced under pyrolysis and vap-ing conditions (high temperatures but not pyrolysis) isunknown. Due to vaping metal component interactions Cr,
and Ni are under study by various groups in cannabis-
containing e-juice and may be under consideration for can-nabis regulation in states beyond Colorado.
[130,131]
Microbiological testing
Identifying and monitoring the diversity of microbiota in
cannabis inflorescence and cannabis products can shed light
on not only the quality attributes of cannabis, but also theprevalence of pathogens that have the potential to pose pub-lic health and safety concerns, especially in immunocom-
promised populations. Studies on the microbiome of
cannabis inflorescence reveal a natural abundance of a widevariety of fungal and bacterial microorganisms, some ofwhich can be pathogenic to humans.
[132]Additionally, culti-
vation practices, product manufacturing processes, and
ingredients involved in manufacturing cannabis infused
products introduce potential external sources of microbialcontamination for consideration. Noting the natural and
external sources of microbes to cannabis, it is imperativethat adequate methodologies are employed to test cannabis
and cannabis products for the presence, and when applic-
able, concentration of microbes to ensure quality and healthstandards are met.
[9,114]
In the current regulatory landscape within markets that
have legal cannabis industries, Salmonella spp. and
Escherichia coli, particularly Shiga toxin-producing
Escherichia coli (STEC), are considered to be important
enteric pathogens due to their potential to cause human dis-ease and outbreak and their prevalence in a variety of agri-cultural, food, and general environmental settings.
Salmonella spp . can serve as the causative agents of salmon-
ellosis, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever, among otherpotentially fatal diseases. STEC are also facultative anaerobesthat express virulence factors Shiga toxin type 1 and type 2and when hosted in humans can cause hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS), often indicated by bloody or non-bloody
diarrhea, that can progress to a life threatening state.Additionally, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,Staphylococcus aur-
eus, and bile tolerant gram negative (BTGN) bacteria have
been implicated as pathogens of interest when consideringtesting requirements. Because all of these pathogens have
prevalence in the environment and animals and can be
transmitted through the production, processing, manufactur-ing, and dispensing of cannabis and cannabis products, it iscritical that these types of products and processes areadequately and efficiently monitored to protect human and
environmental health.
Studies regarding the mycoflora present in cannabis
inflorescence demonstrate the prevalence of Aspergillus spp.,
Penicillium spp. ,Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium spp., among
others.
[114,132–135]Of these fungal organisms, Aspergillus
spp., in particular the human pathogenic species Aspergillus
niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and
Aspergillus terreus , have been a focal point of public health
concern and subsequent testing regulations for cannabis.This is due to their known ubiquity in the environment,
soil, and natural plant products, and incidence in clinical
cases as the causative agent of aspergillosis in immunocom-promised patients who had reported cannabis use.
[9,119,136]
Aspergillosis is a disease that ranges in medical effects from
invasive lung infection to the formation of aspergillomas(fungal balls) to allergic reactions, and cannabis use via
inhaled modes of consumption indicates a higher risk for
infection, especially in users with already compromisedimmune function. For this reason, Aspergillus spp. is more
commonly required for testing in cannabis and cannabisproducts, although other fungal pathogens may also be
of concern.
As testing for microbial contaminants in cannabis is a
relatively nascent development, cannabis testing facilitiesand method developers have both looked to analogousindustries for testing standards and guidance, as well as
emerging technologies to meet the evolving needs of the
cannabis space. Most commonly, either qualitative presence/absence tests or quantitative general microbial count testsJOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES 413
are applied to cannabis products, although the need for add-
itional confirmatory tests and metagenomics analyses haveproven important in both confirming presumptive results
and surveying cannabis materials for the prevalence of cer-
tain microorganisms.
In general, contaminants are known to be pathogenic to
humans, such as Salmonella spp., STEC, and Aspergillus spp.
require a qualitative presence/absence analysis, whereas testsevaluating the overall quality attributes of cannabis or can-nabis products, such as viable yeast and mold count
(TYMC) and total aerobic count (TAC) involve a quantita-
tive overview of microbial populations within a given sam-ple. Method references such as the FDA BacteriologicalAnalytical Manual Chapters 4 and 5 have provided thefoundation of Salmonella spp. and STEC analysis for many
emerging methods in cannabis.
[137,138]Furthermore, entities
like AOAC International have developed guidance docu-ments to aid in the establishment of method performancerequirements to assist in the development, validation, and
approval of microbial contaminant analysis methods specif-
ically in cannabis.
[139–141]In addition, USP general chapters
<61>,<62>, and<1111>provide direction for the estab-
lishment of appropriate limits for general count tests andalso methodological guidance.
[9,142–144]This has influenced
testing methodologies for microbial contaminants in the
cannabis space to revolve around culture-based isolation andidentification and quantitative polymerase-chain reaction(qPCR) analysis, although other culture-based, mass spectral,
and molecular technologies are being developed and
implemented.
As cannabis and the process of its cultivation, harvesting,
product manufacturing, and distribution are further studied,
an increasing understanding of prevalent microbial contami-nants and their respective implications on public and envir-onmental health will be better understood. Currently, there
is some research into the microbiome populations that occur
naturally on the cannabis plant, and as well as other micro-bial pathogens that have susceptibility to contaminationthrough manufacturing and handling practices in the canna-bis and analogous industries that have guided the establish-
ment of testing regulations and corresponding microbial
analysis methodologies. As the industry matures, the devel-opment of inter-laboratory, reproducible reference methodsin conjunction with the evolution of new testing technolo-
gies will continue to drive innovation in rapid, accurate, and
consistent cannabis microbial analysis to support overallconfidence in the quality attributes of cannabis and cannabisproducts, for both the general consumer and med-ical patients.
Certified reference materials and method
standardization
The lack of method standardization in potency testing has
led to a variety of test methods being used for cannabinoidquantitation, adding to the potential for variability in results
between testing.
[5,8,145]Not only is this an issue of analytical
accuracy and consumer safety (e.g., does the consumer reallyknow the potency of a product given interlaboratory vari-
ability?), it also undermines the confidence that cannabis
growers and processors have in the entire testing process.
While organizations like AOAC International have codifiedmethods for the quantitation of cannabinoids in flower,
[6]
concentrates and oils[146]and more recently in edible choco-
lates (methods not yet published), regulatory agencies have,
as yet, not mandated the use of specific methods. Forexample, water quality test methods in the US are based onstandard Environmental Protection Agency, with all labora-
tories contracted to do this testing running the same method
and adhering to the same method validation and data qual-ity criteria. Moreover, these labs are required to demonstrateongoing proof of performance for a given test methodthrough participation in interlaboratory studies and profi-
ciency testing programs. This type of standardization would
provide a clear quality management framework within whichcannabis testing laboratories should operate. Not only wouldthis improve data quality and consistency across the canna-
bis industry, it would also increase consumer confidence in
the analytical results provided by different laboratories.Hindering this type of effort is the secrecy with which labo-ratories guard their test methods due to the perception that
they are private intellectual property. This lack of open sci-
entific communication hinders method standardization (e.g.,developing consensus methods). While used as an example,this problem is not unique to potency testing —all of the test
methods discussion herein are facing the same challenges
when it comes to a lack of method standardization.
Closely tied to the lack of method standardization, is the
fact that no consistent guidance on method validation is
provided for cannabis compliance testing. To be fair,
method validation is inherently ambiguous, with a plethoraof ways to approach the evaluation of the core parametersof linearity, accuracy, precision, repeatability and robustness.
Not to mention to myriad ways to calculate the limit of
detection and/or limit of quantitation for a given testmethod.
[147]This lack of standardization across the industry
also adds to the potential for disparate results when compar-
ing data between laboratories (as many cannabis growers
and processors rightly do).
Finally, connecting method standardization and method
validation is the challenge of developing certified reference
materials (CRMs) to support compliance testing labs withmaterials to document the validity of their method valid-ation results and test methods in general. The importance of
CRMs was highlighted in a recent mycotoxin study, where
differences were observed for the measured extraction effi-ciencies between spiked samples and samples with incurredmycotoxins, especially without the inclusion of a wettingstep.
[62]This study highlights a common limitation of spike-
recovery studies that are used for method validation and
emphasis the need for CRMs that can be used to assessmethod performance internally. The same challenge hasbeen raised for pesticides, where the question of sequestra-
tion in the plant during maturation and the effect that may
have on extraction efficiency is an important consideration.And for volatile analytes (e.g., residual solvent and terpenes),414 S. GOLDMAN ET AL.
the development of CRMs may present logistical challenges
related to analyte retention during storage, transport andprior to analysis on-site at a cannabis testing laboratory.
It is worth noting that there are several cannabis/hemp
proficiency testing programs, and participation in such pro-grams is actually required as part of ISO/IEC 17025
accreditation. Such programs are not a substitute for CRMs
though. Rather, they are another arm of a robust qualitymanagement system meant to facilitate method validity ( ver-
susconsensus values) and data transparency. While invalu-
able, the reliance on a consensus value is not a measure of
trueness, per se , as it could be influenced by systematic
issues. For example, in 2020 a major supplier of analyticalstandards provided notification to cannabis testing laborato-ries that their certificate of authenticity label claim for a par-
ticular lot of THC standard was not accurate. This created
the potential for a whole segment of testing laboratories(that used that particular lot of THC from that vendor) tohave a systematic bias in their THC values reported to cli-
ents, and possibly as part of a given proficiency testing
study. A recent initiative by the National Institute forStandards and Technology (NIST) is working to address ref-erence materials through their CannaQAP program,
[148]
which covers hemp potency and, for those with a DEA
exemption, cannabis potency. In the second round of this
program, NIST also included toxic elements (i.e., heavy met-als) and moisture. Not only is this program free to partici-pate in, but NIST openly publish the aggregate
interlaboratory results. This type of transparency will help
move the cannabis industry beyond some the issuesobserved today, including the much-discussed challenge of“lab shopping. ”
[149]
Conclusions
Analytical technologies have generally found their respective
places as they pertain to potency, terpenes and chemical/bio-logical contaminants in cannabis and derivative products.However, as more testing data are acquired, more profi-ciency testing programs are evaluated, regulations change,
etc., there will be a continuing need to evolve the collective
approach to cannabis testing. Doing so will provide contin-ued support to consumer safety and will also guide theevolving regulations and testing requirements for hemp and
derivative products. As an example, consider potency, which
continues to be a primary driver for broad consumer prefer-ence in the cannabis industry. As the cannabis derivativesmarket matures, increased regulatory control as well asincreases in the number of such diverse matrices will con-
tinue to challenge testing laboratories and their support
services (e.g., proficiency testing providers, certified refer-ence material manufacturers, etc.). Moreover, as more can-nabinoids, like d8-THC, come under regulatory control, new
tools in the laboratory may be necessary to meet method
specificity requirements. Similar sets of challenges exist forthe other test methods discussed herein.
It is also worth noting that secondary metabolites of
interest in cannabis are not limited to cannabinoids andterpenes. There are variety of other chemicals of interest, fla-
vonoids
[150]for example, that may enter the cannabis testing
space. When these demands arise, the analytical testing com-
munity will need to leverage what has been learned aboutthe challenges of cannabis as a matrix to develop suitable
testing methods. Luckily, our understanding of the bounda-
ries of analytical testing in cannabis and derivative productshas made significant progress in recent years. This is a direct
result of changes in the regulatory landscape bringing can-
nabis science into the commercial marketplace —when there
is money to be made, the push toward robust, efficient test-
ing regimes will always be hastened, albeit not without some
growing pains due to a lag in the availability of the neces-sary testing infrastructure.

THC ABSTRACT  
Validated analytical testing of cannabinoid content for regulatory purposes is critical to farming high-cannabidiol 
(CBD) hemp (Cannabis sativus L.), as these methods are key to determine whether a crop is federally compliant by 
containing <0.3% THC or must be destroyed at the time of harvest. This report identifies the sources and extent 
of variation in reported cannabinoid content after flower selection and conducted a survey of ten accredited 
hemp regulatory testing laboratories, including one state-owned laboratory. The results indicate that total 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content is reported inconsistently due to an insufficient standardization of sample 
preparation and testing methods, thus likely leading to erroneous data. This work represents the early phase of 
ongoing research to enhance the consistency of cannabinoid analyses of hemp flower samples as an essential tool 
in Cannabis crop development.   
1.Introduction 
Although hemp and marijuana plants belong to the same group of 
three species, Cannabis sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis , recent agri-
cultural legislation in the U.S. has reclassified hemp, removing it from 
the Schedule 1 controlled substances list and distinguishing it from 
marijuana by using the total THC level as a threshold. These levels are 
limited to “a Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 
0.3% on a dry weight basis ” in any part of the hemp plant and any 
products derived from its cultivation (USDA Agricultural Marketing 
Service, 2019 ). This definition of hemp, tied to plant chemotype rather 
than plant genotype, stems from a 1976 taxonomical study dis-
tinguishing industrial hemp (used commonly at the time for fiber and 
food) from psychoactive, high-THC cultivars of (mostly) C. sativa 
marijuana (Small and Cronquist, 1976 ). However, hemp is known to be 
genetically distinguishable from marijuana because it lacks the allele 
coding for THCA-synthase (De Meijer et al., 2003; Sawler et al., 2015 ). 
While industrial fibrous hemp remains an important crop, an 
increasing number of farmers are cultivating medicinal cultivars of 
hemp to meet consumer demand for CBD and other cannabinoid prod-
ucts such as cannabigerol (CBG) and cannabichromene (CBC). These 
products have been shown to have pharmacological activity providing 
purported therapeutic potential for antiepileptic, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects (Bridge -
man and Abazia, 2017 ). Hemp flowers grown for medicinal use today 
contain up to 15% of CBD plus additional non-THC/non-CBD cannabi -
noids by dry weight. Depending on the growing conditions that favor 
cannabinoid production, these variants often approach or slightly 
exceed the 0.3% THC limit for classification as hemp at the time of 
harvest —despite having no psychotropic effects compared with mari-
juana, which is cultivated for the production of THC at dry-weight 
percentages commonly in excess of 20%. In general, a level of about 
1% THC is considered the threshold for cannabis to have a psychotropic 
effect (Small and Marcus, 2002 ). 
The industry faces several challenges as it attempts to scale cultiva -
tion to meet consumer demand for cannabinoid products. For example, 
categorizing cultivars becomes difficult due to variation in testing pro-
tocols and discrepancies in results between testing laboratories. How-
ever, these results are critical when quantifying the amount of THC in 
hemp flower and hemp-derived extracts, and certificates of analysis 
(COA) are compulsory for legal hemp harvest. In most states, hemp 
farmers are required to submit a request to the state 30 days before the 
anticipated harvesting time, so an official sampler can collect flowers 
from multiple plants of the same strain on the farm for compliance 
testing (CA Code of Regulations, 2021 ).

2sampling from each registered strain of hemp prepared for harvesting 
can vary slightly based on a local regulator ’s protocol. The samples are 
then sent to an analytical lab, either operated by the state or individually 
contracted, to determine the concentration of cannabinoids in each 
varietal (strain) of hemp sampled. Industry or other standard operating 
procedures for these labs are missing. In addition, none of the com-
mercial labs we evaluated provided experimental details about the 
applied methods or validation data. This may be related to the lack of 
regulations and reflect a means of maintaining a competitive advantage 
in a competitive environment. The lack of validated convention methods 
means that generally accepted standards for instruments, calibration, or 
sampling replicates are missing. However, in any state, if the test results 
reveal a total THC concentration below 0.3%, the farmer is approved to 
harvest on their listed date. However, if the THC test result is above 
0.3% it is considered “hot”, and the farmer may have to destroy the 
entire crop. 
The federal mandate distinguishes between hemp and marijuana 
based on plant chemotype, using a single marker compound (THC), but 
without establishing a convention method that is “fit for purpose ” for 
this definition. This is despite the existence of fit-for-purpose chemotype 
identification convention methods in the literature (Sarma et al., 2020 ). 
The lack of a validated convention method representing the official 
standard is particularly problematic because measurement of the THC 
concentration involves quantitation at a relatively low level, which 
poses analytical challenges, especially when performed outside highly 
controlled laboratory settings. With limited federal regulation over 
hemp analytical laboratory accreditation policies or standardized anal-
ysis protocols, the quantitation of cannabinoid composition reported by 
commercial hemp testing laboratories has the potential to vary greatly, 
including for identical samples. The sources of potential variation 
extend beyond analytic techniques and include sample storage upon 
receipt, homogenization and extraction methods, instrumentation, and 
calibration procedures. Collectively, these factors all influence the test 
results and, thereby, the ultimate decision about crop validation versus 
destruction. The development of different analytical methods to quan-
tify cannabinoids in plant products allows individual laboratories to 
compete in a growing market for hemp analysis. However, this practice 
also interferes with transparency, exacerbates inter-laboratory variation 
in analysis results, diminishes the validity of crop regulation, and calls 
the overall value of COAs into question. 
The attention focus on a single marker compound, THC, also raises 
the question about options and rationales for a more holistic analysis of 
the cannabinoid metabolome, which in fact is practically feasible. Po-
tential approaches including methods for the quantitation of 13 indi-
vidual cannabinoids have been compiled by the USP Cannabis Expert 
Panel (Sarma et al., 2020 ). However, with the legal definition of the 
Controlled Substance Act (CSA) in place, this does still not address the 
question of standardization of the analytical methodology used to 
determine cannabinoid content, including threshold CBD values. In this 
context, it should be pointed out that pharmacopeial approaches 
worldwide involve the establishment of convention methods, which are 
developed via a consensus building process and considered 
fit-for-purpose. While this approach provides a more definitive analyt -
ical framework, it does not necessarily address the levels of uncertainty 
involved in the analyses and are typically not embedded into metro -
logical frameworks by inclusion of primary reference standards (such as 
NIST benzoic acid PS1) and traceable certified reference materials 
(Nelson et al., 2018 ). 
2.Experimental 
2.1. Laboratory survey 
A total of 45 laboratories were identified via a Google search of the 
term “analytical cannabis testing labs” and contacted about their 
participation in a research survey of their analytical methods, prioritizing labs that provided services to regulatory agencies above 
those used only by the industry. Of the 45 labs contacted, 11 agreed to 
participate. One of the participating laboratories was eliminated 
because it did not offer hemp testing. The 10 participating laboratories 
were asked to extract and analyze three hemp flower samples and to 
return their cannabinoid potency test results. Surveyed laboratories 
were also asked to provide information about their instrumentation, 
standards, extraction protocols, and methods of analysis. While all of the 
participating laboratories chose to withhold their extraction and anal-
ysis protocols, they disclosed the manufacturer and make of their 
analytical instrumentation and source of reference standards employed 
for calibration. 
2.2. Preparation 
Two strains of hemp, Sample A, a high-CBG chemotype, and Sample 
B, a high-CBD chemotype, were cultivated for this survey. Samples from 
each strain were harvested on the same day. The samples were prepared 
from buds removed from the stalks and trimmed of surrounding leaves. 
The samples from each strain were collected into a bag and shaken to 
randomly distribute flowers collected from individual plants for distri -
bution to the testing facilities. Homogenized samples were ground using 
a Spex 2010 Geno/Grinder 115 V. Flowers from each sample were added 
to 50 mL centrifuge tubes along with three steel balls. Each sample was 
run at 1000 strokes per minute for one minute, then manually stirred 
and visually inspected to ensure all flowers were ground. The grinding 
process was repeated at 1000 strokes per minute for one minute. All 
ground flower from each sample was combined in a designated 
container and mixed again to ensure a completely homogenized distri -
bution, minimizing variability due to flower selection from one indi-
vidual plant or a portion thereof to another given the same strain. 
2.3. Extraction control experiment 
To determine variation in cannabinoid results due to extraction 
solvents, an internal analysis was performed using various extraction 
solvents. Homogenized flowers from Sample B were extracted nine times 
using each of the solvents reportedly used by the labs in the survey. 
About 200 mg of homogenized flowers was added to each of nine 50 mL 
polypropylene centrifuge tubes. The exact mass of Sample B was 
recorded for each tube, and each sample was extracted with 20 mL 
ethanol (3), 20 mL isopropanol (3), or 20 mL 1:1 isopropanol and 
acetonitrile (3). Each tube was mixed with a FisherBrand VWR Multi- 
tube vortexer at speed 9 for 5 min. Each of the tubes was centrifuged 
in a Q-Sep 3000 Centrifuge 110 V for 5 min to separate residual solids 
from the supernatant. 1.5 mL of the suspended supernatant was removed 
and syringe-filtered through a Millex GP 0.22 µm filter to remove solid 
particulates. 50 µl of the supernatant was added to a 1.5 mL amber HPLC 
vial and diluted with 950 µl of the respective extraction solvent. The 
samples were analyzed using a Shimadzu LC2030 –3D plus with a PDA 
detector equipped with a NexLeaf CBX C18 column and mobile phase 
0.085% phosphoric acid in acetonitrile. The sample was compared to 
calibration standards “Certified Standard-11 Components (CRM) in 
Acetonitrile ” sourced from Cayman Chemicals. The 250 µg/mL standard 
mixture was diluted to 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 50 ppm, and 
500 ppm (R2 >0.999 for each of the 11 cannabinoids). 
2.4. Sample B extract preparation 
200.4 mg of homogenized Sample B was added to a 50 mL poly-
propylene centrifuge tube and extracted with 20 mL ethanol. The 
mixture was mixed with a FisherBrand VWR Multi-tube vortex at speed 
9 for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged in a Q-Sep 3000 Centrifuge 110 
V for 5 min. The suspended supernatant was drawn into a syringe and 
filtered using a 0.22 µm Millex GP filter. We sent each surveyed lab 1 mL 
of the filtered extract in a vial sealed using parafilm and shipped in T. Azwell et al.

instructed to dilute the sample further using ethanol as necessary prior 
to the cannabinoid potency determination. 
2.5. Data analysis 
Data provided by participating laboratories (n =10) were compiled 
into spreadsheets using the following variables to organize reported 
results for the three strains: Extraction Solvent, Instrument used, Total 
Cannabinoids, Total CBD, CBDa, CBD, CBDv, CBDva, Total THC, d9THC, 
d8THC, THCa, THCv, THCva, Total CBG, CBG, CBGa, Total CBC, CBCa, 
CBC, CBL, CBLa, CBN, CBNa. Total THC/CBD was calculated using the 
following formulas to take into account the loss of a carboxyl group 
during decarboxylation step:  
Total THC =Δ9THC +(THCa (0⋅877))                                                     
Total CBD =CBD +(CBDa (0⋅877))                                                      
Descriptive statistics were calculated, including mean, standard de-
viation (SD), relative SD, and range; missing data (for variables not 
tested or non-reported results) were ignored. Median values and inter-
quartile range were plotted using boxplots. Statistical analyses were 
conducted with Microsoft Excel and OriginPro 9.0 SR2 (v2013), which 
was also used to generate Figs. 1 and 2. 
3.Results and discussion 
For the survey used in this report, two strains of hemp, Sample A, a 
high-CBG chemotype, and Sample B, a high-CBD chemotype, were 
collected as whole flowers and distributed to laboratories that agreed to 
participate in a blind study of their analytical results and a survey of 
their testing protocols. The samples were also analyzed in our laboratory 
to further study the effects of homogenization and extraction protocols, 
and compare the results from the labs against a carefully controlled and 
transparent sample preparation, calibration, and analytic procedure. 
The reported total THC content of Sample A varied among ten surveyed 
laboratories (Fig. 1) with a mean of 0.11% (dry weight basis), a SD of 
0.10%, and three labs returning a non-detect (ND) result, indicating that 
total THC content was below the limits of their detection methods (for 
the purposes of statistical analysis, ND results were treated as a result of 
0%). Total THC/CBD is calculated using the following formulas to take 
into account the loss of a carboxyl group during decarboxylation step:  
Total THC =Δ9THC +(THCa (0⋅877)) and Total CBD =CBD +(CBDa 
(0⋅877))                                                                                                
Of the ten surveyed laboratories, one reported a result of 0.29% of THC, a value just below the legal threshold for crop destruction. The 
range of reported total THC (including THCA) content in this sample 
therefore spans 96.7% of the legally permissible total THC detection 
range for hemp, with a relative SD of 95% of the mean. This suggests that 
the applied analytical methods for total THC quantitation across sur-
veyed laboratories are not sufficiently precise at the levels required for 
the analysis of THC content in hemp. Our own analysis yielded a total 
THC content of 0.09%, close to the mean reported by the sample of 
surveyed laboratories. 
From harvest of flower samples to sample preparation, homogeni -
zation, extraction, analysis, and quantitation, multiple factors can 
contribute to the variation in the reported total THC content, indepen -
dently of the analytical method used. We probed these potential sources 
of variation by sending participating laboratories a homogenized 
(ground) Sample A, which was identified to participating laboratories as 
a third sample, Sample C. Although the plant material was identical to 
Sample A, the variation in reported results significantly decreased (SD =
0.10% in whole flower and SD =0.05% in homogenized flower), indi-
cating that, in addition to potential flower-to-flower variation, different 
homogenization methods between laboratories also contributed to sig-
nificant variation in the quantified total THC content. 
Sample B was shipped to participating laboratories homogenized 
using a GenoGrinder. In this sample, the total THC content measured in 
our laboratory (0.51%) was higher than that of Sample A. Again, only 
the mean of the total THC content reported by the ten participating 
laboratories yielded a result similar to control (0.48%), whereas the 
reported values ranged from 0.27% (compliant) to 0.59% (non-

4compliant), with a relative SD of 21% of the mean. Although the relative 
SD was lower in this sample relative to Sample A, the SD remained as 
high as 0.10% dry weight in terms of total THC content). 
While all external laboratories reported using HPLC with UV–vis 
photodiode array detectors, the solvent used to extract flower samples 
varied: nine laboratories used methanol, one laboratory a 1:1 mixture of 
isopropanol and acetonitrile. In our internal reference analysis, ethanol 
was employed as the extraction solvent. In an extraction control 
experiment, nine samples of homogenized sample B were extracted with 
either ethanol (3), methanol (3), or isopropanol/acetonitrile (3). It was 
found that ethanol yielded the most exhaustive extraction, regardless of 
whether only total THC (Table 1) or total cannabinoid content were 
compared (15.7%±0.5, 14.3%±0.2, 15.1%±0.8 for ethanol, meth -
anol, and isopropanol/acetonitrile, respectively). 
Given the success in reducing analytical variation by pre- 
homogenizing flower samples, we anticipated that extracting the ho-
mogenized flower and shipping the extract to participating laboratories 
would significantly reduce variation. However, the variation in reported 
total THC content among participating laboratories increased when pre- 
extracted samples versus whole flower samples were shipped to and 
analyzed by participating laboratories (Sample B homogenized flower 
SD =0.10% and extracted SD =0.12%). 
A pre-extracted sample should show the highest degree of homoge -
neity (lowest variation) between aliquots sampled by participating 
laboratories, as it controls for all aspects of sample harvesting and 
preparation up to analytical method and quantitation. One reason for 
the observed variations of results may be that participating laboratories 
employ sample preparation and analysis protocols for whole flower 
samples rather than liquid samples sent from customers. Here, variation 
may be due to lack of consistency of liquid sample handling, dilution 
procedures, and time to complete the analysis. 
The outcomes of this survey highlight the potential issues resulting 
from variation among laboratories testing THC content. Farmers culti-
vating hemp strains for medicinal applications, however, will be inter-
ested not only in the THC content reported in COAs, but in the content of 
many other cannabinoids quantified in hemp samples. The variation in 
total cannabinoid content is shown in Fig. 2, where it can be seen that for 
the whole flower Sample A, reported cannabinoid content spans a range 
from 9.8% to 19.4% —a huge variation. This once more highlights the 
importance of considering a wider spectrum of cannabinoids when 
evaluating cannabis materials (Sarma et al., 2020 ). 
In addition to unavoidable inter-laboratory variation, the observed 
inconsistencies of the analytical outcomes can be inherent to the method 
by which cannabinoids are measured: HPLC with photodiode array 
detection is a comparative technique that relies on efficient separation, 
which in turn depends on many factors such as the specific column and 
chromatographic conditions (mobile phase solvents, solvent gradient, 
flow rate, temperature). To achieve quantitation, the HPLC chromato -
gram of a sample is compared to a chemically identical reference ma-
terial (“standard ”) that is analyzed under identical conditions to 
establish internal or external calibration. Provided that multiple cali-
brants are available, complex mixtures can be separated and individual 
components quantified. However, peaks overlap is one major source of 
error, especially when analyzing chemically complex mixtures such as 
Cannabis extracts. For example, similar or fully overlapping retention 
times under the applied conditions —as is often the case, for instance with Δ8- vs. Δ9-THC or the cis and trans isomers — affect the specificity 
of the quantitation. Moreover, the reference materials used for calibra -
tion can undergo chemical change (degradation), which may or may not 
be captured in both externally and internally calibrated methods. In fact, 
as terpenoids, cannabinoids are known to be relatively unstable com-
pounds and commonly change after exposure to heat, light, or air (not 
counting the common decarboxylation reaction of the acid forms). 
It should be noted that analytical methods are available that are 
independent of chemically identical reference materials (calibrants). For 
example, quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) has this 
capability as it represents a (relative) primary analytical technique. Its 
suitability for natural product and pharmaceutical analysis is widely 
acknowledged and the fitness of the application of quantum mechanics- 
based qNMR has recently been demonstrated for CBD (Pauli et al., 2014; 
Nelson et al., 2020 ). 
The laboratories surveyed in this study used reference standards 
from Restek, Cerilliant, LGC, and Cayman. While most laboratories 
employed 11 standards, up to 18 standards were used to quantify 
various cannabinoids in hemp samples. Facilities that quantified a larger 
number of individual cannabinoids tended to report greater means in 
total cannabinoid content. However, no correlation was found between 
the number of calibration standards and the reported total percent 
content quantified across all facilities and all four samples. This kind of 
inconsistency highlights the analytical challenges hemp farmers face 
when evaluating the reliability of COA results and assessing the value of 
their crops. 
4.Conclusion 
This study represents a preliminary survey of the variation in re-
ported total THC content among ten commercial hemp testing facilities. 
While early, the presented evidence strongly suggests that in-
consistencies exist in reported total THC content, which leads to a reg-
ulatory liability. While the total THC content is currently the key legal 
metric defining whether a crop is harvestable or must be destroyed, it is 
not tied to, for example, a convention method that ensures validity and 
reproducibility of analytical outcomes, such as the methods found in 
pharmacopeias. The present data suggest that total THC content is 
frequently reported imprecisely, most likely due to analytical inconsis -
tency of sample preparation and testing methods. Even under the 
carefully controlled conditions of the in-house laboratory, the relative 
SD of total THC content as measured by HPLC using commercially 
available calibrants varied between 2% and 7% of the mean, depending 
on the extraction protocol employed. This variation is within the range 
of what can be expected for the quantitation of a minor (<1%) con-
stituent embedded in a complex analytical matrix and indicates the 
intrinsic limitations in peak purity as the likely key factor in HPLC-UV- 
based quantitation. 
These results suggest a significant likelihood of a hemp crop being 
marked for destruction due to inaccurate COA reporting – as well as a 
crop being labeled as compliant despite actually containing elevated 
THC levels. To support this burgeoning industry those exposed to the 
risk of growing this relatively new crop in the U.S., it would be a step 
forward to revise enforcement of COA results such that they account for 
the variation in reported total THC content, introduce methodology that 
establishes a reproducible linkage with metrological reference mate-
rials, and eliminate the inherent variability of results from different 
analytical methods. To do this, however, several factors would need to 
be carefully considered. The current regulatory specifications are simple 
numbers that do not include measurement uncertainties. Determining 
the threshold values may have involved accounting for measurement 
uncertainty, but the values do not express that. In pharmacopeial 
monographs and standards, general rules exist about precision and ac-
curacy, for example for the difference between 0.3% and 0.30%. 
Threshold values such as NMT 0.3%, however, are agnostic to statistics 
as they are expressed with only one significant number. It is always good Table 1

5to define the specifications of an analytical method to avoid this 
confusion, for example by clarifying that threshold values or ranges 
include three significant numbers, two true and one uncertain, as is 
common in analytical chemistry (Ellison and Williams, 2012 ). This will 
also allow testing labs to demonstrate their fitness for analytical pur-
poses. Considering our results, from the viewpoint of statistics alone, it 
may be adequate to introduce ranges of two SD of the legal limit when 
defining the thresholds that determine the legal designation of a crop as 
hemp vs. marijuana. 
Until these points are addressed, the definition of hemp based on an 
arbitrary number with one significant figure as upper boundary 
(“0.3% ”) of total THC content remains flawed, due to the demonstrated 
variability in the reported measurements of that value and the difficulty 
and cost of making the measurement for each crop. It should also be 
borne in mind that genotyping, rather than chemotyping, offers a 
valuable approach to the distinction of hemp from marijuana. Legal 
definitions that consider the existing analytical evidence will help pro-
tect hemp farming from the undue liability of misrepresented or inac-
curate strain identification and flawed chemical analysis, and will foster 
the rational development of hemp crops with expanded utility by means 
of specific chemotype.
