Testzmony of Rep Colleen Madzgan mtroducmg 
LD 1439, An Act to Promote Family-centered Interventions for 
Substance Use Disorder Treatment 
Before the Jomt Standmg Commzttee on Health and Human Servzces 
Good afternoon Senator Baldacc1, Representat1ve Meyer and colleagues on the Health and 
Human Sen/1ces Commlttee My name 1s Colleen Mad1gan and I l1ve 1n Waterv1lle and represent 
House D1stnct 64 I am here today to present LD 1439, An Act to Promote F am1ly-centered 
Interventlons for Substance Use D1sorder Treatment , 
In th1s Comrmttee, we have had numerous b1lls that deal w1th substance use d1sorder (SUD) 
Th1s 1s yet another one However, I th1nk 1t 1s d1fferent Substance Use D1sorder1s common It 1s 
also not one 1llness, but many We all know someone w1th substance use d1sorder People w1th 
SUD are _]l1SlZ l1ke everyone else They l1ve 1n fam1l1es The1r loved ones care about them, _]11SlZ l1ke 
they do w1th any other fa1n1ly member w1th an 1llness I thmk I have a umque perspect1ve 1n 
1nteract1ng w1th our health care system and the way substance use d1sorders are treated 
d1fferently But, perhaps I don’t My father Cll6d of congest1ve heart fa1lure 6 months before my 
slster d1ed of alcohol wlthdrawal The way my famlly was treated w1th my father was worlds 
apart from how we were treated when my slster was 111 I thlnk we need to take a look at th1s th1s 
Because 1t affects pat1ent care and outcomes It 1mpacts fam1l1es and people vv1th SUD And 1f 
we look at th1s honestly, 1t 1mpacts all of us I don’t need to remmd you that last year we hada 
record number of overdose deaths and alcohol related deaths exceeded that And that was before 
1n th1s Comnuttee we learned that our state wasn’t even countlng those properly In January 1n 
th1s Commlttee, we learned from the D1rector of Ma1neCare Servlces that our outcomes for 
persons w1th alcohol use d1sorder seen 1n emergency rooms and 1npat1ent stays are some of the 
worst 1n the natlon Clearly, we need to do better 
I have glven you a handout from the federal Substance Use and Mental Health Serv1ces 
Adm1n1strat1on I want to h1ghl1ght the ﬁrst two sentences “Involvmg famlly members 1n 
substance use d1sorder (SUD) treatment can pos1t1vely affect cl1ent engagement, retentlon and 
outcomes Pos1t1ve soc1al/fam1ly support 1s related to long term abstmence and recovery, whereas 
negatlve soc1al/fam1ly support (eg , 1nterpersonal conﬂ1ct, soc1al pressure to use) 1s related to 
rncreased nsk for relapse ” Th1s 1s not actually news Actually, we have known for decades that 
fam1ly lnvolvement 1s cruc1al 1n SUD treatment Over 40 years ago, a member of my famlly went 
D1str1ct 64 Part of Waterv1lle and pa1t of W111slow
I
to a rehab program It wasn’t a fancy rehab, Just a state funded 28 day rehab1l1tat1on program 
My famlly went tw1ce a week and were lnvolved m the treatment I am glad‘ to say that program 
worked My famlly member has been 1n recovery for over 40 years 
As I stated above, the way we treat people w1th SUD and the1r fam1ly members, partlcularly 1n 
emergency s1tuat1ons 1s very drfferent Thmk of 1t th1s way A member of your famrly hasa 
ma] or hfe-threatenrng heart attack Maybe you l1ve near one of the ma] or hospltals that hasa 
heart speclalty program or maybe your fam11y member needs to be transported there Once there, 
you w1ll get mformatlon about support for fam1ly members, places to stay, to1letr1es, etc Now 
contrast th1s w1th how famlly 1s often treated when they brmg 1n therr loved one to the ER We 
are rgnored, even though we brought our famlly member 1n I can’t tell you how many t1mesI 
trled to g1ve ER staff lnformatlon that was lmportant co-occurnng condltlons, recent behavlor, 
my famlly wantmg to be mvolved and help her engage 1n treatment I have never seen any 
ev1dence 1n medrcal records that th1s was documented 
I am aware of the l1m1tat1ons of 42 CFR Part 2 It protects the conﬁdent1al1ty of patlents 
However, when famlly members brmg someone to the ER 1n an SUD cr1s1s, they are an 
rmportant source of mformatlon that 1s often cr1t1cal to provlders They can help g1ve 1nfonnat1on 
that 1s cruclal to unprove outcomes It 1s also an opportumty to start engagmg the famlly It 1s an 
opportumty to rmprove outcomes And th1s 1s cr1t1cal Engagmg the famlly separate from the 
person wrth SUD rmproves outcomes So, I thmk 1f you cont1nue to see 42 CFR as bamer to 
dorng anythmg dlfferent, then you w1ll not do anythmg dlfferent In sp1te of the fact that the 
sltuatlon calls for us to do somethmg dlfferent It’s l1ke that old say1ng 1n the rooms of AA “If 
nothmg changes, noth1ng changes ” TIHS b1ll 1s an opportumty to do somethrng drfferent 
I also understand that people are concemed that v1ct1ms of domest1c vrolence may be caught up 
1n th1s and be more at the mercy of thelr abuser I thlnk we can ﬁx th1s 
Here 1s one of my suggestlons to amend th1s Engagement w1th the famlly needs to start 1n the 
emergency room Famlly members should be grven rnformatlon about avallable serv1ces 
Slgnage should be v1s1ble 1n emergency rooms, wa1t1ng areas, etc People should know that they 
can ask for help I would suggest that we mvest more 1n CRAFT serv1ces CRAFT stands for 
Commumty Remforcement and Fam1ly Tra1n1ng Th1s approach 1s already belng offered ata 
l1m1ted number of locatlons 1n the state It should be expanded I have grven you a handout about 
th1s approach 
I also understand the concerns about 1ntervent1ons Let me be clear I have never seen the TV 
show or any sensat1onal1st1c dep1ct1on l1ke that I am talkmg about a fac1l1tated conversat1on wlth 
famlly members and a person w1th SUD F1rst, let me tell you about how our expenences wrth 
hosp1ta1 staff were l1ke We were yelled at We were told we had to set boundarres and 1n the 
same breath told we had to do somethmg We were told we had to set boundarres and when we 
d1d, those boundanes were blown past by hospltal staff We were told they couldn’t do anythmg, 
such as faclhtate an adm1ss1on elsewhere, even when she agreed We were ghosted the one tlmeI 
got them to arrange a fam1ly meetmg Let me contrast these w1th the ﬁrst contact we had wrth the 
person who d1d the mterventlon for us He was the ﬁrst person to ask us who Elana was He 
Dlstnct 64 Part of Watervllle and part of Wmslow
understood she had forgotten thls We were thnlled that someone ﬁnally wanted to know who 
she was That she wasn’t a collectlon of physlcal problems and symptoms He Lmderstood that 
Elana needed to know that we remembered, that we knew who she was and we mrssed her Only 
then could she agree to enter treatment She was approached w1th love, not shame She was 
acknowledged as a human belng w1th an rllness l1v1ng 1n a famrly Th1s should be the norm, not 
the exceptlon Let me be honest here I had to beg, plead and complaln to get someone to do th1s 
fac1l1tated c0nversat1on w1th my famrly It was not some sensatronalrzed TV productron It 
worked And one of my s1ster’s last acts 1n her lrfe, before the wrthdrawal serzures that ult1mately 
led to her death started, she took those letters that we had wrrtten her as part of that rnterventron 
andrput them 1n her purse to go to the ER to be admrtted for detox and then rehab 
I understand that rnterventrons are not an ev1dence-based practlce Perhaps thls 1s because of bad 
TV It 1s also true that there 1s not a separate lrcensure procedure for tlns The only state thatI 
know of that has a l1cense for th1s 1s Pennsylvama I am not suggest1ng we go down that road 
What I am suggestmg 1s that a fac1l1tated conversatron w1th a profess1ona1, perhaps tramed 1n the 
CRAFT model or w1th other experlence 1n famrly dynamrcs, 1s somethmg worthwhlle I would 
also suggest that assessmg for domestrc vrolence, abuse and other 1ssues hke th1s 1s cr1t1ca1 In 
add1t1on, a person w1th SUD should also be assessed for any co-occurnng physrcal and mental 
health condrtrons, as these can rmpact outcomes 
I would be happy to take any questrons

Gees at integrated Farnly Therapy is:         
>- 
The overall focus of family counseling in SUD treatment is on the roles, relationships, and communication 
patterns within the family system (van Wormer & Davis, 2018) Understanding these dynamics and, when 
necessary, modifying them can help family members both support an individual ’s SUD recovery, while also 
altering relational behavior patterns that could trigger future substance use Speciﬁc core ObjGCtlVeS include 
® Leveraging the family to inﬂuence change Providers should encourage family members to support Z , 
each other to increase the client’s motivation to make important lifestyle changes, including shifting away 
from substance misuse 
G lnvolving families in St! treatment Providers should create inviting, diverse, and easily accessible 
programs to engage family members in the treatment environment This might include many families 
or a single family member attending a psychoeducational activity or participating in a structured family- 
based counseling intervention Providers should also consider developing multifamily groups to take 
advantage of the support, connections, and mutually beneﬁcial effects that can come from families with 
lived experience interacting
Q 
cognitive, and emotional responses that unintentionally support the client's SUD 
9 Preventing SUDs across generations Providers should help families recognize how family patterns 
that promote SUDs can be passed from generation to generation 
Assesslng the Appreprlateness ef integrated Fainiy Qeunseng 
Before beginning family therapy, providers should screen for circumstances in which family-based 
interventions and counseling approaches would be inadvisable, inappropriate, or counterproductive Several 
factors can inﬂuence the decision to involve family members in treatment 
® ornestic vioence Joint counseling for couples in which intimate partner violence has occurred is 
generally not recommended (New York State Ofﬂce for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, 2018) 
Family members can learn how to express anger appropriately and safely via structured family 
counseling, but extreme anger or threats of violence rule out family counseling 
e Abuse Do not tnclude children, spouses, or Changing family behaviors that support SUDs Providers should help the family recognize behavioral, 
elderly family members in family sessions if 
there IS any current abuse or risk of abuse 
by family members (see box, “Mandatory 
Reporting of Abuse") 
Substance use withdraws Given the 
intensity of physical and emotional instability 
experienced by people in withdrawal, it is not 
practical to attempt integrated family counseling 
during this process® 
e Co-nccurring mental health issues Family 
counseling is gawerally appropnate for clients 1 
with SUDs and mental disorders Some 1 
family-based interventions are particularly 
effective for specific co-occurring mental Mandatory Repeating ofAbuse 
If a provider suspects a family member is abusing a 
child, spouse, or elderly family member, he or she 
should consult a supervisor immediately and follow 
agency policy and mandated reporting laws in that 
state The State Statutes Search page provided by 
the Chlidjl/Vétfafe,ll'tfOl ’t'ft8¥lOl'l G_ateway can help 
providers learn about deﬁnitions of child abuse and 
neglect and reporting requirements by state For 
information on elder abuse, providers can reference 
the National Center on Elder Abuse The National 
Coalition Against Domestic Violence maintains 
resources about intimate partner violence, including 
a link to the national hotline 
disorders, including severe adult anxiety 
disorders (Gehat, 2018)

o Significant cognitive impairment For cllents who have slgniﬁcant cognitive impairment, family 
counseling can be helpful if the cllent is not overly disruptive, is also involved in individual counseling or other 
rehabilitation treatment, and is stabllized on appropnate medicatlons as needed 
Mandated participation 
One or more family members, particuarly those with SUDs, may be mandated to treatment by the criminal 
Justice system, Child Protective Services, or an employer A provider's ﬁrst priority should be to form an 
alliance with the mandated client wlthout “taking sides” with the cllent regarding the need for treatment 
Motivational interviewing strategies can help providers build a therapeutic alllance and help the client and family 
members resolve their amblvalence about participating in family counseling (Lloyd-Hazlett et al , 2016) 
ln mandated counseling, providers should clarlfy that the primary concern is the family’s well-being, and share 
any requirements that must be followed regarding release of information to the referring organization Providers 
should inform all family members about thelr rights and responsibilities as clients, and the provider's legal and 
ethical responsibilities Providers also should have family members sign all pertinent releases as part of the 
informed consent process 
Who Participates: efining “Famly” 
It is up to clients to identify whom they would like to include in family counseling Providers should make 
their best efforts to include anyone the client thinks is signiﬁcant relatives or nonrelatives, extended family 
(e g , grandparents, a cousin), friends, signiﬁcant others, or “family of choice” (i e , supportive members of 
a community the client identiﬁes with) Providers can offer ideas about why it might be lmportant or helpful 
to include speciﬁc family members, but they should always honor the clients’ autonomy and right to decide 
for themselves what constitutes their family and decide which family members to include in treatment Once 
family is identiﬁed, providers should be prepared to address obstacles that can hinder family participation 
a> Geographc constraints Some clients have no signiﬁcant family members close enough to attend 
"family sessions in person Using secure teleconferencing or videoconferencing technology is one 
strategy for including family members in important conversations with the cllent Another is to hold longer 
family sessions (e g , 2 hours) or multiple sessions over consecutive days with family members who are 
able to travel and attend family counseling 
o Work and scheduling conflicts Overcoming work and scheduling obstacles can necessitate holding 
multiple sessions outside of normal work hours or offering phone or video consultation 
e asruptwe behavior Providers may need to exclude * " I H W 
a family member who is continually angry, blaming, or Address the impact of Stigma 
disruptive Address this issue with the family and the when Wetkmg Wtth famtttee tn SUD individual separately, and explore options for addressing that treatment, tt ts tmpet-tent to recognlze

e Refusal to attend counseling sessions: Strategies to include relatives who refuse to attend sessions 
include arranging an empty chair in the room to represent that family member and addressing the absent 
family member metaphoncally, or calling the family member who is not present during the family session (after 
securing his or her permission) to enlist his or her help in answering a question that has come up in 
the session 
Qeriiductng Appropriate Screening and Assessment 
Assessment IS an important component of any SUD treatment program Assessment moves through several 
stages that are designed to identify the client’s family resources and strengths to best position the client and 
family to achieve positive treatment outcomes 
individual assessment 
Comprehensive assessments are usually conducted at intake and are often required for an individual 
entering SUD treatment To ensure effective family involvement, the assessment should 
e Yield a thorough and accurate family history 
e Conﬁrm and clarify information about the client 
e Establish the context in which substance misuse most often occurs and in which it may have started 
or accelerated 
e Set a tone for a continuing focus on the family 
e Identify family resources to help plan long-term care 
o Document speciﬁc information that can determine treatment goals 
o Help the counsaor determine which family members should be involved 
If the client agrees to family involvement in treatment, providers should obtain privacy/con ﬁdentiality releases 
and then schedule an initial family interview 
Family interview 
Although family members may feel ambivalent about becoming involved in treatment, they are often willing 
to attend at least an initial inten/iew either individually or as a group The primary focus is to engage the 
family and begin to develop an alliance with each family member Providers can also use this initial interview 
to determine how the family functions, identify major family problems, and identify the family's perception of 
how the client’s SUD has affected the family and each member (Schumm & O‘FarrelI, 2013) Because safety 
IS paramount, providers should also make a preliminary determination of any current family violence and 
physical or sexual abuse or abuse history 
Family and strengths assessment 
Once the family is 8fCtlV9|y involved in treatment sessions, the provider has an opportunity to assess current 
family functioning, the history of SUDs over time and across generations, and the role of SUDs in the 
development of family problems (Schumm & O'Farrell, 2013) Providers can also explore the history of the 
individual ’s SUD over time, but they should always link this history to the development of family system

dynamics and functioning over time (Schumm & O’Farrel, 2013) The primary assessment task is to obsen/e 
family interactions during sessions to determine alliances and conflicts among family members, interpersonal 
boundaries, and-communication styles 
Providers can also assess the strengths of the client and all family members involved in treatment The goal 
is to identify the family’s current coping skills and abilities, family, social, and recovery-supports, motivation 
and commitments to change, and self-efﬁcacy tn other words, providers are assessing recovery capita- 
the internal and external resources that the client can draw on to begin and sustain recovery Doing so will 
give providers a baseline of family coping skills and client-centered knowledge, values, and resources to 
build on in helping the family develop a treatment and recoveiy plan lt is also cntical to maintain a strengths- 
focused lens throughout counseling to set a positive tone and enhance family members’ motivation to 
address challenging problems (Tuerk et al , 2012) 
Qptimizing initifai family counseling sessions 
After the family inten/iew and assessment process, initial family counseling sessions should focus on 
building relationships with all family members and giving each member time to share his or her frustrations, 
challenges, and hopes The identiﬁed client should always be part of family sessions The only times to 
exclude someone are if he or she is intoxicated or under the inﬂuence of drugs, has severe psychiatric 
symptoms (e g , hallucinations, suicidality, delusions, severe mania), has threatened violence, ora 
combination of these 
Initial sessions should focus on 
e-> Establishing a working relationship with members of the family 
e Orienting participants to the family counseling process 
e Continuing the assessment of how the SUD has affected each family member 
s Reframing SUDs from a character ﬂaw or moral failing to a biochemical and behavioral problem they can 
work on together to remove from their lives 
e Continuing the assessment of family strengths and strategies they have previously used to lessen the 
impact of the SUD on the family 
Q Exploring family goals and expectations for the future and each family member's ideas on~how 
counseling can help 
Addressing Gommcn Chalenges 
The following approaches can help overcome common challenges, myths, and obstacles hindering 
engagement and treatment of families 
e “Fanny counseling is secondary ” When a provider views family therapy as an add-on to individual 
or group counseling, it sends a message to clients and family members that family counseling is not 
important Providers should evaluate their attitudes about family involvement and be champions for 
integrating family-based interventions as an important part of SUD treatment 
a “Family counselng is too painful ” Although family counseling may temporanly shake up the family 
system and activate intense feelings, these feelings are a normal part of counseling A provider ’s task is to 
help the client and family members discover new ways of coping with intense emotions instead of reverting to 
old behaviors (e g , blaming and shaming the family member with the SUD)

Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT) is designed 
for married or cohabiting individuals seeking help 
for an SUD (O’Farrell & Fals-Stewart, 2006) 
BCT is a structured approach that focuses 
on improving partners ’ patterns of interaction, 
building more cohesive relationships to reduce 
risk of return to use for the partner with an SUD, 
supporting abstinence, and improving relationship 
functioning BCT has also been adapted for use 
with families (O’FarrelI et al , 2010) 
Appropriate participants are generally couples, 
with the following characteristics 
0 Partners are married or living together 
o Neither partner has a signiﬁcant co-occurring 
mental disorder 
0 Only one member has an SUD 
o There is no indication of risk of any intimate 
partner violence 
lnten/entions in BCT focus on reducing 
substance misuse and (in some cases) promoting 
abstinence in support of recovery from an SUD 
(e g , developing a recovery contract), addressing 
relationship concerns (e g , increasing positive 
activities and improving communication), and 
preventing relapse (e g , developing plans for 
continued recovery and relapse prevention) 
BCT can yield desirable treatment outcomes, 
including reductions in substance use, legal 
and family problems, and hospitalizations It 
is also linked with increased abstinence and 
treatment adherence (O’Farrell & Clements, 
2012, Rowe, 2012) Risk Reduction through Family Therapy 
(RRFT) is an integrative approach that 
addresses co-occurnng posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) symptoms (or other mental 
health problems), SUDs, and other risk 
behaviors in trauma-exposed adolescents In 
RRFT, clients intentionally recall speciﬁc 
feelings, thoughts, cues, and memories of 
traumatic experiences 
Appropriate participants are trauma-exposed 
adolescents ages 13-18 who experience 
co-occurring trauma-related mental health 
problems (e g , PTSD, depression), substance 
use problems, and other risk behaviors 
(e g , risky sexual behavior, nonsuicidal 
self-injury) and parents/caregivers RRFT IS 
individualized to each family and adolescent 
The goals of RRFT include reducing 
symptoms of trauma-related mental 
health issues, reducing substance use 
and substance use risk factors, increasing 
protective factors, improving family 
communication and cohesion, and reducing 
risk factors for revictimization 
RRFT can lead to reductions in drug use, 
drug use-related risks, PTSD symptoms, 
and sexual behaviors that increase risk for 
HIV and other sexually transmitted infections 
(Danielson et al , 2010, Danielson et al , 2012, 
Hahn et al , 2020)

Coordination of family services It is challenging to provide family-oriented case management or 
referral and coordination of services while doing family counseling, but providers can actively link 
individual family members to case management services or peer providers who can collaborate with 
them to coordinate the multiple service needs of the family It can also be helpful to connect a family with 
other persons wﬁh lived experience of recovery to help them navigate coordinated care

e Keeping famiy secrets, A provider should not hold family secrets The provider should let everyone 
know dunng the initial family interview that he or she will bring up information a family member reveals 
outside of family sessions and will do so during the next family session The only exception is if a family 
member tells the provider privately of violence or abuse that needs to be addressed separately                                                        
w SU client or family member is an precoritemplation The term “denial” has been used to describe 
people who do not see an SUD as a problem This label is judgmental, avoid-using it and let family 
members know that using labels to confront each other can lead to conﬂict or family members closing 
down emotionally Providers can also reframe “denial” as precontemplation, an indication that the family 
member is not quite ready to change 
s Fairnily ’s adjustment to abstinence Families tend to adjust to SUDs, and family members may act 
differently (and not always positively) when the client with the SUD enters recovery, as long-standing 
problems ﬁnally come to light and roles within the family realign The provider ‘s task is to help family 
members adapt to these changes, ﬁnd ways to support the client’s recovery, learn new relationship and 
coping skills, and ﬁnd healthier ways to function as a family 
o The client being treated for opioid use disorder (GU) withbuprenorphine arid methadone. 
Common myths of medication treatment for OUD include the false belief that people taking it are simply 
replacing one addiction with another, and that people cannot truly be in recovery while taking these 
medications Family members need to be educated about what medication treatment for OUD is, as well 
as its effectiveness and safety, so they can be a source of emotional and practical support for clients 
e The client on other medication When clients stop takingmedications, symptoms of mental disorders 
or previous substance use behaviors can reemerge, causing families to return to patterns of dysfunction 
The provider ’s task is to raise this issue in family sessions Once all family members have accurate 
information about the importance of medication adherence, the conversation can shift to the family’s 
working as a team to support the client in taking medication as prescribed or safely tapering off (under 
medical supen/ision and when appropriate) 
e Financiallogistcal barraers For many families or family members, ﬁnancial and/or travel resources 
may be limited Offering bus tokens, transit cards, or similar transportation incentives can help increase 
the ability of the family (or other members) to participate 
Responding te Gutural Dlfferences 
Truly comprehensive, evidence-based SUD treatment cannot be offered if the culture of the family with whom 
the provider is working is not considered Although a comprehensive discussion of culture and diversity in 
family-based treatment is beyond the scope of this Advisory, providers can consider the following steps to 
embrace cultural differences 
e Engage aspects of the family s culture or religion that promote healing 
s Consider the role that drugs and alcohol may play in the culture 
e Be ﬂexible and meet families where they are 
e Be continuously aware of and sensitive to the differences between the provider and the members of the 
group he or she is counseling 
<9 ls the family a homogeneous group or one that represents different backgrounds ’? Does the family live in 
one community or several different communities ’? Are those communities different from the one in which 
the provider lives’? These considerations and responsiveness to the speciﬁc cultural norms of the family 
in treatment must be respected from the start of counseling Family members may also identify or affiliate

10 Jour
We often recerve th1s kmd of call here at the Center for Motrvatlon & Change (CMC) It’s a temble call because ofthe angulsh lnvolved It’s alsoa 
wonderful call, because we have the tools needed to help A call l1ke th1s provrdes our CMC chmcrans the opportumty to 1nv1te the famlly member to 
lea.rn about CRAFT 
Commumty Remforcement and Famlly Tramlng, or CRAFT, 1s an approach for fam1l1es who have a loved one strugglmg w1th substances, but who 1s 
not really mterested m makmg changes or gettmg help CRAFT 1s about leamlng a drfferent method to commumcate wlth and support your loved one 
It’s about takmg care of yourself, wh1le also learnmg how to mteract wrth your loved one m a way that mcreases the hkehhood of makmg a real 
change 
The old method — elther help them, or help yourself by dlstancmg yourself from them — 1s never a cholce you should have to make CRAFT teaches 
you a senes of strategres such as 
Q Understandmg how to commumcate pos1t1vely (even when thmgs aren’t gomg so well) 
Q Usmg POSIUV6 relnforcement to focus on what 1s workmg, whrle allowmg for the bad stuff they are domg to rmpact them 
0 Takmg real steps and developmg a real awareness of what 1t means to take care of yourself, not as an afterthought, but as a pnonty for the whole 
famrly 
Parents have been told a number of thmgs that are ne1ther helpful nor practrcal, such as, “Let them lut bottom, they have to ﬁgure rt out for 
themselves, ” or, “There’s nothmg you can do, helpmg them 1s enablmg then use and means you are codependent ” These “tough love” messages are 
often excruclatmg for many parents 
The good news‘? You can help your loved one wrthout takmg those steps CRAFT works to change your mteractlons wrth your loved one so that sober 
behavlor 1s more rewardmg to them than contmued substance use 
CRAFT 1s “menu-dnven ” Th1s means that dlfferent components and procedures are selected from the CRAFT “menu” based on the fam1ly’s 
partlcular needs Where the treatment starts depends on your loved one’s behavror, seventy and openness to change It also depends on your emotronal 
state, expenence and hlstory as a famrly 
CRAFT research, as well as our clmlcal expenence, have demonstrated that by learmng skrlls and understandlng what motrvates your Ohlld, pos1t1ve 
change can occur Evldence shows that posrtrve outcomes occur at a much hlgher rate w1th the CRAFT approach than wtth other, more well-known 
approaches, such as 12-Step programs or Interventron approaches 
Why‘? Probably because CRAFT 1s posltlve, armed at encouragrng healthy, constructrve changes, and focused on helpmg your clnld develop, or re- 
develop, a l1fe In add1t1on, CRAFT 1s a behavroral approach, rnterested m changmg behavlors — thelrs and yours — 1'10i_]l1Stl§ll(1l1g about them And, 
as We mentloned, 1t 1s geared toward lmprovmg your l1fe, too Research studles repeatedly ﬁnd that famlly members feel much better throughout the 
CRAFT process, whether or not therr loved one ultlmately gets 1nto treatment Best of all, usmg the CRAFT approach, the person wrth addlctlon seeks 
treatment at a rate of about 65-75%, wh1ch 1s 2-3 tlmes hlgher than mterventlons or l2-step approaches 
CRAFT works It may requrre work, practrce, stumbles, practlce and more practrce — but CRAFT also teaches you that you can help 
Perhaps most lmportantly, the skrlls, strategles and 1ns1ght you gam through CRAFT are bu1lt for the long haul what you leam now w1ll remam 
apphcable beyond your current s1tI.1at1on, the skrlls are not Just useful when “tryrng to get hrm to say yes to treatment ” Saymg yes matters, but what 
matters more are the changes you can make 1n your famlly, because these changes are the ones that provrde the fuel for last1ng change — not _|ust for 
puttmg out the lmmedlate ﬁre

Through Commumty Remforcement and Famrly Trammg (CRAFT), famrly members motrvate loved ones to seek help for addrctton
