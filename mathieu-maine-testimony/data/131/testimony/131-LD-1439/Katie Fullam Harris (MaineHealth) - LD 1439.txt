“An Act to Promote Famlly-centered Interventlons for Substance Use D1sorder Treatment ” 
May s, 2023 
Senator Baldaccl, Representauve Meyer and members of the ]o1nt Standmg CO1'nIn1tt66 on Health and 
Human Serv1ces, I am Kane Fullam Harns of Ma1neHealth Thrs brll presents an understandable but 
unworkable solut1on to the very challengmg problem of gettlng help and treatment for 1nd1v1duals w1th 
substance use d1SOId€I 
There 1s no question that famllles who lnclude members wlth substance use Cl1SOId€1‘ face 1ncred1ble 
challenges and frustrauon as they try to navrgate the system on behalf of thelr loved ones Indlvlduals w1th 
substance use drsorder may agree to treatment at one moment, but walk away from 1t the next Treatment 1s 
not always reacltly avarlable, and parucularly for those who are on MameCare or umnsured And mdlvlduals 
wlth substance use dlsorder may be techrncally mcompetent when they are under the lnﬂuence, but fully 
competent to make the1r own dec1s1ons when the substances have worn off 
Importantly, health care prov1ders cannot compel someone to enter treatment We can offer resources, we 
can encourage par11c1pat1on 1n treatment, but we cannot force someone to enter treatment agamst the1r w1ll 
As an as1de, even 1f we could compel treatment, experts are clear that the greatest success occurs when 
1nd1v1duals make a dec1s1on to enter treatment for themselves 
Thls brll would requrre hospltals to play a role 1n trymg to compel treatrnent for an 1nd1v1dual w1th substance 
use Cl1SOIClCI by requmng that we lead rnterven ﬂons W/1th the l.l.tn11ICd excepuon of patlents who are undera 
court-ordered status such as blue-paper or protectlve custody, patients at hospltals are there of thelt own 
free w1]l As med1cal prov1ders, we can and do encourage them to part1c1pate 1n appropr1ate treatment 
regimens, however, pat1ents have the opnon of leavmg Agamst Med1calAdv1ce We cannot compel panents

However, Ma1neHealth ’s hosp1ta1s do a great deal to encourage pauents to get the help they need 
Spec1ﬁcal1y, we have bmlt systems to engage pat1ents who have SUD and come to the ED or to our 
lnpatlent units

NOTE THIS IS AN AREA OF SIGNFICANT GAP IN MAINE We do not have nearly enough detox

@ Once patients are stable, the ED teams work hard to engage them in treatment They refer 
patients to our substance use peer counselors, they make appointments at substance use 
treatment programs, they encourage them to work with their support systems to engage in 
treatment 
@ Families who are seeking support with their loved ones are included in the care plan as far as 
confidentiality permits We are able to access all collateral sources in properly evaluating for acute and 
imminent safety risk, however, in order to incorporate family into a discharge safety plan, the patient 
must be voluntary 
e Patients complete a comprehensive safety and discharge plan with an ED crisis provider upon discharge 
from the EDs All recommendations, referrals and sen/ice connections are documented on the pat|ent's 
plan and a copy provided to them upon discharge 
o Wherever possible we also include family in these care plans and in the coordination of services 
(and lethal means restriction) in order to support the patient and bolster treatment compliance 
and follow-through 
o We strongly recommend family involvement and engagement to the patient. 
o Patients and families are educated on substance use resources and how to access these 
resources should they wish to pursue additional options following discharge 
o PeerRecovery Coaches are engaged in every possible discharge plan 
o Hotléne/helpline numbers are provided to patients for access from the community 24/7 
In add111on, famihes Will often contact our ED teams for support w1th accesslng care for the1r loved one(s) 
In these mstances, we prov1de educauon on available opuons, supporttve measures that can be taken and 
the lirmts of tI€2.1'11‘1ﬂ1t and HIPAA 
We cannot coerce pat1ents mto care, however, express recommendauons and reﬂect r1sk proﬁles to pauents 
1.11 supporting rauonale for 1nd1cated treatment, includmg famrly members 1n the1r treatment plans 
Fmally, Mame Medrcal Center’s Emergency Department and Mame Behav1oral Healthcare are part of an 
NIH study on op1o1d use Cl1SOId€t The ED engages pat1ents m early treatment and the MBH hub provrdes 
early access to ongolng therapy and treatment We have the third hlghest number of pauents enrolled 1n the 
study, and 1t 1s proving very effecuve' " e -w I =~
