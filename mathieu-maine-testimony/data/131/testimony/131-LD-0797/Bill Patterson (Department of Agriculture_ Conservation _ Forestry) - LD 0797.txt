The bill directs DACF to convey Nonreserv_ed'Publifc Land presently leased to CARA and used 
forcommunity recreation. The parcel is located.along_Piggery Road in Augusta, and LD 797 _i
s 
directs ‘DACF toconvey the lease parcel to CARA: _without covenant for_$1 . :_The lease parcel is 
currently comprised of -athletic ‘ playing "ﬁelds and other outdoor public recreation facilities, "and it 
is the.subject of a~l00’ -year lease dated-Januaryil, 1993, between. DACF and CARA. -DACF 
commends CARA for its long track record asian excellent steward of this land, -noting that .»‘ 
extensive effort has been put into developing playing ﬁelds for many sports and recreational 
activities that_bene ﬁt20 communities in the Augusta area, There: is merit in giving CARAa 
greater degree of autonomy to manage the _ site, which-would also reduce occasional demands , on 
Departmentstaff , to monitor use toirrespond-to new proposals for the facility from- CARA. '“ 
As the Committee reviews this bill, there are several factors to consider; .First,~public vlandhas-

circumstances and at a- price commensurate with the -level of restrictions placed on the parcel. I 
can provide, for your consideration, multiple examples of land‘ sales approved by the Legislature 
overthe decades that range fro,mhighly' encumber _ed at-little or no cost to completely unrestricted 
at appraised fair market value. Itjis appropriate for the Committee to consider the question of ,.- 
conveying public lands in relation to encumbrance1and.co ‘st,i Concerningpotential restrictions, _. 
DACF recommends amending LD 797 to require the land be kept‘ in ‘non-proﬁt, public _ , *

CARA, it would be offered to the City of Augusta with the same restrictions. Furthermore, 
should the City of Augusta decline to accept the parcel, LD 797 should require that the parcel 
revert to DACF. M g. 
Second, LD 797 references Piggery Road, which runs parallel to and south of the lease parcel. 
However, the road is not directly included in the lease. ' 
In discussion with the CARA boardA 
members, as well as staff at the adjacent Viles Arboretum (which is also on land under lease 
from DACF), DACF recommends that if LD 797 moves forward, it should be amended to - 
include the conveyance of Piggery Road to CARA. Such a conveyance should be subject to the 
delineation of a boundary mutually agreed upon by CARA and DACF with input from the Viles 
Arboretum, which has rights to the road through its existing lease. ‘The sale of land should 
include Piggery Road to its eastem extent where it intersects with a portion of that road conveyed 
by DACF to the Department of Motor Vehicles in 1991; this will need to be identiﬁed as part of 
a survey of the entire parcel. Au

Thiid, DACF recommends that LD 797 befurther amended to require CARA to pay all , 
conveyance costs, including survey and DACF legal costs. 
Thank you for your consideration of this information. I would be glad to answer anypquestions at 
this time. I will also be glad to bring to the work session speciﬁc deed restriction language, in 
consultation with CARA, that ensures public access in perpetuity and addresses appropriate 
recreational uses on the property. _ .-
