_ ;- 
_ Public Hearing: March 13, 2023 . 
Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker and ‘Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture Conservation and Forestry. I am Senator Matt Pouliot and l represent Senate District 
15, which includes the towns of Augusta, Belgrade, China, Mount Vernon, Sidney and 
Vassalboro. I am testifying in support of LD 797, “Resolve, to Authorize the Conveyance of 
Real Property to the Capitol Area Recreation Association?' 
The Capitol Area Recreation Association would like for the State to convey this land to themso 
that they can make improvements to the property which will help with their long term goals,‘ 
which others will discuss today. A 
The city of Augusta has been very fortunate to have the Capitol Area Recreation Association to 
maintain fields and provide opportunities for both young and old alike who want to play sports 
and participate in outdoor activities. I was fortunate to be able to use this facility as a kid, 
playing countless baseball games there through the years. 
The CARA complex is a real gem in our community, but it can be made even better. I 
encourage this committee to support this resolve and allow the Capitol Area Recreation 
Association to move forward with improving this tremendous asset to provide greater 
opportunities to the residents of central Maine. 
Thank you.‘
