TESTIMONY NEITHER FO R NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 1510  
 
AN ACT TO PROVIDE GR ANTS TO PROMOTE  
INNOVATIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee. I am Eileen King, executive director of the Maine School Super-
intendents Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine 
School Superintendents Association, neither for nor against L.D. 1510.  
 
Innovation in classroom learning encompasses a variety of instructional strategies 
aimed at increasing student engagement, developing creativity, encouraging collabo-
ration, and deepening understanding through the use of real -world issues.  
 
In awarding grants, the department shall give special consideration to school admin-
istrative units that demonstrate instructional partnerships with professional organiza-
tions or companies and partnerships with institutions of higher education that provide 
specific data on closing the achievement gap for economically disadvantaged stu-
dents, racial and ethnic populations and students whose learning achievements were 
negatively affected due to restrictions during the pandemic related to coronavirus dis-
ease 2019, referred to as COVID -19.  
 
MSSA is neither for nor against L.D. 1510. We completely support the promotion of 
innovative learning strategies in Maine ’s classrooms because we know that students 
learn best when their learning is relevant and meaningful. We are concerned that 
school units that already demonstrate instructional partnerships will receive special 
consideration for these funds. Perhaps the funds from this grant could be used to as-
sist school districts across the state to establish these partnerships making the grant 
accessible to all school districts in Maine.
