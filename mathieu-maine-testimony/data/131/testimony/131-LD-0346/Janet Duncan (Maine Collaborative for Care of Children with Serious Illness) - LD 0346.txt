Janet Duncan
Maine Collaborative for Care of Children with Serious Illness
LD 346
I am Janet Duncan MSN, CPNP –a retired Pediatric Palliative Care Nurse Practitioner  
This is a typical child patient that I helped care for.
The child has a rare disease diagnosed at age 4 that has caused her to lose function slowly. 
She has a g-tube for feeds and medications 4x/day.. She needs help with all of her activities 
of daily living- dressing, toileting, walking. She attends school when she is feeling well but 
does require assistance about 3 hours in the morning and 5 hours in the evening. Sometimes 
she sleeps through the night. Many nights she needs reassurance, a diaper change or an 
intervention to relieve discomfort. When she is sick or when a classmate has a potentially 
contagious virus, this child must stay at home to protect her or for increased medications or 
interventions like breathing treatments. 
My main concern
Her mother worked as long as she could when she had a few reliable health care workers for 
her but then it became impossible. The shortage is real, there simply are not health care 
workers to hire. They also call out sick, or find a better job, or want a better schedule. Even 
when her daughter goes to school- there are professional days or a snow days or vacations. 
She worries that the family may lose their house never mind not being able to pay for a ramp 
to help with access for her daughter's wheelchair, or supplies like braces or equipment 
sometimes not covered by insurance or medication co-pays.  
What we need
We need to find a way to reimburse parents who work around the clock as their child’s nurse, 
case manager, therapist, aide, advocate, and 24/7 caregiver. Please support LD 346.
