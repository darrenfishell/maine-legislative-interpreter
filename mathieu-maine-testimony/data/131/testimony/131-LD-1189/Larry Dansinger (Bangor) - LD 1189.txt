LD 1189
April 9, 2023
To members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety of the Maine 
legislature:
I am writing in support of LD 1189, “An Act to Amend the Burden of Proof for 
Defendants Who Cannot Pay Criminal Restitution.”
Sadly, there are people in Maine who do not have anywhere near the income and 
financial wherewithal to meet their basic needs—housing, food, clothing, healthcare, 
etc. In some cases, they are charged with and convicted of crimes, often because of 
their lack of resources, including payment of restitution. 
This bill simply gives the legal system the option and flexibility of not requiring a 
person who has essentially no resources and income to have to pay restitution. In most
cases, a person can afford a small amount—such as $10/week—but there may be a 
few who cannot even do that. For those few individuals, being able to get out from 
under years, possibly even decades, of payments would enable them to start over and 
not be saddled with payments they can’t make for an unforeseeable future. 
Please vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1189.
Sincerely, 
Larry Dansinger
