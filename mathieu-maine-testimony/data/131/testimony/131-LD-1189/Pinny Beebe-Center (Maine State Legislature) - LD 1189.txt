Testimony of Senator Pinny Beebe-Center introducing 
LD 1189, “An Act to Amend the Burden of Proof for Defendants Who Cannot Pay Criminal 
Restitution ” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
April 10, 2023 
Good aftemoon, Representative Salisbury and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. I am Senator Pinny Beebe-Center, and I represent all of Knox 
County, except for Isle Au Haut and the town of Washington. I am here today to present LD I190, “An 
Act to Amend the Burden of Proof for Defendants Who Cannot Pay Criminal Restitution. ” 
This bill will allow judges to change or terminate a restitution order of the defendant provides evidence 
that they are unable to make restitution. This would only apply if the defendant has met the burden of 
proof that they are unable to make restitution, which is especially prominent when the defendant 
undergoes a signiﬁcant unforeseen circumstance, such as illness, injury, loss of job, etc. 
This legislation provides a way to help criminal defendants who have entered into restitution plans with 
the best of intentions. Disaster can strike anyone at any time, and unforeseen circumstances can derail the 
plans of even the most diligent planners. Allowing some ﬂexibility would provide some much needed 
relief. II 
I thank you for your time and consideration. I invite you to direct your questions to Walter McKee of the 
Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
