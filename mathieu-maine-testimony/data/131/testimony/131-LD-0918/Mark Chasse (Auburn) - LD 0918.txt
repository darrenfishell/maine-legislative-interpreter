LD 918
REALLY??? LD 918 ought-NOT-to-pass as my assumption is this recommendation 
is based on the lack of available bus drivers. So yeah, let's just lower the safety 
standards - NOT! 
At the very least you owe it to the public to make them aware - in no uncertain terms -
what this legislation may mean to the possible impact to safety if their children.
Thank you
