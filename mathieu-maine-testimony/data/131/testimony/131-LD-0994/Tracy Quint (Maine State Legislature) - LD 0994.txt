Tracy Quint@legislature.maine.gov 
Good afternoon Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and 
distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. My name is 
Tracy Quint and I represent House District 8 which is comprised of 47 communities in 
Aroostook, Washington, and Penobscot counties. I thank you for taking the time to allow 
me to introduce LD 994, “An Act to Include Possession of Compounds, Mixtures or 
Substances Containing a Detectable Amount of Certain Scheduled Drugs to Prove the 
Offense of Unlawful Trafﬁcking of Scheduled Drugs” and LD 1545, "An Act to Reduce 
Drug Overdoses and Death by Expanding the Crime of Aggravated Trafficking of 
Scheduled Drugs by Including Compounds, Mixtures or Substances ”. 
Like so many of you, communities in my district have experienced the 
devastation of the consequences of drug addiction, drug overdoses, and death. There are 
empty chairs at dining room tables during the holidays that will never be ﬁlled again. The 
opportunity to hug a loved one is gone forever. The vicious cycle of addiction tears 
families apart and these bill titles do not begin to describe the damage the drug trade is 
inflicting on our communities. These losses must not continue. Drug overdoses leading to 
death or serious injury are an unbearable burden on Maine, claiming far too many lives. 
Any effective public safety policy to reduce drug abuse, overdose and death must include 
elements of education to reduce demand, treatment to save individuals from the trap of 
addiction, and enforcement to reduce supply and availability and to deter those proﬁting 
from misery. 
Without these three legs, Maine’s drug policy has no stability, and will fall. Many 
bills coming forward address education and treatment. These are comfortable, more 
palatable bills. We all know victims of addiction and we desire for them to be free from 
the evil hold of addiction. But, there are also those who victimize others and provide the 
deadly, destructive supply. As a part of the solution, I offer for your consideration LD 
994 and LD 1545. These two bills help support and strengthen that uncomfortable third 
leg, enforcement, which supports the stability of the public effort as a whole by reducing 
the supply and getting those who provide the supply away from our children and 
communities. 
Maine’s drug laws identify drugs as falling into certain ‘schedules ’ , with schedule 
W being the most serious, including drugs such as LSD, methamphetamine, heroin, crack 
cocaine, and fentanyl, among others. Maine’s foundation drug trafficking law, 17A- 
1103, Unlawful Traﬁicking in Scheduled Drugs is structured as a law that identiﬁes 
selling schedule W drugs for money, or in trade for other items of value, as a serious 
crime, a Class B felony. . 
Maine’s enhanced and more serious drug trafficking law, 17A-1 105—A, 
Aggravated Trafficking of Scheduled Drugs is structured as a law that includes the 
elements of the trafficking law, but creates a crime that is aggravated, or even more 
serious in nature- a Class A felony crime. Aggravated T raﬂicking involves larger 
House District 8
quantities of drugs, situations where the perpetrator possesses a ﬁrearm to further the 
crime, conducts the activity in a school zone, peddles drugs to minors, or has a prior 
conviction of drug trafﬁcking. These bills, LD 994 and LD 1545, add possession of 
compounds, mixtures or substances containing detectable amounts of certain Schedule W 
drugs to the weights that juries are allowed to presume that a person is unlawfully 
trafficking in them. 
An element of 17 a-1 1 03 T raﬂicking, paragraph 3., reads: “Proof that the person 
intentionally or knowingly possesses any scheduled drug that is in fact of a quantity, state 
or concentration as provided in this subsection, gives rise to a permissible inference under 
the Maine Rules of Evidence, Rule 303 that the person is unlawfully trafficking in 
scheduled drugs.” That statement is followed in the T raﬂicking law by speciﬁc drug 
threshold weights that allow a jury to infer guilt based on evidence and reasoning, that the 
person possessing that quantity of drug, or greater, is involved in its trafﬁcking. That 
permissible inference allows that a juror may conclude if that speciﬁed quantity of that 
drug was knowingly and intentionally possessed, the possessor intended to sell it. 
An analogy of this would be if someone had a brand new Ford in their driveway, 
it’s reasonable to infer that the Ford was intended for personal use. However, if the 
person had ﬁfty identical brand new Fords in the driveway, it would be reasonable to 
infer that the person was involved in a commercial venture involving them. Jurors are 
only permitted to make this inference, not forced to. Additional evidence could be 
introduced to support that conclusion, that inference. This could include advertising, a 
sign, or interviews with customers, etc. That inference could also be debunked, however, 
with additional and credible evidence that the person had agreed to use his driveway as 
an overﬂow lot for a local dealership, or had won the lottery and was a very impulsive 
spender. 
The permissible inference threshold amounts of Schedule W drugs deﬁned in 
Trafficking and Aggravated Trafficking are far more than end-user amounts, and vary by 
the type of drug. Paragraph B. of T raﬂicking deﬁnes that amount as Fourteen grams or 
more of cocaine or cocaine base. Paragraph D of Aggravated T raﬁicking defines that 
amount as 112 grams. Powder cocaine is typically purchased in what is known as an 
“eight ball” , an eighth of an ounce or 3.54 grams, in a bindle about the size of the 
diameter of a quarter. Fourteen grams represents almost a half-ounce of cocaine, ora 
little less than four “eight balls.” One hundred and twelve grams is 31.6 “eight balls.” 
For cocaine base, or crack, fourteen grams represents about 56 individual “rocks” 
weighing .25 grams each. One hundred and twelve grams of crack, for Aggravated 
T raﬂicking, represents about 448 rocks. 
T raﬂicking’s paragraph C-1 identiﬁes Four grams or more of heroin, and C-2 identiﬁes 
F our grams or more of fentanyl powder as threshold trafﬁcking amounts. Heroin and 
fentanyl are sold to the end-user, typically, in .1 gram amounts in individually-packaged 
single-use wax or glassine baggies known as “tickets” . Four grams of heroin or fentanyl 
represents 40 dosage units. Six grams for Aggravated T raﬂicking represents 60 dosage 
units. 
T raﬁ‘icking’s paragraph E. identiﬁes Fourteen grams or more of methamphetamine; 
Methamphetamine is typically sold in .1 gram amounts to end users, and fourteen grams 
represents 140 dosage units. One hundred grams for Aggravated Traﬂicking represents 
one thousand dosage units. 
Trafﬁcking’s paragraph H. identiﬁes Fourteen grams or more of or 30 or more pills, 
capsules, tablets or units containing 3, 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA, or 
any other drug listed in section 1102, subsection J, paragraph O or P. MDMA is 
typically sold in pill form, and the fourteen gram number allows the pill’s binder to be 
included as part of the weight. 
House District 8
These threshold amounts, dmg weights or packaging counts that allow a jury to infera 
person is trafﬁcking, are part of existing law in Maine, and not a change. 
Without these bills, the problem found in the ﬁeld with enforcing these drug 
amounts as permissible inferences is that these drugs are often sold on the street as 
mixtures, having been blended with other substances to “cut” or “step on” them to stretch 
the drug into additional weight and as a result create increased proﬁts for the dealer, like 
a bar that waters down drinks. The problem is these drugs can be ﬁeld-tested as 
containing heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, or methamphetamine, but the Wei ght seized is not 
all heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, or methamphetamine, and an extensive potency test, 
conducted in a laboratory, needs to be conducted to determine the actual net weight of 
pure heroin, pure fentanyl, pure cocaine, or pure methamphetamine in the seized gross 
weight of the seizure. This takes time, often months, and as a result, drug traffickers are 
unable to be immediately charged as traffickers, merely possessors, until the lab report is 
available. In the meantime, they are free to continue to poison Mainers for proﬁt. 
These bills add possession of compounds, mixtures or substances containing a 
detectable amount of heroin, fentanyl, cocaine and cocaine base, methamphetamine, or 
MDMA, language already in place in Maine law for Oxycodone, Hydromorphone, and 
LSD, to the threshold weights of these Schedule W drugs already in statute asa 
permissible inference that a person is unlawfully trafficking in scheduled drugs. It isa 
simple, common-sense change that would create consistency in Maine law and speed and 
simplify its enforcement, without changing the spirit of existing statute. 
I have had constituents reach out telling me of the havoc that drugs have brought into 
their lives and homes. Healthcare workers and emergency responders are overburdened. 
There are those who seek to decriminalize drugs in the guise of compassion for the 
addicted. But, what happens when large quantities of drugs are available for use and 
distribution? I ask, would we rather see a loved one in jail with the opportunity for 
recovery or rather receive a phone call from law enforcement asking us to identify the 
body of yet another overdose victim? That is not compassion. That is a tragedy! 
These bills are slight modiﬁcations of existing drug trafficking and aggravated trafficking 
laws, using language that is already applied to some drugs, such as LSD, that will allow 
prosecutors to use gross weights of seized drugs to charge drug trafﬁcking and 
aggravated trafficking. 
I truly appreciate your consideration of this bill for its merits as a way forward to 
assist in reducing dmg deaths and overdoses in Maine. I close, saying with conviction, 
that every day that drug traffickers are allowed to proﬁt from misery and poison and kill 
Mainers through drug overdoses, is a missed opportunity to save a user’s life. We have 
the opportunity to protect fragile and vulnerable Mainers from those Wl1O would prey 
upon their desperation by making these drugs less available. We must address this crisis 
from every angle and keep trafﬁckers ﬁom adding new addicts to our already 
overburdened, overwhelmed, and heart-broken communities. 
Sincerely 
State Representative
