JOINT STANDING COMIVIITTEE ON 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY 
April 18, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety, greetings. My name is Michael 
Kebede, and I am the Policy Counsel at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committedV 
to advancing and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. 
Constitutions. On behalf of our members, we urge you to reject both these bills. 
First, these bills are largely duplicative of existing law. Second, to the extent that they are 
not duplicative, these bills expand the state’s already enormous power in prosecuting drug 
crimes. Under current law, if a prosecutor establishes that someone “intentionally or knowingly 
possesses [speciﬁed quantities of] any scheduled drug,” then the law allows “a pennissible 
inference under [Rule 303] of the Maine Rules of Evidence that the person is unlawfully 
trafficking in scheduled drugs.” 17-A MRS §l103(3). This law allows prosecutors to cut comers 
when seeking a drug trafﬁcking conviction by saving them from having to prove to a judge or 
7 jury that the accused even sold any drugs. As long as the prosecutor proves that the accused
' 
possessed four grams of heroin, or fourteen grams of cocaine, or more than one pound of 
cannabis, then the accused is assumed — without any evidence — to be unlawfully trafficking in 
that substance. See id. Current law is already absurd enough, since it gives the state the power to. 
punish people for things that might have never happened. The bills before you would further
1
undermine some of the most basic principles of our legal system, including the principle of 
“innocent until proven guilty,” and enlarge an already enormous state power. 
If enacted, these bills Would add to the drug trafficking sections of the criminal code What 
already exists in deﬁnitions sections of the criminal code. Maine’s criminal code deﬁnes cocaine, 
heroin, fentanyl,_-and numerous other drugs as “any compound, mixture or preparation, in 
granular or powder form, containing [the drug] in any quantity. ” See 17-A MRS §§l l01(24), 
1101(25)(B), 110l(26), l102(l)(I), l' 
l02(3)(K). For some drugs (i.e., cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, 
and other narcotics), these bills would merely re-codify the rule under which you are presumed 
to be trafﬁcking the total Weight, not the fractional quantity, of the banned drug. For other drugs 
(i.e., methamphetamine or amphetamine, 3, 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA, and 
thirteen other drugs listed in 17-A MRS 1l02(l)(O)), these bills expand the rule that treats ﬁllers 
that drugs are mixed with (e.g., flour or baking soda) as part of the weight of the drug. 
These bills would bring about an unnecessary and harmful expansion of Maine’s drug 
laws. They would, of course, make prosecutors ’ jobs easier, but at a vast cost to jails and prisons 
and, more importantly, to the lives of people with substance use disorders. The War on Drugs, 
which these bills would strengthen, has worsened drug-related violence and deaths;1 - 
made the 
drug market more violent by driving it underground;2 and exacerbated the overdose epidemic by 
leaving drug users with no guarantee of the safety or purity of drugs.3 People in poverty, 
especially poor people of color, have been much likelier than the rest of the population to be 
arrested and convicted for drug use, possession, and sale. As a consequence, people of color 
shoulder a vastly disproportionate burden of records for drug crimes. In Maine, Black people

If enacted, these bills would worsen the crisis of drug-related hann and death. They 
would also undermine the presumption of innocence by enabling convictions for larger dmg 
quantities than the accused possessed or sold. We urge you to vote ought not to pass.
