RE: LD 1462  “An Act to Provide  Financial I ncentives for Attorneys to Provide 
Indigent Legal Services. ” 
Dear Senator Carney , Representativ e Moonen , and Members of the Committee on 
Judiciary : 
MACDL supports  LD 1462. 
This committ ee received significant inpu t in this session and prior  sessio ns about the 
extreme shortage of criminal  defense attorneys for Maine ’s indigent defendants. Chief 
Justice S tanfill and other Judicial Branch staff as well as MCILS Commissioner  Andrus 
and Chair  Tardy have al l testified  about  the need for more attorneys to represent indigent 
defendant s in Maine. The need for qualified  defense attorneys to represent indi gent 
defendants in Maine is one of the most important  challenges facing Maine ’s justice 
system.  
LD 1462 is one more step —in addition to the imp ortan t work this committee  has already 
done increasing  the hou rly rate —toward achieving  parity between defense attorneys 
working for Maine and its many other public em ployees, including prosecutors. LD 1462 
provides an interest -free loan and t ax incentives for  Maine law students willing to commit  
to full- time indigent defense work. This kind of investment  in the future of public  defense 
in Maine is critical to assuring the long-term health of M aine’s criminal justice system.  
For these reasons, MACDL supports  LD 1462 . 
 
                 
Sincerely ,     
 
/s/ Matthew Morgan
