LD 1359
Dear Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China Village, Maine. I am writing today to
ask you to support LD 1359.
This impacts me because I see how dehumanizing prison can be in my own family 
and with the people my family works with. Prison is punishment and our youth don't 
deserve a life of punishment without rehabilitation.  This is where resentencing comes
in, which I believe could add more humanity back to our systems.  People aren't born 
evil or born thinking they're going to commit irredeemable crimes- that's learned by 
the society they grow up in and if our society failed to teach them another way- then 
we are to blame- not them. We need to take responsibility to fix the systems that put 
them there and give them a light at the end of the tunnel - that reminds them of their 
humanity and gives them hope. There's still more work to do in transforming our 
prisons, but I believe this is a good first step.  This would help give hope to youth that
was never there before. This would help save lives. and we cannot afford to live in a 
world where our youth see no light at the end of the tunnel. This is why you should 
support LD 1359. 
Thank you for your time.
