L.D. 951 —AN ACT TO AMEND THE STATE EDUCATION FUNDIN G FORMULA TO CREATE 
EQUITY BETWEEN MUNICIP ALITIES BY ADDING MEDIAN INCOME TO THE FORMULA  
 
Senato r Rafferty, Representative  Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.  I 
am Eileen King , deputy  executive director of Maine School Manag emen t Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School  Board s Association and Maine Sc hool Superintendents 
Association , neither for nor against  L.D. 1160, L.D. 1402 , and L.D. 951. 
 
The structure of the Essential Programs and Services funding model , while well intentioned,  has promoted a 
continued gr owth in inequitable educational opp ortunit ies and disparities in resources acros s Maine’s sc hool 
districts. One only needs to visit schools across the state to see the differences in resources available to 
educate our children. The regional i ndex  that varies depending on where a school is located geographically 
does not consider that  school dist ricts will incur the same costs for textbooks, electricity,  and a school bus. 
One Superintendent said it best: Our district is getting 89 cents on th e dollar, and th e district 20 miles down 
the roa d is getti ng 1.10, but a box of crayons cost the same.  The EP S funding formula is tricky and when 
changes are made to one part of the  formula , it impacts another part of the formula. Inevitably , two columns 
immed iately appea r defining the winners and losers.  
 
L.D. 1160 directs the Department of Education to conduct a study on the equity of the state education subsidy 
formula. We support and applaud this effort . 
 
L.D. 1402 calls  for an additional allocation of school funding a s it relates to the amount of tax-exempt 
property a town may have.  
 
L.D. 951 pro poses to amend the calculation used in determ ining a municipalit y’s ability to pay for education 
to include median income , and that it would be given an equal weight  to valuati on. 
 
While we support incre ased funding fo r school districts across the state, a change  here or there to the Essential 
Programs and Services model will not address the inequities in funding  that have grown over the ye ars. At the 
end of the day, we ask, whe re doe s the money come from ? Will one chan ge in the funding formula impact 
another part  of the funding formula and in the end, who will win and who will lose  and what impact will the 
next change create?  
 
 Almost 20 yea rs ago, Maine implemented the Essential  Programs and Services mode l. Today, Maine  school 
districts are addressing budgetary ch allenges because of increase d valuation  and a loss of economically 
disadvantaged subsidy, due to changes that were not present 20 years ago. We continue to leave million s of 
dollars o n the table  that should be g oing to support students due to the structure  of and the challenges districts 
face in obtaining Medicaid reimburse ment . 
 
We welcome a statewide discussion  to look at how our s chools are funded, with a focus on how to fun d our 
school distric ts equitably acr oss the state but are neither for nor against  isolated changes to our funding 
formula.
