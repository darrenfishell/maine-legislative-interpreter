LD 951
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the ECA,
I represent no agency or entity and am writing in support of LD951.
Median household income should be considered when proportioning contributions 
from local communities toward a consolidated school service. This should more 
effectively compensate for Tree Growth program usage and an aging demographic 
without children and on fixed incomes.
I urge the committee to move LD951 forward with an OUGHT TO PASS vote.
Thank you.
Dan
