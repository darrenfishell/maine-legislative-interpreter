LD 951 - An Act to Amend the State Education Funding Formula to Create Equity Between 
Municipalities by Adding Median Income to the Formula  
 
April 12 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational and Cultural Affairs Committee , my name is Rebecca Lambert and I am providing testimony neither for nor against   
LD 951 on behalf of Maine Municipal  Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.   
 Municipalities across Maine are feeling the pressure from  the increasing costs of funding education. The 
current formula undoubtedly needs  reform and is becoming inequitable when considering that income 
has not risen at the recent rate of inflation. Likewise, real estate valuations significantly increased during 
COVID which has affected the outcome of the funding formula .  
 
Local leaders agree that adding another variable to the equation, so that median income and valuation 
are weighted equally, would help to address the funding challenge s that have resulted from higher 
valuation s.  
 
With that said, municipal officials recognize that market appreciation is a major driver to the funding 
challenges and have expressed concern that this proposal has the potential to drastically affect 
communities disproportionately.  
 
For these reasons the LPC  is neither for nor against LD 951. T hank you for your time and for considering 
the municipal perspective on this issue.
