Senator Rafferty , Representative Brenna n, and Distinguished Members of the Educ ation and 
Cultural Affairs Committee: 
LD 951, An Act to Amend the State Education Funding Formula to Crea te Equity Between 
Municipalities by Addin g Median Income to the Formula, proposes to amend the Essential 
Programs and Services (EPS ) funding formula so that median income is introduced into the 
formula and land valuation and median inc ome are given the same weight for the distribution of 
state and local share in the calculati on. The cost-dr iven EPS funding formula is outlined in Title 
20-A,  Chapter 606-B. The funding methodology of the educational cost components must be 
established based on available researc h.  Further, the review cyc le for formula components is 
outlined in Title 20-A, Chapter 606-B ยง15686-A.
While the Department of Education is in support of considering alternative metrics for 
distributing the local and state share of educational costs, it is not certain that the specified data 
in this bill would delive r more equity.  Including median income to the EPS funding formula 
would introduce a new component to the formula that would need to be vetted for 
appropriateness and accuracy of the data, whether it shoul d have equal weighting, and the results 
garnered from using the data. A proper analysis would require additional staff and time. 
Data accuracy is necessary for the EPS formula to be successful.  One question the Department 
has is where the land valuation and median income data comes fr om. If the data is self-reported, 
the Departme nt could not be sure how much of a given dataset mig ht contain err ors for a given 
area. There could be value, however, in accessing Maine income da ta from the Maine Revenue 
Service directly.  Additionally, economic events can happe n at any time, and often with little 
warning to allow for planning. For instance , a closing mill or starting a call center and would not 
be captured within the data for some time. 
It is also important to note the interconnectedness of EPS funding formula components. 
Individual component adjustments to the EPS formula always have positive and negative impacts 
on school administrative units (SAUs). Given the finite amount of funding, a calculation to 
increase one se gment will necessarily decrease another segment. It would be prudent to examine

any one element in the context of a comprehensive study.  In order to make equitable decisions 
that cause the least harm to our SAUs, the Department will need to dedicate time and resources 
to analyze the implications of any change.  Rega rdless of the source of the data, the Department 
would need adequate time to apply and appropriately understand the shifts that may occur with 
this specified data set. Analysis of the additional data and the weight to property valuation would 
need to occur . This analysis would also benefit from a validated measure at the town -level. Each 
of these steps would need time to vet data, create or develop a relationship of accessing the data, 
and time for analysis, resulting in increased cost to the Department.  
One serious  concern is the potential for cost shifts at the SAU level. Given SAU student 
characteristics and other labor market factors, any cost shifts or unintended consequences would 
be challenging to estimate for budgeting purposes and could have a significant impact o n SAU 
finances.  
The D epartment continues  to support the exploration of alternative metrics that seek to make the 
EPS funding formula more equitable.  The Department will be available to provide additional 
information  on LD 951 and respond to  any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
