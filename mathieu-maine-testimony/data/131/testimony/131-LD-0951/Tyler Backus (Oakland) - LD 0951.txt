Tyler Backus
Oakland
LD 951
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing: My name is Tyler Backus and I am a resident of Oakland, Maine. I write to 
you today in opposition of LD 951, An Act to Amend the State Education Funding 
Formula to Create Equity Between Municipalities by Adding Median Income to the 
Formula.
Instead of restating many of the same points, please refer to my testimony in 
opposition to LD 889 and support of LD 1160. 
Thank you for your time.
Tyler Backus
