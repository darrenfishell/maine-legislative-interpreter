LD 951
I am in support of LD 951 as this addresses a disparity in land value versus what the 
actual median incomes are for the local areas. Living in an area with high property 
values and low median household income has resulted in our district receiving very 
little funding - a total 11% of the 55% divided amongst 3 schools. I'm still horrified 
by that number.
