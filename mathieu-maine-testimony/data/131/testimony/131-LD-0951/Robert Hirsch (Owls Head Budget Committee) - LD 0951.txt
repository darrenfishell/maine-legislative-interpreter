Testimony of Dr. Robert Hirsch, Chair, Owls Head, Maine Budget Committee 
In favor of LD 951 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Honorable Members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee: 
My name is Dr. Robert Hirsch, Chair of the Owls Head Budget Committee. l 
appear to testify for LD 951 An Act to Amend the State Education Funding 
Formula to Create Equity Between Municipalities by Adding Median Income to 
the Formula 
Owls Head is one of 5 towns in RSU #13 including Rockland, Thomaston, 
South Thomaston, and Cushing. Over the last 4 years our school budget has 
increased annually at an average of 10.4%, considerably higher than inﬂation. 
This is 3.5 times the average increase in the other towns. Our per student cost 
is 29% higher than the average of the other towns. Of the five towns in RSU 
#13 only Owls Head receives no funding from the State of Maine to help with 
our soaring education costs. 
Of our residents 40% are 55 or older, with many on ﬁxed incomes. Sadly 11% 
of our seniors over 65 live in poverty. Owls Head is a coastal peninsula witha 
high percentage of properties being waterfront. Many of these are owned by 
elderly Mainers whose families have been there for generations. Unfortunately 
waterfront property dramatically skews the State’s funding formula. That 
formula also does not take income into account. Median income in Owls Head 
is about the same as for the State as a whole. .r 
For the ﬁrst time ever the Town of Owls Head voted against approving the 
RSU #13 budget last year. 
Owls Head residents, especially our older residents, are suffering greatly 
under the current State formula for allocating school support funds to towns. 
Unlike the other towns in RSU #13, Owls Head gets ZERO. The disparities 
among the five towns in RSU #13 are shocking. This is a serious injustice that 
needs to be addressed at the State level. Representative Geiger's LD 951 isa 
start to do that. 
l urge you to pass LD 951 and provide relief to those taxpayers who are 
struggling to pay their property taxes and for whom this is an inequity that 
needs to be addressed.
