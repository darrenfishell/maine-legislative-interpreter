TESTIMONY OF MATTHEW RUEL 
DIRECTOR, STATE BUREAU OF IDENTIFICATION 
 
In Opposition to LD 1731 
 
 
Members of the Committee: 
 
My name is Matthew Ruel, and I am the Director of the State Bureau of 
Identification within the Department of Public Safety.  I provide this testimony on behalf 
of the Administration in opposition to LD 1731 An Act Regarding Confidentiality of 
Juvenile History Record Information. 
 
SBI serves as the repository of all criminal history information in the state, and 
currently provides criminal history for law enforcement and public purposes. We are 
responsible for providing this information to law enforcement across the country, from the 
officer roadside all the way through the criminal justice processes up to judges making 
sentencing decisions.  This information is also used as part of hiring, certification, and 
licensing requirements on a state and national level.  Many organizations rely on this 
information to vet potential employees or volunteers that have direct contact with 
vulnerable populations.  SBI completes more than 500,000 public searches annually.  
Having an accurate, complete, timely criminal history is our mission and a key component 
in public safety.   
 
 This bill repeals the provision of law that allows to be disclosed publicly an 
adjudication and resulting disposition of a juvenile who has been adjudicated to have 
committed a juvenile crime that would constitute murder or a Class A, B or C crime if the 
juvenile were an adult.

This public policy decision impacts a small number of individuals when looking at 
the combined criminal history records maintained at SBI.  When considering this cohort 
remember that we already have a process in place where the courts can seal the record and 
prevent public dissemination.   In fact, is seems that over the last half dozen years we have 
received more of these sealing orders when we receive the conviction information from the 
court.   These convictions are the most serious offenses we recognize and potentially a 
person may only be a few years removed from the criminal conduct when applying for a 
job or joining the military and if this LD is supported criminal history information would 
not be shared outside of law enforcement purposes.   
 
For these reasons the Administration is in opposition to LD 1731.    I will try to 
attend work sessions and work with the committee as needed to answer any further 
questions.    
 
Thank you, 
 
Matthew Ruel 
Director State Bureau of Identification
