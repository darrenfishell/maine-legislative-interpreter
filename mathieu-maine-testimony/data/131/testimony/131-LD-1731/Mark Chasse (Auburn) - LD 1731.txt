LD 1731 Ought-NOT-to pass as it represents an opportunity for non transparency in 
government involvement in citizens especially the care of children. It opens the door 
for hiding misapplication of government rules and laws as it relates to children. There 
is a history of children being mistreated by public systems from care givers to family 
courts. Cases have been well documented across the country. That's why there is a 
need to keep processes transparent while still protecting individual identities.
Thank you.
