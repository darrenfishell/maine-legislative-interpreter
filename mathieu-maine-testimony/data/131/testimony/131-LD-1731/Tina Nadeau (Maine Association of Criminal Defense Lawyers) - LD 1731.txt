Thank you, Speaker Talbot Ross, for your continued advocacy in this important arena and on behalf of Maine’s youth.  This is the fix we have needed in the Juvenile Code for decades. The 2021 amendments to the current Juvenile Code are both labyrinth and ineffective and do not adequately credit the malleability of youth. We need to protect juvenile records confidentiality across the board. Children are children, no matter what they are accused of or adjudicated of doing.   How do our histories, our pasts, impact our futures? Can we ever truly move on to a second act? Are our futures predetermined by what has happened before? Don’t our children, of all people, deserve a second act in their lives, an act that is unencumbered by the mistakes of their youth? This bill would help clear the path towards more productive, involved, hopeful futures for Maine’s children and young people. Protection of the confidentiality of juvenile records is absolutely essential to the juvenile justice system’s central tenet of rehabilitation. We are all so much more than the worst thing we have ever done. This is especially true of children.  Both the U.S. Supreme Court and our own Law Court have recognized that children are different and we have the juvenile system to protect kids, not punish them:  “The juvenile court planners envisaged a system that would practically immunize juveniles from ‘punishment’ for ‘crimes’ in an effort to save them from youthful indiscretions and stigmas due to criminal charges or convictions.” In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 60 (1967) (J. Black, concurring).  “The purpose of juvenile courts . . . is to carry out a modern method of dealing with youthful offenders, so that there may be no criminal record against immature youth to cause detrimental local gossip and future handicaps because of childhood errors and indiscretions, and also that the child who is not inclined to follow legal or moral patterns, may be guided or reformed to become, in his mature years, a useful citizen.” Wade v. Warden of State Prison, 73 A.2d 128 (Me. 1950)  I stand before you today as a criminal defense attorney: though I represent juveniles in appeals and in post-conviction reviews and in other, non-trial matters, in the trial courts, I only represent adults charged with crimes. The proposal before you is, in 
part, intended to keep fewer young people out of the adult system. Juvenile records’ public availability dramatically increases the rates of recidivism for young people. They remain trapped in the system. As much as I love young people, I don’t want them to be my clients. Too many of my clients have been juvenile system-involved. This bill would help prevent that from happening over and over and over again.  Nine states completely prohibit all public access to juvenile records at any time, regardless of the seriousness of the offense, the number of offenses, or the age of the juvenile—California, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Caroline, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Vermont. These states fully protect juvenile record information from public accessibility. Maine can and should join their ranks. Twenty-four states, including Maine, require youth to initiate the process for sealing or expungement of their records, placing the burden on the youth to obtain information about his eligibility and the process for obtaining sealing or expungement. Young people typically require the assistance of counsel to navigate the system. The processes in these states are not effective.  When juveniles have completed their dispositions, they have served their prison time, paid their fines or restitution, completed their community service, undergone substance abuse or mental health treatment, participated in restorative justice programming: they have done what has been asked of them in the name of rehabilitation and growth. The continued stain of their juvenile records is punishment beyond the crime.   The most common rationale for continuing to allow public access to juvenile records, and I am sure you will hear from at least one prosecutor today who will tell you this, is the protection of “public safety.” This is not persuasive in the face of the evidence nor in the face of the purposes of the Juvenile Code. The general view is that youth who break the law will commit other crimes in the future, even if they have no history of reoffending. Research, however, has shown that making juvenile records available to the public does not make communities safer; in fact, it makes our communities less safe.   Public juvenile records have a greater likelihood of decreasing public safety when they incorrectly or unnecessarily disqualify individuals from employment. Research has revealed a strong and consistent negative effect of incarceration on the employment probabilities and income of individuals with criminal records. Among adult offenders, a lack of employment is the single greatest predictor of recidivism. Open juvenile records create unemployment, they result in recidivism.  According to the National Employment Law Project, “The irony is that employers’ attempts to safeguard the workplace are not only barring many people who pose little to no risk, but they also are compromising public safety. As studies have shown, providing individuals the opportunity for stable employment actually lowers crime recidivism rates and thus increases public safety.”  A recent report on the cost of youth incarceration estimated that the range of lost earnings for incarcerated youth is between $4 and $7.6 billion. Even after incarceration and when youth are somehow able to overcome initial barriers to obtaining employment, they are more likely to have spotty, low-paying employment. This is waste of human potential, to say the least.  One legal scholar has noted that criminal history records act as “brands of inferiority,” barring people from public and private housing, education opportunities, professional licensures, military service, and social welfare, which, in turn, can lock them out of mainstream society and into a life of recidivism—adult crime. Anything we can do to prevent such devastating effects we should and must do. Period.  I believe in kids. I believe in their capacity for growth and change. I believe that when we support kids, when we give them opportunities to use their energy and 
creativity and resilience and strength, every single one of us benefits. Juvenile records are holding our young people back; their pasts are dictating their futures. Let us preserve the confidentiality of these records, for once and for all, and give kids the bright futures they deserve.  Thank you for your consideration, for your attention to this matter, and for allowing me to share this testimony with you all today.                     Sincerely,                                                                        Tina Heather Nadeau, Esq.                              MACDL Executive Director
