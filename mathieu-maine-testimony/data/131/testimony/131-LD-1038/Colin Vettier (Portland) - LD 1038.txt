My name is Colin Vettier, I live in Portland Maine, and I would like to share my opposition for both: 
o LD 1038 — Repealing Ranked Choice Voting 
and 
- LD 1055 — Bans Ballot Drop boxes 
I have witnessed repeated attacks against democracy, trying to keep portions of the population from havinga 
voice, sometimes even from accessing the constitutional right that is voting. 
We need more democracy, more voters to access the ballot. 
What we don't need are more attempts at stealing the power from the People. 
Kindly, 
Colin VETTIER
