RE:  LD 1038 - An Act to Reinstate Plurality Voting by Repealing the 
Ranked-Choice Voting Laws
My name is Pamela Vose.   I live in Union and I have voted in almost every election 
since I was eligible to vote back in the early seventies.  
I am testifying against LD 1038.
Ranked Choice Voting has had a positive effect on the tone of campaigns here in 
Maine allowing voters to get a clear idea of the positions of the candidates instead of 
encouraging negative mudslinging at opponents.  The end result is a winner with 
support of the majority of voters and elected representatives who are more likely to 
work with others and seek compromise when necessary for the benefit of all Mainers. 
Remember, Maine, like the US population in general is made up of voters who 
consider themselves to be independent as well as those enrolled in the two major 
parties.    This also eliminates the expense of costly run-off elections which some 
other states use to achieve a similar result.
I was present at my local polling place collecting signatures from voters on a separate 
matter during the initial use of RCV and stationed close to where voters submitted 
their ballots after voting.  I was not at all surprised to observe that the vast majority of
voters had no problem understanding and using the RCV ballot and the rare instance 
of confusion was easily and quickly resolved by the election clerks.  
I am a firm believer that RCV is working well here in Maine and I am adamantly 
against going back to plurality voting and the negativity and extreme polarization and 
partisanship that it encourages.   
Thank you for this opportunity to share my opinion and observations on this 
important issue.
