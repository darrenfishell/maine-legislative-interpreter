Dear Members of the Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs,
I am writing to provide my testimony against LD 1038, which aims to repeal ranked choice voting in Maine. 
Ranked choice voting has been gaining popularity across the United States to ensure that voters have a more 
meaningful say in the election process. With ranked choice voting, voters can rank candidates in order of 
preference, rather than just selecting one candidate. This process helps to ensure that the winning candidate 
has broad support among the electorate.
There are many benefits to ranked choice voting, including:
More accurate representation of voter preferences: With ranked choice voting, voters can express their 
preferences more accurately, rather than being limited to choosing just one candidate. This helps to ensure 
that the winning candidate has broad support among the electorate.
Encourages positive campaigning: Ranked choice voting encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of 
voters, rather than just their base. This can lead to more civil and issue-focused campaigns.
Reduces the likelihood of vote splitting: In a traditional election with multiple candidates, there is a risk that 
similar candidates will split the vote, leading to a winner who does not have broad support. Ranked choice 
voting reduces this risk, as voters can express their preferences for multiple candidates.
Saves money: By eliminating the need for costly runoff elections, ranked choice voting can save taxpayers 
money.
Maine has already implemented ranked choice voting for its federal elections, and the results have been 
positive. In the 2018 midterm elections, Maine's 2nd Congressional District used ranked choice voting, and the 
winning candidate was able to win with a majority of the votes, despite there being multiple candidates in the 
race.
Repealing ranked choice voting in Maine would be a step backwards for democracy and would limit the ability 
of voters to express their preferences in a meaningful way. It would also undermine the progress that has 
already been made in improving the electoral process in Maine.
Overall, I believe that LD 1038 is a misguided attempt to repeal an important electoral reform that has been 
shown to increase voter participation, encourage positive campaigning, and provide more accurate 
representation of voter preferences. I urge you to reject this bill and to continue to support ranked choice 
voting in Maine.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Donald Herbert
