LD 1038
I would like to express my support as a citizen of the State of Maine for LD 1038 - An Act to 
Reinstate Plurality Voting by Repealing the Ranked-choice Voting Laws.
I believe that with the current party affiliations in the state the law clearly favors Democrat and
Liberal leaning candidates.  An example of this would be the 2018 2nd. Congressional District
election when the Republican candidate (Paloquin) lead after the first round of voting, but lost 
to the Democratic Candidate in subsequent voting when the third candidate's votes went to 
Golden.  The third party candidate was clearly liberal.  In a race that was  going to be very 
close, ranked choice clearly favored the Democrat, as the third party candidate and her 
supporters were more closely aligned with the Democratic candidate.  In essence, it was two 
against one.  This significantly weakens the opposition party and could send us slipping 
toward one party rule.
