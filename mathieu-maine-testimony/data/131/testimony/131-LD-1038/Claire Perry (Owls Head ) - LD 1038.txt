Dear Committee Members: 
Upon listening to the hearing of this bill yesterday via Zoom, I was more than a little 
disgusted at the person whose testimony implied that Maine's senior citizens are not 
able to understand ranked choice voting and are confused !  How insulting. I and all 
of my many senior friends have heartily welcomed this much needed change for the 
good. When there are more than two candidates from which to choose, this makes 
perfect sense to obtain a majority vote; which is by far the most fair.
