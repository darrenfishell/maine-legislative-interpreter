RE: LD 2 038 - An Act to Reinstate Plurality Voting by Repealing the Ranked -choice Voting Laws  
___________________________________________________________________________  
 
My name is Micha el Shunney  and I am a resident of Rockland . Iâ€™m writing  today, as a  longtime  
citizen of Maine , to oppose LD 1038 . 
We, the citizens of Maine, not only went far out of our way in frigid winter to sign petitions, all 
over the state, to have a citizens initiative on the ballot in the next election cycle, but th at ballot 
measure passed convincingly  at the pol ls. The citizens of Maine have spoken and the tiny 
minority of the sponsor of this bill and those within the legislature  that want to restrict 
democracy, should n ot use their power to overturn the will of the people.  
Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) has been us ed successfully in Maine  to ensure that our elected 
officials actually represent a majority of the people. RCV has also  allowed  more civility in 
election ca mpaigns and helped reduce the destructive divisiveness  of the strictly 2 candidate 
election ballot slate s. 
RCV in Maine has also become a positive model for other states that see the enormous benefits 
of the instant run -off system, saving money  and reducing the inconvenience to voters of 
multiple elections.  
I stand with the majority of Maine voters to oppose LD 1038 . 
Sincerely,   Michael Shunney, Rockland
