I support ranked choice voting. I think that more people will be moved to vote, if 
ranked choice voting is in place. I feel that, having ranked choice in place, candidates 
will be freer to speak to issues that are important to them, and will be less likely to 
denounce their opponents. Instead of negatively fighting an opponent, they will fight 
to properly communicate their opinions to voters. I think that an election with lest 
vitriol will attract more voters to participate.
