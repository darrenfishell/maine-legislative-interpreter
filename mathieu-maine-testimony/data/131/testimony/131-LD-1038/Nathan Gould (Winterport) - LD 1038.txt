Testimony in Support of LD 1038
An Act to Reinstate Plurality Voting by Repealing the Ranked-choice Voting Laws 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs:
My name is Nathan Gould, and I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1038, “An Act 
to Reinstate Plurality Voting by Repealing the Ranked-choice Voting Laws.”
To use a more casual vernacular, I believe that when the People of Maine were presented with 
ranked-choice voting, we were sold a bill of goods. Ranked-choice voting has caused confusion in the 
voting boot, consternation at the outcome of elections, and a lack of confidence in the whole process.
It need not be a complicated thing, this system of democracy that undergirds our State and 
Republic: one ballot, one vote. This is easy to understand for all voters. This is, in fact, fair. We look at 
third-party candidates as “spoilers,” but I would draw attention to European elections with half a 
dozen parties represented, if not more. True, their system has differences, yet they still evidence that 
three or even four candidates in our elections isn’t nearly as “bad” as it could be—if one considers 
wider participation in politics a bad thing. I question the virtue of just two parties.
Distinguished members of the Committee, I say the ranked-choice voting experiment has run 
its course and has been found wanting. I say it is time to restore plurality voting, that tried and true 
method for determining who is chosen for office. Let the electorate make their one choice with clarity 
and confidence.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass, and I thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
