Re: Testimony against LD1038, An Act to Reinstate Plurality Voting By Repealing the 
Ranked-Choice Voting Laws
I live in Limington and I have been a voter in Maine for over 40 years.
With ranked-choice voting, I like that if my first choice is eliminated then my vote for that 
candidate will go to my second choice. 
The same happens for other voters' eliminated first choices.  
This way, the eventual winner will still be the person who has the most votes.....maybe not 
first-choice votes, but accumulated votes. 
Therefore the chosen candidate is more fairly and broadly elected by more voters.
To me, this is a true win-win.
Mainers voted for ranked choice voting in 2016.  It is a voting system that is going 
well in our state. 
Please vote "ought not to pass" for LD1038.
Thank you.
Mary Laughlin
