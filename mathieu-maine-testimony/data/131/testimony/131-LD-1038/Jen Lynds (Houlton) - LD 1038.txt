LD 1038
Dear Committee Members,
It is difficult to understand the submission of yet another reductive bill on ranked choice 
voting. It illustrates a failure to listen to voters, who consistently have supported this measure.
It also has been upheld in court.  I am testifying in opposition to this bill, LD 1038.
In terms of ensuring fair and equitable representation in our democracy, repealing ranked 
choice voting would be a step backwards. It has been demonstrated that ranked choice voting
increases voter participation, promotes majority winners, and encourages candidates to 
appeal to a broader range of voters, rather than just their base.
By eradicating ranked choice voting, we would revert to a system in which candidates can win with a 
small share of the vote, resulting in a lack of representation for most voters. It would also discourage 
candidates from running outside the two major parties, thereby limiting voter choice and stifling the 
possibility of novel perspectives and ideas.
Additionally, ranked choice voting has been effective in fostering civil and positive campaigns,
as candidates are incentivized to appeal to a broader range of voters, rather than just their 
base. Its repeal would result in the return of negative, divisive campaigns that are not in the 
best interests of the electorate.
In terms of ensuring a fair and representative electoral process, eliminating ranked choice 
voting would be a step backwards; it would only serve to limit voter choice and discourage 
participation.
Thanks, Jen Lynds
