LD 1038  An Act to Reinstate Plurality Voting by Repealing the Ranked-choice Voting Laws
Testimony:  OUGHT NOT TO PASS
I strongly oppose this legislation.  The League of Women Voters of Maine, after extensive study, 
supported Instant Run Off/Rank Choice Voting legislation in 2011.  This year, the success of Rank 
Choice Voting in states like Alaska and Nevada, has motivated 14 more state legislatures to introduce 
similar legislation.
No evidence is presented that Maine elections in 2018, 2020 or 2022 were compromised by Rank Choice 
Voting.  In fact, Maine voters had a range of choices for candidates in primary and general elections, 
encouraging voters across the political spectrum to get more involved in our elections.  
Other benefits to Rank Choice Voting include:
Candidates who focus on issues and detailed platform positions that distinguish them from their 
opponents, motivate more interest among voters.
Candidates who appeal to a wide range of voters are more successful raising campaign funds.
Candidates who generate positive and respectful advertising campaigns generate support from 
voters across all constituencies. 
For these reasons and more, I urge the committee to report this bill as OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
