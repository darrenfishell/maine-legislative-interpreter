LD 1038
Dear Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs and Chair Mr. Hickman,
I urge you to support LD 1038 - An Act to Reinstate Plurality Voting by Repealing 
the Ranked-choice Voting Laws. I ran for the House seat this past election and one of 
the complaints I heard most frequently was regarding rank choice voting. In fact, it 
was the number two reason voters in my district gave to me when asked why they 
were not voting.... "Too confusing", "Corrupt", "my voice doesn't count," "I don't 
know how to vote with that system,"  etc.  Not one person who I spoke with 
throughout my campaign thought Rank Choice was a good system.
The people of Maine were duped into thinking Rank Choice would make elections 
more fair. Nothing is further than the truth. We have a system no one understands, 
few trust, and worse it doesn't make elections more fair or more secure. 
Please support LD 1038.
Thank you,
