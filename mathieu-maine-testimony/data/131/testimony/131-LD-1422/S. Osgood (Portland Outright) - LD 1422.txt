April 14, 2023
Dear Senator Pierce, Rep. Gere, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on the Housing: 
My name is Osgood, I use they/them pronouns, and I am the Executive Director of 
Portland Outright, which has been representing and advocating for Maine’s LGBTQ+ 
youth since 1988. I am testifying today on behalf of Portland Outright and Equality 
Maine in support of LD 1422: An Act to End Homelessness and Assist Students Who 
Are Homeless by Establishing a Housing Voucher Program and Providing Site-based 
Housing Services.
At both organizations, our mission is an urgent response to the dire conditions in 
Maine and the United States for people of color and gender non-conforming queer 
people, who face discriminatory violence and persecution at disproportionate rates 
and are also systematically denied access to adequate housing and healthcare. 
LGBTQ+ young people continue to make up 40% of the homeless youth population, 
despite making up less than 10% of the US youth population generally. This bill 
would improve conditions for LGBTQ+ young people navigating homelessness due 
to their life circumstances, including lack of family support and economic insecurity. 
Housing justice is inextricable from LGBTQ+ equity and we are proud to support this
bill.
Those of us in LGBTQ+ spaces know first hand that access to safe, secure housing is 
a lifeline for people of all ages, particularly for young people. The research also 
shows that LGBTQ+ youth who have at least one supportive, accepting adult are 40%
less likely to report a suicide attempt in the past year. Stable housing is vital to 
maintaining participation in educational spaces and relationships with the supportive 
adults in those spaces, such as teachers, school counselors, and coaches. This voucher 
program has additional benefits for our youth and communities, as lack of safe 
housing and access to services directly causes the stress, unsafe conditions, and 
impossible choices that lead to poor mental and physical health outcomes, as well as 
interactions with the juvenile justice system.  Put simply, the streets and shelters are 
not places to grow up.
Here in Portland and across the state, we are in a housing crisis. A lack of affordable 
housing and the economic hardships many Maine families endured during the 
COVID-19 pandemic means more young people are trying to stay in school while 
worrying about where they will sleep at night. These vouchers would be a lifesaving 
intervention for students navigating unstable housing. 
We urge you to pass LD1422 and to communicate to our state’s young people that 
their communities and their state care about them. During this pivotal developmental 
time in those young people’s lives, we hope to count you as one of the supportive 
adults on their team.
Sincerely,
S. Osgood
