Rachelle Bristol  – Executive Director , Maine Education Association  
Before the Housi ng Committee  
April  14, 2023  
 
Senator Pierce , Representative Gere  and esteemed members of the Housing Committee,  
 
My name is Rachelle Bristol  (she/her), and I am proud to serve as the Executive Director for the Maine 
Education Association (MEA) . The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, including 
teachers and other professionals in nearly every public school in the state and faculty and other 
professional staff in the University of Maine and Community College Systems.  
 
I offer te stimony in support of LD 1422 , An Act to End Homelessness and Assist Students Who Are 
Homeless by Establishing a Housing Voucher Program and Providing Site -Based Housing Services.  
 
It is not news that for children to learn that they need to have  their basic needs met  – food, shelter, 
safety, etc . There are too many children in Maine that do not have those basic needs met  and struggle 
daily . We must do more to provide as much stability as we can as a society to the most vulnerable 
among us  – our c hildren .  
 
Housing insecurity is particularly troubling given the fear that these students must feel when they do not 
know where they will sleep that night or if they will even be with their parents. Seventeen percent of the 
more than 2,000 homeless youth in Maine are not in the physical control of their parents according to the 
National Center for Homeless Education , and a ccording to the Maine Department of Education, Maine 
registered 2,186 homeless students in 2023, up from 1,457 in 2022 and 1,355 in 2021.  
 
This is a trend we do not want to continue.  
 
LD 1422 would provide a starting place to address this growing problem in our society and state. 
Providing vouchers and dedicated sites to provide housing for homeless students  would be a step in the 
right direction.  It is not the entire remedy,  but an importa nt move towards a more global solution .  
 
Thank you.
