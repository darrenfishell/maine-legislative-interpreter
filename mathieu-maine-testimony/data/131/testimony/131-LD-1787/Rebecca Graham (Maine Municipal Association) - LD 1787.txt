 
Testimony of The Maine Municipal Association 
Neither For Nor Against 
LD 1787 - Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to Convene a 
Stakeholder Group Tasked with a Comprehensive Overhaul and Modernization of the State Subdivision 
Statutes 
May 9, 2023 
Sen. Pierce, Rep. Gere, and distinguished members of the Housing Committee, my name is 
Rebecca Graham and I am submitting testimony in neither for nor against LD 1787, Resolve, Directing 
the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to Convene a Stakeholder Group Tasked with 
a Comprehensive Overhaul and Modernization of the State Subdivision Statutes, on behalf of Maine 
Municipal Association which represents the interests of municipal government before the state and 
federal government. The positions of the Association are formed at the direction of our 70-member 
Legislative Policy Committee, (LPC) who are elected by the selectboards and council of the 
municipalities in each of the 35 Senate districts in Maine. As a result, the positions represent a wide view 
of communities with varying resources, rural and urban, and those with ample local resources as well as 
those with none.  
Municipal officials appreciate that this proposed stakeholder group includes municipal 
representation from elected officials and planners. Additionally, representation should also be considered 
from Code Enforcement Officers who stand at the nexus of state law, road standards and neighborhood 
issues.  
While officials are not clear what problems the group should review and address, they appreciate 
a seat at the table as all the duties to review, enforce, and accept fall onto local government. To that end, 
officials are neither for nor against LD 1787, and thank the sponsor for including their government 
partners.
