Republican Cory R
LD 1428
Good morning, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is Cory Reynolds  and
I come before you today to support LD 1428, An Act to Ensure Treatment for 
MaineCare Recipients with Serious Mental Illness by Prohibiting the Requirements 
for Prior Authorization and Step Therapy for Medications.
getting the right medication for someone that is struggling with mental health 
illnesses is highly important. 
I know people who struggle with mental health. I believe our state needs to help 
people with mental health. Right now if you need to do a med change you have to get 
admitted to the hospital and be there for a week or longer, that is really crazy that you 
have to be away from your loved ones. why canâ€™t the doctor do something and change
the meds? please i ask you to vote ought to pass on LD: 1428. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
