In Opposition to  
LD 1268, An Act to Provide for a Local Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Exemption for Qualifying 
Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Medical Services Person   
 
May 11, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in opposition to LD 1268 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest.   
While municipal officials appreciate that the authority provided in LD 1268 is voluntary, 
municipal officials oppose the bill.  Local leaders b elieve the inequities created in the proposed 
approach outweigh the benefits. Specifically, by tying the value of the benefit to the amount of 
excise taxes paid, rather than on a set dollar amount, the program will provide greater benefits to 
volunteers wi th new vehicles, than that provided to the owners of older vehicles. Furthermore, 
local leaders fear that once the door is open, the Legislature will be pressured to extend the 
benefit to other volunteers, thereby placing additional burdens on local legisl ative bodies to 
further erode this revenue source.   
Thank you for your time and consideration.
