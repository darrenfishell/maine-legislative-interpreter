7 TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ. 
Ought Not to Pass - LD 1509 . 
An Act to Amend Certain Provisions of Maine's Drug Laws 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY' 
April 1s, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety, greetings. My name is Michael 
Kebede, and I am-the Policy Counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine,a 
statewide organization committed to advancing and preserving civil rights and civil liberties 
guaranteed byf the Maine and U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our members, Weurgei you to 
reject this bill. 
Last session, the Legislature made extraordinary progress in giving words their plain and 
ordinary meanings. ‘ Before the enactment of last session’s LD I675, the Maine Criminal Code 
gave the word “Trafﬁck” a defnition that bears no resemblance to how that word is used by 
ordinary people. Before last year, possessing 2 grams of heroin meant that you were guilty of 
trafﬁcking heroin. This law made it easy for prosecutors to win trafﬁcking convictions — even if 
they did not prove that any trafficking actually took place. The enactment of LD 1675 ensured 
that the word “Trafﬁck” in the Maine Criminal Code means: . 
A. To make, create, or manufacture; 
B. To grow or cultivate, except for marijuana; 
C. To sell, barter, trade, exchange or otherwise furnish for consideration; or 
D. To possess With the intent to do any act mentioned in paragraph C. 
This makes sense — this is closer to how an ordinary person would deﬁne words, although most 
people would consider trafﬁcking far more than what is currently in statute. The same goes for 
the word “fumish.” Before last session’s LD 1675, Maine law gave that word an absurd 
'

deﬁnition: in certain circumstances, to “furnish” and to merely possess were synonyms. If 
enacted, the bill before you would reverse Maine’s progress. It would, once again, ensure that the 
words in our statute books bear no resemblance to the words in our communities. Trafficking and 
furnishing would once again be synonymous with possession in Chapter 45 of the Maine 
Criminal Code. 
This would amount to a shortcut for the government in taking away people’s liberties. It 
would unfairly weight criminal cases in favor of the government and violate basic tenets of due 
process of law. These due process violations are not merely academic. They have created real 
harm in our state. While the total drug arrests in our state rose only slightly between 2008 and 
2018, Class A drug arrests rose by 157 percent and Class B drug arrests rose by 13 percent 
during that time? Drug arrests of women increased 25 percent between 2008 and 2018, with 
Class A drug arrests more than tripling during that time.3 Of the new admissions to Maine’s 
women’s prison in 2020, 58 percent were for drug crimesf‘ The racial disparities are stark: Black 
people make up about 1.6 percent of Maine’s population, but are 21 percent of the Class A drug 
arrests and l5 percent of the Class B drug arrests.5 The shortcuts given to the government have 
not kept our community members safer: deaths from drug overdoses are higher than they have 
ever been, killing 2 people a day. Fentanyl laces an increasing amount of street dnigs, notjust 
opioids, so that many people who buy drugs are carrying around mixtures that contain fentanyl 
without even realizing it. And, because many people who have serious substance use disorder 
use signiﬁcantly more than 2 grams of drugs in a day, this means that an increasing number of 
people are subject to our drug trafficking laws simply for having in their possession drugs to try 
to keep sickness at bay. 
We urge you to vote ought not to pass.
