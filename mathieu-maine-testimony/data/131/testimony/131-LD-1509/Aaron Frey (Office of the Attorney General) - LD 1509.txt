Testimony in Opposition to LD 1 5 09, An Act to Amend Certain Provisions of 
Maine's Drug Laws 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee. My name is Aaron Frey, and I have the honor of serving as 
Maine’s Attorney General. I come before you today to express my opposition to LD I 509, An Act 
to Amend Certain Provisions of Maine ’s Drug Laws. 
, LD 1509 attempts to repeal P.L. 2021 Ch. 396. This law resulted from the passage of LD 
1675 in the 130“ Legislature, which represented meaningful work to make the following reforms 
to Maine’s criminal drug laws: 
l. Removed an unj ustiﬁable disparate treatment between cocaine and cocaine in the form 
of cocaine base, commonly known as “crack;” 
2. Removed small amounts of heroin and fentanyl from the deﬁnition of “traffick ” and 
“ftu'nish; ” and 
3. Provided a permissible inference that possession of certain threshold amounts of heroin 
and fentanyl constituted trafficking or furnishing, which fmally treated these two drugs like all 
other drugs. 
These reforms by the 130*“ Legislature made the state’s criminal drugs laws more in line 
with the realities of possessing drugs versus trafficking or furnishing drugs‘ . The amendments last 
session did not interfere with a prosecutor ’s ability to charge either trafficking or furnishing of 
heroin or fentanyl when those charges are supported by sufficient evidence. Furthermore, these 
amendments recognized that possession of certain quantities of speciﬁc drugs do not necessarily 
equate to trafﬁcking or furnishing, and defendants are now permitted the opportunity to present a 
defense of personal use even Where sufficient quantities of heroin or fentanyl are involved. 
I appreciated the opportunity to work with both the sponsor of LD 1675 and the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee to legislate these modest reforms. I continue to believe these 
refonns were fair, and my ofﬁce continues to be able to hold those who trafﬁck or furnish heroin 
and fentanyl accountable. Finally, I am unaware of any reason why these reforms should be 
abandoned. 
For these reasons, I oppose LD 1509 and urge this Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass. 
Thank you, andI am happy to answer any questions.
