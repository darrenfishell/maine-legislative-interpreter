L.D. 1509, “An Act to Amend Certain Provisions of Maine's Drug 
Laws?’ 
Presented by 
Representative Richard H. Campbell 
District 19 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee 
Tuesday, April 18, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety: 
l am State Representative Dick Campbell, and l proudly represent District 19, 
Eddington, Holden, and Orrington. It is an honor to appear before you today for the 
purpose of introducing L.D. 1509, “An Act to Amend Certain Provisions of Maine's 
Drug Laws." 
The intent of this proposed legislation is to reverse changes made by the passage of 
PL 2021, Chap. 396 (L.D. 1675), “An Act To Amend Certain Provisions of Maine's 
Drug Laws.” The chaptered law changed presumptive amounts of scheduled drugs for 
trafficking and furnishing. The presumptive amount for the trafficking of fentanyllheroin 
was raised from two grams to four grams, while the presumptive amount for the 
furnishing of fentanyl/heroin was raised from 201 mg to two grams. 
increasing presumptive amounts of dangerous drugs, such as fentanyl, removes 
accountability for those who provide" drugs to others at the street level. it creates 
opportunity for traffickers to carry hundreds of dollars worth of drugs with very limited 
risk of accountability. Permissiveness on the possession of dangerous drugs will not 
reduce demand. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
