LD 618
I write today in opposition to LD 618. The sponsor of this bill has tried to create 
policy that they have no experience, knowledge, or understanding of. The legislation 
written was only done because in some parts of the country people who don't 
understand the value of Critical Race Theory are being vocal. I would ask the sponsor
to ask themselves do I truly understand how important the teaching of racial history, 
structures, difference that effect swaths of American citizens is to our children? In 
Maine, one of the least racially diverse states in the country. To try to create policy 
that does not help teach children about America’s long dark history and how our 
country has systems built around racial inequity is robbing them of a deeper 
understanding in relation to their peers. CRT is not designed to shame children or 
make them feel guilty, but to increase their perspective. Any good teacher who is 
trained around CRT will teach the children with sympathy, complexity and 
nourishment. 
I ask those who are considering the acceptance of LD 618 to reflect on what you are 
missing in your understanding or experience with race? What makes you dislike 
teaching our children about racial history in America? Have I ever known anyone 
who has dealt with racial aggressions, inequality. Better yet someone’s who’s family 
legacy was eradicated, only because of the color of their skin. If you cannot answer 
these questions, then you should not be creating policy robbing future generations of a
truly better understanding of the history and differences that their friends and families 
live with. 
It is for these reasons I have shared (among many others) that I ask the Education 
Committee to vote Ought not to pass on LD 618. 
Thank you for reading.
