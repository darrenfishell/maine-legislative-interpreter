LD 618
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Paul Seidman. I am writing to state that I am against LD 618 and very 
briefly identify why.
Of the three bills being considered on May 4, 2023, I believe LD 618 is the most 
obviously political and reactionary. It is worded to remove existing law and reverse 
explicitly expressed educational values. On Dec. 11, 2020, the Maine Dept. of 
Education released a statement that includes the following: "We proudly and 
steadfastly support the educators and districts in Maine who are taking on the work of 
understanding and dismantling racism and inequity in our schools and communities. 
We urge all Maine schools and educators to accept their role and responsibilities in 
examining and addressing the inequities that have long existed in our society and 
institutions."
Among other important objectives, CRT and DEI education exists to teach about race 
as such, including its function before and after the creation of the United States. This 
bill endeavors to re-silence the American voices of all races who have so richly and 
factually expanded our knowledge of history, society, and literature. Its passage 
would effectively tear up the statement made by the Department of Education in 
2020. Its value is for ignorance and silence. For reference, I include this link:

I strongly urge you to oppose LD 618.
With thanks for your time and consideration.
