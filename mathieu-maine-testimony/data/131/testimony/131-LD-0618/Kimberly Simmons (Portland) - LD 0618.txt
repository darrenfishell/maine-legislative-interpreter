Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs
Committee,
My
name
is
Kimberly
Simmons,
from
Portland
Maine.
I
hold
a
doctorate
in
sociology
and
have
taught
college
courses
related
to
social
justice
for
more
than
2
decades.
I
am
testifying
today
in
opposition
to
LD
618.
Below
I
will
address
many
of
the
substantive
concerns
I
have
about
this
bill.
In
summary
though,
I
ask
you
to
vote
against
this
bill
as
it
misinterprets
and
misconstrues
Critical
Race
Theory
and
Social
and
Emotional
Learning.
The
concerns
listed
as
prohibitions
of
instruction
gravely
mischaracterize
these
fields.
The
concerns
are
also
contradictory ,
and
the
overall
stated
intent
-
to
reduce
prejudice
and
discrimination
in
Maine’ s
classrooms
-
undermined
by
the
specific
(and
confusing)
prohibitions.
If
you
agree
with
the
worry
that
prejudices
or
discriminatory
behaviors
are
practiced
in
schools,
and
do
not
believe
the
Maine
Human
Rights
Act
goes
far
enough
in
protecting
students
from
discrimination
based
on
race
or
sex,
I
encourage
you
to
support
LD
1610
which
would
enshrine
equal
protection
into
Maine’ s
Constitution.
I
do
believe
that
raciam
and
sexism
interfere
with
students'
academic
success.
The
results
of
the
Maine
Y outh
Integrative
Health
Study
are
extremely
concerning
and
highlight
the
disproportionate
experiences
of
violence
for
girls,
LGBTQ
and
students
of
color
in
Maine.
W e
need
more
tools
to
address
these
ongoing
problems,
including
more
robust
investments
in
social
and
emotional
learning
for
prevention
and
intervention.
Prevention
work
is
in
fact
required
by
Federal
T itle
IX
rules
and
a
State
law
that
contradicts
T itle
IX
is
extremely
problematic.
Similarly ,
Maine
law
requires
teaching
about
W abanaki
Studies
and
Genocide.
These
teachings
necessarily
include
a
component
of
CR T
in
its
broadest
definition.
LD
618
will
not
help
us
make
our
schools
more
equal.
It
could,
however ,
encourage
harassment
of
teachers
at
a
time
when
we
need
to
retain,
support
and
recruit
educators
in
Maine.
What
Is
Critical
Race
Theory?
LD
618,
An
Act
to
Eliminate
Critical
Race
Theory ,
Social
and
Emotional
Learning
and
Diversity ,
Equity
and
Inclusion
from
School
Curricula
misuses
the
term
Critical
Race
Theory .
The
definitions
provided
below
suggest
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
body
of
work
that
has
been
developed
since
Kimberlé
Crenshaw
coined
the
conceptual
phrase
in
the
1970s.
Scholars
such
as
john
powell,
Patricia
Williams,
Patricia
Hill
Collins
and
Derrek
Bell
were
challenged
to
consider
how
we
might
address
ongoing
patterns
of
discrimination
and
inequality
that
persisted
after
the
landmark
1964
Act
was
enacted.
Civil
Rights
laws
are
vital
tools
for
preventing
some
forms
of
racial
discrimination
but
are
not
panaceas
for
eradicating
prejudice,
or
addressing
many
forms
of
racial
disparities,
including
economic
disparities
and
ongoing
disparities
in
healthcare
and
health
outcomes,
housing,
sentencing,
and
access
to
leadership
roles.
Critical
Race
Theory
investigates
the
multiple
pathways
that
maintain
racial
categories,
racial
dif ferentiation
and
racial
inequalities
and
consider
the
possibilities
and
limits
of
legal
interventions
for
addressing
discrimination.
Questions
about
other
forms
of
interventions
-
social,
cultural,
interpersonal,
educational,
etc.-
have
been
sparked
by
interdisciplinary
readings
of
CR T .
Many
of
us
work
in
fields
informed
by
this
scholarship
but
do
not
consider
ourselves
Critical
Race
Theorists,
as
this
is
a
form
of
specialization
and
expertise
that
must
be
earned.
Current
CR T
projects
may
ask
“why
do
we
continue
to
document
racial
discrimination,
almost
60
years
after
the
1964
Civil
Rights
Act?
What
else
can
we
do
to
address
discrimination
in
our
communities?”
These
questions
are
aligned
with
the
stated
goals
of
LD
614.
K-12
students
must
understand
foundational
concepts
about
race
as
a
social
concept
to
be
ready
to
learn
at
the
college
level.
CR T
serves
as
a
framework
to
depersonalize
conversations
about
race
and
racism,
shifting
the
focus
of
inquiry
away
from
individuals
and
toward
historical
structures
and
persistent
patterns.
Most
of
us
do
not
engage
CR T
scholarship
formally ,
but
may
find
the
orientation
of
questioning
useful
for
addressing
bias
in
our
own
lives
and
communities.
What
Is
Social
and
Emotional
Learning?
Social
and
emotional
learning
(SEL)
recognizes
that
students
need
to
regulate
their
emotions
to
be
“ready
to
learn.”
Building
skills
for
navigating
our
tempers,
learning
to
share,
learning
patience,
navigating
separation
anxiety ,
and
developing
the
skills
for
friendship
are
simply
part
of
all
young
children’ s
development.
The
ability
to
understand
ourselves
and
each
other ,
and
work
in
groups,
is
simply
a
core
21st
century
competency
and
it
is
hard
to
imagine
K-12
curricula
not
including
this
element.
As
a
parent.
I
am
extremely
grateful
that
SEL
grew
as
a
field.
My
eldest
daughter
was
so
smart
but
so
shy
as
a
young
child.
All
of
her
academic
energy
might
have
gone
to
hiding
if
teachers
had
not
worked
with
her
and
with
all
the
children
on
navigating
the
social
space
of
school.
She
graduated
from
Brown
University
and
currently
works
as
a
software
engineer
-
and
I
credit
the
support
she
got
as
a
young
child
with
her
current
success.
I
could
teach
her
to
read
but
I
could
not
teach
her
to
navigate
working
with
dif ferent
kinds
of
teachers
or
other
kids
–
that
is
a
core
project
of
school.
As
a
faculty
member ,
I
wish
to
see
more
SEL
curricula
for
Maine
students.
College
students
who
cannot
understand
themselves
as
learners
and
self-regulate
cannot
cope
well
with
the
transition
to
higher
ed.
Students
need
to
know
how
to
manage
their
stress
and
anxieties,
how
to
make
new
friends,
how
to
ef fectively
participate
in
group
discussions
and
how
to
manage
their
tempers
to
be
successful
in
college.
Addressing
the
Prohibitions:
A.
One
race
or
sex
is
inherently
better
than
another
race
or
sex;
This
seems
to
be
a
core
value
in
our
Country
and
State
and
certainly
a
value
reflected
in
Critical
Race
Theory .
CR T
asks,
“why
and
how
do
we
maintain
social
inequalities
when
we
collectively
agree
that
there
is
not
a
race
of
sex
inherently
better
than
another?”.
This
point
actually
encourages
more
Critical
Race
Theory
in
our
curriculum.
B.
By
virtue
of
the
individual's
race
or
sex,
an
individual
is
inherently
racist,
sexist
or
oppressive,
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously;
What
does
“inherently”
mean?
CR T
and
most
social
science
research
on
inequality
focuses
on
the
structural,
policy ,
and
psychological
conditions
that
encourage
or
discourage
patterns
of
prejudice
and
discrimination.
Psychological
and
behavioral
science
research
on
implicit
bias
does
not
ascribe
inherence,
but
rather
looks
to
understand
how
and
why
our
brains
maintain
“fast”
associations
that
reflect
prejudices
when
our
slower
consciousness
might
wish
to
emphasize
dif ferent
criteria.
Conscious
and
unconscious
patterns
of
bias
are
important
to
understand
so
that
we
can
change
our
responses
that
reflect
these
biases.
Again,
understanding
and
applying
learnings
from
these
bodies
of
literature
seem
consistent
with
the
goal
of
reducing
bias
in
school.
(W ork
by
Jennifer
Eberhardt,
PhD
or
Project
Implicit
at
Harvard
are
good
introductions
to
this
field)
C.
An
individual
should
be
discriminated
against
or
receive
adverse
treatment
solely
or
partly
because
of
the
individual's
race
or
sex;
This
is
a
strawhorse
argument,
given
Maine
Human
Rights
Laws
that
prohibit
discrimination
based
on
race
or
sex
or
other
protected
classes.
T o
ensure
this,
this
Legislature
is
encouraged
to
enthusiastically
support
LD
1619
which
would
enshrine
these
protections
in
Maine’ s
constitution!
CR T
does
not
encourage
adverse
treatment
of
any
racial
group,
and
in
fact
exists
to
root
out
the
places
where
racist
adverse
treatment
remains
despite
our
civil
rights
laws.
D.
Members
of
one
race
or
sex
cannot
and
should
not
attempt
to
treat
others
without
respect
to
race
or
sex;
This
seems
to
assert
that
we
should
embrace
“color
blindness”
and
no
sex
dif ferentiation?
Significant
literature
on
healthy
child
development
argues
for
acknowledging
our
social
dif ferences
as
part
of
our
identity
formation.
W e
all
care
about
dif ferent
parts
of
our
heritage
and
we
deserve
to
be
treated
with
respect
in
our
dif ferences.
Cultural
and
racial
awareness
and
literacy
are
essential
21st
century
skills.
With
regard
to
treating
others
dif ferently
without
respect
to
sex
–
do
supporters
of
LD
618
actually
embrace
sex-blindness?
While
some
preschools
in
Sweden
discourage
sex
dif ferentiation,
this
has
not
been
a
popular
move
in
the
United
States.
It
seems
unlikely
that
advocates
for
this
bill
genuinely
want
teachers
prohibited
from
acknowledging
sex
dif ferences
in
the
classroom,
which
would
include
using
gendered
language
including
pronouns
of
any
kind,
maintaining
sex
segregated
activities
like
locker
rooms
and
sports?
Acknowledging
sex
and
gender
identities,
social
identity
categories
and
dif ferences
does
not
immediately
suggest
that
there
will
be
discrimination
based
on
those
categories.
Again,
projects
like
CR T
investigate
the
relationships
between
identity
categories
and
discrimination
and
propose
new
ways
to
dismantle
this
connection
without
denying
individual
identity
as
important
to
people.
E.
An
individual's
moral
character
is
necessarily
determined
by
the
individual's
race
or
sex;
I
begin
all
of
my
sociology
courses
with
the
caveat
“People
Are
Not
Patterns.”
CR T
and
other
social
science
investigates
patterns,
knowing
we
can
not
make
specific
deductions
from
these
patterns
but
that
understanding
patterns
is
essential
for
dismantling
structural
discrimination.
Individuals
are
not
social
systems;
we
can
condemn
white
supremacy
without
condemning
all
white
people,
we
can
condemn
the
Holocaust
without
condemning
all
Germans
or
Christians.
If
we
do
not
condemn
genocide,
human
rights
abuses,
or
systemic
discrimination
and
violence
we
are
failing
to
transmit
shared
core
values
-
the
values
of
“All
people
are
created
equally ,
and
the
value
to
the
right
to
life,
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness”
that
bind
our
social
contract
with
each
other .
Schools
are
not
intended
to
be
fully
values-free
spaces,
but
instead
to
reflect
the
cultural
values
of
our
society .
Condemning
white
supremacy ,
misogyny ,
Anti-semitism
and
other
forms
of
hatred
toward
identity
groups
should
be
agreeable
to
all
of
us,
and
is
in
fact
part
of
what
is
reflected
in
this
bill.
F .
An
individual
should
feel
discomfort,
guilt,
anguish
or
any
other
form
of
psychological
distress
solely
because
of
the
individual's
race
or
sex;
and
This
may
be
the
most
complicated
part
of
this
bill,
for
me.
It
is
straightforward
to
assert
that
no
one
should
be
taught
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
for
our
race
or
sex.
However ,
a
long
history
of
sexism
has
taught
students
to
feel
shame
if
they
step
outside
of
relatively
narrow
“boxes”
of
gender
expression,
especially
during
middle
school.
Dress
codes,
for
example,
can
cause
psychological
distress
for
students,
yet
are
often
understood
to
be
necessary
for
the
collective.
It
seems
to
me
that
many
experience
discomfort
at
school
based
on
race,
sex,
gender
expression,
and
other
protected
categories
and
addressing
this
is
essential
for
youth
mental
health.
However ,
policing
individual
teachers
to
understand
who
and
how
misogyny
or
racism
is
expressed
in
this
way
seems
to
be
an
invitation
for
significant
conflict
and
controversy .
I
hope
and
believe
that
the
majority
of
teachers
are
doing
their
best
in
this
challenging
environment,
and
will
continue
to
seek
new
information
and
resources
to
address
disparities
in
mental
health
by
race
and
sex
(see
the
Y outh
Health
Survey
results).
Curiously ,
attention
to
this
would
be
understood
as
social
and
emotional
learning.
G.
Meritocracy
or
traits,
such
as
having
a
work
ethic,
are
racist
or
sexist
or
were
created
by
members
of
a
particular
race
to
oppress
members
of
another
race.
This
prohibition
is
simply
too
general.
If
we
cannot
teach
that
some
traits
come
out
of
racist
and
sexist
traditions,
we
simply
cannot
teach
history .
Y et
most
of
our
history
is
about
how
rules
denying
particular
groups
participation
in
an
activity
created
disparities
-
the
lack
of
a
true
meritocracy
the
problem.
For
example,
I
cannot
teach
about
why
women
didn’t
run
the
Boston
Marathon
until
1967
without
teaching
that
sports
purposely
denied
women
access
until
Katherine
Switzer
participated
despite
rules
barring
her
–
this
is
a
story
of
how
the
trait
of
marathon
running
seemed
to
be
unique
to
men
because
of
how
the
rules
were
created
and
that
the
changing
of
the
rules
changed
how
we
understand
the
sport.
T oday
men
and
women
are
equally
represented
and
the
marathon
enrolls
nonbinary
runners
as
well.
Exploring
how
the
structure
of
marathons
might
reflect
sexist
biases
because
women
were
excluded
at
their
formation
invites
design
thinking
to
update
the
sport
to
address
the
needs
of
all
participants
-
again
a
crucial
response
to
point
C
in
this
bill.
Understanding
that
social
traits
might
reflect
dominant
group
interests,
habits
or
practices
and
those
traits
might
change
over
time
or
place
is
an
essential
element
of
social
studies.
Curiosity
in
cultural
dif ferences
and
the
capacity
to
learn
from
others
and
adapt
ourselves
for
new
situations
and
challenges
is
a
part
of
our
development
we
need
to
foster .
SEL
helps
us
prepare
for
growth
into
adulthood,
where
we
will
be
asked
to
navigate
a
variety
of
social
spaces.
Preventing
conversation
about
dif ferences,
about
social
inequalities,
about
pathways
to
more
equality
and
inclusion,
and
about
how
to
understand
our
feelings
and
regulate
our
behavior
in
public
will
stunt
our
children’ s
ability
to
navigate
their
future.
Beyond
simply
refusing
LD
618,
I
hope
you
will
consider
the
importance
of
public
conversations
about
identity ,
inclusion
and
belonging
so
that
we
prevent
the
continued
conflation
of
these
terms
and
ideas
in
our
local
districts,
and
so
that
we
protect
teachers
and
school
systems
trying
to
navigate
the
complexity
of
public
space
where
everyone
has
a
right
to
learn.
Thank
you,
