LD 618
My name is Abby Treadwell, and I am a science teacher at Kennebunk High School. 
It is my firm belief that the proposed bill LD 618 is an incredibly dangerous and 
regressive act of legislation. It goes back on the years of progress we have made as a 
state and nation towards racial equality. Additionally, it threatens the future of 
minority groups at a time when they are already at risk. I urge the Committee to vote 
against this oppressive legislature.
