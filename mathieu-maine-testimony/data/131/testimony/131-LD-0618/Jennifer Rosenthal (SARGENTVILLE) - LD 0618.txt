LD 618
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. 
My name is Jen Rosenthal
I am testifying against LD 618.
First I would like to say that I find this proposed bill would be one more way that 
shows educators that we are not supporting them and the important work they have 
been trained to do in educating our children. In a time when educators are leaving the 
profession and letting us know they don't feel supported this feels like just another 
way that they would be targeted and micromanaged. 
I have three children in school here in Maine. No one is teaching our kids critical race
theory in elementary and high schools. That is completely made up to trigger people 
who don't know different. A false talking point that is frankly getting very old.  I am 
learning about aspects of it in my masters program but my elementary age kids are 
certainly not. 
They are learning kindness and empathy for others. They are learning that there are 
different cultures and people. They are learning about respect for different people's 
identities, beliefs, and cultures and that there is so much about all humans that we 
share in common. That is what I want them to learn so they can be good humans and 
respect other people. So they can have curiosity about the world and knowledge about
history from multiple perspectives. 
This bill is badly worded, badly researched, lacks coherence, and contradicts itself. I 
think it's a shame it entered even this early part of the process. This bill will do 
nothing but make it harder for our teachers. This needs to die in committee.
Thank you,
Jen Rosenthal
