Good
afternoon
Senat or

Repr esentativ e
Br ennan,
and

the
Joint
Standing

My
name
is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
writing
in
str ong
opposition
t o
LD
618,
“ An
Act
t o
Eliminate
Critical
Race
Theor y ,
Social
and
Emotional
Learning
and
Div ersity ,
E quity
and
Inclusion
fr om
School
Curricula. ”
It
is
clear
fr om
r eading
this
bill
that
its
sponsor
has
v er y
little
understanding
of
the
concepts
he
is
attempting
t o
ban.
Div ersity ,
equity
and
inclusion
is
not
co v er ed
in
any
of
this
bill’ s
deﬁnitions.
Ensuring
that
e v er y
student
f eels
saf e
and
included
at
school
is
just
common
sense.
Kids
can ’t
learn
if
the y
don ’t
f eel
lik e
the y
belong.
Social
and
emotional
learning
(SEL)
is
also
not
co v er ed
in
any
of
this
bill’ s
deﬁnitions.
SEL
is
critically
impor tant
t o
the
success
and
r esilience
of
our
students.
It
has
become
clear
r ecently
how
many
adults
don 't
ha v e
the
social
skills
needed
t o
inter act
appr opriately
with
others
and
how
many
don 't
ha v e
the
ability
t o
r ecogniz e
and
r egulate
their
emotions.
If
these
ar e
the
par ents
and
gr andpar ents
that
kids
ar e
learning
fr om
at
home
then
it
is
critical
that
we
teach
these
skills
at
school.
Critical
Race
Theor y
is
an
academic
concept
that
is
explor ed
in
law
school,
not
pK -12
education.

Thank

for

time.
