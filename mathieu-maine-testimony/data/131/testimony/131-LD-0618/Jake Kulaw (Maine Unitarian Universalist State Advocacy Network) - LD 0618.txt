Dear
Senator
Rafferty,
Representative
Brennan
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural
Affairs
Committee,
My
name
is
Jake
Kulaw,
I
am
speaking
on
behalf
of
MUUSAN
(Maine
Unitarian
Universalist
State
Advocacy
Network)
and
as
an
educator
with
27
years
of
experience.
I
urge
you
to
oppose
the
passage
of
LD
618,
An
Act
to
Eliminate
Critical
Race
Theory,
Social
Emotional
Learning
and
Diversity,
Equity
and
Inclusion
from
School
Curricula.
UU
congregations
linked
through
the
MUUSAN
network
share
core
values
that
include
honoring
the
inherent
worth
and
dignity
of
every
person,
supporting
and
striving
for
justice,
equity
and
compassion
in
all
human
relations,
and
promoting
the
free
and
responsible
search
for
truth
and
meaning.
We
recognize
that
our
students
need
adults
who
will
honor
their
worth
and
recognize
their
ability
to
learn
accurate
history,
even
painful
history.
If
they
are
not
taught
these
truths,
we
are
bound
to
repeat
the
mistakes
that
exploration
of
that
history
could
have
revealed.
Youth
are
rising
up
and
saying
loudly
and
clearly,
please
tell
us
the
truth.
As
a
UU
and
as
an
educator
I
am
adding
my
voice.
In
this
unprecedented
time
of
uncertainty,
our
students
need
accurate
information
and
courageous
conversations.
Critical
Race
Theory
is
not
being
taught
at
K-12
schools,
it
is
a
theoretical
tool
that
began
in
law
schools
in
an
attempt
to
explain
racial
inequity.
Our
children
receive
messages
about
race
all
the
time,
from
books,
games,
movies,
television,
teachers,
friends,family,
neighbors
and
peers.
They
notice
patterns
around
race
and
gender,
among
other
identities.
School
is
a
place
to
learn,
not
just
selective
pieces
of
our
history
but
all
of
it.
“Students
deserve
an
honest
understanding
of
our
history
and
its
episodes
of
both
greatness
and
shame
if
we
hope
to
learn
from
our
past”
(Joy
Hofmeister,
Oklahoma
State
Superintendent).
BU
psychologist
Evan
Apfelbaum
suggests
that
the
majority
of
adults
in
the
U.S.
have
false
perceptions
about
how
and
when
kids
learn
about
race.
Adults
assume
children
are
too
young
to
be
aware
of
race.
In
fact,
children
as
young
as
6
months
can
be
aware
of
racial
differences.
Social
emotional
learning
is
crucial
in
the
lives
of
our
youth.
SEL
is
the
process
through
which
an
individual
acquires
and
applies
knowledge
and
skills
to
develop
a
healthy
identity
and
includes
emotional
regulation,
empathy
and
interpersonal
skills.
This
enables
them
to
be
successful
at
school
and
in
their

community.
We
have
seen
an
increase
in
anxiety
and
depression
in
students
across
Maine
and
the
country.
As
an
educator
I
saw
first
hand
how
learning
and
practicing
these
skills
benefited
students.
According
to
a
meta-analysis
of
213
rigorous
studies,
students
who
receive
high
quality,
evidence-based
SEL
programming
demonstrate
better
academic
performance,
improved
attitudes
and
behaviors;
greater
motivation
to
learn,
deeper
commitment
to
school,
better
classroom
behavior;
reduced
emotional
distress,
fewer
reports
of
of
student
depression,
anxiety,
stress
and
social
withdrawal.
Furthermore,
several
longitudinal
studies
found
that
participation
in
an
SEL
program
had
a
lasting
impact
on
these
outcomes
up
to
18
years
later
regardless
of
their
race,
socioeconomic
background
or
school
location.
Did
you
know
that
according
to
an
ipsos
poll
(2022)
for
Parents
Together,
huge
majorities
of
Americans
believe
that
lessons
about
the
history
of
racism,
rather
than
being
harmful
to
children,
prepare
children
to
build
a
better
future
for
everyone.
86%
of
Independents,
95%
of
Democrats
and
76%
of
Republicans
to
be
precise.
An
8th
grade
student
said,
“
If
we
don’t
understand
our
history,
we
can
never
make
things
better.”
In
closing,
I
urge
you
to
vote
Ought
Not
to
Pass
on
LD
618.
It
would
have
a
negative
impact
on
student
learning
and
well-being.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
Sincerely,
Jake
Kulaw
