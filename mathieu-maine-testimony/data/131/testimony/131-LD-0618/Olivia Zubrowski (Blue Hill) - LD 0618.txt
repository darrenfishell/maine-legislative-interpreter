Eliminating materials that discuss critical race theory, social and emotional learning, 
diversity, equity, and inclusion is a disservice to Maine students. These materials 
benefit everyone! Fundamentally, eliminating these materials means that students will
not see themselves, in their full complexity, reflected in their course materials. Seeing
yourself reflected in a diverse history of leaders/thinkers/artists empowers students to 
feel more confident in who they are. These materials will ensure students will be 
better informed for tough discussions around biases, discrimination, inequity, and be 
better prepared to dismantle such biases in themselves and others. These materials are
vital to a well-rounded education, and if these kinds of materials are removed from 
schools, we are failing our students.
