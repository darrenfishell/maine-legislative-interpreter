LD 618
 I am writing to urge the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee to REJECT LD 
618 An Act to Eliminate Critical Race Theory, Social and Emotional Learning and 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion from School Curricula. Like many such acts, this one 
demonstrates little understanding of  the forms of thought and pedagogy that it 
purports to eliminate. Critical race theory is not meant to denigrate individuals. 
Rather, it is used to understand how _systems_ of injustice -- such as racism and 
sexism -- intersect and are employed toward oppression. Legislators should not be 
fooled into thinking that our children are at any risk when educators discuss issues of 
racism, sexism, or other forms of social injustice in our schools. Acts such as LD 618 
are meant to protect white supremacy, patriarchy, and heteronormativity, plain and 
simple, and have no place in our state.
