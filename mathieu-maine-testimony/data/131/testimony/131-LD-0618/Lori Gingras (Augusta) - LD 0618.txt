Augusta
LD 618
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Lori Gingras. I live and work in central Maine. I am a high school 
English teacher and mother of two teen boys. 
I oppose LD 618: An Act to Eliminate Critical Race Theory, Social and Emotional 
Learning and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion from School Curricula. 
The wording of the bill is vague. If passed, this bill would endanger Maine students: 
academically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps physically. Censorship has no place 
in Maine schools!
Sincerely,
Lori Gingras
