LD 618
As a Maine parent who raised both of my children in Brunswick and who saw them 
attend and thrive in public schools, I strongly object to passage of LD 618.
To begin with: “Critical Race Theory” is is not “taught” in our public schools. It is a 
legal term that denotes that systemic racism is part of American society. Critical Race 
Theory recognizes that racism is more than the result of individual bias and prejudice.
As a result, LD 618 is utterly incoherent. What exactly does it “forbid?” Does the 
bill’s author honestly believe that Maine school teachers are introducing our kids to 
legal concepts usually taught in law school?
That said: Maine is the whitest state in the nation. My children benefitted from 
thought provoking programs and books that introduced them to a variety of cultures, 
races and religions, and taught them to be empathetic, compassionate and critical 
thinkers, prepared to encounter a diverse world beyond the borders of their beloved 
Maine home.
