LD 618
I oppose the passing of LD 618. It is important for children, especially in a 
predominantly white state, like Maine, to learn about race, diversity, equity, and the 
correct history of their country. Systemic racism is part of American history and still 
exists in modern society. These issues should not be hidden or ignored, but rather 
taught properly in order to examine the inequities that exist within this country so we 
can rebuild them equitably. Hiding these issues from our children will not change our 
history, nor aid in building a better future for all Americans.
