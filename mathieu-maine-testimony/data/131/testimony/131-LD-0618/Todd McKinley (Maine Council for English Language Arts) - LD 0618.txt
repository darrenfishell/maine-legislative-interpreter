Todd McKinley
Maine Council for English Language Arts
LD 618
â€œSenator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Todd McKinley 
and I am the Vice President, representing the Maine Council for English Language 
Arts.
MCELA opposes LD 618. This proposed act is unnecessary for a number of reasons. 
First, Critical Race Theory is not taught in any public school in Maine. Such a course 
requires specialized training on the part of instructors, and students generally 
approach such a study at the collegiate level. Second, this bill is a misguided attempt 
to attack the intellectual freedom of educators, students, and communities who desire 
to consider ways in which systemic racism exists within the history of this country. 
Third, this bill attempts to limit the ability of teachers and staff to address the social 
emotional needs of their students, needs which have significantly increased in the 
years since emergency remote learning during the COVID pandemic.
For these reasons, I strongly urge the Committee to vote unanimously ought not to 
pass.
