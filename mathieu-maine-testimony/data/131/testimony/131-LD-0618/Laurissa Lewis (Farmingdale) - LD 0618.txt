LD 618
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Educational and 
Cultural Affairs Committee, I would like to submit testimony today against LD 618. 
The teaching Critical Race Theory is not something being taught in public schools. 
However, educators are well within their rights and should be applauded for 
addressing racism head on and teaching students how racism has played a role and 
continues to play a role in the history of the United States. It's factual and important 
and it is something that our children deserve to understand lest they live on to repeat 
it.
 Social Emotional Learning (SEL) courses are a vital aspect of education today. Turn 
on the news any given day and you are likely to see a school or other mass shooting 
has occurred somewhere in the country. We are very lost as a society. Students need 
guidance and to be taught how to advocate for themselves and others, this is learning 
that is not happening in many homes. I read a statistic that for every dollar spent on 
SEL education, the return is $11 due to the positive impacts of the programs. Please 
vote ought not to pass on LD 618.
