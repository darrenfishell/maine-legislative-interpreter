LD 618
I am vehemently opposed to LD618.
There are so many reasons not to allow this bill to even pass out of Committee, let 
alone become law, that I will only identify a few:
- Critical Race Theory (CRT) is not taught in any K-12 school system in the country, 
let alone Maine. It is a college graduate-level, legal, and academic framework used to 
analyze the impacts of race on society. It does not need to be banned in Maine 
schools.
- Social/Emotional Learning (SEL) is simply a way of introducing students to 
self-awareness, self-control, and the interpersonal skills they will need as they 
progress through school and life. It should not be banned in Maine schools.
- Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) instruction is simply a way of introducing 
students to the idea that (to paraphrase the Declaration of Independence) "all people 
are created equal". It should not be banned in Maine schools.
- The potential for litigation arising from this bill is enormous and the cost to Maine 
school systems would be significant. If passed, the Fiscal Impact should be covered 
by the state, not local entities.
- The bill assumes that teachers and other professionals are incapable of gauging what
curricula is appropriate for their students.
Maine's motto is "Dirigo" (I direct or lead). For the first state in the union to approve 
same-sex marriage by popular vote to be put in the position of considering this 
backward legislation is very disturbing.
