I strongly oppose LD 618
Critical Race Theory is "actual true history" and what I want my children to be 
learning.  Ignorance is not bliss, but just ignorance in this case.  Learning about ALL 
of our history, the good, the bad and the ugly, will teach us also to learn from our past
mistakes and grow together as a better society.
