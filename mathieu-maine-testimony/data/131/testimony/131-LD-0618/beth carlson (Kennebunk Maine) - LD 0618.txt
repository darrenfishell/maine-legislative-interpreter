LD 618

“Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Beth Carlson and
I am an English teacher at RSU21 and a member of the Maine Council for English 
Language Arts. I am writing because I oppose LD 618.
 
Here in Maine we pride ourselves on local control.  We also have traditionally had a 
culture that valued a live and let live sentiment.  This law goes against both of these 
values.  It also would impose the will of a few on the majority citizens of this state.
Because we were founded as a Christian nation, albeit one with a separation of church
and state, one traditional value is the golden rule.  Do unto others as you would have 
them do unto you.  Part of this bill restricts the teaching of social emotional learning, 
and diversity, equity and inclusion.  These very things fall under this golden rule. 
Who would actually argue a school should limit student self-awareness, mental health
services, and the inclusion of all people? In addition, bullets A to G in the bill are 
simply incorrect and reveal ignorance of what schools actually do.  In fact, so 
ignorant, there’s really nothing to argue. This proposal is fear-based and inaccurate.
This bill is simply not representative of what is taught in Maine at all, and I am asking
you to please unanimously vote not to pass LD618.
Sincerely, 
Beth Carlson
