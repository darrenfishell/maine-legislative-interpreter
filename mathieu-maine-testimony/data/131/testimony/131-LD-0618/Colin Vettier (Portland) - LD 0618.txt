LD 618
Dear Committee, 
My name is Colin Vettier and I'm a Portland resident. 
I am appalled at yet another attempt to blindside our youth. Education should not be a 
political tool to ensure our children remain ignorant. 
If our politics were genuinely interested in educating the next generation, they would 
fund public education or better yet, they would become teachers. In the meantime, 
they should leave it to the professional to decide what is valuable educational 
material. 
I am against LD 618 and I hope that the committee will understand that banning 
subjects from schools is another step away from freedom and democracy.
