LD 618
My name is Casey Rosenthal
I am testifying against LD 618.
Any theory that provides accurate historical context to help students understand how 
the world around us came about, is a positive contribution to critical thinking and 
civic engagement. CRT is one such theory. In consideration of Representative Jeffrey 
Adams bringing this issue to our attention, I would like to see a bill or referendum in 
support of CRT, Social and Emotional Learning, and DEI to be a required component 
of school curricula in all Maine schools. It would bring me great joy and pride to 
think of the strong social fabric that our state would cultivate if our children were 
taught basic tenets of empathy toward people of all backgrounds, and how to identify 
and combat systemic injustices that threaten equality.
Sincerely,
Casey Rosenthal
