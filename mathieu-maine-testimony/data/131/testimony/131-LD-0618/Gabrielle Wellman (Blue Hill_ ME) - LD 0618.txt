"An Act to Eliminate Critical Race Theory, Social and Emotional Learning and 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion from School Curricula
Dear Members of the Educational and Cultural Affairs Committee,
I am writing to thank you for serving on this committee.  I believe you are doing so to
further the good of education for all members of society and to spread the knowledge 
of humankind for the greater good and harmony of all.
It is with these thoughts in mind that I write to strongly urge you to reject his bill, LD 
618, which seems to go against these desires in us to make accessible learning 
available to all and to learn to think critically and not just accept what is told to us.  
This bill would appear to go against free speech and be in opposition to education.  
Let us not support it!
Respectfully submitted,
gabrielle wellman
