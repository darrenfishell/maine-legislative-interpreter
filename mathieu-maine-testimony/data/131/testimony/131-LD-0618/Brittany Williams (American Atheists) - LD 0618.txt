While this legislation purports to prevent racial stereotyping, its effect will be to limit diversity education, prevent discussion of structural racism, and ultimately result in a censored view of American history. American Atheists believes that our nation’s schools should promote critical thinking, limit censorship, and prevent the white-washing of racial and religious history. We urge you to stand up for the education of our young people and oppose this harmful bill.   American Atheists is a national civil rights organization that works to achieve religious equality for all Americans by protecting what Thomas Jefferson called the “wall of separation” between government and religion created by the First Amendment. We strive to create an environment where atheism and atheists are accepted as members of our nation’s communities and where casual bigotry against our community is seen as abhorrent and unacceptable. We promote understanding of atheists through education, outreach, and community-building and work to end the stigma associated with being an atheist in America. As advocates for religious equality and free speech, American Atheists objects to efforts to censor history and undermine diversity education.  The impact of bills like LD 618 filed around the country goes beyond just the bill text. These vague bills create fear among well-meaning educators and employees. For example, a Texas administrator, fearing being penalized under similar legislation recently passed in his state, instructed teachers that they must teach both sides of the Holocaust.1  At the same time, these  1 NBCUniversal News Group.

Recent survey research5 confirms that a broad bipartisan majority of Americans:  ● Want students to learn a thorough, accurate, and fact-based account of American history; ● Trust teachers to thoughtfully teach the hard parts of history; ● Believe racism is widespread and harmful to society and that schools have a responsibility to teach students that racism is wrong; ● Want to reduce political division; and ● Want schools to ensure all students feel they belong and see themselves reflected in the curriculum.   Teaching about the issues of the day, including matters that actually affect the lives of students and their families, can be an important way to invest students in their education and to connect the subjects they are studying to issues of significance in our nation’s public discourse. Teachers, especially in areas like civics, social studies, and history, have a responsibility to teach critical thinking and to prepare students for full participation in our society and democracy. Deep engagement with so-called controversial subjects, including legislation or policies that affect the education of students themselves, can be an important way to encourage democratic participation and to bring these sometimes-abstract subjects to life.   This bill would incentivize a censored teaching of our nation’s history, tie the hands of the educators we trust, and could virtually eliminate discussions of structural racism. The quality of instruction, critical thinking skills of students, and sense of belonging of all students will suffer, and it will worsen the already poor diversity education offered in many schools. This bill will harm Maine students, and it is being driven by political, rather than educational, interests. We urge you to reject LD 618. Rather than attempting to silence history, trust and equip your teachers and educational institutions to do the important work of digging into difficult  newhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/southlake-texas-holocaust-books-schools-rcna2965s/southlake-texas-holocaust-books-schools-rcna2965.   2 Gross, J.
