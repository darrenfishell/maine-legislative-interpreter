LD 618
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee: 
I'm writing to ask you to vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 618: An Act to Eliminate 
Critical Race Theory, Social and Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion from School Curricula
First, Critical Race Theory is a graduate level concept not taught in any public Pre-K 
through 12 schools anywhere in Maine.  The belief otherwise is completely 
unsupported by facts.  
Second, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in schools is necessary.  Maine's immigrant 
population is growing.  Our schools are becoming more racially and culturally diverse
all the time.  Our understanding of gender and sexuality is also growing which leads 
to a larger variety of students self identifying outside the cisgendered heterosexual 
majority.  Teaching that “we're all the same on the inside” ignores important 
differences and can makes minorities feel like outsiders.  Children who do not feel 
like they belong in school cannot learn.   Only when we acknowledge our differences 
are we able to call out and eradicate discrimination. 
Finally, Social Emotional Learning has become an absolute must.  Self awareness, 
problem solving, communication, decision making and relationship building are the 
building blocks for success in any career path.  In a time where our nation is 
experiencing a mental health crisis SEL provides prevention tools for our children.
Thank you for your consideration
