Are any school curriculums in Maine teaching children it's not ok to be white or 
male? Is this truly a valid or reality based concern to be presented to the committee? 
Any accurate discussion of the history of this country (or any other country) is going 
to contain uncomfortable information about how people have been treated according 
to their race, gender, or economic and social status. If we cannot view the past with 
clear eyes and discuss it honestly and with compassion, we will not grow as a society.
I question who this bill is designed to "protect." Let Maine resist falling into the trap 
of ignorance and disinformation we are seeing elsewhere in this country.
