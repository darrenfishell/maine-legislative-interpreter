LD 618 
 
Members of the Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, this is testimony AGAINST LD 
618.  
I almost don’t know where to start. First, Critical Race Theory is not being taught in Maine 
public schools. CRT is a graduate-level academic set of tools developed (and still evolving) over 
the past 40 years. It is used to understand why racial inequality has persisted even after the civil 
rights legislation of two generations ago. It is used to analyze systems in government, academia, 
and industry and has been critical of all parts of the political spectrum. It uses tools and 
techniques far too advanced for Maine public schools, and is designed to analyze, not to promote 
any one point of view. To imply that it does anything other than that is a smear on the names of 
many ethical academic analysts.  
For Maine public schools, points A through G are a mishmash of points that either don’t apply to 
CRT or are reflective of the presenter’s point of view, which seems, at best, misinformed and, at 
worst, resistant to the teaching of historical facts.  
Please protect public education and vote AGAINST this bill. Thank you.
