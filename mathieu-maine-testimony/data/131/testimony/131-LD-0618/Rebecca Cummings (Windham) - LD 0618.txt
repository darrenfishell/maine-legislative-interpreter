LD 618
I write in SUPPORT of LD618. I believe it's in inherently cruel and racist to proclaim
one group of individuals are perpetual victims or oppressed while everyone else is 
deemed "privileged" or oppressors.
CRT & DEI label individuals based on circumstances outside an individual's control 
(race, biological sex, etc.) versus their content of character. This ideology does 
nothing to improve race relations and only causes further division.
LD618 Ought Pass!!!!
