LD 618
Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
I am writing to you today in opposition of LD 618, An Act to Eliminate Critical Race 
Theory, Social Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion from School 
Curricula. 
As an Elementary School Counselor, I teach social emotional skills to students. It aids
in building important skills such as self-awareness, social awareness, the ability to 
build healthy relationships, and responsible decision-making skills. 
That this bill is being brought to committee during the month of May, which is 
coincidentally Mental Health Awareness Month, is ill-conceived. Social Emotional 
Learning supports the mental health and overall well-being of students. During a time 
where mental health visits for children in the emergency room are increasing, we 
cannot remove SEL, diversity, equity and inclusion material from the curriculum. It 
would be a disservice to our children who need more access to mental health help, not
less.
Thank you for taking the time to review my testimony in opposition to LD 618.
