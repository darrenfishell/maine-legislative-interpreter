Maine schools are at its lowest academic ratings in our history.  
Only 24% of Maine students can do math at proficiency and only 29% of students can
read at proficiency.  The worst scores ever!

Why are schools spending one dollar and one minute on leftist political training of 
students is beyond me.  
Why is this committee allowing it!?
CRT, hyper-sexualization of minors, social emotional learning, whole child, itâ€™s all 
leftist political indoctrination. 
It needs to stop and every taxpayer dollar and moment needs to get back to the basics 
of education.   
I ask that this bill passes committee, for the students of Maine.
