The title of this legislation is loaded with the trigger words with nothing specifically 
defining any of them.  Who decides what is acceptable?  Which schools are even 
discussing “Critical Race Theory”, etc.?  Where is the proof in any of the school’s 
curricula?  Explain specifically what the intention is for this legislation and who is 
behind it.  Is there suddenly something wrong with treating people with kindness and 
respect regardless of their race or sex? Why is parentsrightsmaine.org website devoid 
of any information? Who is funding this group?
