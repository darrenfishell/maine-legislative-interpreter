Dear Honorable Legislators,
As a teacher and advisor at a town academy in Maine, I am very concerned about 
limiting schools freedom to address students' needs and learning in the areas of race, 
gender, physical ability, and socio-economic diversity.  At our school we value open 
conversation and free speech regarding these issues because students from a wide 
variety of backgrounds wish to learn from each other in an educational atmosphere 
where they will not fear backlash from people with opposing political beliefs.
We are trying to teach students about the hard history of our country and our world, 
including racism, sexism, genderism and other cultural norms which impact our social
structures past, present and future.  It is not in my mind "protection" to limit our 
students learning about these things until they encounter them first hand and have not 
had the opportunity to discern a civil response based on a variety of perspectives.
CRT, DEI and SEL are not tools of torture for anyone.  They should not be feared, but
allow us to see our world through lenses of those who have been victims of our social 
system that favored some over others based on physical characteristics and not on 
merit.
Please know that limiting the use of these theories and methods is a way to limit the 
opportunities our students have to grow and succeed.
