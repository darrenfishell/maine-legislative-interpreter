Representative Adams, having listened to the discussion of CRT in schools many 
times, I believe it is widely known that CRT is not taught outside of Universities. It 
was originally developed as a course in Law School, although has possibly been 
included in other majors. I am worried that there is a misunderstanding about about 
CRT- or, are you including your ban in universities as well? As far as DEI, it is 
possible for schools to teach the basics as well as the benefits of diversity, equity and 
inclusion. "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."-George 
Santayana, The Life of Reason, 1905. From the series Great Ideas of Western Man. 
As someone born in 1955, I am embarrassed that I never learned the true history of 
my country until recently. We gain nothing as a people by covering up the sins of our 
past. We become stronger if we evolve and learn to treat all with equal dignity, 
respect- and at the same time acknowledge that we have made mistakes. It's worth 
reading about what Germany has done in their country to openly discuss the horror of 
the 20th century- and, with hope- that this will never be repeated. Teaching DEI is not
teaching one race/gender/religion/sexual preference... is superior to another, to the 
contrary- it is to state all are equal. One can do this as well as acknowledge there are 
people who were shameful actors in our history- as a result of their thinking "they" 
were a superior group of people. It's the truth, it's our history. It should be taught. We 
can grow from this experience- and again, hope this won't be repeated.
