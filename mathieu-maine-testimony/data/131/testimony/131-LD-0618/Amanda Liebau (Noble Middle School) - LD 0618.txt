As an educator, I strongly oppose any efforts to eliminate critical race theory, social 
and emotional learning, and diversity, equity, and inclusion from school curricula. 
These educational frameworks are essential tools for helping students understand the 
world around them, develop empathy and critical thinking skills, and work towards 
building a more just and equitable society.
Critical race theory provides a lens through which we can examine the historical and 
contemporary impact of racism on our society. By exploring how systemic racism has
shaped our institutions, policies, and culture, students can gain a deeper understanding
of the challenges facing marginalized communities and develop the skills needed to 
address these challenges.
Social and emotional learning is also critical to the academic and personal growth of 
students. By fostering emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-awareness, students 
can develop the skills needed to navigate social relationships, manage stress and 
anxiety, and make responsible decisions.
Finally, diversity, equity, and inclusion are essential values that should be at the heart 
of our educational system. By recognizing and celebrating diversity in all its forms, 
we can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment that values the 
contributions of all students and fosters a sense of belonging.
Eliminating these important educational frameworks from our curricula would be a 
grave disservice to our students and our society as a whole. It would limit our 
students' ability to understand the world around them, develop critical thinking skills, 
and work towards building a more just and equitable society.
As educators, our role is to provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and 
values they need to succeed in life and make a positive impact on the world around 
them. Critical race theory, social and emotional learning, and diversity, equity, and 
inclusion are essential tools for achieving this goal, and we must continue to 
incorporate them into our curricula in order to ensure that our students are prepared to
face the challenges of the future.
In conclusion, eliminating critical race theory, social and emotional learning, and 
diversity, equity, and inclusion from school curricula would be a serious mistake. 
These frameworks are essential for helping our students understand the world around 
them, develop empathy and critical thinking skills, and work
