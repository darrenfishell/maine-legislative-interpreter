I am writing to protest very strongly LD#618,An act to eliminate critical race theory, 
etc.
 Although critical race theory is not in fact taught in Maine public schools, the 
concept of teaching about race and equity to our students is so vitally important to our
society today. Trying to pretend these issues do not exist and are not important is 
ludicrous. They should be an essential part of our education system. Please do not 
eliminate these.
Thank you for your time.
