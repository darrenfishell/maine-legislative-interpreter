LD 618
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, I am Laura Wittmann, and I 
am an ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages) teachers for Bangor School 
Department, and I am also a trilingual language speaker (English, Spanish and 
German). I am giving my personal testimony against Act 618 because I have seen the 
power of acknowledging and supporting students and their families in their diverse 
linguistic and cultural backgrounds as a way for people to feel as if they belong to a 
society. To pass a law that prohibits discussion of where people come from, what 
languages they or their grandparents speak, how people may feel when they are 
excluded or included from a group, denies the experiences of these people. The goals 
of public education are for students to be an informed citizen, to be a productive 
member of society, and for students to have options for their adult work life. If 
teachers and schools are cut off at the knees, and cannot bring to the classroom 
discussion how people are similar and different, based on their histories and 
experiences, students will not be able to be informed, and may not be willing to be a 
part of the productive adult work world. Please vote AGAINST LD 618.
