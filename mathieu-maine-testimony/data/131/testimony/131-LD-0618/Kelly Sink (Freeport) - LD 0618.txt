LD 618
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs:
My name is Kelly Sink and I am on the Board of Directors for RSU5 (submitting this 
testimony on my own behalf). I oppose LD #618 for the following reason:
The breadth and ambiguity of this Act to Eliminate Critical Race Theory, Social and 
Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion from School Curricula 
amounts to content- and viewpoint- based state censorship in education. This ban will 
have the effect of chilling academic and educational discussions around many aspects 
of historic, culture, and societal implications of race, social-emotional learning, 
diversity, equity, and inclusion. More specifically, this act will make it difficult to 
teach an accurate, comprehensive, and honest version of history and social studies. 
Although these types of bills seek to relieve students of discomfort that may result 
from discussion these topics, the very act of learning history in a free and multi-ethnic
society is inescapably fraught. Any accurate teaching of any countryâ€™s history could 
make some of its citizens feel uncomfortable or even guilty about the past. It is 
important to teach into these subjects nonetheless. Our students must learn how past 
history and policies have contributed to present-day inequities. Any sort of education 
that willfully neglects the teaching of these topics will create citizens who, not 
understanding the systemic foundations of inequities, will be unable or unwilling to 
take measures to correct them. To summarize, I believe that education in these areas 
is critical to producing citizens who are willing to contribute to society and 
democracy in a way that elevates opportunities and well-being for all in our 
communities. 
Therefore, I strongly urge the Committee to vote unanimously not to pass LD #618. 
Thank you.
Kelly Sink,
