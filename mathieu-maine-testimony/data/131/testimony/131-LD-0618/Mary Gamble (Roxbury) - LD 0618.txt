                        May 4, 2023  Senator Rafferty, Chair Representative Brennan, Chair Distinguished Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee  My name is Mary Gamble.  I am a resident of Roxbury, Maine and a school librarian.  I am submitting testimony in opposition to LD 618.   Critical race theory is not being taught in public schools.  Learning about one’s health and well-being and how to treat one another without discrimination is a standard and role model for functioning in society and in community.  Lifting up the value of all members of one’s community, historically and to present day is important and educational.  It is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, creed, or sexual orientation, therefore, students should be encouraged in their learning and in their behaviors to show empathy and understanding for all persons.  Funding for SEL in our district has been essential for students’ recovery from the setbacks from the recent pandemic years.  This bill would be damaging to students.  Please vote NO to LD 618.  Please direct questions or further discussion to:  marymartha725@gmail.com   Sincerely,    Mary Gamble
