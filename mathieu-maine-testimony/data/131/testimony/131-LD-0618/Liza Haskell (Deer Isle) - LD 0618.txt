My name is Liza Haskell, I have been an educator in the state of Maine for over 20 
years. In recent years, I have noticed more and more children who have challenging 
behaviors and struggle to express emotions successfully. The majority of my career 
has been spent assessing and implementing behavioral intervention plans.  While we 
strive to provide instruction that can replace maladaptive behaviors with more 
functional behaviors, a curriculum to address the underlying lack of skills in the social
emotional areas of development is necessary. Maine should be emphasizing and 
increasing these much needed areas of learning. It is outrageous that this bill targets 
eliminating such curriculum. It appears at this time, Maineâ€™s social emotional 
curriculum is already too limited, as it is online and optional. This committee should 
be working to increase the exposure to social emotional learning in public schools, 
not eliminate it for our young learners. In terms of diversity, equity and inclusion, 
many adults in the world today could benefit from learning about empathy, patience 
and civility. If this kind of education had been at the forefront of learning decades 
ago, perhaps we would live in a less polarized and callous society. I implore you to 
talk to educators, like me, before you propose to eliminate an already minimal system 
that might help our next generation become better citizens of our state and country. In
addition, what is the reason this has been proposed, what is the motivating factor? 
Teaching children that others may think and feel differently than they do and how to 
handle that with dignity and respect should be of crucial concern to us all. The only 
motivation I can imagine in this effort to keep our children ignorant of diversity is 
xenophobia.
