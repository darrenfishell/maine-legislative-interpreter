I’m writing in opposition of this bill. I am very concerned that anyone would consider
eliminating critical race theory, social and emotional learning and diversity, equity 
and inclusion from school curricula. We need to stop fear-mongering and making 
teaching the truth in schools while also supporting our children’s mental and 
emotional health when in a learning setting as a problem that needs to be solved. If 
anything this needs more focus and funding especially with all of the recent white 
supremacist activity it’s imperative we create a learning culture based in truth, 
understanding, diversity, equity, and inclusion. I hope this committee will do the right
thing and vote ought not to pass. Thank you.
