LD 618
To the Respected Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee: 
I am writing to register my opposition to LD 618, a bill that would adversely impact 
Maine children.
In one of the whitest states in the nation, it could be argued that Maine students need 
*more*, not less, education on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our country was 
founded on the economics of enslavement — it's a historical fact with modern day 
consequences. Our public education system is charged with preparing Maine students 
for post-secondary success in the workforce of the 21st century. They would be 
disadvantaged in a competitive, global workforce without an education that includes a
truthful history as well as inclusive curricula.
In a post-pandemic world, all students need *more* — not less! — education on 
self-management, emotions, and social thinking We're seeing behaviors in our 
students that are developmentally delayed, again due to the pandemic — mirrored in 
schools all over the nation. High school students who are displaying behaviors more 
common in pre-pandemic middle schools. Middle school students who are less mature
and less socially capable as their pre-pandemic peers. 
Thank you for considering my testimony.
