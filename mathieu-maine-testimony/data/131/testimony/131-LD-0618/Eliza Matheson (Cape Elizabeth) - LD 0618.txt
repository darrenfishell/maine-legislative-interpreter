LD 618
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs:
LD 618 has got to be the most ridiculous bill to come across your desks yet. Eliminate
Social and Emotional Learning? I would like to know how many of the bills sponsors 
have sat through a 1st grade SEL class? I have - both as a parent volunteer and a 
substitute teacher. Guess what they learn? How to be a good friend. How to stand up 
to bullies. How to seek help from a grown up when something doesn't feel safe. How 
to be accepting of people who are different AND the same as them. How to regulate 
their behavior as to not become disruptive in class. How to communicate.
How do we expect our students to learn to be world citizens, compassionate 
neighbors, and productive members of society if we are not helping them understand 
similarities and differences?
Eliminating SEL/DEI curricula does not magically turn our students into robots who 
are only in schools to learn core academic subject areas. They are still friends. They 
are still siblings. They are still classmates and teammates. Our schools are the bedrock
of a productive society and we SHOULD be preparing them in social ways and 
academic ways.
I simply cannot overstate how much my family opposes this bill.
