LD 618
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee: 
My name is Michelle Littlefield, and I am a resident of Gorham, Maine. As a former 
higher education administrator, I am writing to strongly oppose LD 618: “An Act to 
Eliminate Critical Race Theory, Social and Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion from School Curricula.”
LD 618 is an attempt to not only redefine critical race theory; social and emotional 
learning; and diversity, equity and inclusion, but also to eliminate it from our schools. 
This is a slippery slope and huge government overreach. In my former role at a local 
university, I worked with Master of Education and Doctorate of Education programs. 
Our educators are trained to stay updated on the latest quantitative and qualitative 
research in their field. I know that our educators are the best suited to make 
curriculum choices. Our government officials are not.
As a parent, I am appalled by these continued attacks on our public schools. My 
elementary-aged children have benefited significantly from social emotional learning 
frameworks. I know that they will be better humans because they will have the ability 
to be exposed to people, ideas, religions and ways of life different from what they see 
between the four walls of our home. Do not take this away from our family.
This bill is nothing more than another attempt by groups of extremists to demean 
Maine educators. Do not pass LD 618.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Michelle Littlefield
Gorham, Maine
