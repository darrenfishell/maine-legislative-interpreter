LD 618
I am strongly opposed to LD 618, An Act to Eliminate Critical Race Theory, Social 
and Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion from School Curricula. 
This bill actively harms our children and has no place in a free democratic society. 
Forced compliance with, or sole exposure to, a narrow, white-centered world view 
does not serve Maine or the United States of America. Our children need the skills to 
understand their own emotions, a broad range of cultural practices, and the reality that
not everyone is "like them". Please vote AGAINST LD 618.
