Dear Committee Members:
Critical Race Theory, Social and Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion should not be taught to young children and young adults. These ideas were 
originally taught in College. These ideas should remain in college or not even be 
taught at all.  This thinking leads to hate amongst the races.  
Our Country was founded on Equal Rights for All, and this idea should be taught in 
schools.  Children are born without prejudices. Why do we need to show them 
prejudice?
I ask that you vote OUGHT to PASS.  Thank you
