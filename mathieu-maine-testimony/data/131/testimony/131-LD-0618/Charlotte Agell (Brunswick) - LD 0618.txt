CRT is nothing but teaching HISTORY, as in allowing us to examine today's reality 
and how we got here. It has nothing to do with shaming anybody. Social Emotional 
Learning and Diversity work is not dangerous. Maine is becoming more diverse. We 
should celebrate all races, religions, gender expression, sexual identities. Children 
have inquiring minds. Banning CRT and SEL (etc) work does nobody any favors. 
Children are LEARNERS and have a right to know. Prohibiting schools from 
including this sort of important work in curricula is a terrible idea. Children have open
minds. Let's not work to close them. Many thanks from a recently retired lifelong 
public school teacher.
