LD 618
I am writing to oppose the passing of LD 618, “An Act to Eliminate Critical Race 
Theory, Social and Emotional Learning, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion from 
School Curricula.”  This bill would have a negative impact on the most vulnerable 
members of our population.  
This bill prohibits CRT, SEL, and DEI in its first sentence.  It then defines these terms
with seven criteria.  At no point in my life have I been in a DEI meeting, read a CRT- 
or SEL-informed text, or spoken to a DEI officer on any campus and encountered 
anything like the criteria listed.  The criteria are completely disconnected from CRT, 
SEL, and DEI as I have experienced them.  Unfortunately, that complete disconnect 
will not keep the bill from having a negative impact on schools.  School 
administrators, wary of having something construed as meeting these criteria in some 
way, could cancel curricular initiatives designed to help various groups of people 
within our state, and thus negatively impact the most vulnerable members of our 
population as a result.
Things like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives can provide major benefits to 
public schools and public school students.  We live in a world that is saturated in 
inequality, and we owe it to one another to figure out how to make the world a little 
more kind, a bit more fair.  These sorts of initiatives within a curriculum can help 
people take on that work, and set themselves to making the kind of world they want to
live in.  For these reasons, LD 618 ought not to pass.
