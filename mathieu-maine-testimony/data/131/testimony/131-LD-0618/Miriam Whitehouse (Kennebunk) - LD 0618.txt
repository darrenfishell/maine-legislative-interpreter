I am strongly opposed to LD 618, An Act to Eliminate Critical Race 
Theory, Social and Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion from School Curricula. 
This country is known as a melting pot, as since its inception, people 
from all over the world, representing many different cultures and 
ethnic backgrounds have come here to make a better life.  I find this 
orientation of “us” vs “them” to be about as un-American as you can 
get, frankly, and I believe it’s based on fear, prejudice, and often 
racism.   It’s time we opened our hearts to those who may differ from 
us, and recognize that diversity makes us thrive.      Please vote 
AGAINST LD 618
