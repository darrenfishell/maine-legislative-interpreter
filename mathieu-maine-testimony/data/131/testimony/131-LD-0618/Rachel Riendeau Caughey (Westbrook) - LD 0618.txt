LD 618
My name is Rachel Riendeau Caughey, a resident of Westbrook in Cumberland 
County, and I’m writing to testify against LD 618: An Act to Eliminate Educational 
Critical Race Theory, Social and Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion from School Curricula. As an active member of One Westbrook, a graduate 
of public elementary schools,  a sociocultural anthropologist, a mental health services 
researcher for over 7 years, and an expectant parent hoping to use Maine public 
schools, I believe strongly in more education and consciousness raising about the 
differences, especially racial ones, that implicitly have shaped, and continue to shape, 
our communities, beliefs, and practices. For example, when I was in sixth grade 
public school, a brown-skinned Cambodian boy named Chattra in my predominantly 
white class was teased mercilessly for his appearance, with ripped clothes, ashy 
elbows, big lips, and an accent. Our teacher never intervened. I am pained to this day 
I didn’t stand up for him, and only found out in college that his family had fled from 
genocide, the Khmer Rouge, resulting in new poverty in the US. I learned too late that
the teasing was rooted in fear of difference, in a lack of guidance in how to process 
these feelings, in colorism and white supremacy that devalues people who are darker 
in skin tone, and in ignorance unknowingly passed down from parents, teachers, and 
school staff. Chattra’s trauma from such incidents and my smaller, persistent guilt 
pales in comparison to the discomfort of learning about the role white people who 
looked like me play in this kind of social wrongdoing. This harm will only repeat here
and now without access to educational guidance, especially with the influx of 
non-European immigrants to Maine. To include, protect, and allow growth in all our 
students and their families– not just white people or those with access to private 
pediatric mental/emotional/behavioral care and supplementary, resources for learning 
about emotions and the range of human difference– I urge legislators to strongly 
oppose and fight to stop LD 618: An Act to Eliminate Educational Critical Race 
Theory, Social and Emotional Learning and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion from 
School Curricula.
