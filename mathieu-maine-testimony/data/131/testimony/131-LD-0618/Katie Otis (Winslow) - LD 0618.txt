I am writing this testimony in an effort to help raise awareness about the risks that 
eliminating critical race theory, social and emotional awareness as well as diversity, 
equity ans inclusion present to our society, both currently and in the future.
As an HR professional and someone who has managed, led and supported adults in 
the state of Maine for almost 20 years I can tell you with absolute certainty that these 
crucial skills are missing in a large population of adults in our state.  This lack of 
skills presents problems in personal as well as professional relationships, as there is a 
lack of awareness of that can lead to poor communication, damaged relationships and 
in it's worst form racism or homophobia. If these adults had been given structured 
amd consistent education as children on emotional intelligence, acceptance of 
opinions different from their own, as well as tools to navigate conflict in a healthy and
productive way it would have resulted in a better outcome not only for these adults, 
who now struggle to manage relationships, careers, their behavior on social media but
most importantly how they teach their children to show up in the world.
Now is a pivotal time for our state. Do we choose to take away these powerful tools 
from our educators or do we instead demand more education for our children, not 
optional education but required education so that the next generation can move 
through problems in a more effective way.
