My name is Eden Saylor I am 16 years old and my voice needs to be heard. This act 
directly affects me and my peers and such an abrasive act will not be tolerated. We 
have the right to be taught about race, gender identity, institutional racism and so 
forth. These conversations are necessary for our growth and development as 
functioning members of society. A claim I hear a lot is that this "agenda" is being 
shoved down our throats and used to brainwash us. This is fear mongering created to 
defend the attacks on our educational freedom. Do not restrict our education.  Its time 
to progress as a society and hear the voices of the new generation. Thank you for your
time.
