This bill is overreaching in it's broad and vague language. Schools are already doing a
good job of managing curriculum at the local level, where local parents and citizens 
have the opportunity to be involved and engaged in decision-making.
Teachers and guidance counselors should be trusted to use their education, expertise, 
and good judgment in meeting the needs of students and the educational requirements 
of the state. This legislation is unnecessary and sends a harmful message to 
marginalized groups. I can forsee how it would also open school districts up to 
discrimination based litigation that would be unnecessarily costly and distracting for 
school districts.
