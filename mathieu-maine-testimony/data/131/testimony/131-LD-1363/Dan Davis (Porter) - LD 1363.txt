LD 1363
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the ENR Committee:
I represent no entity or agency and would like to express opposition to LD1363.
The State moving from 3 acres of open pit mining to 100 acres of open pit mining 
doesn't seem to meet the competent and reasonable sniff-test. 
I'd like some more thought to be put into the long term impacts of this radical 
departure from tested and codified law.
I urge the committee to vote ought not to pass on LD1363.
Thank you.
Dan
