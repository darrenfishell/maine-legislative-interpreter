My
name
is
Jan

I
am
a
resident
of
Rockland
and

Earthworks.
Earthworks
is
a
national
non-profit
organization
dedicated
to
protecting
communities
and
the
environment
from
the
destructive
impacts
of
mineral
and
energy
development,
while
seeking
sustainable
solutions.
We
work
closely
with
a
broad
coalition
of
governments,
Native
Americans,
community
groups
and
other
conservation
organizations
to
improve
policies
governing
hardrock
mining,
oil,
and
gas
development
in
the
U.S.
and
abroad.
The
planet
is
in
the
midst
of
an
existential
climate
crisis,
and
we
must
accelerate
the
transition
to
renewable
energy.
Energy
transition
minerals,
like
lithium,
currently
play
an
important
role
composing
electric
vehicle
batteries
and
other
technologies.
Responsibly
sourcing
these
minerals
means
clean
energy
can
truly
be
clean.
However,
securing
our
mineral
supply
does
not
require
weakening
our
environmental
laws.

Metals
mining
is
the
leading
industrial
polluter
in
the
United
States,
and
contributes
10%
of
energy-related
greenhouse
gas
emissions
worldwide.
It's
also
among
the
1
least
regulated.
In
the
West,
where
metal
mining
is
common,
perpetual
sulfuric
acid
drainage
has
polluted
the
headwaters
of
40%
of
the

Spodumene
lithium
deposits
could
pose
a
higher
risk
of
generating
acids
than
typical
non-metallic
mines
for
sand,
quartz,
or
quarry
minerals.
For
this
reason,
Maine
should
proceed
with
caution
before
changing
environmental
regulations.
Data
shows
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
predict
the
exact
impacts
of
mining
operations
before
they
begin.
Moreover,
the
predictions
made
by
mining
plans
are
frequently
wrong.
In
an
unprecedented
2005
peer-reviewed
research
paper
commissioned
by
Earthworks,
conducted
by
a
member
of
the
National
Academies
of
Science
Earth
Science
Board,
mining
industry
promises
of
environmental
performance
were
compared
against
what
actually
happened
at
the
mines.
While
100%
of
mines
in
the
study
predicted
environmental
compliance;
75%
failed.

Globally,
there
is
very
little
data
and
independent
review
of
the
particular
impacts
of
spodumene
lithium
mining,
the
majority
of
which
occurs
currently
in
Western
Australia.
Before
changing
the
regulations
that
protect
local
communities,
we
need
more
information.
We
need
look
no
further
than
the
Callahan
Superfund
Site
in
Brooksville
to
understand
the
disastrous
impacts
metallic
mining
can
have.
To
counteract
these
impacts,
Maine
has
already
put
in
place
some
of
the
most
protective
mining
regulations
in
the
country
for
water,
air,
the
industries
that
depend
on
natural
resources,
as
well
as
for
taxpayers–with
our
bonding
and
insurance
requirements.

Mining
should
be
balanced
with
other
nearby
land
uses,
which
often
generate
longer
lasting,
sustainable
economic
activity.
For
instance,
the
outdoor
economy
in
Maine—
defined
by
bike,
snow,
trail
and
water
sports
as
well
as
camping,
fishing,
hunting,
motorcycling,
off-roading
and
wildlife
viewing
—
makes
up
3.6%
of
Maine’s
economy,
supports
more
than
30,000
jobs
and
pays
$1.2
billion
in
in
compensation,
accounting
for
2.8%
of
the
state’s
wages.
The
value
of
hunting,
fishing,
4
recreation,
sacred
sites,
pristine
landscapes
and
clean
water
often
outweighs
that
of
the
minerals.

New
mines
are
not
the
only
sources
of
the
metals
needed
for
electric
vehicles
or
other
energy
transition
technologies.
Before
looking
to
open
new
mines,
we
should
prioritize
the
alternatives
that
are
already
available
for
mineral
sourcing,
like
realizing
the
full
potential
of
recycling,
reuse,
take-back
(producer
responsibility)
programs,
and
other
ways
of
reclaiming
minerals
from
products
that
have
reached
the
end
of
their
useful
lives.
According
to
research
by
the
University
of
Sydney's
Institute
for
Sustainable
Futures,
effectively
recycling
end-of-life
batteries
could
reduce
global
EV
mineral
demand
55%
for
newly
mined
copper,
25%
for
lithium
and
35%
for
cobalt
and
nickel
by
2040.
If
we
set
the
right
incentive
structures,
5
we
can
significantly
reduce
the
demand
for
new
mining.

New
research
out
of
UC
Davis
found
that
the
US
can
achieve
zero
emissions
transportation
and
reduce
demand
for
lithium
up
to
92%
by
2050
by
improving
transit,
battery
design,
reuse
and
recycling.
In
Maine,
buses
make
up
less
than
1%
of
annual
vehicle
travel.
We
have
the
opportunity
6

to
make
significant
changes
to
reduce
the
demand
for
lithium,
and
therefore
the
demand
for
new
mines,
if
we
invest
in
better
electric
vehicle
transit
options.
Rolling
back
Maine's
regulations
would
undermine
the
state's
efforts
to
protect
clean
water
and
the
communities
and
businesses
that
rely
on
it.
I
t
is
essential
the
Maine
Legislature
continue
to
ensure
stringent
safeguards
are
in
place
for
metallic
mining
and
consider
and
promote
all
policy
options
that
reduce
the
need
for
new
primary
raw
materials
extraction.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
