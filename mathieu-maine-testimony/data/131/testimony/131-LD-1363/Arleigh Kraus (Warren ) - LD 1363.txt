In Opposition to LD 1363 An Act to Support Extraction of Common Minerals by 
Amending the Maine Metallic Minerals Act 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and the Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources my name is Arleigh Kraus I am a registered cannabis caregiver 
with a B.S. in biochemistry, an organic farmer, and business owner in Warren. I am a 
board member of Maine based Citizens against Residential Mining Activities 
(CARMA) and a concerned citizen scientist.
I am testifying today in opposition to LD 1363 for several reasons.
Firstly, the push to make open pit mining of spodumene legal without factoring in 
health and environmental impacts without rigorous scientific analysis is gross 
negligence.  
The blind rush for existing lithium deposits to be extracted for use in batteries and 
electrical components lacks foresight.  Technology is evolving at a rapid pace and 
lithium may not even be the metal required for batteries in the near future. For 
example, in the past 10 years lightbulb technology has evolved from halogen to 
compact fluorescent bulbs to light emitting diodes (LED) all in a very short span of 
time.  The metals used in lightbulbs has rapidly changed in a minor span of time. Why
are we rushing to extract a metal from the land which has devastating lasting 
consequences for the environment.  This is not NIMBYism.  This is common sense 
questioning.  Lasting consequences does not mean a decade of toxic waste, it means 
thousands of years of contaminated land and water.
I urge you to vote ought not to pass. 
Respectfully, Arleigh A. Kraus
