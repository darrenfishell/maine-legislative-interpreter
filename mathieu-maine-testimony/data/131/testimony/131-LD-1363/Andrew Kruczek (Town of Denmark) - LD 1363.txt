I strongly against this proposed legislation as it allows (see lines 37 and 38 below) 
violation of water quality standards for sedimentation and turbidity--standards should 
not be randomly enforced--all business activities should be required to comply with 
them.

Sec. 5. 38 MRSA §490-OO, sub-§4, ¶O, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 142, §8, is
33 amended to read:
34 O. The mining operation will not use open-pit mining, except that the mining 
operation
35 may use open-pit mining if the mining operation will only generate mine waste 
that
36 does not have the potential to create acid rock drainage, alkali rock drainage or 
metal
37 mine drainage, or does not violate water quality standards other than sedimentation
and
38 turbidity.
