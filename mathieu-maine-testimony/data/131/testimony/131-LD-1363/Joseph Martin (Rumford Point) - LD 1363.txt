Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Today, l will be discussing the merits of mining pegmatites for 
lithium in Maine. Maine has some of the largest pegmatite 
deposits in the USA, containing high concentrations of 
lithium—bearing minerals such as spodumene, lepidolite, and 
petalite. Mining pegmatites for lithium in Maine could have 
significant environmental benefits, particularly in the context of 
the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and promote 
sustainable energy sources. 
lt's important to consider the impact of sourcing lithium from 
other countries. Over 40,000 children are reportedly enslaved 
by a Chinese company "Dongfang Mining (CDM)" in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to mine cobalt, a key 
component of lithium batteries. Additionally, there are concerns 
about the use of slave labor from the Uyghurs in China to mine 
other minerals used in lithium batteries. This has led to the term 
"Blood Batteries" being used to describe lithium batteries made 
using such unethical practices and being sold to all of us here in 
the USA. 
By mining pegmatites for lithium in Maine, the US could reduce 
its reliance on imported lithium that makes these "Blood 
Batteries." This could help reduce the carbon footprint
associated with transportation and logistics, as well as the 
environmental and ethical impact of mining in other countries. 
Mining pegmatites for lithium in Maine is also considered to be 
a more environmentally friendly option than other mining 
methods in other types of formations. Pegmatites are typically 
found in hard rock formations, which means there is no need 
for any large open—pit mining. This reduces the amount of 
waste rock that needs to be excavated and the impact on the 
surrounding environment. Furthermore, mining pegmatites for 
lithium in Maine is less energy—intensive than mining other 
minerals such as copper, iron, silver, lead, and gold mines of 
old. 
Despite these potential benefits, there have been calls to ban or 
restrict mining in l\/laine, citing concerns about the potential 
environmental impact. While it is important to protect the 
environment, copying laws from other states without 
considering the specific circumstances in Maine could have 
unintended negative consequences, such as lost economic 
opportunities and increased reliance on foreign sources of 
lithium. 
It's important to note that the lithium ore mined in Maine will 
be processed out of state, which means that the environmental 
impact of processing the ore is not directly related to mining in 
Maine. Therefore, mining pegmatites for lithium in Maine can 
be seen as a responsible and sustainable option, as it produces 
a valuable resource without any environmental harm to the 
local area. 
Additionally, the waste rock generated by lithium mining in 
Maine can be repurposed for other applications such as 
crushed stone for roads, rail, and construction projects. This
means that the waste rock from lithium mining can be used to 
support the infrastructure needs of the state, making it a more 
sustainable option than simply disposing of the waste rock. 
It's important to keep in mind the issue of "blood batteries" 
mentioned earlier. While mining pegmatites in Maine can 
provide a domestically sourced and more sustainable option for 
lithium production, it's important to also consider the global 
supply chain and the potential human rights abuses involved in 
the mining of other minerals used in battery production. lt's 
important for companies to have ethical and responsible supply 
chain practices to ensure that they are not contributing to these 
issues. 
ln conclusion, mining pegmatites for lithium in Maine can 
provide significant environmental benefits and support the 
transition to cleaner energy sources. The waste rock generated 
by mining can also be repurposed for other applications, 
making it a more sustainable option. However, it‘s important to 
also consider the larger global supply chain and ensure that 
companies have ethical and responsible practices to avoid 
contributing to human rights abuses. Thank you for listening.
