RE:
LD
1363,
An
Act
to
Support
Extraction
of
Common
Minerals
by
Amending
the
Maine
Metallic
Mineral
Mining
Act
Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1363,
An
Act
to
Support
Extraction
of
Common
Minerals
by
Amending
the
Maine
Metallic
Mineral
Mining
Act,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members
and
supporters.
Climate
change
is
the
leading
threat
to
Maine’ s
wildlife
and
habitat,
the
conservation
of
which
is
central
to
Maine
Audubon’ s
mission.
T o
avoid
the
worst
impacts
of
climate
change,
Maine
must
(and
is)
embrace
beneficial
electrification,
i.e.,
replace
direct
fossil
fuel
use
with
electricity
in
a
manner
that
reduces
emissions.
This
necessary
transition
is
rife
with
complexity ,
often
pitting
–
to
the
uninitiated
–
climate
and
clean
ener gy
goals
with
natural
resource
conservation
goals.
Locating
grid-scale
solar
and
wind
ener gy
projects,
for
example,
which
are
essential
to
this
transition,
presents
land
use
challenges
when
those
projects
are
located
on
important
natural
resources.
However ,
balancing
natural
resource
impacts
with
a
project’ s
climate
benefits
is
possible
and
has
been
an
or ganizational
priority
for
Maine
Audubon
for
many
years.
1
Maine
must
strive
for
a
similar
balance
should
it
pursue
mining
of
materials
that
are
critical
components
of
the
technology
–
such
as
batteries
that
power
electric
vehicles
–
that
is,
indeed,
critical
to
beneficial
electrification.
Maine
Audubon
believes
that
LD
1363,
with
several
friendly
amendments,
is
a
good
step
toward
achieving
that
balance.
Presently ,
Maine’ s
Metallic
Mineral
Mining
Act
restricts
open
pit
mining,
which
may
be
necessary
to
mine
lithium
in
Maine.
LD
1363
would
allow
the
restriction
on
open
pit
mining
to
be
lifted
if
a
proposed
mining
operation
will
only
generate
mine
waste
that
does
not
have
the
potential
to
create
acid
mine
drainage
–
a
leading,
negative
mining
impact.
Furthermore,
this
approach
keeps
intact
all
of
the
other
safeguards
in
the
Mining
Act
that
protect
Maine’ s
natural

resources
from
the
multitude
of
risks
posed
by
mining
activities,
including:
(1)
A
prohibition
on
tailings
impoundments;
(2)
a
ban
on
mines
requiring
perpetual
treatment;
(3)
a
requirement
not
to
contaminate
groundwater
beyond
100
feet
from
a
mining
operation;
and
(4)
a
requirement
to
demonstrate
suf ficient
funding
to
cover
a
worst-case
mining
disaster .
Our
colleagues
at
the
Natural
Resources
Council
of
Maine
have
presented
to
the
Committee
and
submitted
in
writing
amendments
that
would
improve
LD
1363.
Maine
Audubon
supports
those
proposed,
reasonable
amendments
because
they
are
in
furtherance
of
our
intention
to
support
mining
only
if
there
are
assurances
that
any
natural
resource
impacts
would
be
minimal.
That
said,
we
ur ge
the
Committee
to
proceed
with
caution.
While,
on
principle,
we
feel
strongly
that
the
interests
at
play
can
be
balanced,
a
lot
remains
unknown
about
the
ore
deposits
that
have
spurred
public
interest
in
Maine
and
this
legislation.
For
example,
while
we
know
that
spodumene
itself
is
not
an
acid-generating
ore,
we
do
not
know
if
the
deposits
in
Maine
co-occur
with
deposits
of
reactive,
acid-generating
ores
or
materials
that
are
otherwise
dangerous.
Exposing
acid-generating
ores
would
be
deleterious
to
Maine
waters.
This
legislation,
if
passed,
should
be
but
one
tool
of
many
used
to
strike
a
careful
balance
between
extracting
minerals
that
are
vital
to
our
renewable
ener gy
transition
and
protecting
our
natural
resources.
W e
must
proceed
with
caution.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
our
comments.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
