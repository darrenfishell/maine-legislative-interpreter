TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT 
AND NATURAL RESOURCES  
IN SUPPORT OF LD 1363  
An Act to Support Extraction of Common Minerals by Amending the Maine Metallic Mineral 
Mining Act  
 
April 13, 2023  
 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Natural Resources, my name is Stephen Dickson, and I am the State Geologist and Director of 
the Maine Geological Survey. I am speaking on behalf of the Department of A griculture, 
Conservation and Forestry (DACF) in favor of LD 1363, An Act to Support Extraction of 
Common Minerals by Amending the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act.  
 
This bill sets regulatory guidance according to the potential environmental impact of mini ng 
different rock types. It also takes a science -based approach that considers the geologic 
differences among many types of mineral deposits in Maine rocks.  
 
This amendment would allow surface excavation of rocks of granitic composition but only if 
water q uality standards are met. The environmental impact of this type of excavation is similar to 
the impacts of quarries, which are allowed under separate rules. This bill will more properly 
align the regulation of granitic rock excavation with that of other qu arried stone. This bill will 
continue the existing prohibition against mining rocks that would lead to acidic drainage with 
environmental impacts.  
 
This bill also allows the quarrying of limestone for cement manufacturing to continue by 
correcting the existing statutory definition.  
 
The Department supports the amendments to the Maine Mineral Mining Act proposed in LD 
1363. I would be happy to answer any questions now or at the work session.
