Parks and Lands to Enter into Certain LeasesI 
_ April 26, 2023 
Senator Ingwerson, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry. I am Senator Russell Black, and I am here today to 
present LDl659, Resolve, Authorizing the Department of A griculture, Conservation and 
Forestry, Bureau of Parks and Lands to Enter into Certain Leases. 
This resolve authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to lease certain state park land and public reserved lands. 
You will hear from the department on where and what these leases are. 
I Want to make it clear that none of these projects are new projects, they are existing projects that 
have been in place for many years and require legislative review because of the law change in 
2021 When it comes to leases. 
Thank you for your attention to this legislation.
