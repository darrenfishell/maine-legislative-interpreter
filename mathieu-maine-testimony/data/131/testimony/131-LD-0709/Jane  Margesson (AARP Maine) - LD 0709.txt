AARP Maine Testimony in favor of LD 709 : "An Act to Support Home Share 
Programming for Seniors"  
 
Greetings Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer and honorable members of the Joint 
Committee on Health and Human Services . My name is  Jane Margesson  and I am from the 
town of  Windham . Today, on behalf of AARP ’s 200,000 Maine members , I am testifying in 
favor of  LD 709 which will create  a Home  Share Progr am for older adults . 
 
AARP is the nation’s largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering 
people 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. Right here in Maine , we work to 
strengthen communities and advocate for what matters most  to families: health security, 
financial stability,  and personal fulfillment.  On behalf of our nearly 200,00 0 members , 
thank you for the opportunity to testify today.  
 
For nearly 60 years, AARP has been fighting for older adults to be able to age in place. Y et 
with increase s in housing -related costs, for many older adults this is becoming next to 
impossible. Housing costs , such as heating and cooling one’s home, go up  each year and 
Mainers , specifically those who are on a fixed income , cannot keep up.  
 
It is expected that by 2038, more than 50 million households will be 65 and older, and 
many will struggle to remain in their homes as they age1. Home Sharing provides the 
opportunity for individuals to remain in their homes comfortably and affordably , or in the 
communities of their choosing.   
 
Not only does a HomeShare program enable  individuals to better afford the cost  of living in 
their homes, it also creates an opportunity for individuals to share household chores, 
create an increased sense of safety and even esta blish a sense of companionship.  
 
The Vermont HomeShare Program has been matching individuals with roommates for over 
40 years. Through a thorough screening process, which includes background checks and 
interviews, the Vermont HomeShare Program has been ab le to successfully match 197

participants in 2022 alone. This resulted in an estimated $450,000 saved in rental expenses 
for the HomeShare guests this past year2.    
 
Most Mainers  want to remain in their homes and communities. AARP’s 2021 “ Home and 
Community Preferences Survey ” reports that 77% of adults age d 50 and older want to 
remain in their homes as they age. 3  LD 709 offers a program that will increase the supply 
of affordable housing  immediately  while suppo rting the needs of older residents, aged 50 
and older, who may benefit from another person living in their home.  
 
We are all aware that we are experiencing a housing crisis now and that we need to act 
soon. W e need to look  at innovative and sustainable solutions that can be implemented 
sooner than later.  AARP Maine  asks that you support LD 709.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
