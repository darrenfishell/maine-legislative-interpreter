Presenting L.D. 1637, An Act to Prohibit the Revocation ofa 
Professional or Occupational License for Lapsed 
Child Support Payments 
Before the Judiciary Committee 
Tuesday, May 2, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen, and members of the J o1nt Stand1ng 
Commlttee on Jud1c1ary I am Senator Errc Brakey, representmg the people of 
Auburn, New Gloucester, Poland, and Durham 1 am before you today to present 
L D. 1637, An Act to Prohzbzt the Revocatzon of a Professzonal or Occupatzonal 
Lzcensefor Lapsed Chzld Support Payments 
I am bnngmg th1s proposal forward at the request of a constrtuent, but 1t 1s an 1dea 
that makes a lot of sense to me 
There should be str1ctpena1t1es for a parent’s fallure to pay chlld support At the 
same trme, those pena1t1es should make sense To pay ch1ld support, an 1nd1v1dual 
must have a source of rncome How can We expect an rndrvrdual to pay chrld 
support 1f we revoke thelr llcense to do therr Job‘? 
Th1s b1ll1s pretty stralght forward It would proh1b1t the 1'6VOC8.'E101'1 ofa 
professlonal or occupatronal l1cense by the Department of Inland F1sher1es and 
W1ld11fe for lapsed ch1ld support payments 
Accordmg to Legal Zoom, consequences for fallure to pay ch1ld support may 
mclude many thrngs 
O Warrant lssued for arrest, whrch may be crrmlnal or c1v11 
0 Fmdlng of contempt of court 
0 Fmes, ]a1l, or both 
0 Garnrshment of wages, mcludlng unemployment and Worker's compensatlon
0 Demal of tax refunds 
0 EXCl1lSl01'1 from rece1pt of certaln government beneﬁts 
0 Revocat1on of passport 
O Suspensron, revocatron, or denral of vanous 11censes —profess1onal, dr1ver's, 
huntrng/ ﬁshmg/boatmg 
O Havlng a hen placed on the property to cover payment 
There appear to be many legal meehanlsms to compel payment of ch1ld support 
that do not suspend a person’s means to pay chlld support 
Thank you all for your t1me and consrderatron on th1s matter I would be happy to 
take quest1ons to the best of my ab1l1ty
