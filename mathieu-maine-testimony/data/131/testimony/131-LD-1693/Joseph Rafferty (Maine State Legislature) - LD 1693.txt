Testimony of Senator Joe Raﬂerty Presenting 
LD 1693, An Act to Amend Kennebunk Sewer District Charter 
Before the Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Wednesday, April 26, 2023 
Good morning Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Select Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology. My name is Joe Rafferty and I proudly 
represent the people of Senate District 34 including Berwick, North B€1‘WiCl(, Wells, Kemiebunk and 
Kennebunkport. 
I am here today to present LD 1693, “An Act to Amend Kennebunk Sewer District Charter. ” This bill 
amends the charter of the Kennebunk Sewer District to update the description of the district ’s territorial 
limits.' 
At the request of the District, I am happy to do so although I can’t claim that I understand the exact 
boundary descriptions as laid out in this legislation. I will do my best to answer questions but know 
that there are others in the room more qualiﬁed to do so and hope that you reserve your more technical 
questions for them. 
I do have full faith in the district, its management and service provided to the people of Kennebunk. I 
urge your support for LD 1693. 
Thank you!
