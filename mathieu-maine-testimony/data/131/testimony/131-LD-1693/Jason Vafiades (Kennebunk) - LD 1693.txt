RE:  Testimony in Support of LD 1693 – An Act to Amend the Kennebunk Sewer District 
Charter 
 
Dear Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and other distinguished members of the Committee 
on Energy, Utilities and Technology, 
I am writing in support of your recommendation of “ought to pass” for LD 1693 – An Act to Amend 
the Kennebunk Sewer District. 
As an owner of a site civil engineering company and a landowner in Kennebunk (which would fall 
under the extended charter boundaries as defined in this legislation), I fully support this legislation 
that extends the reach and service of the Kennebunk Sewer District. 
The proposed project expansion boundaries would dovetail nicely with the Town of Kennebunk’s 
2022Comprehensive Plan update, as well as recent legislation (former LD 2003) that attempts to 
jumpstart expanded development opportunities for more affordable housing options in the State of 
Maine. 
Passing Legislation such as LD 1693 allows for a number of positive outcomes within the community 
of Kennebunk such as: 
 The removal of septic systems and pollutant loading into the soils and watershed 
 More opportunities for affordable housing developments with higher density where public 
sewer is available 
 Increased membership within the district, allowing for capital improvement and 
maintenance fees to be supported by a broader economic base of paying customers 
I would be happy to expand on my opinion of “ought to pass” as part of your Workshop Session.  As a 
design professional who specializes in the expansion of public utilities, I can heartily attest to the fact 
that the future of Maine depends on its continued pursuit and dedication to public infrastructure 
investment, which includes the expansion of public utilities. 
Thank you for your time and dedication to public service through your work on this Committee and 
in the State House. 
Regards,
