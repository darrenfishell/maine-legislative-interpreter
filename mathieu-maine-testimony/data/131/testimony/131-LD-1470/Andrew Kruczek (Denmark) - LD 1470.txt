The bill requires a deed (after property transfer) to be labelled "Protected Land" if the 
property is zoned "resource protection" at the time of transfer.  What happens in the 
future transfer(s) of same property if the property is no longer zoned "resource 
protection" at the time of transfer--can the land owner remove the "protected land" 
label from deed?  Can this be done as written currently in the bill or should language 
be added to the bill to allow this?
