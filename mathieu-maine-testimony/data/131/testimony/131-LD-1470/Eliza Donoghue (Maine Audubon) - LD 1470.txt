RE: LD 1470, An Act Regarding Transfers of Land in Resource Protection Areas  
 
Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Members of the Committee:  
 
 Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony “neither for, nor against” LD 1470, An Act 
Regarding Transfers of Land in Resource Protection Areas, on behalf of Maine Audubon  and our 30,000 
members, supporters, and volunteers.  
 
Maine Audubon believes that awareness of the natural resource values on a piece of property will result 
in better outcomes for the landowner, as well as the natural resource or resources. LD 1470 would  increase such 
awareness by requiring that land designated as resource protection land be marked as "Protected Land" on the 
deed when the land is transferred. This strategy has merit, however, we want to draw the Committee’s attention 
to potential pitfalls  as they consider this bill:  
 
● The nature or extent of the resource that the plan or ordinance seeks to protect may change over 
time. Coastal sand dunes, wetlands, and various wildlife habitats, for example, regularly change 
as a result of changing weather patterns, climate, and more. Comprehensive plans, zoning 
ordinances, or zoning maps may not be modified to reflect those changes.  
 
● Comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, or zoning maps may be modified after a deed transfer.  
 
● “Protected Land” might be misc onstrued to mean that the land may not be developed or 
otherwise built upon. Many of the resources that comprehensive plans, etc. seek to protect can be 
developed in consultation with Maine’s natural resource agencies.  
 
 I regret that I cannot attend the p ublic hearing for this bill. I welcome the opportunity to otherwise 
engage with the Committee and bill stakeholders.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Eliza Donoghue, Esq.  
Director of Advocacy
