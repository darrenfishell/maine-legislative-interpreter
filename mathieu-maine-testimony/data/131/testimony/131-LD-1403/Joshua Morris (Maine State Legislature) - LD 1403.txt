Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, distinguished members of the Labor and 
Housing Committee, my name is Joshua Morris. I have the honor of representing the 
citizens of Leeds, Wayne, and Turner. I apologize for not being there in person today.I 
have asked Representative Bradstreet to present this testimony in my place. 
Maine has one of the highest minimum wages in the country. This bill is about 
establishing uniformity and predictability for our businesses. Those businesses ina 
municipality that have a higher minimum Wage have to charge higher prices to their 
customers than those in neighboring connnunities that have the state minimum wage. 
This puts them at a competitive disadvantage with their competition in the next town 
over. 
It is also a good idea that labor laws should be as uniform throughout our state as 
possible. When the 129*“ legislature passed the paid time off law, one of the provisions 
we established was pre-emption. 
I thank the committee for its consideration and apologize that I can’t be there 
today to answer questions but hope to be available for the work session. 
District 91 Leeds, Turner & Wayne
