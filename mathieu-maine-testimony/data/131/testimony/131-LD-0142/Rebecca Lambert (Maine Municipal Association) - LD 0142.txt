Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association
Neither For nor Against
LD 142 – An Act to Fund Climate-related Service Work
and
LD 143 - An Act to Support Rural Service Programming and Promote Volunteerism
January 31, 2023
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational and Cultural 
Affairs Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, and I am providing testimony neither for nor 
against LD 142 and LD 143 on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association’s 70-member 
Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). 
The Maine Climate Corps and Maine Service Fellows unite two important aspects of our 
future—youth engagement and climate change mitigation. These two programs will engage 
young professionals and community members in meaningful projects with the intent of 
advancing priorities that include protecting the environment at the local level through community 
service and volunteerism. Municipalities are supportive of state efforts to assist rural areas, 
especially when they are tasked with providing needed services to their residents in addition to 
projects for the benefit of future generations. 
Regardless of the magnitude of success, any step forward is progress, and this bill 
provides assistance to foster that outcome instead of building barriers. The LPC is neither for nor 
against LD 142 and LD 143 on the basis that engaging young people today will spur more 
interest in finding solutions to environmental issues among the future generation of activists, 
policymakers, and community leaders, but with the knowledge that not all municipalities possess 
a rural designation and can benefit from this assistance.
Thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.
