Testimony in support of LD 142, An Act to Fund Climate-Related Service Work
To: Sen. Joseph Rafferty, Representative Michael Brennan, and Members of the Committee 
On Education and Cultural Affairs, Maine House of Representatives 
From: Halsey W. Snow, Ph.D., Casco, Maine
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Committee on Education
and Cultural Affairs:
I am an independent educator and small business owner, on the brink of retirement. 
I am writing to testify in support of LD 142.  There is no doubt in my mind that we are in the 
midst of the most challenging crisis of our lifetimes.  The climate-related disasters here in the 
US and around the world are evidence enough that we must do ALL WE CAN DO – NOW – 
to alleviate the worst of what is happening and what will come, and begin to create our lives 
more in harmony with the Earth's bio-systems, on which we rely for our very existence.  And 
that means some pretty courageous out-of-the-box thinking and action, in every way 
imaginable. If we fail to act now, we have only ourselves to  blame for what we bring upon all 
of us. What will be funded and created through this legislation is a part of this long-term 
change we are seeking. Please give it your utmost support.
Thank you for reading my testimony.
