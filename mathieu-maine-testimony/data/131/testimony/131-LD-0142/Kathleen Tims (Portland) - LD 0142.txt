Testimony in support of LD 142, An Act to Fund Climate-related Service Work
To: Sen. Joseph Rafferty, Representative Michael Brennan, and Members of the 
Committee On Education and Cultural Affairs From: Kathleen Tims, Portland ME
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Kathleen Tims and I live in Portland, ME.
I am writing to testify in support of LD 142.
We desperately need more positions in the economy that can guide and support the 
transition to a clean-energy, sustainable future. Without individuals fighting for 
Maine's people and environment and building the climate programs that our policy 
outlines, we will not become a future leader economically or socially. Please support 
a program that makes our sustainable future possible.
Thank you for reading my testimony.
