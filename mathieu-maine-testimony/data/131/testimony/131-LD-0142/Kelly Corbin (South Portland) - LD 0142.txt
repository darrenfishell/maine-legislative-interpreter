I strongly support funding for Maine's Climate Corps as a response to the urgent 
threat of climate change. We need boots on the ground support for reducing our 
carbon footprint and the Corps provides just that--a trained workforce dedicated to 
helping people save energy (and money). The Corps will provide participants with job
training and livable wages as a way to support their careers. The program will support
communities across the state as they become part of the just transition to cleaner, 
greener energy. Please give this program the full support it needs and deserves.
