 
Testimony in support of LD 142: "An Act to Fund Climate-related Service Work” sponsored by Representative Morgan Rielly. In support of Representative Reilly’s work, I feel proud to join a fellow young legislator on an important piece of funding legislation which asks us to think about how best to support a strong economic recovery, and challenges us to respond to the threat of climate change by investing in Maines' future.
The Maine Climate Corps Program is one important answer to the question of how we keep young Mainers in Maine, an opportunity to invest in Maine's young people and support local communities to meet their needs through a year of service.
As a state-based service program, funding this program means a broader set of community needs which are diverse as they are disparate can be addressed rather oﬀering climate solutions which are top-down, solutions that are bound exclusively to federally-prescribed funding priorities.
The bill is one committed to the dignity of work, the issuance of a living allowance that supports basic needs. This ensures economic means are not a hidden eligibility requirement and resolves issues a host site could face.
As Representative Reilly has said in the past, this program is designed for the places in Maine "where the greatest assets are human" and the greatest need is "someone to devote time."  
This program is designed speciﬁcally with small communities and micro-organizations across Maine in mind, with a focus for the priorities of rural communities and to assert deﬁnitively that ‘Maine Will Not Wait’ in the ﬁght against climate change.
