Testimony in support of LD 142, An Act to Fund Climate-related Service Work
 
To: Sen. Joseph Rafferty, Representative Michael Brennan, and Members of the Committee 
On Education and Cultural Affairs From: Mainely Agriculture Newspaper
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Committee on Education
and Cultural Affairs, my name is Wallace Sinclair and I live in Brownville.  I am a journalist 
and write about any and all subjects kindred to science, conservation, economics, education 
and climate change, witnessed for many of my 75 years. I am writing to testify in support of 
LD 142.
 
[Progressively we must monitor all things in "the pursuit of happiness" in this modern world as
is the present day lot in life, we now find ourselves a part of.  This not to say all things are or 
can be negatively construed. Often progress can mean or lean towards a not in my back yard 
sort of mentality that is counter to the public good, if one were to equate anti-vaccinationists 
or non-masking folks by example whilst in the midst of a 100 year pandemic or a suffering a 
continuous inability to find a legal argument that several people truly own enough submerged 
ocean frontage by questionable deeds to stop fish farming on dry land v submerged ocean 
pennings.  There are times when common sense is a forgotten matter as if not unreasonable. 
Thank you for reading my testimony.
