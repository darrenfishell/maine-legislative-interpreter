 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly pr esenting  
 LD 142, “  An Act to Fund Climate-r elated Service W ork”  
 Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs  
 Good   afternoon   Senator   Rafferty,  Representative   Brennan   and  distinguished   members   of  the 
 Joint   Standing   Committee   on  Education   &  Cultural   Affairs.   My  name   is  Morgan  Rielly ,  and  I 
 represent   House   District   127,  which   includes   part  of  Westbrook.   I  am  here  today   to  present   LD 
 142,  An  Act  to  Fund   Climate-r elated   Service   Work  ,  which   would   fully   fund  the  existing  
 Maine Climate Corps Program (MCC)   Program.  
 Backgr ound of MCC:  
 During   the  First  Special   session   of  the  130th   Legislature,   the  Environment   and  Natural  
 Resources   (ENR)   Committee   unanimously   passed   my  bill,  LD  722  ,  which   directed   Volunteer  
 Maine   to  study   the  establishment   of  a  Maine   Climate   Corps.   From   August   2021   until  January  
 2022,   Volunteer   Maine   and  the  Maine   Climate   Corps   Report   Oversight   Task  Force,   which   I  was 
 a  member   of,  developed   a  series   of  recommendations   and  identified   priority   projects   for  a 
 Cimate   Corps   to  take  up  and  address.   The  study ,  titled   Maine   Climate   Corps:   Inspir ed  by 
 History .  Designed   for  Today .,  was  finalized   and  submitted   to  the  ENR   Committee   on  January  
 28th  of  last  year.  A  copy   of  the  report   with  its  recommendations   has  been   included   with  my 
 testimony   for  your  review .  I  am  proud   of  what   the  task  force   accomplished.   The  Corps   is  “based  
 on  current   science   and  expressed   need   of  Maine   communities.”   The  MCC   is  rooted   in  service,  
 equity ,  and  good   science.   It  will  and  has  already   served   as  a  bipartisan   model   for  other   states  
 developing Climate Corps.  
 LD  1974   ,  which   was  reported   out  by  ENR,   established   the  MCC   as  laid  out  in  Maine   Climate  
 Corps:   Inspir ed  by  History .  Designed   for  Today   .  It  received   a  unanimous   vote  in  committee   and 
 was  signed   into  law  by  the  Governor .  The  Corps   has  eight   climate-related   focus   areas:   coastal  
 zone,   transportation,   energy,  housing,   land  and  fresh   water   preservation,   community   resilience,

 education,   and  public   health.   This  will  give  the  Corps   the  necessary   flexibility   and  breadth   to 
 work   on  climate   mitigation   issues   along   with  assisting   communities   with  climate   resiliency   in  a 
 variety of focus areas to maximize its impact throughout the state.  
 In  the  report,   and  after  discussing   with  potential   partners   and  communities   across   Maine,   we 
 were   able  to  further   identify   11  priority   projects   for  the  Corps   to  begin   work   on  with  community  
 partners.   These   priority   projects   are  community   resilience   planning,   energy  education   and 
 outreach,   “lead   by  example,”   home   energy  conservation   management,   emer gency   management  
 community   assistance,   healthy   soils  and  regenerative   agriculture   outreach   and  education,   local  
 foods   program,   community   solar   projects,   invasive   species   monitoring   and  management,  
 shoreline monitoring and stabilization, and green schools.  
 Our  initial   request   was  for  a  Corps   of  20  members,   but  were   only  able  to  secure   four.  These  
 Corps   members   will  be  working   with  Downeast   Partners,   the  Community   Action   Program   of 
 Washington   and  Hancock   Counties,   starting   this  spring.   The  Commission   decided   that  it  made  
 sense   to  focus   the  Corps   on  one  priority   and  chose   to  prioritize   energy  conservation   projects   due 
 to the ongoing ener gy crisis here in the state.  
 Service   activities   for  energy  efficiency   include,   but  are  not  limited   to,the   following:   energy 
 audits   of  weatherization   assistance   program   in  clients’   homes,   education   on  energy  efficiency , 
 and  DIY  projects   for  community   residents.   Corps   members   will  receive   extensive   training   and 
 credentials   in  weatherization   that  will  serve   as  an  on-ramp   to  careers   in  the  energy  efficiency  
 sector .  The  Climate   Corps   grant   only  covers   pay  and  benefits   for  the  Corps   members   and 
 supervisors.   The  program   must   leverage   local   resources   for  transportation,   training,   materials,  
 supplies, and administration.  
 Volunteer   Maine,   in  their  testimony ,  can  go  into  further   detail   about   sponsor   qualifications   and 
 sponsor   obligations.   They   can  also  discuss   the  commission's   obligations   and  the  application  
 process   for  both  Corps   members   and  host  communities   and  organizations.   They   will  also  go  into 
 detail about living stipends and benefits for Corps members.

 Goals of LD 142:  
 Volunteer   Maine   cannot   operate   an  effective   program   with  only  four  Corps   members.   Volunteer  
 Maine,   communities   and  organizations   across   the  state,   and  myself   would   like  to  see  a  fully  
 funded program, which LD 142 would accomplish.  
 As  discussed   in  my  testimony   in  LD  143,  service   programs   in  Maine,   as  seen  with  Maine’ s 
 Conservation   Corps,   typically   generate   $3  in  return   investments   for  every   $1  that  is  spent,   which  
 stays   in  the  communities   service   members   operate   in.  AmeriCorps   programing   has  generated  
 roughly   $34  in  return   investment   for  every   federal   dollar   spent.   Our  hope   is  that  in  the  future   we 
 will  be  able  to  use  federal   monies   from   AmeriCorps   to  help  fund  the  Climate   Corps.   Volunteer  
 Maine   has  said  they  would   plan  to  see  a  return   on  investment   for  the  Maine   Climate   Corps   with 
 the  money   staying   within   these   communities,   building   up  local   infrastructure   that  will  make   them  
 and partner or ganizations self-sustaining after Corps members have completed their work.  
 Volunteer   Maine,   through   LD  142,  hopes   to  expand   the  Climate   Corps   program   to  address   the 
 following priority project areas:  
 ●  Energy  “Lead   By  Example”:   Corps   members   will  focus   on  increasing   energy  efficiency  
 and helping public schools and towns save money . 
 ●  Emer gency   Preparedness   and  Natural   Hazard   Mitigation   Planning:   Corps   members   will 
 work   with  small   rural   communities   who  need   help  developing   emer gency   plans   to  access  
 federal funds to mitigate the risk from more extreme storms and other events.  
 ●  Invasive   Species:   Corps   members   will  work   with  communities   that  need   help  with 
 intervention   to  tackle   browntail   moth,   invasive   plants,   green   crabs,   and  more.   This  has  a 
 serious impact on our shellfish fisheries and for our sportsmen.  
 ●  Housing:   Corps   members   will  perform   home   repairs   as  needed   before   weatherization  
 services can be provided to some of the neediest Mainers.  
 The  Maine   Climate   Corps   will  provide   on-ramps   to  meaningful   careers   that  are  in-demand.   Our 
 state’ s  bipartisan   Climate   Corps   will  provide   training,   credentials,   and  on-the-job   experience   that

 will  prepare   Mainers   with  the  skills   needed   by  Maine   employers.   Small   communities   and 
 organizations   need   added   human   resource   capacity   to  combat   some   of  our  biggest   challenges:  
 preventing   tick-borne   illness,   increasing   our  local   food  supply ,  or  helping   seniors   stay  warm   in 
 their homes.  
 Since   July  2022,   Volunteer   Maine   has  connected   with  over  20  Maine   organizations   who  could  
 benefit   from   having   a  Climate   Corps   member .  This  is  an  in-demand   and  popular   program   that 
 needs   additional   funds   to  be  effective   in  aiding   Mainers   in  need   from   the  Downeast   to  the 
 Piscataqua River . 
 This  is  a  fiscally   smart   investment   that  will  leverage   state  and  future   federal   monies   in  order   to 
 make   the  strongest   possible   impact   in  addressing   climate   related   issues   our  state  faces   in  a 
 systematic and ef ficient way . 
 Thank   you  very  much   for  your  time  and  consideration.   I  would   be  happy   to  answer   any  questions  
 or to provide you with any information for your upcoming work session.
