LD 1365
Hello, my name is Nicholas Sevos, a resident of Searsport, and I am writing today to 
give my full support to LD 1365. Voter ID is an incredibly important tool against both
willful election fraud and the mishaps that occur with inflated voter roles in that it 
requires a confirmatory act in the identification of a voter to ensure that persons 
identity is confirmed with that persons vote. While I am not one to normally care 
what other nations do, I think it is worth pointing out that much poorer nations then 
ourselves, such as India, and nations that actually HAD real apartheid and voter 
suppression, such as South Africa, have consistently required voter ID. Additionally, 
the provision mandating that an ID be provided free of charge to someone so that they
may vote is an important step in ensuring everyone is indeed able to vote that should 
be voting, whereas the bill as a whole will help prevent fraud and malfeasance. This 
isn't even a partisan issue, as many on the left have answered in polls that they do 
indeed want voter ID. The only people who are truly opposed to voter ID either want 
to cheat or think so little of others that they think they are unable to act like adults and
get an ID to suit their needs. Election integrity is supposed to be a fundamentally 
sacred portion of our civil discourse, and every step we can take to ensure that results 
are trustworthy will help restore the faith that has been lost in this process.
