Why would we need to change the voter identification rules that are in place now? 
I've not heard of any problems in our current voter identification process. I've not 
heard of any voter fraud in Maine.
Requiring photos on our voter ids would be problematic for anyone who has no 
driver's license or passport. This would make it hard for them to vote. They may be 
unable to vote.
We need to encourage Mainers to vote. Many do not. I'd love to see Maine be 
acknowledged as having the highest numbers of voters in the nation. What an honor. 
Let's not make it harder to vote. Let's keep the voter registration that we have in place 
today.
