LD 1365
Voting is a right given to all legal American citizens. Only American citizens have the
right to vote in our elections. I have been a Warden at the polls for several years. We 
need to have voter ID to ensure that our elections are fair, safe and secure. As a 
worden I have seen some questionable people come in and try to vote without proper 
identification. 
If we do not pass this law to require ID when voting, then our election system is 
compromised. We need to be able to identify who is voting in our elections and this 
bill would help make our elections safe.
I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD1365.
