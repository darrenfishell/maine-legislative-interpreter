LD 1365 An Act to Require Photograph Identification for Voting 
Memorandum of Support 
Date: May 12, 2023 
To: Honorable Members of the Committee On Veterans and Legal Affairs. 
From: Jonathan Martel! 
RE: LD 1365 An Act to Require Photograph identification for Voting 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 1365 An Act to Require Photograph 
Identification for Voting. 
My Name is Jonathan Maitell. l am a Sanford City Councilor, and lifelong resident of Maine. 
This bill simply reduces voter fraud by requiring an lD to cast a vote. No other form of legal business has been 
left wide open for problems like voting. l can't purchase a firearm without one, buy a home, open a bank account 
or a myriad of other business transactions without and lD. Whether or not you believe voter fraud is real, there is 
no valid reason to not strengthen our voting system. A quick Google search will show that there have been 
numerous instances of fraud. Perhaps you've heard of the documentary 2000 mules, where video footage was 
shown of people stuffing ballot boxes in the middle of the night. We should not allow this to happen here. 
Please support strengthening voter rights by voting ought to pass. 
Sincerely, 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME 
Sanford City Councilor
