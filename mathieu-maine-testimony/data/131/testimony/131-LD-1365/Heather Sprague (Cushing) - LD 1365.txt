Good morning Senator Hickman and Representative Supica and distinguished 
members of the Veterans and legal affairs committee.I 
My name is Heather Sprague Im from Gushing and Im here in support of LD 
1365 an act to require photographic identiﬁcation for voting. 
As I speak our southern border is being invaded by millions of illegal 
immigrants.I 
Maine's borders would be overrun as well if we were protecting it instead of 
allowing illegals to be bused from the southern border like Governor Mills and 
so many other elected oﬂicials across Maine have been doing. 
I support LD1365, voter ID because of the problem with illegals. If voter ID isnt 
mandatory or become law in order to vote fraud would be rampant and votes 
from those illegals would cancel out Mainers/Americans OUR votes! 
Seems to me the people that are against voter ID are the same people that are 
for ﬂooding Maine with illegal immigrants and using up valuable resources 
meant for Mainers on those illegals so they will vote for them. 
This is a very dangerous course as far as our voting rights as American 
citizens goes. without voter ID at this point America will fall to the invasion 
and corruption that's being allowed to play out. 
I respectﬁilly ask that you vote to protect Maine voting integrity and vote 
ought to pass. 
As Maine goes, so goes the Nation. 
Protect the citizens you represent, not your special interests. 
Thank you for your time.
