Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Honorable members of 
Veterans and Legal Affairs. 
My name is Sandra Labonte and I live in Searsport. Thank you for this 
opportunity to present this testimony and for your serving the State of 
Maine. 
I stand here in support of LD1365, An Act to Require Photograph 
Identification for Voting. 
-As a poll clerk in Bangor several years ago and now in Searsport, I know 
that it is possible, without requiring a photo ID, for anyone to vote more 
than once. 
This is how it works at polling places. There are people who check voters in 
(the poll clerks). There are usually shifts of different people filling that role 
throughout the 12-hour day. The clerk asks the voter to state their name 
and address and the clerk checks it against the official voter list. If 
conﬁrmed, the voter is handed a ballot and then proceeds to the voting 
booth to vote. 
Without having been asked for a photo ID, the voter could conceivably 
return later, with a different clerk to check him in, using the name of 
someone he knows has died or moved. I know for a fact that the names of 
people who have died or moved several years ago are still on the official 
voter lists. With a photo ID it would be impossible to vote more than once. 
A photo ID is also needed to make sure that the one voting is actually a 
citizen of the United States and has already registered with the state to have 
the privilege of voting.'
. 
No one is disenfranchised by needing a photo ID to drive a car, open a bank 
account, fly on a plane, purchase alcohol, etc. 
I believe that showing an ID at your place of voting would ensure an 
honorable election. 
Thank you for your time. 
Please vote “Ought to pass".
