Testimony in Support of LD 1365
An Act to Require Photograph Identification for Voting 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs:
My name is Nathan Gould, and I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1365, “ An Act 
to Require Photograph Identification for Voting .”
Election integrity should be important to all of us. This bill is another that easily and soundly 
provides for that, while also taking into account the needs of those who may not otherwise be able to 
acquire a Photo ID by means of a “special voter photograph identification card.” Freely supplying those
voters with such a card is well within the services I would expect the Secretary of State to be able to 
perform. 
We must ensure the many various members of the electorate have the highest confidence in 
the democratic process. I am convinced that this bill, along with many others of a similar nature that 
have gone before the Committee, is necessary. Considering the great quantity of testimonies provided 
for those other related bills, I think it does merit further discussion. Regardless of party affiliation or if 
the position up for election is municipal or gubernatorial, secure elections are in the best interests of 
all of us.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
