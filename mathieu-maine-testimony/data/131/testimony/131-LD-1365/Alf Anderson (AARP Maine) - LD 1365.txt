Testimony Opposed to LD 1365 , “An Act to Require Photograph Identification for Voting”  
 
Greetings Senator Hickman , Representative Supica , and Honorable members of the Joint  
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. My name is Alf Anderson , and I am an Associate  
State Director of Advocacy and Outreach for AARP Maine.  
 
AARP is the nation’s largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering  
Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our more than 200,000  
members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony. Today I am here to testify in  
opposition of LD 1365 . 
 
AARP has been fighting to protect the rights of all  Americans 50+ to vote freely, easily,  and safely 
for more than 35 years. We have a long history of non -partisan voter education and engagement, in  
addition to advocacy for fair and straightforward election procedures that help increase the 
participation of  voters aged 50 and older. LD  1365  concerns us because requiring photographic 
identification may  inadvertently create barriers to voting because many voters lack a photo ID . 
Older voter s in particular may  no longer have a license, or other identifying document  and it is very 
difficult for many to obtain one, especially individuals living in very remote parts of the state . Data 
by Project Vote showed that 7 percent of voters lack a proper photo ID. That equates to 16 million 
voters nationwide.1 Requiring a photo ID may also suppress voter turnout. A Government 
Accountability Study that looked at turnout in states that made changes to require a photo ID 
showed  that the measures decreased turnout by 1.9 to 3.2 percentage points .2   
 
LD 1365 ’s photo identification requirements risk an adverse  impact particularly to voters living in 
nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or congregate settings. Many of  these voters live with 
limited incomes  and/or disabilities, and they may find it difficult to acquire  the necessary 
identification to vote. Even if a free ID is offered by the state, there will be barriers for these voters 
to acquiring one as many have mobility issues  and can’t travel to acquire their ID or  have other 
financial barriers. The American Civil Liberties Union estimates th at the combined cost to obtain 
even a free ID  can range from $75 to $175.   
 
Complicating things further , there are no provisions in LD 1365  to educate voters  on these changes, 
which could catch many off -guard, leaving them unable to exercise their  constitutional right.  This 
could lead to many eligible voters , who have been voting for decades, being disenfra nchised when

they arrive to vote at the polls unaware th at they need to have a photo ID. Seniors could  be 
particularly affected .  
 
There is little evidence that this legislation is needed to secure elections in Maine. The Heritage 
Foundation’s voter fraud tracker  has only confirmed two instances of fraud around voting in Maine 
since 2010, and they did not involve voter ID, rather doub le voting instead.3 It is unclear  that this 
bill will even increase voter confidence in elections. A 2022 survey of Maine voters  found that two -
thirds of Mainers felt “very confident” that their votes were accurately counted. 4 
 
AARP supports your goals of secure elections but  requiring a photo ID does not increase election 
security and data shows that it actually reduces turnout. C hanges to the voting process should 
ensure  increased access, fairness, and simplicity; not added barriers and complexity.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on this important bill . If you have question s for 
me, I can be reached at aanderson@aarp.org  or at 207 -330 -1147.  
 
Sincerely,  
Alf Anderson
