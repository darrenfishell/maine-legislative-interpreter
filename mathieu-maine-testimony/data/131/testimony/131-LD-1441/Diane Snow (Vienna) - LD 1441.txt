We are vehemently opposed to Sunday Hunting. Our woods are not for the 
convenience of out of staters. With six days a week available to hunters, one day a 
week for non hunters enjoyment of the woods is necessary. The woods should be 
available to everyone. ( I didn't see a choice for the bill re: Sunday Hunting. Please 
make sure this is the bill I am addressing.)
