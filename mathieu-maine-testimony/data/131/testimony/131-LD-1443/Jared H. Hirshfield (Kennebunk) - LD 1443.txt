Opposition
to
LD
1443 
An
Act
to
Establish
a
Recall
Pr ocess
for
Public
School
Board
Members
Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover ,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on 
State
and
Local
Government,
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
regarding
LD 
1443.
I
will
begin
my
testimony
today
by
highlighting
a
recent
unfortunate
series
of
events
that 
occurred
in
Regional
School
Unit
21,
which
includes
the
towns
of
Arundel,
Kennebunk,
and 
Kennebunkport.
One
of
the
Directors
of
RSU
21
was
recently
caught
posting
racist
and 
homophobic
content
on
his
T witter
page.
The
posts
were
truly
shocking,
especially
considering 
the
position
this
director
held
on
the
school
board.
Shortly
after
the
community
became
aware
of
these
posts,
a
recall
petition
was
taken
out 
in
order
to
start
the
process
of
ousting
this
problematic
director
from
the
RSU
21
School
Board. 
The
director
resigned
shortly
after
when
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
abundant
community 
support
for
the
recall.
As
the
RSU
21
Board
Member
in
question
was
elected
by
Arundel
residents,
the
recall 
process
is
governed
by
the
Arundel
T own
Charter ,
which
requires
signatures
equal
to
at
least
ten 
percent
of
the
votes
cast
in
the
last
Gubernatorial
election.
I
fear
that
if
the
state
were
to
raise
this 
threshold
to
25%,
as
is
proposed
in
this
bill,
it
would
be
immensely
dif ficult
to
recall
school 
board
members.
I
posit
that
the
School
Board
member
I
refer
to
above
may
not
have
resigned 
had
the
threshold
for
recall
been
so
dif ficult
to
reach.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
