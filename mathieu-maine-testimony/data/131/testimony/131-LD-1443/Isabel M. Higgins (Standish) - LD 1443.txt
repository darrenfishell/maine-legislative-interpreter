LD 1443
I am writing in support of LD 1443.  It specifies real grounds for initiating a recall  of 
Public School Board Members by setting specific guidelines for cause,  as well as 
high enough numbers/percentages of  registered local voters  so that it is unlikely to 
be used as retaliation simply because a board member did not vote as  someone 
wished .   As a State regulation, it would level the playing field  in towns and school 
districts both large and small, by specifying a good percentage of actual registered 
voters.   One improvement might be to clearly state that a recall cannot be initiated by
an outside resident, group of outside residents, or any larger organization whose 
agenda is to undermine the integrity  of  school boards and public education....or 
simply that it must be initiated by a registered voter in that town or district, whichever
is more applicable and appropriate (inclusion vs exclusion).  Thank you for your 
consideration.
