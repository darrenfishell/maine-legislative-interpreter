LD 1443
Good morning,
I speak in opposition to LD 1443.  Recall of a non partisan board member is a 
slippery slope.  School boards already have Code of Ethics Regulations, and members
have been duly elected to their positions by the voters of the community.  Adding a 
recall component is government overreach and will have the unintended consequence 
of politicizing boards.
