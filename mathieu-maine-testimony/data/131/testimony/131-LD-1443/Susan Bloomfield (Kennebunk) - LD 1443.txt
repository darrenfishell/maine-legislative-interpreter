LD 1443
I am writing to support Representative Dan Sayerâ€™s LD 1443. I live in Kennebunk and
lived through a recall effort that nearly tore this town apart. A minority of persons 
with unsubstantiated accusations against school board members was able to 
manipulate our (admittedly inadequate) town charter and bring a recall effort to our 
spring ballot. The recall proponents lost 3:1 and thankfully, justice prevailed. We are 
in the process of strengthening our charter so these spiteful shenanigans cannot 
happen again.
In further assurance of keeping recalls few and far between, I understand that 
statewide, LD 1443 will enable Mainers  to challenge and remove school board 
members ONLY if they have been found to have committed specific violations. 
Excellent! Evidence-based and concrete violations. Eliminate the ambiguity that we 
suffered. 
Critically, this bill will insure that a small minority of disgruntled people cannot 
hijack the election process for their own cause. If petitions have to be signed by at 
least 25% of the voters who voted in the last gubernatorial election, that is a 
reasonable, higher bar to achieve, eliminating manipulations by the few, the petty.
Motivated by the horror of the recall effort in Kennebunk, I have been elected to our 
Charter Commission and we are similarly looking to require definite, identifiable, 
evidence-based, provable violations with a substantially higher proportion of voters 
needed for the recall processes steps.
The threat of easy, baseless recalls now hangs like an anvil over Mainers who would 
like to serve their school districts. Please make it more difficult to upend the electoral 
process. Everyone has their say as a voter. Unless egregiously warranted, board 
members should fulfill their terms with single-minded dedication to students and 
teachers.
