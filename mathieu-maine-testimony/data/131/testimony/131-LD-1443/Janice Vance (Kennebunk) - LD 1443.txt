Janice Vance
Kennebunk
LD 1443
Good morning, Senator Nangle, Rep. Stover, and members of the Committee on State
and Local Government.  My name is Janice Vance and I am a resident of Kennebunk. 
I am unable to attend todayâ€™s public hearing due to a work conflict, but wanted to 
urge you to pass LD 1443. In 2022 two Kennebunk members of our RSU 21 school 
board were targeted for a baseless and malicious recall petition, a process that divided
our community, required 420 hours of town staff time for certification of the petition, 
and also resulted in legal fees that had to be borne by taxpayers. There needs to be a 
valid reason to initiate a recall petition against any municipal officer, which I think 
LD 1443 spells out quite well. This seeks a balance between allowing voters the 
democratic right to recall an elected official who has demonstrably violated a law or 
policy, while preventing spiteful and character assassination of volunteers for 
personal amusement of score settling. Kennebunk is not the only town in the state that
has experienced this abuse.  Having LD 1443 in place would protect school board 
members across Maine. Thank you for your consideration.
