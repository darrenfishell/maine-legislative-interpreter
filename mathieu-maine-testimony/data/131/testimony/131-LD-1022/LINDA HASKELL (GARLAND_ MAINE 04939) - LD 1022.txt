LD1022  An Act to Allow School Budget Referenda on the Same Day as Primary 
Elections. Opposition to this Act LD1022   LINDA P HASKELL Garland, Maine
I am opposing this act due to the confusion this will cause due to the many things that 
appear unexpectedly on the school agenda and budgets. This is a very important part 
of our childrens future and education. The organizations that put this together have a 
tremendous amount of responsibilities to get it right. I oppose this Act LD1022.
