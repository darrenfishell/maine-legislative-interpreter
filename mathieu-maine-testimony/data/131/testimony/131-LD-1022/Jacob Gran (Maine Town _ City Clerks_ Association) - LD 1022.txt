Re: LD 1022 – An Act to Allow School Budget Referenda on the Same Day as  
 Primary Elections  
 
Position:  Support  
 
The Maine  Town  & City Clerks’  Association supports LD 1022 and we thank you for the 
opportunity  to outline  our points  for your Committee.  
 It is the responsibility of the municipal clerk to administer and supervise elections in 
accordance with Title 21 -A, Title 30 -A, and Title 20 -A.  
 
Current law allows a regional school unit to select any date for its district budget meeting.  
The budget validation referendum  must occur  on or before the 30
th calendar day following 
the budget meeting. Absentee ballots are to be delivered to the municipal  clerk no later 
than the day after the budget meeting. A regional school unit is not required  to hold the 
budget validation referendum  in conjunction with other state and local elections on the 
second Tuesday in June . 
 
An additional budget validation refer endum results in lower turnout, duplication of work, 
increases costs and difficulty in scheduling workers.  
 
Title 21 -A and 30 -A require that absentee ballots be available for 30 days prior to an 
election. Although Title 20 -A requires the school validation vote to take place on or before 
the 30th day of the district budget meeting, it does not require that absentee ballots be 
available to voters for 30 days prior to the vote.  Even if the state election and school 
election are held on the same day, a duplic ation in mailing of ballots occurs when the 
district budget meeting is held within the 30 days of a state election.  Clerks must also track 
these ballots separate.  
 This process is confusing for the voters and creates the potential  for voter 
disenfranchisement .

Giving the municipality the option of requiring that the budget validation referendum be 
held on the second Tuesday in June will improve voter turnout, will greatly reduce the workload on the municipal clerk, and will reduce overall c osts. Furthermore, having the 
option of requiring that the district budget meeting be held at least  45 days prior to the 
election will ensure that  the absentee process is consistent with that which is  already 
outlined in state law.  
 
Clerks suggest that the committee also consider the following amendments to §1486 of 
Title 20 -A: 
 
• Strike the phrase, “on the day after the conclusion of the regional school unit budget 
meeting and” from subsection 3. D., leaving the sentence to read: “ Absentee ballots 
received b y the municipal clerk may not be processed or counted unless received  
before the close of the polls .” And,  
 
• Strike the phrase, “before the day after the conclusion of the regional school unit 
budget meeting or” from subsection 3. E., leaving the sentence to read: “ All 
envelopes containing absentee ballots received  after the close of the  polls must be 
marked ‘rejected’  by the municipal clerk. ”
