My family has enjoyed 4 generations of camp lease life in Washington County.
We are proud to be good stewards of the land and soak up the life lessons that can be 
learned living in the primitive life style of our camp.
These traditions need to be preserved as they currently are so that generations
to come can share in those same privileges and lessons that are truly priceless.
Please do not let legislature and self-serving outside special interest groups take away 
all that the State of Maine stands for. Please vote no to Bill L.D. 1218 and Bill L.D. 
1219.
Please keep this very unique program of camp lot leasing in place as it is now for 
generations to come.  These types of opportunities are what make Maine the great 
state that it is!
