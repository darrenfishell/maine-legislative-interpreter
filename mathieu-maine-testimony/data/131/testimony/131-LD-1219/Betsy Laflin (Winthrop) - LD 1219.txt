I would like to see rights established for camp lot lease holders to ensure the leases 
will not be sold or taken away from the lease holders. My family has had camps on 
leased land for over 50 years. My parents leased the lots back in the 60s and as 
members of my family were old enough to take over the lease on each lot, they did so 
and built their own camps. I have been going to this same camp since I was 6 months 
old. For over 50 years I have spent my summers and Fall at this camp. My son is 16 
and he has been going here since he was 4 weeks old. In some cases, we have 5 
generations of family spending time at these camps. The leased camp lots and our 
camps are not only a great place to go, but a connection to our parents, who are no 
longer with us, relatives that we spent many weekends with, years of memories we 
cherish and hopefully will be able to for years to come. I hope to pass this camp and 
the lease on to my son so he can someday take his children to this special place and 
that it will always be within the family. I would not want to see someone or some 
company come in and be able to purchase these leases out from under the people who 
have made them a huge part of their lives and family. It might be just a piece of land 
to some stranger or company, but to someone who has grown up in Maine and spent 
their life going to this place, it is extremely important that we establish rights for lease
holders and preserve these lands.
