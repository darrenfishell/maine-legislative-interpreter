I will start by saying I have 5 cats, all kept indoors because I value their health and 
safety.   That said, not all cats are as fortunate.  Many cats have been abandoned by 
human caregivers.  They must roam in search of food and shelter for their survival.  
These are strays that eventually become feral cats, leading short stressful lives.  If 
they are lucky, people trap these unfortunate creatures, neuter them, provide 
veterinary care, and find them homes, barns, or other sheltered locations, where they 
are fed by caregivers.   In this manner, because the cats are no longer able to birth 
litters, they live out their lives and the population ceases to exist.  There are many 
groups in Maine who do this, when they are called upon to help.  But first they need 
to be notified of the existence and location of the ferals!    The ideal would be to have 
people neuter their cat(s), (with Spay ME vouchers, if cost is an issue), for then 
straying ferals would not become a problem.   In short, humane education is the 
answer, along with financial assistance for low-income owners.  I shudder to think 
what would become of unassisted feral cats if the law is changed to include cats as 
"trespassers".
