To State Reps and Others of Concern,
I am writing to you today in opposition to LD 644 - An Act to Include Cats in the 
Laws Governing Animal Trespass.
I am the owner of a strictly indoor house cat, but also the owner of two feral barn cats 
I adopted through Friends of Feral Felines, and also the primary feeder of another 
feral cat that utilises my premises as a safe haven, and food source. 
I adopted the two barn cats as a way to help control a pest situation without having to 
resort to more inhumane methods. These two particular cats have become a huge 
staple in our homestead, and have protected not only our barn and property, but have 
also been a huge part of the family. They aren't housecats, or indoor cats, however 
they are invaluable for working outside in the farm. 
The additional barn cat that we feed and house - we have no idea where he came 
from, however he has also become a welcome addition for keeping not only our 
premises clean, but being taken care of when otherwise left abandoned and without 
refuge.
I am not the only individual who houses, cares for, and takes in stray cats that would 
otherwise be destroyed due to feral nature. 
Organisations such as Friends of Feral Felines, as well as caring homeowners take it upon 
themselves to save otherwise, unsaveable animals. The responsibility also is a wonderful 
thing to the community because of programs like trap-neuter-and-spay. 
I understand the reason this law has been proposed, however some laws while great in
theory, have consequences and make things worse in the long run. Government 
overreach for "the greater good" has consequences for those who are trying to do 
good, and also for those who have done nothing less than help otherwise 
unsalvageable cats. 
I hope that this law can be voted on as NAY and OPPOSED for the sheer reason of 
overreach, unsustainability, and unlikely nature of ever truly being enforced.
