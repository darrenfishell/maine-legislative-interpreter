LD 644
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry,
My name is Roberta Manter and I live in Fayette.  I am writing to ask you to vote AGAINST 
LD 644.  Until now, cats have been excluded from the law regarding Animal Trespass, and for
good reason.  It is said that you do not own a cat - the cat owns you.  To quote Rudyard 
Kipling, the cat says, "I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are alike to me."  
While I understand and sympathize with those who may not want cats on their property, 
enforcement of cat trespass would be difficult if not impossible because cats do not 
understand boundary lines.
Yes, cats may catch birds.  It is, unfortunately, in their nature to do so.  Risk to birds at 
feeders can be minimized by placing feeders in an open area where there is no cover where 
a cat can hide and pounce out unexpectedly.
I am sure some will argue that cats will live longer if they are kept indoors.  This is true, but it's
also true that if the cats are all kept indoors, the rodents who live outdoors on our farm will 
also live longer, and rodents multiply at a phenomenal rate.  Rodents not only contaminate 
feed and damage tack, they also harbor the ticks that carry Lyme disease.  Outdoor cats 
provide us with a valuable service by helping to keep the rodent population down.
Do those who do not welcome our cats on their property welcome the rodents?  Or can we 
extend the trespass laws to include rodents?  After all, the current trespass law applies if, 
"The animal is an immediate danger to itself, persons or another's property."  I would argue 
that a mouse that carries Lyme ticks is an immediate danger to my family, pets, and livestock.
I would suggest that a more appropriate way of limiting cat trespass would be to provide more
funding for the Help Fix ME program so that they can do the valuable work of keeping the 
feral cat population in check.
Thank you.
