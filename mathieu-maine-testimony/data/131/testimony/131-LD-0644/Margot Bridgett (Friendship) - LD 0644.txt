LD 644
I am writing in support of LD644, an Act to Include Cats in the Laws Governing Animal 
Trespass.
I support the inclusion of Cats in this law in order to protect wild birds that cats are known to 
kill.
There are at least 3 cats that visit our yard and stalk birds at our feeder.
Thank you,
Margot Bridgett
