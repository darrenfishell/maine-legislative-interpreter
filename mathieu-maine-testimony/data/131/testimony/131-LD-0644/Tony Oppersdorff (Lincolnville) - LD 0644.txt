LD 644
I strongly support the passage of LD644. I have witnessed far too many roaming cats, often 
thought by their owners to be house bound, hunting and killing our diminishing population of 
song birds. Allowing cats the run of the land must be made illegal. The number of wild birds 
killed by cats annually is beyond precise measure, but is said by many respected sources to 
be in the Billions. This must stop. Please pass LD644.
