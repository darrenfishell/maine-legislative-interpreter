As much as I like cats, I am also in favor of keeping them away from birds. Please 
include cats in LD 644. There are several cats that come into our yard and frighten 
birds from our feeders. (And probably catch some, too, especially in the spring when 
baby birds fall from nests or have trouble learning to fly.) Bird populations are 
declining.
