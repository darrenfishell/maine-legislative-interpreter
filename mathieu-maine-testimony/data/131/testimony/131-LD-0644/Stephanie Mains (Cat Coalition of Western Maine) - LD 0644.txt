Trespassing Law on Cats 
To Committee Members of the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Department 
My name is Stephanie Mains, and I live in the Bridgton area, I have successfully run a TNR PROGRAM, 
SANCTUARY and SMALL SPAY/NEUTER CLINICS here in Western Maine for PAST l3 years 
My concerns about putting a No trespass LAW on Felines here in Maine, this will ultimately be a horror show 
for many feral, stray, barn, and community cats, and mostly the Maine folk who are the ones trying to feed these 
lost souls, they are the ones who are mostly on the poor side here, they are the ones who help these unwanted 
cats especially in the winter months from starving or freezing to death because their original owners are never 
held accountable 
I personally, have spoken to some ACO’s, Law Enforcement and some other local rescues on this subject 
Why would such a law be laid out put into place for trespassing for cats in Maine, that’s like putting a no 
trespassing on a bird, We have many many unwanted cats here as it is, most cats get dumped off at old farms by 
people who no longer want that cute kitten they once had, or throw them outside un-spayed or un-neutered only 
to populate the ever-growing cat population throughout our Maine towns as it is 
Why should folks like these be the ones penalized for helping the unwanted homeless cats by feeding or 
providing shelter, We have this law already in place “you feed a cat for 7 days, it is considered YOUR CAT” 
that is a horrible law. It seems this is a Way for towns in Maine and the State of Maine to not be held 
accountable and have the responsibility not land in their laps. 
My total suggestion here would be to; and yes, I am boots on the ground, I have been for the past l3 years,I 
know what is out there that die on a daily basis 
VVhat about making into a law instead of the trespass law, why not make Owners the ones who are dumping the 
cats have to get their cats ﬁxed before 6 months of age. Penalize them and make some Feline owners be held 
accountable instead of letting these people get away with dumping unﬁxed and unwanted cats, They are the 
problem, not that little old lady or man or family who are trying to save a life by feeding them or giving them 
shelter 
I hear way to often by the folks when We go in to do a TNR they are told by towns or some ACO’s “don’t feed 
them, they will go away” where are the cats going to move to, the next house down the road, that is not how this 
works here, we all are responsible here, the state, the towns, get a grip on the people who are dumping or 
moving away, and leaving their un-ﬁxed cats behind, all this does is add to our already overpopulated feral, 
stray and community cat situation and over stretch our already stressed out ACO’s and/or Law Enforcement 
who already have enough on their plates as it is, who should not have to deal with calls for a no trespassing 
cat(s) 
I Thank you for listening to what I try to teach and educate people on every day 
Thank you
