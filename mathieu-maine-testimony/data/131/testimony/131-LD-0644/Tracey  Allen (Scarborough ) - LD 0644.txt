LD644 An Act to Include Cats in the Laws Governing Animal TrespassI full support banning outside cats. The average lifespan of an outside cat is 7 years! Inside they could live to 20 years old. But mostly I support limiting outside cats for the following reasons.Outside cats:1. Kill- birds (1.2-4 billion!) that eat ticks, ﬂeas and other disease carrying insects like mosquitoes, brown-tail moth caterpillars and damage crops (too many to list), property (termites, carpenter ants,  soil grubs, etc), etc2. Kill- anything else that moves and they can catch from mice, moles, voles, chipmunks, squirrels and rabbits to snakes, frogs, toads, salamanders and other beneﬁcial animals (they all eat larval or adult insects, slugs, etc) and which unfortunately are often endangered. 3. Carry zoonotic diseases (transmissible to humans)-Rabies, Toxoplasmosis, Cryptosporidiosis,  Giardiasis, roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms Tularemia, Bartonella (cat scratch fever), Histoplasmosis, Leptospirosis, mumps, plague,  ringworm, and Salmonellosis. Many of 
which are found in soil and water contaminated by cat feces and expose children and the elderly in yards and gardens.4. Estimated value of damage-$52 BILLION https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-species-cost-billions-damages-global-economy5. Moral Cost-“Birds pollinate plants, spread seeds, control insects and protect environments from the effects of climate change; they are the glue that binds healthy ecosystems together. “Birds are critical,” he says. And outdoor cats, he and other ecologists have determined, are the leading human-inﬂuenced cause of dead birds."Please read this article as it also discusses possible control measures!https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/moral-cost-of-cats-180960505/Tracey Allen113 Ash Swamp RdScarborough, ME 04074
