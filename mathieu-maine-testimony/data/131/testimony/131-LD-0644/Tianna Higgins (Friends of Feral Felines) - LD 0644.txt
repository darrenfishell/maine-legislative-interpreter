I am strongly against this proposed legislation. This is unreasonable and has a 
far-reaching impact on animal control, animal welfare, farm barn cats, community 
feral programs, the courts, and neighborhood relationships.  The ACO's have more 
work then they can already handle.  Any one who owns or cares for unhomed cats are 
not criminals and there should be more programs in place to get this animals altered 
so the population reduces not create laws that cant be enforced.  Please vote NO.
