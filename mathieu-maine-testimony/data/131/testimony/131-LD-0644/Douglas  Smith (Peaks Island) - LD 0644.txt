As the resident of a small community that was experiencing a growing colony of feral
cats, and participated in a Trap, Neuter, & Release effort in concert with ARL, that 
fixed them all, I've learned a great deal about not only feral cats, but also abandoned, 
formerly-owned cats. In this area, ARL of Westbrook, as well as Friends of Feral 
Felines,  Portland,and HART, Cumberland, do wonderful , humane work in  reducing 
homeless cat populations, and placing those that can be placed as Barn Cats, or 
adopted into homes. I have socialized a number of such cats, some of which came 
inside to live, and some that couldn't make that leap of trust, but I could care for 
despite their living outdoors, in shelters made for them. Though there are indeed 
concerns with free-roaming cats,  esp. the loss of songbirds, there is another side to 
that coin. In many neighborhoods, including my own, mice are a serious problem for 
property owners, and cats are one of the only natural controls on their population. I 
am very disturbed, re a change in the Animal Trespass Law, that not only would 
homed and un-homed cats become subject to seizure and euthanasia, but those like 
myself that strive to care for and whenever possible place them, could be subject to 
criminal charges or fines for exercising their humanity toward these intelligent and 
affectionate creatures.
