Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Committee, I am Ann Gibbs 
and I am the Division Director of Animal and Plant at the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry. I am here today to speak in opposition to LD 644, An Act to Include 
Cats in Animal Trespass.O 
LD 644 does not provide information as to what issue the bill aims to address. In your 
deliberations, we urge the Committee to consider the following. 
First, we believe amending state statutes to include cats would pose signiﬁcant enforcement 
challenges. For our animal trespass laws to be triggered, an authorized member of the 
Department or an Animal Control Ofﬁcer must ﬁrst notify the owner that the animal was found 
on that property. That means any enforcement action must be preceded by law enforcement 
being contacted, ithewjiurisdictioinal entity being dispatched, and the enforcement agent or officer 
observing and identifying the animal at the location. Because few of the agencies involved 
(including the Department) have staffing sufficient to dispatch an ofﬁcer or agent immediately to 
any non-emergency complaint, we consider this chain of events improbable and likely 
ineffective. 
Second, and perhaps more importantly, a relevant and enforceable statute exists. 7 MSRS §396l 
states in part, “When an animal damages a person or that person’s property due to the negligence 
of that animal’s owner or keeper, the owner or keeper of that animal is liable in a civil action to 
the person injured for the amount of damage done.” Cats are not excluded from this provision. 
We do not believe that revoking the exclusion of cats from our Trespass of Animals statute will 
result in any meaningful improvement for the people and animals of Maine. Thank you for your 
consideration, and I am happy to answer questions now or during the work session.
