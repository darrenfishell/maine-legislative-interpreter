To the Committee:
Domestic cats are a serious cause of wild bird mortality, and thus must be added to the 
animal trespass law. To exclude cats, as in the present statute, is to knowingly tolerate the 
decline of bird species due to domestic cat predation, which is especially pronounced around 
the many backyard bird feeders. The State prides itself on its commitment to wildlife 
management, and should therefore take steps to protect songbirds, one of its most vulnerable
animal groups.
