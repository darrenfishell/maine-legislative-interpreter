NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST LD 56 
An Act to Provide Free Admission to State Parks and Historic Sites for the Spouses and 
Children of Veterans Holding Free Day Use Passes 
January 25, 2023 
Senator Ingwerson, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Andy Cutko, and I am the Director of the 
Bureau of Parks and Lands. I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry (DACF) neither for nor against LD 5 6, An Act to Provide Free 
Admission to State Parks and Historic Sites for the Spouses and Children of Veterans Holding 
Free Day Use Passes. 
Maine State Parks and Historic Sites currently allow free day-use access to senior citizens, 
children under ﬁve, Maine veterans, gold star families, and military service members on active 
duty. This bill would extend free access to Maine State Parks and Historic Sites for the spouse 
and children of a veteran holding a free day-use pass. We currently extend free access to spouses 
and children of active military members, but We do not extend free access to family members of 
others with free status. 
Because fees from State Parks are directed to the state’s General Fund, this bill will have a ﬁscal 
impact. To calculate the ﬁscal impact, We Would need to estimate the level of State Park use by 
veterans ’ spouses and children, accompanied by a veteran -- but only those spouses under 65 and 
children over ﬁve. Because the Bureau does not collect data on State Park use by veterans, the 
ﬁscal impact is difficult to estimate. 
Maine veterans have provided an immeasurable service to our state and nation, and their families 
have made sacriﬁces that enabled and endured their service. If the Committee ﬁnds the ﬁscal 
impact acceptable, this bill would recognize those sacriﬁces by facilitating family gatherings at 
State Parks and Historic Sites for Maine veterans. 
Thank you for your time. I Would be happy to answer any questions now or at the Work session.
