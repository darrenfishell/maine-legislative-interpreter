in

of
LD
993:
An
Act
to
Facilitate
Stakeholder
Input
Regarding
For est
Policy
in
Maine
Before
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry
Senator
Ingwersen,
Representative
Pluecker ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry
Committee.
I
am
Laurie
Osher
and
I
represent
District
25,
the
majority
of
Orono.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
express
my
support
for
LD
993:
An
Act
to
Facilitate
Stakeholder
Input
Regarding
For est
Policy
in
Maine.
I
come
to
you
with
a
request
to
support
this
bill,
not
only
as
your
colleague,
but
as
soil
scientist
with
experience
with
the
importance
of
stakeholder
input.
I
worked
on
the
staff
of
National
Forests
in
Alaska
and
Colorado
and
on
the
Forest
Management
team
of
a
National
Forest
in
California.
In
each
location,
I
had
a
front
row
seat
to
the
development
and
implementation
of
forest
management
planning
by
the
nation’ s
premier
forest
land
management
agency .
The
scientists
at
my
agency
were
knowledgeable
about
the
science
of
forestry ,
but
the
system
was
set
up
to
share
the
plans
with
stakeholders
near
the
end
of
the
planning
process.
During
those
years,
USDA
Forest
Service
forest
management
plans
were
regularly
contested
by
stakeholders
who
had
been
left
out
of
the
planning
process.
The
first
of
my
forest
service
jobs
was
at
the
Tsongas
National
Forest
in
SE
Alaska.
I
was
hired
to
join
a
team
that
was
completing
an
inventory
of
soils
and
forest
ecosystem
types.
It
was
an
expensive
data
gathering
experience
because
it
was
executed
in
response
to
a
lawsuit
by
environmental
non-profit
organizations
contesting
the
forest
management
plan.
Our
team
of
6
lived
on
a
boat
and
were
flown
into
the
forested
mountains
each
day.
If
that
work
had
been
done
as
part
of
the
original
forest
plan,
the
team
would
have
been
camping
out,
and
using
less
expensive
means
of
transportation.

The
forest
plans
on
all
three
of
those
National
Forests
proposed
timber
sales
on
sacred
areas
of
the
indigenous
peoples
and
none
of
the
forest
planners
consulted
with
representatives
of
the
tribes
early
in
the
planning
process.
There
were
complaints
and
challenges
and
lots
of
evidence
that
involving
stakeholders
early
may
be
a
good
idea.
Since
then,
the
federal
government
has
changed
land
management
policies
to
ensure
that
stakeholders
have
a
voice
in
the
creation
of
National
Forest
policy
and
laws
have
been
created
to
encourage
communication
between
government
scientists
and
community
representatives
at
the
state
level.
This
board
will
advise
the
bureau
on
conditions
and
trends
in
the
forests
of
the
State,
facilitate
dialogue
between
representatives
of
communities
with
diverse
interests
with
respect
to
our
forests,
and
provide
input
in
the
development,
updating,
and
implementation
of
the
state
forest
action
plan.
The
board
will
have
21
members;
4
appointed
by
the
Governor ,
9
appointed
by
the
Senate
President,
and
8
appointed
by
the
Speaker
of
the
House.
It
will
meet
at
least
four
times
a
year.
I
thank
Representative
O’Neill
for
sponsoring
LD933.
LD933
creates
the
Maine
Forest
Advisory
Board
to
advise
the
Department
of
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry’ s
Bureau
of
Forestry .
The
creation
of
this
board
is
required
under
one
of
those
laws
created
since
I
left
the
employ
of
the
USDA
Forest
Service:
the
federal
Food,
Conservation,
and
Energy
Act
of
2008.
I
encourage
you
to
vote
to
pass
LD
993:
An
Act
to
Facilitate
Stakeholder
Input
Regarding
For est
Policy
in
Maine.
