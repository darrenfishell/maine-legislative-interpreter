Testimony of Rep. Maggie O’Neil 
LD 993, An Act to Facilitate Stakeholder Input Regarding Forest 
' 
Policy in Maine_ 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and F orestrjy 
Good morning, Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and distinguished members of thei 
Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry, I am Representative 
Maggie O’Neil of Saco. I am pleased to present to you LD 993, An Act to Facilitate 
Stakeholder Input Regarding Forest Policy in Maine. 
Maine is the most forested state in the country with 17.5 million acres of forest. That forest is an 
extraordinary asset: (1) it cleans our air and our water; (2) it supports an $8.1 billion forest 
products industry, which relies on more than 5,000 loggers; (3) it contributes to our $7 billion 
tourism industry, including the $3 billion outdoor recreation sector; and (4) it protects 
biodiversity and helps mitigate climate change. Maine forest is critical, and it becomes more 
important every day. 
Mainers have a long history of having access to the forest to recreate and hunt, thanks to the 
generosity of private landowners. Our north woods is synonymous with remote hunting, ﬁshing, 
canoeing, and hiking. Perhaps in part because of that access, we might take the forest for granted, 
forgetting how special it is, and thinking it will always be here. 
Despite being largely privately owned, the forest is vitally important to all of us. 
Maine’s north woods sit at the heart of the Acadian-Northem Appalachian Forest, the largest and 
most intact temperate forest in the world. It holds at least. 139 rare plants and animals, 21 of them 
globally rare. Maine is home to the only population in the U.S. of endangered Atlantic Salmon—~ 
an anadromous ﬁsh whose life cycle begins in the cold, clear Waters of our forest. That Water 
supports one of only two U.S. populations of native, wild Arctic Charr—the other population is 
in Alaska. Maine is the last stronghold for native and wild Brook Trout, with 97% of the

other states have forest advisory boards, including neighboring New Hampshire. As the most 
forested state in the nation, why wouldn’t Maine also Want a consistent, public stakeholder forum 
to gather input and discuss solutions? 
I’d like to address what the bill does not do. It does not impose solutions. It does not give 
policymaking authority to the board. It does not seek a staff and budget. It does not replicate an 
existing effort by the Maine Forest Service. Instead, it creates, for the ﬁrst time, a consistent 
public forum to comprehensively discuss Maine forest and its challenges. 
I am open to a discussion of exactly which stakeholders should serve on the board, and how they 
are named. What is important is that We look at and discuss in an open forum all the aspects of 
the forest: (a) its importance to our economy and Working families; (b) its role in providing 
habitat; (c) its importance to our clean air, clean Water, and climate change mitigation; and (d) 
the very real threats to its future.' 
You don’t know What you’ve got until it’s gone. Maine’s forest is too important to take for 
granted. Passing LD 993 is one small step We can take to ensure the health and well-being of 
Maine forest before it’s too late. 
Thank you.
