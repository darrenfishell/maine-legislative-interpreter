Testimony of Hilary Schneider, Regional Government Relations Director,  
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  
 
In Support of LD 759 “An Act to Reduce Out -of-pocket Prescription Drug Expenses for Coinsurance ” 
March 7 , 2023  
Senator Bailey , Representative Perry , and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
Committee . My name is Hilary Schneider, and I am the Regional Government Relations Director of the North 
Atlantic  Region for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN).  In this role, I serve as the 
lead Government Relations Director for Maine. ACS CAN, the nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate of the 
American Cancer Society, supports evidence -based policy and legislative solutions designed to eliminate cancer 
as a major health problem. As the nation’s leading advocate for public policies that ar e helping to defeat cancer, 
ACS CAN ensures that cancer patients, survivors, and their families have a voice in public policy matters at all 
levels of government.  
As you likely know, one of the biggest worries a patient faces when they hear the life-altering words “you have 
cancer” is “how am I going to afford this diagnosis?”  One in two men and 1 in 3 women are expected to be 
diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.i The American Cancer Society estimates that 8,920 Mainers will be 
diagnosed wit h cancer and that 3,500  will die from the disease in this year alone.ii Cancer is the leading cause of 
death in Maine.iii For these patients and their families, the costs associated with direct cancer care are 
staggering.   
As discussed in more detail in ACS CAN’s 2020 report on the costs of cancer, “[b]ecause of high costs, many 
people with cancer and those who have survived cancer experience financial hardship, including problems 
paying bills, depletion of savings, delaying or skipping needed medical car e, and potential bankruptcy.”iv 
Moreover, these costs and hardships do not impact all cancer patients equally —patients who are younger, 
members of communities of color, have not yet obtained a high school education, and those with lower incomes 
are more li kely to experience financial hardship.  Many of these individuals will continue to be affected by their 
cancer or its treatment for 
months, years and decades 
after initial diagnosis and 
treatment.  
The costs of cancer – and 
the impact of these costs – 
do no t end when active 
treatment ends. Individuals 
face ongoing financial 
impact.  As shown here and 
described in more detail  in 
ACS CAN’s 2022 report on

related treatments. Moreover, cancer survivors, especially those age 18 -64, feel worried about paying medical 
bills and have higher annual out -of-pocket medical costs than individuals with no history of cancer.v 
One of the findings outlined in this cancer survivo rship costs report is that out -of-pocket caps help make cancer 
survivorship more affordable. Out -of-pocket caps protect cancer patients from having even higher costs and  
create some predictability in budgeting for health care expenses. The report depicts the experiences of a 
handful of cancer survivors, showing in more detail the types of costs cancer survivors face, as well as how 
health  
Insurance coverage impacts affordability and their experiences in dealing with medical costs. ACS CAN’s research 
show s that while radiation treatments and surgery/hospital inpatient costs are often large cost drivers for 
cancer patient in active treatment, prescription drug costs tend to be the largest cost drivers for cancer 
survivors.  
LD 759 proposes to reduce the out-of-pocket cap on prescription drug costs from $3,500 to $1,500 for health 
insurance plans that have a separate out -of-pocket cost maximum for  prescription drug coverage. As you can 
see in the examples above, cancer patients and survivors have a variety  of health care needs, not only when 
they are in active treatment, but also often after treatment ends. As such, separate medical and prescription 
drug ou t-of-pocket caps  can expose patients to higher overall out -of-pocket costs and can make budgeting  and 
predictability of cost exposure more challenging. While one could argue that  the impact of this bill could be 
limited if  health plans c hoose to  sell more plans with one out -of-pocket cost cap for major medi cal and 
prescription drugs that is higher , it is i mportant to recognize that federal law  limits the overall out -of-pocket cost 
maximumvi and offers cost-sharing subsidies  through marketplace plans  so that individuals and families do not 
pay more than 8.5% of their household income for health insurance.  One out -of-pocket maximum for both 
major medical and prescription drug coverage often makes it easier for consumers to understand their health 
plan coverage and their out -of-pocket cost exposure.
