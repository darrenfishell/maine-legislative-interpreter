LD 1051
Dear Committee on Taxation Chair and Members, 
We urge you to end the sales tax on precious metals in Maine,
Continued inaction on LD 1051 will harm both businesses and
citizens of Maine,.Gold and Silver are money, and money should
not be taxed. Forty Two states presently support our position on 
this issue. Thank You for your time and consideration on LD 1051.
                                                      Gratefully,
                                                  Robert Rosati Family
