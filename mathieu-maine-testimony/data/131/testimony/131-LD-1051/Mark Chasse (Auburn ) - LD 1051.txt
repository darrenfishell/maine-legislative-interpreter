LD 1051 ought-TO-pass as this tax burden is regressive in that it presents 
consequences by potentially holding seniors hostage to state programs when they can 
hold precious metals in a retirement portfolio as  means to counteract inflation. This is
the case in our current economic environment.
Thank you.
