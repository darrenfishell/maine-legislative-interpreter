South Portland 
LD 71
I am FOR the passage of LD71. 
As a member of this community that may very well be considering a "sacrifice zone" 
I am overwhelmingly concerned with the health and wellbeing of myself and my 
neighbors due to emissions from the 120 petroleum tanks in South Portland. 
I can't stress enough the importance of preserving strong mandated fence line 
monitoring and biannual testing of the heating tanks. 
I am strongly encouraging the ENR to reduce the maximum time allowed between 
passage of the rules and implementation from 15 months to 9 months. 
The repercussions of cutting corners of fenceline monitoring is staggering and I am 
urging our representatives to do the right thing and vote for the passage of LD71
