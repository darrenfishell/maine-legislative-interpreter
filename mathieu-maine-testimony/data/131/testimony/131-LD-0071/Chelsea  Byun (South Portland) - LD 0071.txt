PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF LD71
I am a resident of South Portland and Iâ€™m writing to express my support for approval 
of the rules written to comply with LD71, including the fenceline monitoring 
provisions. This law will provide long-awaited and much-needed data regarding the 
air quality in neighborhoods in which bulk petroleum tank farms are embedded. These
tanks are part of our community landscape. We sleep, work, play and learn directly 
alongside them, while the oil companies that own them profit and the rest of the state 
benefits from the burden we bear. We deserve to know how the tanks are affecting the
air we breath. Please preserve the integrity and intent of this law, make sure that it is 
implemented as quickly as possible, and make the data collected easily accessible to 
the public.
Thank you.
