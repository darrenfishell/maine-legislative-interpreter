Brianna Bowman
South Portland
LD 71
Good Morning,
My name is Brianna Bowman and I am a South Portland resident living on a 
residential street that terminates at the tank field. I am writing “for" the passage of 
LD71.
Living near the tanks upends the reality that home is a place where my family can be 
safe from harm. There are days where the tank fumes are so strong that it burns my 
eyes to walk outside to tend my garden. On summer days when the breeze is warm 
and the windows are open, we wake to the bedroom air thick with petroleum fumes. 
Noxious fumes are disturbing, however the DEP noted, when they placed a 
monitoring device in our yard years ago, that the most toxic fumes are the ones you 
can’t smell. The idea that my family is being silently poisoned creates a sense of 
dread that only good information about actual levels of exposure and the hope of 
change can pacify. 
Mandated fenceline monitoring and biannual testing are the most simple and effective
tools available to understand how much of the tank emissions are going into 
surrounding neighborhoods like mine. These neighborhoods contain senior centers, 
daycares, community centers and homes of countless families. 
In addition to protecting monitoring and testing, I am also asking you to support the 
public, timely availability of raw data and analysis, so I can understand what I am 
being exposed to without the polish or spin of a well-funded communications 
campaign.
There  are 120 petroleum tanks in South Portland which are permitted by the Maine DEP to 
emit 630 tons per year of volatile organic compounds and 104 tons per year of hazardous air 
pollutants. It is essential to know what toxic chemicals are coming out of the tanks, and it 
should be the responsibility of oil companies to collect and disseminate this information if they
wish to remain embedded in our communities. 
.
Thank you for the opportunity to share my experience.
