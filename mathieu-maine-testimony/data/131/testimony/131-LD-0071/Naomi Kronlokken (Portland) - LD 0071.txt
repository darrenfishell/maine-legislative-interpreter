LD 71
As a resident of Portland's west end, I am writing in favor of the passage of LD71.
It is extremely important to preserve the mandated fenceline monitoring as a way of 
knowing how much of the tank emissions are going into the community. This data 
should also be made easily available to the public who live in the surrounding area. 
We need to know what toxic chemicals are coming out of these tanks. 
It is important health justice issue for those living near the tanks.
