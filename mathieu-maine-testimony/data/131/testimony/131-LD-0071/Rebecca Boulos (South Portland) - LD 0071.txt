Good morning, Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich , and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. My name is Rebecca Boulos. I am a resident of South Portland and writing to express my support for LD 71: Resolve, 
Regarding Legislative Review of Chapter 171: Control of Petroleum Storage Facilities, a Major 
Substantive Rule of the Department of Environmental Protection. 
 The provisions in these proposed rules reflect recommendations of the 
South Portland Clean Air 
Advisory Committee (CAAC ). Here is the Committeeâ€™s final report for your refe rence and 
review . I serve as a member of t he CAAC , but the views in this testimony are my own. I do not 
speak on behalf of the Committee . 
 Specifically, I want to indicate  my support for the  new requirements for reporting, f enceline 
monitoring, and  continuous measurement of actual emissions from heated petroleum storage 
tanks . 
 As a public health professional, I believe these proposed rules  will pro vide needed information 
about ambient air quality in the neighborhoods adjacent to the tank farms. These data will enable us to better protect public health, promot e environmental justice, and support safe communities 
in Maine. I respectfully request the committee vote in favor of LD 71 . Thank you for your 
consideration.
