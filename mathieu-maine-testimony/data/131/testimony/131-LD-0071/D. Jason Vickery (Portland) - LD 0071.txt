LD 71
To Whom It May Concern
I am writing to state I am for the passage of LD 71.  LD 71 is a straightforward and cost 
effective means to compel the oil companies operating in South Portland to provide 
reassurance to the residents of the community that their operation is not creating a safety 
hazard.  The fence line monitoring requirement of the oil companies is an important 
component to demonstrate they are not creating a air quality issue for the community.  And its
a common sense approach.  Thank you.
