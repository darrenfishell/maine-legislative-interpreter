LD 71
I am writing is support for the passage of LD71.  The public has every right to protect their 
health when it comes to excessive toxic emissions from oil tanks.  The fenceline monitoring is
an easy and essential way to help protect the people of South Portland, especially its most 
vulnerable; elders, people with respiratory issues and children.  
There are 120 petroleum tanks in South Portland which are permitted by the Maine DEP to 
emit 630 tons per year of volatile organic compounds and 104 tons per year of hazardous air 
pollutants. It is essential to know what toxic chemicals are coming out of the tanks and how 
much is going over the fenceline into the neighborhoods closest to the tanks. Fenceline 
monitoring is crucial to getting that information.   And, let's be honest, the cost of this is 
neglible and the oil industry should pay for this cost-effective system that helps to ensure the 
health of people in South Portland.
Please expedite this process.  The quality of the air the citizens breath has been left 
unchecked for long enough
