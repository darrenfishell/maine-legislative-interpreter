LD 71
I am writing to support the passage of LD 71. Why in the world would anyone 
consider NOT monitoring the fence line of potentially deadly oil storage tanks and 
pipelines? I live in South Portland with two toddlers. I want them to grow up in a safe 
environment with clean air and water. Fenceline monitoring is a simple and effective, 
EPA approved way of knowing how much of the tank emissions are going into the 
surrounding communities. Why wouldn't we do it? Let's not bury our heads in the 
sand. Let's get immediate and accurate measurements. Hopefully, there is no issue 
and then we'll know. However, if monitoring shows a problem, then we can figure out
the best ways to remediate it. 
Additionally, we should get this under way now! Please reduce the maximum time 
allowed between passage of the rules and implementation from 15 months to 9 
months. The people have been waiting long enough.There are 120 petroleum tanks in 
South Portland which are permitted by the Maine DEP to emit 630 tons per year of 
volatile organic compounds and 104 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants. It is 
essential to know what toxic chemicals are coming out of the tanks and how much is 
going over the fenceline into the neighborhoods closest to the tanks. Fenceline 
monitoring is crucial to getting that information. 
The oil companies have posted enormous, record-setting profits this year. They can 
afford the minimal cost of fenceline monitoring and biannual testing of heated tanks.
