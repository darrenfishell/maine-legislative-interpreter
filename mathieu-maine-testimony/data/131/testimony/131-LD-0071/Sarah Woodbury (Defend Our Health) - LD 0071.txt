Toxic-Free Tomorrow 
Testimony of Sarah Woodbury, Director of Advocacy, Defend Our Health 
In Support of LD 71, “Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of Chapter 171: Control of 
Petroleum Storage Facilities, a Major Substantive Rule of the Department of Environmental 
Protection ” 
Before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee A 
February 8, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Enviroment and 
Natural Resources Committee: My name is Sarah Woodbury, and l am the director of advocacy 
for Defend Our Health. l currently reside in Freeport but used to live in South Portland. Defend 
Our Health's mission is to make sure that everyone has equal access to safe food and drinking 
water, healthy homes and products that are toxic-free and climate friendly. Please accept this 
testimony in support of LD 71, “Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of Chapter 171: Control 
of Petroleum Storage Facilities, a Major Substantive Rule of the Department of Environmental 
Protection" . 
The so-called “tank farm” facilities in South Portland are a source of numerous, well-founded 
concerns about the health and safety impacts on the community of South Portland. As we 
began learning more than three years ago, oil tank owners have violated safety regulations for 
allowable levels of toxic emissions from their tank farms, including the permitted limit of volatile 
organic compounds. 
Some of the groups most vulnerable to these toxic chemicals are pregnant women, babies, and 
young children. Toxic chemical exposure threatens children ’s developing bodies and brains with 
health harms that can have lifelong impacts. Residents of several South Portland 
neighborhoods who have been disproportionately exposed to toxic chemicals because where 
they live happens to be where the global businesses that own and proﬁt from the oil-tank fanns 
are failing to safeguard human health. 
During the rulemaking, we, along with many others, testiﬁed that in addition to fenceline 
monitoring for benzene, facilities should be required to measure for ethylbenzene, toluene and 
xylenes as well. We are pleased to see that these requirements have been added to the draft 
rules. Fenceline monitoring is incredibly important to the communities affected and provides vital 
information to impacted communities about exposure. Fenceline monitoring and the biannual 
testing of heated tanks called for in the rule will and should be paid for by the oil companies. 
The cost of this monitoring should be covered by the oil industry given they are responsible for 
these toxic materials ending up in the community. The cost of testing & monitoring is negligible 
compared to the healthcare costs that the community bears due to exposure. We urge the 
committee to avoid weakening any of the fenceline monitoring requirements that are in the 
current draft rule.

We appreciate the hard work that the DEP and the BEP has done on this rule to strengthen this 
rule. While we support the implementation of this rule, we would request that the committee 
consider reducing the maximum time allowed between passage of the rules and implementation 
from 15 months to 9 months. While we recognize that the DEP has limited bandwidth but, we 
also know that the citizens of South Portland have been waiting too long for these rules to be 
implemented and shouldn't have to wait any longer. 
Defend Our Health thanks the department and the committee for their hard work on this issue 
and urges the committee to unanimously vote “ought to pass” on LD 71. 
Thank you for your time.
