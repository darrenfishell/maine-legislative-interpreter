LD 71
To the members of the Environment & Natural Resources Committee,
My name is Caitlin Marshall, and I live in the North Deering neighborhood of 
Portland.  
I am FOR the passage of LD 71.  Fence line monitoring is an EPA recommended, 
simple and effective way to know how much pollution is actually emitted by the tanks
and reaching people in the surrounding neighborhoods.  
The 120 petroleum tanks in South Portland are permitted by the Maine DEP to emit 
630 tons per year of volatile organic compounds and 104 tons per year of hazardous 
air pollutants.  Fence line monitoring is essential to determining whether the actual 
emissions are within these limits.
It is not fair to ask the people of South Portland to bear the cost of worse health by 
being exposed to high levels of emissions.  The relatively small cost of installing 
monitoring, to protect our neighborsâ€™ health, can and should simply be a cost of doing
business for the oil companies.  
Thank you for accepting my testimony.
