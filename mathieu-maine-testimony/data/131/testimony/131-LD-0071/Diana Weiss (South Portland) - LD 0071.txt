LD 71
I am for the passage of LD71 to protect my family and community from potentially harmful 
pollution. The public has a right to know what extent the toxic emissions surrounding the 6 
tank farms with 120 tanks are going into our neighborhood. I live less than a half mile from the
tanks and have regularly smelled noxious gas like odors especially on summer nights when 
our windows are open.
Fenceline monitoring and biannual testing of heated tanks is relatively inexpensive and will be
paid for by the oil companies. The DEP has said that they do not have the resources to 
continue monitoring and have been unwilling to move the monitoring closer to the tanks. 
Given the oil industry's enormous profits, the cost of testing & monitoring is negligible 
compared to the healthcare burdens and financial costs to the community.
Our community has waited long enough for testing to be implemented.
