LD 71
I am in support for LD71. I believe in the importance of preserving fenceline 
monitoring and biannual testing of heated tanks in South Portland is a simple and cost
effective tool to observe tank emissions in relationship to neighborhoods closest to the
120 petroleum tanks. My family had our child at Kaler Elementary School while 
residing in a duplex home located within the school district, although several miles 
away. The location of homes, schools, daycares, senior housing, community center, 
and businesses that people in our community use daily are close to the tank farm 
facilities and are vulnerable to potential emissions. In addition, I encourage the ENR 
to reduce the maximum time allowed between passage of the rules and 
implementation from 15 months to 9 months, and raw monitoring data and analysis of
that information should be made available to the public in an easily accessible way. I 
appreciate your consideration.
