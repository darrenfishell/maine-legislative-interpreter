LD 71
Dear Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
In my testimony as a Portland resident (and founder of Elders for Future 
Generations), I urge you to pass LD 71.
I'd like to take this occasion to thank you again for all the work you did on LD 163 for
protection of all the people living near and among the 120 gas tanks (6 tank "farms") 
in South Portland. Your support meant, and continues to mean, so much to everyone 
in the community. It would be such a waste of everyone's energy and intentions if the 
bill was not fully implemented. 
The oil industry (to no one's surprise) has advocated against full implementation of 
LD 163 during the process of developing regulations for implementation of the bill.
To counter this push back by the oil industry, I urge you (and ultimately the State 
Legislature) to pass LD 71. Further, I request that the timeframe for implementation 
be moved from 15 months to 9 months.
Fenceline monitoring and bi-annual testing of heated tanks is simple, effective, 
approved by the EPA, and not too much to ask of oil companies. As citizens, we have 
the right to know how much toxins are being emitted into the surrounding 
neighborhoods where schools, playgrounds and vulnerable elderly residences exist. 
And the oil industry has the responsibility to protect the residents where it does it's 
business.
Please pass LD 71.
