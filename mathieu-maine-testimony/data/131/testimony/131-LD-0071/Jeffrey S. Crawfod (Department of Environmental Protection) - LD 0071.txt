LD 71, Resolve Regarding Legislative Review of Chapter 171, A Major Substantive Rule of the 
Department of Environmental Protection 
Written Testimony of Jeffrey Crawford/DEP 
Public Hearing: February 8, 2023

Environmental Protection, speaking in support of L.D. 71. I am here to present this 
provisionally adopted rule of the Board of Environmental Protection (Board) and request 
the Committee's recommendation for Legislative adoption. On June 21, 2021, 
Governor Mills signed into law L.D. 163, An Act To Revise Maine’s Environmental 
Laws. This legislation established several new requirements for petroleum storage 
facilities located throughout the state. As required by the legislation, the Department 
has initiated rulemaking and provisionally-adopted a new rule, Chapter 171, to 
implement the requirements of LD 163. On February 3, 2022, the Board held a public 
hearing on the Department ’s rulemaking proposal; the public comment period 
subsequently closed on February 18, 2022. Comments were received from 43 
interested persons and parties during the public comment period. These comments are 
summarized, and the Department's responses are set forth in the Basis Statement and 
Response to Comments document in your materials. On May 5, 2022, the Board voted 
to provisionally adg‘ " 
~»~;as.- 
ln developing this regulation, the Department reviewed and took into consideration 
several relevant resources, including: 
o The findings and recommendations of its January 2021 report to this~committee 
on petroleum storage tank emissions; 
0 Federal regulations pertaining to monitoring of emissions from oil reﬁneries; 
o Guidance documents and draft SOPs provided by EPA; and 
~ Responses to specific questions posed in a public request for information from 
stakeholders including regulated entities, environmental consultants, and the City 
of South Portland. 
The proposed rule establishes new control, operating, inspection, testing, monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for petroleum storage facilities, including: 
o Requiring new distillate tanks to be constructed with an internal ﬂoating roof; 
o Requiring heated storage tanks be fully insulated to reduce breathing emissions;

0 Prohibiting switchloading,‘ 
which is the uncontrolled loading of distillate into trucks 
which previously carried gasoline; 
0 implementing a quarterly inspection program using optical gas imaging equipment 
to look for leaks; 
0 Requiring additional visual and instrumental inspections of tanks with internal 
floating roofs; 
\ ~ Testing of emissions from heated tanks twice per year; and 
o implementation of a fenceline monitoring program which requires each facility to 
deploy passive monitors around their facility that are collected and analyzed every 
two weeks. 
This broad range of new requirements is intended to minimize emissions from petroleum 
storage facilities and provide the Department and the public more frequent, accurate, and 
detailed information about the air emissions from these facilities. 
I would also like to call to your attention the Board of Environmental Protection's 
concerns regarding the fenceline monitoring requirements contained in statute and the 
Department's provisionally adopted rule. ln correspondence dated July 7, 2022, and 
submitted to the Committee along with the Department ’s provisionally adopted rule, the 
Board expressed its concerns regarding the of utility of fenceline monitoring, especially 
for source apportionment purposes (i.e., determining the source of air emissions) when 
multiple sources of air emissions are in close proximity . 
Thank you for your consideration in allowing this testimony. l’m joined here today by 
members of the Bureau of Air Quality technical staff, and together we would be happy to 
answer any questions that you might have.
