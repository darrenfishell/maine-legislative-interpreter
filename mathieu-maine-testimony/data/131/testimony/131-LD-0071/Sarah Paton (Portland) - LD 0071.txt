RE: TESTIMONY FOR SUPPORT OF LD 71
Dear Members of the Committee on Environmental and Natural Resources,
I’m writing to state my concern as a Naturopathic Doctor living in Portland, across the 
water from the Global Oil tanks. The noxious fumes that are present in my neighborhood 
and even more strongly in South Portland are a well-established danger to human health. 
We know that these chemicals are implicated in diseases such as cancer, auto-immune 
and neurological conditions among others, and allowing their continued release is a clear 
public health risk.
I am urging you to stand up to corporate interests and act in a morally upright way by 
demanding that the tanks be physically monitored for emissions, as opposed to 
acquescing to some arbitrary calculated emission levels. 
Let’s get clear on what is coming out of those tanks and protect the citizens who live 
beneath and around them.
Thank you,
Dr. Sarah Paton
Past President, Maine Association of Naturopathic Doctors
