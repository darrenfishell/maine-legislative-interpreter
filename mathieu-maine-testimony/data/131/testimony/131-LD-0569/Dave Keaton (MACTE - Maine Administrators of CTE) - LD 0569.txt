TESTIMONY REGARDING
LD 569
An Act to Allow the Adjutant General to Sell the Houlton Armory
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans & Legal 
Affairs Committee. I am Dave Keaton, Executive Director of Maine Administrators of 
Career & Technical Education, testifying on behalf of the CTE Directors of the Maine 
Administrators of Career & Technical Education (MACTE). MACTE would like to 
address LD 569 as we are in support of this bill.
This bill would allow the Adjutant General to Sell the Houlton Armory. 
CTE Directors support the Adjutant General to Sell the Houlton Armory as stated in 
LD 569. We are also in support of Region Two School of Applied Technology obtaining 
this armory for Career & Technical Education training for CTE students as this armory 
is in very close proximity to Region Two School. We also have the following points of 
support for LD 569:
Acquiring the Houlton Armory would enable Region Two to facilitate CTE 
programs in this armory and possibly expand new programs. Region Two’s 
current location has no additional room for expansion.
Acquiring the Houlton Armory to consolidate satellite programs to the Houlton 
location which would decrease transportation of some sending high schools 
and increase the access to more high school students.
Acquiring the Houlton Armory would transfer the mission, of this defensed 
based facility, to an economic development training facility.
We look forward to discussing this matter with all of you in future work sessions.
Yours in education,
Dave Keaton
Dave Keaton, MACTE Executive Director
