LD 569 “An Act to Allow the Adjutant General to Sell the Houlton Armory” 
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
February 27, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and honorable members of the Veterans and Legal 
Affairs Committee, I am Scott Young, Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Defense, 
Veterans and Emergency Management. I am here today to testify in support of LD 569, An Act 
to Allow the Adjutant General to Sell the Houlton Armory. 
As you are aware, the Adjutant General may sell real property of the Military Bureau for its 
appraised value if approval has been obtained from the Legislature. We understand this bill 
intends to add the Houlton Armory to the list of properties for Which the Adjutant General may 
sell. As there are only the standard conditions established in this bill, we support its passage. 
Currently the Houlton Armory is “winterized ” and unoccupied. We are using it for some 
miscellaneous storage. Since we do not have any plans to locate any Lmits at the armory, it is 
likely We will pursue sale, lease or disposal of the property in the near future. 
Thank you for your time and I am happy to address any questions you may have.
