Re: LD 1615, An Act Regarding Limits on Medication in Vending Machines 
 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services: 
 
I am writing to share information neither for nor against LD 1615, An Act Regarding Limits on 
Medication in Vending Machines, on behalf of the Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation.  
 
This bill proposes to repeal the limitation that no more than 12 different nonprescription drugs may 
be dispensed by any single vending machine.  OPOR takes no position on the number of 
nonprescription drugs that a single vending machine may dispensed providing the machine is able to 
safety accommodate a larger number of items. 
 
Public Law 2019, Chapter 454  was enacted June 21, 2019.  The rule to implement the licensing of 
vending machine outlets was adopted by the Board of Pharmacy on April 6, 2023 and is pending 
final review as to form and legality by the Office of the Attorney General.  If this bill is enacted, it 
will require an adjustment to those rules related to the current statutory limitation on the number of 
nonprescription drugs that may be dispensed by a single vending machine.   
 
Thank you for your consideration of our comments and I will be happy to answer any questions at 
the work session.      
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jeri Betts
