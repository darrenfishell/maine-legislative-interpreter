Technology  Testimony LINDA P HASKELL GARLAND, MAINE in support of this
Act  
I am in support of this Act which would prevent events and controversies such as the 
November 2020 Federal Election cheating. The wording could be more straight 
forward. There must be  transparency in all of our governmental processes and 
offices.
