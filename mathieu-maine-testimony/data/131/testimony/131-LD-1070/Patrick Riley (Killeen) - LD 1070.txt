I Patrick Lee Riley of the State of  Texas have as CEO of Reaper Financial LLC, a 
Texas-based Business conducted 32 Blockchain Votes with absolute accuracy, 
transparency, and auditability between January 2022 and the present date. I am an 
expert on the technologies, capabilities, social and cost saving benefits of integrating 
blockchain technologies with or in order to replace legacy technology systems. I am 
personally designing additional tools with which to empower cities, counties, and 
states with the ability to save costs while improving infrastructure. I have not read the 
specific proposal to Maine, but having been invited to testify I will provide a view of 
what can be done when the technology is responsibly deployed.
