Following the child maltreatment related deaths of multiple Maine children in Summer 202-1,;the Office. 
of Child and Family Services: (OCFS) engaged Casey Family Programs and,Co||aborative Safetyito conduct 
a review of several cases and make recommendations for system improvement. One of.those . 
, @ » 
~, 
recommendationsl was "that OCFS establish joint protocol agreements between Law Enforcement, 
Hospitals and Child Welfare staffrwhen there is suspected abuse or neglect to support communication 
and coordination." This prompted the development of a small workgroup including representatives from 
the Maine HospitalAssociation, the Maine State Police, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of 
Child and Family Services,,and myself. The grouphas met monthly since Fall 2021 and through .. 
discussion of both historicaland ongoing challenges with information sharing and.interaction among4

hospitals, law enforcement (LE), and OCFS; it became clear that a joint protocollagreement would be '-fr '-

statutory change and the proposed legislationin LD 474 is the culmination of that work- . 1 -~

Through my work at NL-EMMC, I have some degree of involvement in nearly all hospital admissions with 
concern for potential child maltreatment. Tl'his~experience, inladclition to my-work with the Panel since‘ 
2008, has shown repeatedly and consistently that the bestchild safety outcomes (by which-I mean both- 
the proper identiﬁcationand exclusion of child maltreatment) result from the concurrent and. 
g T: 
collaborative work of multidisciplinary, multiagency teams. Specifically, this includes the medical team,» 
LE, and OCFS. The importance of both LE and OCFS staff having direct access to the relevant medical 
information in a suspected maltreatment case cannot be overstated. OCFS is charged (in part) with 
investigating whether child maltreatment has occurred and determining what protective actions, if any,

are appropriate. Concurrently, LE is charged (in part) with investigating whether a child has beena 
victim of a crime. Both parties require direct acce' ss to relevant medical information to accomplish these 
tasks effectively and efficiently. , T-;T 
The statute is presently clear as to the provision of medical information to OCFS in the context ofa 
mandated report and participation in a related child protection investigation. It is not clear as to the 
provision of the same information to LE, and this ‘results in multiple, undesirable impacts. LE may have 
to receive medical information from OCFS" staff, which is problematic both because it relies on the non- 
medically trained OCFS worker to accurately translate what they heard from a medical professional and 
because the OCFS worker will be unable to reliably provide medically accurate answers to questions the 
LE staff may have. Potentially inaccurate information could inform potentially inappropriate LE 
investigation decisions and strategies early inla case. Additionally, LE's ability to conduct timely, 
efficient, and ultimately effective investigations \/aries significantly around the state, since the 
practice/procedure of healthcare entities, absent statutory clarification, is different. 
One concern with the proposed legislation is that it could create or be perceived as creating a 
disincentive -to those seeking healthcare for themselves or their children. In response to such a concern, 
I would note that this legislation does not actually change the information LE receives. Rather, it changes 
the timing, method, and accuracy of the information they receive and establishes an explicit, statutory 
duty for the medical community to provide that information, in the limited context of a child 
maltreatment investigation and upon LE request. This legislation does not authorize" the disclosure of- 
protected healthcare information (PHI) to LE outside a mandated reporting situation and it does not 
create an additional duty to proactively reportto LE. ' " * i i it " i 
-ii 
While this legislation certainly benefits LE (by enhancing their ability to conduct timely, efficient, and 
effective investigations of potential child maltreatment) and OCFS (by no longer needing to be an 
intermediary between the medical system and LE), the ultimate beneficiary of the proposed legislation 
is Maine's children. Both those who have been victims of child maltreatment and those who ultimately 
will be determined to have not will be afforded a timely, multidisciplinary, investigatory response. 
Children who have been victimized will benefit from a system that more effectively protects them and 
holds accountable the person/persons responsible for their maltreatment. Thosewho have not, as well 
as their families, will benefit from a prompter investigatory determination, thereby minimizing, to the 
extent possible, their involvement with LE. The statutory changes proposed in LD 474 will undoubtedly 
improve the functioning of this aspect of the broad child welfare system. 
A scheduling conflict prevents me from being able to deliver this testimony in person, though I will make 
every effort to be present for the work session, should that be helpful to the Committee. I am also 
happy to speak with any of the Committee members further, upon request. Thank you for the 
opportunity to provide this testimony in support of LD 474. r'
