Testimony of Lt. Col.  Brian P. Scott
131st First Regular Session 
IN SUPPORT OF LD 474 AN ACT TO IMPROVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN MANDATORY 
REPORTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED CHILD ABUSE 
AND NEGLECT  
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services, my name is Lt. Col. Brian P. Scott and 
I am here today to testify on behalf of the Maine State Police and the Department 
of Public Safety in Support of LD 474 AN ACT TO IMPROVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN 
MANDATORY REPORTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED 
CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT.
Our Staff Attorney, Paul Cavanaugh and State Police Captain Jeff Love both 
participated in a group that was chaired by the DHHS seeking input on how those 
of us committed to protecting our children could better work together to ensure 
greater successes in the investigation of child abuse and neglect cases.  This bill 
attempts to remove one of the barriers identified by this group by requiring a staff 
member of a medical institution to provide the same information that a mandatory 
reporter provided to DHHS regarding suspected abuse or neglect of a child to a 
law enforcement officer upon their request. 
Our officers often struggle to get the necessary information from hospitals to 
conduct a proper investigation of a child abuse complaint, due to the current 
statute that only allows the hospital staff to provide the information to DHHS and 
the District Attorney’s Office.  This is a significant problem when the District 
Attorney’s Offices are closed on nights, weekends and holidays and we have no 
way to get the necessary information to begin the important work of doing a time 
sensitive and thorough investigation.  This bill will allow officers to gather 
pertinent information in a much more expeditious manner improving the chances

actions.  
For this reason, I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 474.
On behalf of the Department of Public Safety and the Maine State Police, I thank 
you for your time and would be happy to try and answer any questions that you 
might have.
