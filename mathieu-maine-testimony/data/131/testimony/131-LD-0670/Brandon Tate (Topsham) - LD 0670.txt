I would like to express support for the "Act to Protect Birds and Wildlife in the 
Construction and Maintenance of Public Buildings" (LD 670) currently under 
consideration in the Maine state legislature. As a Maine resident and Professor of 
Environmental Studies at Bowdoin College, I believe we have a moral obligation to 
adopt the most up-to-date and well-informed principles of sustainable development as
we plan for the growth of communities throughout the state, in order to ensure the 
preservation of healthy ecosystems and safe habitat for our treasured wildlife. This 
bill would help to achieve that goal by promoting bird-safe design in public buildings.
I am particularly interested in this bill as it relates to the work of BirdSafe Bowdoin, a
grassroots initiative involving students, faculty, and staff at Bowdoin College to 
promote bird-safe architecture, which was inspired by a similar initiative in the city of
Portland organized by Maine Audubon. Beginning in Spring 2022, BirdSafe Bowdoin
volunteers conducted systematic window strike surveys on the Bowdoin campus to 
identify buildings that pose a hazard for migratory and resident birds. In response to 
the results of the campus-wide study, the Bowdoin College Office of Sustainability is 
currently cooperating with Maine Audubon and the Portland Society for Architecture 
to integrate bird-safe measures such as etched glass windows into the college's 
building standards for new construction, and we are considering retrofits for existing 
buildings that were found to be contributing to bird casualties.
Our hope is that Bowdoin College will not only reduce the frequency of deadly 
window strikes on its campus but will also help establish a precedent for bird-friendly
construction initiatives and help to normalize architectural features such as etched 
glass. We believe that the State of Maine can also take a leadership role in mitigating 
the impact on the vulnerable wildlife that live in and pass through our state by passing
this bill, which would promote bird-safe design in public buildings throughout the 
state.
I urge you to pass the "Act to Protect Birds and Wildlife in the Construction and Maintenance 
of Public Buildings" and help to ensure that Maine is doing its part to protect our precious 
wildlife.
