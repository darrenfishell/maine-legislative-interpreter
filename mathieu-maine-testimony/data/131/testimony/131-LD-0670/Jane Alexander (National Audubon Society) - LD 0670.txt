LD 670
Dear legislators, I write to you today on the crucial issue of bird strikes on windows. My work 
with National Audubon, BirdsCanada and BirdLifeInternational the past fifty years has taught 
me that other than predation by cats and habitat loss there is nothing globally more 
destructive to birds than collisions with buildings, particularly glass. 
 Making our cities bird friendly is vital to keeping birds with us in the years to come. Healthy 
birds mean a healthy environment for all living things. They truly are the canaries in the coal 
mine. 
 Let Maine be another state to lead in this arena. Please pass LD670
