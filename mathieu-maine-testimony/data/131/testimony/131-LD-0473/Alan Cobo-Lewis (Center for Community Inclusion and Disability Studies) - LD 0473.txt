Re: Testimony FOR LD 473 “ Resolve, to Expand the Eligibility for and Increase the Number of Hours of Applied 
Behavior Analysis Services Authorized by the MaineCare Program ” 
Chairman Baldacci, Chairwoman Meyer, and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
and Human Services:  
My name is Alan Cobo -Lewis. I live in Orono. I am director of the Center for Community Inclusion and Disability 
Studies (CCIDS) at the University of Maine.  I am also the parents of two 22 -year -olds, one of whom has autism 
and who has benefi tted from applied behavior analysis (ABA).  
CCIDS is Maine’s federally funded University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD, 
pronounced “YOU -said”), authorized by the federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights A ct 
of 2000 (“DD Act”). The purpose of the national network of UCEDDs is to provide leadership in advise federal 
state and community policy leaders about, and promote opportunities for individuals with developmental 
disabilities to exercise self -determinati on, be independent, be productive, and be integrated and included in all 
facets of community life. Part of the federal mandate of CCIDS is to educate and advise policymakers, including 
members of the state legislature. Consistent with CCIDS responsibilitie s under the DD Act and consistent with 
University of Maine Board of Trustees policies 212 and 214, I am submitting material pertaining to LD 473 for 
myself and for CCIDS, not for the University of Maine or the University of Maine System as a whole.  
1 Existing behavioral support ext remely limited in Section 21, absent from 
Section 29  
As I have previously brought to this Committee’s attention, the Legislature directed the Department back in 
2009 years to include services by Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) in Section 21 and S ection 29 
(Resolve 2009 chapter 33 ) to oversee ABA programming . The Department added this as a consultation service to 
Section 21 in 201 41, but limited it to only 16.5 hours per year, at the same level as it limited other consultation 
services. And it has not added this service to Section 29.  
2 ABA in adulthood  
Private health insurance in all 50 states covers ABA  to address behavio ral challenges in people with autism, and 
insurance companies in Maine generally recognize that because of mental health parity requirements, they do 
 
1 Contrast the rule at 
https://web.archive.org/web/20130702094555/http://maine.gov/sos/cec/rules/10/144/ch101/c3s021.doc  (which still  
lacked behavior consultation) with the rule at 
https://web.archive.org/web/20140928102406/http://maine.gov/sos/cec/rules/10/144/ch101/c3s021.d ocx (which finally 
covered behavior consultation)  
2 so without age limit2—which is fortunate, because while most work in the area has focused on children, th ere is 
also evidence for the effectiveness of ABA for adolescents and adults3. 
But most people on the Section 21 and 29 waivers don’t have private health insurance, so don’t have access to 
this service.  
3 Clarity on what the bill is requiring  
Typically  private health insurance coverage includes evaluation, treatment design, and supervision of behavioral 
technicians by a BCBA at a ratio of about 5:1 (5 hours behavior technician to 1 hour of masters - or doctoral -level 
BCBA support and supervision)4. 
3.1 120 hours/year of BCBA oversight? ☺ 
If the bill is requiring reimbursement for up to 120 hours/year of BCBA oversight then that would correspond to 
about 11.5 hours/week of contact with a behavioral technician.  
If direct support professionals are implementing the program essentially in the role of behavioral technician 
then 120 hours/year of BCBA oversight seems modest —but a vast improvement over the current limit of 16.5.  
3.2 120 hours/year of just behavior technician support?  
If, on the other hand, the bill is directing the Department to cover up to 120 hours/year of behavioral technician 
support then, at the 5:1 ratio from private health insurance, that would correspond to only 24 hours/year of 
BCBA oversight —far too low for anything but the most modest treatme nt program.  
4 Improvements to the bill  
4.1 120 hours/year of BCBA oversight  
I therefore suggest that the bill be amended to clarify that it is requiring coverage for up to 120 hours/year of 
BCBA support.  
4.2 Scope of BCBA activities  
I further suggest that the bill be amended to clarify that th e BCBA support may include evaluation and program 
design as well as direct case supervision (with the client present) and indirect case supervision (without the 
client present) . These would be important improvements to ensure th at people with disabilities receiving 
Section 21 or 29 support get behavioral support designed to have some fidelity to treatment model.
