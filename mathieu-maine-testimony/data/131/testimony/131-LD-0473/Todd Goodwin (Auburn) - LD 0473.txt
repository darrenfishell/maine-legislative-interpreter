 
 Testimony of Todd Goodwin, CEO, John F. Murphy Homes, Inc. 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services  
Testifying In Support Of 
L.D. 473, Resolve, to Expand the Eligibility for and Increase the Number of Hours of Applied 
Behavior Analysis Services Authorized by the MaineCare Program   
March 29, 2023 
 
 Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services, my name is Todd Goodwin. I serve as CEO of John F. Murphy 
Homes, Inc., a provider of disability services based in Auburn, Maine. We serve both children 
and adults.  
  
 I am testifying in support of L.D. 473, Resolve, to Expand the Eligibility for and Increase 
the Number of Hours of Applied Behavior Analysis Services Authorized by the MaineCare 
Program.   
  
 I have two thoughts to share in support of this bill. 
 
 First, I completely agree with the testimony put forth by the Association for Maine 
Behavior Analysis (AMeBA). We are proud to employ several members of this professional 
association. They do incredible work in the face of challenging behavior. 
 
 Second, my agency operates seven special purpose private schools under the Margaret 
Murphy Centers for Children name. We provide educational and treatment services to students 
from pre-K through grade 12 in partnership with 40+ public school districts across our state.  
 
 Applied behavior analysis is a critical clinical modality in our overall treatment approach. 
I stand in awe at its effectiveness in creating positive change across a range of populations and 
types of problematic behavior. When done right, it simply works.  
 
 Adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities are just as deserving of effective 
treatment interventions as are available in the childrenâ€™s service system. It is an issue of parity 
and moral obligation. 
 
  
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 Todd Goodwin
