LD 473
I am entering testimony in support of the passage of LD473. In 1999 the United States
Surgeon General concluded "Thirty years of research demonstrated the efficacy of 
applied behavioral methods in reducing inappropriate behavior and increasing 
communication, learning and appropriate social behavior.*  This statement was made 
in 1999. Twenty-four years have passed since this statement/report was released to the
American Public. The above statement has been augmented with years of scientific 
research since 1999 proving it is an effective agent of behavioral change.
From a personal perspective I have worked with adults, adolescents and children 
through out New England over the past 30 years. ABA is a key component to 
behavioral change in all aspects of my work. It is important that ABA interventions 
need to be supervised by qualified behavior analysts. It is not treatment that can be 
properly put into place without clinical oversight. ABA from skilled certified  
professionals changes inappropriate behaviors in adults and children. This improves 
the individuals ability to freely function in society. It is widely available and funded 
in the rest of New England as a treatment of choice with the with autistic individuals 
and other hard to treat behaviors. The State of Maine is falling behind in one of the 
most useful evidenced based treatment being used today. WHY?
