LD 473
To Whom it May Concern:
I am a professional member of the Association for Maine Behavior Analysis 
(AMeBA) and its Public Policy committee. As such, I am aware that AMeBA has 
submitted written testimony supporting LD 473 and requesting that the bill be 
amended to include the full scope of applied behavior analysis (ABA) services for 
adults with intellectual disabilities and autism. I am writing in support of AMeBA's 
testimony and to echo the sentiments reflected in the statement. I would be happy to 
answer any questions or to further discuss the specific request that LD 473 be 
amended to explicitly authorize 120 hours annually of the full scope of ABA services 
for this population. I may be reached at: neboivin@gmail.com. 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Nicole E. Boivin, Ph.D., BCBA-D, CCC-SLP
