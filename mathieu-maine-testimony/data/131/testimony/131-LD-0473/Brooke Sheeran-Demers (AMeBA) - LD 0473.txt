LD 473
 Hello, 
     I am writing in to support AMeBA's testimony on LD 473 and am available to 
discuss the specific request to amend the bill to authorize the full scope of ABA 
services for adults with intellectual disabilities and autism. Not only is expanding 
ABA vital to effective treatment access for adults with intellectual disabilities and 
autism, it is vital to their families, caregivers, and society at large. Effective and 
trauma informed ABA increases an individual's ability to function independently and 
happily in their community and provide them with the best quality of life. A large part
of effective treatment is appropriate frequency and supervision of services by a 
qualified and trained professional. It is my hope that this bill expansion will assist 
with this. Thank you for your time in reading this testimony.
Best Regards,
Brooke Sheeran-Demers, M.S.Ed., BCBA
