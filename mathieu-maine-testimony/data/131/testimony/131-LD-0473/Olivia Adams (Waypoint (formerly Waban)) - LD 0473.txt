Senator Baldacci, Representation Mey er and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee, I am writing in support of  LD473: Resolve, to Expand the Eligibility for and Increase the 
Number of  Hours of Applied Behavior Analysis Services Authorized by the  MaineCare Program . 
  
I have been the Adult Services Board  Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) for Waypoint (formally 
Waban) for 7½ years  and have witnessed the negative impacts that the current service limits impose  
for these individuals and their caregivers.  
While children  in Maine access individualized behavioral consultation services in the school 
and community settings , once they move into adulthood , their access to this vital service is 
significantly limited.  Mai neCare rule section 21.07-6 restricts the amount of service to 16.5 hours 
per year , regardless of the level of need or severity of the behavioral challenges.  The State’s 
mandatory requirement s for addressing challenging behavior generate a substantial amount of 
requisite  work  that must be completed by the behavior consultant. These include, but are not 
limited to; twice annual in -person meetings with the individual receiving services, intervie wing all 
invested parties, a full record -review, developing a Functional Assessment (which identifies 
variables that  lead  the individual to engage in challenging behavior), developing a method by 
which the caregivers  will collect data, collecting, monitoring, and analyzing behavior data on an 
ongoing basis, creating a psychotropic medication treatment plan,  all which ultimately lead to the 
develop ment of  a Positive Support Plan (individualized proactive interventions to address/avoid 
challenging behaviors) .  
Not only do these requirements exceed the allotted 16.5 hours per year, but there is also  a 
significant need for ongoing training and cons ultation with the  caregivers , particularly in light of 
the high turnover we experience in this field , as well as to address evolving needs of the individual 
being served.   In some cases, extreme chal lenging and dangerous behaviors require the 
development of a more intrusive Behavior Management Plan (BMP).  Maine requires a stringent approval and monitoring policy for BMPs, including quarterly meetings with DHHS, monthly monitoring of data, and monthly  team meetings. Each step requires careful consideration as it is

unique to each individual , and also clearly  exceeds the annual limit in service hours.  
These requirements are critical and are supported; they help ensure a high -quality service  in 
the best interests of  individuals with disabilities. However, they require additional service limits 
within the existing MaineCare rule. LD 473 resolves to increase the maximum number of service 
hours per year to  120. This would allow for the provision of complete, quality, ongoing behavioral 
consultation and help  improv e the safety , independence, and quality of life for  adults with 
intellectual/developmental disabilities.
