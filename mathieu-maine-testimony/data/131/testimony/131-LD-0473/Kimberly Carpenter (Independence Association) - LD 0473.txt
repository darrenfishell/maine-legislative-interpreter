Subject:   LD 473 Resolve, to Expand the Eligibility for and Increase the  
Number of Hours of Applied Behavior Analysis Services Authorized by 
the MaineCare Program 
 
Date:   March 29, 2023 
 
Hello, my name is Kim Carpenter.  I am the Director of Finance at Independence 
Association in Brunswick. We are a non-profit organization that has supported 
people with Intellectual Disabilities since 1966.  I am submitting written 
testimony supporting RE: LD 473: Resolve, to Expand the Eligibility for and 
Increase the Number of Hours of Applied Behavior Analysis Services Authorized 
by the MaineCare Program.   
 
Under section 28, children with IDD or Autism with complex behavioral needs, 
receive ABA services in preschool until the age of 18.  Children are eligible to 
receive a minimum of 120 hours and up to 136 hours if necessary.  Once these 
children enter young adulthood the availability of these services is greatly 
diminished to only 16.5 hours per year.  This cut in services to too drastic, 
especially at a time when someone is transitioning in to a new phase of their life.  
In addition, these services are vital throughout an individuals life to help maintain 
good behaviors and quality of life.  I’m requesting that ABA hours for adults be 
amended to reflect a minimum of 120 per year and be extended to individuals on 
Section 29. 
 
Increasing ABA hours for adults with IDD or Autism with complex behavioral 
needs is also less costly in the long run.  Behavior support plans are proven to be 
effective.  As clients learn to overcome their behavioral challenges, fewer staffing 
hours needed to support them and keep them safe.

Unfortunately, many times, due to staffing shortages, agencies are forced to terminate services for 
adults with IDD or Autism.  This can lead to clients being left in emergency rooms.  Agencies are 
also reluctant to take on clients with greater behavioral needs for the same reasons.   
 
By continuing ABA services at the same level through a person’s life, we can offer them a more 
productive and greater quality of life along with a cost savings to MaineCare. 
 
Thank you.
