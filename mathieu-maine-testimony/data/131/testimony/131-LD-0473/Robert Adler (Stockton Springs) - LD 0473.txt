Dear members of the committee,
I am writing in favor of this bill. Adults with IDD and autism deserve to have same 
access to ABA as those under 21. This bill would ensure enough hours of service so 
that the treatment will be effective. I also support amending the bill to make clear that 
these services include functional assessment. Functional assessment is an essential 
tool in ABA. 
Thank you
