Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyers and distinguished members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services
Adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities or autism with complex
behavioral needs face significant barriers when it comes to ABA services.  Currently, 
MaineCare limits the type and hours of ABA services (Section 21 - 16.5 hrs) or does 
not cover ABA (Section 29 - 0 hrs), preventing individuals from receiving effective 
treatment, which causes poor quality of life, limited community access, and 
over-utilization of emergency departments, crisis resources and provider capacity.
However, Section 28 provides the full range of services needed for effective treatment
to children. When they enter the adult system, those who rely on ABA essentially fall 
off a treatment cliff. Adults need parity in their services.
Section 28 allowable ABA services (139 total hours) - Section 21 current allowable 
(16.5 total) Section 29 (0 total)
Section 28 allowed to Conduct Functional Behavioral Assessment - Section 21 and 29
not allowed.
Section 28 allowed to Conduct evidence based practices - Section 21 and 29 not 
allowed.
Section 28 allowed to Coordinate care with other providers - Section 21 and 29 not 
allowed.
Section 28 allowed to Conduct treatment team meetings - Section 21 and 29 not 
allowed.
We are asking that Adult Services continue to receive the same ABA services and 
hours that they received in children services.  ABA is a distinct and essential practice 
for positive long term outcomes throughout a persons whole life.
Thank you for your consideration.  Terri Cross, Independence Association
