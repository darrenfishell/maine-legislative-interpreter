Re: LD 473 â€“ Resolve, to Expand the Eligibility for and Increase the Number of Hours of 
Applied Behavior Analysis Services Authorized by the MaineCare Program  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide information neither for nor against LD 473, Resolve, to Expand the 
Eligibility for and Increase the Number of Hours of Applied Behavior Analysis Services 
Authorized by the MaineCare Program . 
 
This bill proposes the maximum number of reimbursable hours for  applied behavior analysis 
(ABA)  service s for adults with Intellectual Disabilities or Autism Spectrum Disorder  be 
increased to 120 hours  under Ch. III, Sections 21 and 29 of the MaineCare benefits manual.  
 
ABA services are currently billable under Sec 21 only under the general Behavioral Consult code 
(G9007 HI) subject to a 16.5 hour annual limit per policy.  The Office of Aging and Disabil ity 
Services does not currently receive specific requests for ABA services; requests are made in 
general for consultation services to assist with supporting individuals who require additional 
behavioral health supports or analysis.  
 
As written, this bill targets and request s expansion of one type of treatment (ABA) ; more data is 
needed to determine if this expansion is necessary to meet the needs of waiver participants . 
System changes , Section 21 and 29 rulemakings , and 1915(c) waiver amendments  would be 
required  to add the new covered service.  
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director  
MaineCare Services
