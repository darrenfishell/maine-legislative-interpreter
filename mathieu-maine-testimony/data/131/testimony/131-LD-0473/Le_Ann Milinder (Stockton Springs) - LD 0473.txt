LD473 - Information on the Efficacy of ABA for Persons with Intellectual and Developmental 
Disabilities 
 
Applied Behavior Analysis is an effective intervention for reducing unwanted behavior and teaching new 
skills.  Decades of scholarly publications report successful outcomes for people with autism spectrum 
disorders as well as people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  
 
These interventions can reduce the restrictive practices that are often used to manage dangerous 
behavior in the absence of effective treatment. They also can be used to help individuals develop a wide 
repertoire of functional skills, including communication, social skills, everyday tasks, and vocational skills.  
 
Research in recent years has shown that positive approaches based in ABA can be implemented 
consistent with a person-centered approach that meets the requirements of the HCBS settings where the 
services described in LD473 occur.
