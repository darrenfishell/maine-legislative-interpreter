Testimony of Senator Joe Rafferty in Support of
LD 232, An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Bonding Restrictions for School Administrative Units
Before the Senate Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs
Thursday, February 9, 2023
Good afternoon Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Committee on Education and 
Cultural Affairs. My name is Joe Rafferty and I proudly represent the people of Senate District 34 
including Berwick, North Berwick, Wells, Kennebunk and Kennebunkport. 
I am here today to speak in support of LD 232 An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Bonding 
Restrictions for School Administrative Units. This matter was first brought to my attention while 
attending a local Select Board Meeting in North Berwick last year. It was actually a suggestion made by 
Town Manager, Dwayne Morin.
The bill extends the allowed terms of bonds issued to school administrative districts and regional school 
units from 25 years to 30 years. I believe the impact may allow communities additional payment options 
when considering such matters.
Iâ€™ll do my best to answer any questions I can but expect there are folks in the room with far more 
experience than I related to this matter.
Thank you for your time.
Joe Rafferty
Senate District 34
