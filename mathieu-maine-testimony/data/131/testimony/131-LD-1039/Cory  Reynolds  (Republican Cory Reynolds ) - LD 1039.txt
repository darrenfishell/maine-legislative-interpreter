LD 1039
Senator Beebee-center, Representative Salisbury, and esteemed members of the joint 
standing committee on criminal justice and public safety-
My name is 
Cory Reynolds. I come before you today to support LD 1039, an act to provide 
restitution for victims of shoplifting for time spent dealing with the oflense. I believe 
that actions have consequences and if you do the crime, you should do the time. Here 
is an example, a Democrat Representative is an owner of a small business store, and 
someone comes in and steals something, would that Democrat owner of the store be 
ok with someone stealing from the 
store? probably not so I ask you to vote and support on LD-1039.
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
