Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and the distinguished members 
of the Committee on Health and Human Services: 
My name is Rep. Michael Lemelin of House District 53: Chelsea, 
Randolph, Pittston, and Dresden. I am here to present LD 820, 
”Resolve, to Provide Support for an Early Intervention and Preschool 
Child Care Services Program in Kennebec County." 
Everyone here understands that we are in need of Early Childhood 
Intervention, especially for children with special needs. The earlier we 
help parents and the children for further education the better. At ﬁrst 
glance this may seem like it is a band aid, however, instead we should 
look at this as a great ﬁrst move towards solving our early intervention 
and education issues. 
I believe we have an obligation to invest in this area if we have people 
willing to take on the challenge. From this model, I believe we can 
expand to cover all the needs in the near future. I have a person here 
who has the qualiﬁcations to offer a proposal to accomplish this goal. 
For this reason, I have brought forward this bill. 
Thank you for this opportunity.
