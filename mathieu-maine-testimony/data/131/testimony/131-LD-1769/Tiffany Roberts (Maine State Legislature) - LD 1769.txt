Testimony of Rep. T ijfany Roberts presenting 
LD 1769, An Act Concerning Students Who Experience Educational Disruption Due to 
Temporary or Permanent Changes Where They Live 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
Good afternoon, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. My name is Tiffany Roberts and I represent House 
District 149 and the communities of North B€I‘WlCl{ and South Berwick. I am here before you 
today to present LD 1769, An Act Concerning Students Who Experience Educational 
Disruption Due to Temporary or Permanent Changes Where They Live. 
In the 130th Legislature, one of my school districts approached me with concems about truancy 
rates in their district. Upon looking into their request, it became apparent that this was a broader 
issue across the state. I determined that more data was needed to adequately understand the scope 
of the problem. The study I submitted that session Was folded into the Truancy, Dropout and 
Alternative Education Advisory Committee research, bringing us here. This bill is one of two 
bills I will present to the committee as a result of research done by the TDAE Advisory 
Committee. It seeks to re-establish a program that previously existed under the Children ’s 
Cabinet in a past administration and put it into statute. 
Presently, highly mobile students are falling through the cracks. To address this issue, LD 1769 
establishes a position within and overseen by the Department of Education called the Keeping 
Maine Children ’s Comiected Program Manager. This position would support Maine kids who 
experience educational disruptions so that students can maintain educational stability, complete 
their educational program, access needed community support and attain a high school diploma 
with the needed skills to pursue post-secondary opportunities. 
These students experience disruptions in their educational programs due to inpatient psychiatric 
placement, foster care placement, kinship care placement, correctional-facility placement and/or 
high mobility due to economic instability. Youth in transition are often involved with multiple 
systems, yet the individual Departments, agencies, schools and hospitals too frequently work in 
isolation. 
District 149: Part of North Berwick and Part of South Bervvick
The Keeping Maine’s Children Connected Manager will establish and maintain a liaison network 
across relevant Maine agencies and school districts. These agencies include but are not limited to 
school administrative units, each regional State of Maine agency ofﬁce, juvenile correctional 
facilities, inpatient psychiatric hospitals and mental health crisis stabilization units. The manager 
will also be responsible for providing regional and statewide professional development and 
technical assistance support to the ﬁeld so students have access to the services and learning 
opportunities they need to be successful. In addition, the manager will work with other state 
agencies to align policies and practices to increase student educational attaimnent. 
I have an Assistant Superintendent in one of my school districts who sewed in this capacity 
when the program was in operation. She relayed in our conversations that she found this program 
instrumental to effectively and efficiently access services and supports for students who 
experienced educational disruption. 
This bill will re-establish a statewide comprehensive communication network of Keeping 
Maine’s Children Connected Liaisons to connect existing schools, state agencies and community 
supports in place for Maine students. The Keeping Maine’s Children Connected Program 
Manager will institute a low-budget, high-impact network that connects existing key staff who 
can provide support and resources that will beneﬁt kids and their families, leading to better 
student leaming and health outcomes. 
This position will support the State’s most vulnerable population of students. 
Thank you for your consideration, and I would be happy to answer any questions but would 
defer to those more knowledgeable coming after me.

ri Notable Trends 
0 Chronic Absenteeism - Data from 2020 and 2021 shows an increase in Chronic 
Absenteeism (missing more than 10% enroiled days) of 25% from 2019. 
o Truancy Rate - Data from 2021 shows an increase in Truancy of 117% from 2019. 
(2020 data, 40% decrease, likely skewed due to remote learning statewide) 
0 Impact on Graduation Rates - 2021 Graduation rates did not significantly change, 
however, the above data would be considered leading indicators, so impact 
should be noted in 2022 and 2023 graduation rates.
