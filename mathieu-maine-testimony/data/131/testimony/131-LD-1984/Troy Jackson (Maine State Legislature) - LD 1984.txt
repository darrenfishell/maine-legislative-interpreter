Testimony in Support of LD 1984 
“An Act to Allow Golf Courses to Obtain a License to Conduct Off-premises Catering ” 
Presented to the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
May 24, 2023 
Good moming Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. My name is Troy Jackson and I have the 
honor of serving as Senate President representing the good people of Aroostook County in the 
Maine Legislature. I’m here today to introduce LD 1984, “An Act to Allow Golf Courses to 
Obtain a License to Conduct Off-premises Catering ” 
The bill before you today is an effort to recognize the challenge of Golf Courses or clubs that 
serve people in small communities not just as a golf course, but as a commercial kitchen. The 
challenge faced by these clubs was brought to my attention by Reuben Caron of Portage Hills 
Country Club. Portage Hills is located in Portage Lake, which has a population under 400. For 
this club’s kitchen and restaurant to successfully meet the requirements currently in Title 28-A 
for food sales to gain a Class A license, and therefore become eligible for an off-premise catering 
license, is almost impossible for a place like Portage Hills. 
This draft of a bill is an attempt to remedy the mismatch of Portage Hill’s role in the seasonal 
economy in my district and the sale of food requirements for an off-premise catering license. I 
know that this session, Rep. Supica has already worked on a bill that would make ClassA 
licenses more accessible, but my hope is that the Committee can assist with moving this bill 
forward in a way that speciﬁcally recognizes the challenges of restaurants in very small, rural 
communities. To achieve this while keeping the scope of the bill reasonable, I suggest an 
amendment that changes “golf courses” to “golf courses already licensed to sell spirits, wind, and 
malt liquor.” 
Thank you for your time today and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.
