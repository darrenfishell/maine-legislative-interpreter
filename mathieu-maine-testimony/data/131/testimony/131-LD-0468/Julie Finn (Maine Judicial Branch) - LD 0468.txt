Judicial Branch testimony in favor of LD 468, An Act Regarding Regional 
Law Libraries:
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony in support of this Judicial Branch bill. 
The usage of law libraries has changed dramatically in the internet age. A great deal of 
information, including Maine statutes, Law Court decisions, and Maine Rules of Court, is 
available online at no cost. Other electronic legal research services, such as Westlaw and Lexis, 
are accessible for a monthly subscription fee. There is currently very little need or demand for 
examination of books and hard copies of other materials. Moreover, if someone needs specific 
information from one of Maineâ€™s law libraries, one need only to email a law librarian who will 
scan and send information by return email.
The purpose of this legislation is to bring the statute in line with the current reality. The 
Judicial Branch maintains law libraries in Portland and Bangor and will continue to do so. It has 
been a number of years since there was a library in every county. While some of these former 
county law libraries may continue to house legal volumes, the books have not been updated for 
many years and are thus of little use to attorneys or the public.
We have been discussing these statutory changes with the staff and boards of the libraries 
in Portland and Bangor and may have some minor amendments to suggest. I will provide any 
changes to your analyst as soon as possible.
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions.
