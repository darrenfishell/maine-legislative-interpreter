21366568_2LD 153, An Act to Allow Electronic Distribution of Certain Documents to Municipalities and 
Electronic Acknowledgment of Receipt of Certain Documents as Acceptable Communications
January 31, 2023
Chair Nangle, Chair Stover, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government, my 
name is Stephen Gorden and in addition to serving as a member of the board of commissioners for Cumberland 
County, I am writing today in my role as chair of the legislative policy committee of the Maine County 
Commissioners Association. We appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony to the Committee in support of 
LD 153.
About MCCA.  Briefly, the Maine County Commissioners Association was established in 1890 to assist 
Maine’s county government in providing vital services to Maine citizens in a responsive, efficient, and credible 
manner. The Association is based in Augusta and currently represents 15 of Maine’s 16 counties and is governed 
by a board with representation from each participating county. 
Discussion.  Maine law currently requires every county in Maine to notify each municipality within the county 
of its proposed or estimated budget. That notice must be by mail.  Under LD 153, counties would also have the 
option to provide such notice by electronic means. We believe adding this option reflects current means of 
communication, creates efficiencies, and will save money. Hence, we believe LD 153 is a positive proposal that 
should be supported.
Conclusion.  We appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony on this bill, and if you have questions or need 
additional information, please do not hesitate to let us know.
Respectfully submitted,
Stephen Gorden
Chair, Legislative Policy Committee
