Testimony of Rep. Jan Dodge presenting 
LD 153, An Act to Allow Electronic Distribution of Certain Documents to Municipalities 
and Electronic Acknowledgement of Receipt of Certain Documents as Acceptable 
Communications 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government 
Good afternoon Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and esteemed members of the State and 
Local Government Committee. My name is Jan Dodge. I represent House District 39 Belfast, 
Northpoit and Belmont. 
I am here today to present LD 153, An Act to Allow Electronic Distribution of Certain 
Documents to Municipalities and Electronic Acknowledgement of Receipt of Certain 
Documents as Acceptable Communications. 
This bill is before you to update MRSA Title 30-A 701 2-c,3 and 855,3 which will help save the 
citizens of the State of Maine money. It is the result of the excellent suggestion by the Town 
Administrator ofNo1thport, James Kossuth, the support of the Waldo County Commissioners 
and input from their most capable County Clerk, Barb Arseneau! 
Currently, huge multi-page documents are required to be sent to municipalities by registered or 
certiﬁed mail and an acknowledgement sent back by registered or certiﬁed mail. This is 
expensive and highly inefﬁcient! State government should be functioning in the 21$‘ Century 
where the use of technology should be not just utilized, but optimized! By passing this bill 
allowing electronic transmission of documents and an email reply stating they have been 
received, towns who opt in will contribute to increased efﬁciencies. 
I appreciate your time and attention! I hope you will support this bill and I look forward to the 
work session. 
Thank you. I Would ask you to direct questions to a person acquainted with the current system of 
document delivery and acknowledgement. 
District 39: Belfast, Belmont & Northport
