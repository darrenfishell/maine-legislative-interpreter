Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, and distinguished members of the State and Local Government 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I am submitting testimony in support for LD 153, An Act 
to Allow Electronic Distribution of Certain Documents to Municipalities and Electronic 
Acknowledgement of Receipt of Certain Documents as Acceptable Communications, on behalf of the 
Maine Municipal Association, which represents the interests of municipal government before the 
Legislature. The positions of the Association are established by our 70-member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC), who are elected by the councils and selectboards of municipalities in each of Maine’s 
35 Senate districts.
Municipal officials have no qualms with broadening the method of communicating between 
counties and the communities that fund them. Electronic communication has become an expected method 
of government and business communication. Officials encourage their county partners to work with their 
municipal communities to determine which method works best for their office needs, available staffing 
and resources.
