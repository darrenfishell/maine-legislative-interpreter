To Whom It May Concern: 
 
My name is Carter light.  I am the owner of Colvard & Company LLC (Colvard Sausages) located 
in Ellsworth.  We are a small CIS licensed, fresh sausage producer under the Maine Meat and 
Poultry Inspection Program.  Currently, FSIS inspectors are on site 4 days a week (Monday 
through Thursday). 
 
I am writing this testimony in support of bill LD 1916.  In the almost 3 years that Colvard 
Sausages has been under inspection there have been multiple occasions when we have not 
been able to produce product due to the lack of an Inspector. This has mostly happened on 
Snow Days, when the Inspectors do not work.   
 
Without an Inspector present, we are not allowed to handle any products.  Our employees 
cannot enter facility and cannot work.  We cannot pay our employees when we are unable to 
produce our products.   
 
Additionally, when production is lost our deliveries are delayed or cancelled.  Limiting our 
production means we cannot produce enough product to supply all our customers.  Sometimes 
we must cancel the deliveries or limit the amount of product we are selling.   
 
Maine state government has identified increased local meat production and processing as being 
strategically important to the economic welfare of the State, and the reliable availability of 
meat inspectors is a significant obstacle to achieving it. I would urge the Legislature to pass LD 
1916.  This bill not only effects our business, but the ability for our workers to make a steady 
living and our customers to receive our products.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.
