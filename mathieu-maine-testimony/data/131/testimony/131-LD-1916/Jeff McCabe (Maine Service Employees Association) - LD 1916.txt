 Tes�mony of Jeﬀ McCabe  
Maine Service Employees Associa�on, SEIU Local 1989  
 
In Opposi�on to LD 1916,  An Act to Classify Meat and Poultry Products Inspec�ons as Essen�al 
Services  
Before the Joint Standing Commitee on Agriculture,  Conserva�on and Forestry.  
May 22, 2023  
 
Senator Ingw ersen, Representa�ve  Pluecker , members of the Commitee on Agriculture,  Conserva�on 
and Forestry , I’m  Jeﬀ McCabe, director of poli�cs and legisla�on for the Maine Service Employees 
Associa�on, Local 1989 of the Service Employees Interna�onal Union. We are a labor union represen�ng 
over 13,000 Maine workers . We are opposed  to LD 1916.  
 
I want to  recognize we understand the intent of this bill and  understand why the sponsor is bringing it 
forward.  We also understand the key support that these state employees provide to Maine businesses. 
This is not the ﬁrst �me this session this issue has been raised  but the Department has also requested 
�me to develop a solu�on.  
 
Our opposi�on today  is due in part as spelled out in the  Department ’s tes�mony ; the administra�on has 
the authority to designate essen�al employees . We also oppose this  bill at this �me  because the 
Department , under the leadership of Commissioner Beal , has commited to working  toward  a solu�on 
to this issue. We think  the Department ’s app roach  is the best approach at this �me because the 
Department clearly wants to invol ve the workers and those who  supervise them in the process  and in 
the planning.  
 Across this commitee’s jurisdic�on , Natural Resource Agencies are struggling to recruit and retain staﬀ. 
Workload and wages are two key issues. We strongly cau�on you to approach issues like this 
strategically. One in six  state posi�ons already are currently vacant  
htps://www.bangordailyn ews.com/2023/03/27/poli�cs/maine -state -jobs -unﬁlled -snow -ﬁghter -
caseworkers -joam40zk0w/ . Involving workers in key decisions  such as the issue raised in LD 1916  is 
important to ﬁnding solu�on s and ensuring key details are not missed.  We have seen in recent years the 
Legislature make changes aﬀec�ng workloads or schedules ; this can  create unintended consequences 
that have caused workers to transfer to other posi�ons or leave state service .  
 
Some o p�ons  we e ncourage this  commitee to consider:   
• Vote ou ght not to pass;  
• Establish an hourly s�pend  for these posi�ons to ensure the  workers  are compensated for th ese 
changes or establish stand by pay for those inspectors covering during state closures ; 
• Provide funding for these posi�ons to be reclassiﬁ ed recognizing this addi�onal responsibility ;  
• Another approach is the commitee could carry this bill over  and take it up if the Department 
does not come up with a solu�on or coverage.  
 
Thank you and I would be happy to answer any ques�ons.
