Testimony of Senator Stacey Guerin 
Presenting L.D. 1916, An Act to Classify Meat and Poultry Products Inspections as 
Essential Services 
Before the Agriculture, C0l1S6l'V2tl0Il and Forestry Committee 
May 15, 2023 
Senator Ingwerson, Representative Pleucker, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry I am Senator Stacey Guerm andI 
represent District 4, which includes all of Piscataqms County and 11 commtuiities in Penobscot 
County I’m pleased to be with you today to present L D 1916, An Act to Classyfv Meat and 
Poultry Products Inspectzons as Essentzal Servzces 
Under the Mame Meat and Poultry Inspection program, daily inspections of small to medium 
sized livestock and poultry facilities are required According to the Maine Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and F orestry’s website, these inspections take place to ensure that 
“livestock used in the production of meat and poultry products are humanely handled, disease- 
free not adulterated, and correctly labeled and packaged” 
The ability for livestock and poultry facilities to conduct business and make product shipping 
deadlines is hinged upon these inspections If an inspection does not take place, the facility is 
unable to do things such as slaughter, package or label product Tlns has a consequential ripple- 
effect on the business and our citizens who want to purchase locally grown food Available 
inspections are an nnpoitant aspect of the local food movement 
Unfortunately, since state inspectors are not classiﬁed as essential state workers, when the state 
closes, these businesses and their employees must all but halt their work In the three-month span 
from December l6, 2022 to March l4, 2023, state ofﬁces were closed ﬁve days with two 
additional days resulting in early closures I should note that those days do not represent the 
holidays, which occurred during that time frame 
I am before you today presenting this legislation because constituents of mine, and likely some 
of yours, have been signiﬁcantly impacted by these closures Meanwhile, similar facilities that 
are mspected by the U S Department of Agriculture (USDA) do not experience the same 
weighty outcomes because their inspectors are essential Even m cases of federal government 
shutdowns, USDA inspectors continue with business as usual This legislation would make 
inspections under the MMPI and licensmg program essential services so when a stateof
emergency 1s declared the fac1l1t1es that fall under these programs do not suffer ﬁnancral 
hardslnp and backlogs 1n thelr Work 
By passmg L D 1916, we can create a falrer playmg ﬁeld for all of Ma1ne’s meat and poultry 
fac1l1t1es wh1le ensunng that Mame c1t1zens can contmue to support locally grown and processed 
food
