Good Morning 
My name is Arthur Bisson, and I am representing our family-owned business, 
L&P Bisson & Sons, lnc Topsham, Me. We have been in business for 93 years. 
Over the years we have had problems getting an inspector due to the weather. 
If it's snowing, the State closes down and we have no inspector for when we are 
slaughtering. One time this past year it was just raining, and the State closed 
down. It is very frustrating and difficult for us. We are considered essential. 
We could have 30 pigs scheduled or 12 beef scheduled for one day and due to 
the weather, and the State decides to close down, we can't have an inspector, it 
makes it very difÔ¨Åcult. Inspectors are not available at the drop of a hat. What are 
we to do with these 30 pigs or 12 beef? Because we are already booked for the 
year, it's not easy to try to re-book 30 pigs or 12 beef. Because we can't always 
have an inspector, That would mean we would have to call the customer to pick 
up their animals for another date which could be quite a while because we 
already have other animals booked. It's not only hard on us but the customer 
also. lt could possibly mean losing that customer because we could not come 
through for them. How long do you think we could stay in business if they 
decided to go somewhere else? 
The State needs to reconsider this issue and make the inspectors available to 
the slaughterhouses even though the weather is stormy.
