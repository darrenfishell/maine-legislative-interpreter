Testimony of Rep. Lydia Crafts introducing 
LD 380, An Act Regarding Monhegan Plantation 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government 
Good Afternoon, Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on State and Local Government. I am Representative Lydia Crafts and have 
the honor of serving District 46. I am here today to present LD 380, “An Act Regarding 
Monhegan Plantation. ” 
As the Representative for Monhegan Plantation, I come before you to request legislative action 
on behalf of my island constituents. Without the ability to pass their own ordinances, I bring LD 
380 before this committee in hopes of making a productive change on behalf of the island 
residents. On January 23, 2023, the Board of the Monhegan Water Company voted unanimously 
to support the transfer of the island’s water company to Monhegan Plantation. This proposal, 
with the support of the water company, was brought to the island’s annual meeting on April 8, 
2023. The warrant article was posted online in compliance with state regulations. The island 
community voted in support of the change at April’s meeting and the Plantation provided the 
amendment shared prior to today’s hearing. 
Additional written testimony is provided today by Plantation residents. I am happy to answer any 
questions today and provide additional information at the bill’s work session.
