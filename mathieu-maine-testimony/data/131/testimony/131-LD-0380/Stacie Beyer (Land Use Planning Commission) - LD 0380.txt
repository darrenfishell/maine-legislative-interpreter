NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST LD 380 
 
An Act Regarding Monhegan Plantation 
 
APRIL 25, 2023 
 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State 
and Local Government, my name is Stacie Beyer, and I am the Executive Director of the Maine 
Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC). I am speaking as neither for nor against LD 380, An 
Act Regarding Monhegan Plantation. 
 
This bill was a concept draft that would support Monhegan Plantation in addressing any needs 
arising during the 131st Legislature. I understand that the sponsor of this bill, Representative 
Craft, has amended the concept draft bill. The new title is An Act Providing for the Supply of 
Water to Monhegan Plantation. The amendment would transfer the assets and obligations of the 
Monhegan Water Company to Monhegan Plantation. It would also provide general rule-making 
authority to the Monhegan Plantation Board of Assessors to prevent pollution and preserve the 
purity of the water of “the meadow aquifer.” 
 
LUPC serves as the planning, zoning, and permitting authority for Maine’s unorganized and 
deorganized areas, which include plantations that do not have local control over land use. 
Monhegan Plantation is in the Commission’s service area. 12 M.R.S. §681. 
 
This bill would significantly improve Monhegan Plantation’s ability to ensure the integrity and 
quality of its sole source of fresh water from the meadow aquifer on Monhegan Island. LUPC 
supports the Plantation taking a more proactive approach to managing its aquifer. Section 7 of 
the proposed amendment to LD 380 would allow the Plantation to adopt and administer rules 
relevant to protecting this critical resource. 
 
However, depending on how the Plantation would draft rules responsive to Section 7, there is 
potential for overlapping jurisdictions of LUPC and Monhegan Plantation in “the meadow 
aquifer.” LUPC would welcome language clarifying the intent of Section 7 and minimizing 
conflicts between the two jurisdictions, including rules already adopted by LUPC for the protection 
of the aquifer. 
 
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions at the work session.
