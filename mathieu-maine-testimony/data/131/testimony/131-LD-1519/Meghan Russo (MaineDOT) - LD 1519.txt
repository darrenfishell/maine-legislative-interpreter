RE:  MaineDOT Opposition to LD 1519, An Act to Amend the Laws Governing 
Operating Under the Influence  
 
              
 
 
Senator B eebe-Center , Representative Sal isbury, and members of the Criminal Just ice and Public 
Safety Committee, MaineDOT would like to submit the following comments in oppositio n to LD 
1519, An Act to Amend the Laws Govern ing O perating Under the Influence .   
 
LD 1519 proposes to make adjustments to the section  of motor vehicle laws pertaining  to 
operating under the  influence .  The 2001 Federal Department of Transportation’s Appropriations 
Act approved by Co ngress and signed by President Clinton provided that state s must pass a .08 
per se  law by 2004 or begin losing federal highway construction funds.  23 U .S.C 163 outlines 
the safety incentives to prevent operation of motor vehicles by intoxicated persons.  Any state 
which raises the limit above .08 would be out of compliance with this section of law and w ould 
be subject to a penalty  for noncompliance .  This penalty  would be withholdings of a percenta ge 
of formula funding from the Federal Highway Administration , estimated to total roughly $12 
million a year .  Federal formula  funds are  the backbone of MaineDOT ’s capital program .  Any 
loss of federal funding would  be detrimental to MaineDOT and our customers , the citizens of 
Maine.  
 
It is for these reasons that MaineDOT ur ges this committee to vote no on LD 1519.
