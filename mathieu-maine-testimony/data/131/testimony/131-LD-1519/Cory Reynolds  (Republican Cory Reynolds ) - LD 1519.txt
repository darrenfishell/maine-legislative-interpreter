LD 1519
IN OPPOSITION TO LD 1519
An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Operating Under the influence
Good Morning, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, I am Cory Reynolds
and I am in Opposition to LD-1519 because
If this bill passes, Maine will become the only state  to allow a breath alcohol level 
above .08. to .09 The most devastating time is when a law enforcement officer is 
having to tell a parent that their child or loved ones has been killed. We should be 
looking for Ways to protect Maine people so we have less car accidents.  I ask you to 
vote Ought Not To Pass on L.D. 1519.
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
