Greeting
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee

Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety:
My
name
is
James
T assé
and
I
submit
this
testimony
on
behalf
of
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
(BCM).
The
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
is
the
statewide
or ganization
that
advocates
for
bicyclists
and
pedestrians,
and
to
protect
the
safety
and
rights
of
vulnerable
users
of
the
public
ways.
The
Coalition
is
opposed
to
LD
1519,
which
would
weaken
the
laws
concerning
operating
under
the
influence
and
its
penalties.
W e
ur ge
an
Ought
Not
T o

report.
The
Coalition
opposes
any
change
in
policy
that
will
make
roads
less
safe,
and
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
is
a
well-documented
unsafe
practice.
LD
1519
both
raises
the
permissible
threshold
for
OUI
from
.08
to
.09
by
breath
analysis,
and
reduces
the
period
of
time
before
a
driver
can
have
their
license
reinstated
after
losing
it
for
an
OUI
of fense.
In
ef fect,
this
bill
would
make
it
harder
for
law
enforcement
to
char ge
OUIs
in
the
field,
and
would
make
it
easier
for
repeat
of fenders
to
get
their
licenses
back.
For
these
reasons,
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
opposes
this
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service
to
the
people
of
Maine.

Testimony on LD 1519 Ought Not to Pass 
An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Operating Under the Influence
Greeting distinguished members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety: 
My name is James Tassé and I submit this testimony on behalf of the Bicycle 
Coalition of Maine (BCM). The Bicycle Coalition of Maine is the statewide 
organization that advocates for bicyclists and pedestrians, and to protect the safety 
and rights of vulnerable users of the public ways. The Coalition is opposed to LD 
1519, which would weaken the laws concerning operating under the influence and its 
penalties.  We urge an Ought Not To Pass report. 
 The Coalition opposes any change in policy that will make  roads less safe, and 
driving under the influence of alcohol is a well-documented unsafe practice. LD 1519 
both raises the permissible threshold for OUI from .08 to .09 by breath analysis, and 
reduces the period of time before a driver can have their license reinstated after losing
it for an OUI offense. In effect, this bill would make it harder for law enforcement to 
charge OUIs in the field, and would make it easier for repeat offenders to get their 
licenses back. 
 
For these reasons, the Bicycle Coalition of Maine opposes this bill. 
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine.
Sincerely,
James Tassé
Assistant Director
Bicycle Coalition of Maine
