Testimony in Opposition of LD 778 An Act Regarding Work Requirements for 
Able-bodied Adults Without Dependents Under the Supplemental Nutritional 
Assistance Program 
 
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee,  
 
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, 
Maineâ€™s Self-Advocacy Network. 
I am in opposition of LD 778 because while many individuals with disabilities want to be 
employed there are many barriers to employment.  This includes transportation, to and 
from work.  Transportation has proven to be unreliable for people with disabilities and 
many have lost their jobs because of transportation.   
For some people with disabilities, they do not have the capacity to work 20 hours a 
week.   
 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Jon McGovern
