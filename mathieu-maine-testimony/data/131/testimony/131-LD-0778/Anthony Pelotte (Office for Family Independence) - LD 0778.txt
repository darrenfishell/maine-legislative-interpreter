Re: Opposition to LD 778 An Act Regarding Work Requirements for Able -bodied Adults Without 
Dependents Under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program  
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Committee Health and Human 
Services:  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to express our strong  opposition to LD 778, An Act Regarding Work 
Requirements for Able -bodied Adults Without Dependents Under the Supplemental Nutrition al 
Assistance Program.   
 
This bill , beginning January 1, 2024, prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from 
requesting certain waivers and exemptions under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program (SNAP).  It prohibits the departmen t from applying for a waiver under 7 Unit ed States Code, 
Section 2015(o)(4), which allows for waivers in specific geographical areas that have unemployment 
over a rate of 10% or  have  insufficient jobs available.  It also prohibits the department from providing 
exemptions to work requirements for up to 12% of individuals receiving SNAP benefits pursuant to 7 
United States Code, Section 2015(o)(6)(E).   
 
The proposed bill would exacerbate food insecurity and very low food security (missed meals) for 
Maine’s residents during times when there are very high unemployment rates in Maine or areas where 
there are insufficient employment opportunities. It is imperative to retain Maine’s ability to use these  
flexibilities in times of increased need. Restricting these allowable waiver options steps away from the 
overall goals of the SNAP program, which is to provide nutrition assistance.   
 
In addition to high unemployment rates and recent reductions  in SNAP benefits, food insecur e Mainers 
are experiencing higher than ever food c osts. The all -items Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of 
economy -wide inflation , reported a 9.9% increase in food costs in 2022, and expects at least a 7.9 % 
increase in 2023 .  
 
The Department opposes this bill  as it would prove  detrimental to Mainers in need of nutritional 
support during  a time of high food costs and overall cost of living expenses . 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Anthony Pelotte, Director  
Office for Family Independence
