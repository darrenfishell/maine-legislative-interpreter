Testimony in Opposition of LD 778 An Act Regarding Work Requirements for Able-
bodied Adults Without Dependents Under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance 
Program 
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,  
My name is Stephanie Pelletier. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a person who lives with a 
disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, Maine’s Self-Advocacy Network. 
 
I am in opposition to LD 778 because, when people get married with disabilities, they don't have 
a lot of money and their money gets taken away from them and it's good to have food stamps. It 
wouldn't help because if we run out of food in the house, we can’t go to the store and use our 
food stamps to get more food.   
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Stephanie Pelletier
