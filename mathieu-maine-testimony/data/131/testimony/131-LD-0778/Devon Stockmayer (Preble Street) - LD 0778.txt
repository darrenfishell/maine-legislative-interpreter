Hello Chair Baldacci, Representative Meier, and honorable members of the 
Committee on Hea lth and Human Services. My name is Devon Stockmayer, I am 
the Advocacy Supervisor at Preble Street in Portland. I am writing to express my 
collective opposition to the work requirements bills that are being presented before 
the committee today. I urge you to vote in opposition to LD1194: An Act to 
Implement Work Requirements Under the MaineCare Program, LD778: An Act 
Regarding Work Requirements for Able -bodied Adults Wit hout Dependents Under 
the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, and LD784: An Act to Establish 
Work Requirements for Able -bodied Adults Without Dependents. Hindering a 
person ’s ability to achieve and maintain stability —by putting healthy food on the 
table, and having access to quality healthcare, is not the pathway to a stronger 
Maine .  
 
Individuals, families and communities work better when they are happy, healthy, 
and fed. For many of these households, MaineCare and SNAP are the only 
respective pathway s to healthcare access and food security. When folks don’t have 
to worry about where they’re going to find food, or how they’ll take care of an 
illness  or injury , they can devote consistent time and energy to seeking and/or 
maintain ing employment. The prim ary barriers Mainers face in accessing the 
workforce identified in Maine’s Roadmap to End Hunger have little to do with 
“welfare supports” like SNAP and MaineCare . The  real barriers  to which we must 
instead draw our attention  are visible in our communities : affordable housing , 
childcare, and transportation access.  
 
In the chorus favoring stronger work requirements for SNAP and implementing 
them for MaineCare, we hear a desire for individuals to contribute to the 
community. We hear a desire to strengthen and  expand the workforce. Here, I am 
drawn to a report from the Office of Policy and Management, published during the 
LePage administration. It reveals that the enforcement of work requirements does 
not in fact increase employment across the state, encourage,  or enable individuals 
to gain jobs. Over a year, only 4% more of people who lost their SNAP benefits for 
failing to meet work requirements gained new employment —an incremental 
increase.

Instead, the stringency of work requirements contributes to a closed  and continuous 
loop of poverty and struggle. Poverty is multi -faceted in its challenges. People 
must worry about how they’ll have enough to eat for the week, or even the day, or 
face the reality that they cannot see a doctor for a serious illness or injur y without 
the support of MaineCare. Working is  an element of a stable routine which 
becomes nearly impossible to juggle when the supports that help individuals meet 
their basic needs are threatened.  
 
I think of the challenges faced by folks in the unhoused  community  we serve at 
Preble Street.  I know a client who sleeps outside —he is bright and kind and 
personable. He work ed as much as he c ould, be coming a  manager  at the local 
grocery store. Until he had to give up his job because his belongings were being 
stolen while he was at work. In having to surrender his employment, he soon lost 
his SNAP benefits —adding food insecurity to the web of interconnected challenges 
he faced. With the way the system is set up, it can sometimes feel impossible to 
disentangle  and to attempt to exit this cycle of losses .  
 
Food security and healthcare are essential blocks in the foundation of stability that 
allows people to work. Maine and its workforce will be made stronger not by 
tightening work requirements for our struggling co mmunity members, but by 
maintaining, and even bolstering the very supports that allow us all to stand 
together at our jobs and in our communities.
