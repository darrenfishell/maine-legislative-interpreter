Regarding the consideration to allow Sunday hunting, of any type, I stand in 
opposition.  During the various hunting seasons, Sunday is the only day for 
non-hunters to use both private and public land for non-hunting activity; confident in 
the knowledge that there are no  hunters in the vicinity.   Please, No Hunting of Any 
Type on Sundays.  Indeed non-hunters, deserve one day to recreate in the natural 
world free from the potential hazards present when hunters are roaming the roads, 
woods and fields.  Thank you in advance for holding fast to “No Hunting on Sunday”.
