Sunday Hunting Proposal.
Tim and Maggie Davis, Vienna, ME 04360.  91 acres.
We currently do not post our land out of respect for our neighbors who wish to hunt 
legally.  We also work with our local snowmobile club to allow access for a trail 
through our property.  We neither hunt or use snowmobiles but we respect others who
do so - as long as it is done legally and with respect for our family and property.  We 
strongly oppose Sunday hunting of any sort as it will impact our ability to have free 
access to our land for hiking and other activities that we do enjoy throughout the year.
Should Sunday hunting in any form be allowed we will be forced to post our property 
in order to protect our right to have free and safe access to our land.  We feel that 
there is ample opportunity for 6 days a week for hunters to access our property.  We 
do not see a need to deny ourselves at least one day a week when we can feel safe to 
walk on our land.  Thank you for considering our ongoing opposition to any Sunday 
hunting proposals.
