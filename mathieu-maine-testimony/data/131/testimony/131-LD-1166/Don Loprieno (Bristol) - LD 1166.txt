I am writing to oppose LD 1166 which is yet another effort to pass some form of 
Sunday hunting in Maine.  It’s not the first time.  In fact, there have been no fewer 
than 39 attempts in the last 45 years.
Some of us may remember when salesmen went door-to-door trying to sell 
something.  If their offer was rejected (and they had quick reflexes) they’d put their 
foot in the door before it was entirely closed.  And they wouldn’t give up either.  
They’d be back again and again, until a sale was made, generally out of sheer 
frustration by the homeowner.  By now, it ‘s a technique that’s widely recognized as a
foot-in-the door approach. That’s what we have here.
It ignores the will of the people, stated again and again over time.     Most recently in 
2022, the Maine Legislature directed the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
to commission a survey of the general public, landowners, and hunters regarding 
Sunday hunting. The results of the survey unambiguously show that Mainers do not 
want Sunday hunting. 
Some key findings of the survey showed that 55% of the general population opposes 
Sunday hunting.  The percentages were even higher with landowners by sections of 
the state: Northeast 62% opposed; Central also 62% opposed; South 81% opposed.    
Efforts over the years including this bill to circumvent overwhelming public opinion 
undermine both established hunting efforts in Maine and all-important relationships 
with private landowners who provide access to their lands.   We all know a foot in the
door when we see one.  The same is true of a slippery slope.
