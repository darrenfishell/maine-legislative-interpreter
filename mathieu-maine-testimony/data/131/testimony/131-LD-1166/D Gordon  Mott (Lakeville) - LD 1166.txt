Testimony of D. Gordon Mott 
To the Joint Legislative Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife in the 131st Session
Against LD 1166   to Allow Sunday Hunting by Landowners on Their Land   
Honorable Members of the IF&W Committee, Chairs Senator LaFountain and Representative 
Landry. My name is D. Gordon Mott. I am a private landowner in Lakeville, Penobscot County. 
This bill does not limit Sunday hunting to the ordinary fall seasons for birds, deer and 
moose. It allows Sunday hunting day and night for coyotes nine months of the year and then for 
all species in the day for the rest of the year.
Most of our personal land is posted because hunters are not required to get permission from
us as landowners and are free to come in when they please. 
Only when a rational proposal for Sunday hunting over a limited period of time is brought 
forward, combined with a requirement for hunters to get landowners’ permission, would I 
consider any change from Maine’s bar to Sunday hunting.
Thank you for your consideration and for your public service,
D. Gordon MottD. Gordon Mott D. Gordon Mott ForesterForester
