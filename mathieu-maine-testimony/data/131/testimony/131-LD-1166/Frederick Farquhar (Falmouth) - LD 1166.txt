We have owned woodlands for a long time. In that time, hunting and other activities 
have gone on without our permission. We have deer shot illegally, ATVers tear up the
land and marijuana grown in places. Most of our neighbors are respectful, but some 
assume they may do whatever they want if no one is there to stop them. We have 
posted the property and seen the signs shot down. We have had waste dumped on our 
land. We therefore do not want any more incentives offered that will further abuse 
what we are trying to preserve in its natural state.
