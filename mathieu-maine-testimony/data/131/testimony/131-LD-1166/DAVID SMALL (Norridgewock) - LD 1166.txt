LD 1166
I own over one thousand acres of land , and I support Maine's prohibition on Sunday 
hunting. Although the inherent danger of hunting is greatly decreased if a hunter is 
hunting on his/her own property, passing LD 1166 is unfair to others, and would tend 
to create a rift between property owning hunters and those wo do not own property. 
Beyond that, I believe that enforcement of such legislation would be extremely 
difficult
