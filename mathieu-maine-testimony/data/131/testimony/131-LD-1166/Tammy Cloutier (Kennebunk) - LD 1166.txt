LD 1166
Please oppose LD 1166 An Act to Allow Sunday Hunting by Landowners on their 
Land. 
Introducing yet another Sunday hunting bill using Landowners as the target group 
does nothing to hide the fact that this is another attempt by a minority to find a “back 
door” into allowing Sunday hunting for what appears to be one purpose, and then 
using that foothold to expand on an activity that Maine citizens DO NOT WANT. 
How many times must Maine citizens explicitly state that they do NOT want to allow 
hunting on Sundays? The Sunday hunting ban has been in place since the 1880s, and 
despite multiple attempts to overturn it, Mainers continue to uphold the ban. In fact, in
a 2021 survey by the IFW, the MAJORITY OPPOSED Sunday hunting. Overturning 
the Sunday hunting ban also does not make sense due to the ongoing trend of an 
overall decline in hunting.
