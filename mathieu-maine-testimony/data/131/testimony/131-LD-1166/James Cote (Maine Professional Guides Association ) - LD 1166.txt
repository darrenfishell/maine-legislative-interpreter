Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and members of the committee, my name
is James Cote and I am writing today on behalf of the Maine Professional Guides 
Association in opposition to the Sunday hunting proposals you are hearing today. For 
the sake of efficiency, I offer this testimony on all bills. 
Now please, don’t get me wrong. MPGA has long supported the creation of new 
opportunities for hunters. However, the topic of Sunday hunting creates an added 
layer of complexity. 
Some MPGA members support Sunday hunting, while many others oppose it. 
Reasons for opposition vary but include support for a day off where guides can 
transition clients in and out of camp, potential changes or reductions in season 
frameworks, and increased user conflicts. We also have great concern about how 
landowners that our members will react if Sunday hunting were to pass. Will 
landowners post land and subsequently cancel things like bear bait leases or road 
access for guides that currently have those permissions? There are many dynamics 
and potential unintended consequences that could impact Maine’s hunting industry 
and guides in ways that the general public may not feel. These are small businesses 
that support hunting, support youth, and very rural and local economies and we ask 
that you keep them in mind as you deliberate on these proposals. 
I wish I had a silver bullet to resolve this policy debate, but as you know it is 
extremely dynamic and impacts a range of stakeholders. On balance, the association 
takes all of these factors into account and opposes these pieces of legislation because 
of the value we place in our relationships with landowners large and small. 
Thank you for your consideration.
