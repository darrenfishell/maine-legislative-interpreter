To the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee re: Sunday Hunting for youths, bow 
hunters and landowners
This issue about Sunday hunting has been brought up repeatedly and repeatedly voted
down by the public and the land owners.  The majority don't want it, and they've 
spoken.  
Bottom line, if any of these bills pass, more land will be posted.  I don't think anyone 
wants this.
Thank you for allowing me to submit my testimony as both a landowner and a 
Registered Maine Master Guide.
