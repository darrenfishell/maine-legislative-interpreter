I am a landowner in western Maine. I do not currently hunt, although I have in the 
past. I regularly work in our woodlot and exercise our dogs there, in all seasons. 
While this bill on its face seems reasonable, it will have the effect of shutting off the 
current one day per week opportunity for worry-free use of our property during the 
fall, since we have a half dozen neighboring properties which we would not have 
complete confidence in being firearm free on Sundays.  Posting our own land would 
not completely erase this concern, even with 30 acres under our ownership. Please 
leave the one-day hunting restriction in place.
