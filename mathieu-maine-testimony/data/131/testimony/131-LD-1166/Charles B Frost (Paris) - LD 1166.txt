Dear Honorable Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee: 
 
 
My name is Charles Frost a landowner living in Paris, Maine.  My land is also in the 
Town of Paris.  I am writing to you to express my opposition to LD 626, LD 1166, and 
LD 1241. 
 
I have always welcomed hunters on my 300 acres and never required hunters to 
request permission to hunt on my property.  My son, granddaughter, and grandson 
enjoy hunting and often invite their friends to join them during the annual deer season. 
 
My wife is not a hunter but does enjoy being outside.  We often take our two dogs and 
hike on Sundays knowing that it is safe to be in the woods on this day of the week.  
Since I make my land available for 6 of the 7 days each week during bow season and 
the six week rifle season, I believe it only reasonable that I be able to be in my woods 
one day each week with my dogs without worry of disturbing a hunter or of someone 
being accidently shot.   
 
It would pain me to post my land to allow hunting by written permission only or to simply 
close the property to all hunting should this proposal pass. 
 
After reviewing the recent Sunday hunting survey results of Maine hunters and 
nonhunters alike, it is apparent to me that Maine people do not want Sunday hunting 
approved.  So, whom ever is promoting the idea of Sunday hunting should knock it off. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration of this issue. 
 
 
Yours truly, 
 
 
Charles B. Frost
