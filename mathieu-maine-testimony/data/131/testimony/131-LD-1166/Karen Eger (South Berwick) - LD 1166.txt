Dear Legislators, 
 
I am a landowner (about 100 acres in South Berwick) who has never posted my land against hunting of any kind.  I 
am not opposed to hunting though certain of Maineâ€™s regulations (open season on coyotes) disturbs me.  I 
appreciate the heritage, science, and culture of hunting and probably would be a bow hunter myself had I grown 
up in that culture.   
 
I oppose Sunday hunting and would likely post my property for the first time if Sunday hunting is allowed.  People 
in Maine have spoken again and again against Sunday hunting and I resent the reappearance of these bills taking 
your time from the vital issues that need to be addressed in our state.  But here we are AGAIN.  Please oppose this 
bill.
