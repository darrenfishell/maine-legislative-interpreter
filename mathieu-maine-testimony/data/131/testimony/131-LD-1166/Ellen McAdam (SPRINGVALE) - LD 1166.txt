McDougal Orchards is opposed to any and all proposals to open public and/or private 
lands to unrestricted Sunday (i.e. not by special permit) hunting.  Bullets travel. Much
as a landowner might like his ammunition to stay on his own property, there's no way 
to make sure it does.  Again, if you want to hunt on Sunday, talk to a farmer with deer
issues and get a depredation permit.
