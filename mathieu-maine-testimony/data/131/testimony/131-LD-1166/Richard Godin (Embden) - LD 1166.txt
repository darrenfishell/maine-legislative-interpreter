Sunday hunting would require a large increase of overall 
law enforcement work hours, personnel equipment and 
training for additional resources to enforce the law. This 
is a huge financial and logistic burden , which could be 
funded by all of us through higher taxes, higher license 
fees, all recreational fee sources and additional vehicles 
for enforcement. 
Sunday is a day of rest. It is a day that family's gather to 
reflect on all we have. To enjoy the outdoors as a family, 
no matter the time of year , without the pressures of 
hunﬂng. 
lf this passes, it could have an impact on our base hunting 
season dates, bag limits and eligible days of hunting as we 
know it. Example: l am an avid hunter, so this could mean 
less eligible days for me to hunt, Monday through 
Saturday , as Sundays are added, other days could be 
shaved off the calendar to keep the same open days of 
hunﬂng.

Sunday , other than for a few greedy people.
