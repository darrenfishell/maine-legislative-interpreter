As a Maine woodlands owner, a farmer, and a hunter for over 60 years, I would like 
to make clear my opposition to Sunday hunting by any group under any conditions!
One day per week to safely enjoy my woodland does not seem like an unreasonable 
request.
Sunday hunting in Maine has been reviewed and defeated 39 times in the past 45 
years.  That should be Enough!!
The latest Survey (2022) by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife clearly 
shows what the majority of Maine people wantâ€¦no Sunday hunting!!!
Thank you for your attention to this very important issue.
