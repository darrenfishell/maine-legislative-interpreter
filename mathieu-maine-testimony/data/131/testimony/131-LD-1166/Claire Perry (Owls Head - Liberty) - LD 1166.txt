LD 1166
Dear IF&W Committee Members: 
I am writing in opposition to LD 1166
As acceptable as this sounds on the surface, it gives a select group of individuals a 
right to do something from which another group is excluded. This "something" is the 
right to hunt an extra day a week.
 These days are selected, (along with our WMD's) with science as the foundation to 
help strike a certain balance. Thus, allowing this extra day every week, will probably 
end up limiting the season as it stands now, and will cause bad blood among the 
"haves" and the "have-nots".
Maine has one day a week when our woodland inhabitants are free from hounds 
running at large,  guns and arrows. It would be smart to keep it that way. 
Just another misguided attempt to get Sunday hunting on the books. No need for it.
