LD 1166
As a hiker and woodlot owner I am opposed to ALL hunting in Maine on Sundays.  
We need at least one day a week when we can hike and use our woodlot without the 
fear of being shot.  I am opposed to LD 1166.  Of course, bullets do not recognize 
property lines.  Therefore, passage of LD 1166 would mean that bullets could come 
into my property or where ever I am on Sundays.  This is why LD 1166 should fail.  
There are 6 days a week that are already available to hunters.  They already have half 
the weekend days.  Give us just one day week, Sunday, to use our land and hiking 
areas without the presence of hunters.  This is not too much to ask.  Letâ€™s ask instead 
for hunters to be better citizens by respecting Sunday as a no hunt day.  Please fail LD
1166.
