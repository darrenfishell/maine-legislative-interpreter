I am writing to register my opposition to the three bills related to Sunday hunting: 
 
LD 626, An Act to Preserve Maine's Sporting Heritage and Enhance Sporting Opportunities for Maine's 
Youth by Allowing Maine's Youth to Hunt on Sunday 
LD 1166, An Act to Allow Sunday Hunting by Landowners on Their Land 
LD 1241, An Act to Allow Sunday Hunting with a Bow and Arrow or Crossbow 
 
It seems like there are bills to try to allow Sunday hunting in almost every legislative session, and every 
time they are rejected. It is clear that the people of Maine do not want to allow Sunday hunting of any 
kind (based on the number of bills rejected and the 2022 report “Maine Residents’, Hunters’, 
and Landowners’ Attitudes Toward Sunday Hunting” conducted for the IF&W). The landowners who are 
generous enough to allow hunting on their land, as well as the non-hunting public who enjoy outdoor 
recreation, should have one day where they can enjoy Maine’s outdoors without being concerned about 
hunters. Please do not allow Sunday hunting of any kind in Maine!
