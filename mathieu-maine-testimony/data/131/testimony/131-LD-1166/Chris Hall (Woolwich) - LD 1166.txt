My wife and I are registered "Maine Woodland Owner" in Woolwich with 55 acres in
Tree Growth; we are also enrolled in the National Tree Farm system, and we have 
lived here since 1986. We have never posted our land, and we allow hunting for 
turkey and deer for anyone that asks, including for bow-hunting and black powder 
seasons. Many of our neighbors have taken advantage of this, and we welcome deer 
hunters in particular, as the deer herd can be an annoyance for our gardens. However, 
living as we do in the midst of our holdings, we have found the non-hunting aspect of 
Sundays to be crucial for staying ahead of things, particularly for harvesting the 5 
cord of firewood that we put up each fall to dry for the 2nd winter out. We need that 
7th day for our own  woodland affairs.
If Sunday hunting becomes established by the legislature, we will certainly be forced 
to post our acres, thereby shutting down a long time tradition -- no long-guns, no 
bows, no youth. Everybody loses.
