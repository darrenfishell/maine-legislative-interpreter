LD 1166
Senator Lafountain, Representative Landry and esteemed members of the Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife committee, my name is Tyler Brown and I am writing in 
opposition to LD 1166 "An Act to Allow Sunday Hunting by Landowners on Their 
Land".
Though I appreciate this bill is intended to open Sundays incrementally by allowing 
landowners of 5 acres or more to hunt their property, it fails to create equal hunting 
opportunity  non-landowning hunters, youth hunters and waterfowl hunters. A 
significant portion of hunters do not own their own land, waterfowl hunters do no 
own the waters they hunt on.
Opening Sundays for all hunting season, would change the start and end dates of 
waterfowl season as currently Sundays do not count against the federally set amount 
of days set for waterfowl seasons. Where a majority waterfowl hunters hunt on 
publicly owned waterways, they would not benefit from this bill yet it would shorten 
their season in some seasons by over two weeks.
There is also the confusion on the differentiating amount of land one needs to own as 
25 acres are required to be entered into the landowner antlerless permit lottery. While 
I appreciate the sponsors desire to include as many landowners as possible, the 
different sized lots for hunting programs here in Maine would make this provision a 
confusing standard.
Maine already provides ample hunting opportunity for everyone from landowners to 
non-residents, this bill would provide extra opportunity for landowners while 
excluding all other hunters from hunting on Sunday and sets a bad precedent. I ask 
that you vote "Ought not to Pass" on LD 1166.
Thank you for considering my testimony.
