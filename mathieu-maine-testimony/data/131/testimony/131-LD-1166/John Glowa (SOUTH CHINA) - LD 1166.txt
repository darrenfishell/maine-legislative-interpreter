Re: Sunday Hunting

My name is John M. Glowa, Sr.  I reside in South China, ME.  I am writing one testimony for these three 
pro-Sunday hunting bills.  I am submitting this testimony for each bill separately as the issue is identical 
for each.  That is opening the door to Sunday hunting in Maine. 
As I testified on a prior pro-Sunday hunting bill, the mission of the radical extremist minority is to not 
stop until they achieve unrestricted Sunday hunting.  Each of these bills is an attempt to get their foot in 
the Sunday hunting door.  It is essential to look at these bills as part of their overall goal, not to consider 
them independently.  Passage of just one bill will put Maine on that slippery slope and they will not stop 
until they are successful, regardless of what anyone else wants. 
It is unfortunate for the vast majority of Maine hunters that these radical extremists will jeopardize all 
hunting to achieve their own selfish goal.  This fringe group and their incessant calls for Sunday hunting 
give hunters and hunting a bad name.  Should these radicals with even one such bill, they can expect not 
only the closure large amounts of privately owned land to hunting, they can expect the State of Maine 
to adopt a reverse posting law.  I encourage them to think long and hard before they propose any more 
pro-Sunday hunting legislation.  
In order to put an end to this public resource wasting nonsense once and for all, I recommend that the 
committee amend these bills by deleting the existing language and rewriting the bills to support a Maine 
Constitutional Amendment prohibiting any and all hunting on Sunday. 
Thank you.
