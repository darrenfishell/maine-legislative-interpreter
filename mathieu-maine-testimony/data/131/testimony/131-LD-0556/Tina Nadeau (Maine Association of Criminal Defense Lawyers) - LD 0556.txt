Box 17642 Portland, ME 04112-8642 (207) 523-9869      mainemacdl@gmail.com  March 9, 2023   Senator Ben Chipman, Chair Representative Lynne Williams, Chair Committee on Transportation 100 State House Station, Room 126 Augusta, ME 04333   RE: LD 556: An Act Concerning Bureau of Motor Vehicles Fees, Fines, and Driver’s License Reinstatement   Dear Chair Chipman, Chair William, and Honorable Members of the Transportation Committee:   I am here today on behalf of MACDL to testify in support of LD 556. Thank you to Representative Rana and the many co-sponsors of this important bill.  Although we have not yet seen the precise language proposed in this bill, the concept draft language was enough for our organization to wholeheartedly support the proposal.  When fines and fees accumulate, many Mainers cannot get out from under the weight of those fines—which can cause them to have their driver’s licenses remain suspended or revoked indefinitely and which, if the person drives, could subject them to increasingly brutal criminal penalties—including more fines, additional license suspension or revocation, and even mandatory prison time. People throughout this state are struggling financially: this bill could help ease some of this hardship.  Losing the right to drive indefinitely affects people’s employment, their family responsibilities, their freedom. Anything this Legislature can do to imbue the Secretary of State with the authority it needs to alleviate some of this burden would be life-changing for so many people who are currently in the Catch-22 of “I can’t drive without a valid license; I can’t work if I can’t drive; I can’t earn money to pay my fines and fees if I can’t work.” The cycle catches far too many people in this trap.  Thank you for your consideration, for your attention to this matter, and for allowing me to submit this testimony on behalf of Maine’s defense attorneys and the clients we proudly serve.                    Sincerely,                                         

                              Tina Heather Nadeau, Esq.                               MACDL Executive Director
