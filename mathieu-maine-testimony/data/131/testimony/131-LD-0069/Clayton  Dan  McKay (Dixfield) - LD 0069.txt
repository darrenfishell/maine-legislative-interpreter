LD 69
Chairman Lawrence, Chairman Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT 
Committee
I am writing to hopefully influence the committee into amending LD 69. LD 69 directs the PUC to 
make rules to require standard offer providers to disclose each generation source they use, which they 
now do. Because they purchase from the wholesale market which uses a clearinghouse pricing 
mechanism for all sources of generation used in the day ahead market and the real time market, it is 
impossible to disclose individual source pricing. They bid in November offering a standard offer from 
market futures or the year ahead, i.e. January 2023 to December 2023.
I propose the PUC return to a disclosure statement that has already been used, but, for some reason 
disappeared from view ( on their website) which broke down the costs of electricity into a supply 
portion and a delivery portion. Within theses categories a detailed breakdown of costs relating to 
RGGI, EMT procurements from investor-owned utilities, Renewable Energy Credits, Long Term 
Renewable Energy Contracts, Net Energy Billing, Federal funds directed towards transmission and/or 
renewable projects, transmission projects designated by ISO-NE as " Reliability Projects" that Maine 
ratepayers are charged an amount proportional to its consumption of electricity derived from the New 
England Market.
People should be informed how much of their money used to buy electricity is spent on laws that 
promise lower rates and reductions in fossil fuel emissions. 
From this information, lawmakers can perhaps come up with a plan that will lower rates and 
emissions, because what we have now is futility.
