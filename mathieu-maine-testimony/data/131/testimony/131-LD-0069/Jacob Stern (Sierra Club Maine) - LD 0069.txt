 Senat or La wrence, R epresentati ve Zeig ler, and the members of the Joint Committ ee onEner gy, Utilities, and T echnology ,
I am t estifying t oday on behalf of Sierr a Club Maine, r epresenting o ver 22,000 support ersand members stat ewide. F ounded in 1892, Sierr a Club is one of our nation ’s oldest andlargest en vironmental or ganizations. W e work diligentl y to amplify the po wer of our 3.8million members nation-wide as w e work towards combating climat e change andpromoting a just and sustainable econom y. To that end, w e ur ge an “oug ht not t o pass”report on L.D . 69:An Act to Impr ove Electric al SupplyCost T ranspar ency.
The legislation bef ore us purports t o incr ease tr anspar ency with r egard to pricing ofelectric suppl y. While Sierr a Club br oadl y supports incr easing tr anspar ency f or consumers,we are concerned that the impact of this legislation w ould be, if enact ed, the e xact opposit e.As dr afted, the legislation w ould not r equir e utilities t o list the per centage of each r esour cethat goes int o their electricity mix. Nor w ould it serv e to educat e ratepayers on ho welectricity costs ar e det ermined. B y pr oviding onl y a partial lens int o ener gy pricing, thislegislation ma y inad vertently cause r atepayers t o mak e consumer decisions that ar e neitherin the best int erest of their w allet or our climat e.
The int erconnect ed natur e of our New Eng land grid means that ener gy costs ar e dependenton a wide r ange of f actors and a simple line-b y-line a verage w ould hide the importantcomple xity behind those numbers. F or example, if suppliers chose t o pur chase f ewerrenew ables, the y would be f orced t o meet demand b y contr acting with dirtier , expensi vegener ators. Normall y these dirty electricity gener ating f acilities ar e onl y needed duringperiods of peak ener gy use and ar e typicall y the most e xpensi ve to oper ate. In this w ay, bypurchasing r enew ables, suppliers ar e keeping prices do wn. This nuance w ould be lost inthe pr oposed legislation.

Lastl y, this legislation f ails t o requir e that utilities disclose other e xternalities associat edwith electricity gener ation. A ccor ding t o a 2013 stud y, the cost of the health impacts alonefrom f ossil fuel-gener ated electricity in this country is estimat ed to be o ver $886 billionannuall y.1Any legislation that aims t o educat e residentsabout the costs of electricitygener ation must tak e int o account these secondary costs.
While w e would pot entiall y be open t o a v ersion of this legislation that consider ed theaforementioned concerns. Ho wever, as writt en, w e ur ge an “oug ht not t o pass” r eport onL.D. 69:An Act to Impr ove Electric al Supply C ostTranspar ency. Thank y ou for your time.
