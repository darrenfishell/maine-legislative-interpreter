Testimony of Rep. Jan Dodge introducing 
LD 1588, An Act to Provide Public Sector Labor Unions Reasonable Access to 
Information Regarding Employees 
Before the Labor and Housing Committee 
Good aﬁemoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and distinguished members of the 
Labor and Housing Committee. My name is Jan Dodge, and I represent House District #39, 
Belfast, Northport and Belmont. I am before you today to present LD 1588, An Act to Provide 
Public Sector Labor Unions Reasonable Access to Information Regarding Employees. 
The Maine Education Association asked me to sponsor this bill to improve on LD 1451 that was 
enacted in the 129th Legislative Session. This bill clariﬁes the existing law around public sector 
employers providing contact information for all represented employees, not just new hires. 
Those who testify after me will be highlighting the reasons for the speciﬁcs in the bill. 
We also are working on amendment language to present. We hope to include a dispute resolution 
process through the local collective bargaining agreement. Also, when the bill was drafted, “date 
of hire” was not included in the bill language speciﬁcally and should appear in each of the four 
sections. This omission was raised as a concern by Anya Trundy of DAFS. 
I would ask that you direct your questions to the people who have working knowledge of the 
situations this bill will address. 
Thank you for your time.
