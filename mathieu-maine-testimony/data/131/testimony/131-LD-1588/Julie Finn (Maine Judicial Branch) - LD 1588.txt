Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 1588, An Act to Provide 
Public Sector Labor Unions Reasonable Access to Information Regarding 
Employees: 
 
 Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to 
provide testimony and comments regarding this bill.  
 
LD 1588, in part, expands the rights of bargaining agents of public sector unions for 
access to personal contact information about members of a bargaining unit from information 
regarding newly hired employees to, upon request, personal contact information regarding all 
other employees. The collective bargaining agreements negotiated between the Maine State 
Employees Association (MSEA) and the Judicial Branch contain the following provision: 
 
  
Article 18, which appears in all of the Judicial Branch collective bargaining agreements, covers 
the same issues presented by LD 1588. The language of Article 18 provides more detail and 

4.20.23 information than is contained in LD 1588. Specifically, Article 18 requires that information 
regarding new and departing employees be provided within two weeks whereas LD 1588 allows 
30 days.  
 
In addition, the provision in the contract states that the information will be provided 
“upon request, but not more than quarterly.” The timeliness requirement is important to our 
Human Resources staff by ensuring that frequent requests do not become overly burdensome  
 
 I wanted to raise these issues with the committee to ensure that any discrepancies might 
be addressed. 
 
 Thank you for your time and consideration.
