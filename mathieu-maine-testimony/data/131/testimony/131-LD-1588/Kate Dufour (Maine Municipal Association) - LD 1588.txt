In Opposition to  
LD 1588 , An Act to Provide Public Sector Labor Unions Reasonable Access to Information 
Regarding Employees  
 
April 24, 2023  
 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Labor and Housing 
Committee.  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony in opposition to LD 1588 
on behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Association’ s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest.   
Please accept this after deadline  testimony on LD 1588 , as MMA’s Legislative Policy 
Committee  had not established a p osition in time for the public hearing but recently met and  
direct ed staff to oppose  the measure .   
Not only do  municipal leaders believe  the existing law provide s ample time for 
representatives of labor unions to request employee  data, often the process for access ing 
employee information is considered  during  negotiation s over union  contracts.  The  concern 
among municipal officials is that providing this  authority in state statutes will cause a shift in the  
employee and employer relations  that could adversely impact the property taxpayers who fund 
labor contracts.  
Thank you for considering the muni cipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about the Association’s position on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at 
kdufour@memun.org  or 1-800-452-8786.
