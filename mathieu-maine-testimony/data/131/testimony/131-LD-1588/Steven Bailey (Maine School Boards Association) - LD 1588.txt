 TESTIMONY IN OPPOSIT ION TO  
 
L.D. 1588  
 
AN ACT TO PROVIDE PU BLIC SECTOR LABOR UNIONS REASONABLE 
ACCESS TO INFORMATIO N REGARDING EMPLOYEES  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine School Boards 
Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine School 
Boards Association, in opposition to L.D. 1588.  
 
We have obligations as employers of school personnel, some of which are spelled 
out in contracts, others in policy, and still others in statute.  
 
While L.D. 1588 appears to be a revision to prior language, the obligation and the 
ability to provide this information in a timely manner is at times a hardship on 
school district central office personnel. This information is often requested at the 
busiest time of the year, when new personnel are getting their information entered 
into the district and state software and all appropriate forms correctly signed by 
these new staff members. We understand this is a requirement for new personnel, 
and now in this bill the request for all other public employees of the district has 
been added within this bill. This is one more request that interrupts the flow of ef-
ficient management of the schools.   
 
MSBA opposes L.D. 1588 and urges the Labor and Housing Committee to vote 
ought not to pass.
