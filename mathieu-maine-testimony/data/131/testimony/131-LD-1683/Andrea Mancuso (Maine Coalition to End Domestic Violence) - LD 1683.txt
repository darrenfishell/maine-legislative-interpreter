Testimony of Andrea Mancuso, on behalf of the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence 
In SUPPORT of LD 1683: An Act to Provide for Civil Recovery Based on Nonconsensual 
Removal of or Tampering with a Condom and Considering Sexual Assault in Evaluating 
Parental Rights” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Tuesday, May 2, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, I am writing on behalf of the Maine Coalition to End Domestic 
Violence (MCEDV)‘ in support of LD 1653, “An Act to Provide for Civil Recovery Based on 
Nonconsensual Removal of or Tampering with a Condom and Considering Sexual Assault in 
Evaluating Parental Rights” 
The act of nonconsensual removal of or tampering with a condom, also known as 
“stealthing, ” is a common form of reproductive coercion Our network of programs works 
frequently with victims of domestic abuse and violence who experience reproductive 
coercion by their partner, to include stealthing This act implicates the victim’s reproductive 
health’ and their own reproductive autonomy and decision-making 3 Unexpected pregnancy 
is a not uncommon tactic used by abusive people to manipulate their partners into staying in 
a relationship, where the child is then used by the abusive person as a tool for long-term 
coercion, manipulation and abuse LD 1683 would codify an important recognition that 
reproductive coercion is such a violation of trust that it will likely forever impact the ability of 
those two individuals to successfully co-parent any resulting child 
1 MCEDV serves a membership of eight regional domestic violence resource centers as well as the Immigrant 
Resource Center of Maine Our member programs provided services to more than 12,000 victims of domestic 
violence in Maine last year, including court advocacy services in the civil and criminal courts

Th|s blll lays out reasonable cr|ter|a for the famlly courts to use to cons|der whether 
the parent who engaged |n stealthlng behavlor poses a safety rlsk to the ch|ld and to 
address that safety r|sk, and to also deeply cons|der and respond to the reahty that the 
parentmg relatlonshlp between the perpetrator and victim may never be such that mak|ng 
Cl€CISlOl‘lS together IS reasonably posslble, to |nclude conslderatlon of what traumatlc affect
