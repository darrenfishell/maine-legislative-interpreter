LD 1683, “An Act to Provide for Civil Recovery Based on Nonconsensual 
Removal of or Tampering with a Condom and Considering Sexual Assault in 
Evaluating Parental Rights” 
before the Joznt Standzng Commzttee on Judzczary 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint Standmg 
Committee on the Judiciary 
I am Representative Morgan Rielly I represent House District 127, which includes part of my 
hometown of Westbrook I am pleased to provide testimony m support of LD 1683, An Act to 
Provide for Civil Recovery Based on Nonconsensual Removal of or Tampering witha 
Condom and Considering Sexual Assault in Evaluating Parental Rights 
I asked Representative Milliken to be a cosponsor after leaming that “stealthing ” isn’t already a 
civil cause of action I was shocked and this Legislature must address this disturbing issue 
Nonconsensual removing or tampering with a condom 1S rape Period 
LD 1683 creates a civil cause of action for the non-consensual removal of or tampering witha 
condom The bill will also add considerations for when a child was conceived by sexual assault 
or nonconsensual removal of or tampering with a condom in awarding parental rights and 
responsibilities Civil cases are a powerful tool for fmancial recovery and compensation 
And Rep Milliken ’s bill adds victims of nonconsensual removal of or tampering with a condom 
to the list of persons eligible to seek relief under Title 19-A, 21 Chapter 103 regarding protection 
from abuse 
I urge this committee to please vote ‘ought to pass’ on LD 1683 
Thank you so much for your time, and I am happy to take any questions at this time 
District 127 Westbrook
