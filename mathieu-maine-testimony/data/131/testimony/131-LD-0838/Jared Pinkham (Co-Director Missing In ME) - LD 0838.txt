Dear
members
of
the
committee,
I
am
writing
to
express
my
enthusiastic
support
for
LD
838,
An
Act
to
Identify
the
State's
Unidentified
Human
Remains.
This
bill
has
the
potential
to
be
a
landmark
piece
of
legislation,
not
only
for
our
state
but
for
the
country
as
a
whole.
As
a
resident
of
Maine
and
Co-Director
of
the
nonprofit
Missing
In
ME,
I
am
deeply
troubled
by
the
fact
that
the
state
still
has
human
remains
dating
back
to
the
70's
and
80's
that
have
yet
to
be
identified.
The
issue
of
unidentified
human
remains
is
not
just
a
matter
of
statistics
or
bureaucratic
inef ficiency .
It
is
a
deeply
personal
issue
that
af fects
the
lives
of
families
and
loved
ones
of
the
deceased.
By
failing
to
identify
these
remains,
we
are
denying
these
families
closure
and
peace
of
mind,
and
perpetuating
a
cycle
of
trauma
and
grief
that
can
last
for
generations.
Furthermore,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
state
of
Maine
has
over
135
missing
people
and
30
unidentified
human
remains.
Even
the
Medical
Examiner's
Of fice
believes
there
is
crossover
and
that
some
of
our
missing
people
could
be
in
this
unidentified
category .
However ,
with
new
advances
in
forensic
genealogy
technology ,
we
finally
have
the
opportunity
to
solve
these
cases
and
provide
answers
to
the
families
and
loved
ones
of
the
deceased.
The
DNADoe
Project
and
Dave
Mittelman
the
CEO
of
Othram
have
provided
invaluable
public
testimony
in
support
of
this
bill,
highlighting
the
importance
of
using
advanced
DNA
technologies
and
forensic
genealogy
services
to
identify
the
remains
of
the
unidentified
individuals
in
Maine.
Their
expertise
and
support
will
be
instrumental
in
the
success
of
this
bill
and
the
identification
of
these
individuals.
I
believe
that
this
bill
has
the
potential
to
serve
as
a
model
for
other
states
to
follow .
By
demonstrating
the
importance
of
identifying
unidentified
remains
and
the
positive

impacts
that
such
action
can
have
on
communities,
we
can
inspire
other
states
to
take
similar
action
and
help
to
create
a
national
movement
around
this
issue.
In
conclusion,
I
urge
you
to
support
LD
838
and
to
take
bold
action
to
address
the
issue
of
unidentified
human
remains
in
Maine.
By
doing
so,
we
can
make
a
meaningful
impact
on
the
lives
of
countless
families
and
communities,
and
pave
the
way
for
positive
change
across
the
country .
Thank
you
for
your
attention
and
consideration
of
my
testimony .
Sincerely ,
Jared
Pinkham
