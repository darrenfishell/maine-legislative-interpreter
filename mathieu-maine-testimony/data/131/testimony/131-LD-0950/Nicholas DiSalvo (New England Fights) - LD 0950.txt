LD 950
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement & 
Business, my name is Nicholas C. DiSalvo.  I submit this testimony in support of LD 
950.
I have promoted combat sports events in the state of Maine since February 2012.  
Kickboxing and Muay Thai will both be welcomed additions to the state’s burgeoning
combat sports community. 
I am fully confident that the state’s regulatory body for fight sports – the Combat 
Sports Authority of Maine (CSAM) – will oversee kickboxing and Muay Thai events 
with competence and integrity.  Since its creation in 2009 by the 124th Maine 
Legislature, CSAM has sanctioned dozens of mixed-martial-arts and boxing events 
and hundreds of individual fights in the state of Maine.  Thanks to the work of the 
CSAM Board and its staff, there has not been a single serious injury in any of those 
fights over the course of twelve years.  CSAM goes above and beyond to ensure the 
safety of all combat sports participants and the Maine public. 
I hope that the committee will approve LD 950 and adopt the definitions of 
kickboxing and Muay Thai.  I look forward to working with the CSAM to produce 
kickboxing and Muay Thai events in the future.
Thank you.
