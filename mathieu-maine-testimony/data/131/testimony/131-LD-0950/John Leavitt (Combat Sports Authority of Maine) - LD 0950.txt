An Act to Define Kickboxing and Muay Thai in the laws governing Mixed Martial Arts 
and Boxing 
Good Afternoon Senate Chair Curry, Representative Chair Roberts, and members of the 
Committee, 
Thank you for exploring the expansion of professional combat sports in Maine. I support the 
current system in Maine under the oversight of the Combat Sports Authority of Maine (CSAM). 
In 2009 professional Mixed Martial Arts (LD 1089) was approved under the authority of Combat 
Sports Authority of Maine (CSAM) Boxing followed in 2011 (LD 889 attached). Both sports 
have grown in the state without issue, both sports follow national guidelines for safety of the 
athlete under each speciﬁc sport.

By amending the present MRS Chapter 20, speciﬁcally section 523 of the Chapter, to include 
Kickboxing and Muay Thai in the same way Mixed Martial Arts and Boxing are mentioned and 
amend 17-A MRS Section 515 (2-A) to include the same references. This will allow Mixed 
Martial Arts, Boxing, Kickboxing, and Muay Thai events to proceed legally under uniﬁed rules 
by an instate sanctioned body which has operated without incident since its inception in 2009. 
With these amendments I fully support the expanding Kickboxing and Muay Thai in the state of 
Maine. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.
