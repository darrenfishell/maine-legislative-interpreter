Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and distinguished members of the joint standing 
committee on innovation, development, economics advancement and business, My name is 
Edward Miville and I live in Livermore Falls Maine and I am testifying in Support of LD 950
To legalize "Kickboxing and Muay Thai" under the rules of Mixed Martial Arts and Boxing. 
Muay Thai has changed the life of many individuals in this amazing state. Not only will 
legalizing kickboxing and muay thai add to the great combat sporting history of Maine but will 
add additional revenue from shows and give our athletes a place to compete at home vs 
being forced to travel to other states to compete. Thank you
