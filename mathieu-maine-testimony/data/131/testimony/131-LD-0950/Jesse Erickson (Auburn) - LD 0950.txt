LD 950
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement, and 
Business my name is Jesse Erickson, I live in Auburn, Maine and I am testifying in 
support of LD 950 An Act to Define "kickboxing" and "Muay Thai" in the Laws 
Governing Mixed Martial Arts and Boxing. The rules for Muay Thai and Kickboxing 
are a subset of rules already approved for mixed martial arts bouts that are enjoyed by
thousands of Maine people every year. It is my hope that we can clearly define these 
rules and get these sports legalized in the the great state of Maine. Practitioners of 
these sports are currently forced to travel out of state for competition while Mixed 
Martial Arts competitors and Boxers are able to compete in Maine. Maine has a rich 
history in combat sports and I would love to see that extended to Kickboxing and 
Muay Thai. Thank You kindly for your time and consideration.
