LD 950
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Staning Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement, and 
Business, my name is Cameron Sclease, and I live in Lewiston, ME, and I am 
testifying in support of LD 950 an Act to Define "Kickboxing" and "Muay Thai" in 
the Laws Governing Mixed Martial Arts and Boxing. Muay Thai and Kickboxing 
training has greatly enhanced my life, as it has provided an amazing outlet for me to 
grow as a person through hardship and dedication to a craft. Going to the gym and 
bettering myself day in and day out has helped me develop excellent life skills to 
make me a more well-rounded adult. Providing a way for practitioners of Muay Thai 
and kickboxing to exhibit their skills and craft within the state of Maine would greatly
improve the sport, and go a long way towards promoting its growth, which in the end 
will only make Maine a more safe and healthy state through the practices learned in 
the gym.
