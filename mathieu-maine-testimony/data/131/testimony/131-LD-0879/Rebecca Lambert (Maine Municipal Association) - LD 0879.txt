 
 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association  
 
In Opposition To  
LD 879, An Act to Place Restrictions on Candidate Speech and Clothing, Buttons and Other Items 
at Voting Places  
 
March 15, 2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony neither for nor against  
LD 879 on behalf of Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For ref erence, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and 
establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Maine has come a long way from the early voting experiences when candidates and other 
citizens would attempt to influence the outcome of the election. This progression is  in part due 
to the laws in place that prohibit any interference with a  voter casting their ballot.  
While the LPC recognizes and appreciates that LD 879 is intended to help elections 
workers, there is also concern that this would turn our dedicated election workers into the 
fashion police when trying to decipher if an individual is there t o vote, or in fact loitering with the 
intention of influencing or agitating those with opposing political views.  Additionally, with the 
development of social media platforms, voters are bombarded with information about candidates leading up to the election and, generally speaking, have already decided who they 
will be voting for.  
The LPC, like the Maine Town & City Clerks Association, is neither for nor against LD 879.  
Thank you for  your time and for  considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
