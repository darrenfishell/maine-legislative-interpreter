Re: LD 879 – An Act to Place Restrictions  on Candidate  Speech  and Clothing,  Buttons  
and Other  Items  at Voting  Places
Position: Neither For Nor Against
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is neither for nor against LD 879 and we thank 
you for the opportunity to outline our points for your committee.
Although our members appreciate the spirit of this bill as it was intended to help election 
officials, concerns were raised as follows:
Confrontations between voters could result with political messages being worn on 
opposing sides of a candidate or issue, even if they aren’t “expressly advocating” for 
any candidate or issue
Items containing profanity would be worn, which may make voters uncomfortable 
(especially those who bring their children to the polls)
Election officials would have to decipher which people are there simply to vote, and 
which are lingering and would be in violation
Who will determine what is “expressly advocating” for a candidate or issue?  When it 
is left to the discretion of the election officials, inconsistencies will occur across the 
state.
Who will enforce this if there is a violation?  Clerks and election officials are 
increasingly wary of confronting voters on any issue or concern.
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association appreciates the opportunity to share its  
testimony with the Committee. Should any questions arise, please feel free to contact  me at 
207)680-4210 or by email: pdubois@waterville-me.gov .
