TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 921 
AN ACT TO ALLOW THE LOCAL FOODS FUND FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO BE USED FOR 
PROCESSED AND VALUE-ADDED MAINE FOOD PRODUCTS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 921. 
This bill recognizes that food grown in Maine also is processed. One example our legislative committees 
discussed was blueberry jam and jelly made from Maine blueberries. It has to be processed, but it is still local 
food. 
The language in the bill appropriately removes reference to minimally processed foods and the deﬁnition 
allows the fund to be used to purchase processed and value-added food products produced in Maine, within 
the revised deﬁnition. 
The bill directs the department to create standards for allowable processed and value-added Maine foods and 
provide guidance to school administrative units regarding which of those products are allowable for 
reimbursement.
