Testimony of Melanie Lagasse, Food Service Director for Valley Unified Education
Service Center consisting of Fort Kent, St. Agatha and Madawaska School Departments.
ln Support of LD 921
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Education and CulturalAffairs. My name is Melanie Lagasse. I am the Food
Service Director for Fort Kent, St. Agatha and Madawaska School Departments.
Today, I am submitting testimony in support of LD 921"An Act to Allow the Local Funds for
Public Schools to Be Used for Processed and Value-added Maine Food Products."
As a strong proponent of Farm to Schoolfor our children, I have worked with local farmers to
purchase cows to be taken to the slaughter house. As a matter of fact, I picked up my fresh
hamburger from 3 cows (one for each district) on Sunday. I purchase farm fresh eggs every
week for my districts on a rotating service. I purchase fresh berries and garden items when in
season. We believe in supporting our local farmers and businesses and Farm to School does
that.
I would like the committee to support this bill as the school lunch program provides much
needed meals for our students and we can support our local farmers and communities by being
allowed to expand the items that we purchase. Thank you Senator Rafferty, representative
Brennan and members of the Joint Standing Committee for your time and commitment to
Maine's children. lf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.
Melanie Lagasse
Food Service Director
