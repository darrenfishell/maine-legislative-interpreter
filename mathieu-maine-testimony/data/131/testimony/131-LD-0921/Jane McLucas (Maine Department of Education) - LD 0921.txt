Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee:  
LD 9 21, An Act to Allow the Local Foods Fund for Public Schools to Be Used for Processed and 
Value -added Maine Food Products , removes the minimally processed  delineation of food, to allow 
more processed local foods to qualify for reimbursement . 
The Local Food Fund is a reimbursement program that matches $1 for every $3 a school 
administrative unit  (SAU)  pays for produce, value -added dairy, protein  or minimally processed foods 
purchased directly from a farmer, farmers' cooperative, local food hub, local food processor or food 
service distributor in the State of Maine. Title 20 -A, §6602, subsection 12  addresses  the definition of 
minimally processed  food as related to the Local Food Fund . Currently, the definition  includes “only 
the washing, cleaning, trimming, peeling, slicing, drying, sorting, refrigerating, freezing and 
packaging of food items or a combination of those activities.”  
Allowing this expansion would give Maine students greater access  to food products made in Maine. 
For ins tance, a condiment like  salsa  would not cu rrently  qualify for the Local Food Fund 
reimbursement because it is a value -added product made in Maine.  Value -added products are raw 
agriculture products that have been modified or enhanced to have a higher market value and/or a 
longer shelf life. Some examples incl ude salsa, jams, and jerky.  Under the new provisions, items 
such as this may be purchased with this  Fund, thereby serving to deliver nutritious food to our 
students while continuing to support the local farmers and food manufacturers, vendors, and 
suppliers . 
This bill would expand the number  of products that could be used, thus expanding the use of the 
Fund and requiring  the Offi ce of Child Nutrition to define  new standards for the  Fund. Additionally, 
it should be noted the implementation of LD 921 may require some SAUs to incur additional costs by  
increasing billing, tracking, ordering , and  receiving of additional vendor s and suppliers.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information on LD 921 and respond to any 
questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Jane McLucas  
Director of Child Nutrition
