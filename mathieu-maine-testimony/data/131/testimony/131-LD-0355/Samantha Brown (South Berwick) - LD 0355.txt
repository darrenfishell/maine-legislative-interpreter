Samantha Brown
South Berwick
LD 355
Honorable members of the Veterans and Legal committee,  
My name is Samantha Brown from South Berwick, my daughter has been a cannabis 
patient since she was 2, she is now 11. Cannabis helps her tremendously with her 
seizures and quality of life. I have been an advocate for cannabis freedom since she 
started cannabis. 
I am neither for nor a agaisnt Ld 355
Bc I did not know exactly what this bill was until Senator Hickmans explanation this 
morning. 
The only thing I would really support is to dismantle the commission. 
It seems to be a waste of resources of at least time. It seems be served by people with 
political connections, and also of those whom it would serve financial gains.
Id donâ€™t want to see people who serve to financially hold this power over the 
legislature or the department. 
I support dismantling. 
Thank you
