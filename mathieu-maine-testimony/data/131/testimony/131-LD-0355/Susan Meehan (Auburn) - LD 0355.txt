Good morning Chairperson Hickman and Chairperson Supica and honorable members of the 
Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee. Welcome to the 131st Maine Legislature! My name is 
Susan Meehan, and I am a Registry Identification Cardholder in Maine's Medical Cannabis 
program, a former caregiver in Maine's Medical Cannabis program, and I am a Board member 
of the Maine Cannabis Coalition and the Cannabis Council of Maine. Today I testify in favor of 
LD355. 
I support complete revision of the Cannabis Advisory Committee to be composed of actual 
stakeholders in the Maine cannabis industry, people with actual experience in Maine's programs 
such as patient, consumer, Dispensary operators/owners, Caregiver, Caregiver 
Assistants/Registry identification Card Holder, manufacturing lab operator, adult use facility 
owners/operators, and parents of pediatric patients. These are the actual stakeholders in this 
rapidly evolving industry. 
With the "who" covered, this rapidly evolving element leads me to the "what." Perhaps a 
revamped, revitalized and directed Advisory Committee could take the lead on forming an 
effective Research grant process and practice as mandated by statute (Title 22, 558C, 2430, 
Section 5) and as addressed by two bills that are still in the Revisor's Office. The Advisory 
Committee could be charged with creating and vetting candidates to serve on a Cannabis 
Research Committee for example. This is a very important matter as by design the current 
Advisory Committee is a powerless and figure-head only committee. 
Thank-you for hosting this hearing.
