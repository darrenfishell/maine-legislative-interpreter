LD 1643
I am writing in opposition to LD 1643: “An Act Regarding Instructional Materials, 
Surveys, Analyses, Evaluations, and Events at Public Schools.”  This bill requires that
school administrators “make all instructional materials available for inspection by the 
parents or guardians of the children enrolled in a school of the school administrative 
unit.”  For inspection when?  For what purposes?  Is this for approval by parents?  
Also—when do parents not have access to instructional materials?  Why can’t they 
see the books their children bring home, or ask their child’s teacher if they are 
concerned?  This bill does not seem to add anything to the joint work of schools and 
parents to teach children, and therefore ought not to pass.
