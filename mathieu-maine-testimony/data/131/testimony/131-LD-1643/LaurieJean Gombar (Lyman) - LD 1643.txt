LD 1643
Senator Joseph Rafferty, Representative Michael Brennan and esteemed members of 
the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, I encourage you to vote ought to pass 
on LD1643.  I also support LD1129, LD1199.  Parents should be able to easily see 
what is being taught in schools.  The public should be able to see what is being taught 
in school easily as taxpayers.  Students should not be treated as data for mining, 
having to reveal details about themselves for analysis.  Please vote ought to pass on 
LD1643, LD1129, and LD1199.
