LD 51
I am writing in support of LD 51. 
This bill is not the creation of a new “right” but merely a reinstatement of rights that 
Mainers (and all Americans) had up until 2019. 
In my opinion, it is moral, practical and constitutional imperative that it is passed.
It is morally right because it recognizes the right of individual bodily autonomy and 
for a person to have a say in what substances are injected into their bodies with 
respect to their philosophical and religious beliefs.
It is also a practical necessity as Mainers (especially rural residents) are being denied 
access to health care because so many health care workers have left their professions 
rather than be forced into unwanted vaccines.  The results are a human toll of lack of 
medical care.
Finally, it is also a constitutional mandate in recognition of the religious rights 
granted by the First Amendment.
Thank you for considering my testimony.  LD 51 ought to pass.
