Sen. Rafferty, Rep. Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.  I’m Penny 
Morrell, taxpayer and citizen of the Town of Belgrade, Maine.   
I support LDs 51, 1098 and 1209. 
The 1st Amendment to the Constitution gives us the freedom to exercise our religion 
without interference from our government.  The separation of church and state clause by 
Thomas Jefferson was intended to keep government out of the church.  That is part of 
what the new world was about, immigrants seeking freedom from government 
interference in their worship of God.   
There is no more important place for this freedom to exist than in the education and 
welfare of our children.  Parents must maintain the right to decide what vaccinations they 
want to allow students to receive.  After all, they remain responsible for the outcomes 
ultimately and are the guardians of their health.    
I urge this committee to vote “ought to pass” on LDs 51, 1098 and 1209.  Thank you.

1148, An Act to Prohibit COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates for Students Enrolled in Public

Sen. Rafferty, Rep. Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.  I’m Penny 
Morrell, taxpayer and citizen of the Town of Belgrade, Maine.   
I support LDs. 869, 1148 and 1228. 
We are learning every day more and more about the harm COVID-19 immunizations have 
inflicted on our kids.  Myocarditis is one among others.  Science is telling us children do 
not need the COVID-19 vax because their immune system is more than capable of 
fighting off the virus.  Therefore, it is understandable that parents are asking their 
lawmakers to speak for them and stop this mandate of unnecessary and potentially 
harmful vaccinations requirement in order to attend schools. 
I urge this committee to vote “ought to pass” on LDs 869, 1148 and 1228.  Thank you.
