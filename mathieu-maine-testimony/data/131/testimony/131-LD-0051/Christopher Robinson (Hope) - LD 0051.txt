LD 51
Dear Honorable Members of This Committee
I am writing in support of LD 51 An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical 
Exemptions to Immunization Requirements. 
   
My parents met as a result of WWII.  My mother suffered under Hitler’s regime.  Her 
family lost everything to the Nazis.  She was 6’1 and weighed only 115lbs when she 
met my father, an American translator at the Nuremburg Trials.  Their stories had a 
big impact on my life and philosophy.
The Nuremburg principles and the US Constitution clearly state that certain rights are 
unconditional, such as “Informed Consent”.   No one has the right to force anything 
on another human being, especially when they tell us it’s for our own good.
Despite having grown up in Europe, a good job in an international company, a family 
I loved, and close friends, I felt claustrophobic there.  Our lives were so controlled.  
At age 30, I chose liberty over security and moved to Maine.  I never imagined that, 
in the US, I might someday have to choose between forced immunization and my job,
attending school, healthcare, participating in certain public events, and travel.    Now I
know something of how my mother felt living under Hitler.  Is this healthcare tyranny
the beginning of something more nefarious to come?  
Please support LD 51 and restore our freedom to choose.
