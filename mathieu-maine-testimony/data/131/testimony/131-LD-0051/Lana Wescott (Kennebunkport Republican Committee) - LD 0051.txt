LD 51
April 1, 2023 
Dear Members of the Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,  
We encourage you to support and pass LD 51, an act to restore the religious and 
philosophical exemptions to immunization requirements to all Mainers. At the core of
Maine’s founding, freedom was the uniting and driving force.  We stood firm in our 
convictions that humanity mattered, regardless of what others may have thought at the
time.  In applying those same principles today, we ought to restore the right to bodily 
integrity. This means that all decisions about our body – what goes in and what goes 
out – should remain in the hands of the individual and not the government, nor 
employer, nor daycare or school institution. All Mainers have the right to bodily 
autonomy, and medical decisions should remain a PERSONAL choice.  
We stand proud to support this opportunity across party lines! Please take this 
opportunity to UNITE Mainers of all colors, ages, cultures and religions in this 
unifying effort to restore their rights to religious and philosophical exemptions. 
PLEASE VOTE THAT LD 51 'OUGHT TO PASS.'
Sincerely,
Members of the Kennebunkport Republican Committee (954 Maine Residents)
