LD 51
Good morning my name is Stephanie and I have been in health care for eight years. 
Let me begin by saying that I have always opposed LD 798 when it was passed in 
2019. I was concerned about the potential implications that might come from it.  Even
in my wildest imagination I could not foresee the consequences it would bring.  As 
act technologist I must get informed consent from my patients in order to administer a
contrast agent that has been approved by the FDA. Everyday I work I am proud to 
serve my patients and support their choice to go through the exam or not. You cannot 
begin to imagine how disheartening it is to now work for an organization that does not
allow me the same right.  The passing of LD 798 means I have to say yes to every 
vaccine that my employer deems necessary no matter my concerns or religious 
beliefs.  If I say no I loose my job, the means I have to take care of my family and the 
profession I love.  The vaccine mandate has made healthcare loose many great 
workers and these people have not been replaced. COVID-19 has allowed us to see 
how dangerous vaccine mandates are and we have the opportunity to make it right. 
Now the fear of COVID has passed  we can look at things more clearly and ask, is it 
right to have someone loose their job, for a child to be denied an education because 
they are not comfortable getting an experimental vaccine? Please make the right steps 
in reversing this mistake and pass LD 51. Thank you for your time
Stephanie
