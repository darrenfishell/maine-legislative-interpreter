By Sarah Quirk of Bangor  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee,  
My name is Sarah Quirk.  I live in Bangor and am requesting your  support  of LD 51, LD 869, LD 1098, LD 
1148, LD 1209, and LD 1228 . 
As parents to two school aged children, my husband and I  believe that ALL children in our state deserve 
equal access to educational opportunities . We desire a strong, quality education for our children.  We 
both attended Bangor Schools and choose to live in Bangor for the District’s excellent educational 
programs and extracurricular activities. Since the removal of immunization exemptions, our children are 
no longer able to attend the school  they love, participate in school activities, sports,  or extracurricular 
activities to further enrich their educational experience.  
 
LD 51, 86, 1098, 1148, 1209, and 1228 will expand access to educational opportunities for ALL Maine 
students and provide e quality at public  and private schools and universities.  Additionally, o ur stat e’s 
educational inst itution s are struggling financially,  and this is one way to boost enrollment  and tuition 
dollars  while ensuring a ll Maine students are able to access all educational opportunities.  
 
Maine is our home, and our family is involved in many aspects of our community here.  However, if 
additional educational options are not expanded for our children, we will be forced to move from this  
community and the state we love to seek other opportunities.
