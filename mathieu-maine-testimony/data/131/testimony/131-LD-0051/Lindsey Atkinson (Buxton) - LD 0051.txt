LD 51
I am in strong support of this legislation.  Our two children have been removed from 
their school as a result of LD 798.  We have sincere religious and philosophical 
reasons for choosing not to fully vaccinate, along with various health concerns over 
safety and efficacy.  We truly believe that our children are entitled to a free and public
education, as stated in the Maine State Constitution; however that right has been 
stripped from them.  As a result, we have been forced to homeschool, leaving our 
family financially vulnerable and our children disconnected from their peers.  Please, 
we implore you to consider reinstating religious and philosophical exemptions for 
vaccine requirements.  Our children have been wrongfully targeted as a result of these
draconian measures.
