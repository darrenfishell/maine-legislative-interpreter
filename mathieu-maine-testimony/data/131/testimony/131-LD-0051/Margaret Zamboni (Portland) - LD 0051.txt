LD 51
Dear Honorable Members of the Joint Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Maggie Zamboni, I am a resident of Portland, I am a practicing 
pediatrician in South Portland, and I was raised in Milo.  I'm writing to strongly 
encourage you to OPPOSE LDs 51, 1098 and 1209. 
High immunization rates are tremendously important for community health and 
safety.  Removing the philosophical and religion exemptions from Maine vaccine 
requirements was an incredibly valuable shift in the law.  Our vaccination rates have 
improved and our communities are safer.  The public overwhelmingly supported this 
effort.  All major medical organizations supported this effort.  
I would kindly ask that you lean on medical experts for your information, as you 
consider these bills.  Thank you for your time and consideration of this very important
topic.
