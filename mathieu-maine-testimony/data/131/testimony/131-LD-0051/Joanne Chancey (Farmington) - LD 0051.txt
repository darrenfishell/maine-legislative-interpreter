To Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and the Members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs,
I am testifying in support of ME LD 51, LD 1098, LD 869, LD 1148, LD 1209, 
LD1228
I am in favor of restoring religious and philosophical exemptions to immunization 
requirements for work and for education.  As a healthcare professional, I can see that 
the mandates have caused much harm to the healthcare professions by reducing 
available professional workers and staff.   Vaccine mandates have not been shown to 
improve the health of Maine people.  Instead the mandates have driven a wedge of 
distrust among the government, healthcare professionals and Maine citizens.
As a Christian, the vaccine mandates are directly discriminating against my free 
exercise of religion in Maine in regards to education and work opportunities.  
The vaccine mandates have caused suffering for Mainers across the board of 
healthcare and education with no measurable benefits.  Religious freedom and 
philosophical exemptions must be restored to Maine citizens.
Sincerely,
Joanne Chancey, DC
Farmington, Maine
