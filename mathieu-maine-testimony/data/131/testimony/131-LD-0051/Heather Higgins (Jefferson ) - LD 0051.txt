LD 51
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD 51.
My husband and I have 3 grade school age children and we are Christians and wish to
have our religious exemptions back. We feel we should have equal rights to public 
school! Maine recently became 1 of only 6 states in the United States that has taken 
away our religious and philosophical exemptions and we feel this isn’t constitutional 
or humane!  
We deeply desire to keep our children in public school & have our choice on what we 
put in our children’s bodies! Philosophically, there are new vaccines like the Covid 
vaccine that has not had near enough time for long-term side effects to show, and we 
feel it’s a very slippery slope to not have the choice on these is they have now been 
added to the recommended schedule for children! I thank you for your time and 
asking the committee to please vote “ ought to pass” on LD 51
