Re: Stop the mandates
Dear Cheryl Chapman,
Dear members of Maine's Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, Please 
support LDs 51, 869, 1098, 1148, 1209 and 1228 this session. These bills would 
restore religious and philosophical
 exemptions to vaccines and prevent COVID-19 vaccination requirements in Maine's 
public and private school systems, protecting education access for all children in 
Maine. Maine and national public health officials lied and misled the public during 
the COVID-19
 pandemic about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Today, the data are clear that 
COVID-19 poses little risk to school-aged children, and this population has little to 
benefit from COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, the authorized COVID-19 vaccines 
do not stop
 people from contracting the disease or transmitting it to others. Despite these facts, 
public health officials used fear and panic to cajole education institutions to mandate 
these products on staff and students. This should never be allowed to happen again.
 Implementing a mandate today is akin to kicking tens of thousands of students out of 
Maine's education system. Please learn from the mistakes of the pandemic and 
support LDs 51, 869, 1098, 1148, 1209, and 1228 this session. Thank you.
Sincerely,
L. Merrill
