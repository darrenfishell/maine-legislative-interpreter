As a taxpayer, I am in furious that my child is ineligible to attend public school even 
though I pay an exorbitant amount of money for the school system. 
He is being discriminating against based on our religious beliefs. As his parents, we 
have the right to make decisions on his behalf. We are educated and well versed in 
this topic and have chosen not to vaccine. My husband is a doctor and I have my BA 
degree. However, I should not have to divulge that personal information to anyone to 
be able to make this decision. I especially should not have to live in fear because of 
such decisions, all while being financially obligated to pay for a service through my 
taxes that I am not eligible to use because of my religious beliefs.
This has clearly been a violation of our constitutional rights by the state of Maine. We
are currently exploring relocation options if things do not change and our rights are 
not restored.
