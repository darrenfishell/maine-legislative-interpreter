LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee.
I am asking you to vote ought to pass on LD 51.
My name is Holly Aguilo.  I am a registered nurse since 1982. I am here to speak on 
behalf of my grandchildren.  My daughter married a man whose sister had a severe 
reaction  after receiving vaccines during her first year of life.  These reactions caused 
severe swelling in her brain.  Her head swelled so much that when she tried to stand, 
she would fall over. Everyone who saw her said, “ what is wrong with her head”.  The
doctors even considered putting in a brain shunt to drain the fluid from her head.  The 
mother knew the vaccines caused this brain swelling and stopped vaccinating these 4 
children.  She and her husband later had 4 more children, none of whom are 
vaccinated.  She has said that the second set of 4 children are healthier, better behaved
and learn differently than the first set of 4 children.  All the children are 
homeschooled.  The second set are now all young adults who are prevented from 
attending college, online education, and vocational programs in the state of Maine due
to their vaccine status.  
My daughter and son-in-law have 3 children, none are vaccinated due to their 
concerns of  what  happened to  his sister could happen to their children.
I am requesting that the philosophical and religious exemption options to vaccination 
be reinstated so my grandchildren and their aunts and uncles can attend higher 
education options like college, online learning and vocational programs here in the 
state of Maine.
Again, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD 51.
Thank you
