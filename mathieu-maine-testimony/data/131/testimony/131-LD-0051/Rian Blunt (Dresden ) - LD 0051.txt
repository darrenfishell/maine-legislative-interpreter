To whom it may concern, 
Restoring these exemptions would allow access to local school sports and enrichment 
opportunities for all students in Maine.  I have experienced this lack of opportunity 
and isolation first hand.  My family has been forced to leave the state so that we may 
persu a better education.  Restoring these exemptions would allow my family to 
remain in this state so that we may have equal access to education.
