LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD 51.
I have lived in Maine for roughly twenty years. I transplanted in 2002 with my first 
two young children and then had a third home borne Maine baby. Thank you for 
upholding that level of medical freedom. 
Flash forward to my eldest as a June 2019 high school graduate. Soon, she will 
graduate Husson University having pushed through the covid era by submitting to 
vaccines in order to achieve her goals. My middle child graduated early during covid 
via remote schooling because he was set to be denied senior year by LD 798. He’s 
now missing out of the community college offerings because of his health choices but
is working full time. My youngest had middle school interrupted by covid and then 
was removed entirely his 8th grade year. He attended middle school graduation to 
support his life long friends as an audience member.  He went as a guest to 
homecoming last fall with his now freshmen group, but homeschooling is difficult, 
especially when ostracized from the woodshop program that he enjoyed just because 
it’s on school grounds. 
Aside from my personal difficulties navigating all of that as a single mom, the essence
of this issue remains personal choice. It is recognizing the humanity in each person 
and allowing for freedom of bodily integrity. In this circumstance all I can say is that 
parents do what they do and it’s the children who have been punished here. 
I am concerned at the level of discrimination from this egregiously contrived 
legislation. Admit the mistake. Right the wrong. Return students to schools. Allow 
families to prosper with opportunities and connect again with their school community.
LD 51 ought to pass. 
Thank you.
