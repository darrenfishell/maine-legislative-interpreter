LD 51
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, 
I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD 51, and restore religious and 
philosophical exemptions for students, and certain healthcare facilities  My 3 
school-aged children (elementary and middle school) were not directly impacted by 
LD798 because they were up to date on the required immunizations.  However, I 
would have been fired from my engineering job of 20 years if my employer had not 
allowed religious exemptions for the Covid-19 vaccine.  Up until the Covid-19 
vaccine requirement, I was an employee in very good standing.  Even though I was 
eventually allowed to keep my job, the way I was treated by my employer during that 
time had a profound impact on my career, my mental health, and my physical health.  
I would have lost my income and the health insurance for my family.  I have always 
believed that any family should be allowed to decide what immunizations are right for
them.  No child should be barred from an education in Maine due to their personal 
medical history.  No person should be barred from working in Maine due to their 
personal medical history.  The fact that both of these things have happened in Maine 
has caused me to lose any trust that I had in our Government.  There is not a 
one-size-fits-all solution.  I am asking you to truly consider if LD798 accomplished 
what it was designed to do?  What effect did it have on Maine people?  Should our 
Government be able to dictate what medications we put in our body without 
exception?  I urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD51.  Thank you for your time.
