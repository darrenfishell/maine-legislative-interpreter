Dear Chairman Joseph Rafferty and Michael Brennan  an all committee members, 
 
My name is Luanne Mageles. 
 
I work in the healthcare field, I did not want to be forced into a vaccine that I did not want to take. The 
COVID vaccine I was backed into the corner as I need my income and health benefits! If I had the option 
I would of left the state of Maine! So I had to go against how I felt about this vaccine. I must let you 
know that  I have 2 children and they have all the vaccines that the CDC recommends. 
I will Refuse to vaccinate them for COVID the vaccine!  
 
My son who was born in 2009 and was completely vaccinated with all his vaccines, when he was 10 
years old he got Whooping cough! I was so worried about his best friend who I know does not get any 
vaccines. These boys were together every single day! My son coughed for months!! We all got re 
vaccinated and had to be treated for it just in case. Guess what?? His best friend and family NEVER got 
Whooping cough!!  
 
So I looked into the Whooping cough numbers to see who is actually getting it… 
This is what I found… 
 
Pertussis in Vaccinated Individuals* 
 
2018- 84% of vaccinated  
2019- 95% of vaccinated 
2020- 90% vaccinated     
2021 100% vaccinated 
 
So who is contracting Pertussis??? The Vaccinated!! 
 
I feel that individuals should be able to CHOOSE to do what they want with Their bodies, after all My 
Body, My Choice! I read it back the in the 80’s! 
Many good families are leaving and have left Maine because of this ridiculous law! It is time to change 
it! 
So Please do the right thing for the state of Maine and support  LD 51 and LD 1098
