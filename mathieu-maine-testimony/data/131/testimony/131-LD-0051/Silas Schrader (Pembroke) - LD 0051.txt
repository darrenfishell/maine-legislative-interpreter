Silas Schrader
Pembroke
LD 51
Sen. Rafarty, Rep. Brennan, and Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee.
My name is Silas Schrader, and I am from Pembroke, Maine.
I am testifying in support of LD51. Since LD798 was passed, my brother, who was 
attending the University of Maine in Orono at the time, was suddenly unable to finish 
his education. This is because LD798 removes the right to religious and philosophical
exemptions. When my brother started his education to earn a degree in mechanical 
engineering, like many of his peers, he thought it would be up to him to work hard 
and get his degree. However, because of LD798 removing his right to religious and 
philosophical exemptions, he found out that it was actually up to other powers outside
of his control.
I also wanted to go to trade school, I was told we need more electricians. However, 
LD798 tells me otherwise. Since it was passed, I am not allowed to attend trade 
school.
The damage of LD798 has already been done, I am asking the committee to right their
wrongs by reinstating LD51, which will give us back our religious and philosophical 
exemptions.
Thank you.
