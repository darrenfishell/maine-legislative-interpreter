LD 51
Chair and Members of this Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to support passage of LD 51. When the People of 
Maine created the trust indenture that is our State Constitution we did not relinquish 
our natural rights to determine our private health affairs to our government servants.  
In fact, those that serve are bound by oath to protect our private rights.  The removal 
of philosophical objections to immunizations was an unlawful act, per the Maine 
Constitution.  Passage of LD 51 corrects this treasonous harm to the People and 
establishes honor to the oath each of you have taken to honor the Maine Constitution. 
It is your duty to support passage of this bill.  Thank you.
