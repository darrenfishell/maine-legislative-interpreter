I am one of the many people who lost their jobs back in 2021 when the Governor of 
this state decided to issue a vaccine mandate on all medical care personnel, regardless 
of the job type. I am a strong advocate that any medical treatment is a personal choice
and should come down to the individual and their doctor to make any type of 
decision. Never should medicine be treated as a one-size fits. When we deny a person 
their civil liberties we are going against the constitution upon which this country was 
built. This is very dangerous enforcement, medically, physically, and emotionally,  to 
place on any person or persons regardless of the current situations going on in the 
world. All medical treatment needs to remain a personal decision. Thank you
