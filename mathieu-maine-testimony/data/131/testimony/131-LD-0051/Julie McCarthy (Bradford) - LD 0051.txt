LD 51
In regard to LD 51, I am for restoring religious and philosophical exemptions. It is 
egregious that people are forced to choose between their career, or getting a vaccine. 
There are extenutaing circumstances and various reasons why people may decide 
against it. Who are we to decide and demand?  You are causing potential harm 
physically and mentally when you think you know what's best for the health and 
safety of all individuals not to mention, adversely impacting health care workers. 
Who would want to enter into that field today? It might be covid shots today, but what
will it be tomorrow? They can add whatever they choose to the schedule and people 
will have to submit or face job loss. Governor Mills can add Covid shots to the 
vaccination schedule for school admittance and then what will parents whose children
attend public school do? Sad world we are living in when medical freedoms are being 
trampled on so severely.
