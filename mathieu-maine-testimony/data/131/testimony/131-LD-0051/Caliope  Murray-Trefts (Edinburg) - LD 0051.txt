Caliope  Murray-Trefts
Edinburg
LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD51. 
Hello, my name is Caliope Murray-Trefts. I am 12 years old and in 7th grade. Since 
not being allowed to go to public school since 2021, I have lost all of my friends, have
not been able to do sports for school, and have not been able to do things like band. 
While I was in public school, I was a grade higher in spelling, and I was really good 
at reading. Since being homeschooled, it has become harder to learn because it's not 
always hands on, and I don't have a teacher right there to help me. I have to do school 
online while my mom is at work. 
I now have a lot of social anxiety because I am not used to being in crowds or around 
people. I didn't ever feel this way when I was in school. 
My whole life I have always wanted to be in middle school and be able to use lockers.
I have also wanted to go to school dances and be able to do school sports. Because of 
LD798, I have missed out on so many things and it makes me very sad to think about 
it. 
I hope that I am able to have a chance to be in middle school. Two of my sisters have 
lost their high school experience, so I am hoping that I will be able to have mine. 
I am asking you to please vote ought to pass on LD51.
