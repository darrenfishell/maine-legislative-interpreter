To Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
Please reinstate the religious and philosophical exemptions to immunization 
requirements for school students and healthcare workers.
I have a sincere religious belief, but had my religious exemption and appeal denied by
my hospital employer for the covid vaccine which was mandated by the state and 
Gov. Mills  for all health care providers by 10/24/21.
Under extreme duress, I took a covid shot to not lose my nursing career and job and 
means to support my family.   It was traumatic to be forced to take a shot I was 
against because of the HEK aborted fetus cell line used in testing and production of 
covid shots, or lose my income.  It was against my sincere religious belief. It was 
against my civil rights.  Sincere religious beliefs should be respected !!!
