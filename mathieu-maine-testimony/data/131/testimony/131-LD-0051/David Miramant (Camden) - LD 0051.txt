Good morning Sen. Rafferty, Rep. Pierce and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. 
My name is Dave Miramant and I live in Camden. 
Those of you who served with me when I was in the Senate know of my passion for 
this issue and the time I have spent researching it. The results of that research have 
proven that the allowance of a religious or philosophical exemption to the vaccine 
requirements in our schools had not caused any problems in the over 30 years that it 
was in place. 
In the absence of evidence that the lack of vaccination in children causes problems, it 
makes sense to correct a wrong that was done several years ago when the exemptions 
were removed. 
We have only to look at our neighbor, New Hampshire, to see that allowing these 
exemptions does not affect the health of our schools. They have continued to allow 
exemptions and have no issues with this. This is the case in many other states and 
undermines any argument that it makes sense to force vaccinations to receive a public
education.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
