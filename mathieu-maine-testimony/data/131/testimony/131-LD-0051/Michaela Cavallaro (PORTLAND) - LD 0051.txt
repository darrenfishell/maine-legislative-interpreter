LD 51
Dear Honorable Members of the Joint Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Michaela Cavallaro, and my daughter and I live in Portland. I am writing 
to oppose LD 51 and its companion bills. Mainers have already decided these issues 
during the 2019 referendum, which included support from our leading healthcare 
organizations. And the vote was unambiguous: 72% of voters, including a wide 
majority in every one of our 16 counties, opted to protect public health by eliminating
loopholes in our vaccine laws related to school attendance. 
As a result, more kids are now protected from deadly diseases -- something that the 
pandemic has shown us is incredibly important. I urge you to vote "ought not to pass" 
on LD 51 and the other bills under consideration.
Thank you!
