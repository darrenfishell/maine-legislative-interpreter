   
Dear Respective Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, 
 
I am giving testimony today as a Maine resident and retired servicemember of the U.S. Army. 
After serving 22 years of honorable service in the armed forces with 33 months deployed 
overseas in combat, to say that I was dismayed to learn of LD729, would be an understatement. 
When my wife told me that a law had been passed where I and my children would not be able to 
attend school because of our religious convictions. I was devastated. I was ashamed to call 
myself a Maine resident. After moving my family around the country for 17 years to support the 
nation, we were finally going to be able to come home. A home that was permanent. Where our 
family and support system had been forged and bred. A familiar place that my wife and I were 
both raised and were looking forward to raising our two children. This opportunity of a life that 
we were eager to begin was stolen from us by the passing of an unconstitutional law. A law that 
divided those American Maine residents who wished to practice their religious beliefs without 
fear of reprisal and fearful individuals who saw fit to deny such beliefs. I am here today in 
support of LD51. I am here today as a warrior that has fought many battles. I will continue to 
fight for the freedom of religion and against oppression without the uniform. I will continue to 
fight so that other families like mine can live in a state they once called home. Pass LD51 and 
give the freedom of religion and education back to our children. Donâ€™t make them have to fight 
for a God given right.    
 
SFC (Ret). J.J. Brown
