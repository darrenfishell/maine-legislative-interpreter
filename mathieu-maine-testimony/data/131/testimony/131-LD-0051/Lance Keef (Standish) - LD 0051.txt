LD 51
I am in support of LD 51 to restore religious and philosophical exemptions to immunizations 
mandates.
We the people should never be required to inject into our bodies any foreign substance and 
especially for children to attend public schools or colleges.  This shouldn't have passed in the 
first place as the state was at 95% compliance with immunizations anyhow. It was nothing 
more than a way for the drug companies to try and make more money.
Many people have medical issues that a vaccine could cause adverse effects.
