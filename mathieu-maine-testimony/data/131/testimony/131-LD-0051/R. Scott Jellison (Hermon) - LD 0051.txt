An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical Exemptions to Immunization 
Requirements
HP26/LD51
HP693/LD1098
HP769/LD1209
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs:
Greetings:  I am writing in support of the above listed bills returning religious and 
philosophical exemptions to immunization.  I understand the intent is to protect the 
population against many different infections and transmition of sickness.  After all the
miss information on covid 19 both from public but more importantly from the 
government, it should be left up to the individual as to the risk management of their 
lives and family.  
We are now beginning to deal with the fall out of the results of covid 19 
immunizations that have adversely affect people and altered or ended their lives.  Not 
all government information will ever be revealed to the public for obvious reasons of 
the adverse effects from the shots.
We need to return to a normal and sane world of reality.  We lack professionals who 
have worked most of their lives and been let go from their jobs because they refused 
the jab.  There are Doctors, nurses, fire fighters, police and many others.  I work in 
the real world where we were not affected by these requirements and are the 
beneficiary of having these professionals having to come here to work.
Letâ€™s bring back some sanity to the world.  Please vote ought to pass on these bills 
and the other related bills coming to your committee at this time. 
Thank you for your consideration and time.
