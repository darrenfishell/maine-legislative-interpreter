LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education & Cultural 
Affairs Committee, 
 I am testifying in SUPPORT of L.D. 51, L.D. 869, L.D. 1098, L.D. 1148, L.D. 1209, 
and L.D. 1228. 
I am a single mother to an 8 year old child and work full time as an Associate 
Director. When LD798 passed, our world was turned upside down. My daughter is 
missing two doses of a vaccine that she had a severe adverse reaction to as a baby. I 
fought for 5 years to get a medical exemption and was repeatedly denied without 
good reason.
 My daughter was able to attend public Pre-K and Kindergarten with a philosophical 
exemption in place up until LD798 passed. Once that bill passed, she was segregated 
from her peers due to missing two doses of a vaccine. 
Keeping my child safe was my top priority and always will be. I was forced to 
homeschool because of LD798. We are 3 years into this exhausting journey. As a 
single mother, who works full time to provide for her child while simultaneously 
homeschooling, I can tell you for certain that LD798 hurt our lives in a multitude of 
ways. Not only our lives, but it negatively impacted thousands of other families in the 
state of Maine. Our children deserve a right to public education and shouldnâ€™t be 
segregated from their peers because of religion, personal beliefs or adverse reactions. 
Thank you for reading my testimony.
