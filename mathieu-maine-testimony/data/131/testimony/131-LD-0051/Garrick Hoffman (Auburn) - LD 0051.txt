Hello,
I am an Auburn resident. I urge you to pass this bill to allow religious & philosophical
exemptions to immunization requirements.
In 2021, a friend of mine lost her job as a nurse - one of the essential jobs that people 
held in reverence during the pandemic - because of her religious, personal choice to 
not get vaccinated against COVID-19. Religious & philosophical exemptions have 
*always* been allowed, including at universities, and not allowing so is despotic, 
unreasonable and forceful.
Now that we know the COVID-19 vaccines hardly reduce transmission - if they even 
do at all - not allowing religious & philosophical exemptions to immunization 
requirements is even more sinister.
Thank you for your time.
