LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education & Cultural 
Affairs Committee, I am testifying in support of LD 51.
The passage of LD 798 in 2019 signified an end of opportunity for my family. My 
eight-year-old son is autistic. He currently attends public school, which has helped his
developmental progress tremendously. He is only able to be present at school because
of the IEP exemption that was included in LD 798. After seeing how much school has
helped his treatment, I cannot help but worry about children with new IEPâ€™s who are 
excluded from the current special education exemption. It strikes me as being legally 
inconsistent from a disability-rights perspective to only allow exemptions for children
who had existing individual education plans and exemptions on file prior to 2021. All 
special-needs children deserve access to education. 
My daughter was born in 2020. Having a sibling with autism, I would prefer her to 
have an individualized vaccine schedule based on a fully informed genetic profile. 
Because of this, my daughter will not be allowed to receive any institutional 
education in the state of Maine for the entirety of her life. This also means that my 
work choices are severely restricted. My family would deeply benefit from having 
two full-time working adults. With an intense need for employees across multiple 
industries state-wide, the LD 798 mandate continues to keep people like me out of the
workforce. 
LD 51 would help bolster the Maine workforce. It would also provide a path to a 
better future for families like mine. 
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Sarah Bohan, LMT
