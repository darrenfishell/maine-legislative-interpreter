LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee,  I am asking you today to vote yes on LD 51 and all the related bills.
I am a mother to 4 children. Two grown, and two still at home. Since the passage of 
LD 798 my two youngest children have turned school age. Because of our sincerely 
held religious and philosophical beliefs we do not vaccinate our children. Our 
children are excluded from sports, music, band, drama and many other opportunities 
that even as homeschoolers we could participate in when we had exemptions. I am 
confident in my abilities as a parent to very successfully educate my children. 
However as a low income family I am not able to offer my children many of the 
enrichment opportunities that they could have participated in with the public school. 
The removal of exemptions disproportionately affects lower income Mainers, as I am 
not able to privately afford to supplement my childrens education with activities that 
are free to publicly educated students. Religious discrimination is wrong. Segregating 
children based on their private medical information is wrong. Please right this wrong, 
and vote yes on LD 51, and all the related bills. Thank you for your thoughtful 
consideration.
