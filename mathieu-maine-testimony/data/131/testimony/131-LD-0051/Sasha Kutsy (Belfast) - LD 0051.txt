LD 51
I do not want my name to be used in any publications.
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you to vote ought to pass on LD 51.
Since the removal of the religious exemption to vaccines in 2019, my family has been
denied many services that our tax money pays for.  As homeschooled children, my 
kids were looking forward to taking classes at the high school and the alternative 
education school.  My son loves technology and was excited about classes at the 
Waldo Technical School.  My daughter is an athlete and she has not been allowed to 
participate in any of the public school’s sports.  She has been asked to join the 
competitive cheering team, the soccer team, and the track team and has cried each 
time she had to tell the coaches that she was not able to get involved.  A religious 
exemption would allow her to stay true to our faith and to also pursue her passion for 
sports. 
We had been looking forward to staying in Maine as my children attend state 
colleges.  At this time, they can not take early college classes and have no hope of 
going to college in the state.   They have also been asked to leave the summer camp 
that they attend for years.  This state has become a very sad place for them since the 
removal of the religious exemption and we will need to move in the near future.
It amazes me that the “my body, my choice” feeling does not extend to our personal 
and private medical choices.  I urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD51.
Thank you for your time and heartfelt consideration,
