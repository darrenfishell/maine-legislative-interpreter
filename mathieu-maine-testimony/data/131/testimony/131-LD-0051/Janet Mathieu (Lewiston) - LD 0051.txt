LD 51
I support LD51 to restore religious and philosophical exemptions to immunization 
requirements.  I am unemployed and locked out of my healthcare profession because I
was forced to choose between the c19 shot or lose my livelihood.  Religious 
exemptions were denied without review and Title VII was completely ignored.  
Choosing medical freedom and bodily autonomy is a choice granted with adhering to 
the tenets of our constitution.  Anything less is tyranny.  
Children by the age of 18 years old have a total of 79 vaccines.  Now 1 of 35 children 
have autism.  Coincidence?  We need to protect our children from this scandalous 
agenda.  Thank you!
