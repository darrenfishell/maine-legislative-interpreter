LD 51
Committee Members, I ask that you restore the religious and philosophical 
exemptions for both students and certain healthcare facilities by voting to reinstating 
LD 51. 
If a person's religious beliefs, conflict with the vaccine mandate, I believe that is 
sufficient reason to allow an exemption. 
Many students have been prevented from furthering their education when their 
religious or philosophical beliefs prevent them from taking the Covid Vaccine. Many 
colleges would not allow students to continue or begin their studies unless they were 
vaccinated.  Passing LD 51 would allow those individuals to pursue their education. I 
would hope that you would do what you can to assure that government mandates do 
not prevent anyone from pursuing his or her education. 
Not mandating the Covid immunization would not in any way interfere with the 
current immunization requirements. Passing LD 51 would allow those with religious 
or philosophical objections to make the decision that best aligns with their religious or
philosophical beliefs. 
Allowing religious and philosophical exemptions should be reinstated as they were 
deemed appropriate and workable before the onset of Covid.
