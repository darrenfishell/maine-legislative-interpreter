Dear Honorable Members of the Joint Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs: 
 
My name is Charles Frost a pharmacist living in Paris, Maine.  I am also licensed to administer 
vaccines and volunteered to give Covid vaccinations during the height of the pandemic.  I am writing 
to you to express my opposition the LD 51 and its related bills 
Immunizations are recognized around the world as important tools for the control of certain infectious 
diseases.  They are so important that in the United States pharmacists have been added to the list of 
healthcare professionals who are authorized to administer vaccines.  This was done to increase 
access to them. 
Immunizing both children and adults is a public health effort to control not only highly contagious 
infectious diseases but also prevent infections that may only affect an individual such as rabies, 
tetanus, and shingles. 
Immunizing children not only protects them from highly contagious diseases but it also protects those 
who are unable to benefit from vaccines due to medical conditions.  To allow childhood vaccinations 
to fall below the accepted levels considered necessary to protect the entire population is a public 
health mistake.   
I also believe that vaccines have proven to be the single most significant medical advancements in 
disease prevention.  To place restrictions on their use under “Emergency Use Authorization” is a 
mistake and extremely short sighted. 
I ask that you consider the strength of immunization benefits and vote “ought not to pass” on LD51 
and the other bills under consideration with it. 
Thank you for your time and care in consideration of this very important health issue. 
 
Yours truly, 
 
Charles B. Frost, PharmD
