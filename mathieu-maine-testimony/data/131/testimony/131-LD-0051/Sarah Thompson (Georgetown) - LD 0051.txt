Sarah Thompson
Georgetown
LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, esteemed members of the Committee:
My name is Sarah Thompson, I am a parent living in Georgetown, and I am testifying
in support of LD51.
My testimony is very simple. My children are 17 and 13, and without the restoration 
of these exemptions, they will not be attending any post-secondary educational 
institutions in the state of Maine. We have seen many bitter divisions arise in our 
communities and lead to ostracization and exclusion of children and families, without 
demonstrating any measurable net benefit in health outcomes, over the issue of 
vaccination. 
We all love Maine and want it to be, truly, the Way Life Should Be. And that way 
should include ALL children, regardless of ethnic or religious background, having 
access to the education system without compromising their deeply held personal and 
cultural convictions. 
Please Right This Wrong.
Thank you for your consideration and please vote "Ought to Pass" on LD51.
