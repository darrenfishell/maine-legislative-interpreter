LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD 51. Due to the removal
of religious and philosophical exemptions my 9 year old is now being educated in 
Mexico.  The removal of exemptions is placing undue emotional, mental and financial
hardship on my daughter and our family.  I am separated from my child as I need to 
work in Maine and she cannot attend school here.  As a US citizen and a resident of 
Maine, I believe it is my right to be able to follow my firmly held religious, spiritual 
and philosophical beliefs and that my rights of religious/philosophical freedom as 
well as parental rights be upheld by my government.  I do not support or trust a 
government that believes they know more about what is healthy for my child than I 
do.  Please reinstate religious and philosophical exemptions so that the children 
negatively impacted by LD798 may return to their rightful education.  
Sincerely,
Jennifer Morgan-Binns
