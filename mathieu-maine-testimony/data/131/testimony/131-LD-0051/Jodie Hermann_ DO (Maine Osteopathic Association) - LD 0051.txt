Senator  Rafferty,  Representative  Brennan  and distingu ished members of the Committee on  Education 
and Cultural Affairs , 
 
My name is Jodie Hermann, D O, FACOI, FACP, MBA. I am board certified in Internal Medicine an d 
Neurom uscular Manual Medicine  and I practice inter nal medicine and Osteopathic Manipulative 
Medicine at area  hospitals , such as Maine M edical Center .  I am please d to provide  testimon y on behalf 
of the Maine Osteopathic Association  in opposition to LD51, LD 1098 and LD1209 , whic h all propose  
to reinstate  religious and  philosophical exemptions  removed from Public Law 2019, chapter 154 .  
 
The Maine Osteo pathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization representing approximately 
400 osteopathic physicians as well as more than 700 residents and stu dents. Our missio n is to “ serve the 
Osteopathic profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated e ffort of professional education, 
advocacy and member services in order to ensure the availability of quality osteopathic health care to the 
people of th is State.”  
 
The MO A is a strong supporter of  childhood  immunizations  and was  a propone nt of the 2019 law  as 
well a s a member of the No on 1 Campaign Coalition  opposing the statewide refer endum  attempting to 
appeal the law .  There are dozens of  diseases that can be prevented  with routine ch ildhood vaccination, 
including Measles , Pertussis, Mumps , Hepatitis, Polio, Varicella, etc. The side effects and risks of 
contracting  these diseases range from mild discomfort to such as fever, chills, and vomiting to drast ic 
outcomes like heart failure, paralysis or even death.  Most childhood vaccines are 90% to 99% effective 
in preventing disease .1 The safety of v accines is thoroughly stu died before they are licensed for public 
use and there is a strong system in place to monitor the safet y of vaccines. As is the case with any 
medicine , vaccines can cause side effe cts. However, seriou s adverse events from vaccines are very rare.2

 2 Maine ’s vaccine law  has had its fair share of debat e. The Legislature passed t he law striking religious 
and phi losophical exemption s in 20 19, after very careful consideration . Then in 2020, a  people’s veto  
attempted to overturn this decision . Maine people voted and a wide majority (more than 72%) chose to 
protect public health by eliminating non-medical exemptions in our school -ready vaccine laws .  
 
In 2017 -2018 , Maine had the 7th highest non -medical vaccine exemption rate  in the count ry, a rate 
which  continued to increase to a peak o f over  5.0%  in the 2019 -2020 sch ool year3. Researchers have 
repea tedly shown that w hen it ’s easier for par ents to avoid vaccines, vaccine exemptions rise. When 
exemption rate s climb, her d immunity i s weak ened and  the risk of outb reak rises. In many areas of the 
state, Mai ne’s community immuni ty was well below safe thresholds and disease outbreaks were  a 
distinct threat.  
  
Since the passage  of Public Law 154, Maine ’s rates for school -ready vaccinations  have  greatly  
improved . Maine CDC ’s latest School Immunization Assessment Report ( 2021-2022)4 reported that 
more than 95 percent of kindergarteners were vaccinated for diseases such as whooping cough, polio 
and measles during th e 2021 -2022 school year, an improvement of two percentage points compared to 
the year before.  Total exemption s also fell to 1.8 percent, which is half the rate from the previous y ear.  
 
These  results are  very encouraging. Because of Public Law 154 Maine ’s children are better protected 
from preventable diseases. And pa rents, along with their children ’s healthcare professionals , are still 
able to opt ou t of vaccinations when  and if medically  appropriate .  
 
It is for these reasons  the MOA urges the committee t o vote ought not to pass on LD 51 , LD 1098 and 
LD 1209 .
