LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education & Cultural 
Affairs Committee, my name is Nicholas Fikus, I am 10 years old and I am testifying 
in SUPPORT of LD 51.
I support this bill because I want to go back to school.  I see my big brother and sister 
go to school everyday and they always talk about their friends and the fun they have 
at school all day.  I have only a couple friends and I mostly learn alone.  I don’t really 
like learning alone, it makes me feel different and I feel like a weird kid.  
Since I have to be homeschooled, my mom can’t work because she has to teach me.  
My dad had to get a bigger job that has many hours and he has to go on long business 
trips for the military.  I feel really sad when he is away and I miss him.  
Please let me go back to school so I can have friends and my dad back.
Thank you for listening.
Nick J. Fikus
