LD 51
Our state has decided that they know what is best for all of its citizens, without 
consideration for people who have differing beliefs from theirs. There is no one size 
fits all when it comes to medical procedures. We have removed the fundamental 
principal of "Our body, our choice" and "Defend a Woman's right to Choose" with the
installation of LD798. IF you support either of those ideas, you must support the 
removal of the mandate on vaccines. If you do not see that supporting one but not the 
other is hypocritical, then you do not deserve to represent the people in your town, or 
the people in the State of Maine. 
Our people should have religious freedom, they should be able to make their own 
choices based on their personal philosophy and beliefs. They should be required to 
protect their own children, and others, but allowed the ability to determine how to do 
this personally. The state has no business deciding what medical procedures are 
required and restricting the access to public institutions for non-compliance. 
Re-instating the religious exemption is a step in the direction toward freedom. 
Freedom deserves your support.
