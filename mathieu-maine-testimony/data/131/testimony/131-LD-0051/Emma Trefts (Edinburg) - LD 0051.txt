Emma Trefts
Edinburg
LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD51. 
Hello, my name is Emma Trefts. I am currently in 11th grade and I am 17 years old. 
What it would mean to me to be able to go back to school for my senior year is having
an actual last high school year experience. This would mean I would be able to do 
sports that I have missed so much. I could be a part of a pep rally or student section. I 
could go to senior prom and march in my cap and gown with my graduating class. 
Since being taken out of school, I have really struggled mentally. You never 
understand how badly you can miss something until it literally gets stolen from you. 
My anxiety is something I really struggle with now. I have also experienced 
depression, and have become an introvert. 
Passing this law would not only mean a lot to me, but it would mean a lot to my two 
younger sisters. I don't want them to have to miss out on high school like I did. It's not
fair. Going back to school would also mean me trying to get back my friendships that 
this law made me lose. 
So, please, I as that you vote ought to pass on LD51.
