Good
morning,
Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Committee
of
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs,
My
name
is
Kathleen
Hewey .
I
live
in
Hiram.
I
am
providing
written
testimony
in
support
of
LD
51,
LD
869,
LD
1098,
LD
1 148,
LD
1209,
and
LD
1228
on
behalf
of
our
family
because
we
are
unable
to
do
so
in
person.
Since
the
passage
of
LD
798,
I
have
been
the
primary
caregiver
and
educator
for
my
10
year
old
daughter .
My
daughter
lost
access
to
school
and
her
peer
group,
and
I
lost
the
opportunity
to
work
outside
the
home
and
bring
in
much
needed
income.
It
is
quite
challenging
to
live
on
one
income
and
we
have
found
it
dif ficult
to
stay
afloat
-
nevermind
get
ahead
-
financially .
My
husband
works
extra
jobs,
which
means
we
donâ€™t
get
to
see
him
as
much.
My
daughter
is
an
only
child,
and
has
felt
very
lonely
despite
all
my
ef forts
to
keep
her
connected
with
peers.
The
state
would
say
that
we
do
have
a
choice:
we
can
vaccinate
fully
and
my
daughter
can
attend
public
school,
or
we
can
opt
out
of
one
vaccine
and
homeschool.
My
daughter
really
wants
to
go
to
public
school;
she
loved
having
a
class
and
a
teacher .
But
she
also
understands
that
she
would
have
to
get
a
vaccine
that
could
cause
her
to
go
into
anaphylactic
shock
in
order
to
do
so.
Hmmm.
Is
this
really
the
choice
we
are
left
with?
And
she
cannot
get
a
medical
exemption
because
under
LD
798,
she
must
have
an
anaphylactic
reaction
T O
the
vaccine
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
exemption.
Public
education
should
be
available
to
all,
with
no
strings
attached,
and
everyone
should
have
the
freedom
to
choose
what
is
best
for
their
family
in
regard
to
medical
decisions.
These
are
basic
rights.
Please
consider
supporting
these
bills
and
vote
Ought
to
Pass.
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
read
my
testimony .
Sincerely ,
Kathleen
Hewey
