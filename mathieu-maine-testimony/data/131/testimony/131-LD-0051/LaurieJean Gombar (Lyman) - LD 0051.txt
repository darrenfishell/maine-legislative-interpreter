LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD 51. I am sharing 
testimony in support of LD 51, as well as LD 869, LD 1098, LD 1148, LD 1209, and 
LD 1228.  Public education should be available to all, no matter the decisions made in
the doctor's office.  Also in short, the system is broken and has lost my trust.  
Implementation of LD798 chased away good students, good citizens and great 
medical professionals.  Respectfully, LaurieJean Gombar  Lyman
