Dear

and

L D
5 1
An
Act
to
Restore
Religious
and
Philosophical
Exemptions
to
Immunization
Requirements.
I
support
LD
51
for
the
financial
support
and
stability
this
bill
of fers
our
schools.
Following
the
passing
of
LD
798
and
COVID,
Maine
suf fered
from
a
wave
of
students
leaving
public
schools,
resulting
in
financial
hardship
for
districts.
Maine’ s
schools
cannot
af ford
to
lose
any
more
students
at
this
time.
W e
cannot
af ford
to
lose
students
who
are
healthy
and
high
performing
simply
because
they
are
missing
a
vaccine.
LD
51
provides
stability
and
consistency
for
our
students.
The
pandemic
has
been
a
severe
disruption
to
children’ s
education.
Must
we
further
disrupt
learning?
Is
it
fair
for
students
who
have
attended
school
for
a
decade
or
more
under
previous
exemption
laws
to
now
be
denied
a
high
school
diploma
or
a
college
degree?
LD
51
provides
educational
continuity
for
all.
School
vaccination
rates
are
the
highest
they
have
ever
been,
steadily
above
95%.
For
the
years
leading
up
to
the
passing
of
LD
798,
Maine
school
vaccination
rates
were
higher
than
the
national
average.
LD
51
acknowledges
Maine’ s
success
at
vaccination
rates,
and
allows
free
and
appropriate
education
for
ALL
students.
There
is
no
single
documented
case
of
an
immunocompromised
child
contracting
a
vaccine-targeted
disease
in
the
state
of
Maine.
With
such
low
risk
in
our
state,
why
would
we
reject
healthy ,
bright
students
from
our
school
system?
When
Maine
became
a
state
200
years
ago,
we
adopted
the
motto
Dirigo
-
“I
direct,
I
guide.”
Our
education
system
encourages
students
to
be
forward
thinking,
to
be
leaders.
Leadership
requires
diversity .
LD
51
allows
for
diversity
of
religious
and
philosophical
beliefs
in
our
school
system.
By
voting
“Ought
to
pass,”
you
uphold
our
state’ s
promise
to
provide
an
education
for
ALL
students,
free
of
discrimination.
LD
51
honors
fairness;
it
honor
the
decision
parents
made
when
they
first
enrolled
their
child
in
school
under
Maine
law
that
allowed
exemptions.
I
urge
you
to
vote
“Ought
to
Pass.”
Respectfully ,

LD 51
I am writing in support of LD 51 An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical 
Exemptions to Immunization Requirements. 
I support LD 51 for the financial support and stability this bill offers our schools.  
Following the passing of LD 798 and COVID, Maine suffered from a wave of 
students leaving public schools, resulting in financial hardship for districts.  Maine’s 
schools cannot afford to lose any more students at this time.  We cannot afford to lose
students who are healthy and high performing simply because they are missing a 
vaccine.
 
LD 51 provides stability and consistency for our students.  The pandemic has been a 
severe disruption to children’s education.  Must we further disrupt learning?  Is it fair 
for students who have attended school for a decade or more under previous exemption
laws to now be denied a high school diploma or a college degree?  LD 51 provides 
educational continuity for all.
School vaccination rates are the highest they have ever been, steadily above 95%. For 
the years leading up to the passing of LD 798, Maine school vaccination rates were 
higher than the national average.  LD 51 acknowledges Maine’s success at 
vaccination rates, and allows free and appropriate education for ALL students.  There 
is no single documented case of an immunocompromised child contracting a 
vaccine-targeted disease in the state of Maine. With such low risk in our state, why 
would we reject healthy, bright students from our school system?
When Maine became a state 200 years ago, we adopted the motto Dirigo - “I direct, I 
guide.”  Our education system encourages students to be forward thinking, to be 
leaders.  Leadership requires diversity.  LD 51 allows for diversity of religious and 
philosophical beliefs in our school system.  By voting “Ought to pass,” you uphold 
our state’s promise to provide an education for ALL students, free of discrimination.  
LD 51 honors fairness; it honor the decision parents made when they first enrolled 
their child in school under Maine law that allowed exemptions.
I urge you to vote “Ought to Pass.”
