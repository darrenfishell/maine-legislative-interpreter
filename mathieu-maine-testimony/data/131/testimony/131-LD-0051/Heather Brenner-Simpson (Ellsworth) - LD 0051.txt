LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, I am asking you today to vote ‘ought to 
pass’ on LD 51.
Hi, my name is Heather and I’m fifteen years old. I am only in ninth grade, but I’m 
astonished that I even need to type something like this up. A teenager my age should 
be writing their five paragraph essay for English class, not the reasons that they 
should be able to be allowed to learn in a public school. I have two friends who go to 
Ellsworth public high school, one who is vaccinated, and the other who has a medical 
exemption. A few months ago, my vaccinated friend asked me if I wanted to join her 
at a school dance. At the high school that I’m not able to attend. I am also still able to 
go to shows and sports games there, living and breathing around all the kids who are 
fully vaccinated. The most absurd thing is that I can’t participate in the theater 
program at the public high school, but I could play in the pit orchestra for that same 
play, think about that.
 I am fully involved in my local community theater, acting right next to many kids 
who are fully vaccinated and go to public school. I also attend art classes and recitals, 
babysit public school children, and am looking forward to working my first local part 
time job this summer. So why can’t I learn in my own town’s public school? Why 
have I been told that the vaccine is completely safe, but know numerous people with 
vaccine injuries? Why can’t I have a choice to put a foreign, man made substance into
my body, in order to get a public education? I urge you to vote “Ought to pass”,  to 
give me my choice and my freedom back.
Thank you,
Heather Brenner-Simpson
