LD 51
Good morning,
I am writing in support of L.D. 51. My name is Janice Hallam, my residence is in 
Garland, 
and I am retired. I have 6 children, 17 grandchildren, 4 great grandchildren. 
I do not believe Maine should discriminate against children only because 
of their vaccination status. All Mainers should have the right to an education 
or childcare. Our children should not be segregated and denied their basic 
rights only because the won't follow the Maine CDC guidelines exactly.  
Exemptions should be allowed. Many children have suffered injury from
vaccinations. And many have not. There should be a right to choose.  
The parents should have both the right and responsibility to choose
what is right for their child. 
Respectfully submitted,
Janice Hallam
