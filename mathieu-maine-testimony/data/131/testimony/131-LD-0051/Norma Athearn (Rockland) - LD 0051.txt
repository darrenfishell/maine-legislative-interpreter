LD 51
Honorable Legislators:  I encourage you to vote in favor of LD 51.   I have been a 
supporter of vaccinations in general but have become concerned about restrictions on 
fundamental rights in the questionable name of public health.  I urge you to restore 
the provisions for religious or philosophical exemptions to immunization 
requirements.  I hold dearly a  sincere belief in the sanctity of informed consent for 
any medical procedure, including vaccinations.  It is becoming clear that we have not 
been given the facts necessary to give such informed consent, including the risks of 
adverse advents.  Our public health agencies are not infallible and mandates are 
wrong, especially as it concerns experimental products injected into our sacred 
bodies!  Thank you for your vote to restore these needed exemptions.  Sincerely, 
Norma Athearn, Rockland, Maine
