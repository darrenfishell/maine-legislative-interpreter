,,OUGHTTO PASS"
*DISCRIMINATION = " The unjust or prejudicialtreatment of different catagories of people.."
*Types of DISCRIMINATION (via CDC.gov) include Religion, Reprisal/Retaliation, AEe, etc.
*DISCRTMINATION IS ILLEGAT AND IMMORAL.
*MEDICAL PRIVACY/CONFIDENTIALITY = "...the prinicpal of keeping secure & secret from
others....it is the right of ev.ery patient eyen after death."
*Places of employment, schools, etc, should have NO access to medical records.
* Medical records include vaccination records.
When LD 798 was brought forth, then accepted, it negatively impacted my trust & faith in the
authenticity of our laws, our government and our medical, educational, & judicial systems.
LD 798 has been a disrespect of law and of people.
LD 798 has detrimentally impacted many families. Due to Privacy/Confidentiality it is not my
place to share their personal stories. I hope they choose to.
LD 51 is an opportunity to begin to restore trust and faith.
Leadership requires Personal Responsibility, Truth, Transparency, Respect, & Accountability.
