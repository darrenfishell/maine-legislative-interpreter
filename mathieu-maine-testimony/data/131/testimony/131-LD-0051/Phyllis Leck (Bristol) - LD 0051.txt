LD 51
Hello thank you for this hearing 
Hi my name is Phyllis Leck from Bristol, I am in favor of LD 51
Parents have a right to have their children exempt from vaccines if it does not line up 
with their beliefs
Not everyone is suited for vaccination
I would like it known that I support the vote to reinstate our law that we previously 
had.
Thank you
