LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of
the committee, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD 51.
I am writing in support of this legislation to return the right of Maine citizens to have 
medical autonomy combined with equal access to education and employment. One 
could argue that we still have the right to choose.  And you would be right-we don’t 
have to choose a public/college education for our kids or have to choose a job that 
provides a good income-we could remain uneducated, poor, and stressed beings.  
When we lose the ability to have equal opportunities for our citizens it comes at a 
great cost;  in dollars, in mental health decline, in education loss, and an overall 
decline in our society as a whole.
I worked in the healthcare system in 2020.  I cannot go back.  So I had to choose to 
not have a job that provided a good income for my family.  If this bill you are 
considering passes I would have the option to once again work in that field. I am not a
risk to anyone. I was never a threat to anyone. But because I don’t have a medical 
issue, I cannot go back to my job.
My two college-age kids have medical exemptions.  It has been incredibly stressful 
navigating this climate and the discrimination they have faced.  Their future is 
unpredictable and has put undue stress on our family. I implore you to pass this bill 
and allow young people to make independent decisions about their life and body and 
not have to be defined by their illnesses. 
Every person should have medical choices. When there is risk there needs to be a 
choice.  By passing this bill you provide an equal ground to ALL citizens. Please 
consider each person and the lives they live and the intricacies that exist. No one 
should have to defend why they don’t want to take a particular medicine.  This is the 
United States of America.  We are a free society.
 Respectfully please vote “ought to pass” on LD51.
