To whom it may concern, 
I am a graduating homeschool senior. I am writing today in support of restoring 
religious and philosophical exemptions.  For the past three years I have faced severe 
discrimination and have not been allowed to access educational opportunities in my 
area. This has negatively impacted my education as well as my mental health.  
Restoring these exemptions would restore equal access to educational opportunities 
for ALL students.
