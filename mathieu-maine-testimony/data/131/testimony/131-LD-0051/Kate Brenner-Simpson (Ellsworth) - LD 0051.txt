LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, I am asking you today to vote ‘ought to 
pass’ on LD 51.
During my time as a Maine resident I spent two and a half years in the public school 
system attending a local state university and although my time was short compared to 
others who grew up in the public schools, both LD 798 and LD 51 still effect me 
greatly. I have lost my access to the public education I was counting so heavily on to 
finish my degree, I, along with my younger brother, have had to make the difficult 
decision to leave our family behind in Maine and move out to other states that will 
still grant us our philosophical and religious exemptions, my younger sister has lost 
her access to public school and participation in all extracurricular activities she enjoys
so much, and my mother has been unable to continue her journey of entering the 
workforce she has been tirelessly preparing for for years. 
The life we all knew together has now been split up unexpectedly, we are no longer 
able to appreciate the educational, financial, and medical experiences we’ve always 
known and relied on, and most importantly a giant rift has opened up between 
families like ours asking for philosophical and religious exemptions and those who 
don’t need to. The deep pain and anguish I felt having to leave my family has taken a 
large toll on my mental and physical health which in turn has effected my work 
performance and every day life in a new state. I love Maine and want to return 
someday but my decision to leave was due to the fact that I could not live the same 
life freely anymore and under current circumstances I would not be able to raise my 
own kids there in the future either.
The passing of LD 51 will allow a myriad of families like my own to stay together, 
stay in Maine, and continue contributing to the economy and livelihood of the state 
we all care so much about. Without LD 51 many parents will be forced to quit their 
jobs or work from home to homeschool their kids who can’t attend public schools, 
many employers will be short staffed, many students in higher education will not 
attend Maine schools and apply elsewhere taking their much needed skills and talents 
with them, and a large proportion of Mainers will be forced to leave much like myself
in search of a more equal state to live.
I am asking you today to vote ‘ought to pass’ on LD 51, it is very important for the 
success of the state of Maine and all its residents that the public education system 
stays open and equal for all individuals deserving of it for generations yet to come, 
thank you for your consideration,
Kate Brenner-Simpson
