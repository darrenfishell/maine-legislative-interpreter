 Testimony of the Maine Association of School Nurses in Opposition of 
 LD 51, “An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical Exemptions to 
 Immunization Requirements”.

 President, Maine Association of School Nurses

 Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan and distinguished members of 
 the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee:  My name is Angie Buker and I 
 am president of the Maine Association of School Nurses (MASN) and a 
 member of the National Association of School Nurses (NASN). MASN 
 represents more than half of Maine’s Pre K-12 school nurses.  Our mission is 
 to optimize student health and learning by advancing the practice of school 
 nursing. 
 MASN has reviewed the above proposed legislation and has concluded that 
 we cannot support LD 51 “An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical 
 Exemptions to Immunization Requirements”. 
 It is the position of NASN that immunizations are essential to primary 
 prevention of disease from infancy through adulthood.  Promotion of 
 immunizations by the registered professional school nurse is central to the 
 public health focus of school nursing practice.  According to the Centers for 
 Disease Control (CDC) (2011), the impact of vaccines in reducing and 
 eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases has been one of the 10 great public 
 health achievements in the United States. 
 This law has already been debated and decided in 2019 with more than 72% 
 of the voters choosing to protect public health by eliminating loopholes in 
 Maine school vaccine laws.  Since this decision was made vaccine 
 exemptions have decreased from 6.2% to 1.8% in 2021 according to the 
 annual Annie E. Casey Foundation Kids Count survey. This means that more 
 children are protected against preventable diseases. That leaves a small 
 portion of children that have medical conditions prohibiting specific 
 immunizations.  When granted appropriately, medical exemptions do not 
 compromise community immunity. It is this specific group of children that 
 depend on community immunity for protection in order to safely attend 
 school. 
 We ask you to please consider these reasons,  maintain Maine’s strong 
 vaccination law and not move the problem to different  sectors. MASN urges 
 the committee to vote  Ought Not to Pass on LD 51.  Thank you for listening 
 to the concerns of MASN as we strive to keep our students healthy and in the 
 classroom as well as support parents making the best healthcare decisions 
 for their children.
