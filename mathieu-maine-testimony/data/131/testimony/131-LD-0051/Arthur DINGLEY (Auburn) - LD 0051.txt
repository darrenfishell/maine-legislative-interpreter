Arthur DINGLEY
Auburn
LD 51
To: Chairs of the Standing Joint Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, 
Honorable Sen. Joseph Rafferty and Honorable Rep. Michael Brennan, and members 
of this Committee.
My name is Arthur Dingley. I am a former attorney, a retired physician, and a lifelong
resident of Maine.  I live in Auburn. This testimony is submitted IN OPPOSITION to 
LD 51 and its "philosophical and religious" companions, LD 869, 1098, 1148, 1209, 
and 1228.
There should be a bucket on the Clerk's desk labeled: "Bills with no chance submitted
by Legislators pandering to their unhinged base."  These bills should be in it.
There is NO recognized or recognizable religion which forbids its adherents 
from accepting any vaccine for adults or children. Those claiming otherwise are 
merely making that claim and attempting to use Freedom of Religion as a 
Constitutional-sounding counterweight to something they find personally offensive 
based on conspiracy theories. The closest thing to reality in this objection is the idea 
that the COVID-19 vaccine contains aborted fetal tissue.  It does not. 
That leaves "philosophical" objections. Those of us old enough to remember polio 
and personally know its victims, old enough to wear our smallpox vaccination scars 
with pride, those who have gladly taken our Hepatitis, influenza, and COVID 
vaccinations to keep our patients safe, have no wish to accommodate the objections of
Maine's miniscule population of "philosophical" objectors, those profoundly selfish 
and narcissistic few who think that their "rights" should be allowed to Trump science, 
common sense, and the safety of Maine's children.
When this came before the voters in referendum, it went down in flames by a margin 
larger than any I remember. Maine voters buried it. Please, put pennies on its eyes.
Thank you for considering these remarks.
