LD 51
To the Honorable Members of the Joint Committee on Education and Cultural 
Affairs:
I have been a Clinical Psychologist in Maine for nearly 25 years, recently retired, and 
am committed to the well-being of Maine people.
I strongly urge you to oppose LD 51, LD 1098 and LD 1209. These bills seek to 
reinstate loopholes to avoid childhood vaccinations, thus putting Maine children at 
risk for deadly childhood diseases. This issue has already been decided by Maine 
people, with 72% in support of eliminating these loopholes in a referendum vote.  We 
have a duty to keep Maine children safe.
I also strongly urge you to oppose LD 1228, LD 1148, and LD 869.  It is important to 
assure that all students, younger and older, have protection from Covid-19.
Thank you for your consideration,
Lenore M. Tipping, Ph.D.
