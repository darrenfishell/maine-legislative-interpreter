Destiny Johnson
Windham 
LD 51
Good morning, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and esteemed members of 
the Committee of Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Destiny Johnson. I was born in Portland and raised in Naples. My 
significant other Jon and I own and operate a Masonry Company located in Windham 
and we homeschool our daughter Layle. I am here to testify in support of LD 51, LD 
869, LD 1098, LD 1148, LD 1209, and LD 1228.
In 2019 and early 2020 our daughter Layle attended RSU14 located in Windham. We 
used our religious and philosophical exemption for the MMRV to allow for her to 
remain in school.  
It was August of 2020 before the school opened, Jon and I went in to give the nurse 
and principal Layle’s POSITIVE titers for MMRV. The principal told us that they 
would not accept her titers and that Layle would have to be vaccinated for MMRV if 
she came back to school in September.
We knew going in that philosophical and religious exemptions from required vaccines
would no longer be allowed because of LD 798 that was signed into law in May of 
2019 and would go into effect on Sept. 1, 2021. 
This was August of 2020 almost a year before LD798 would go into effect.
Our daughter was denied public access to Maine schools a year before LD798 went 
into effect. 
It’s now 2023, our daughter is still immune and has POSITIVE titers for MMRV. 
Which is seen as the equivalent of getting the vaccine, but she's still not allowed to 
attend school.
Thank you for your time,
Destiny Johnson
