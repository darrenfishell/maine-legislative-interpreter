I am in support of the bill. One of the most wonderful things about our country has 
always been the volume of freedoms we enjoy in all facets of life, including the 
freedom to choose through informed consent. Informed consent says that two people 
with the same information can make two completely different choices and neither of 
them is right or wrong.  That is what medical freedom is and should always be. There 
are benefits and risks to every medical procedure, every immunization - whether or 
not the procedure has good intentions. Doing the “right thing” means you’ve weighed 
the risks and benefits for yourself, and are making an informed decision! What’s right
for one person, may be wrong for the other - both, on an intuitive and biological level.
Some are not wrong simply they believe differently than another. Each person likely 
has just as strong of a reason for their choice as the other - and our constitution was 
built on the foundations that protect those freedoms to choose. Please restore our 
rights to religious and philosophical exemptions to immunizations for both students 
and the workplace.
