LD 51
To Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and the Members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs,
I am testifying in support of of ME LD 51 and LD 1098
I am in favor of restoring religious and philosophical exemptions to immunization 
requirements for work and for education.  Being a healthcare professional, I can see 
that the mandates have caused much harm to the healthcare profession.  Doctors, 
nurses and CNAs have left the healthcare setting in droves.  It has even been difficult 
for hospitals and nursing homes to staff the kitchens and janitorial departments.  I 
know many Mainers who have suffered terribly while waiting for medical procedures 
due to the staffing shortages. Maine hospitals, doctor's offices and nursing homes 
have suffered financially for lack of staffing.  
The mandates have caused suffering for Mainers across the board of healthcare and 
education.  Religious freedom and philosophical exemptions must be restored to 
Maine citizens.
Sincerely,
Dean Chancey, DC
Farmington, Maine
