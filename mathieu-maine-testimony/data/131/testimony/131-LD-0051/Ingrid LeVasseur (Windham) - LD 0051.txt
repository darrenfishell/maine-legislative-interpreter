LD 51
Dear Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
I'm writing to voice my support for LD51, An Act to Restore Religious and 
Philosophical Exemptions to Immunization Requirements. 
I strongly urge the passage of this bill because the CDC has put the COVID-19 jabs 
on the childhood schedule. These jabs were brought forth through Emergency Use 
Authorization and therefore not fully tested for years the way regular vaccines have 
historically been tested. The ineffectiveness of the product and the dangerous, 
sometimes lethal, side effects of the COVID jab have moved other countries to 
discontinue the use of this product. The UK, for example, has discontinued promotion
of this product for anyone under the age of 50. 
The incidence of homeschooling jumped dramatically in Maine when the 
philosophical and religious exemptions were removed a few years ago. Given the 
particularly low uptake of the COVID jab in children nation-wide, it is safe to assume
that more parents will remove their children from school when the COVID jab 
becomes mandated by the State. If you want young families to stay in Maine (please 
remember that we are the oldest state in the Union and cannot afford to lose young 
people) I strongly suggest you make it easy for parents to work and educate their 
children within the State. Don't force parents to give any medical intervention to their 
children that they don't feel is right for their child. A parent will never jeopardize their
child's safety for the sake of a mandate. They will either pull their child from school 
or pack up and leave the state, never to return. 
This is your opportunity to demonstrate that Maine wants and supports young 
families. Support LD 51. Thank you.
