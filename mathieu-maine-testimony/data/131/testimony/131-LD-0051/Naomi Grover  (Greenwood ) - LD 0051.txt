I would like you to vote on restoring Maine families right to.medical freedom. 
Choosing between strongly held beliefs and being able to use education on the state is
wrong. It is hard as a parent to see opportunities that our children should be able to 
take advantage of but can't because of strongly held beliefs. To know that instead of 
staying her the children may leave because of the lack of openness that this state use 
to have.  Please give us back the right to have both educational opportunities and the 
ability to practice our beliefs in peace, in the state that we have so far chosen to live.
