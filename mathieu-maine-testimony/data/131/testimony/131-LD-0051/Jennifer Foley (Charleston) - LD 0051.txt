LD 51
Dear members of Maine's Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, 
Please support LDs 51, 869, 1098, 1148, 1209 and 1228 this session. These bills 
would restore religious and philosophical
 exemptions to vaccines and prevent COVID-19 vaccination requirements in Maine's 
public and private school systems, protecting education access for all children in 
Maine. Maine and national public health officials misled the public during the 
COVID-19 pandemic about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Today, the data is 
clear that COVID-19 poses little risk to school-aged children, and this population has 
little to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, the authorized COVID-19 
vaccines do not stop people from contracting the disease or transmitting it to others. 
Despite these facts, public health officials used fear and panic to cajole education 
institutions to mandate these products on staff and students. This should never be 
allowed to happen again.
 Implementing a mandate today is akin to kicking tens of thousands of students out of 
Maine's education system. Please learn from the mistakes of the pandemic and 
support LDs 51, 869, 1098, 1148, 1209, and 1228 this session. Thank you.
Sincerely, 
Jennifer Grey Foley
