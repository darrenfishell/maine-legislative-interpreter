LD 51
My name is Jim Church, I'm a retired Physician Assistant, and I strongly support 
LD51.
Prior to LD798, we lived in peace with the Philosophic and Religious exemptions.  
Parents had the right to choose to exempt their children from immunization 
requirements.  They weren't being lazy and they weren't being uncaring: many of 
these parents had already experienced profound vaccine injury in their own families.  
They had also spent 10's or 100's of hours researching vaccine science and safety 
issues.  Many of them know considerably more than the average medical provider.  
This is quite understandable if you have a medical background.  Other than being 
presented the US CDC's immunization recommendations, I received exactly 0 hours 
of education on the topic of vaccines in medical school. 
I do not trust US federal public health institutes with regard to vaccines. One point: 
the US government has NEVER funded a long-term study comparing health outcomes
of children who follow the CDC immunization guidelines with children who are not 
vaccinated.  Never.  If one's sincere goal is knowledge and safety, this would be the 
starting point and would be ongoing.  Why haven't these studies been done?  Rather 
than LD51, I wish today we were discussing legislation that would make Maine the 
first state in the country to conduct a comparison study of the vaccinated vs. 
unvaccinated. 
Let's not grind down those few percent of Mainers who would reasonably and 
thoughtfully elect for exemptions.  They are our brethren.  They are sincere and good 
and they pose no harm.  Let us temper our desire to control.  May we respect and 
allow for each other.
Let's pass LD51.  We can live in peace again with the Philosophic and Religious 
exemptions.
Thank you.
