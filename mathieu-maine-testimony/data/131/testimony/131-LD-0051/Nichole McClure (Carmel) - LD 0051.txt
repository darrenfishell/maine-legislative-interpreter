To the State of Maine Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
Individual healthcare is no "one size fits all". Beyond our varying physical needs, 
therein dwell a mind and spirit that should be carefully considered and cared for just 
alike.
The same might be said for one’s education; which is why I choose to enroll my child 
in a local, private school that promotes a Classical Christian education. As a follower 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, I’m greatly compelled to ensure my daughter is taught 
through biblical perspective while taking into consideration her gifts and interests. I 
am grateful to be a citizen of this country that was built with respect for our 
God-given free will.
However, despite our nation’s foundation, recent Maine leadership has sought to take 
these individual rights from us. Ensuring we comply to inject matter that may not be 
well with our physical bodies, nor minds and spirits, to get the very education we pay 
for, in addition to taxes that fund public government schools. If freedoms and options 
were not important to Maine citizens, I suspect we would not put such hard-earned 
money towards these vital matters.
To promote the general welfare and the ability to secure the blessings of liberty, as 
held prominently in our country’s Constitution, I highly encourage you to restore the 
ability for the Maine citizens, at a minimum those who have purchased private or 
other alternative education, to make decisions based on our own religious and/or 
philosophical beliefs. 
Those bound by oath or affirmation to uphold this Constitution should see it as just 
that.
Thank you,
Nichole McClure
