LD 51
My name is John Anderson. I request you vote to support LD51 and all other bills 
pertaining to restoring religious and philosophical exemptions.
My wife and I are proud Mainers, born and raised. After serving on Active Duty 
military and living elsewhere for 9 years, we chose to move our family back to Maine.
We appreciate the fresh air and water, low crime rates, and small town feel of 
knowing someone who knows someone almost anywhere you go in this beautiful 
state. 
Please support LD51. My family has had to consider leaving our home state, where 
we own a home, pay taxes, and truly enjoy our way of life here. Restoring religious 
and philosophical exemptions allows for Mainers to stay in Maine.
