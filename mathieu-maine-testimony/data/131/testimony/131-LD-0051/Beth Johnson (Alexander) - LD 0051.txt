I believe the last 2 years of vaccine mandates have proven detrimental to our 
healthcare industry. Stripping hard working Maine people of their constitutional right 
to a religious exemption has caused an unprecedented reduction in staffing in 
healthcare and EMS. Help us get back to work by restoring our rights to these 
exemptions!
