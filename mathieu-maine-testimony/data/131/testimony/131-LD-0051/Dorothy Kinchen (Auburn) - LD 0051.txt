LD 51
Distinguished members of the Education and Cultural Committee, 
I am asking you to vote ought to pass on LD 51.  I'm simply going to speak to my 
own experiences.  I worked as an RN with hospitalized COVID patients all through 
2020 to April of 2022 (briefly worked under a medical exemption).  I have more first 
hand experience with sick and dying COVID patients than most.  I also have seen the 
lack of staff at the hospital I worked at and how that affected patient care and staff 
moral.  
With all of that knowledge and experience, I still choose not to receive a COVID 
vaccine and was terminated from my position of over 10 years at that hospital (17 
years total as an RN).  My reasons are my own, but had it been an option, I would 
have submitted a religious/philosophical exemption and continued to care for our own
state's hospitalized patients.  I also personally know many other healthcare 
professionals that would have done the same.  
By taking away religious/philosophical exemptions, you have taken away people's 
choices to work or go to school while also remaining true to their beliefs.  Please vote 
ought to past on LD 51 and restore those choices for the people that need them.
Thank you.
Dorothy Kinchen
