LD 51
Dear Respective Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
I am writing to submit public testimony in support of LD 51: An Act to Restore 
Religious and Philosophical Exemptions to Immunization Requirements. Forcing 
employees or students to have to choose between their job or education and their 
religion is coercion, and is the antithesis of the Free Exercise Clause under the First 
Amendment.
In fact, the state violated any public interest argument by allowing COVID-positive 
employees to treat patients - the very people the mandate was "supposed to protect". 
According to an article from WMTW, in January of 2022 St. Mary's Hospital in 
Lewiston permitted COVID-positive employees to return to work because of the 
severe workforce shortage exacerbated by the law.
It is without a doubt the COVID vaccines are not without risk When risk is present, 
the decision should be left to the individual, or in the case of minors left up to the 
parents. Weighing the risks/benefits of medical intervention with one's religious or 
philosophical views is the epitome of informed consent. Not only is informed consent 
ethical, it is a legal obligation. 
It is for these reasons I am urging a vote of Ought to Pass.
Thank you,
John Lewis
