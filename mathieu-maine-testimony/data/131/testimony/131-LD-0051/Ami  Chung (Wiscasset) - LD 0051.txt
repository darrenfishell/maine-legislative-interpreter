LD 51
The changes in our legislation LD 51 has immensely impacted our my families lives.  
My two kids 8 and 15 are now my full responsibility to educate which has impacted 
not only our financial situation but my children no longer have an equal opportunity 
to form peer groups, or an opportunity of creating meaningful relationships with peers
and teachers…and then college! 
And regardless of our Philosophical decision, my youngest has an autoimmune 
disease (‘CVS’ cyclical vomiting syndrome) where unknown triggers or allergens can
set off a seventy-two  hour vomiting episode that takes three days to recover from. 
We don’t know all the triggers and we are not willing to try to vaccinate and “wait 
and see”.  Some doctors. have thought she qualifies for an exemption but the way the 
medical exemption form is written she would have to have, almost died from taking 
the vaccine, before she’d qualified...  This is not a chance or choice that we want to 
risk.  We should be able to have the freedom to choose what goes into our bodies.  
And every child should have an equal opportunity to education! 
This situation has marginalized my children and family. Our Maine legislators should 
be aware of how this is affecting people like us.
