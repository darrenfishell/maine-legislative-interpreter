LD 51
I would like to show my full and total support of LD 51- An Act to Restore Religious 
and Philosophical Exemptions to Immunization Requirements as it OUGHT TO 
PASS. Our family and many in our community have been greatly affected financially 
and mentally due to the lack of exemption options to gain access to education, as well 
to mention the financial and communal toll on our schools of losing students and solid
families. Not only did this bill affect our full and total access to education, EVEN 
ONLINE, but we are seeing the drastic repercussion of access to healthcare in our 
area due to the loss of doctors and nurses. Our right to choose medical options, such 
as immunizations, based on our belief systems, belongs in our hands as families and 
not the states. Thank you, as I support LD 51 OUGHT TO PASS.
