LD 51
Dear distinguished members and Senators my name is Heather Sprague I live in 
Cushing. I write today in favor of LD51 I believe the covid vaccine was rushed and 
unsafe and is meant to control we the people. I believe fear is being used to keep that 
control. I have heard testimony against restoration of important exemptions to protect 
from children being forced out of school, medical care all because their parents dont 
want them jabbed with dangerous, untested and rushed vaccines that have been 
proven to injure and kill, especially the covid vaccines and people testifying are using 
fear to scare people into agreeing with them. I am a member of the Childrens Health 
Network, lead by Robert F Kennedy Jr a democrat that has alot of FACTS about 
vaccines that prove they are dangerous. I ask that you vote yes to restore religous and 
phyilisophical exemptions and give us back our medical freedom to chose. There is 
no proof that if people dont get immunized a mass pandemic happens. Maybe they 
should stop rushing them into the public and using fear to push them. Thank you for 
your time.
