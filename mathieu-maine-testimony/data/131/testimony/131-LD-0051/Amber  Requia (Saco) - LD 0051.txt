Please restore religious and philosophical exemptions to immunization requirements. 
I believe vaccines as well as any other injections you put into yours or your child's 
body deserves personal choice which supports the reinstatement of philosophical and 
religious belief exemptions.  To allow a State to dictate what will be injected into 
your or your child's body violates ones Civil Rights. This dictate is making many 
want to move to other states and avoid public schooling , Maine was once was an 
attractive place for raising families. The WHO recently said , March 29 2023,  that 
healthy kids and teens are low risk . The New England Journal of Medicine shared 
findings that supported natural immunity being superior to vaccination.  This law is to
reinstate  religious and philosophical exemptions , which never should have been 
removed to begin with. The Covid vaccine was and  is an experiment and violates the 
Nuremberg code " every human being of adult years and sound mine has a right to 
determine what shall be done with their own body. " We are a Christian family with a 
strong moral compass that always supports life .Many of the required vaccines 
support using fetal cells whether during development or production. 
To mandate vaccines that did not stop the spread or stop illness however stopped 
people from being able to work or participate in life is not only unethical but 
unconstitutional. Thank you for your consideration.
