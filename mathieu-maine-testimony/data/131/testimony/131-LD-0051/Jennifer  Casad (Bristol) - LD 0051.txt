LD 51
In Support of LD51
My name is Jennifer Casad. I am a resident of Bristol, Maine. I support LD51. As a 
parent, I make medical decisions in the best interest of my child. I have full 
knowledge of my child’s medical history. I am her Guardian in the true sense of the 
word. Vaccine mandates have greatly limited my daughters opportunity for education 
in the State of Maine. Please vote yes on LD 51, “An Act to Restore Religious and 
Philosophical Exemptions to Immunization Requirements.”
