Community Health Options is Maineâ€™s only nonprofit CO -OP health insurance company. 
We exist for the benefit of our members and our mission which is to provide affordable, 
high quality benefits that promote health and wellbeing.   Because vaccines are essent ial 
to public health, we are opposed to broad exemptions that will undermine what should 
be our first line of defense:   a high vaccination rate that ultimately protects everyone, 
young and old alike.   
There are medical reasons why some people are not able to receive a vaccine. Public 
Law 2019, Chapter 154 maintained the exemption for individuals for whom 
immunization is medically inadvisable. There is a clear consensus in the medical 
community concerning the importance of immunization. We believe Maine stat e law 
should reflect immunization recommendations from our national Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. We encourage this Committee to join us in supporting the 
health and wellbeing of all Mainers by opposing LD 51.  
The COVID -19 pandemic serves as a stark reminder of the danger posed by viruses. 
The intensity and duration of the public health emergency over the past three years is 
nearly unprecedented in living memory in part because of widespread use of vaccines 
for polio, measles, rubella, diphthe ria, and other viruses. Rolling back protections to 
public health is not in the best interest of Mainers.
