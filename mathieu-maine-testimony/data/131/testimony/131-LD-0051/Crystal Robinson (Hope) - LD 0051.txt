LD 51
Dear Honorable Members of This Committee
I am writing in support of LD 51 An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical 
Exemptions to Immunization Requirements.    
I and many others, that I know and love, have been negatively impacted by vaccine 
requirements.  The economic impact has been huge as we have been forced to give up
good jobs, have been denied access to certain public arenas, and are no longer able to 
enroll our children in school.  Children, who are not fully vaccinated, are even banned
from Little League. We are treated like social outcasts. 
We do not need more division in this country.  Laws like this create a them versus us 
mentality.  While I hold no ill feelings toward others for their choices and do not go 
around crusading, I have been subject to hateful comments.  I have been told to my 
face that people like me should be thrown in jail or that we deserve to die.  That is 
scary. 
 
Where is the data to prove that those who choose to delay, spread out, or refuse some 
or all immunizations are a danger to society?   During my lifetime, I have learned to 
not judge medical professionals too harshly because they are humans “practicing” 
medicine.  At the same time, I have learned to have a healthy skepticism about 
scientific claims.  Scientists are not immune to the lust for power, prestige, and 
wealth.  Overworked healthcare workers do not have the time to research all the data 
produced by pharmaceutical companies.
We are a Republic, with a constitution that limits the role of government so as to 
protect the individual and minorities from the excesses of a democracy which, 
unchecked by the rule of law according to our Constitution, inevitably leads to 
tyranny.    I pray you see the wisdom in minimizing government regulation and pass 
LD 51.
