I am for the proposed legislation to restore religious and philosophical exemptions to 
immunization requirements. Our healthcare system is broken and has led the "sheep" 
to slaughter. 
I worked as an RN in Massachusetts from 1986-1999 until moving to Maine. I 
followed all the rules and believed in the system, but not anymore. The original 
premise that I was taught was that removing liability for pharmaceutical companies 
from being sued for vaccine injuries would open up the door for development of cures
for devastating illnesses. That didn't happen. "Big Pharma"got richer. We were all 
kept "sick" and in need of their "life saving" and "life altering" drugs. The "Covid 
vaccine" was the eye opener for me. I have friends and family that have taken that 
shot and have suffered ill effects. One got Bell's palsy, one had vertigo, three had 
heart attacks, one had a fetus with severe defects. Can I prove that the "vaccine" was 
the cause? No. Do I have a strong suspicion? Yes!! what about all of the increases in 
cancer that are turning up left and right? 
Everyone has the right to make their own healthcare choices. It is not a government or
pharmaceutical company decision. We need to return to an honest healthcare system.  
Please consider ending all of these mandates.
