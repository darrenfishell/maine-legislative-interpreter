LD 51
I am writing in favor of LD 51. 
It is crucial to democracy that people can make decisions about their own health and 
bodies based on their philosophical and religious views. 
The right to abstain from vaccinations should never have been taken away. This bill 
will restore something crucial that Maine had lost.
No one should ever have the power over another to say what goes in their body.
