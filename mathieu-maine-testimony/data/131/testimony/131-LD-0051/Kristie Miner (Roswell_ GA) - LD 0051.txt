LD 51
I am writing in support of LD51.  Our family was forced out of Maine, our home for 
20 years, because of the removal of religious and philosophical exemptions.  We left 
in December of 2020 and our children are completing their high school education in 
Georgia.  The government should never coerce a medical procedure.
