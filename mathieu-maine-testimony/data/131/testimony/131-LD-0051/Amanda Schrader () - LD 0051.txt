Amanda Schrader
LD 51
Senator Raferty, Representative Brennan, and Members of the Education and Cultural
affairs Committee,
My name is Amanda Schrader, and I am from the town of Pembroke. I am testifying 
in support of LD51. I would also like to voice my support for LD869, LD 1098, 
LD1148, LD1209, LD1228.
I have 4 children right now affected by the law that does not allow for religious and 
philosophical exemptions. My oldest son, age 23, was in his Junior year for 
Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maine and my daughter, age 20, was in 
her sophomore year for Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maine. Both had
their accounts put on hold and are not allowed to sign up for any more classes at the 
University. 
My third son, age 18, has never been able to enroll in trade school to become an 
electrician. 
My youngest son, age 16, has not been able to attend high school which means he is 
missing out on AP classes, college prep classes, robotics clubs, sports, etc.. 
As of right now, my children have no future here in Maine to look to further their 
education. They have been pressed to have to decide if they will choose between 
education or their own private medical choices. They have chosen their own 
conscience over education. Education outside of their own state is a costly option. 
This has been distressing to say the least and has put us in some very hard positions. 
This law has marginalized people. Please uphold this basic human right that people 
already fought, blead and died for. People have the right to be educated with a clean 
conscience. Reinstate religious and philosophical exemptions. 
Thank you.
