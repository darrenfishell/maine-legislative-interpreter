Good morning, 
I am writing to you as a Maine mother and non-traditional student. There are many 
reasons to reinstate the vaccine exemptions, I will touch on two points here.
Medical freedom. As a non-traditional student, working towards my BS in Nursing, 
we were taught consent. You cannot treat someone without consent. We hear the term
"consent" in many aspects of society. Mandating ANY vaccine removes our ability to 
consent. How is it reasonable to teach consent, but then to remove it? Clearly, it is 
unreasonable.
The next point would be under Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Creating a 
vaccine mandate with no exemptions isolates those who will not, or cannot, take the 
mandated vaccine. In doing so you take from them the ability to attend school, work, 
public gatherings, etc. This is not a dystopian fantasy; this is what we've seen in 
reality here in our beloved state. 
To deny any exemptions is to deny Mainers their rights and freedoms. 
Mainers are smart, resilient, independent people. They do not need any mandates 
from a heavy-handed government to care for themselves or their families. 
Please do what is right for the freedom of all Mainers and reinstate Religious and 
Philosophical Exemptions. 
Best regard and thank you for your service.
