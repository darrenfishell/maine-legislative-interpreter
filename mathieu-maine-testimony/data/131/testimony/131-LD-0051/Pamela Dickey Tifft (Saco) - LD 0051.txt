I am a 70 year old woman who was vaccine injured by a flu shot when I was 24. My 
infant daughter was vaccine injured when she received her first DPT vaccine. We 
both have allergies to PEG, polyethylene glycol,  and aluminum which nobody even 
thought about when administering these vaccines. I am very well educated, I hold an 
MEd from Tufts University and I have been a life long democrat who has always been
concerned with freedom of choice and especially medical freedom of choice. As a 
result of these injuries I have spent my life researching and accessing alternative 
health care. There is just so much evidence that vaccine safety has never been a part 
of the equation which is why it is imperative that parents are able to make their own 
decisions about whether or not to vaccinate their babies and children.
