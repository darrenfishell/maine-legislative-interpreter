LD51, An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical Exemptions to Immunization Requirements, OUGHT 
TO PASS – IMMEDIATELY!!!! 
As a Pastor since 1996 I believe that LD51 is an official declaration of the ‘practiced in defiance’ rights 
and freedoms that were given to us by Nature’s God. That there should be no man or law that attempts 
to prohibit Maine citizens from enjoying these rights. The prior ACT that attempted to stop these 
freedoms is a ludicrous disaster and must be abolished. 
The removal of these religious and philosophical exemptions to immunization requirements has resulted 
in many families being forced to choose between their deeply held beliefs and their ability to access 
education, healthcare, and other essential services. As a result, dire health calamities have become the 
norm and we have created a cesspool environment that is festering with irreversible health issues.   
As a Pastor I am honestly angered about what has ensued in these last few years. It could have been 
thwarted!! This is a clear violation of our constitutional rights to the freedom of religion and freedom of 
conscience. Additionality as a retired military veteran with every shot in me under the sun, I am appalled 
by the way our liberties were stolen away from us. Let’s remove this domestic enemy, that is, this 
foolish law that attempted to steal our choice. 
This ACT is needed to be enacted forthwith with no debate and no veto. Restore this exemption. Restore 
Liberty 
Act Now
