My name is Cheri Farley. I was raised in healthcare, as my parents and grandparents 
owned and operated very nice nursing homes in several New England states 
throughout the years. At 15 years old I was trained and worked my whole summer as 
a Nurses Aide. Back then you weren’t certified but trained under very skilled Aides. 
There were no disposable briefs or gloves so I literally got my hands dirty, but I was 
proud to help the elderly. I eventually became a Registered Nurse and worked very 
hard for years and years. I loved my work for the most part. At age 66 I was “let go” 
because I choose not to get the experimental Covid vaccine. I’ve always taken good 
care of my health and trust in my God-given immune system. I left a really sweet 
position for my stage of life. Could actually have worked remotely, which I often did 
anyway. I do hope that this mandate gets overturned, but even if it does it’s already 
done me and my family irreparable damage. I lost my income for all this time and at 
my age, now 68, I would be hard pressed to find work that would be so well suited for
me.
Thank you for your good fight. I’m behind you and have donated when I can.
May God bless your efforts!
