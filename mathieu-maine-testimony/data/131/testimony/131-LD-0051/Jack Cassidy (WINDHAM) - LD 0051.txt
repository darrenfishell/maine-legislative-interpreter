LD 51
I would ask you to support LD 51 and Restore Religious and Philosophical 
Exemptions to Immunization Requirements. After what has happened these past 3 
years, we should have learned that forcing a substance on our children did nothing to 
stop the virus and did more harm to young children that the virus itself. Please restore 
the ability to have a Religious and Philosophical exemptions for immunizations in the 
state of Maine.
