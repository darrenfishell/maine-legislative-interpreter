LD 51
Dear Committee Chairs and members:
Please vote "ought to pass" on LD51. The state of Maine with LD798 violated the 
separation of church and state in our Federal Constitution and has the responsibility to
protect the peoples religious beliefs by protecting our rights. 
The scriptures are very specific about how those who practice Christianity should 
negate life. Ephesians 6:10-18 directs us to" Put on the armor of God" so that we can 
be equipped with truth, righteousness, peace and faith. When one listens to his 
conscience, the prudent man can hear God speaking. I am religiously and morally 
bound. My faith has been tested and strengthened during this tumultuous time.
I have dedicated my adult life to helping others in the medical field. Being a single 
mother with a mortgage, being fired based only upon my sincerely held religious 
beliefs was shocking to my soul and financially devastating. With my specific skill set
for which I went to college for , it was and still is impossible in the state of Maine to 
find employment that would even pay 70% of what I was making! I wasn't even 
allowed to go back to college to learn an alternative career without being vaccinated. 
Now, I do not even have the money to make money by learning a new trade in a 
college anywhere. I had to cash out money from my retirement account twice so far, 
with huge penalties to make ends meet and to keep my home. The passing of LD51 
would allow me to go back to helping people (my passion) as a Healthcare 
Professional in my field of expertise, earn a descent living and continue to live in 
Maine. Please vote" ought to pass" on LD51. It's time to do the right thing.
Thank you,
Kimberly Topar
