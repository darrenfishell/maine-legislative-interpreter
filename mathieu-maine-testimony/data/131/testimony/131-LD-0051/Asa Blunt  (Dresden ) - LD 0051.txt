To whom it may concern,
I am a 6th grade homeschooler and I am writing today in favor to restore religious and
philosophical exemptions. For the past three years,  I have been discriminated against 
and have lost my right to participate in local sports and activities.  This discrimination
has negatively impacted my mental health  in severe ways.  Restoring these 
exemptions would allow equal access to educational opportunities for all.
