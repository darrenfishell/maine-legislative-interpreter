Adeleine Trefts
Edinburg
LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished member of the 
committee, I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD51. 
My name is Adeleine Trefts. I am 15 years on and I am a freshman in high school. 
Since LD798 passed, I have missed out on school dances, sports, pep rallys and just 
the whole high school experience. 
I have drifted away from almost all of my childhood friends. I have dealt with anxiety
and depression. I can't even talk with people that I have known my whole life without 
getting anxious. I remember the morning my mom told me that my sisters and I 
weren't able to go to school. I sat there crying and hugging my mom. You don't know 
the effect of taking someone out of something they love until it happens to you. 
I will never be able to have an end of middle school party, or my first day of high 
school. It is so unfair that I didn't even get a choice to be homeschooled. I was just 
forced out of school because of my beliefs. 
I feel like I am not as smart as I was when I went to school. I now am expected to 
teach myself things I know nothing about. This law changed my life and not all in 
good ways. 
I miss going to school. I miss having to wake up early. I miss seeing my friends every
day. I miss having sports after school. I miss it all. 
If LD51 passes, I would be able to go back to school and do sports. I would be able to
go to an in-state college after graduation, unlike my sister. She had to graduate a year 
early in order to get her diploma and then had to move across the country to get her 
college education. 
Hopefully I would be able to gain back all of the friendships that I have lost since 
being out of public school. It would mean so much to me and my family for this bill 
to pass. Maybe it would mean that my sister would even come back to Maine to go to 
college. 
I would be beyond happy if I could go back to school. Please vote ought to pass on 
LD51.
