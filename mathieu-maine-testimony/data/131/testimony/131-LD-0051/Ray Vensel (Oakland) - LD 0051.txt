LD 51 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational & Cultural Affairs 
Committee, this is testimony AGAINST LD 51.  
Religious freedom is an essential right, but it is not a license to inflict harm on others. As the 
Supreme Court explained more than 75 years ago in Prince v. Massachusetts: “The right to 
practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to 
communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death.” Even a sincere request for a religious 
exemption should be denied if it puts the lives of others at risk. 
LD 51 directly endangers the public health and makes more deaths from disease inevitable. It 
tramples the rights of the most vulnerable, who should be able to participate in society without 
putting their health at grave risk.  
In addition to these risks, government has no realistic way to measure the sincerity of a claimed 
religious belief justifying an exemption from a rule which preserves public health. We don’t 
have to try to gauge sincerity if we simply recognize the obvious fact that religious freedom has 
limits. “Sincerity” does not justify putting others at risk. 
There is no blanket constitutional right to religious exemptions from public-health measures that 
apply to everyone. That includes religious exemptions from vaccination requirements, given the 
danger unvaccinated people pose to public health. 
LD 51 attacks public health measures by allowing vaccines to be avoided due to religious 
exemptions. Vaccines help to prevent the deaths of vulnerable populations, but only so long as 
people get vaccinated. By allowing religious exemptions to vaccines, diseases are able to evolve 
to become deadlier, or to avoid existing vaccines.  
 
Please protect public health, and don’t let this bill pass. Thank you.
