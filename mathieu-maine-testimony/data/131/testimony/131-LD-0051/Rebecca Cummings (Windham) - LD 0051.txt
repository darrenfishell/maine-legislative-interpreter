As a registered nurse in the state of Maine, and possessing over ten years of 
experience as an elementary school nurse, I SUPPORT medical and philosophical 
immunization exemptions. Individuals have a right to refuse medication(s). Patients 
cannot and should not be forced to take an experimental vaccine/medication only 
available under emergency use authorization for which our government LIED about 
there not being at least one known effective treatment. I urge this committee to restore
medical and philosophical exemptions effective immediately.
