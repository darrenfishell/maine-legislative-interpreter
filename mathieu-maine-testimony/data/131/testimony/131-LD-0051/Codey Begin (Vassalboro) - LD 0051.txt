LD 51
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you to vote ought to pass on LD 51.
I am in full support of LD51, for the following reasons:
1. I spent three years of my former life studying to become an Occupational Therapy 
Assistant in the state of Maine. When LD798 was enacted, I realized there would be 
very few job opportunities in the healthcare field where I would have full informed 
consent & bodily autonomy to make my own medical decisions - something I was 
taught as a standard of ethics in the healthcare field for patients themselves. I will not 
work in a field where I cannot choose what medical interventions I will receive. This 
violates not only my own core values, but also the ethics I was taught to respect and 
uphold in OT school. This law has directly affected my future career in the healthcare 
field. My years of study were all for nothing unless my right to opt-out is restored 
with LD51.
2. I have small children and this law has prevented them from access to daycare, 
preschool, and if it is still in place by the time they are school age, it will prevent their
access to all public & private educational opportunities. Their medical decisions 
should be made by their healthcare provider and parents, not government agencies or 
institutions in a one-size-fits-all schedule.
3. The former laws in place before LD798, allowed for freedom of choice as well as 
guidelines for keeping disease outbreaks out of schools. This has worked well for 
decades, and the new law has done nothing but exclude children and adults alike from
access to education and community support.
Though a lifelong resident of Maine, I have seriously considered leaving the state for 
one where our rights are respected and my family will have far more career and 
educational opportunities. I ask you to vote to pass LD51.
Sincerely,
Codey Begin
