Montville 
LD 51
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Louis Pontillo and I am writing today in support of LD 51. I live in 
Montville and I am a father of four.
Religious beliefs and practices are very personal things and much diversity can be 
found in practice even among members of the same congregations. This idea is 
expressed and supported by Article 3 of the Constitution of the State of Maine. Our 
sovereignty over our bodies is the most sacred gift of the Creator. The removal of our 
right to refuse any given pharmaceutical product is an affront to these values.
Please vote "Ought to pass" on LD51, and the other pieces of legislation being 
considered in today's hearing, and restore Freedom of Religion in the State of Maine.
Sincerely,
Louis M Pontillo
