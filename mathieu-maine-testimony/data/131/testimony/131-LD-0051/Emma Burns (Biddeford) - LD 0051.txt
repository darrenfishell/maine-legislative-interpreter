LD 51
Testimony in favor of LD 51, An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical 
Exemptions to Immunization Requirements
April 3, 2023 Public Hearing
My name is Emma Burns, a registered nurse, wife, mother, and homeowner here in 
the state of Maine. My family has been greatly impacted from the passing of LD 798. 
I am no longer able to work as a nurse in the state of Maine due to the above law. I'll 
be clear, I absolutely love being a nurse and will be back in a heartbeat if this is 
overturned. I am one more nurse, one more healthcare professional that is being kept 
away from staffing a state that already has a serious staffing issue.
My family is impacted as well. My children will be added to the numbers that will not
attend the school system here in Maine. 
Due to the limitations of LD 798, if nothing changes, we will plan to relocate to a 
state where we will have more freedom. Maine will lose yet another young family, 
two more healthcare professionals (my husband being a Nurse Anesthetist), and three 
beautiful children who will not be brought up here. 
Please vote in favor of LD 51. Please allow this loving nurse back to work in Maine, 
please keep a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist here in Maine, and please allow 
three young children to grow, thrive, and be the next generation here in Maine.
Thank you,
Emma Burns
