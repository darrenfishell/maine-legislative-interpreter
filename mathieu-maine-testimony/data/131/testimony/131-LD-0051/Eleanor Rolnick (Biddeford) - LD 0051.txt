There are many reasons why I think this bill should be passed but I will keep this brief
to just two. 
First, I believe that 'Freedom of Choice' should extend to anything that we choose or 
not choose to put in our bodies or that of our children's bodies.  Science and Medicine
are forever changing, evolving and learning.  What seem to be safe today may not be 
safe tomorrow, and we only learn this via the bodies that have been injured before 
change is made.  Since 2020 the scientific discourse has been skewed to one side only
and the ability of people to make informed choices has all but been removed.  
From a more personal and business standpoint, I lost a valued employee as she made 
the choice to home school her children rather than give them more vaccines.  Both of 
her children had been vaccine injured and she had good reasons to resist the mandate. 
She had been with me for almost 5 years, an important part of my office team.   This 
had a negative impact on my office structure until we were able to find a replacement 
for her.  I know I am not alone but amid many other employers who lost valued 
employees for the same reason over these past few years. 
I respectfully request that you pass this bill and give the rights back to the parents 
where they belong.
