LD 51
Dear Honorable Members of the Joint Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs.
My name is Tom Spitz and I live in Orono, Maine.
I ask you to declare LD 51and the other vaccine bills that you are considering today 
as ought not to pass. We lost over a million Americans to Covid -19 which proves 
how important vaccines are in our lives. This is a matter of public health and not a 
matter of religious freedom. We have a a separation between Religion and State.  I am
70 years old and have been required to have immunizations through out my life and 
did not  find it burdensome. We have grandchildren in the Orono schools and the 
required vaccines protect them, me and my community.  Thank you for reading my 
testimony and please declare these bills as ought not to pass.
