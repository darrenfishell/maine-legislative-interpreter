Ruth Schrader
Pembroke
LD 51
Sen. Rafarty, Rep. Brennan, and Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee,
My name is Ruth Schrader, and I am from Pembroke, Maine. I am testifying in 
support of L.D. 51, as well as L.D. 869, L.D. 1098, L.D. 1148, and L.D. 1229.
I have not been able to finish my college education at the University of Maine for 
mechanical engineering because of L.D. 798 removing my right to religious and 
philosophical exemptions. My family has had to deal with these same issues. Please 
reinstate religious and philosophical exemptions so that people like me can continue 
with our lives.
Thank you.
