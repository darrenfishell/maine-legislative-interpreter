LD 51
Dear members of Maine's Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, Please 
support LDs 51, 869, 1098, 1148, 1209 and 1228 this session. These bills would 
restore religious and philosophical
 exemptions to vaccines and prevent COVID-19 vaccination requirements in Maine's 
public and private school systems, protecting education access for all children in 
Maine. Maine and national public health officials lied and misled the public during 
the COVID-19
 pandemic about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Today, the data are clear that 
COVID-19 poses little risk to school-aged children, and this population has little to 
benefit from COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, the authorized COVID-19 vaccines 
do not stop people from contracting the disease or transmitting it to others. Despite 
these facts, public health officials used fear and panic to cajole education institutions 
to mandate these products on staff and students. This should never be allowed to 
happen again.Implementing a mandate today is akin to kicking tens of thousands of 
students out of Maine's education system. Please learn from the mistakes of the 
pandemic and support LDs 51, 869, 1098, 1148, 1209, and 1228 this session. 
I have been a nurse for 33 years. I worked hard and was proud of my work. October 
2021 I was cancelled/terminated/discarded from my supervisory position because my 
God given right to refuse a vaccine was not available to me. This was life 
changing/life altering. But my children, grandchildren, family and friends have seen a 
strength in me they didn't know existed. It gave them hope for something more 
outside of themselves. Wont you extend a hand of kindness back to the people and 
offer hope that all is not lost?
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Terry Poland
