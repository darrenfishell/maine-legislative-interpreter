LD 51
I am strongly opposed to LD51 and the five other bills under consideration to increase
the ability to get waivers from current vaccine requirements. Religious and 
philosophical exemptions should not be allowed to supersede the rights of other 
Maine children to avoid being exposed to dangerous illnesses in their public schools.
Evidence shows that vaccines work, and are safe and effective at reducing the number
of serious illnesses Maine's children get. In March, 2020, Maine voters 
overwhelmingly chose to support closing loopholes on vaccine exemptions. That vote
spoke loudly as to the support for a science-based approach to vaccine requirements 
to keep our kids safe.
Please oppose all of these bills.
