April 11, 2023 Testimony of Rep. Marc Malon Supporting LD 1358, An Act to Clarify Density Requirements for Affordable Housing Developments Before the Joint Select Committee on Housing Good afternoon Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and honorable members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing. My name is Marc Malon and I proudly represent House District 133, which is part of the great city of Biddeford. I am here today to testify in support of LD 1358, An Act to Clarify Density Requirements for Affordable Housing Developments, and would like to thank Representative Kuhn for introducing this bill.  LD 1358 provides an important clarification to the law passed by the Legislature in 2022, Public Law 672 (LD 2003), by removing the phrase “that the developer designates as affordable” from the section of the law pertaining to density bonuses. The practical effect of this change clarifies that a majority of the units must be affordable, with “affordable” defined as no more than 30 percent of the household’s monthly income.  The committee should be aware that I have proposed the same change in a forthcoming bill of mine, which will also include other important revisions to the law passed last session. I encourage you to support this change when it comes up in the work session. It is a necessary fix to ensure that we are encouraging more affordable housing.
