Testimony In Support Of  
L.D. 1358 , An Act to Clarify Density Requirements for Affordable Housing Developments  
 
April 11, 2023  
 
Senator Pierce , Representative Gere , and distinguished members of the Joint Select Committee 
on Housing , my name is Greg Payne,  and I serve as  the Senior Advisor on Housing  Policy  in the 
Governo r’s Office o f Policy Innovation and the Future. I am here today to offer testimony in 
support of  L.D. 1358 , An Act to Clarify Density Requirements for Affordable Housing 
Developments.  
 
This bill proposes a simple change to the law resulting from the passage of L.D. 200 3 last year. 
The way this sentence was drafted did not quite capture legislative  intent. The intent was to 
require that a majority  of the units in development s benefitting from the density bonus provision 
be affordable to those with low to moderate incomes . However, the language as drafted  makes it 
appear as though the developer can determine how many units must  meet this requirement . 
 
This a straightforward revision and makes clear how many units need to be affordable in order 
for the development to  qualify for the density bonus.  
 
Thank you for consideration and I’d be happy to answer any questions.
