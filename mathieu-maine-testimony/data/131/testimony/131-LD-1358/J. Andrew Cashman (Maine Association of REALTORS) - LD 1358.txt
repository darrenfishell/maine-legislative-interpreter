 Testimony in Support of LD 1358 (“An Act to Clarify Density Requirements for Affordable Housing Developments”)   J. Andrew Cashman on behalf of the Maine Association of REALTORS®  April 11, 2023  Senator Pierce, Representative Gere and members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing, my name is Andy Cashman. I am the Founder of Resolve Government Relations. We represent the Maine Association of REALTORS®, a professional trade association established in 1936 with over 6,500 members statewide. REALTORS® grow Maine’s economy and build Maine communities. Our members represent buyers and sellers involved in both residential and commercial real estate transactions. Our membership also includes industry affiliates, such as lenders, closing agents, title agents, appraisers, building inspectors, surveyors, etc. The Maine Association is chartered by the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR), the largest trade association in the country.   The Maine Association of REALTORS® supports LD 1358. The bill clarifies the definition of “affordable housing development” by removing the requirement that a developer make a designation, instead setting a standard when certain income qualifications are met. This means that more developments will be considered affordable, and the process will be streamlined. In doing so, higher density development can occur and the addition of more affordable housing units to the market will allow more Maine residents to live independently in housing that is safe and affordable to them.   For these reasons, we support LD 1358 and respectfully urge you to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time and consideration.
