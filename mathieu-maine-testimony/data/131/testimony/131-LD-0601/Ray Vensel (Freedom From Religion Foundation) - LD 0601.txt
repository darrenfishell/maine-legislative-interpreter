LD 601 
 
Members of the Health and Human Services Committee, this is testimony AGAINST LD 601.  
LD 601 directly endangers the public health and makes more deaths from disease inevitable. It 
tramples the rights of the most vulnerable, who should be cared for by EMT crews who are 
immunized so as to avoid additional health risks.   
LD 601 creates additional medical risks for patients who are, by definition, already in a condition 
threatening their health and wellbeing. Vaccines help to prevent the deaths of vulnerable 
populations, but only so long as people get vaccinated. By allowing exemptions to vaccines, 
diseases are able to evolve to become deadlier, or to avoid existing vaccines. And to allow this to 
happen within Emergency Medical Services Personnel is increasing the risk to a vulnerable 
population.  
 
Please protect public health, and donâ€™t let this bill pass. Thank you.
