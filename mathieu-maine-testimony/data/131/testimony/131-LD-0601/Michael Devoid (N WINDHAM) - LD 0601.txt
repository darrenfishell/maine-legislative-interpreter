I was forced to take these to keep my job and have irreversible damage to my liver 
and blood work highest ever. I have my blood work done annually and have been 
consistent after being forced to take these I was tired for 2 months similar to mono as 
a kid, had blood work done and was 10x higher on many different items tested then 
ever before. My Dr was perplexed as they didn't jive as when certain levels elevated 
others do or drop in conjunction. His only ideas was "well we will monitor" they are 
coming down but many remain high. I was forced to take something I didn't want as 
flu shots do not go well for me either. The years I get them I feel run down for weeks 
and get sicker then the years I do not get them and have not had a flu shot in 8 years 
but in one of the business services in the state. I will take my natural immunity. Not 
every medication works the same on everyone let people decide what is best for 
themselves not forced by government or employer.
