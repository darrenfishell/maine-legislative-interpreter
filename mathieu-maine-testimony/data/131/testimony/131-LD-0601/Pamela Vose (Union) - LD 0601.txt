Pamela Vose
Union
LD 601
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident of Union, Maine.
I am writing in opposition to LD 601.  I believe that this is a misguided politically 
motivated bill which will negatively impact the health of the vulnerable people these 
workers serve.  The way to increase the number of these vital workers is to increase 
pay and provide better benefits, not put the vulnerable people they serve at risk for 
political purposes.  
I strongly urge you to vote ought not to pass.
