In Opposition of LD 601 
“An Act to Reduce the Shortage of Municipal Emergency Medical Services Personnel by 
Removing Certain Vaccination Requirements ” 
Presented by  Representative Moriarty of Cumberland  
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES  
Public Hearing: April 24, 2023 , at 10 AM  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human  Services : 
 
My name is Sam Hurley , and I am the Director of Maine Emergency Medical Services, Maine 
EMS, within the Department of  Public Safety.  I am testifying  on behalf of Maine Department of 
Public Safety and Maine EMS  in opposition  of LD 601, "An Act to Reduce the Shortage of 
Municipal Emergency Medical Services Personnel by Removing Certain Vaccination 
Requirements .” 
 
In 2021, the Maine Board of Emergency Medical Services established an emergency rule 
entitled, “COVID -19 Immunization Requirements Emergency Rule.” This rule expired on 
November 21, 2021. After multiple rounds of rulemaking and with considerable public 
comment , the Board adopted final rules on June 1 , 2022, entitled, “Chapter 21: Immunization 
Requirements.” These rules require licensed emergency medical services entities and training 
centers to ensure that all persons providing direct patient care are either immu nized for COVID -
19 and seasonal influenza based on the recommendations from the US Centers for Disease 
Page 2 of 5 
 Control and Prevention  or hold a valid medical exemption . These rules were created in alignment 
with the rules established by the Maine Center for Diseas e Control and Prevention regarding 
required immunizations for healthcare professionals , except that the Maine EMS  Board’s  rule 
only include s COVID -19 and seasonal influenza immunization.1  
 
During the rulemaking process  for both Chapter 20 (Emergency Rule) and Chapter 21 the 
permanent rule, the Board heard from  over 70  stakeholders  regarding the immunization 
requirements. The Board conducted  extensive review of the available information, materials , and 
rulemaking feedbac k, and consulted with experts throughout the state including the Medical 
Direction and Practices Board  (MDPB) . The MDPB  is a Board within the Maine EMS 
infrastructure comprised of 11 Maine -based physicians, two EMS clinicians, and a licensed 
pharmacist. Additionally, the Board considered their specific statutory charge to :  
 
… promote and provide for a comprehensive and effective emergency medical services 
system to ensure optimum patient care … [and]  promote the public health, safety and 
welfare by provid ing for the creation of a statewide emergency medical services system 
with standards for all providers of emergency medical services .2 
 
Based on all these factors, the  Board determined that it was in the best interest of the public’s 
health, safety, and w elfare to institute immunization requirements with the intention of protecting 
the existing workforce and the public that they are serving daily. Emergency personnel respond 
to individuals who are already sick or injured and therefore are at increased risk  of developing 
complications secondary to COVID -19 and influenza infections.  
 
Maine EMS and the Board have always sought to remain cognizant of the potential impact of 
rulemaking on the EMS workforce and  its capacity to deliver emergency services throughout the 
state. To understand the impact of the rulemaking, the Maine EMS Office has monitored the 
number of EMS clinicians that have  been  documented within our statewide electronic patient 
care reporting (ePCR ) system each month. If looking  at the data presented in Figure 1, one will  
see the count of unique EMS clinicians documented on ePCRs in Maine by month and year. We

 have also identified the dates where each of the immunization requirements were enacted 
(Chapter 20, the emergency rule; and Chapter 21, the final rule)  on the graph for your reference. 
Looking at this graph,  one can see  that following the implementation of the emergency rule 
(Chapter 20) in August 2021, there was a slight decrease in the number of unique clinicians 
documenting in the ePCRs ; however, by the end of 2022, there were more EMS clinicians 
charting  throughout th e state  than ever before.

Source Information: This data was collected based on unique license numbers appearing on Maine EMS patient care 
reports within the electronic patient care reporting system , Maine EMS and Fire Incident Reporting S ystem  
(MEFIRS). These values likely represent an underestimate of the number of clinicians operating in the system 
because some clinicians that respond  to a call that are inadvertently left off the patient care report.  
 
As Maine’s popu lation increases each summer, so do the number of EMS clinicians and EMS 
calls, w e have attempted to adjust  for these fluctuations by correcting  for seasonality. Figure 2 
provides a single line showing the difference in count of clinicians between each month and a 
four-year average for that same month over the 2019 -2022 period . This means that the 
differences you see are between the number of practicing EMS clinicians identified on an ePCR 
each month, and the four -year average  for that month . The data point labels  [XX, XX%]  call out 
the difference s in the count of clinicians and the percent difference from the four -year average . 
Looking  at Figure 2 , one can see that  after the  August 23, 2021 , implementation of the COVID -255026002650270027502800285029002950

 19 immunization requirements by emergency rulemaking , there were less than 50 fewer EMS 
clinicians  as compared to the four -year average  for that same month or approximately a 2% 
decrease in practicing clinicians at any month to month comparison  following implementation . 
The most recent data suggests that we are seeing a positive trend in the number of EMS 
clinicians participating in EMS clinical care  (see the linear trendline  overlay on Figure 2) .

Source Information: The labels are formatted with [COUNT, PERCENT CHANGE] for each data point on the 
graph. The percent change is calculated based on the number of clinicians for each month and year as compared to 
an average of the number of clinicians act ive in that same month over a four-year period (2019 -2022). This data was 
collected based on unique license numbers appearing on Maine EMS patient care reports within the electronic 
patient care reporting system, Maine EMS and Fire Incident Reporting S ystem (MEFIRS). These values likely 
represent an underestimate of the number of clinicians operating in the system because there may be some clinicians 
that respond to a call via their personal vehicles or in addition to the transporting ambulance crew that ar e 
inadvertently left off the patient care report.  
 
In May of 2020, Maine EMS implemented a reporting requirement for all EMS and emergency 
medical dispatch  (EMD)  entities to disclose positive COVID -19 cases  and hospitalizations  
within the workforce. This w as instrumental in monitoring the health of the existing EMS 
workforce and the impact of COVID -19 infection.  However, it also has provided insight into the -43, -2%55, 2%

 efficacy of COVID -19 immunizations at preventing hospitalizations with three licensees being 
hospita lized prior to implementation of the immunization requirement and none  after August 23, 
2021 (date of the emergency rule implementation).   
 
Ultimately, the position of Maine EMS is that the authority to institute immunization 
requirements should remain wholly vested with the Board. The statutorily -defined purpose of the 
Board is to, “ promote the public health, safety and welfare ” of all persons functioning within and 
interacting with the EMS system in Maine.3 While we understand that there are some EMS 
clinicians who chose to leave the EMS workforce rather than obtaining COVID -19 
immunization, the data does not suggest that immunization requirements have had deleterious 
effects on the long -term numbers of EMS clinicians working within the field. Additionally, the 
immunization requirements  appear to have  been successful at limiting the impact of COVID -19-
related hospitalization  on the EMS workforce.  
 
Maine EMS requests that the Committee vote  Ought Not to Pass based on this information and 
continue to empower the Maine EMS Board with the authority and responsibility to protect and 
“promote the [public’s] health, safety and welfare.”4 
 
Please feel free to reach out to me anytime  if there is any additional information that  I can offer  
the Committee .
