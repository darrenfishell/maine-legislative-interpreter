Memorandum of Support  
Date:  April 24, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Health and Human Services  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 601 - An Act to Reduce the Shortage of Municipal Emergency Medical Services Personnel by 
Removing Certain Vaccination Requirements 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 601 - An Act to Reduce the Shortage of 
Municipal Emergency Medical Services Personnel by Removing Certain Vaccination Requirements 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell, and I'm from Sanford. 
 
As you may be aware, the COVID vaccine has been shown to not provide immunity to COVID or provide any 
significant benefit. Studies are also showing other negative side effects such as increased rates of myocarditis, 
and other uncommon conditions.  
 
Maine is in dire need of healthcare workers, and over 20% were illegally fired for refusal to take an experimental 
vaccine. Informed consent was not followed, which means workers should have had a choice.  
 
Please support this bill as we need to put healthcare workers back to work. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
