LD 601
Dear Members of the HHS Committee,  
I am writing in regards to ~ LD 601: "An Act to Reduce the Shortage of Municipal 
Emergency Medical Services Personnel by Removing Certain Vaccination 
Requirements"
This bill allows emergency medical services persons to provide treatment within the 
scope of their licenses without having been vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus or
the influenza virus.
Please use common sense and support this LD 601, it makes sense, for the people of 
Maine, since so many are at risk of not receiving the emergency treatment they need, 
at this time.  
 Emergency workers need to be working again, and having a right to be gainfully 
employed.   See Articles 1 and 3 of the Maine Constitution.  
Vote "ought to pass" on LD 601
Sincerely, 
Renee Fortin
