Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, Members of the Committee on the Judiciary :  
 
On behalf of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association, I am writing to the  Committee in support 
of LD 243, "An Act to Eliminate Residency Requirements for District Court Judic ial 
Appointments." The act will help to ensure that rural districts of Maine have a r obust pool of 
qualified judicial applicants.  
 
In a perfect world, Maine's existing law, which establishes residenc y requirements for district 
judge appointments, would be an essential factor in ensuring the geographic di versity of the 
bench. However, Maine's bar is not immune from the same demographic trends towar d 
urbanization that influence Maine's population as a whole.  Our association ha s received 
feedback from individuals involved in the judicial nomination process indicating that  
decreasing attorney populations in some rural districts have seriously i mpacted the pool of 
available applicants for nomination to the district court. Unfortunately, this  trend is likely to 
continue and may result in difficulty filling open judicial slots in rural dist ricts and adversely 
affecting access to justice in those counties.  
 
LD 243 reflects the changing demographics of Maine and of Maine's bar.  The  act will allow a 
strong pool of judicial applicants to fulfill judicial vacancies. The Le gislature would continue 
its oversight of judicial nominations through its confirmation process to ensure t hat geographic 
diversity of the bar remains a goal, even if that goal is not perfectly o btainable. LD 243 is a 
practical solution to permit the administration of justice in rural areas  of Maine.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Susan Faunce, Esq.  
President
