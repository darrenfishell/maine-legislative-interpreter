Pete Harring
Washington
LD 243
Senator Anne Carney, Representative Matt Moonen and distinguished members of the
Committee on Judiciary,
My name is Pete Harring from Washington, ME. I am not a lobbyist or a member of any 
special interests group.  I come to you today to ask that you vote “Ought NOT to Pass” on LD 
243 “An Act To Eliminate Residency Requirements for District Court Judicial Appointments”
This bill could potentially allow our Courts to be stacked by activist judges not representative 
of Maine as a whole. 
Thank you for your time, and I respectfully ask that you vote
“Ought NOT to Pass.”
May you all have a Blessed day.
Pete Harring
