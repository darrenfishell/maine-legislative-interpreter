Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary my name is Gina LeDuc-Kuntz and l am a resident of Freeport, Maine. 
I am submitting my written testimony in opposition to LD 243, “An Act To Eliminate Residency 
Requirements for District Court Judicial Appointments. ” 
Historically, the Maine State Legislature has held that appointed Maine District Courtjudges be 
required to hold residency within the districts they serve. 
In my opinion, this practice sen/es to ensure diverse geographical regions within Maine are fairly 
represented within the judicial branch by appointed judges familiar with the communities where 
they serve. 
Changing this long standing tradition that has required residency for a Judge’s appointment toa 
particular District Court will open Maine communities to lopsided representation within the 
judiciary leaving Maine communities with even less voice in their district judiciary process ina 
system where judges are appointed and not elected to the communities in which they serve. 
Please protect Maine communities by voting “ought not to pass” on LD243. 
Thank You, 
Gina LeDuc-Kuntz 
Freeport, Maine
