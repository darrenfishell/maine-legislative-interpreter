LD 243
I am submitting testimony in opposition to bill LD-243, An Act To Eliminate Residency 
Requirements for District Court.
To whom it may concern,
I believe it is important to have a government close to the people, the closer the better. I have
lived in the Shire towns of Machias, Houlton, and now Wiscasset. Appointing a judge that is a 
resident ensures local knowledge and keeps in place the relationships in the judicial 
community that have been developed over years. Allowing the Governor to appoint judges 
from “away” would allow the appointment of WOKE Judges from CD-1 to rule the more 
Conservative CD-2 counties. This means judicial engineering from Augusta and more 
opportunity for nepotism. Passage of this bill moves justice further away from the people it is 
supposed to serve. I urge a vote of ought not to pass.
