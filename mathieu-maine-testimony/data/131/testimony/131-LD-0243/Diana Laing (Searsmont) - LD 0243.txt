LD 243
Senator CARNEY and members of the Judiciary Committee, I, Diana Laing from 
Searsmont, would like to state that I oppose the proposed bill LD243. The purpose of 
the current law is to have local judges. There should be an adequate pool of lawyers in
each district to choose from. Thank you and I hope you apply fairness over 
partisanship
