LD 243
I oppose LD 243, “An Act To Eliminate Residency Requirements for District Court 
Judicial Appointments”.
The bill seeks to eliminate residency requirements for Maine District Court Judges 
appointed by the Governor stating “this bill removes the requirements regarding 
residency for District Court judge appointments.” This bill will potentially allow our 
Courts to be stacked by activists judges from Portland or other Maine communities 
not representative of Maine as a whole. It is nothing but a partisan attempt to pack the
districts with “cherry picked”, liberal judges.
Again, I oppose LD 243, “An Act To Eliminate Residency Requirements for District Court 
Judicial Appointments,” and it “ought not to pass”.
