Testimony of Senator Anne Carney introducing 
LD 243, An Act To Eliminate Residency Requirements for District Court 
Judicial Appointments 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
February 9, 2023 
Representative Moonen and Esteemed colleagues on the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, 
as you know, I am Anne Carney, proudly representing Senate District 29, which includes South 
Portland, Cape Elizabeth, and part of Scarborough. Today I am pleased to introduce a Judicial 
Branch bill, LD 243, “An Act To Eliminate Residency Requirements for District Court Judicial 
Appointments. ” 
The Maine District Court has 38 judges who hold court at approximately 30 locations throughout 
Maine. These locations are organized into in 13 districts. The District Court hears civil, criminal 
and family matters and always sits without a jury. Current law requires one or two judges to 
reside in each of the 13 districts, but it has become challenging to maintain these residency 
requirements as judges and their families move or as judges retire and the need to ﬁll a vacancy 
occurs. 
In order to ensure that our state can appoint District Court Judges to ﬁll vacancies and provide 
coverage as needed to each court location for scheduled civil, criminal and family matters, the 
Judicial Branch seeks to amend the law to eliminate residency requirements. 
At this time, I would like to tum things over to the Judicial Branch. I know that they are prepared 
to provide testimony, as Well as answer your questions about the bill. 
Thank you for your consideration and time.
