Testimony of Representative Suzanne Salisbury in support of 
LD 1751, An Act to Maximize Federal Funding in Support of Emergency 
Medical Services 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and esteemed members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Health and Human Services, my name is Sue Salisbury. I represent House District 128, 
which is part of the town of Westbrook. I am happy to offer testimony in support of LD 1751, 
An Act to Maximize Federal Funding in Support of Emergency Medical Services.  
 
This past year, as the Blue-Ribbon Commission to study Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in 
Maine met, we heard over and over again that one of the biggest barriers facing emergency 
medicine services across Maine is inadequate reimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid.  
 
Below is a segment of a graph produced by the Blue Ribbon Commission report1 estimating the 
difference between the cost-per-call and reimbursement-per-call:  
 
 
 
Cost per call varies statewide with the biggest variable being the overall number of calls a 
service responds to. According to findings from the commission, cost per call is much greater for 
services with low call volume, the reimbursement per call remains the same, and even for those 
services with the greatest call volume, the reimbursement is still not sufficient to cover the costs. 
The process of determining reimbursement rates through Medicare and Medicaid is antiquated

and woefully inadequate, and it is made worse in a state as rural and geographically diverse as 
Maine.  
 
Maine cannot wait for a federal study on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates which 
could take four to five years. The changes proposed in this bill will go a long way towards 
addressing the funding gap that services are facing, allowing services to rely less on volunteer 
workers and municipal subsidies.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on this critical component of our EMS 
workforce shortage solution.
