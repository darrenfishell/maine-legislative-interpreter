Testimony in Support of LD 1751 “An Act to Maximize Federal Funding in Support of 
Emergency Medical Services” 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services: 
I write to you on behalf of the City of Portland’s Legislative/Nominating Committee in Support 
of LD 1751, An Act to Maximize Federal Funding in Support of Emergency Medical Services. 
The recent Blue Ribbon Commission on Emergency Medical Services found that EMS 
agencies across Maine are in dire need of intervention. Without support, we can expect to see 
agencies close, leaving areas of the state unserved or poorly served and placing additional 
burdens on property taxpayers. 
LD 1751 will provide much needed financial relief to EMS services across our state of every 
service type (Private, Non-Profit, Municipal, and Hospital) and builds a model that will be 
sustainable. By increasing MaineCare reimbursements to 200% of Medicare we will draw 
additional payments of nearly $32 million, of which less than $12 million will be the 
responsibility of Maine, the remainder comes from the 2/3 match of the federal government. 
By implementing LD 1751, the State can provide much needed financial relief to EMS 
providers, ensuring they can continue to deliver critical emergency services to Maine's 
communities.  
Thank you for your consideration.
