Neither For Nor Against  
 
LD 1530  - An Act to Support Patients by Permitting On- site Consumption of Medical Cannabis and 
Medical Cannabis Products  
 
April 19, 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, and I am providing testimony neither for nor against LD 1530  
on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee 
(LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position 
on bills of municipal interest.    
The LPC will b e discussing LD 1 530 at their next meeting scheduled for tomorrow, April 20 and 
have yet to take a position. MMA will plan to submit additional testimony based on the outcome of that 
discussion in advance of the work session.  
Thank  you for your time and considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
