Re: LD 1530 — An Act to Support Patients by Permitting On-site Consumption of Medical 
Cannabis and Medical Cannabis Products 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans 
and Legal Affairs: 
I am John Hudak, Director of the Office of Cannabis Policy (OCP) and I am before you today to 
provide testimony on behalf of our ofﬁce in opposition to LD 1530. In light of the introduction 
of Senator Chipman’s bill, LD 1446, to establish a task force to study on-premises consumption, 
We would recommend that the issue of on-premises consumption by medical cannabis patients be 
added to the issues discussed by that task force. 
As we indicated at the hearing for LD 839, the adult use program version of this bill, we have 
substantial concerns regarding the introduction of on-premises consumption to Maine’s regulated 
cannabis markets. We continue to have serious concerns about the public health and safety 
impacts of permitting on-premises consumption of cannabis, regardless of whether it is medical 
or adult use, related to indoor air quality in light of the Workplace Smoking Act of 1985; 
cannabis server training and business liability related to the over-service of individuals 
consuming cannabis on-site; and the consequences of driving under the inﬂuence of cannabis. 
Upon reﬂection, and the introduction of LD 1446, we would recommend that the issues outlined 
above be added to the scope of review for the on-premises consumption task force. While the 
introduction of on-premises consumption to the adult use and medical cannabis program may be 
motivated by different policy objectives, they engage inherently similar if not identical activities. 
As such, they involve identical and critical public health and safety concerns and should be 
studied by that task force before new state policy is designed enacted. 
As always, we thank you for your time and we’ll do our best to answer any questions you may 
have.
