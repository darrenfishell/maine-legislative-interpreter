l support of Id 1530 on-site consumption medical cannabis. 
Senator Hickman and Representative Supica and honorable members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee, good morning and thank you for hosting this hearing. 
I support patients and adults 21 and over being able to attend social events and consume 
cannabis. There is no reason that responsible consumption of cannabis cannot be managed 
similarly to responsible consumption of alcohol. This would create another revenue stream for 
struggling restaurants. Combustible consumption could occur in open air arras or in filtered 
indoor settings. Attendance could be informed and people could choose whether or not to 
attend a social club. By providing a legal area for consumption, those who do not care to 
consume cannabis or be near it can also choose their comfort level of exposure from no 
exposure to indulgence. 
With our current denial that people are using cannabis and our drug war attempts to keep it 
hidden and secret, we do.more damage. There is no risk to public safety by managing and 
enforcing reasonable laws in regard to consumption. Denial of the existence of the use of 
cannabis is not making it go away. 
Combustible and non-combustible cannabis ought be allowed on-site at regulated venues. This 
is like the elephant in the room - the speakeasy thing is getting old. Please deem ld 1530 ought 
to pass. Thank you for your time.
