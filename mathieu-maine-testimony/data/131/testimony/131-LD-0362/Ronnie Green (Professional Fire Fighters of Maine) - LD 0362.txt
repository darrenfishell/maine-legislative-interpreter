LD 362 "An Act to Clarify Coverage for Retired County and Municipal Law Enforcement 
Officers and Municipal Fireﬁghters Under the State Employer Group Health Plan" 
February 16, 2023 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services. My name is Ronnie Green and I reside in the town 
of Plymouth. 
I am currently a District Vice President with the Professional Fire Fighters of Maine representing 
well over 1000 full-time, career Fireﬁghters, EMT’s Paramedics, inspectors, dispatchers, and 
mechanics across the State of Maine who belong to the International Association of Fire 
Fighters. 
I am here today to speak in support of LD 3 62 "An Act to Clarify Coverage for Retired County 
and Municipal Law Enforcement Oﬁicers and Municipal Fireﬁghters Under the State Employer 
Group Health Plan" 
This was program was established by the l22“d Maine Legislature and was the result ofa 
statewide growing problem of ﬁreﬁghters and law enforcement ofﬁcers working well past their 
retirement age simply because they could not afford health insurance in retirement. The program 
started in 2007 and did what it was intended to do, give relief to those ﬁrst responders so they 
could retire and get some help with health insurance costs. Unlike any other health insurance 
subsidy, We pay into the program while we are working much like we do to any retirement 
program. 
As the years went on, and no different than any other new program, we found glitches, and 
bumps in the road that we were able to resolve in the 129"‘ Legislature with LD 1674 
http:f/wwwmainelegislatureorgllegis/bills/getPDF .asp?pap~er=SPG545&item=3&snum= I 29. 
At that same time we created an Advisory Board (or Council) consisting of stakeholders that 
constantly monitor the program to make sure it is working efﬁciently. One of the issues we 
found throughout our work was an inconsistency in the statute governing the program Title 5, 
Sec 286 https:/'/ ‘ wyvw.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/5/title ﬁsiec286-l ‘vi.html (see 6C), and the 
statute that identiﬁes who is allowed to participate in the State Employees Group Health Plan 
under Title 5, Sec 285 https://wwwmaineiegistature.org/legis/statutes/5/title5see2S5html .
This proposed legislation does not create anything new, does not cost any money, does not allow 
any new groups of people, it simply makes a correction and a clariﬁcation that should have been 
done years ago. 
I have included along with my written testimony a copy of an email from Kurt Caswell from the 
Office of Employee Health & Wellness, and a member of the Advisory Board suggesting the 
change. 
I would like to thank Senator Baldacci for bringing this matter forward, and I would urge this 
committee to vote it out “Ought To Pass”. 
Thank You for your time and I will be happy to answer any questions.

Subject: Potential Statute Updates 
Ronnie- 
Per FFLEO Advisory Council discussion this AM re: getting statutory language in sync, I wanted to provide 
you as early as possible the most fundamental eligibility language that is important to have updated. I 
am including Anya Trundy, EH&W’s legislative liaison, as she has been instrumental in getting previous 
statutory edits in place. 
Within Title 5, Sec 285 ( httpj/WWW.maineiegisiature.org) ’legEsfstatutes/5/titEe5sec285.ittmi) the 
following sub-sections should be updated: 
0 A new sub-section "M" be added (see newest section L associated town academy eligibility as an 
example) for eligible participants of the FFFEO retirement program. 
0 Updates should be made to sub-section 1-B. ineligibility. Although the language here calls out 
“members of the Maine Municipal Association and employees of counties and municipalities 
and instrumentalities thereof, ” as being ineligible with specificity to ”empIoyees of counties and 
municipalities ” , editing this language to provide for exception to eligible FFLEO program 
enrollees is necessary, especially in light of the issue of a FFLEO retiree returning to work as an 
active employee for a different municipality. 
We are continuing to review SOM group health plan provisions so we can be clear on rules that may 
impact the administration ofthe FFLEO group retirement program, and we will provide additional 
information prior to our next FFLEO Advisory Council meeting. 
Let me know if you questions, and please feel free to forward this to your Advisory Council colleagues; I 
don't have their email addresses immediately available to me. 
Thanks
