Good Morning Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and 
distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety. I am Representative Kathy Javner of Chester, and I proudly represent House 
District 29 which includes several small towns and townships in the northern part of 
Penobscot County. 
In the 130th legislature, it was brought to my attention that the Penobscot County 
Sheriffs Department was struggling due to an expiring agreement with the Maine State 
Police. Penobscot County is much more than the better known populated areas 
surrounding Brewer, Hermon, & Bangor but also reaches some of the most rural parts of 
our state which are in desperate need of constant coverage from emergency services; 
especially from our Sheriff Department. 
While funding positions would ﬁll many gaps throughout Penobscot County, first 
and foremost this bill is about public safety. I want to be very clear that living in a rural 
area does not exclude the need for emergency services in a timely 1’I1€lI1I161‘. 
Should an emergency arise, a resident of rural Penobscot county should have the 
same expectation for a response that is comparable to more populated areas. 
If you haven’t been to the Lincoln Lakes or Katahdin Region recently, I invite 
you to take a ride up 95. You’ll experience some of the most beautiful views in our state 
and you will deﬁnitely get a clearer picture of the challenges facing our Sheriffs 
Department as they Work to keep all of our neighborhoods safe. 
I urge you to join me in supporting LD 756, to ensure safety for Penobscot County, and 
the entire state of Maine. 
Sincerely, X .
