Re: LD 366- An Act to Promote Workforce Development  
 
 
While I cannot attend today’s public hearing, I am send ing this letter to provide additional information on LD 366 . 
The Department is Neither For Nor Against this bill.  
From th e draft  presented to the Department late last we ek, we understand that the sponsor, Senator Curry , 
directs the Maine Department of Labor to develop a financial impact calculation tool and workforce impact 
calculation tool, for use on i ts publicly accessible website.   
 
Regarding LD 366 as proposed, we must  state at the outset that there is no funding  in the Governor’s budget to 
support development or implementation of this tool as described.  That said,  since 2019  the Department is proud 
to have been  working in collaboration with Maine DHHS , the Maine Whole Family Approach to Jobs Initiative 
(supported by the John T. Gorman Foundation) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on the development of a 
Career Ladder Identifier and Financial Forecaster (CLIFF) tool .   
 
The CLIFF  suite of tools developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta models the interaction of public 
benefits, taxes, and tax credits with wage progressions. The CLIFF suite currently includes three core tools, each 
tailored to meet a client’s needs in different career stages.   
• “CLIFF Snapshot” tool that allows someone to compare their current wages/hours  to possible alternative 
scenarios including higher wages/more hours , and what happens to their overall financial picture  
• “CLIFF Dashboard ” tool that allows for l ong term  career  planning  over a 20 -year -plus horizon. The 
Dashboard also includes a self -sufficiency target that identifies the estimated level at which after -tax 
income will position a worker to cover basic expenses  
• “CLIFF Planner” tool helps  individuals when they’re ready to map out details of a career move.  The tool 
helps  with more refined career and education planning and budgeting - customizable to individuals  & 
employers  
 
The Atlanta Fed’s “Policy Rules Database ” (PRD ) Dashboard  additionally  shows how the dollar value and 
composition of public assistance changes with increases in income. Users can select any public assistance 
program, location, and family type and visualize how benefits value changes with income.  
 
 
 Since initial development and customization  of the tools , there have been two rounds of pilots in partnership with 
several community -based organizations including MDOL programs and CareerCenters, Families Futures Downeast, 
Bangor Housing Authority , FedCAP, Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, the DHHS HOPE program, and 
McAuley Residence. Utilizing the learnings from both pilots, t he Departments are now in the process of 
developing  the tool “roll -out” plan , to be implemented this year .  The plan will address how the Departments and 
partners will:  
• Introduce the suite of tools to a range of case managers and coaches throughout the workforce and 
benefits administration systems  
• Establish a community of practice though which staff can share best practice s, ask questions, and learn 
from each other on coaching strategies related to benefits, cliffs, and careers  
• Identify and use metrics to evaluate impact of usage of the tools  
 
MDOLs recommendation would be to consider coordination with efforts the Department is currently engaged in 
with the Atlanta Fed CLIFF suite of tools .  I will be happy to  meet with the Sponsor to discuss the tool s and pilot 
results in more detail, and to  join you for the work session on this bill for further discussion  or to answer any 
questions you may have.
 
 
Sincerely,
