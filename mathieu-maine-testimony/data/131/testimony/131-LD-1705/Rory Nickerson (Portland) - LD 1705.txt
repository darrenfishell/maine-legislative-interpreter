LD 1705
Dear Judiciary Committee Members,
I write to ask for your support of LD 1705. Face recognition and other forms of 
biometric surveillance threaten our civil liberties. These technologies 
disproportionately harm over-surveilled communities and exacerbate existing racial 
and social inequity. 
Throughout our history, powerful surveillance tools have threatened institutional and 
individual abuse and discriminatory targeting disproportionately impacting the civil 
liberties and human rights of people of color, religious minorities, LGBTQ+ people, 
and political protesters.
Please support LD 1705 to protect our sensitive data and prevent harmful 
surveillance. This law will be good for Maine. We need companies to respect our 
privacy. Mainers deserve better.
Thank you for your consideration.
