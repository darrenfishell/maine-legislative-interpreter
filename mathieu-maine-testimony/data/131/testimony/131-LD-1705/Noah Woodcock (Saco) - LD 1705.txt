Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
my
name
is
Noah
W oodcock
and
I
am
currently
a
senio
at
Thornton
Academy
in
Saco
and
I
am
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1705,
An
Act
to
Give
Consumers
Control
over
Sensitive
Personal
Data
by
Requiring
Consumer
Consent
Prior
to
Collection
of
Data.
I
have
grown
up
in
a
society
in
which
social
media
has
had
an
overwhelming
presence.
From
instagram
to
snapchat,
we
are
constantly
bombarded
with
content,
advertisements,
and
influencers.
Social
media
companies
have
pursued
invasive
strategies
by
collecting
data
on
us,
creating
dangerously
addictive
algorithms,
and
influencing
us
with
precisely
tar geted
advertisements.
These
algorithms,
which
in
ef fect
alter
what
we
see
and
to
what
extent,
extremely
impair
our
freedom
of
choice.
Freedom
of
choice
requires
all
options
and
subsequent
information
to
be
available:
we
must
have
a
choice
about
whether
companies
can
collect
our
data
and
about
what
they
do
with
it.
Despite
the
conditions
for
such
freedom,
companies
use
our
data
to
manipulate
our
choices,
habits,
behaviors,
etc.
This
poses
a
direct
threat
to
our
youth,
and
as
I
have
talked
to
dozens
of
youth
about
this
issue,
they
agree
with
those
sentiments
too.
It
is
imperative
to
start
regulating
the
usage
and
type
of
data
that
is
being
collected,
one
of
them
being
biometric
data.
Biometrics
are
by
far
one
of
the
most
invasive
and
dangerous
pieces
of
data
that
companies
can
collect
from
us.
Unlike
financial
information
or
one’ s
interests,
biometrics
are
something
one
can

not
change.
I
think
an
application
of
biometric
identifiers
that
concern
the
youth
of
our
state
the
most
is
employee
tracking.
Companies
are
increasing
the
use
of
biometric
identifiers
to
not
only
track
when
workers
clock
in
or
out,
but
closely
monitor
our
activity .
This
is
gravely
concerning
for
two
reasons:
first,
using
our
physical
features
is
a
deep
invasion
of
privacy .
Biometrics
may
include
the
use
of
our
fingerprints,
irises,
voices,
human
faces,
etc.
Sensitive
data
like
this
has
great
potential
to
be
misused
by
companies.
It
can
be
sold
to
other
companies,
who
will
then
use
it
to
manipulate
consumers’
choices.
Biometric
data
is
also
at
risk
of
being
hacked
by
other
entities,
which
means
that
sensitive
data
that
we
can
not
change
will
forever
be
exposed.
Overall,
the
future
generation
is
facing
a
precarious
and
dangerous
workplace
with
the
increasing
use
of
biometrics.
However ,
we
have
an
opportunity
to
address
this
issue
at
hand.
I
would
like
the
committee
to
view
our
concerns
of
privacy
invasion,
exploitation
of
data
and
companies’
potential
use
of
our
sensitive
data
as
opposition
to
LD
1973.
In
closing,
young
people
in
Maine
are
not
able
to
vote
on
these
issues.
W e
count
on
adults
and
you,
the
legislature,
to
protect
us
now
and
to
protect
our
future.
By
passing
LD
1705,
the
state
is
doing
as
such.
Therefore,
I
ur ge
the
committee
for
a
motion
of
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1705.
Thank
you
for
your
time,
and
I
am
happy
to
take
any
questions.
