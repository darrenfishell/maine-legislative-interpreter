Re:
LD
1705,
An
Act
T o
Regulate
the
Use
of
Biometric
Identifiers
—
SUPPOR T
Dear
Chair
Carney
and
Chair
Moonen,
Consumer
Reports
1
writes
in
support
of
LD
1705,
an
act
to
protect
the
privacy
of
biometric
information.
Though
the
collection
and
monetization
of
Maine
consumers’
personal
data
has
dramatically
expanded
over
the
last
thirty
years,
consumers
have
almost
no
say
over
whether
their
biometric
information
will
be
shared
by
a
company
with
countless
others.
This
important
proposal
will
protect
biometric
information
by
default,
ensure
that
consumers
cannot
be
char ged
for
protecting
their
data,
and
provides
appropriate
incentives
for
companies
to
comply .
Biometric
data
clearly
warrants
these
additional
protections.
Collection
and
retention
of
such
data
leaves
it
vulnerable
to
unwanted
disclosure,
either
intentional
or
otherwise.
Biometric
data
is
commonly
used
to
confirm
consumers’
identity
and
can
easily
be
exploited
for
identity
theft
and
fraud
purposes.
Unlike
a
credit
card
number ,
the
consumer ’ s
biometric
information
cannot
be
changed,
making
its
unwanted
disclosure
all
the
more
dangerous.
2
But
concerns
about
inappropriate
disclosure
go
far
beyond
its
potential
misuse
for
the
purposes
of
fraud.
Aside
from
the
inherent
privacy
interest
in
keeping
this
information
private,
the
disclosure
of
biometric

data—for
example,
of
voice
recordings—could
lead
to
reputational
or
emotional
harm.
Particularly
in
light
of
the
plethora
of
data
breaches
in
recent
years,
biometric
data
should
have
these
additional
protections.
3
W e
appreciate
that
the
bill
includes
the
following
key
protections:
●
Restrictions
on
collection
without
consent
and
a
ban
on
sales.
Measures
lar gely
based
on
an
opt-out
model
could
require
consumers
to
contact
many
dif ferent
companies
in
order
to
fully
protect
their
privacy—which
simply
isn’ t
workable.
Making
matters
worse,
Consumer
Reports
has
documented
that
some
opt-out
processes
are
so
onerous
that
they
have
the
ef fect
of
preventing
consumers
from
stopping
the
sale
of
their
information.
4
In
contrast,
LD
1705
would
require
that
companies
obtain
consumers’
written
permission
before
collecting,
using,
or
sharing
their
biometric
data,
and
prohibits
the
onward
sale
of
that
data
outright.
●
Non-discrimination.
W e
appreciate
that
the
bill
includes
strong
non-discrimination
language
that
clarifies
that
consumers
cannot
be
char ged
for
exercising
their
rights
under
the
law .
Such
protections
are
important:
otherwise,
privacy
rights
are
only
extended
to
those
who
can
af ford
to
pay
for
them.
●
Str ong
enfor cement
.
Importantly ,
the
bill
includes
a
private
right
of
action
to
better
ensure
compliance.
Under
an
AG-only
enforcement
framework,
businesses
that
recognize
that
the
AG
is
only
capable
of
bringing
a
handful
of
enforcement
actions
each
year
might
simply
ignore
the
law
and
take
their
chances
in
evading
detection.
Further ,
it’ s
appropriate
that
consumers
are
able
to
hold
companies
accountable
in
some
way
for
violating
their
rights.
For
these
reasons,
we
ur ge
you
to
secure
key
privacy
protections
for
Maine
consumers
by
voting
in
favor
of
LD
1705.
Sincerely ,
Matt
Schwartz
Policy
Analyst
