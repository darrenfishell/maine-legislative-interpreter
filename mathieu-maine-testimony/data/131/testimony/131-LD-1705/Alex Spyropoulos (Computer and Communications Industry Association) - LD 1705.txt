Dear
Co-Chair
Carney,
Co-Chair
Moonen,
and
Members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary:
On
behalf
of
the
Computer
&
Communications
Industry
Association
(CCIA),
I
write
to
respectfully
oppose
LD
1705,
An
Act
to
Give
Consumers
Control
over
Sensitive
Personal
Data
by
Requiring
Consumer
Consent
Prior
to
Collection
of
Data.
CCIA
is
an
international,
not-for-proﬁt
trade
association
representing
a
broad
cross-section
of
communications
and
technology
ﬁrms.
1
CCIA
supports
the
enactment
of
comprehensive
federal
privacy
legislation
to
promote
a
trustworthy
information
ecosystem
characterized
by
clear
and
consistent
consumer
privacy
rights
and
responsibilities
for
organizations
that
collect
and
process
data.
A
uniform
federal
approach
to
the
protection
of
consumer
privacy
throughout
the
economy
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
businesses
have
regulatory
certainty
in
meeting
their
compliance
obligations
and
that
consumers
are
able
to
exercise
their
rights.
CCIA
appreciates,
however,
that
in
the
absence
of
baseline
federal
privacy
protections,
state
lawmakers
are
attempting
to
ﬁll
in
the
gaps.
To
inform
these
efforts,
CCIA
produced
a
set
of
principles
to
promote
fair
and
accountable
data
practices.
2
CCIA
strongly
supports
the
protection
of
consumer
data
and
understands
that
Maine
residents
are
rightfully
concerned
about
the
proper
safeguarding
of
their
data,
particularly
when
it
comes
to
their
biometric
information.
However,
we
believe
that
efforts
to
protect
biometric
data
would
be
better
suited
being
incorporated
into
a
comprehensive
data
privacy
bill,
similar
to
S.P.
807
which
was
recently
introduced
and
does
include
biometric
data
under
its
deﬁnition
of
“sensitive
data”.
CCIA
welcomes
the
opportunity
to
work

@ C C I A n e t
with
the
Legislature
on
comprehensive
data
privacy
legislation,
and
in
the
interim
offers
the
following
comments
on
LD
1705,
several
areas
of
which
are
of
concern.
1 .

w i t h
t h e

b e n e ﬁ c i a l
t o
c o n s u m e r s
a n d
b u s i n e s s e s
a l i k e .
LD
1705
permits
consumers
to
bring
legal
action
against
companies
that
have
been
accused
of
violating
new
regulations.
By
creating
a
new
private
right
of
action,
the
measure
would
open
the
doors
of
Maine’s
courthouses
to
plaintiffs
advancing
frivolous
claims
with
little
evidence
of
actual
injury.
Lawsuits
also
prove
extremely
costly
and
time-intensive
–
it
is
foreseeable
that
these
costs
would
be
passed
on
to
individual
consumers
in
Maine,
disproportionately
impacting
smaller
businesses
and
startups
across
the
state.
Additionally,
studies
have
shown
that
law
ﬁrms
are
the
primary
ﬁnancial
beneﬁciaries
from
biometric
privacy-related
lawsuits,
as
in
the
eight
case
settlements
involving
alleged
harm
to
consumers
in
Illinois,
plaintiffs’
lawyers
received
an
average
settlement
of
$11.5
million
per
ﬁrm
per
case,
while
individuals
received
an
average
settlement
of
$506
per
case
3
.
Furthermore,
investing
sole
enforcement
authority
with
the
state
attorney
general
allows
for
the
leveraging
of
technical
expertise
concerning
enforcement
authority,
placing
public
interest
at
the
forefront.
CCIA
recommends
that
the
legislation
be
amended
to
include
a
cure
period
of
at
least
30
days.
This
would
allow
for
actors
operating
in
good
faith
to
correct
an
unknowing
or
technical
violation,
reserving
formal
lawsuits
and
violation
penalties
for
the
bad
actors
that
the
bill
intends
to
address.
This
would
also
focus
the
government’s
limited
resources
on
enforcing
the
law’s
provisions
for
those
that
persist
in
violations
despite
being
made
aware
of
such
alleged
violations.
Such
notice
allows
consumers
to
receive
injunctive
relief,
but
without
the
time
and
expense
of
bringing
a
formal
suit.
Businesses
would
also
be
better
equipped
with
the
time
and
resources
to
address
potential
privacy
changes
rather
than
shifting
focus
to
defending
against
litigation.

Several
deﬁnitions
included
in
LD
1705
should
be
amended
in
order
to
align
with
privacy
laws
that
are
already
in
place
throughout
the
country.
First,
the
deﬁnition
of
“biometric
identiﬁer”
should
be
amended
to
include
language
that
addresses
data
generated
by
the
automated
measurements
of
a
consumers’
biological
characteristics,
in
order
to
align
better
with
language
from
Virginia,
Colorado,
and
Washington’s
laws.
Additionally,
the
“biometric
identiﬁer”
deﬁnition
should
fully
exempt
photos

and
videos,
as
to
match
the
language
included
in
the
laws
in
the
three
aforementioned
states.
Proposed
amended
language
is
included
below:
“Biometric
identiﬁer.
"Biometric
identiﬁer"
means
information
generated
by
automatic
measurements
of
an
individual's
unique
biological
characteristics,
including
a
voiceprint
or
imagery
of
the
iris,
retina,
ﬁngerprint,
face
or
hand,
that
can
be
used
to
identify
that
individual.
"Biometric
identiﬁer"
does
not
include:
A.
A
writing
sample
or
written
signature;
B.
A
photograph
or
video,
except
for
measurable
biological
characteristics
that
can
be
generated
or
captured
from
a
photograph
or
video;
C.
A
biological
sample
used
for
valid
scientiﬁc
testing
or
screening;
D.
Demographic
information;
E.
A
tattoo
description
or
a

description,
such
as

or

A

or
other
body
part,
blood
or
serum
stored
on
behalf
of
a
recipient
or
potential

of
a
living

designated

medical
condition
or
to
further
validate
scientiﬁc
testing
or
screening;
or
I.
Information
collected,
used
or
disclosed
for
human
subject
research”
Additionally,
we
suggest
that
the
deﬁnition
of
“personal
information”
be
amended
to
exempt
publicly-available
information
and
de-identiﬁed
data.
Both
of
these
types
of
data
are
different
from
the
rest
of
the
information
this
bill
seeks
to
protect,
and
Colorado
and
Virginia
include
similar
exemptions
in
their
laws.
Proposed
amended
language
is
included
below:
“Personal
information.
"Personal
information"
means
information
that
identiﬁes,
relates
to,
describes,
is
reasonably
capable
of
being
associated
with
or
could
reasonably
be
linked,
directly
or
indirectly,
with
a
particular
individual,
household
or
electronic
device.
It
does
not
include
publicly-available
information
or
de-identiﬁed
data.
”
Finally,
we
suggest
that
the
consent
requirement
not
be
limited
only
to
written
consent
given
the
nature
of
biometric
uses
and
contexts.
In
place
of
the
current
language,
we
suggest
that
the
following
be
included:
