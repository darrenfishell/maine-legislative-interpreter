Judicial Branch testimony in favor of LD 137, An Act to Amend the Maine 
Parentage Act Regarding Joinder of Parties:
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony in support of this bill.
The changes to the Maine Parentage Act set forth in LD 137 were proposed by the 
Family Law Advisory Commission (FLAC), a group of experts and practitioners of family law 
that includes members of the Judicial Branch.
The pending legislation revises current law in two ways. First, it states that a child is not 
required to be joined as a party in a proceeding to determine that child’s parentage. And second, 
it clarifies that a final order of a court that indicates that the parties are the parents of the child 
serves as an adjudication of that child’s parentage which is binding on the parties to the 
proceeding. It also clarifies that 19-A MRS § 1844 applies to proceedings to annul a marriage or 
for legal separation, as well as to divorce proceedings; and expands the scope of the law to apply 
to proceedings to determine the parental rights and responsibilities with respect to a child’s 
unmarried parents.
The Judicial Branch supports these changes. Thank you.
