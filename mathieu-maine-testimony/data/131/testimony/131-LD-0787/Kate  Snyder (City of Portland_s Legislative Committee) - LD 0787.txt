Testimony in support of LD 787 (
An Act to Create the
New Maine Resident Service
Coordination Program in the Department of Economic and Community Development
)
Senator Curry , Representative Roberts, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on
Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business:
I write to you on behalf of the City of Portland’ s Legislative/Nominating Committee in support
of LD 787, An Act to Create the New Maine Resident Service Coordination Program in the
Department of Economic and Community Development.
Over the last few years, an overwhelming number of asylum seekers have sought services and
shelter in Portland and other municipalities across Maine. Despite reaching shelter capacity and
communicating this status publicly , the number of individuals relocating to Maine has
remained steady .
Municipalities cannot face this challenge alone. The State of Maine must be the central
coordinator for newly arriving asylum seekers and the State must work across government
agencies and municipalities to respond to the situation at hand.
There is an on-going, ur gent need for statewide coordination of services for the hundreds of
asylum seeker families arriving in our Maine communities. The City of Portland’ s Legislative
Committee asks that you support LD 787 to ensure that municipalities are not solely relied
upon as the de facto solution to a Statewide challenge.
Thank you for your consideration.
