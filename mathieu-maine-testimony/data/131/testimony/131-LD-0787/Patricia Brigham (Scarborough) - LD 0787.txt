I would like to urge the IDEA Committee to act favorably on this proposed bill as it offers a 
solution to several challenges currently facing the state: labor shortages and  the social 
service demands- housing,  financial,etc. involved in supporting New Mainers. Streamlining 
the process for allowing New Mainers, many of whom are willing and able to work, and in 
some cases, highly educated, to enter the work force, legally, would yield positive economic 
and human service results.
Respectfully submitted,
