Box 17642 Portland, ME 04112-8642 (207) 523-9869      mainemacdl@gmail.com  April 19, 2023   Senator Ben Chipman, Chair Representative Lynne Williams, Chair Committee on Transportation 100 State House Station, Room 126 Augusta, ME 04333   RE: LD 819: An Act to Reduce the Penalty for Operating a Motor Vehicle Under a Suspended License in Certain Situations   Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation:   MACDL supports LD 819. While this bill appears to make only a small change how we deal with minor vehicle offenses, the outsized effect this change will have in the lives of some Mainers is hard to overstate. This bill reduces one very minor motor vehicles offense from a crime to a traffic infraction. In so doing, however, it prevents people from ever entering the criminal justice system. Considering the massive court backlog of criminal cases, a shift of these matters to a more streamlined process that takes a fraction of the court time, can alleviate some of the stress to an over-burdened system.  Individuals convicted of operating after suspension forever must report having a criminal record. Their conviction has the collateral consequence of having their license suspended for additional time by the Secretary of State – something they may not know about at the time of their conviction. In this rural state with very little public transportation, losing one’s license can lead to a loss of a job, or hamper the ability to care for family members. It forces people to make an impossible choice whether to drive without a license. Getting caught doing so leads to even great consequences of new charges and longer license suspensions. It is a cycle some cannot escape.    This small step will provide relief for a population often living on margins of subsistence, while not putting the public at any greater safety risk. We hope the Committee will support this important change. Thank you for the opportunity to address this issue.                      Sincerely,                                 James Mason, Esq.                             MACDL Board Member   2022-2023 OFFICERS  President Amber L.
