LD 819 - An Act to Reduce the Penalty for Operating a Motor Vehicle Under 
a Suspended License in Certain Situations 
 
 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and esteemed members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation, my name is Jason Trundy and I’m the 
Sheriff of Waldo County and I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 819.  
 
Creating efficiencies in the criminal justice system is a worthy objective and 
something I strive to support. Reclassifying minor offenses that will not result in jail 
sentences will alleviate some of the burden of our overloaded judicial system in 
Maine by redirecting these infractions out of our district courts and to Violations 
Bureau and traffic court. It's important to note that this bill still holds offenders 
accountable for their infractions, but it removes the classification as criminals which 
can have serious, long-term consequences. 
 
The bipartisan sponsorship of this bill is an excellent illustration of Maine lawmakers 
collaborating to help address the chronic, overwhelming caseloads that are clogging 
up our courts state-wide. Over the long term, this will also reduce the incarceration of 
some individuals who could be held pending an arraignment date for a minor criminal 
offense. While those numbers are few, it would help our jails, nonetheless. I 
commend this approach and those who worked together to bring this bill forward. 
 
I appreciate the opportunity to offer my support for LD 819. 
 
 
 
Sincerely yours,
