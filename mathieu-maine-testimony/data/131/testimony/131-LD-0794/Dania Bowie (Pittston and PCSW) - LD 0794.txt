Dear
Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover ,
and
the
members
of
the
State
and
Local
Af fairs
Committee,
My
name
is
Dania
Bowie,
I
am
27
years
old,
and
I
am
writing
in
support
of
LD
794
.
I
am
a
member
of
the
Permanent
Commission
on
the
Status
of
W omen.
I
work
for
the
Maine
W omen’ s
Lobby
and
live
in
Pittston
with
my
partner .
I
sit
on
the
board
of
Maine
Inside
Out
and
the
Southern
Maine
W orkers
Center ,
as
well
as
on
the
committee
for
the
Black,
Indigenous,
and
People
of
Color
Fund
at
the
Maine
Community
Foundation.
I
am
asking
you
to
support
this
bill
because
it
is
the
first
step
toward
building
Maine’ s
systems,
which
are
central
to
informing
policies
that
work
for
everyday
folks,
particularly
women,
girls,
and
gender -diverse
folks.
The
Commission
needs
funding
and
an
incr ease
in
capacity ,
not
only
to
better
r epr esent
the
variety
of
experiences
of
Maine
women,
but
to
deliver
r elevant
information
that
is
useful,
accurate,
and
timely
for
the
Legislatur e.
This
investment
goes
well
into
the
future
to
set
up
the
systems
required
for
policymaking
work
that
brings
us
a
step
toward
a
gender -just
future.
I
am
so
thankful
to
Senator
V itelli
for
sponsoring
this
important
bill
because
it
showed
me
that
our
lawmakers
care
about
the
health
and
well-being
of
our
systems.
W e
all
have
lived
the
consequences
of
an
inherited
system
not
designed
for
women
and
children.
Before
the
pandemic,
we
already
knew
our
systems
were
very
broken:
In
the
1990s
in
Kennebec
County ,
my
mother -in-law
left
her
full-time
employment
to
take
care
of
three
kids
because
it
made
more
sense
to
stay
at
home
than
pay
for
childcare.
Every
day
in
my
early
childhood,
my
own
mother ,
who
immigrated
with
my
father
from
the
Philippines
in
the
1980s,
dropped
my
siblings
and
me
of f
at
our
cousins’
house
after
school
on
her
way
to
the
hospital
to
work
the
night
shift.
After
dinner ,
our
dad
picked
us
up
from
his
day
shift
and
brought
us
home.
I
spent
most
of
my
childhood
not
seeing
my
parents
in
the
same
room
often
or
even
having
a
sit-down
dinner
with
them
unless
it
was
a
special
occasion.
W e
missed
important
years.
My
mother -in-law ,
in
her
situation,
lost
years
of
income
and
retirement
savings.
T oday ,
we
know
the
crisis
for
care
is
worse
and
it
doesn’ t
just
af fect
parents
and
children
-
it's
af fecting
our
economy ,
our
health,
and
our
overall
quality
of
life
in
Maine.
This
is
just
one
of
many
ur gent
gender
issues
our
lawmakers
are
being
called
to
work
on
for
the
people
of
Maine
and
the
Commission
was
set
up
to
help.
The
Commission
needs
support
to
do
its
job.
T o
identify
the
disparities
and
find
the
solutions
to
what
we
know
-
to
what
we
are
living
-
we
must
better
support
this
Commission
by
passing
LD
794
and
increasing
the
Commission’ s
capacity .
Just
a
couple
of
statistics
show
the
tip
of
the
iceber g
and
snapshots
of
our
current
moment
in
time
for
women
and
children
in
Maine:
●
Since
the
start
of
the
pandemic
in
2020,
over
5
million
women
and
mothers
have
had
to
leave
the
workfor ce,
devastating
our
economy
and
families.
Before
the
pandemic,
mothers
were
40
percent
more
likely
than
fathers
to
report
that
they
had
personally
felt
the
negative
impact
of
childcar e
issues
on
their
car eers.
1
The
economic
security
for
women
is
af fected
by
inequity
in
our
systems
due
to
pay
disparities,
discrimination,
and
a
lack
of
statewide
programs
such
as
Paid
Family
and
Medical
Leave.
●
Almost
70%
of
Maine
childr en
under
the
age
of
6
live
in
households
wher e
all
par ents
work
.
2
This
means
that
parents
miss
out
on
the
most
formative
years
of
their
child's
development,
but
also
that
the
schedule
of
work
for
parents
creates
a
gap
in
caretaking
time
and
quality .
This
leads
to
poor
health
outcomes
for
children
and
families.
●
The
average
cost
of
daycar e
in
2021
for
Maine
families
ranged
from
close
to
$5,500
a
year
for
school-aged
children
to
over
$12,000
for
infants.
3
These
costs
are
a
serious
barrier
to
childcare
in
the
current
economy
for
parents,
even
if
all
the
parents
work
full-time
or
multiple
jobs.
What
does
this
mean?
It
means
that
parents,
particularly
women
who
are
still
most
often
the
primary
caretaker
of
the
household,
are
experiencing
adverse
economic
impacts
from
our
lack
of
systemic
change
since
I
was
a
kid.
It’ s
been
over
30
years
and
we’re
still
here
right
where
my
mother
and
my
partner ’ s
mother
were
with
childcare.
And
the
next
generation
of
Maine
childr en,
as
a
r esult,
ar e
alr eady
experiencing
the
cost
of
gender
inequity
today .
When
we
set
up
women
and
girls
to
thrive
on
a
systems
level,
especially
those
women
and
girls
from
diverse
backgrounds
across
race,
age,
class,
etc.
everyone
benefits.
Supporting
the
Commission
is
the
first
step.
Please
support
LD
794.
Thank
you.
