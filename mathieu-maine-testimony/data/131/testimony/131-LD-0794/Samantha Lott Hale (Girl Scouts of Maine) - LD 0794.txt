I am writing in support of LD794, An Act to Expand the Membership of the 
Permanent Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW). I have had the honor of 
serving as a member of the PCSW for nearly ten years representing the youth seat and
discussing issues impacting girls and women throughout our state with others who 
have brought different aspects and perspectives of womenâ€™s experience to the table. 
No one can represent all of the experiences and challenges lived by Maine women 
and girls but it is the diverse representation of commissioners that makes the 
discussions rich and the picture more complete. The addition of two seats to the 
commission is important as it will  bring the experience of Maine girls and women 
into even clearer focus by adding voices to the discussions, reports, and work of the 
PCSW. I feel especially strongly about adding a seat for a youth member.
As the VP of Program for Girl Scouts of Maine, I have seen firsthand the impact that 
youth voice has on our work. Two years ago, we started a Teen Advisory Group to 
help inform decisions across the council from program to marketing to our product 
program. This group of 8th-12th grade girls have asked and answered questions that 
have changed how we engage with older girls, what programs we offer, and more. 
They have grown as leaders themselves as they organized and presented statewide 
events and have given the perspectives that only they have as youth and 
representatives of youth culture in our society. Though in our organization, we are 
attuned to youth development and regularly interact with youth, the girls themselves 
make discussions more rich and decisions more informed.
Thank you for your consideration of this legislation. The expansion of the PCSW will 
help serve the state of Maine more effectively by adding voices to the table and by 
allowing the issues facing girls and women to be better communicated and 
understood.
