Testimonyi of Senator Henry Ingwersen in Support of 
LD 1609, An Act to Prevent Student Homelessness 
Before the Senate Committee on Housing 
Friday, April 21, 2023 
Good moming Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and distinguished members of the Joint Select 
Committee on Housing. My name is Henry Ingwersen and I represent the good people of Senate 
District 32, the towns of Arundel, Biddeford, Dayton, Hollis and Lyman. 
I am here today in support of LD 1609, “An Act to Prevent Student Homelessness, ” joining school 
administrators from my district and a community of current and former educators who sincerely care 
about the success of their students. It is very hard to watch Maine’s housing crisis impact vulnerable 
students. 
The best job I ever had was being a public school teacher for 25 years. Day in and day out, you form 
strong bonds with the students in your classrooms. You recognize when patterns change and kids are 
distressed. 
Our schools already have McKinny-Vento liaisons on the ground; they are already a key piece in the 
support network Maine offers families. They are trained. They want to help. Now we just need to 
ensure they have the resources to do so. 
I believe Maine schools can be part of the solution to preventing heartbreaking outcomes, and this fund 
is key if we’re serious about homelessness prevention. 
This session, we all recognize Maine needs to tackle immediate crises and strategize long-term ﬁxes. 
We know educators are seeing the crisis firsthand. I can think of no better way to make a meaningful 
impact on the amazing work they do every day. I urge you to support this bill. 
Thank you.
