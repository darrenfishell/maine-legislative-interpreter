Dear Sen. Pierce, Rep. Gere, and honorable members of the Housing Committee,
As an active volunteer in a non-profit that provides temporary shelter to families 
experiencing homelessness (Greater Portland Family Promise), I heartly support any 
funding measures that will work to prevent families becoming homeless in the first 
place. Shelters are a last-resort option that are more costly, more stressful for families,
and FAR more disruptive for kids. For the same reasons, I also support LD 1540.
Attaching funding to the existing McKinney-Vento program is an excellent idea -- it 
would efficiently and effectively use trusted school partners to target just-in-time 
funding where it is needed most. 
Sincerely,
Amy Johnson
