207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 1609 An Act to 
Prevent Student Homelessness 
April 21, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, members of the Committee on 
Housing, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the Maine 
Community Action Partnership, the membership organization 'of the ten 
community action agencies in Maine, and we support LD 1609 An Act to 
Prevent Student Homelessness. 
I want to thank Senators Pierce and Rafferty for their amendment, which 
while not in legal language, outlines the intention behind the bill is to 
work through existing channels and to fund them to support students. 
In my Community Action Agencies, we do work with the McKinney-Vento 
program more than occasionally, because as you see from the data 
provided by the program, the problem is real. It is also too often hidden 
from view - parents do not want their children's teachers to know, or 
even suspect, that they are homeless, or on the brink of being homeless. 
That is, of course, the unfortunate thing; early intervention can often 
avert a crisis and homelessness. The programs and services we provide 
to support families, using a Whole Family, or Two Generation, approach, 
can do a lot to help families in need and in crisis, but we cannot do it all. 
We partner with and depend on other community resources to help each 
family‘s well-being and to meet their potential. 
For children, homelessness, missing school for any reason, feeling 
“othered” for their "wrong" shoes, is a form of trauma. It causes adverse 
childhood events (ACEs) and the results are clear later in life. Children 
with higher ACE scores, the number of events added up, are more likely 
to do less well in school, ﬁnd lower wage jobs, misuse substances and 
grow into poverty, which is what we all want to avoid. 
A little over one million dollars a year can go a long way to preventing 
that. Reducing our children's exposure to ACEs, helping families to 
weather the storms that come with life and to stay stably housed, isa 
proven upstream, poverty prevention measure. 
Please support LD 1609, direct funding to the experts we have in place, 
and help children and families to thrive. 
Thank you for your time and attention, I am happy to answer your 
questions if I can. 
Megan Hannan
