Members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing  
 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere , and distinguished members of the Housing Committee:  
 
L.D. 1609, An Act to Prevent Student Homelessness , proposes to fund preventative measures to 
protect Maine students against housing insecurity. This fund would be housed within the 
Department of Education and would be managed by the McKinney -Vento liaisons at the local 
school administrative unit ( SAU ) level. The Department of Education (DOE) applauds every 
effort to support Maine students.  
 
Student homelessness is increasing in Maine. In 2023, 2,186 students were identified as 
experiencing housing insecurity. This marks a noticeable increase from the previous five years 
which had an average of 1,384 students identified for housing insecurity.  Students who 
experience homelessness face numerous barriers to education, including high rates of chronic 
absence, mobility, academic challenges, and trauma.  
The federal McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act requir es every public school  
administrative unit to designate a liaison who is tasked with identifying and supporting students 
experiencing homelessness or who are in inadequate housing. These liaisons receive annual  and 
ongoing  professional development and are involved in regional c ross-system collaboration with 
homeless providers, town offices, and other community -based organizations. Liaisons are 
familiar with the unique needs in their commu nities and with the families they serve. The 
McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act provides  approximately $3 30,000  a year to  identify 
and serve the students experiencing  homeless ness in the State of Maine . However, t his federal 
funding must be used to help identify these students and provide educationally related  supports, 
such as outreach, case management, and transportation. It cannot be used for rental assistance , 
utilities, and other housing -related needs. As a result, many SAU s face challenges in meeting the 
emergency needs of families when they must work wit hin the processes of federal funds.   
The funding proposed in LD 1609 would allow for McKinney -Vento liaisons to quickly access 
the resources  to meet families’ emergency needs and prevent the further traumas of 
homelessness. Oftentimes,  the difference between a few hundred dollars - for things like a car 
repair, rent payment, or utilit y bill – can determine if a family will experience  homelessness or 
not. This funding would ensure schools can access resources to support the basic needs of their 
students, so that these children can have what we wish for all our children – a peace ful childhood

to focus on their school experiences, and no t worry about where to sleep that night, or if there 
will be heat, or if their parent will lose their job because the car broke down.   
Currently, l iaisons spend  hours trying to navigate  each crisis as it arises , and help families 
navigate a patchwork of different systems and agencies. Together with families, t hey are 
contacting social services agencies , homeless provider networks, and local philanthropic avenues 
to find some assistance to divert families from the deepening crises . If there w ere a simpler way 
for liaisons  to access  emergency  financial support, it would save them the time and compassion 
fatigue, and potential burn out.  
The preventative nature of this bill is essential. When one does lose housing, the intensity of case 
management drastically increases. For example, w hen students are temporarily staying out -of-
district due to homelessness,  the McKinney -Vento  Act requires the districts arrange for and pay 
for transportation costs for the child to remain in their school of origin, if it is determined to be in 
the child’s best interest. While this transportation is essential for school stability, it is costly and 
time consumi ng to arrange. Also, homelessness has a significant impact on a student’s 
graduation. These preventative efforts will help improve attendance and achievement, and save 
staff time, effort, and significant costs.  
Maine has recognized the capacity needs of li aisons, and the M aine DOE has dedicated 
American Rescue Plan Homeless Children and Youth (ARP -HCY) funding directly to SAU s. 
The Maine DOE has set up regional support for liaisons through McKinney -Vento Contacts 
through Community -Based Organization s, built regional communit ies of lia isons and  service 
providers,  and streamlined processes  to simplify the liaison’s workload . The ARP -HCY funding 
was more flexible than traditional McKinney -Vento funds and  allowed for additional uses like 
temporary emergency housing and prepaid store cards. The ARP -HCY  funding has been 
instrumental in increased identification and support to our most vulnerable students. But we all 
know this funding is coming to an end soon. LD 1609 is an opportunity for Mai ne to honor its 
commitment to ensuring all our children have what they need to be able to focus on school and 
get to graduation.  The development of a new fund that would address the supports for rental 
assistance, utilities, and other housing -related needs  could help our SAUs and struggling Maine 
families meet these emergency needs.    
For these reasons, the Department of Education is in support of LD 1609 , An Act to Prevent Student 
Homelessness . I am confident that we can provide support to Maine’s liaisons  to implement this 
new pilot, just as we have throughout the pandemic. I am happy to answer any questions  the 
Committee may have , and I will be available for work sessions on this bill.  
 
Sincerely,
