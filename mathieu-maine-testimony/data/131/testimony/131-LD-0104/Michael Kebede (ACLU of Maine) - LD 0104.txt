TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ.  
 
Ought Not to Pass  - LD 104 
 
An Act to Make It a Crime Not to Report a Death  
 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON  
CRIMINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY  
 
March 6, 202 3 
 
Senator Bebee -Center , Representative Salisbury , and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety,  greetings .  My name is Michael Kebede, 
and I am the Policy Counsel at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed to 
advancing and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. 
Constitutions. On behalf of our members, we urge you to oppose  LD 104.  
This bill (still a concept draft as of March 6th, 2023)  proposes to make it a crime not to 
report a death. If enacted, this bill would mark a major departure from the general criminal legal 
rule that in order to commit a crime, one must engage in affirmative behavior that endangers 
another. This bill would effectively turn silence into a crime . But new crimes do not stop abhorrent 
behavior or address its underlying root causes. This bill is no different. Creating a new crime will 
not help keep us safe. There are other, be tter ways to ensure that deaths are investigated.  
We urge you to vote ought not to pass.
