My name is David White and this is my wife Mary. Our daughter Hanah 
Grace White struggled with addiction for the better part of 5yrs 
beginning at age 17 until her death form an overdose. I received the call 
that Hanah Grace had been found dead in a known trap house and had 
been dead for days on Sept. 29 @ 2:29pm From the Caribou PD a date 
and time I will never forget! I later spoke with people that knew our 
daughter and were aware of the circumstances of Hanah's death and 
they told me and I quote ‚Äù it's a shame how they did Hanah" I asked 
what they meant and they told me that she had been dead for 3 days 
before anyone called it in. Our daughter did not deserve to lie on that 
cold floor dead for 3 days NO ONE DESERVES that. It is hard to 
understand how another human being could treat another this way. 
The owner of the house slept in his truck in his driveway during the 
time that Hanah was dead in his house. When I spoke with the PD 
about this and was informed that there was no law on the books 
pertaining to the reporting of a death, I made a promise to Hanah thatI 
would do everything in my power to change this. I contacted Rep. Babin 
and Sen. Stewart and they took the lead on drafting the proposed bill 
LD14O that you are considering today, it is my hope that LD14O will 
become law.
