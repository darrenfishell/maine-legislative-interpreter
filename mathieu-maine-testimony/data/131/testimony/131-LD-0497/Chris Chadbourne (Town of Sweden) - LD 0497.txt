RE: LD 497 An Act To Prohibit the Use of Personal Watercraft on Keyes Pond and 
Stearns Pond in the Town of Sweden 
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit information in support of LD 497 An Act To 
Prohibit the Use of Personal Watercraft on Keyes Pond and Stearns Pond in the Town 
of Sweden. 
As you are aware, this Committee addressed similar legislation in the 130"‘ Legislature, 
and ultimately the Legislature passed Resolves 2021, ch. 45, which directed the 
Department of IF &W to “monitor whether the Town of Sweden votes to support 
prohibiting personal watercraft on Keyes Pond.” 
We would now like to report that on March 26, 2022, the Town of Sweden held its annual 
town meeting. Article 33 on the Town Warrant read as follows: “To see if the Town will 
recommend that the Maine State Legislature prohibit the operation of personal 
watercraft on Keyes Pond in Sweden, Maine.” The citizens of the Town of Sweden voted 
unanimously in favor of this article. 
No vote has been held yet on whether there should be a similar prohibition on Stearns 
Pond. If such a vote is held, we will report that result immediately to this Committee. 
In the meantime, we urged you to move ahead with adopting that portion of LD 497 
that would prohibit the use of personal watercraft on Keyes Pond. 
Thank you for listening to the citizens of the Town of Sweden. 
Sincerely 
ect of the Town of Sweden, Maine 
Chris Chadbourne, Chairman 
Dan McQueen 
Kerry Welton
