Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Committee,
I am a resident of Sweden Maine and live full time on Stearns Pond. I do not think Stearns 
Pond should be included in this bill. The people backing this bill do not live on the pond and 
some aren't Sweden residents. There is one woman on Stearns Pond that has a PWC. Her 
boat didn't run so her children bought the jet ski for her to use. She enjoys it and uses it a 
couple times a week to cruise around the pond visiting people. It would be a shame to take 
this away from her.
The tax payers on Stearns Pond are pretty much self governed and do not need or want more
rules or laws.
Keyes Pond and Stearns Pond are very different and should not be together on the bill. The 
person that contacted Representative Millett and told him to add Stearns Pond to the bill had 
no authority to do that. I was a selectman in Sweden when the public hearing and town 
meeting were held for Keyes Pond and Stearns Pond was not a part of those.
Thank you,
Warren deWildt
