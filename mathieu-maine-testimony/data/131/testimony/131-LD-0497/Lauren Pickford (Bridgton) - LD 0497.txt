Dear Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, 
My name is Lauren Pickford and I am the Planning and Land Use Manager for the Lakes Environmental 
Association (LEA), which serves the Lake Region of Western Maine and all of Maineâ€™s lakes through 
the Maine Lake Science Center.   
LEA strongly supports LD 497: " An Act to Prohibit the Use of Personal Watercraft on Keyes 
Pond and Stearns Pond in the Town of Sweden" 
Many residents of the quiet rural town emphasized the need to preserve the peace and tranquility of the 
small ponds, which are cherished assets to the local community. Concerns have been raised about the 
potential noise pollution and safety hazards that personal watercraft could introduce, as well as the 
negative impact on the delicate ecosystem of the pond.  
In a bid to maintain the pond's traditional character and serenity, residents and summer vacationers, 
including the owner of Camp Tapawingo, have sought the passage of LD 349. Based on the 
overwhelming support for the prohibition of personal watercraft on Keyes Pond and Stearns Pond, it is 
clear that this is a measure that would be in the best interests of the community as a whole. This request 
is a testament to Maine's time-honored practice of home-rule, and I urge you to vote "ought to pass" in 
support of this worthy cause. 
Thank you,  
 
Lauren Pickford 
Planning and Land Use Manager
