TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF LD 497 
An Act to Prohibit the Use of Personal Watercraft on Keyes and Stearns Ponds in the 
Town of Sweden 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, I am Sawin Millett and I represent House District 81 which 
includes 7 communities in Southern and Western Oxford County. I am pleased to present LD 
497, An Act to Prohibit the Use of Personal Watercraft on Keyes and Stearns Ponds in the Town 
of Sweden. 
By way of background, I submitted a similar bill in 2021 involving Keyes Pond only. In drafting 
that bill, the Revisor followed the legislative process for adding water bodies to the list of bodies 
on which the operation of personal watercraft is prohibited that existed up until the early 2000’s. 
As you are in no doubt aware, that process was later changed to require a local public hearing 
and a subsequent vote of the governing body before advancing such legislation. After learning of 
this change, your committee agreed to carry my bill forward to allow for the local process to 
occur. In early 2022, the Town of Sweden held a public hearing on Keyes Pond and the Town 
later voted “unanimously ” to support this listing at its March 2022 Town Meeting. Thus, I am 
asking that you add Keyes Pond to the statutory list of bodies in your action on this bill. 
The same process was imitated locally for Stearns Pond with a public hearing called for February 
24, 2023 — the day on which a large snowstorm hit the area. A rescheduled hearing was held on 
March llth with about 50 people in attendance. I am told that there was not a clear consensus on 
whether to include Stearns Pond to the list. This question was already included on the Warrant 
for the March 25m Town Meeting. I have infonned the townspeople that I will ask your 
Committee to remove Stearns Pond from this Bill if the Saturday Town Meeting vote is not 
clearly supportive of its inclusion. 
Thank you, and I will be pleased to respond to your questions. 
Maine House District 81
