Senator, District 18 ‘ Augusta, Maine 04333 
THE MAINE SENATE 
13 lst Legislature 
Testimony of Senator Richard A. Bennett 
In Support of LD 497, "An Act to Prohibit the Use of Personal Watercraft on Keyes Pond and 
Stearns Pond in the Town of Sweden" 
22 March 2023 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and esteemed members of the Inland Fisheries and 
Wildlife Committee, I am Senator Rick Bennett, and I have the honor of serving 14 communities 
in Western Maine in the State Senate. Thank you for allowing me to voice my support for L.D. 
497, "An Act to Prohibit the Use of Personal Watercraft on Keyes Pond and Stearns Pond in the 
Town of Sweden” of which I am a co-sponsor. 
During the 130"‘ Legislature, Rep. Sawin Millett sponsored LD 349, “An Act to Prohibit the Use 
of Personal Watercraft on Keyes Pond in the Town of Sweden.” This bill was turned intoa 
study requiring the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to monitor whether the Town of 
Sweden voted to support prohibiting personal watercraft (PWC) on Keyes Pond. Now that 
Sweden has voted in favor of restricting use of PWC, Rep. Millett has sponsored LD 497. 
LD 497 also addresses Stearns Pond. Sweden is considering a PWC ban on Stearns this 
Saturday at a town meeting. I support whatever decision the Town ultimately decides on. 
Thank you for your time.
