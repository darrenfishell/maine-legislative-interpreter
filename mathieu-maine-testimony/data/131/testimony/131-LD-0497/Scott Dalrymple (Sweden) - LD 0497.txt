RE: LD 497 An Act to Prohibit the Use of Personal Watercraft on Keyes Pond and Stearns 
Pond in the Town of Sweden
 
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and Members of the Committee:
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 497 An Act to Prohibit the Use 
of Personal Watercraft on Keyes Pond and Stearns Pond in the Town of Sweden.
I am a Sweden resident and an avid fisherman. I fish regularly on Keyes Pond and believe the use of 
personal watercraft would be incompatible with the traditional uses of Keyes Pond. 
Keyes Pond is an excellent candidate for the no-personal-watercraft list. It is only 192 acres and 
very shallow in much of that area. It is popular for fishermen, kayakers, paddle boarders, and 
distance swimmers. 
The unique environment of Keyes is home to wildlife worth preserving. It is a place where loons 
have nested and raised their chicks every year for as long as residents on the pond since the 1970s 
can remember. Eagles and osprey regularly fish its waters, and beavers, otters, and moose all call it 
home. The Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife stocks the pond each fall with brook trout 
to augment the thriving cold-water fishery. Human residents spend evenings on their docks 
enjoying the quiet, interrupted only by the cries of loons.
At the 2022 Annual Town Meeting, I, along with all the other citizens of Sweden, voted to 
recommend that the Maine Legislature prohibit personal watercraft on Keyes Pond. The 
unanimous support reflects the clear will of the residents of Sweden.
I ask you to support the legislation to add Keyes Pond to the no-personal-watercraft list.
Sincerely,
Scott Dalrymple
