LD 981
Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen, 
My name is Tonya Dickey and I would like to thank you for this opportunity to speak to you 
today about the benefits around a new bill labeled LD – 981. I am hoping you will support this 
as it means very much to me. My addiction due to medical issues since he was a freshman in
high school, which required the doctors to prescribe pain medication. Fast forward through 
our ups and downs he had been clean going on. My name is Tonya Dickey and I would like to
thank you for this opportunity to speak to you today about the benefits around a new bill 
labeled LD – 981. I am hoping you will support this as it means very much to me. My son, 
Tyson, struggled with addiction due to medical issues since he was a freshman in high 
school, which required the doctors to prescribe pain medication. Fast forward through our ups
and downs he had been clean going on three years, when he needed surgery. The doctors 
prescribed pain medication, and the day after his prescription ran out he bought some thing 
that ended up being fentanyl. I believe had this bill been in place prior to Tysons relapse, he 
would still be here. In the last several years we have seen a dramatic increase in overdoses. 
It is a major health threat leaving children without parents, and mothers and fathers without 
their children. Most professional first responders carry Narcan but not all. That is where this 
bill comes into play. All first responders should be required to carry, use and be trained how 
to properly administer Narcan. Not only statewide but hopefully nationwide. If this bill passes, 
I request it be named in honor of my son, and called Tyson‘s Law.
Thank you for your time and all the hard work you do.
