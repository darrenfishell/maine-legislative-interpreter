SAFETY 
Public Hearing: Monday, March 27, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety: 
My name is Sam Hurley, and I am the Director of Maine Emergency Medical Services, Maine 
EMS, within the Department of Public Safety. I am testifying on behalf of Maine Department of 
Public Safety and Maine EMS neither for nor against LD 981, “An Act to Require All Emergency 
Medicai Services Persons to Be Trained in the Dispensing of Naloxone Hydrochloride." 
Maine EMS appreciates the intent of this legislation to ensure that all EMS clinicians throughout 
the state are trained in the dispensation of naloxone following an opioid overdose. In May 2021, 
the 130"‘ Legislature amended Maine’s statutes to permit EMS clinicians to dispense naloxone. 
EMS clinicians have always been allowed to administer naloxone under protocols and direction; 
however, this modiﬁcation allowed them to dispense the naloxone to individuals to be used ata 
time in the future. In the Fall of 2021, Maine EMS initiated its Naloxone Leave-Behind Program 
where individual services could voluntarily enroll in a program that supplied them with grant-

funded naloxone for them to dispense to the patient, their family, or bystanders on scene 
following the reversal of an opioid overdose. We sought voluntary participation to better 
understand any shortcomings in the programming and understand the implications of the leave- 
behind program. 
As a result of this programming, the Maine EMS Medical Direction and Practices Board recently 
approved changes to the Maine EMS state-wide EMS protocols that will require EMS clinicians 
throughout the state to offer leave-behind naloxone after every opioid overdose that refuses to be 
transported to the hospital. This change will be effective December 1, 2023. 
Again, we are supportive of the intent behind this legislation; however, the Medical Direction 
and Practices Board has already taken action that will implement the intent of this legislation. As 
a healthcare professional myself, I ’m always cautious of situations where legislative action 
prescribes clinical practice. We are appreciative of the support and motive behind this 
legislation; however, we do not feel that it is needed at this time. 
I am more than happy to answer any questions that you may have, but please feel free to reach 
out to me anytime if there is any additional information that we can offer you and/or the 
Committee. 
Thank you.
