TESTIMONY OF ANNE L. HEAD, COMMISSIONER 
DEPARTMENT OF PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL REGULATION 
IN OPPOSITION TO LD 207 and IN SUPPORT OF LD 207 AS AMENDED 
“AN ACT TO TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTERING THE MAINE UNIFORM 
BUILDING AND ENERGY CODE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, OFFICE 
OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PROFESSIONAL AND 
FINANCIAL REGULATION" 
Sponsored by Representative Joshua Morris 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND 
PUBLIC SAFETY 
Public Hearing: March 20, 2023, 1:00 PM 
Senator Beebe, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, my name is Anne Head. I am the Commissioner of the 
Department of Professional and Financial Regulation and the Director of the Ofﬁce of Professional 
and Occupational Regulation (OPOR). I intended to testify today in opposition to LD 207, as 
printed. I now understand, however, that Representative Morris has proposed an amendment that 
replaces the original bill. My printed testimony, therefore, combines reasons for DPFR’s 
opposition to the original bill and rationale for our support for the amended version. 
The original bill would move responsibility for the adoption and administration of the Maine 
Uniform Building and Energy Code (MUBEC) from the Department of Public Safety, Ofﬁce of 
the State Fire Marshal to the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation. It would 
establish the Division of Building Code Standards within the Department. 
At its inception many years ago, the code enforcement training program was located within the 
now-disbanded State Planning Office. Code enforcement training was then moved into DECD 
and later into the DPS State Fire Marshal’s office. Once located with the SFMO, MUBEC and 
the Technical Standards Board Were added to DPS. Code Enforcement Training and MUBEC 
are challenging programs to implement because of complex requirements, deﬁnitions,

exemptions, and certiﬁcation requirements that span several different titles of Maine statutes, 
departments and agencies. These include, but are not limited to, Titles: 5, 10, 25, 30-A, and 
35-A, and DPS, DECD, DHHS, DAFS, DOL and MSHA. 
One particularly signiﬁcant challenge in administering MUBEC is the wide range of entities 
responsible for delivering different aspects of necessary training. There is simply no single 
controlling agency, which is likely why it has been relocated from department to department. 
Moving this program to PFR will not resolve existing issues with MUBEC administration. It 
will only continue to contribute to the confusion, resistance, and challenges to implementation 
from towns and municipalities. 
DPFR has neither the expertise nor the ﬁlnding to support this program, to develop training and 
continuing education, or to support local planning efforts. The relocation and ongoing support of 
this program would divert staff from their critical core functions resulting in the delay in 
processing license applications, issuing licenses, and handling consumer complaints. The bill 
would require substantial funding from the General Fund to support the work of consultants and 
experts to develop the structure and expertise necessary to implement this program within DPFR. 
The printed bill would also require the Department to engage in functions well outside its 
statutory mission and expertise, such as developing and administering exams, which OPOR 
outsources to national companies with relevant expertise to develop and provide training and 
continuing education that OPOR licensees are currently responsible for identifying and procuring 
on their own. 
The costs associated with the suggested move to PFR or any other department would be 
signiﬁcant. The bill creates a new program with a governing board and would require staff with 
technical expertise. We would need a dedicated manager with relevant expertise, inspectors, and 
additional support staff. We would also have to hire a training coordinator and other staff to 
develop and provide training for local municipal and town planners. 
While we thank the sponsor for his confidence in DPFR by naming it as the location of MUBEC 
in the printed bill, we believe that the State Fire Marshal’s Ofﬁce in the Department of Public 
Safety is the appropriate location for MUBEC and the Standards Board. That said, 
representatives of DPFR will participate in the study proposed by the amendment. 
On a ﬁnal note, having participated in similar studies of the kind proposed in the amendment, I 
hope the December 6, 2023, report date will provide the study group sufficient time to produce 
meaningful recommendations to the Committee. 
Thank you.
