Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services, my name is Kalie Hess, I live in Southwest Harbor, and I'm here to 
testify in support of LD 1837 
I want to help make the systemic challenges we are facing in our oral health system real by 
sharing with you my own experience, and demonstrate the extent to which our oral health 
system is crumbling, even for people with relative privilege like me and my family 
I have federal employee dental insurance through my spouse and I work in the oral health ﬁeld 
so I have a deeper understanding than most about how and when to access services for me and 
my children I have complete ﬂexibility in myiob — particularly for dental appointmentsl And,I 
have had routine dental coverage and a dedicated dental home for my whole life 
Then one thing changed we moved to Hancock county in 2022 to be closer to family This one 
life change had the impact of totally discharging my family from the dental system that I had 
always been able to rely on All of a sudden, no longer an established patient with a dental 
home, I was waiting years for a dental cleaning I called a colleague and we explored other ways 
that I could get a cleaning while waiung for my new dental home to be established l called 
about 8 independent practice dental hygienists who were booking out as far as my dentist or 
who were not taking new patients Fortunately, my colleague recommended I try getting a 
hygiene appointment at the University of Maine at Augusta Dental Hygiene School and it was 
one of the best dental experiences I have had — but it required taking an hour and a half to drive 
there and the appointment took 4 hours as it was a teaching experience for the student 
Furthermore, it has been incredibly challenging to break into the dental system with new 
children When my daughters were 6 months old I began trying to get an appointment for their 
ﬁrst visit, which ultimately wasn't able to happen until they were about 16 months old Being 
able to get routine preventive care requires getting on wait lists and calling our dental practice 
to beg them to at least place some ﬂuoride varnish on my girls’ teeth in between long gaps in 
hygiene appointments Our dental practices are completely full already, yet children are being 
born every day and there are few, if any, slots for them to enter into care and receive the 
prevention that we know is critical to preventing dental caries 
I know that the true impacts of LD 1837 are not immediately clear For me, I see incredible 
potential to support the Maine CDC and MaineCare to really begin to ﬁx the systemic issues in 
our oral health system that are even impacting me, despite having a signiﬁcant amount of 
privilege in navigating getting oral health care From my work at the Children's Oral Health 
Network, I know that these issues are solvable. Yet, it takes capacity and commitment from the 
State in order to bring to scale the solutions to ensure that oral health care IS readily accessible 
for all 
Thank you for your consideration of my testimony I'm happy to answer any questions
