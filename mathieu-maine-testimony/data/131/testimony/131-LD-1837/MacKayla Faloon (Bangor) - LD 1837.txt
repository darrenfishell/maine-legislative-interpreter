Dear
Representatives
of
Bangor
and
members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services
Committee.
My
name
is
MacKayla
Faloon,
and
I
am
a
recent
graduate
of
the
University
of
Maineâ€™s
Social
Work
Undergraduate
program.
I
am
writing
today
in
support
of
LD
1837:
An
Act
to
Increase
Oral
Health
Services.
This
bill
is
important
to
me,
not
only
as
a
social
worker
about
to
work
in
the
field,
but
also
as
a
mom.
As
a
social
worker,
I
believe
that
everyone
should
have
access
to
care
regardless
of
their
financial
situation.
Providing
oral
health
care,
preventative
or
otherwise,
in
a
school
setting
can
be
huge
for
a
child
living
in
poverty
and
unable
to
receive
oral
health
care.
According
to
the
CDC,
(1)
children
in
low-income
families
are
twice
as
likely
to
have
cavities;
and
(2)
children
with
poor
oral
health
often
miss
more
school
and
have
lower
grades
than
children
without
cavities.
As
a
mom
with
MaineCare,
there
are
very
few
places
I
am
able
to
take
my
child
for
dental
care
who
will
accept
our
insurance,
and
the
places
that
do
have
a
long
wait
list
for
appointments.
I
do
not
have
the
money
to
pay
out
of
pocket
to
get
my
child
oral
health
care,
so
having
school-based
oral
health
care
would
be
a
big
relief
for
myself
and
my
family.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
