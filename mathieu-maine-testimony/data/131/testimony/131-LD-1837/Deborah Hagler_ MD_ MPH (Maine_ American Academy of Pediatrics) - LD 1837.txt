Testimony in support of LD 1837:  ‘An Act to Increase Oral Health Services ’ 
 
Senator Baldacci and Representative Meyer and esteemed members of the Health 
and Human Services Committee,  my name is Deborah Hagler. I reside in Harpswell. I have practiced General Pediatrics for 26 years in Brunswick. I am the imm ediate 
past President of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics . 
 If you have ever had an urgent visit to the dentist for a toothache you inherently understand what decades of research has confirmed -  oral health is linked inextricably 
to our overall well -being, health, and quality of life.  Chronic inflammation and  disease 
in the oral cavity is linked to inflammatory processes in the body.
1 The better you take 
care of your teeth the healthier the body. Sadly, for children, dental caries is the most 
common chronic illness of childhood.  Many children lack access to routine dental care 
in Maine. This situation is especially dire as we do not have the dental workforce to meet needs.  
 
LD 1837 seeks to build Maine’s capacity to care for the oral health needs of our state - 
especially our youth by expanding the School Oral Healt h Program to all Public 
Schools and asking Mainecare to pilot payment strategies to support this work. In addition, this bill  helps build our public health prevention infrastructure at the Maine 
CDC  by making  the temporary Oral Health Positions Permanent.   
 
Poor oral hygiene is associated with a host of chronic illnesses including 
cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and prostate cancer. Investing in the 
infrastructure that may help in these debilitating illnesses2 and leading drivers of 
mortality is an investment in the people of Maine.  
 
The Maine AAP strongly supports  and asks for the passage of  LD1837.
