This
is
not
a
statement
against
childhood
lead
poisoning
prevention,
but
rather
an
account
of
our
experience
of
being
new
parents
and
homeowners
who
have
been
navigating
the
challenges
of
an
unexpected
expense
in
excess
of
$100,000.
We,
like
many
young
families
in
Portland
and
beyond,
have
found
ourselves
in
the
increasingly
common
situation
of
being
new
parents
whose
one-year-old
child
had
elevated
blood
lead
levels
and
were
subsequently
faced
with
the
immense
financial
and
logistical
burden
of
a
state-mandated
lead
abatement
order.
In
addition
to
being
new
parents,
we
are
also
new
owners
of
a
West
End
three-unit.
The
house
is
very
typical
and
shares
the
common
materials
of
the
time
with
many
of
the
surrounding
homes.
One
material,
in
particular,
is
lead
paint.
Our
house
is
not
dilapidated
or
in
a
state
of
disrepair,
it
just
happens
to
be
old.
The
windows,
doors,
and
trim
have
lead
paint
beneath
the
more
recent
coats
of
latex
paint.
When
a
door
is
shut,
an
old
window
opened,
or
trim
bumped
into,
a
small
amount
of
lead
dust
can
be
created
that
settles
on
the
floor.
The
lead
dust
gets
on
a
child's
hands
and
the
child
puts
their
hands
in
their
mouth
as
children
do.
This
is
a
typical
scenario
of
how
a
child
gets
an
elevated
blood
lead
level.
When
the
process
began,
one
of
our
units
had
just
become
vacant
and
we
learnt
that
we
were
not
allowed
to
rent
the
unit
until
the
lead
abatement
process
was
completed
and
all
postings
were
removed.
In
a
city
with
a
housing
crisis,
this
decision
seems
illogical,
since
our
unit
(and
presumably
many
other
unoccupied
units
in
houses
under
a
state-mandated
abatement
order)
would
have
been
perfectly
safe
for
adults
to
live
in.
From
start
to
finish,
the
abatement
process
took
8.5
months
to
complete,
therefore
throughout
this
process
weâ€™ve
lost
in
excess
of
$16000
in
rental
income
alone
all
while
a
perfectly
fine
unit
has
been
unrentable
due
to
current
regulations.
Owning
and
maintaining
a
multifamily
home
in
Portland
is
expensive
and
homeowners
rely
on
steady
rental
income
to
make
ends
meet.
Being
faced
with
expenses
of
over
$100,000
and
then
losing
50%
of
our
rental
income
on
top
was
a
challenge
to
say
the
least.
An
option
to
rent
a
vacant
unit
would
have
made
a
significant
difference
for
us
and
I
hope
that
future
home
owners
may
have
the
option
to
do
so.
To
conclude,
I
would
like
you
to
please
consider
why
existing
tenants
are
allowed
to
remain
in
their
unit,
while
renting
a
vacant
unit
to
new
low-risk
tenants
is
not?
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
