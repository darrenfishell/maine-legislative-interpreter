Re: L.D. 1728, An Act to Ensure Access to Federally Approved Opioid Overdose-reversing 
Medication 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Committee: 
This bill would amend a number of provisions in the Maine Criminal Code (17-A M.R.S. Ch. 45, 
“Drugs”), the Education Code (20-A M.R.S. Ch. 223, Subchapter 1, “Student Health”), the 
Health and Welfare Code (22 M.R.S., Ch. 556-A, “Opioids”), the Maine Insurance Code (24-A 
M.R.S., Ch. 23, “Trade Practices and Frauds”), and the Professions and Occupations Code (32 
M.R.S., Ch. 2B, “Maine Emergency Medical Services Act of 1982” and Ch. 117, “Maine 
Pharmacy Act”) to add other opioid overdose-reducing medications to statutes governing 
naloxone hydrochloride, if approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on the provisions of L.D. 1728 affecting Titles 17-A, 
20-A, 22, and 32.  Our comments are limited to the provisions affecting Title 24-A, which we 
support.  The 129th Legislature enacted  PL 2019, c. 203, “An Act to Prohibit Consideration of 
Naloxone Purchases in Life Insurance Underwriting” (codified at 24-A M.R.S. § 2159-E), 
prohibiting life insurers from discriminating against individuals who have been issued 
prescriptions for naloxone hydrochloride or who have purchased naloxone hydrochloride in 
accordance with 22 M.R.S. § 2353.  Section 2159-E specifically prohibits insurers from limiting 
coverage or refusing to issue or renew coverage, considering the fact that an individual has been 
issued a prescription or has purchased such medications when determining the premium rate for 
that individual, or otherwise discriminating in the offering, issuance, cancellation, amount of 
coverage, price, or any other condition of a life insurance policy without any additional actuarial 
justification.   
L.D. 1728 would amend Section 2159-E to expand the list of prescription medications that may 
not be considered in life insurance underwriting to include other overdose-reversing medications 
that the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved.  We believe this is a sensible 
approach consistent with current law.
