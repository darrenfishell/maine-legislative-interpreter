Director, Maine Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (Maine EMS)  
Department of Public Safety  
Neither For Nor Against  LD 1728 
“An Act to Ensure Access to Federally Approved Opioid Overdose -reversing Medication ” 
Presented by  Senator Moore of Washington County  
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES  
Public Hearing: May 10, 2023 , at 10:00 AM 
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human  Services : 
 
My name is Sam Hurley , and I am the Director of Maine Emergency Medical Services, Maine 
EMS, within the Department of Public Safety.  I am testifying  on behalf of Maine Department of 
Public Safety and Maine EMS  neither for nor against  LD 1728, “An Act to Ensure Access to 
Federally Approved Opioid Overdose -reversing Medication .” 
 
Maine EMS understands that the National Institutes of Health has encouraged drug 
manufacturers to continue work on the ongoing development of opioid overdose reversal agents. 
As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently  approved additional 
pharmacological agents that may be used in the treatment of persons experiencing an opioid 
overdose. We applaud the bill sponsor and the Legislature’s attention to the emerging clinical 
advances and appreciate amendments referenced in this proposed legislation.  
 
As written, Maine EMS has no opposition to this language; however, it is imperative  that the 
Medical Direction and Practices Board, the 14-member Board  comprised of emergency 
Page 2 of 2 
 physicians, EMS clinicians, a nd a pharmacist, retain the full authority to determine which 
pharmacological  interventions are most appropriate  operationally and clinically  for the out -of-
hospital environment where EMS clinicians practice.  
 
It should be noted that there are other pieces of legislation  impacting the EMS -related 
components of statutes referenced in this proposal , including LD 981.  It will be important to 
ensure that if both pieces of legislation are implemented, the changes are appropriately reflected.  
 
Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any additional questions, comments, or concerns 
that we may be able to address. W e appreciate the opportunity to present to the committee.  
 
Thank you.
