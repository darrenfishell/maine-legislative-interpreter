Testimony of Debra Mclntyre, Executive Director, on behalf of the members of the Maine 
Curriculum Leaders Association, testifying against LD 257 An Act to Provide for a Later 
Starting Time for High School. 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and esteemed members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee, my name is Debra Mclntyre and I am the Executive Director of the 
Maine Curriculum Leaders Association. On behalf of the members of MCLA l am testifying in 
opposition to LD 257 An Act to Provide for a Later Starting Time for High School. 
As educators we all have an understanding of the importance of getting enough sleep, 
especially the CDC’s recommendations that teenagers aged 13 to 18 should regularly sleep 8 to 
10 hours per day for good health. 
However, in a poll of MCLA members, many districts have researched a later start time for their 
high schools but the barriers were insurmountable. Some roadblocks for districts are 
transportation (example: currently have 1 bus run for all students in the district and with a later 
start time would need to add additional routes (no drivers), the hardship on some families (older 
siblings providing care, changes to work times/needs for daycare), regional CTE programming, 
and student commitments (work, athletics), to name a few. Of the member districts responding 
to our sun/ey, one third of the districts currently start their high school at 8:00 or later. 
We believe that the school schedule which includes start and end times should continue to bea 
matter for each district's school board to decide. Local control allows districts to accommodate 
the needs of their families and communities based on the unique requirements of their region. 
For these reasons MCLA opposes LD 257. Thank you for your time.
