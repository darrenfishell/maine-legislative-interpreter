Testimony of Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Favor of  
LD257, An Act to Provide for Later  starting Time for High Schools  
 
Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan and members of the Committee on Education and Cultural 
Affairs, my name is Dr. Deborah Hagler. I reside in Harpswell and am the Immediate Past P resident of the 
Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics .  I am testifying on behalf of the chapter in favor of LD  
257, an Act to Pr ovide for Later Starting Times for High  Schools.  I have practiced pediatrics in the Brunswick 
region for the last 25 years. My medical degree is from Cornell Medical College, I did my pediatrics training at 
the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia,  and I received a Master of Public Health focusing on pediatric and 
adolescent mental health from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.  
 Anyone with a teenager in their lives recalls a moment when they looked at  the young person and thought, 
wow, what happened to the little boy or girl?  It seems they suddenly  morphed into young adults with a host of 
new needs  and challenges .  Many changes occur to produce this metamorphosis - one of the most important  is 
a change in sleep. Teens , on average, need more of it  than most people believe – they need 8.5 to 9.5 hours 
each night .  Their biological clock shifts by about 2 hours  as they enter mid- adolescence,  and it  tends to take 
longer for them to fall asleep.  Without current societal pressures , many teens  would naturally feel very 
comfortable falling asleep at 11 and waking around 8am.
1 However , data from the Youth Risk Behavioral 
Health Survey reveal s almost 73% of US high school students get less than 8 hours of sleep a night , with 22% 
getting less than 6 hours.2 
 Sleep, a critical function  preserved across all species, plays key roles in both physical and mental well-being. 
Our immune system functions best when sleeping – and much of chi ldren’s g rowth occurs during their sleeping 
hours .  Sleep is critical for laying down memories, mood regulation, and focus. Chronic poor sleep is 
associated with an increased risk of developing mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, poor  decision 
making, increased tendency to participate in high- risk behaviors and poorer academic outcomes. Additionally , 
poor sleep has been linked to less physical activity and has been shown to be a contributing factor to the 
development of obesity.

 Starting school later for high school students has indeed been demonstrated to increase weekday sleep duration, and additional studies have further  shown increased school attendance, increased academic 
performance, a decrease in the number of reported depressive symptoms, and a decrease in the number  of 
automobile accidents among adolescent drivers.

 Most people are aware that adolescents are increasingly struggling with significant mental and behavioral health challenges - so much so , that several leading children's health organizations  including the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry  and the Children’s Hospital 
Association have declared a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health.
5 
 Obviously, many complex factors are contributing to this national emergency , with poor sleep just one piece of 
this puzzle .  Providing more sleep for students by following their natural biologic rhythms offers the potential to 
broadly intervene and support the health and well -being of our youth.   LD 257 is aligned with AAP policy which 
supports and encourages  later start times for high school students
1.  The Maine Chapter of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics strongly urges you to support this legislation.  This is one way we can support youth that 
can make a significant  difference to their wellbeing,  now and in each child ’s future.
