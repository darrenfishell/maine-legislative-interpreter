The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in 2014 that middle and high 
schools begin instruction no earlier than 8:30 a.m based on ample research 
demonstrating the correlation between later high school start times and improved 
sleep in teens. Improved sleep at a population level can bring about a range of 
positive outcomes including improvements in the health and safety of students. I 
strongly support the proposed Act providing for a later starting time for high school 
students.
