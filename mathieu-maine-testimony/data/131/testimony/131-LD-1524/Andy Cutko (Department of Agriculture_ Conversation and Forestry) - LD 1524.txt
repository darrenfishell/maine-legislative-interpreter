NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST LD 1524 
 
Act to Eliminate the Excise Tax on Recreational Vehicles and Permit Municipal Adoption of 
Fees to Cover the Cost of Municipal Services to Campgrounds and Recreational Vehicle Park 
 
April 26, 2023 
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation, my name is Andy Cutko, and I am the Director of the Maine Bureau of 
Parks and Lands (BPL). I am writing on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry (DACF) neither for nor against LD 1524, An Act to Eliminate the Excise Tax on 
Recreational Vehicles and Permit Municipal Adoption of Fees to Cover the Cost of Municipal 
Services to Campgrounds and Recreational Vehicle Park.   
 
Among other aims, this bill would permit municipalities to impose fees on campgrounds or parks 
that host recreational vehicles. If this legislation moves forward, the Bureau recommends that 
State Parks be exempt from municipal fees.  
 
The state of Maine, through the Bureau of Parks and Lands, owns and manages twelve popular 
campgrounds across the state; eleven of these host recreational vehicles. These campgrounds 
returned more than $750,000 to the Stateâ€™s General Fund last year and brought in countless more 
funds through indirect revenues. Through 12 M.R.S. 1820, seven percent of day use and camping 
fees from State Parks and Historic Sites are paid to the municipalities that contain those parks. Through 
this mechanism, in 2022, the state paid $578,985 to municipalities across the state.  Any fees BPL were to 
pay under this bill would detract from its ability to help maintain State Parks and Historic Sites, and the 
state would likely need to increase campground fees to offset these additional costs.      
 
In light of the many values State Parks provide to Maine and the existing funding mechanisms for 
municipalities, we hope that State Park campgrounds would be exempt from any fees enabled by this bill.   
 
Thank you for your consideration of this information.
