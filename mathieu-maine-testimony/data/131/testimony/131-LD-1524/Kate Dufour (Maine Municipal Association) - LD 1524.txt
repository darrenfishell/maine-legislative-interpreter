Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association 
In Opposition to 
LD 1524, An Act to Eliminate the Excise Tax on Recreational Vehicles and Permit Municipal 
Adoption of Fees to Cover the Cost of Municipal Services to Campgrounds and Recreational 
Vehicle Parks 
April 26, 2023 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in opposition to LD 1524 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association ’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest. 
While municipal leaders appreciate the approach envisioned in the bill that enables 
municipalities to recoup lost revenue associated with exempting certain recreational vehicles 
(RV) from payment of the excise tax, it is ineffective solution for many communities. Because 
RVs are registered and assessed excise taxes in all communities, even in those without 
campgrounds, there is no opportunity in many communities to recoup the losses. Additionally, 
the authority to do so comes with added administrative burdens. 
If the state is truly interested in providing this level of tax relief, then the Legislature 
should ﬁnd the revenues, not otherwise committed to municipalities, to administer, implement 
and enforce the program. 
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue. If you have any 
questions about the Association ’s position on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at 
kdufour@memun.org or 1-800-452-8786.
