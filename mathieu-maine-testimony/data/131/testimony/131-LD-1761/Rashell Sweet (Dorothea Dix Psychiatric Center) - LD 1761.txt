Rashell Sweet
Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center
LD 1761
Hello, my name is Rashell Sweet. I live in Greenbush, Maine. I have worked at work 
at Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center for the past three and a half years. Working here is
extremely rewarding, although it can also be dangerous at times. In the short amount 
of time that I have worked here, I have been threatened by patients. I have been 
slammed in the knees with a chair, hit with shoes, and I have seen coworkers out of 
work for extended periods of time because they have been assaulted by patients and 
hurt badly enough that they could not work until they recovered. 
There are many years ahead of me working here at Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center. I
have pondered at times, what will my 120lb self be able to handle at 50/60/70 years 
old. Will I be able to sprint up 3 flights of stairs when a code is called? Will I be able 
to heal as quickly if I am injured if assaulted or if I am injured restraining a violent 
patient? Unfortunately, as I get older the answer there is no. I wonâ€™t heal as quickly as
I do now. 
Our job is still very necessary. Everyone is extremely important and valuable. As 
patients stabilize, we can get to know them for the wonderful people they are, they are
able to control their behaviors in a more appropriate manner. They are then able to go 
back into their community stable and enjoy their life. 
With a younger less vulnerable group of staff available at Dorothea Dix Psychiatric 
Center, that will make caring for them during their time of crisis more possible and 
productive. With less injuries. 
Thank you very much for your time, I appreciate the opportunity to share my 
thoughts. For the patients and for the staff, I ask that you please support this 
legislation. 
Sincerely, 
Rashell Sweet
