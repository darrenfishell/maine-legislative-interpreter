Workmg people who serve the publrc as mental health workers do1ng cr1ses outreach and drrect 
care 1n commumty-based and res1dent1al settmgs perform emotlonally strenuous and phys1cally 
demandmg work These workers prov1de a great pubhc beneﬁt to everyone whrle facmg danger,

Speclal Plan that beneﬁt workmg people As you Work on ﬁxmg the problems w1th the system 
that result m workers bemg left out of the opportumty to retrre w1th drgmty and respect, we ask 
that you make sure these mental health workers prov1d1ng drrect care be mcluded
