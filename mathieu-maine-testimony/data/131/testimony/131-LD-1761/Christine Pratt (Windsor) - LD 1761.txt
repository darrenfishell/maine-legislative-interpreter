I have worked a RPC for 6 and 1/2 years as a Mental Health worker II. I have seen 
many of my co workers get severely injured while working with patients. I have seen 
patients cause concussions, broken legs, most of the bones in the face broken to the 
point of not being able to work any more, stitches on the face from being punched and
many other kinds of injuries. Our patients are very sick and sometimes have to be 
restrained from hurting themselves or others including staff they can be very 
combative. I feel like we literary go into battle every day when we go into work. I 
have been lucky enough to not have been on the receiving end of this.
 As I am an older woman it is getting increasingly difficult to be in a position where I 
would have to help restrain a patient effectively so no one gets hurt. We work 12 hour
shift and often get mandated to work longer hours ( I work the overnight shift) which 
wears on an older person both mentally and physically. I have high blood pressure, 
back and joint pain. Some days it is even hard to get out of bed knowing I have to go 
into work. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify about why this legislation should be 
considered.
