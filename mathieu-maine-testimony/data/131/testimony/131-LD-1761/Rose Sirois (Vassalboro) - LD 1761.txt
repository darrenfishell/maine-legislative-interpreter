To whom it may concern:
My name is Rose Marie Sirois; I live in Vassalboro, Maine and I work at Riverview 
Psychiatric Center.  I have been employed there for 36 years.  A career as a caregiver 
for people with severe chronic mental illness and disabilities.  It has been my honor to
do so without regret.  I implore that you would please support this legislation.
Over the years, I have witnessed multiple staff who have been injured and 
traumatized in major ways to the point of resigning and/or going on disability.  One of
which was a staff member, while checking a patient for safety, was grabbed by the 
hair in the back of the head then thrashed backwards and forwards, thus causing 
permanent neck damage and non-stop headacheshis , causing this person to leave the 
hospital.  Another was a staff member whose foot was broken in several places 
requiring surgery and a head concussion, who also left the hospital.
I, myself was hit in the head by two different patients resulting in trauma and 
concussions and choked by a patient.
It is a proven clinical fact after the age of 30 years old, a person will begin to lose 
body muscle and cognitive function which decreases the reaction time significantly.  
The older one becomes, the ability to react physically and mentally is not as efficient; 
therefore, placing one at a higher risk for injury.
Thank you for taking the time to read my testimony and I strongly plead with you to 
support the proposed legislation.
