Hello, My name is Arwen Peterson, I am currently employed as a Crisis Response 
Worker for the Office of Aging and Disability Services Region I covering Oxford, 
York and Cumberland Counties. The nature of our work involves risk of injury while 
we are often called to respond to adult clients in Crisis; presenting aggressive, 
assaultive and violent behavior. Restraint training is mandatory and is expected to be 
utilized when necessary to keep clients safe. It is not uncommon to be in these 
situations as the sole Crisis Response Worker tasked with maintaining safety. The 
nature of our work requires both physical and mental dexterity. As we age the 
physical aspect of our job becomes more challenging. Due to this, I ask you please 
support this legislation.
