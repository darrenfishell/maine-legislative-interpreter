In Support of LD 1761, An Ac to Include Certain Mental Health Workers Under the 1998 
Special Plan for Re�rement, Sponsored by Senate President Troy Jackson  
 
Before the Joint Standing Commitee on Labor and Housing  
1 PM Wednesday, May 3, 2023, Cross Building Room 202 
 
Senator Tipping , Representa�ve Roeder , members of the Commitee on Labor and Housing , I’m 
Jeﬀ McCabe, director of poli�cs and legisla�on for the Maine Service Employees Associa�on, 
Local 1989 of the Service Employees Interna�onal Union. We are a labor union represen�ng 
over 13,000 Maine workers, including workers at both Riverview Psychiatric Center and Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center. We are here in support of LD 1761 and ask you to ensure it covers all mental health workers and workers  who are interac�ng with pa�ent popula�ons .  
 Mental health workers and their colleagues at Dorothea Dix and Riverview do challenging and physically demanding work, o�en under dangerous condi�ons. As stated in job descrip�ons, 
“Riverview Psychiatric Center, in collabora�on with the community, is a center for best prac�ce, 
treatment, educa�on and research, for individuals with serious, persistent mental illness, a nd 
co-occurring substance use disorders.” These workers  o�en encounter mental, verbal, and 
physical abuse while at work, and face a higher likelihood of on -the-job injuries.  The pa�ents 
they work with are o�en at risk of harming themselves or others , so workers must remain 
constantly aware of their surroundings  to keep both themselves and their pa�ents safe. We 
encourage you to read the writen tes�mony submited by workers w ho can speak more to the 
diﬃcult nature of their work.  
 As many of you are aware, the 1998 Special Plan allows workers to re�re at age 55 with 25 years of service . The workers eligible for this special plan do work that is high risk, stressful, and 
o�en trauma�c.  Moving other workers doing similar jobs into the 1998 Special Plan would be 
an incen�ve to not only hire new workers, but also to retain the talented and experienced workers currently employed.  It would also show thanks and apprecia�on to the Mainers who 
do th ese incredibly diﬃcult jobs.  
 A recent Bangor Daily News  ar�cle  reported that nearly 1 in 6 Maine state jobs are unﬁlled; 
that’s just over 2,100 vacancies . These vacancies have impacted  Riverview Psychiatric Center 
and Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center as well; there are curre ntly eleven openings listed on the 
Maine.gov website for Riverview alone.  When these posi�ons remain unﬁlled, it not only makes 
work more challenging for those who remain, but for workers in these facili�es it can also make their jobs more dangerous. Maintaining staﬃng levels is cri�cal across all sectors of state 
governme nt. The open posi�ons include nurses, psychiatrists, mental health workers, and 
psychologist s, among others .

 This is clearly diﬃcult and dangerous work, yet the State has consistently fallen short when it 
comes to respec�ng, protec�ng and paying the se workers fairly for their labor. As you may 
know, on average, State employees make 15% less than their counterparts throughout New England, even a�er adjus�ng for regional pay diﬀerences, according to the State of Maine 
Market Study Report dated Nov. 20, 2020. Adding these workers to the 1998 Special Plan would 
be a step in the right direc�on towards ensuring that we are giving them the respect and 
compensa�on th at they deserve.  
 
Thank you and I would be happy to answer any ques�ons.
