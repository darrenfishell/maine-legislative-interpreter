Rita Ladd
Riverview Psychiatric Center
LD 1761
Hello. My name is Rita Ladd and I have been working at Riverview Psychiatric 
Center for over 6 years. I am 58 years old. I can attest that working the standard 12 
hour shifts here at Riverview are very rough. I have been punched in the face, had hot 
coffee thrown at me, I have been verbally abused frequently by patients. The job is 
very dangerous and demanding, esp for us older individuals. Quite often when verbal 
de-escalation techniques don't work, staff have to go "hands-on" with patients and we 
employees end up with injuries. I have seen some very serious patient to staff 
assaults. I personally know of 5 coworkers who were injured and never came back to 
work. The job is also extremely emotionally demanding and fast paced. I strongly 
encourage that RPC workers at least 55 years of age with at least 25 years of service 
be allowed to retire. They have well earned it! I thank you for your time and 
consideration.
