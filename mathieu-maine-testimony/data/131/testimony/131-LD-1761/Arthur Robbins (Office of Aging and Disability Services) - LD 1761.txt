Arthur Robbins
Office of Aging and Disability Services
LD 1761
Hello, my name is Arthur Robbins. I work as a Crisis Response Worker for the Office
of Aging and Disability Services and cover the counties of Cumberland, York, and 
Oxford. There is a certain level of inherent risk of injury while preforming this work 
due to trying to help adults who at times are not in control and acting out in a very 
violent and aggressive manner. Restraint training is mandatory and expected to be 
utilized as necessary to maintain safety. This physical part of the job is naturally more
difficult to safely implement as one ages. Due to this, I ask that you please support 
this sensible legislation.
