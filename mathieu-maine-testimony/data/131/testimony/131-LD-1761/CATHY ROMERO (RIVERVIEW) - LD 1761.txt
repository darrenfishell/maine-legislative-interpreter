MY NAME IS CATHY ROMERO, I LIVE IN WINSLOW MAINE. I WORK AT 
RIVERVIEW  AND I SUPPORT LD 1761 AN ACT TO INCLUDE CERTAIN 
MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS UNDER THE 1998 SPECIAL PLAN FOR 
RETIREMENT.
I HAVE WORKED AT RIVERVIEW AND AMHI FOR THE PAST 35 YEARS. I 
HAVE SEEN MANY GOOD THINGS HAPPEN. HAVE SEEN PATIENTS COME 
IN AT THERE WORST AND LEAVE AT THERE BEST. I HAVE ALSO SEEN 
AND FELT PHYSICAL
PAIN FROM ASSAULTIVE PATIENTS. I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD MY 
SHOULDER,  HAD HAIR PULLED OUT THE SIZE OF HALF DOLLAR, 
PUNCHED IN THE FACE, SPIT AT AND NOT TO MENTION THE MENTAL 
ABUSE FROM THE PATIENTS . I KNOW THAT IT DOES NOT COMPARE TO 
THE WORK OF A PRISON GUARD OR POLICE BUT THE STRESS IS REAL 
AND CONSTANT. WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME TOOLS THAT THE PRISON
OR POLICE HAVE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. ALL WE HAVE IS OUR 
VOICE AND OTHER STAFF MEMBERS. AFTER 35 YEARS  Iâ€™M TIRED AND I 
WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I GAVE 100% BUT THE TRUTH IS CAN 
ANYONE SAY THAT AFTER 35 YRS MY BEST MAY NOT BE ENOUGH          
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME FOR LISTENING.
