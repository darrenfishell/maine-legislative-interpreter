LD 1761
Good afternoon,
I have been employed as a Registered Nurse at Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center in 
Bangor since June 10th, 1996. It is coming up on 27 years in a little over 1 month, I 
am 51 years old. I have been attacked verbally and physically, mandated to cover 
shifts after 12 hours work already and exposed to stressful and PTSD trauma causing 
events every day I work. We accept patients from jails, prisons and emergency rooms.
Often, they arrived accompanied by several police officers/cruisers in hand cuffs and 
are released into our care, where we take care of them without guns, clubs or mace. I 
love what I do and care deeply for my patients, but I see no way that I can continue to 
do this until I’m 62 years old neither mentally nor physically. It most definitely takes 
a toll. I am interested (Actually I’m praying) for LD1761 to become a law. 
I consider it a blessing to take care of our state's mentally ill population, but it takes 
an amount of resilience, strength and fortitude that is unable to be maintained in a 
healthy way for longer than 25 years.
