LD 1761
Hello. My Name is Matt Pritchard. I work for the office of aging and disability 
services (DS CRISIS TEAM). I am writing in favor of this act LD 1761. As Crisis 
Workers in the mental health field we deal with a number of challenging behaviors on
both a mental and physical level. As a person ages it becomes harder to manage these 
behaviors especially on the physical level. Physical restraints are very hard for 
someone in their 60's and many injuries have occurred. Physical and mental 
exhaustion commonly occur. If you you could strongly consider passing LD 1761 it 
would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
