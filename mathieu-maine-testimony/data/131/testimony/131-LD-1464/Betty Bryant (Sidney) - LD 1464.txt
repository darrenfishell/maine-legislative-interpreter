LD 1464
My name is Betty Bryant and I live in Sidney. I want to share my experience with 
unemployment with the committee and provide comments in support of LD 1464, 
legislation to eliminate the waiting week for unemployment insurance.
 
I have been a seasonal employee at LL Bean and have struggled with alternate base 
periods due to the seasonal nature of my job. Back in January I was laid off and by 
February had run out of weeks of unemployment. I had to wait until March 26th for 
the new benefit year to start, at which time I filed a new claim. This new claim had 
the required waiting week. Basically the existence of the waiting week resulted in me 
being behind on any income for a total of four weeks.
 
Being required to wait for a week to get your first week of unemployment feels 
arbitrary. Things move so quickly nowadays. It feels like missing out on a week of 
money just makes it harder to pay the bills and stay afloat. I think you should pass this
bill and get rid of the waiting week so people don’t fall further behind when they lose 
work.
 
I do everything right, play be the rules an do honest work. I don’t want to go into all 
the details about my experience with unemployment, but if people have questions 
about my situation I am happy to answer. I know that this change would help people 
like me and I think you should vote for this bill.
