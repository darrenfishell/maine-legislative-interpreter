LD 1464 - An Act to Remove the Waiting Period for Benefits Under Maine's 
Unemployment Insurance System Mr Speaker, Members of the Committee
LINDA HASKELL, Garland, Maine opposition to this LD1464. 
The waiting period of one week is a must in our State of Maine. It has served well for 
all of us in the history of this Law/Statute. There was a purpose for instituting this 
time period and it should remain in its standing. Also, individuals going onto 
unemployment should be out there searching for jobs in the meantime. The State of 
Maine has numerous entrepreneurs starting businesses in the last few years of this 
terrible infliction of covid and its mass production of fear promoted to harm the 
economy. The need to live off of the government, which is supported by the working 
force, needs to stop. I oppose LD1464
