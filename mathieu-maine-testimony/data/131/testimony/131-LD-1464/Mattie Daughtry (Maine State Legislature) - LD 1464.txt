Testimony ofSenator Mattie Daaghtry introducing 
LD 1464, An Act to Remove the Waiting Period for Beneﬁts Under Maine’s 
Unemployment Insurance System 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
April I9, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Esteemed Members ofthe Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing, my name is Mattie Daughtry, and l proudly represent Senate 
District 23, which includes Brunswick, Freeport, Ielarpswell, Pownal, Chebeague Island, and part 
ot‘Yannouth. Today l am pleased to introduce LD 1464, "An Act to Remove the Waiting Period 
for Beneﬁts Under Maine’s Unemployment Insurance System.” 
LD 1464 is a simple, straightforward bill. It would eliminate the waiting period for Maine 
workers who are applying for unemployment beneﬁts. ln today’s economy, we know that the 
majority ofwage workers live paycheck to paycheck. Inﬂation has made that reality even 
harsher, particularly for low-wage workers, women, people of color, and young families. These 
workers literally cannot afford to miss even one week of pay, especially since they lost theirjobs 
and the unemployment benefit is less than their regular earnings. Unless workers exhaust the full 
26 weeks ofbenetits, they are denied a week olibenelits. According to the l;.l_,__§{;__{}f_gg_;g_rtii"g_ji;tNoVt_ ‘ 
_i___.._§__t_i?_§}_l:, the average duration ofa Ul claim was 15.8 weeks, with 60 percent ofbenetit recipients 
finding work prior to the exhaustion oftheir benefits. ln other words, it’s very likely that Maine 
workers will ﬁnd employment within the 26 weeks of beneﬁts, so they lose that full first week of 
benefits. This hurts our families, and it hurts our economy."
' 
When unemployment benefits began, the waiting period gave the bureaucracy time to process the 
application. ln the l98()s, a one-week waiting period was reasonable. lt took time, and the 
processing technology was slower then. This is no longer the case. To continue the one-week 
waiting period is a throwback to an outdated process. The Department of Labor does not needa 
week to process applications. ln tact, when there was a large volume of applications during the 
peak months of the COVID-l9 pandemic, the Department waived the waiting period. Other 
states have waived their waiting periods, and Maine should join them. 
As we move forward, l hope that we can work together to limit the impact waiving the waiting 
period would have on the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. If we schedule the waiver at the 
right time, then we can ensure there will be no major tax increase on employers or workers. With 
Maine’ s employment numbers being as good as they are, now is the time to make this change.
l
No one plans to lose theirjob, and everyone pays into the system, so let’s remove the waiting 
period. Let’ s give people the hard-earned beneﬁts they deserve while they continue to pay their 
bills, support their families, and ﬁnd anotherjob. 
I thank you for your time, and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
