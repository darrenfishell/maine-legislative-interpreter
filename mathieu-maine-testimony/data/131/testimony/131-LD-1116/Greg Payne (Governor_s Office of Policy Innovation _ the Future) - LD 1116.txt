Testimony Neither For, Nor Against  
L.D. 1 116, An Act to Provide Rural Sober Living Housing for Mothers  
  
April 25, 2023  
  
Senator Tipping , Representative Roeder , and distinguished members of the Joint Standing  
Committee on Labor and Housing, my name is Greg Payne and I serve as  the Senior Advisor on 
Housing  Policy  in the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future. I am here today to 
offer testimony neither for, nor against  L.D. 1116, An Act to Provide Rural Sober Living 
Housing for Mothers .  
  
We strongly agree that there  is a significant shortage of rec overy residences in Maine, including 
those which would support families in rural areas of the state. Such resources can serve as an 
important means by which to keep families together  while parents are recovering from substance 
use disorder . 
 
We do have con cerns with some of the details of the proposal as written, including the 1 :1 
matching requirement, which will likely be very difficult for local organizations to satisfy, as 
well as the contractual obligations placed on MaineHousing , and the limit on uses which do not 
include  acquisition costs.  
 
We welcome the opportunity to work with the bill’s sponsor, members of the Committee, and 
other stakeholders  to find pathways that will support the creation of more recovery residences  in 
Maine in the future.  
  
Thank you for your consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact me  if my office may be of 
further assistance.
