Dear Chairs Tipping, Roeder and Members of the Committee:
As a community, we have a responsibility to support recovery for those who are 
struggling with addiction and mental health disorders. Our community is only as 
strong as our weakest link, and it is important that we show our support for those who
are trying to overcome their illness and get back on the path to a healthier and more 
fulfilling life. It is essential that we recognize the importance of taking collective 
responsibility for the well-being of those in our community who are struggling, and to
do our part to provide support and resources to help them in their recovery.
Recovery housing is a crucial resource for pregnant women who are struggling with 
substance use disorder. These specialized facilities provide a safe and supportive 
environment for expectant mothers to addiction treatment while also receiving 
prenatal care. Recovery housing for pregnant women can help reduce the risk of 
preterm labor, low birth weight, and other complications associated with substance 
use disorder. These programs often offer counseling, education, and parenting skills 
to help women successfully transition to motherhood while maintaining sobriety. By 
addressing both addiction and maternal health, recovery housing can support positive 
outcomes for both mother and child.
LD 1116 looks to fill the gap in services for families struggling with addiction and 
supportive housing. This bill seeks funds for new housing units where reunification 
with children is the goal, requiring clinical and peer to peer support be available. 
Furthermore, it focuses on these needs in rural central and northern Maine.
We need to protect those of us who are truly most vulnerable. LD1116 came into 
fruition while working with Representive Supica and a friend who was unable to 
access the housing and support services because she had a 6-year-old child. I am 
hoping that by providing testimony we can turn the tide and support mothers and give 
them and their children a fighting chance. 
Sincerely,
Joseph Hartel
