 McCULLUM & McCULLUM ATTORNEYS AT LAW 8 Crosby Street P. O. Box 2188 Augusta, Maine 04338-2188  David M. McCullum                    Telephone: (207) 248-9312 Elizabeth A. McCullum                                                Facsimile: (207) 623-2081               Written Testimony of Libby McCullum, Esq. on LD 1240 An Act to Develop a Pilot Program to Provide Legal Representation to Families in the  Child Protection System Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary my name is Libby McCullum, Esq.  I have been a lawyer for children, and a guardian ad litem in child protective, family law matters, and probate court for over 30 years in Maine.  I am concerned that LD 1240 as written could negatively impact the safety and well-being of Maine children. I hope that you will consider including in the legislation the appointment of an attorney for the impacted children as is done in child protection court cases during the pre-petition process.   The purpose of Maine’s child protection system is to promote the safety and well-being of Maine children. Parents have a fundamental right to raise their children and state intervention should be the minimum necessary to ensure child safety and well-being. However, LD 1240 as written does not include safeguards to protect Maine children pre-petition. The proposed pilot project provides legal representation for all (DHHS & parents) but no representation for the impacted children as is required when a protective custody court case is filed. This scenario will create a power imbalance and the children at risk will only be heard through the lens of their parents or DHHS.  I would argue that defeats one of the central tenets of Maine’s child protection laws that children’s wishes are considered before state action. See 19-A M.R.S. § 1653(3)(C), 22 M.R.S. § 4005(E). I urge the Judiciary Committee if it intends to support this legislation to amend the bill to require appointments of an attorney for the impacted children so that their perspective is considered during this pre-petition process as well.  Thank you for your consideration. Libby McCullum, Esq.
