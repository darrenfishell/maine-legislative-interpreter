Testimony in Support of LD 1522: An Act to Provide Economic Justice to Historically 
Disadvantaged Older Citizens by Amending the Laws Governing the Medicare Savings 
Program  
 
Greetings Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services. I am Bridget Quinn, Associate State Director of 
Advocacy and Outreach for AARP Maine.  
 
AARP is the nation’s largest nonprofit, nonpa rtisan organization dedicated to empowering 
Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our more than 
200,000 members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony.  Today, I am 
testifying in favor of LD 1522.  
 
This bill, LD 1522, seeks to expand access to the Medicare Savings Programs  (MSP) . 
Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) help low -income older adults pay Medicare premiums 
and other out -of-pocket costs.  In Maine, 345,000 individuals depend on Medicare for access 
to he alth care services they need. Yet, many still struggle to pay medical bills and make the 
painful decisions to forgo care entirely. Out-of-pocket costs can add up quickly for many 
people with Medicare. An AARP Public Policy Institute analysis found that in 2018, people 
with traditional Medicare spent an average of $6,168 , nearly half of that went towards 
premiums. 1 
 
LD 1522 will increase access to the Medicare Savings Program by eliminating the asset test 
and changing the income eligibility methodology. Each of these is a worthy effort. It is 
critical to note that studies have shown that MSPs disproportionately help people of color, 
women, and individuals under age 65 with disabilities.2 According to the Kaiser Family 
Foundation , “49 percent of MSP enrollees identify as non -Hispanic white, 21 percent as 
Black or African American, 19 percent as Hispanic, 7 percent as Asian/Pacific Islander, and

The changes to the MSP eligibility proposed in LD 1522 have the opportunity to enable  
Mainer s to tackle critical healthcare costs . AARP’s Public Policy Institute’s report Underused 
Medicare Savings Programs Can Help Many More Older Adults Afford Health Ca re highlights  
that states that have a larger share of Medicare beneficiaries in MSPs have taken action to 
expand programs by increasing income limits, removing the assets limits or both. For 
example, Maine has increase d the income limits in the past and it  delivered real relief to 
thousands of Mainers, in 2007 new income limits were implemented and roughly  13,500 
Medicare beneficiates gained MSP coverage.4 
 
As of 2022, 10 states have eliminated an asset limit for MSP coverage.  This will allow more 
individuals to be eligible for MSP programs but have a secondary benefit of saving on 
administrative costs.  Alabama, Mississippi, and New York all have reported administrative 
savings in time and money from eliminating asset tests.5 
 
We would like to raise to this committee an additional item for consideration which could 
be added to LD 1522.  Medicare Savings Programs are historically, underutilized. A 2017 
Urban Institute report estimated that, on average, only about half of the peopl e eligible for 
MSPs nationally are signed up.6 This is in part due to a lack of awareness among Medicare 
beneficiaries and barriers that make accessing the programs difficult for eligible Mainers. 
We would encourage this Committee to consider adding langu age that will increase the use 
of MSPs by eligible Mainers by making the application process easier and adding language 
that will increase outreach and education efforts.  
 
Expanding  eligibility to the Medicare Savings Program in Maine will deliver real su pport to 
Mainers who  are currently struggling to cover their health -related expenses. We urge the 
committee to support LD 1522. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. If you have 
questions for me , I can be reached at bquinn@aarp.org  or at 207 -272 -8563 .
