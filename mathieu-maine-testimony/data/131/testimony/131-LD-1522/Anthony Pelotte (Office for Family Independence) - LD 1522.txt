Re:  LD 1522, An Act to Provide Economic Justice to Historic ally Disadvantaged Older Citizens

Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
Thank you for  the opportunity t o provide inpu t on LD 1522, An Act to Provide Economic Justice 
to Historically Disadvantaged Older Citizens by Amending the Laws Governing the Medicare 
Savings Program . DHHS has concerns with portions of the bill .  
 
We understand the sponsor is seeking to remove the portion of the bill that would eliminate t he 
Specified Low -Income Medicare Beneficiary ( SLMB ) tier of Medicare Savings Programs 
(MSPs ). We appreciate this as SLMB is a compulsory health care option under § 1902a  
(10)(E)(iii) of the Social Security Act.1 Given the federal re quirement, elimination would no t be 
allowable.   
 
LD 1522  additionally proposes the  use of the Elder Economic Security Standard Index ( the Elder 
Index ) as a means of income assessment for MSPs. This cont ent is not generated by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services  or other executive authority, nor is it acknowledged 
under  governing legislation or rule. Introducing an external metric into already defined 
procedures  is problematic. Maine’s existing approach conforms to regulatory  requirements , and 
we are concern ed that use of a metric  such as the Elde r Index would jeopardize compliance.  
Each MSP is significantly dependent on established Federal Poverty Level (FPL) a nd SSI-
guidelines, and Maine should continue to align its practices with these elements.  
 
MSP qualifications are addressed under 10 -144 C.M .R ch. 332, pt. 8 , and the bill amend s current 
criteria . Any related updates would need to be accepted by the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services ( CMS ). The Department would also need to educate both internal and public 
stakeholders about developm ents, and it would have to refine its technology to account for new 
data receipt and processing , as well as train Department staff. 
 
Removal of the asset limit  for this pro gram  woul d be contingent upon approval of a n 1115  
waiver by CMS.  
 
1 See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(10)(E)(iii); see also 42 C.F.R. § 435.124 and 42 C.F.R. § 435.10 .

information , we will be glad to provide that for the work sess ion.
