Greetings, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and the members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Health and Human Services. 
My name is Jess Maurer, and I am the Executive Director at the Maine Council on Aging (MCOA). The 
MCOA is a broad, multidisciplinary network of 135 organizations, businesses, municipalities, and older 
community members working to ensure we can all live healthy, engaged and secure lives with choices 
and opportunities as we age at home and in community settings. I am testifying in favor of LD 1522. 
Liberty and justice for all. These are words that have deep meaning to us, and yet sometimes we have 
blind spots that make it hard to see that some people who have experienced a lifetime of economic 
disparities and inequities have never had justice. LD 1522 is fueled by the belief that it’s never too late 
to secure justice for all. 
Economic justice is the idea that the economy will be healthier if we create meaningful opportunities 
for everyone to succeed. This concept often fails to reach back to provide justice for those who were 
not given a fair chance to succeed and are struggling to survive later in life. 
LD 1522 grew out of the report on the Economic Status of Older Women in Maine and our work on 
Equity and Healthy Aging. Here are just a few reasons we seek justice for older people: 
0 Maine women over 60 are nearly two times more likely than men to live at or below 150% of the 
Federal Poverty Level (FPL). 12% of women 80+ live in poverty as opposed to 6% of men.‘ 
0 2018 data shows Black or African American Mainers are more than 3 times as likely to 
experience poverty as white Mainers? Nationally, women of color over 80 years old live in 
poverty at a rate of 20%. 
0 Nationally, 17% of LGBTQ+ individuals have incomes below the Federal Poverty Level versus 
12% in straight people? 
0 52% of working-age Mainers with a disability live in or near poverty as opposed to 22% with no 
disability. In later life, women experience higher rates of disability than men.4

One way to deliver economic justice to older people is to increase eligibility for the Medicare Savings 
Program (MSP), a program that offers older people with lower incomes help to pay for some or all of 
their Medicare premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. 
While states must implement the minimum eligibility for this program, they are free to set higher 
eligibility levels. Indeed, a November 2021 memo from CMS entitled “Opportunities to Increase 
Medicare Savings Program Enrollment ” , the federal govemment seems to be encouraging elimination of 
asset tests and increased income eligibility for the program.5 
The federal government pays 100% of the cost for MSP Qualifying Individuals (QI). The federal 
government has never met the allocation for this program. States share the cost for the other two MSP 
Programs, the Speciﬁed Low-Income Medicare Beneﬁciary (SLMB) and Qualiﬁed Medicare 
Beneﬁciary (QMB). 
The QMB Program provides payment of Medicare Part A monthly premiums (when applicable), 
Medicare Part B monthly premiums and annual deductible, and co-insurance and deductible amounts for 
services covered under both Medicare Parts A and B. SLMB and QI Programs provide payment of 
Medicare Part B premium for the calendar year. Beyond eligibility levels and state cost-sharing, there is 
no distinction between SLMB and QI. People enrolled in MSP are automatically entitled to the full Part 
D Low-Income Subsidy, saving them thousands of dollars a year in Part D drug expenses. 
Eligibility for MSP must be set using the FPL, which is a simpliﬁed version of the poverty threshold 
measure and only includes the cost of food. While we cannot use any other standard, we can look to 
other reliable indicators to help us understand where to set eligibility levels to best provide economic 
justice and real help to older lower income people in Maine. While we cannot eliminate SLMB as we 
had originally thought, we can effectively eliminate it by setting the QMB level higher than the 
minimum income level for SLMB, essentially subsuming SLMB members. 
LD 1522 proposes to use the National Elder Economic Security Standard Index (Elder Index), 
developed by the Gerontology Institute at the University of Massachusetts Boston in 2006, as a more 
comprehensive measure of income needed to pay for food, healthcare, housing, transportation, and other 
essential needs for people over 65. The data is available for each state and county in the country and is 
updated every 4 years with COLAs on years the Elder Index isn’t adjusted The National Council on 
Aging maintains the Elder Index, which has been adopted by New Jersey, Califomia and Massachusetts 
to supply minimum income data for policy development. 
The methodology for creating the Elder Index has been published and peer-reviewed. The Elder Index 
considers whether an older person lives alone or in a couple, whether they rent or own their home with 
or without a mortgage, and their health status. For reasons described below, we believe Maine should 
look to the Elder Index to help establish the right MSP eligibility level, using the region of Maine, fora 
single person, in poor health who owns a home with a mortgage as the eligibility level for QI, anda 
single person in poor health who owns a home without a mortgage for QMB. 
People of color and from different ethnic origins experience higher rates of illness and death acrossa 
Wide range of health conditions in the United States when compared to their white counterparts.

Structural gender inequalities in the allocation of income, education, and health care are also strongly 
associated with poor health. LGBTQ+ people are at higher risk of certain conditions, have less access to 
health care, and have worse health outcomes nationally. 
From an economic justice standpoint then, it makes sense to consider the income needed for older 
people in poor health, as they generally need higher levels of income to cover needed medical and health 
expenses in addition to their other daily needs. There is also strong evidence that policies promoting 
economic equity may have broad positive health effects. 
In Maine, 80% of people 65+ own their homes and 37% of these homeowners have a mortgage. This is 
signiﬁcantly higher than the national average of 24%. Of the 20% of Mainers who rent, 46% are “rent- 
burdened ” — spending more than 30% of their household income on rent. As a signiﬁcant number of 
older Mainers require additional income to meet their housing needs, it is appropriate to use the highest 
income threshold in the Elder Index, home owner with a mortgage, to set the highest eligibility limit. 
Our current minimum Wage in Maine is equal to $28,704; this is the minimum amount of income we’ve 
said Mainers need to earn to live. All three current eligibility levels for QMB, SLMB and QI fall under 
the minimum wage. A livable Wage in Maine is $34,382. 
Using the Elder Index, an older person in poor health in Maine who owns their home with a mortgage 
needs $36,444 to meet their basic needs, not their long term care needs. An older person in poor health 
who owns their home with no mortgage needs $26,592. LD I522 directs the Department to establish 
eligibility for the MSP using these ﬁgures as a guide to set the eligibility to the nearest FPL number, in 
this case, QI would be set at 250% FPL. 
The bill also directs the Department to eliminate the asset test. As noted above, the Elder Index includes 
only the necessities and does not include What a person needs to meet their long term care needs. Older 
women in Maine are more likely to need long term supports and services than men, and less likely to be 
able to afford to pay for them. People who have done the right thing and saved for the eventuality that 
they will need to pay out of pocket for home care and home repair in later life should not be forced to 
spend down these savings to qualify for help that is available to others like them with lower incomes. 
Over the last 100 years, all racial groups have gained longevity in this country. For far too many who 
have been economically disadvantaged, this means having to live longer with fewer resources. 
Increasing eligibility for the MSP creates an opportunity for all older people to thrive and it will make 
our economy fairer. We urge you to join us in saying it’s never too late for justice by passing LD 1522. 
There are a few ﬂaws in the way the bill is currently drafted. We are happy to work with the 
Department on new language that will clarify the intent of this bill to provide economic justice by 
raising eligibility levels while complying with all of the federal rules. The Medicare Rights Center 
stands ready to assist. 
Thank you.

Despite caregivers ’ unpaid labor and direct support workers‘ underpaid work, long-term care costs are

At least half of older Maine women who live alone have difficulty covering their basic needs and will not be able 
to afford to pay for the support and care they need as they age. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Economic disparities over the course of a woman's lifetime mean that older Maine women are far more likely 
to live in poverty than Maine men. Due to higher rates of disability and the likelihood of living alone, older 
Maine women are more likely to need long-term supports and services. However, their higher rates of poverty 
make it less likely they will be able to afford those services. 
Policymakers, Maine state agencies, and Maine municipalities must work with experts and advocates to: 
' Create better statewide systems to support care like paid family medical leave and childcare 
improvements (birth through school age), and find additional ways to support unpaid caregivers. 
~ Fairly value and compensate professional caregivers including direct support workers and childcare 
providers, who are overwhelmingly women. 
~ Continue to address gender-based discrimination in wages and workplaces. 
Q Improve our long-term care systems, such as addressing gaps in long-term support and services, and 
expanding eligibility for programs that help people pay for those services. 
' Fund supports to help people live alone: aging in place home modification, home alert systems, increased 
access to accessory dwelling units, and targeted and consistent outreach to older Mainers who live alone.         
