Re:  LD 1522, An Act to Provide Economic Justice to Historically Disadv antaged Older Citizens 
by Amending the Laws Governing the Medicare Savings Program 
Sena tor Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Huma n Services: 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on LD 1522, An Act to Provide Economic Justice 
to Historically Disadv antaged Older Citizens by Amending the Laws Governing the Medicare 
Savings Program . DHHS has concerns with portions of the bill.  
We unde rstand the sponsor is seeking to remove the portion of the bill that would eliminate the 
Specified Low-Inc ome Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) tier of Medicare Savings Programs 
(MSPs). We appreciate this as SLMB is a compul sory health care option under § 1902a 
(10)(E)(iii) of the Socia l Security Act.1 Given the federa l requireme nt, elimination would not be 
allowable.  
LD 1522 addit ionally proposes the use of the Elder Economic Security Standa rd Inde x (the Elder 
Index) a s a means of income assessment for MSP s. This content is not generated by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services or other executive authority, no r is it acknowledged 
under gove rning legislation or rule. Introducing an external metric into alrea dy defined 
procedures is problematic . Maine’ s exist ing approach conforms to regulatory requirements, and 
we are concerned that use of a metric such as the Elde r Index would jeopardize compliance. 
Each MSP is significantly dependent on establishe d Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and SSI-
guidelines, and Maine should continue to align it s practice s with these elements. 
MSP qualifications are addressed under 10-144 C.M.R ch. 332, pt. 8, and the bill amends current 
criteria. A ny related updates would need to be accepted by the Center s for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS). The Department would also need to educa te both internal and public 
stakeholder s about developments, and it would have to refine its technolog y to account for new 
data receipt and processing, as well as train Department staff. 
Removal of the asset limit for this program would require submission of a state plan amendment 
to CMS.
