In Opposition to  
LD 1336 - An Act to Increase Transparency in Municipal Ballot Referenda Expenditures  
April 21, 2023
 
 
Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, and members of the State and Local Government Committee, my name is Rebecca 
Lambert, and I am testifying today in opposition to LD 1 336 on behalf of the  Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) 
elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC).  
  Municipal officials appreciate that this bill intends to provide a level of transparency  in municipal ballot 
referenda expenditures but are concerned with the undue burden that it will place on town and city clerks.   
When it comes to small communities  with little to no experience filing campaign finance reports, officials 
give pause to adding the administration of this program  to their duties. Furthermore, the reporting deadline would 
fall close to the November election which, as you are all acutely aware, is an intensely busy time for clerks.  
For these reasons the LPC kindly ask the  committee to vote ought not to pass on LD 1 336. Thank you for 
your time and for considering the municipal  perspective on this issue.
