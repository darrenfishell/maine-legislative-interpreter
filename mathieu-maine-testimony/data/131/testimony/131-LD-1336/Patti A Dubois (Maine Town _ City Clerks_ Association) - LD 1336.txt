Re: LD 1336 – An Act to Increase  Transparency  in Municipal  Ballot  Referenda  
Expenditures  
 
Position: Neither For Nor Against 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is neither for nor against LD 1336 and we thank 
you for the opportunity to outline our points for your committee. 
 
Some clerks supported the concept of all towns being held to the same standards and 
pointed out that the reporting forms would be designed by the Ethics Commission. 
However, most expressed concern about small communities who have no experience with 
filing campaign finance reports having to administer this program, since current municipal 
campaign finance reporting is only mandated in municipalities with a population over 
15,000.  Many felt that the $5,000 threshold was very low and could be easily met with a 
few TV or newspaper ads, which would result in more towns having to administer this 
reporting.  Clerks expressed concern that the reporting deadline would fall around a 
November election, which would only add more tasks to an already busy time for small 
offices that have limited staffing. 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association appreciates the opportunity to share its  
testimony with the Committee. Should any questions arise, please feel free to contact  me at
