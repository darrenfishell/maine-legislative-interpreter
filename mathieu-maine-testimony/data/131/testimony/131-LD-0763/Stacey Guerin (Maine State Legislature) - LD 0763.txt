Testimony of Senator Stacey Guerin 
Presenting L.D. 763, An Act to Provide Antlerless Deer Permits to Certain Landowners 
Before the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee 
March 20, 2023 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife: I am Senator Stacey Guerin and I represent District 
4, which includes all of Piscataquis County and ll communities in Penobscot County. I’m before 
you today to present L.D. 763, An Act to Provide Antlerless Deer Permits to Certain Landowners. 
I submitted this legislation after hearing from a constituent who would like to see antlerless deer 
permits made available to landowners. In an effort to make this amicable to a greater number of 
organizations and individuals, a few guidelines have been set in the bill. Landowners eligible for 
an antlerless deer permit would include those who l) do not post their property, and 2) own ten 
contiguous acres of land. While these individuals would be eligible for an antlerless deer permit, I 
would note that they would still need to pay the newly created $12 fee (and $2 agent fee?). 
I believe this proposal is a win-win for landowners, hunters, and the State of Maine. With more 
landowners posting their property and prohibiting hunters, this legislation actually incentivizes 
landowners to keep their property open. It also gives landowners and hunters greater opportunity 
to tag a deer, which will ultimately help the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife ’s (IF&W) 
efforts to manage Maine’s deer population. Finally, IF&W would continue to receive revenue to 
go to their Deer Management Fund. 
Thank you for your time and consideration of this legislation.
