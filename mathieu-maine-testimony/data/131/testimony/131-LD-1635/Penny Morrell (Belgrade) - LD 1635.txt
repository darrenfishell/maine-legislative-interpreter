Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Penny Morrell and I live in Belgrade, Maine. Thank you the 
opportunity to testify on L.D. 1635, “An Act to Charter a Maine State Bank That 
Accepts Deposits and Issues Gold Currency Celebrating Maine's Heritage." 
My husband, Barry, and I support this bill and thank Senator Brakey for 
introducing it. We favor gold and silver bullion being used for trade in Maine 
instead of the federal dollar system we are currently forced to use.   
By granting banking services to the underserved and increasing access to sound 
money, this proposed Maine State Bank would serve the Maine people in 
manners needed, but which the federal government has worked to undermine 
and deny with prohibition and inflation. 
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 1635.  Thank you. 
Barry and Penelope Morrell, Belgrade, Maine
