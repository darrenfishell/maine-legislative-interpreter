I have been a caregiver in the medical marijuana program since 2010.  It started out 
and continues to be an avenue of alternative relief for people who cannot find relief 
for various ailments.  It has never been accepted as mainstream despite the countless 
successes demonstrated at the state house over the years as well as at national and 
international levels. This lack of acceptance by society at large regarding the cannabis
reaches deep into the banking sector. 
Due to the fact that financial institutions are backed by organizations like the FDIC or
the NCUA they are very hesitant to assist cannabis related businesses.  Those that do 
place onerous regulations and fees that are not placed on any other business in the 
state. Monthly payments of $100 to maintain checking accounts makes it difficult for 
the smaller entities to stay in business.  The monthly fee doesn't regard the 0.8-1% fee
on all deposits as well.  
Maine has a thriving medical cannabis community that employs well over 2000 
individuals.  A state chartered bank would help each of these people and their small 
business maintain a bank account and keep them from veering toward any black 
market activity.  To see the benefits or success that a state bank could have one need 
look no further than Cport credit union.  They have branches sprouting up all over the 
place due to the fact they were one of the few institutions who accepted cannabis 
related businesses early on.
