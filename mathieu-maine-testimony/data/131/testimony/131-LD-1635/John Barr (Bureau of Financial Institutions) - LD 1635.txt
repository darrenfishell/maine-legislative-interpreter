RE:  Opposition to L.D. 1635, An Act to Charter a Maine State Bank That Accepts Deposits 
and Issues Gold Currency Celebrating Maine’s Heritage 
 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and Committee Members: 
 
The Bureau of Financial Institutions submits this letter on behalf of the Administration in 
opposition to the L.D. 1635, An Act to Charter a Maine State Bank That Accepts Deposits and 
Issues Gold Currency Celebrating Maine’s Heritage. 
 
The bill proposes to establish a Maine State-owned bank that would accept deposits from 
any person or entity of any type of foreign currency, U.S. currency, gold and silver bullion, or 
cryptocurrency. The proposed bank would also mint gold coins, issue a Maine State 
cryptocurrency redeemable in gold, and exchange various world currencies for other currencies, 
including for gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies.  
 
The proposed Maine State Bank would be a public body corporate and politic, a 
classification similar to the Finance Authority of Maine and the Maine Municipal Bond Bank. It 
would be run by a board of directors appointed by the Governor and would include the State 
Treasurer and the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services as ex officio 
nonvoting members. The finances of the bank would be subject to independent audit, which 
would include confirmation of 100% reserves on deposits. 
 
The Administration’s opposition to the bill stems from the following primary 
concerns. 
 
First, it is a costly multi-million dollar undertaking to establish and operate the proposed 
State-owned bank.  It would require State investment in physical facilities, secure vaults for 
precious metals, minting operations, information technology, and highly specialized

management, staff, and legal counsel.  Further, there would be significant ongoing costs to 
manage the organization, including expenses for the physical security needed to protect precious 
metals and the cybersecurity needed to protect cryptocurrency.  Because the proposed bank relies 
only on fees to pay overhead, it would likely demand significant ongoing taxpayer support until 
revenues cover expenses, if ever.  Fee revenue is uncertain, as there is no demonstrated demand 
for minting Maine gold coins, exchanging cash for gold, accepting crypto and foreign deposits, 
or issuing a State-run cryptocurrency.  
 
Second, unlike FAME and the Maine Municipal Bond Bank, the proposed Maine State 
Bank would provide little value to the State in terms of business growth or infrastructure 
development.  The proposed bank would have 100% reserves; thus holding all deposits and 
serving primarily as a vault. This means the State bank would not lend or invest in Maine 
communities.  Instead, it would siphon deposits from banks and credit unions, who would then 
have less money to loan to Maine citizens and businesses.  This outcome would have negative 
consequences for Maine’s economy.   
 
Third, the proposed Maine State Bank raises money laundering concerns.  A State bank 
engaged in issuing cryptocurrency, or engaged in currency exchange, would be attractive to 
criminal organizations seeking to legitimize their holdings of gold, cash, or cryptocurrency.  The 
ability to deposit any type of cryptocurrency, cash or bullion in a State institution and have it 
exchanged for other types of currency prior to withdrawal could facilitate money laundering.  
Illicit funds withdrawn from a State bank in a currency different than the initial deposit would 
appear free of suspicion given that the transaction was facilitated by a State bank, even though 
the funds remain the proceeds of an illegal scheme.  This potential would bring intense pressure 
on the State to ward off illegal activity. 
 
Fourth, in the event of an insolvency crisis due to operational decisions, or due to theft or 
other losses, Maine taxpayers would be required to absorb the expense of the insolvency or 
conservatorship. There would be no federal agency guarantying deposit accounts. 
 
Many State-owned bank bills have been proposed over the years and all have been 
rejected.  The Administration is opposed to this latest effort.  Thank you for your consideration.  
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,
