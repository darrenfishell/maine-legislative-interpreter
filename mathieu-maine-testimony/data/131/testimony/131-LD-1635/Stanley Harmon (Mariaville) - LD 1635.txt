This is a bill that has, at last, the long term financial interests of the people of Maine 
in mind.  I fully support it and note that this effort does not necessarily mirror the very
successful North Dakota State Bank, but is also a creative solution that will work.  I 
am a recently retired finance director (30 years) for the Town of Bar Harbor and have 
always followed these legislative efforts since I believe it will achieve benefits for 
municipalities too, favorably lowering the local property taxes by lowering borrowing
costs.  I also see this bank as a working partner with all the local banks in Maine in a 
win win solution.
