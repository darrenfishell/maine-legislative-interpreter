In Support of L.D. 1635 "An Act to Charter a Maine State Bank That Accepts 
Deposits and Issues Gold Currency Celebrating Maine's Heritage"
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Distinguished Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services, my 
name is Bill Smith and I live in Gorham. Thank you for the opportunity to testify in 
support of LD 1635.
Firstly I appreciate that this bank is purely a transactional bank and will not be 
involved in loans or security related activity. I also agree that it should not practice 
fractional reserve banking. 
I suggest that the president of the bank appointment and their salary be confirmed by 
the Maine Senate. 
In the current form the bill mentions requirements for mechanism to ensure 
transparency of functioning in Section 1256. I would suggest that the implementation 
of safeguards and such as referenced in this section be confirmed by the Maine Senate
and set in law at their inception. 
In closing I thank Senator Brakey and the cosponsors of this bill and ask you 
members of the Committee to vote OUGHT TO PASS for LD 1635. 
Thank you.
