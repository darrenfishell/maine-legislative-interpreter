LD 1635
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services:
Good morning. My name is Denise Gardiner, Belgrade,Maine. Thank you for your 
consideration of LD 1635.
My partner (Spencer D Jenney pf Belgrade, Maine) and I wish to throw our 
SUPPORT behind this bill. We are very much in favor of gold and silver bullion 
being used for trade in the state in lieu of the fiat federal dollar system we are 
currently "forced" to trade in. There are many of us who view unfavorably the 
implementation of a national CBDC system (and its surveillance apparatus) and who 
will not want to be part of it. It is vital that there remain some way for us to legally 
trade, pay bills, retain our land and homes, and function in society as FREE 
CITIZENS.
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS on this important bill, LD 1635.
Spencer D Jenney and Denise Gardiner
Belgrade, ME
