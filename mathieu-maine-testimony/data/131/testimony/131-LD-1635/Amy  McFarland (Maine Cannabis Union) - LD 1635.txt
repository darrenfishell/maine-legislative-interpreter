Amy  McFarland
Maine Cannabis Union
LD 1635
Good Day Ladies and Gentlemen of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services.
My name is Amy McFarland. I am a medical cannabis farmer and the President of the
Maine Cannabis Union. 
Today I am testifying is favor of LD# 1635, "An Act to Charter a Maine State Bank 
That Accepts Deposits and Issues Gold Currency Celebrating Maine's Heritage". 
As you are probably all aware, Maine has a robust cannabis industry.
One of the issues we face is banking. 
Due to federal regulations, our options are extremely limited. 
The banks that allow cannabis businesses to deposit charge them exorbitant fees. 
If passed, LD# 1635 would greatly benefit Mainers within the cannabis industry.
With that said, I ask you all to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD# 1635.
Thank you for your time,
Amy McFarland
President, Maine Cannabis Union
