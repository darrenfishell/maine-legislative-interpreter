Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services:
Good morning.  My name is Lisa E. Beal of Cherryfield, Maine.  Thank you for your consideration of 
LD 1635.  
My husband (Jonathan S. Beal of Cherryfield, Maine) and I wish to throw our SUPPORT behind this 
bill.  We are very much in favor of  gold and silver bullion being used for trade in the state in lieu of the
fiat federal dollar system we are currently "forced" to trade in.  There are many of us who view 
unfavorably the implementation of a national CBDC system (and its surveillance apparatus) and who 
will not want to be part of it.  It is vital that there remain some way for us to legally trade, pay bills, 
retain our land and homes, and function in society as FREE CITIZENS.
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS on this important bill, LD 1635.  
Jonathan S. and Lisa E. Beal
Cherryfield, ME
