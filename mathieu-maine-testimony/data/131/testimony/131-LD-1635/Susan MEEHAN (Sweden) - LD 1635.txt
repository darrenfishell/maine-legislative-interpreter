LD 1635
Honorable members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
Committee. Thank you for accepting this testimony in favor of ld 1635. My name is 
Susan Meehan and I live in Sweden Maine. I am a founding member of the Maine 
Cannabis Coalition and a Board member and founder of the Maine Cannabis 
Coalition, both large advocacy groups representing the over 100,000 patients and 
2200 caregivers in the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Program.  
2021 to 2021 was the first decline of caregivers in the program -- Maine lost over 
1000 small businesses in this largest agricultural crop in Maine industry in one year. 
This quarter billion dollar industry deserves access to fair and reasonable banking. In 
May 2021 our access to banking was compromised with an action by Cport that 
stemmed from FinCen regulations.  Cannabis is legal in Maine, and so to should 
banking in this industry be legal. Forcing businesses back to cash only is forcing 
businesses to close their doors and encourages development of an entirely new free 
market aka black market. This is not good for Maine economically nor per citizen 
safety. 
Please support Representative Brakey's and the other sponsors intent to form this 
State Bank. This is good for Maine on so many levels and in so many ways.
