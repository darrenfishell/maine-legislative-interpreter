LD 320
I am writing in support of LD 320, an act to support a ilot prgram within the Maine 
Multicultural Center to suppport the needs of foreign-trained workers. 
Through my work with LIteracy Vounteers, I know that many very intelligent and 
well trained people arrive in Maine from other countries and wind up accepting 
minimum wage jobs because they cannot translate their considerable skills to fit the 
needs of Maine businesses.  Both they and Maine are the losers in this circumstance.  
The proposed pilot program would make an enormous difference.
