LD 320
Dear Esteemed Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
I am writing in support of LD 320, in fully support of this bill as "An Act to support 
the Maine Multicultural Center". I wanted to write to speak to the impact it will have 
on all members of our community--from young to old.
As a member of the MMCC Board of Directors, I can attest to the impact it has had 
on our community. MMCC has offered community-based solutions by offering 
services and resources to our community at large. It promotes community enrichment 
and economic growth by attracting, retaining, supporting, and integrating all people of
diverse cultures and identity groups to greater Bangor.
Additionally, I wanted to express what MMCC has meant to my own family and 
many others who are from "away". As young, "New Mainer" family arrives, MMCC 
quickly becomes a safe have and lifeline for them because it celebrates and promotes 
racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity and gives people a sense of belonging. It also 
gives them an outlet to meet others from all around the world, which is healthy 
socially and emotionally. They are subsequently able to find a "home away from 
home", as they make new friendships. MMCC represents an equitable community that
builds bridges amongst people of all backgrounds, regardless of their social identities.
It fosters connections for them and helps the form lifetime friendships.
As such, I write in support of this bill which will provide the funds necessary for the 
enhancement of the MMCC to assist with more resources, presentations, 
conversations, workshops, and opportunities to help those from away settle in. The 
need is mutual for economic growth and development in our region! With these 
funds, I envision all the magic it will create for newcoming families, those 
well-established, and for generations to come! Thank you!
