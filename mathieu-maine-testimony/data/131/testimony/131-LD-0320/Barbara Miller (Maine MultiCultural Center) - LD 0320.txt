I am submitting testimony in favor of the proposed amendment  LD 320 “An Act 
to Support the Maine MultiCultural Center”  I have worked as a teacher of 
Multilingual Learners/ English for Speakers of Other Languages for Bangor Adult 
Education for almost 40 years. In this time I have seen the benefit to my students 
and the Greater Bangor Community as they have recently been supported by the 
Maine Multicultural Center by gaining employment, registering my students and 
their family members for school, getting medical care-including needed 
vaccinations, opening local bank accounts, getting a driver’s license and a place to 
live. 
MMCC support teams help with finding, furnishing and setting up homes in the 
area, getting New Mainers to English classes, and to medical appointments.  
MMCC sends children to summer camp and provides opportunities for families to 
socialize and practice English with a specialized literature-based program working 
with another community organization-Literacy Volunteers of Bangor. 
Bangor is well on its way to accepting 50 new individuals this year through 
Catholic Charites of Maine in addition to others who have come to make their 
new home in Bangor, seeing it as a small, welcoming community.  For the first 
time in almost 40 years there is a waiting list for students to attend Adult 
Education to learn to speak English.  The Maine MUltiCultural Center is a focal 
point centering all services and organizations to work together for the good of the 
Greater Bangor Area.
