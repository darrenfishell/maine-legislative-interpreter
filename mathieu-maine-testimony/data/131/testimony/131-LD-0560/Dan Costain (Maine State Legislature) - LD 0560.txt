Testimony in Supoport of: 
LD 560 ”An Act Regarding County Sheriff Vehicle Registration Plates” 
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and the distinguished members of the Joint 
Select Committee on Transportation. My name is Representative Dan Costain andI 
represent District 33 which includes the towns of Dixmont, Etna, Newport, Plymouth and 
Corinna. 
I am here today to present LD 560, “An Act Regarding County Sheriff Vehicle 
Registration Plates.” 
Currently, all Maine Sheriff s vehicles have the plain brown colored liscense plates with 
the Words, “Maine” and “Sheriff” as well as the plate number. This bill would allow each 
county to design their own liscense plate to better reﬂect the character of the areas that 
are patrolled as Well as to help better distinguish between agencies. 
It’s important to remember that through this process, there is no cost to the State. The 
vehicles will still be registered through the Secretary of State’s Office and meet the 
current required guidelines. This legislation aims for the liscense plates to have the 
individulism and instant recognition for residents of each county. 
The law enforcement ofﬁcers here today will go into greater detail by presenting their 
testimony, but as a former law enforcement ofﬁcer myself, I encourage you to support 
LD 560. 
I am happy to answer any questions you may have. 
Thank you. 
District 33 Corinna, Dixmont, Etna, Newport and Plymouth
